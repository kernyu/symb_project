A total of 185 strains of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus was investigated for sensitivity to five other antimicrobial agents. The vast majority of these strains were also resistant to gentamicin and fusidic acid. Rifampicin was the most active drug tested (MIC90, 0.007 mg/l), while two newer compounds teichomycin and ciprofloxacin showed equal and appreciable activity (MIC90, 0.5 mg/l).
