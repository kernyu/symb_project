Nourseothricin (streptothricin) causes disturbances (perforations) in the outer membrane of sensitive E. coli strains allowing lysozyme and deoxycholate, but not the periplasmic alkaline phosphatase to penetrate. EDTA slightly increases, but Mg++ ions slightly decrease this effect. The cell walls of three from four nourseothricin-resistant strains do not become permeable under these conditions, but remain sensitive against TRIS/EDTA. Nourseothricin is supposed to pass the outer membrane of sensitive bacteria via some kind of "self-promoting" pathway. This way can (but need not) be blocked in resistant strains.
