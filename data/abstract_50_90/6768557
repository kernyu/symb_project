Urinary infection is found in less than 10% of renal stone formers. It is three times more common in women than in men. Urea-splitting bacteria (Proteus, Klebsiella, pyocyaneus, staphylococcus) leading to stone formation are identified in two thirds of the cases. The percentage of the different bacteria varies depending upon the sex and degree of resistance to therapy. The sensitivity of bacteria to eight commonly used drugs was investigated.
