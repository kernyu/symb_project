The standardisation of a method to perform antibiograms using Meuller Hinton agar routinely is described. It was found that from 1973 to 1975 the resistance of E. coli to oxytetracycline decreased from 49% to 32.5% and to sulphonamides from 49% to 42.5%. Resistance to furazolidone increased from 12% to 22%. No dramatic changes in the resistance to neomycin and chloramphenicol were found.
