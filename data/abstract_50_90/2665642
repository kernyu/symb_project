Quinolone antimicrobial agents rapidly kill bacteria by largely unknown mechanisms. To study this phenomenon, a strain of Escherichia coli inhibited but inefficiently killed by (i.e., partially tolerant to) norfloxacin was isolated and characterized. E. coli KL16 (norfloxacin MIC, 0.10 microgram/ml; MBC, 0.20 microgram/ml) was mutagenized with nitrosoguanidine and cyclically exposed to 3 micrograms of norfloxacin per ml. After five cycles, a bacterial strain (DS1) which was killed 1,000-fold less than KL16 during 3 h of drug exposure was isolated. The MIC and MBC of norfloxacin for DS1 were 0.20 and 1.5 micrograms/ml, respectively. Over a range of norfloxacin concentrations, DS1 was killed 2 to 4 orders of magnitude less than KL16. DS1 grew more slowly than KL16 but after normalization for growth rate was killed four times less rapidly than KL16 at drug concentrations 10-fold higher than respective MICs. DS1 and KL16 cells filamented similarly upon exposure to norfloxacin. DS1 exhibited tolerance to other DNA gyrase A subunit antagonists (ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin) and DNA gyrase B subunit antagonists (novobiocin and coumermycin) but not to the aminoglycoside gentamicin, suggesting involvement of DNA gyrase. DS1 also appeared to be minimally tolerant to the beta-lactam cefoxitin. DS1 exhibited increased susceptibility to the mutagen methyl methanesulfonate, implying a defect in DNA repair. This report describes the first use of quinolone enrichment for isolation of a bacterial strain partially tolerant to quinolones. The study of defects in such tolerant strains offers an approach to an increased understanding of the mechanisms of bacterial killing by quinolones.
