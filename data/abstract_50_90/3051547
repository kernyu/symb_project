Sensitivity of Thai isolates of Plasmodium falciparum to chloroquine collected over the years 1978-1986 was measured by two methods: (i) by growth of previously cultured isolates for 72 h in presence of drug, and (ii) by the WHO standard in vitro microtest. During this period there were signs of a gradual increase in drug sensitivity, coinciding with the withdrawal of chloroquine for treatment of falciparum malaria in Thailand.
