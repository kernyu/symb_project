Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) are now causing severe clinical infection on a worldwide basis. Pulmonary infection due to MRSA although widely reported is poorly documented. We report the predisposing factors, underlying diseases, treatment and outcome in 4 patients with pneumonia, 3 patients with empyema thoracis, 1 patient with pneumonia and empyema thoracis, 1 patient with pneumonia plus lobectomy wound infection and 2 patients with lung abscess. Vancomycin was highly effective in treatment, a finding compatible with experience treating other severe MRSA infections.
