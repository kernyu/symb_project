The susceptibilities of 350 gram-positive cocci and 638 gram-negative bacilli to various antimicrobial agents were compared by using the Micro-Media system (MMS) (Fox Panel) (Micro-Media Systems, Inc., Potomac, Md.) and a standard agar dilution procedure. Major discrepancies occurred with enterococci, among which 48 of 53 isolates (91%) were found to be resistant to penicillin G by agar dilution and reported as susceptible by the MMS. Other large discrepancies occurred with Staphylococcus aureus and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus subsp. anitratus, among which more than 40% of the isolates were judged to be resistant to ampicillin by agar dilution and susceptible by the MMS. In terms of overall agreement in interpretation of MICs by the two systems, an agreement of greater than 84% was seen for both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms when ampicillin and cephalothin (68 and 78% agreement for gram-positive cocci, respectively) were excluded. These disagreements in MIC interpretations may result in part from the small number of organisms tested per well (4,000 CFU) in the MMS, as compared with 10,000 CFU per test in the agar dilution method.
