Rabbit eyes were inoculated with different concentrations of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Copious irrigation and topical Neosporin solution decreased surface contamination by 90% as compared to controls. Ps. aeruginosa added to M-K medium and stored at 4 degree C remained viable for 6 days and multiplied rapidly when the medium was incubated at 35 degree C. Adding penicillin and streptomycin (125 units/ml each) suppressed, but did not prevent this growth. Gentamicin (100 micrograms/ml) suppressed growth in all vials by 72 hours at 4 degree C. These studies show that gentamicin is clearly superior to penicillin and streptomycin in preventing Ps. aeruginosa contamination of donor corneas. It is suggested that donor eyes and M-K media be routinely cultured upon arrival at the eye-bank and the time of surgery in order to avoid or immediately treat gentamicin-resistant donor cornea contamination.
