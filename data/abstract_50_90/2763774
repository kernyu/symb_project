Surgical exploration is of prime importance in treating hand infections. In addition, it is essential to apply up-to-date and adequate antibiotic treatment. Authors employed antibiotics during the treatment of hand infections of 65 various aetiologies and types by considering the antibiotic sensitivity spectrum of the most frequent pathogens as also the effective concentration of the antibiotic acting in the inflammatory focus. For assessing effective antibiotic concentrations, samples were collected during exploration from the inflammatory tissues, and based on their assessments, it was pointed out that an adequate inhibitory antibiotic concentration cannot be reached by each antibiotic by applying it in the usual dose and way. The use of certain antibiotics is recommended in view of the most frequent pathogens of hand infections, of the spectrum of the antibiotic selected by the authors as well as in that of the measured tissue antibiotic concentrations in the dosage used by them. The effective application as well as dosage are also published. Regarding that, in practice, antibiotic treatment should be started according to the nature of the disease without knowing the spectrum of resistance and the pathogen, it is considered important for them to select initially, beside the surgical treatment, an antibiotic which is probably effective and is capable of entering in a sufficient amount the focus of inflammation.
