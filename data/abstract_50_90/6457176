Laboratory and clinical studies were performed on 6059-S in the field of pediatrics, a new semi-synthetic 1-oxacephem antibiotic, and results were as follows. 1. MICs of 6059-S were compared with those of cefazolin (CEZ) and cefmetazole (CMZ) on 31 strains of S. aureus, 29 strains of E. coli, 30 strains of K. pneumoniae and 16 strains of P. aeruginosa. With the inoculum size of 10(8) cells/ml an 10(6) cells/ml, the peak of distribution of MICs were S. aureus 6.25, 3.13 micrograms/ml, E. coli 0.2, 0.1 micrograms/ml, K. pneumoniae 0.2, 0.05 micrograms/ml and P. aeruginosa 12.5, 6.25 micrograms/ml, respectively. MICs 6059-S against S. aureus was more less 2 to 3 tubes than CEZ and CMZ, but against E. coli and K. pneunoniae were more higher than 3 to 4 tubes than CEZ and CMZ. 2. The serum concentrations and urinary recovery rate of 6059-S were measured in 5 pediatric patients. 6059-S was given 20 mg/kg by an intravenous injection to 2 cases or a 30 minutes intravenous drip infusion to 3 cases. The mean concentration of the former were 64.3, 44.3, 26.8, 11.7 and 5.0 micrograms/ml at 0.5, 1, 2, 4 and 6 hours, and T 1/2 was 1.51 hours. The urinary recovery rates was 75.0% within 6 hours after the injections. The mean concentration of the latter were 65.3, 86.3, 63.0, 40.3, 17.8 and 8.9 micrograms/ml at 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4 and 6 hours, and T 1/2 was 1.63 hours. The urinary recovery rates was 52.1% within 6 hours after the injection. 3. Eleven cases with acute pneumonia, 1 case with acute bronchitis, 3 cases with acute purulent tonsillitis, 1 case with acute purulent parotitis and 1 case subcutaneous abscess were treated with 6059-S by intravenous injection. All cases were above effective clinically. Five strains of H. influenzae, 3 strains of S. pneumoniae, 2 strains of S. pyogenes and 1 strain of S. aureus were eradicated in all strains. No clinical adverse reaction and abnormal laboratory findings were noted.
