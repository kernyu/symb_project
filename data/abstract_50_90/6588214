The authors treated 415 patients, with injection of 4 g cefmetazole (CMZ) per day after operation of the digestive tract. In these cases, the prevention of postoperative wound infections was investigated and the following results were obtained. Out of 415 cases, 11 cases (2.7%) had postoperative wound infections; 6 cases of which were superficial wound infections and 5 cases deep wound infections. In relation to the degree of infection of the surgical field of them, 10 cases were performed with the contamination by bowel organisms and 1 case was in infected surgical field. Bacteriological examination was carried out. Twenty-four strains of bacteria were isolated and identified. The major bacterial strains identified were 6 strains of S. faecalis, 4 strains of E. cloacae and 4 strains of P. aeruginosa. These organisms were rarely sensitive to CMZ. The results suggest that the organisms causing postoperative wound infections are changing compared with the organisms of previous reports and that the use of CMZ as a postoperative medication is useful in the prevention of wound infections.
