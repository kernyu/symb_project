The treatment of mucopurulent cervicitis in nonpregnant women was evaluated in a randomized study. Subjective and objective criteria were used to assess the response of cervicitis to therapy. Forty-three patients (Group I) were treated with Ofloxacin, 100 mg orally twice daily for 10 days, and forty-five patients (Group II) were treated with Ofloxacin, 200 mg orally twice daily for 7 days. Both produced significant improvement in subjective and objective signs of cervicitis; decreasing clinical symptoms, eliminating mucopurulent endocervical findings, and eradicating C. trachomatis. Overall, of the chlamydia-positive form the complete response of Ofloxacin treatment in mucopurulent cervicitis was 18 (60.0%), the partial response was 10 (33.3%), and resistance was 2 (6.6%) of the 30 patients (p = 0.6592). Of the chlamydia-negative form the complete response was 38 (65.5%), the partial response was 20 (34.5%) of the 58 patients (p = 0.9463). C. trachomatis eradication was satisfactory between both treatment regimens; 28 (93.3%) of the 30 women in chlamydia-positive form. This trial shows that both regimens are also beneficial in the treatment of mucopurulent cervicitis either C. trachomatis positive or C. trachomatis negative, and do not differ significantly between both groups (p = 0.1375). No side effects were observed.
