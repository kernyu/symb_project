In the presence of cycloheximide, wild-type plasmodia of Physarum polycephalum exhibit an immediate decrease in deoxyribonucleic acid synthesis, a reduction in the incorporation of [3H]thymidine into thymidine triphosphate, and an increase in the level of thymidine triphosphate, as well as a decrease in protein synthesis. In this study, we have utilized a cycloheximide-resistant (Cycr) amoebic strain selected from a population of cells mutagenized with nitrosoguanidine. Segregation data indicate that the resistance is due to a single mutation. We have used this Cycr mutant to construct Cycr plasmodial strains. Ribosomes isolated from such Cycr plasmodia showed resistance to cycloheximide in vitro, in contrast to ribosomes isolated from wild-type plasmodia. The Cycr plasmodia showed none of the cycloheximide-induced biochemical effects. Plasmodia heterozygous for the resistance marker were sensitive to cycloheximide with regard to growth but showed an intermediate response in the biochemical parameters. Heterokaryons formed by fusion of various proportions of the sensitive and resistant plasmodia showed a resistance with regard to both growth and biochemical parameters which was directly related to the fraction of Cycr plasmodia present in the heterokaryons. The data are consistent with the hypothesis that the effects of cycloheximide on deoxyribonucleic acid synthesis and nucleoside metabolism are secondary to the effect of the drug on protein synthesis in this organism.
