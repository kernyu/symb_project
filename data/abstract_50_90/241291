Pasteurization studies were conducted on 29 yeast and five lactic acid bacteria. In general the yeasts were more heat resistant in wine than were the bacteria. The one exception was a strain of Lactobacillus fructivorans that gave an average D-value of 1.7 min at 60 C. Alcohol was the wine constituent that had the greatest effect on resistance; D-values for all test species were inversely related to the ethanol concentration. The response of organisms to other factors such as pH, sugar, and sulfur dioxide varied with the species.
