We report the isolation and characterization of a mutator mutant in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. This mutator is of extrachromosomal, very likely mitochondrial, inheritance and acts exclusively on mitochondrial mtDNA. It greatly enhances the frequency of spontaneous mitochondrial drug-resistance mutants compared to the wild type, but it is not obligatory for their occurrence. In contrast, mitochondrial respiratory deficient mutants can only be isolated from mutator strains. It could be shown that this mutator induces point mutations as well as deletions in the mitochondrial genome which lead to respiratory deficiency. This mutator might prove to have a novel function encoded by the mtDNA.
