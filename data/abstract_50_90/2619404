Ever increasing interest is being displayed lately to simple, economic and standard systems for assay of antibiotic sensitivity of microbes with microtechniques in nutrient media requiring no raw materials in short supply. For determining sensitivity of Pseudomonas spp. to chemotherapeutics a liquid synthetic medium balanced by its cationic composition and containing no competing agents of sulfanylamides was used. Three procedures were comparatively estimated: the method of serial dilutions in the liquid medium with using immunological trays, the method of serial dilutions in agar and the diffusion test. In the estimation 185 strains of various Pseudomonas species were used: P. aeruginosa, P. cepacia, P. fluorescens, P. stutzeri, P. putida and P. pseudomallei. The method using the liquid synthetic medium and trays provided more precise interpretation of the results of the assay of the Pseudomonas spp. sensitivity to aminoglycosides, tetracycline, polymyxin and sulfamonomethoxine that the routine procedures. It showed some other advantages such as simplicity, low cost, low medium requirement and glassware economy. The application of the method allowed to exclude the use of expensive imported nutrient media in assay of sulfanylamide sensitivity.
