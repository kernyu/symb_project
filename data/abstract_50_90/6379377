In populations of an E. coli O26 strain three types of cells can be found which show different degrees of recipient ability in conjugation for an FII plasmid. In this paper the characterization of the plasmid used, pSMB35, is described and the conjugation-proficient mutants, O26SMB9 and O26SMB11, are compared for some of their properties.
