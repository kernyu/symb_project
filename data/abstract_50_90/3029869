Mycoplasma genetics has been limited by a lack of genetic tools such as selectable markers, methods to transfer DNA, and suitable vectors for cloning. Studies were undertaken to examine the potential of using the streptococcal transposon Tn916 as a mycoplasma genetic tool. The Escherichia coli plasmid pAM120, which contains Tn916, was transformed into Acholeplasma laidlawii and Mycoplasma pulmonis. Transposition of Tn916 into the mycoplasma chromosome apparently occurred by an excision-insertion mechanism. This example shows that newly introduced DNA from other bacteria can be successfully expressed in mycoplasma and that Tn916 should serve as a powerful genetic tool for the study of mycoplasmas.
