A prospective study of imported chloroquine-resistant falciparum malaria in the Netherlands is described. From 1979 to 1983, 77 non-immune patients were investigated; in 41 (53%) decreased sensitivity of Plasmodium falciparum to chloroquine could be confirmed. Signs and symptoms in these patients differ from the classical picture. Resistance to sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (Fansidar) was established in 6 patients. Parasitaemia was found twice during dapsone-pyrimethamine (Maloprim) prophylaxis. The implications for advice on treatment and prophylaxis are discussed.
