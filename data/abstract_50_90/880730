The interactions of iodine, iodide and triiodide with phosphatidylcholine multilayers have been investigated in order to find supporting data for conduction mechanisms of iodine-doped bimolecular lipid membranes. On the basis of order-disorder parameters it can be concluded that phospholipid multilayers interact with iodine rather than with its ionic forms. No evidence for the existence of triiodide chains in iodine-doped multilayers has been found. Consequently, the resistance-lowering effect of iodine must be based upon direct iodine-lipid interaction and iodine penetration rather than upon ion transport processes.
