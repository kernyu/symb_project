An outbreak of Corynebacterium group D2 urinary tract infections was recently observed at Nice CHR. These infections were characterized by alkaline urine. The five first cases were reported in the same department and the ten other cases were latter observed in different departments. Age average was 79 and all patients had either an intra-vesical catheter of a urinary collector. Among samples of material tested, only one gave a positive culture. The 15 isolates showed a similar identification and antibiotic phenotype. These strains presented a multiple antibiotic resistance: resistance to beta-lactams, aminoglycosides (except streptomycin), erythromycin, chloramphenicol, tetracyclines. All strains were susceptible to rifampin, pristinamycin, fusidic acid and vancomycin.
