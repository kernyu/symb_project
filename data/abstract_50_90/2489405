We have used spore isolation by the sodium thioglycolate-lysozyme technique on collected stools. Of the 51 stools studied, we found 41% of Clostridium perfringens with an average ratio of 10(4) germs/gr. 15 strains were typical double hemolysis and trehalose positive-5 presented only one hemolysis and were trehalose negative. We only found a single strain of Clostridium difficile with a rate of 10(4) germs/gr in the stools of a 10 months infant.
