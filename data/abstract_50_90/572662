For ten years, a 25-year-old immune-competent man experienced a progressive disseminated infection with the saprophytic soil fungus, Curvularia lunata, following presumptive cutaneous inoculation while playing football. Deep, soft tissue abscesses, pulmonary suppuration, paravertebral abscess, and cerebral abscess all followed leg ulcers from neglected abrasions. The patient's delay in obtaining treatment was partially responsible for the paravertebral-mediastinal-pleural-cutaneous fistula that resulted. The importance of prompt and aggressive surgical drainage procedures is clear. Infection was arrested only by surgery. The fungus was inhibited by miconazole nitrate and amphotericin B but it developed resistance to flucytosine. Miconazole appeared to cause resolution of the cerebral abscess. Amphotericin B (1 mg/kg/day) clearly was beneficial but only after effective drainage procedures were done. The patient refused to continue amphotericin B after 5.4 g had been given in two treatments. He became bedridden one year later from back pain that was caused by recurrent disease.
