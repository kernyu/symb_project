The tests carried out on the strains of Vibrio cholerae of the El Tor biotype, isolated during the epidemic in Apulia in 1973, brought to light the sensitivity of all the strains to various antibiotics and chemotherapeutic substances. Only one initially sensitive strain, when it was isolated again in the same patient, proved to be resistant to tetracycline. On the basis of this discovery and others communicated in published works, the Authors outline the problems posed by the emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains, especially when the resistance involves R factors.
