Fourteen patients with chronic osteomyelitis were treated with oral penicillin, oxacillin, or cloxacillin at a dose of 5 gm/day, plus 0.5 gm of probenecid (Benemid) three or four times per day. Treatment was continued for 2 1/2 to six months. In ten patients, evidence of osteomyelitis disappeared and there has been no recurrence during follow-up periods varying from six months to 2 1/2 years. Significant hepatotoxicity was encountered in two patients; one similar patient, not in this series but receiving a similar regimen of antibiotic, developed leukipenia. Thus, patients with chronic osteomyelitis appear to benefit from such a therapeutic program, but they must be monitored closely for hepatic or hematologic toxicity.
