The antimicrobial susceptibility to 11 antibiotics was determined of 358 streptococcal isolates representing six species was determined. All isolates were from milk samples obtained from clinical or subclinical cases of bovine mastitis. Agar disk diffusion zone diameters and minimum inhibitory concentrations were obtained for all isolates. Of the antibiotics tested that are available for mastitis therapy, cephalothin, penicillin, ampicillin, novobiocin, and erythromycin demonstrated acceptable activity against nonenterococcal streptococci, but only penicillin and ampicillin demonstrated moderate activity against Enterococcus faecalis. Enterococcus faecalis demonstrated substantial resistance to cephalothin, erythromycin, gentamicin, streptomycin, and tetracycline, while the nonenterococcal streptococci demonstrated substantial resistance to gentamicin, streptomycin, and tetracycline. Streptococcus uberis demonstrated greater antibiotic resistance than did Streptococcus dysgalactiae, while Aerococcus viridans demonstrated the greatest overall resistance of the nonenterococcal species.
