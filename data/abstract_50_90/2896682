One-hundred-and-eighteen endemic patient isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae, collected consecutively from clinical specimens of renal patients over a 3 1/2-year period, were studied using biotypes and antimicrobial sensitivity patterns as epidemiological markers. Minor temporal clusters were demonstrable among the more commonly occurring biotypes and resistance types, and comprised isolates acquired inside and outside the renal department. Among isolates acquired in the department two clusters could be demonstrated, in peritoneal dialysate and respiratory tract specimens. Both extended over the whole observation period and occurred independently of the temporal clusters described above. They may have represented common-source outbreaks, but further elucidation was not possible with the data obtained.
