In this study we evaluated the susceptibility of 127 gram negative bacteria isolated from urine cultures, to TMP-SMX and Ofloxacin in vitro by disk diffusion technique. While 91 percent of bacteria were sensitive to Ofloxacin, only 50 percent were sensitive to TMP-SMX. This resistance to TMP-SMX is compared with similar results of other studies.
