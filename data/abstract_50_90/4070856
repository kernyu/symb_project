The Staphylococcus aureus infections seen in general practice still respond relatively well to the usual treatments, including penicillin M, first generation cephalosporins or synergistins. Those seen in hospitals are highly resistant to oxacillin (14 to 43 h depending on individual hospital units) and should be treated from the start with major antistaphylococcal drugs, such as vancomycin, fosfomycin in combination therapy or pefloxacine.
