Plasmid-mediated amikacin resistance in Klebsiella pneumoniae resides on a 1.5-kilobase BamHI fragment which is part of the Tn3-related multiresistance transposon Tn1331. In this work, we present the complete nucleotide sequence of the amikacin resistance gene and the neighboring sequences. Maxicell experiments detected only one polypeptide of 23 kilodaltons, the product of one of the open reading frames identified as ORF I. Comparison of the complete sequence with that of Tn3 indicated that 396 base pairs located just upstream from ORF I are identical to a region between the end of the tnpR gene and the first six amino acids of the beta-lactamase transcript. Sequences which may act as hot spots for recombination were identified. One was located just after amino acid 6 of beta-lactamase, and the other was located at the end of the amikacin resistance gene.
