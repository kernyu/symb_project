Many viral infections induce interferon (IFN) production and cause insulin resistance. To examine the causal relationship between IFN and insulin resistance, we injected natural human leukocyte IFN-alpha (3 x 10(6) IU, i.m.) twice overnight in eight healthy subjects and determined oral (OGT) and intravenous (IVGT) glucose tolerance and sensitivity to insulin (287 nmol or 40 mU.m-2.min-1 euglycemic insulin clamp) the following morning. IFN caused mild influenzalike symptoms and induced a rise in circulating glucose, insulin, hydrocortisone (cortisol), growth hormone, and glucagon concentrations (P less than .05-.001). In the OGT test, the area under the glucose curve was 2.6-fold greater (P less than .02), and the disappearance rate of intravenously administered glucose was reduced by 28% (P less than .05) after IFN administration. The impairment in OGT and IVGT occurred despite augmented insulin response. Insulin-stimulated glucose disposal was reduced by 22% (P less than .005), and insulin clearance increased by 18% (P less than .02) after IFN administration. When the insulin-clamp study was repeated in patients with steady-state hyperinsulinemia that was 12% higher (P less than .005) after IFN, the glucose disposal rate was still reduced by 15% (P less than .01). These data indicate that IFN 1) stimulates counterregulatory hormone secretion, 2) impairs glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity, and 3) stimulates insulin clearance. Thus, IFN may be involved in the development of insulin resistance during viral infections.
