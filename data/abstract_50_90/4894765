In the infection of Escherichia coli B(P1) with restricted T1, it was shown that yielder cells consist of both special and nonspecial cells. Special or predetermined yielders occurred only among the earliest yielders. In most instances, yielder-cell formation was most easily explained by assuming that the first step was a chance escape of the restricted phage DNA from the degrading enzyme of the restricting cell.
