Strains of Campylobacter jejuni and C coli from human and animal sources were assessed for pathogenicity by their capability to produce abortions in pregnant guinea pigs. The pathogenicity rate varied from 7% to 87% for the C jejuni strains and from 0% to 53% for the C coli strains. Plasmid carriage was not found to correlate with pathogenicity as determined by ability of the strains to produce abortions in the pregnant guinea pig model.
