Streptococcus lactis subsp. diacetylactis DRC3 was examined for plasmid DNA and found to contain a previously unreported plasmid of 40 X 10(6) daltons. This plasmid, designated pNP40, was conjugally transferred to a plasmid-cured derivative of S. lactis C2. Transconjugants containing pNP40 acquired resistance to nisin produced by strains of S. lactis and to commercially available nisin when assay plates were incubated at 21, 32, and 37 degrees C. In addition, c2 phage growth was completely restricted in transconjugants containing pNP40 at 21 and 32 degrees C, but not at 37 degrees C. This result suggests that pNP40 may be coding for a temperature-sensitive enzyme that restricts phage growth at 21 and 32 degrees C, but not at 37 degrees C. Eight consecutive transfers of a transconjugant containing pNP40 in Elliker broth at 37 degrees C resulted in 100% loss of resistance to c2 phage when colonies were tested at 32 degrees C. These phage-sensitive isolates had lost pNP40 and had also become sensitive to nisin. This result suggests that pNP40 may also be thermosensitive in its replication. The finding of a phage resistance determinant located on a conjugative plasmid should prove useful in constructing phage-resistant variants for dairy fermentation processes.
