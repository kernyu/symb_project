We studied the effect of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) and saccharin on the frequency of induced mutations of resistance to 6-mercaptopurine and ouabain in Chinese hamster and mouse cells. UV-rays, bovine adenovirus-3 (BAV-3) and 5-bromdeoxyuridine (BrdU) were used as mutagens. In the case of BAV-3 and BrdU, we investigated, apart from the mutagenic effect, the tumor-inducing activity of these mutagens in mice, BrdU proved to have no carcinogenic effect. The data about the influence of TPA on the mutagenic effect of the three different mutagens indicate that TPA increases the frequency of the gene mutations induced by UV-rays and BAV-3. The results of the study of BrdU and TPA combined action revealed the fact that TPA does not increase the mutagenic effect of BrdU. We demonstrated that saccharin also possesses the promoter activity; it increases the mutagenic effect of BAV-3. The results described above lead to the assumption that TPA influence on the mutagenic effect only takes place when carcinogenic mutagens are used.
