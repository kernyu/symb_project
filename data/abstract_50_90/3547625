Populations of resistant bacteria emerge by the operation of selective pressure on resistant bacteria. The acquisition of resistance by sensitive bacteria is dependent upon the genetic determinant of the resistance, and its ability to move between different bacterial cells and within cells between different replicons. In contrast to chromosomal mediated resistance, plasmids and transposable elements coding for resistance to antibiotics have been the major factors in the spread of resistance and the prevalence of resistant bacteria in humans, farm animals and poultry. Different types of R-factors can be described. Resistance to ampicillin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, trimethoprim, erythromycin may exemplify epidemiological aspects of resistance genes in Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. The ecological destiny of resistant bacterial populations suggests the role of other factors than antibiotic resistance: characters of a particular host, host-plasmid relationship and properties which may lead to survival and adaptation in a given niche.
