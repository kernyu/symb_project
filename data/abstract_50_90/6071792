Staphylococcus aureus 196E was treated with 0.05% hydrogen peroxide in milk under varying conditions to determine the effects of treatment conditions and characteristics of the culture on bactericidal effectiveness of hydrogen peroxide. Time intervals required for 90 to 99.99% destruction of S. aureus decreased significantly as treatment temperatures increased from 37.8 to 57.2 C. Plots of survivor curves showed extended lags in destruction at 37.8 C, slight lags followed by logarithmic rates of destruction at 48.9 C, and logarithmic rates at 54.4 and 57.2 C except for trials in which there was very rapid initial destruction followed by logarithmic rates. S. aureus 196E was significantly more resistant to heat treatments at 54.4 C without added hydrogen peroxide than to treatment with 0.05% hydrogen peroxide at this temperature. Cultures grown at 37 C for 16 hr in milk were more resistant to hydrogen peroxide than were cultures grown at 35 C. Storage of cultures for 96 hr in milk at 4 C caused a decrease in the resistance of the culture. Numbers of staphylococci being treated had little effect on rates of destruction.
