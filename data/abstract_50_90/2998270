The effect of blastolysin, a glycopeptide of the cell walls of L. bulgaricus, on the resistance of mice to infections caused by S. typhimurium and B. pertussis, lysozyme levels in the blood serum and 5'-nucleotidase activity of peritoneal macrophages was studied. The changes in the nonspecific resistance of mice due to the effect of blastolysin depended on the administration route and the type of the developing infection. It activated the enzymatic activity of the peritoneal macrophages and changed the lysozyme levels in the blood serum of mice. The optimal protective effect of blastolysin was achieved on intramuscular injection in a dose of 100 micrograms.
