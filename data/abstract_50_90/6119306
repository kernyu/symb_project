We constructed a restriction endonuclease map of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa narrow-host-range plasmid R91-5. Insertions of transposons Tn7 and Tn501 into the plasmid DNA were characterized physically and genetically. The distribution of sites of insertion showed some regional specificity for the insertion of these transposons, especially TN501. The insertion of Tn7 was unusual in that all 42 of 43 insertions were in the same orientation. By relating phenotypic changes to the site of insertion, the Tn1 transposon that was already present on R91-5 and coded for carbenicillin resistance was mapped, and its orientation was determined. Two major transfer regions were identified. We believe that Tra1 is involved in conjugal DNA metabolism, whereas Tra2 is involved mainly in production of the sex pili.
