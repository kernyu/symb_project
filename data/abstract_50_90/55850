From Aug. 1, 1974, to July 31, 1975, inclusive, 19-1% of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 50-0% of Serratia marcescens isolates from a general hospital were gentamicin resistant as determined by standardised disc testing; 80% of 118 different clinical isolates showed minimum inhibitory concentrations larger than or equal to 16 mug/ml of gentamicin in agar-dilution testing. All gentamicin-resistant S. marcescens and 79% of Ps. aeruginosa isolates were susceptible to amikacin, while tobramycin and sisomicin were shown to have little advantage over gentamicin. A wide variety of immunotypes was found for Ps. aeruginosa, but only two predominant types were found for S. marcescens. Most isolates originated from the urinary tract, but nine which came from urine or wounds were also isolated from blood. Resistant strains seemed to be as virulent as sensitive strains. A common source was not found. Clinical improvement was noted in 13 of 17 patients treated with amikacin. The high frequency of gentamicin resistance is a continuing problem in this hospital and soon may be in others.
