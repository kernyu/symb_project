In 1980-1986 the sensitivity of 2,045 H. influenzae strains isolated from the bronchial contents of patients with inflammatory lung diseases were studied. This study revealed that 60-80% of H. influenzae cultures circulating in Leningrad were sensitive to tetracyclin, chloramphenicol and erythromycin. During the period of observation the tendency towards the decrease of the number of highly sensitive H. influenzae cultures and the increase of the number of strains resistant to all antibiotic preparations was followed. Most of H. influenzae strains isolated in Leningrad were sensitive to penicillin, oleandomycin and ampicillin. In 1983 the appearance of H. influenzae strains, multiresistant to antibiotics, was noted. In 1986 these strains constituted 4.5% of all isolated cultures.
