Aqueous, alcoholic and ketonic extracts were prepared from different parts of species of the families Martiniaceae, Caricaceae, Umbeliferae, Nictaginaceae and Fitolacaceae in order to prove their antimicrobial action on bacteria which have a clinical interest in humans and live in our environment. The gel double-layer diffusion method was applied. The best results were obtained from Carica papaya leave extracts.
