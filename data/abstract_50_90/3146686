The 65-year-old male patient of esophageal cancer before operation suffered from lobar pneumonia. Bacteriological examination identified MRSA in his sputum and catheter tip. None of the cefem type antibiotics were effective, but CLDM and MINO were so much effective against that. We studied 47 cases of esophageal cancer which received operation last year. In many bacteria which were identified in the sputum and pus, MRSA occupied 30% as well as Pseud. aeruginosa. In the preoperative period enteral nutrition (ED) may be acceptable, if possible, as nutritional support alternative to TPN.
