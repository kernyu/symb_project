Biopsy of a wound infection of the palmar fascia in a young diabetic woman revealed characteristic periodic acid-Schiff-positive Prototheca species cells with a rosette configuration and internal septation. Prototheca wickerhamii was cultured repeatedly from the wound drainage and the biopsy tissue. Several diagnostic features distinguishing Prototheca species, saprophytic algae, from yeasts are: the formation of endospores by mitosis; greater variation in cell size (2 to 15 mum); the presence of cytoplasmic granules, particularly in old cultures; and the absence of budding forms and pseudomycelia. The organism was resistant to 5-fluorocytosine and the minimal inhibitory concentration of amphotericin B was 12.5 mug/ml. With the exception of the tetracycline group, all other 16 antibacterial agents tested appeared completely ineffective in vitro. A synergism between amphotericin B and tetracycline was clearly demonstrated by the use of the checkerboard method. Infection by Prototheca species may be more common than presently realized due to the common expedient of identifying yeast-like isolates as "yeast--not Candida albicans."
