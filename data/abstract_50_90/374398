The 36-megadalton Haemophilus influenzae R plasmid pHK539 was found to specify resistance to tetracycline (Tc) and ampicillin (Ap). It was shown by molecular hybridization studies and by electron microscopy that the plasmid pHK539 contained the tetracycline translocation deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)segment (TnTc) as well as the ampicillin translocation segment (TnAp). The TnAp was integrated in the stem of TnTc. The 34-megadalton H. influenzae R plasmid pRI234 carried a translocatable DNA segment which specified both tetracycline and chloramphenicol (Cm) resistance. Self-annealing and DNA-DNA heteroduplex experiments indicated that this transposon is probably composed of TnTc containing an insertion of a chloramphenicol resistance transposon (TnCm). TnCm is inserted into one of the components of the TnTc inverted repetitions and is itself flanked on both sides by long inverted repetitions. The H. influenzae plasmids pHK539 and pRI234 had more than 60% of their polynucleotide sequences in common with all the other 30- to 40-megadalton R factors recently found in H. influenzae isolates from different countries. The tetracycline-chloramphenicol resistance transposon of pRI234 was integrated twice at different sites in the plasmid after its growth in medium containing tetracycline. The presence of the two copies of the transposon was correlated with higher minimum inhibitory concentrations against tetracycline as well as against chloramphenicol. After its growth in medium containing tetracycline, the H. influenzae R plasmid pFR16017 specifying Tc resistance contained one, two, three, or even four copies of TnTc integrated at different sites in the plasmid, or the loop of TnTc was amplified. The heterogeneity of the pFR16017 plasmid was seen in all single-colony isolates and correlated with a higher minimum inhibitory concentration against tetracycline.
