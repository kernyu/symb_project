We report a case of osteomyelitis due to a strain of Bacteroides uniformis highly resistant to clindamycin. The patient failed to respond to intravenous clindamycin therapy and eventually required amputation. This is the first documented occurrence of high-level clindamycin resistance in a clinical isolate of B. uniformis.
