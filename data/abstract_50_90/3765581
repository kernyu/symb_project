A total of 226 patients with exacerbated chronic pyelonephritis were studied and the effect of 10-day antibacterial course--followed up. In 178 cases the treatment was consistent with the drug susceptibility of urine microflora and in 48, it was carried out in the absence of such susceptibility. The susceptible strains were affected in a considerably higher percentage (64.60) than the nonsusceptible (41.67). The chronic renal insufficiency (ChRI) has been a factor restricting the effectiveness of the antibacterial agents. Out of III affected patients 24 (21.62%) were with ChRI, whereas they were 38 (46.34%) from not-affected ones. It has been concluded that the treatment of chronic exacerbated pyelonephritis should individually be carried out with a dynamic microbiological control.
