Mefloquine, a new antimalarial which has been effective in curing malaria due to Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax, was used for the first time in a patient infected with P. malariae. Treatment was successful, and the relatively long parasite clearance time and fever clearance time were probably characteristic of P. malariae rather than true drug resistance.
