Using colony hybridization techniques and DNA probes derived from four distinct tetracycline resistance determinants, we have examined the frequency of these determinants among 225 lactose-fermenting coliforms isolated from fecal samples of both humans and animals. The class B, or Tn10-type determinant, occurred most frequently at 73.3%, followed by class A (on RP1) at 21.7%, and class C (on pSC101) at 8%; 3.5% of isolates harbored two of these determinants. Hybridization to class D, carried by plasmid RA1, was not found among any of the isolates. One isolate failed to hybridize to any of the probes and represents a fifth class of determinant. No dramatic differences were observed in the frequencies of these determinants among four populations examined: hospital, urban, rural, and laboratory. At low stringency conditions of hybridization we were able to demonstrate cross-hybridization of determinant A with class C DNA and limited reaction with class B DNA, but no reaction with class D DNA.
