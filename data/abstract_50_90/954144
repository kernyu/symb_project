Mice respond to intravenous injection of homologous methylated RNA by the production of a circulating interferon-like substance. The treatment with modified RNA induces a significant protection against viral infection. This effect is optimum when the treatment occurs a few hours before viral infection. The protective effect is a peculiar property of homologous methylated RNA as heterologous RNAs do not induce any resistance to the infection with influenza virus.
