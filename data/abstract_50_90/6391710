The authors report a case of malaria from Burundi, due to chloroquine resistant Plasmodium falciparum. It is the second case of chloroquine resistance, confirmed by in vitro tests, in this country. Decreased sensitivity to quinine is demonstrated by in vivo study, and quinine assay. The isolate was sensitive to amodiaquine and mefloquine in vitro.
