The in vitro activity of azithromycin (CP 62,993 or XZ-450) against Haemophilus influenzae was greater than that of three other macrolides. However, azithromycin was four- to eightfold less active than erythromycin against the gram-positive cocci and against Listeria monocytogenes. Erythromycin and azithromycin were similar in their activity against Legionella pneumophila, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Neisseria meningitidis, and Branhamella catarrhalis.
