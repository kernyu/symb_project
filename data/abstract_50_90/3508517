The purpose of the investigations was to determine antifungal activity of iodophores: Pollena-Jod K and Mycofix. In vitro studies 3 strains of Trichophyton mentagrophytes from Sabouraud liquid medium and arthrospores of this fungus in skin scrapings obtained from sick foxes were examined. The in vivo fungicidal effect of the iodophores was studied in foxes and in young bulls, where 5 and 10% solutions of the preparations were used three times. It was found that the exact inactivation of arthrospores is possible when 8-fold or even 10-fold higher concentrations of the preparations were used than that used for inactivation of vegetative cells. After 1 h exposition vegetative cells were destroyed by 0.4% solution of Pollena-Jod K or Mycofix, however, 5% solution of Pollena-Jod K and 3% solution of Mycofix destroyed arthrospores. In the field studies Mycofix revealed higher fungicidal effects. The index of isolation of the fungus from skin scrapings for animals treated with Mycofix was lower by 38% in comparison to that for animals treated with Pollena-Jod K. Despite three times application of 5% and 10% solutions of the examined iodophores on fungal foci in animals, a part of arthrospores survived. For the determination of fungicidal activity of antimycotic drugs used to prevent or control of dermatomycoses, arthrospores present in skin scrapings of sick animals may be used.
