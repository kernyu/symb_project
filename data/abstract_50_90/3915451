The authors report three clinical observations of drug resistance; two of them have their origin in French Guiana and the third one in East Africa. They note that these cases are linked to bad advice of prevention concerning the risk of malaria, diagnosis carried out sometimes late for these zones of resistance; they recommend: to inform and teach the patient how to use a self-treatment in case of bout of malaria, to give better advice to the Physicians concerning the reality of malaria in 1985 instead of using a complex diagram of chemoprophylaxis.
