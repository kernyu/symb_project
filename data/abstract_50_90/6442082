Fecal samples obtained from 51 chronic carriers of S. typhi and S. schottmuelleri and from 35 healthy persons were studied. Strains of different species of Enterobacteriaceae were isolated and identified. The resistance of the isolated strains to the most commonly used antibiotics was determined. The fecal samples of the carriers were found to yield a greater number of strains than those of the healthy persons. Among the strains isolated from the carriers a variety of species was noted. S. typhi and S. schottmuelleri strains were found to be sensitive to the tested antibiotics. Antibiotic-resistant strains were mostly isolated from members of the medical staff.
