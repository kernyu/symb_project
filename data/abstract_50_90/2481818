Binding of TRH to specific cell surface receptors on clonal GH4C1 cells is followed within 10 min by receptor sequestration and over 24 h by receptor down-regulation. These experiments were designed to determine if TRH-activated second messenger systems are responsible for changes in receptor localization or number. BAY K8644 and A23187, which increase intracellular calcium, alone or together with 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate (TPA), which activates protein kinase C, did not appear to internalize TRH receptors. Drug treatment did not alter the rate of [3H]MeTRH association or internalization, determined by resistance to an acid/salt wash, or the amount of [3H]MeTRH able to bind at 0 C, where only surface receptors are accessible. TPA (0-100 nM) alone or in combination with BAY K8644 or A23187, also failed to change receptor number or affinity after 48 h when TRH caused a 75% decrease in the density of specific binding sites. Chlordiazepoxide has been reported antagonize TRH binding and TRH-induced phospholipid breakdown. Chlordiazepoxide shifted the dose-response curves for TRH stimulation of PRL release and synthesis to the right, and did not change PRL release alone. The affinity of receptors for chlordiazepoxide was not affected by a nonhydrolyzable analog of GTP whereas affinity for TRH was decreased; these properties are consistent with the classification of chlordiazepoxide as a competitive antagonist. Several experiments tested whether chlordiazepoxide would cause receptor internalization and down-regulation. Chlordiazepoxide did not appear to internalize TRH receptors, because TRH-binding sites became available rapidly and at the same rate after they had been saturated with chlordiazepoxide at 0 or 37 C.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
