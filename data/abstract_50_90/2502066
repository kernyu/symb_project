Mechanisms of resistance to quinolones were characterized in Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains isolated after Tn5 insertional mutagenesis and in resistant strains that emerged during pefloxacin therapy of experimental aortic endocarditis. Quinolone resistance achieved in in vitro-selected mutants Qr-1 and Qr-2 was associated with cross-resistance to several groups of antimicrobial agents, including beta-lactams, tetracycline, and chloramphenicol. A significant reduction of norfloxacin uptake was also observed. After ether permeabilization of the cells, DNA synthesis of these two isolates was as susceptible to norfloxacin as DNA synthesis of the parent strain (PAO1). These results indicate that alteration of outer membrane permeability is the primary determinant of resistance in these isolates. This altered cell permeability was correlated with reduction of outer membrane protein G (25.5 kilodaltons) and loss of a 40-kilodalton outer membrane protein in strain Qr-1. Resistance to quinolones that emerged during experimental endocarditis therapy was associated with both modification of outer membrane permeability (decreased uptake of norfloxacin) and decreased susceptibility of DNA synthesis to norfloxacin. Resistance was limited to quinolones and chloramphenicol. For these strains, norfloxacin inhibitory doses (50%) for DNA synthesis were identical to the drug MICs, suggesting that despite the identification of a permeability change, perhaps due to changes of lipopolysaccharide, the alteration of the quinolone intracellular target(s) susceptibility constitutes the primary determinant of resistance. Also, two distinct levels of norfloxacin resistance of DNA synthesis were found in these isolates, indicating that at least two distinct alterations of the drug target(s) are possible in P. aeruginosa.
