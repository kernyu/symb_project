407 strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa form in-patients and out-patients were serotyped according to Habs' schema. 11.3% of the isolates were non-typable and among the other strains serotypes 6 and 10 were the most prevalent (20.4 and 14.0%, respectively). Type 14 was not observed. Most of the strains isolated from sputum were non-typable, whereas serotype 6 predominated in specimens from urine, wounds and ears. The susceptibility of the isolates to antipseudomonal agents was estimated: 4.7% of the isolates (mainly serotypes 2, 4, and 11) were resistant to gentamicin and among these strains parallel resistance to tobramycin and netilmicin was observed in 47.4%.
