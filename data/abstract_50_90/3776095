Edwardsiella tarda isolates from the United States and Taiwan were screened against 37 antimicrobial agents. These isolates were highly susceptible to the amino-glycosides, second and third generation cephalosporins, newer penicillins, nitrofurantoin, sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, and the quinolones. Source-related resistance was found for penicillin G, sulfadiazine, colistin, novobiocin, spectinomycin, ampicillin, tetracycline, and chloramphenicol. Generally, the Taiwan isolates were more resistant than the United States isolates.
