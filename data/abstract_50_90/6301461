DNA gyrase (Topoisomerase II) has been purified from Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain PAO. This enzyme is inhibited by novobiocin and nalidixic acid. DNA gyrase from P. aeruginosa is resistant to a much higher level of nalidixic acid than is Escherichia coli DNA gyrase. This increased level of resistance may explain, at least in part, the higher levels of natural resistance exhibited by P. aeruginosa toward nalidixic acid.
