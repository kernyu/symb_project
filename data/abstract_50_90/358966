A spontaneous mutant of Escherichia coli (strain AB2847), selected for resistance to the aminoglycoside antibiotic neamine, shows severe restriction of amber suppressors in vivo. Ribosomes isolated from the mutant exhibit only low misreading in vitro in the presence of the antibiotic. Genetic and biochemical analyses indicate that the neamine-resistant phenotype is the result of two distinct mutations. The first, res3128, appears to affect the gene (strA) coding for the ribosomal protein S12. Although it leads to a restrictive phenotype it does not, however, confer resistance to streptomycin. The second mutation, X3128, is located between the sirA and AROB loci and is lethal when segregated from the res3128 mutation. It may affect the ribosome at the level of a post-translational modification.
