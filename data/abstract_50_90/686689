A biological method was used in addition to the chemical methods of identification in the screening programme of new antibiotics. The method consists of evaluation of the effect of the crude antibiotic preparations on microbial forms resistant to various antibiotics. The efficiency of the biological method is shown. It provides more complete and rapid characterization of the properties of the new antibiotics and their rough identification at early screening stages.
