As useful antibiotics for biliary tract infections, smooth transmigration to lesion and potent antibacterial activities will be demanded. Usually the antibiotics having potent antibacterial activities against E. coli and Klebsiella, which are considered to be main causative organisms of biliary tract infections, will be used for treatment. The concentrations of cefotiam (CTM) in bile and gallbladder wall tissue were investigated, and CTM showed very high concentrations in these tissues for several hours. And very good correlation between concentration of CTM in bile and laboratory findings, especially ICG R15 value, was obtained. CTM showed also very potent antibacterial activities against E. coli and Klebsiella. These results suggest that CTM will be useful agent for the treatment of biliary tract infections.
