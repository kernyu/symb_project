A series of experiments were performed on mice and rats subjected to total decontamination by oral administration of 3 antibiotics: gentamicin, ristomycin and nystatin. The results of experiments are summarized. It was shown that under the conventional conditions the decontamination was effective, when the intervals between the experiments were 3-5 months. When the intervals were less or the experiments were performed in the same room without intervals, the efficacy of the decontamination markedly decreased or it was ineffective. The results are discussed from the standpoints of the necessity of observing definite requirements for performance of such procedures in hospitals and laboratories.
