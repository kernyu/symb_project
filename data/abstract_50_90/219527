Strict criteria were applied in the choice of the 130 patients with severe urinary infections included in the study: men or women over 65 years of age presenting with clinical signs and symptoms, a bacterial count greater than or equal to 10(6)/mm3, one type of germ found on urine culture. The results of an antibiogram showed the frequency with which each germ was involved and their sensitivity to antibiotics, more particularly gentamicin, minocyclin, sulphamethoxazole-trimethoprime, oxolinic acid. Based on sensitivity and tolerance criteria, the choice of antibiotic was : oxolinic acid orally ; gentamicin parenterally, after evaluation of renal function. These results can assist the physician, when confronted with cases of severe urinary infection, and before the results of the antibiogram are available, in choosing effective therapy adapted to each case.
