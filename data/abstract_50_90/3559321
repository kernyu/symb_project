Hitherto, the selection of anticancer drug has been based on clinical experience. But to succeed for chemotherapy to succeed, effective drugs must be selected for individual patients with cancer. We have developed the following new in vitro micromethod. Method. In brief, tumor cells obtained by surgery were incubated with anticancer drugs for 48 hrs at 37 degrees C in 5% CO2 in a microplate. After incubation, the surviving cells were fixed with methanol and stained with crystal violet. Then the stained cells were solubilized with 1% lauryl sulfate and the absorbance of each well was measured at 540 nm with a multiscan spectrophotometer. In this method, cytotoxicity was quantitated by the absorbance. The method is simple, rapid (48 hrs) and reproducible, and it requires only a small amount of cells (5 X 10(3) approximately 1 X 10(4]. This method correlates well with sensitivity tests using isotopes. We have examined the chemosensitivity of 22 specimens from gynecologic malignancies by this method. The success rate is 77% and higher than with any other in vitro method. This method will be widely utilized in several fields of cancer treatment in the near future.
