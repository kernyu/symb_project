A survey was conducted to determine the prevalence of benzimidazole (BZ)-resistant small strongyles in horses in a southeastern Pennsylvania practice. Resistant parasites were found in 291 of 342 horses surveyed. Anthelmintic practices and pasture management factors in use for 3 to 6 years did not correlate with the presence of resistant small strongyles. Benzimidazole-resistant small strongyles were recovered in horses that had been treated alternately with BZ and non-BZ products and in horses receiving BZ products as infrequently as twice a year. However, inasmuch as the horses may have been infected with resistant small strongyles before the various anthelmintic schedules were implemented, it was not possible to attribute BZ-resistance to any particular pattern of drug use. Fifty-one (14.9%) horses had BZ-susceptible small strongyles: these horses were on poor overall parasite control programs and had received BZ products no more than once a year. Benzimidazole-piperazine and non-BZ drugs were effective in herds infected with BZ-resistant small strongyles.
