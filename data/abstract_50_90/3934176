Cultured cells of the higher plant Corydalis sempervirens Pers. which had been adapted to growing in the presence of 5 mM glyphosate (N-[phosphonomethyl]-glycine), a herbicide and a potent specific inhibitor of the shikimate pathway enzyme 5-enol-pyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate (EPSP) synthase, had a nearly 40-fold increased level of the extractable activity of EPSP synthase. Activities of five other shikimate pathway enzymes were, however, similar in the adapted and nonadapted cells, and the concentrations of the free aromatic amino acids in the two cell lines were also similar. EPSP synthases purified from glyphosate-adapted, as well as nonadapted cells, had identical physical, kinetic, and immunological properties, which indicated that the glyphosate-sensitive enzyme was overproduced in the adapted culture. Overproduction of EPSP synthase in the adapted culture was unequivocally established by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, as well as by one-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-gradient gel electrophoresis and quantitation of EPSP protein by immunoassay after transfer to nitrocellulose membranes. While about 0.06% of the total soluble protein from nonadapted cells was EPSP synthase protein, the proportion was 2.6% in the adapted cells. In vivo pulse-labeling experiments with [35S]methionine established that the adapted cells have an increased rate of EPSP synthase protein synthesis.
