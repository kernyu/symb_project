It is often difficult to test the role of T lymphocytes in resistance to infection because most models of T cell deficiency are associated with altered nonspecific resistance. In an attempt to address this problem, we compared the effects of cyclosporin A (CyA), cortisone (CA), and the athymic state on the course of murine listeriosis. We chose listeriosis because resistance to Listeria monocytogenes occurs in two phases. Bacterial multiplication is controlled by nonspecific defense mechanisms in the early phase and by acquired T cell-dependent immunity in the second phase. Mice treated with CA died during the early phase, probably because of inhibition of the antimicrobial activity of nonimmune macrophages. Accordingly, the immunosuppressive effect of CA was similar in athymic and normal mice. Untreated nude mice developed chronic low grade infection, probably because of heightened activity of nonimmune macrophages. In contrast, immunosuppression with CyA did not affect early resistance but induced overwhelming, fatal disease in the later phase when control mice began to acquire resistance. CyA did not change the course of listeriosis in nude mice, confirming its specificity for T cell-dependent immunity. Thus, this study shows that CyA is a potent and specific inhibitor of T cell-mediated immunity and that T cell-dependent resistance is essential for survival from listeriosis, a conclusion that could not have been established by studies of the nude mouse or immunosuppression by CA.
