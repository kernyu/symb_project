We have used oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis to make a specific change in the beta-lactamase (EC 3.5.2.6) (ampicillin resistance) gene of the plasmid pBR322. Evidence suggests that the active site for this enzyme may include a serine-threonine dyad (residues 70 and 71). By priming in vitro DNA synthesis with a chemically synthesized 16-base oligodeoxyribonucleotide, we have inverted the Ser-Thr dyad to Thr-Ser and thereby generated a mutant with an ampicillin-sensitive phenotype. This "double-mismatch" method is relatively simple and also very general because detection of mutants is at the level of DNA and involves only colony hybridization. Accordingly, the procedure can be applied to any DNA sequence and does not depend on the phenotype of the mutant.
