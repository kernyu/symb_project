Sixty-nine human oocytes were subjected to various parthenogenetic stimuli but no activation was observed. Analysis of Feulgen-stained DNA (F-DNA) distribution and content showed anomalies of chromosomal material in 36% of oocytes at 24-75 h after retrieval. A significant loss of F-DNA was noticed in apparently normal metaphase II oocytes remaining in culture for 2-3 days.
