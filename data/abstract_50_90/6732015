Twenty coccidia-free Holstein bull calves were allotted to groups to study effects of treatment with lasalocid and decoquinate on subsequent resistance to coccidiosis (Eimeria spp infections). Calves fed medicated rations of either drug at dosages of 50 mg/kg of feed (approx 1.2 mg/kg of body weight) had significantly fewer oocysts (P less than 0.01) than did nontreated controls regardless of other procedures used. Treated calves premunized with 2,000 oocysts/day for 5 days and later challenge inoculated with 200,000 oocysts did not develop diarrhea, unless the drugs were withdrawn from feed. Animals premunized (2,000 oocysts/day for 5 days) in absence of drug were no more resistant to the challenge inoculation than nonpremunized animals. These results indicated that lasalocid and decoquinate were efficacious coccidiostats and protected calves as long as they were administered. Cessation of drug treatment usually resulted in appearance of oocysts in feces and diarrhea. Premunization alone cannot be expected to prevent coccidiosis when animals are exposed to large numbers of oocysts.
