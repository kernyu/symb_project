The aim of this study was to evaluate the in vitro activity of several new microbial agents against 96 Acinetobacter calcoaceticus isolates. Among several new beta-lactams, imipenem, a new, broad-spectrum, highly potent penem, was the most active drug in vitro against these strains, with a geometric mean MIC of about 0.3 mg/l. Ceftazidime and ceftizoxime also demonstrated good in vitro activity with geometric mean MICs of 6 mg/l and 7 mg/l respectively. Among new quinolones, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin and pefloxacin were substantially active in vitro: geometric means were 0.8, 0.9 and 1.5 mg/l respectively. A progressive increase in resistance to aminoglycosides has been observed and 80 to 90% of isolates were resistant to all but amikacin, tobramycin and habekacin, which showed geometric mean MICs of 7.0, 6.0 and 1.2 mg/l.
