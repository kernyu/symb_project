The gene for the neomycin phosphotransferase II (NPT II) from transposon Tn5 was fused at the amino or carboxy terminus to foreign DNA sequences coding for 3-300 amino acids and the properties of the fused proteins were investigated. All amino-terminal fusions examined conferred kanamycin resistance to their host cell, but profound differences in their enzymatic activity and stability were detected. Short additions to the amino terminus of the NPT II resulted in highly enzymatically active fusion proteins whereas long amino-terminal fusions often had to be proteolytically degraded to release active proteins. Fusions at the carboxy-terminal end of the NPT II protein did not always induce kanamycin resistance and their enzymatic activity depended more stringently on the nature of the junction sequence.
