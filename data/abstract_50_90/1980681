Following the diagnosis of Acanthamoeba keratitis in a contact lens wearer, the antimicrobial susceptibility of the clinical isolate and the environmental source of the infection were investigated. Contrary to previous reports, in vitro antimicrobial testing showed that the infecting strain was inherently resistant to propamidine isethionate. Restriction endonuclease digestion analysis of Acanthamoeba whole-cell DNA of strains isolated from the patient's cornea, contact lens storage container, saline rinsing solution, and kitchen cold-water tap showed that the isolates were identical. This implicates, for the first time, domestic tap water as the source of Acanthamoeba sp. in this infection. It is therefore recommended that the use of homemade saline solutions and the rinsing of contact lenses in tap water be strongly discouraged.
