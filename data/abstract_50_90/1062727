A survey of patients presenting for primary treatment of infected lesions on their hands was carried out. Eight-nine lesions were cultured from which 116 organisms were isolated. The main organisms were coagulase-positive staphylococci. In 24 cases these were acting in concert with group A beta-haemolytic streptococci. Of the coagulase-positive staphylococci isolated, 19 percent were resistant to sulphonamides, and only 45 percent were resistant to penicillin.
