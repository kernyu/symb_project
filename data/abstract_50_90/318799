The mode of action, bacterial resistance, in vitro activity, pharmacology, dosage, adverse reactions, interactions and indications for tetracyclines are reviewed. Suggestions for the selection of a particular tetracycline are provided. It is concluded that there is only one pertinent difference among the tetracyclines, namely, that doxycycline, and probably minocycline, can be given in full dosage and with minimal risk to patients with renal impairment.
