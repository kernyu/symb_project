The pattern of antimicrobial resistance of common bacterial isolates obtained from various groups of patients at a large tertiary-care center was compared with the pattern of resistance seen at a primary-care community hospital. At the tertiary-care center, significant differences in susceptibility were seen between pediatric and adult groups. In the tertiary-care center, the inpatients were more likely than the outpatients to have resistant staphylococcal and enterobacterial strains. Comparison of the overall resistance at the tertiary-care center and the primary-care hospital showed that resistance to cephalosporins, piperacillin, and aminoglycosides was significantly higher at the tertiary-care hospital than at the community hospital. Striking differences were noted in the resistance of nosocomial Enterobacter and Citrobacter isolates. Hospitals should be cautious in extrapolating nationwide data to their particular institutions.
