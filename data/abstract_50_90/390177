Cefuroxime, a new cephalosporin C antibiotic, was administered to 15 children with respiratory tract infection, urinary tract infection, or subcutaneous tumour. The following results were obtained. 1) CXM 30 approximately 100 mg/kg/day were used in treatment of respiratory tract infection. Eight of the eleven patients treated responded to the therapy. 2) CXM 45 approximately 75 mg/kg/day were given to 3 patients with urinary tract infection. Excellent results were obtained in all these cases. 3) One patient with subcutaneous tumour responded to CXM therapy. 4) Clinical isolates from the foci involved, i.e., Staphylococcus aureus (4 strains), Group A Streptococcus hemolyticus (1 strain), Streptococcus pneumoniae (1 strain), Haemophilus influenzae (1 strain), and Escherichia coli (3 strains) were all eliminated by CXM therapy except 2 unassessable strains. 5) No noteworthy side effect was noted.
