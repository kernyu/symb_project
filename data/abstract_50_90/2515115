Bacteriophage M2 encodes its own DNA polymerase which catalyses the formation of a primer protein-5'dAMP initiation complex for DNA replication. To understand the relation of structure to function of this 'protein-priming DNA polymerase', we have determined the nucleotide sequence of the M2 DNA polymerase-encoding gene (gene G). The deduced 572-amino acid sequence of M2 DNA polymerase shows 82.3% overall homology to that of phi 29 DNA polymerase. A homology search with the mutation data matrix revealed that six segments (A-F, from the N terminus) of M2 and phi 29 DNA polymerases are homologous with the sequence of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I (PolI). Segments D and F coincide with the conserved segments of many other DNA polymerases. Therefore, M2 and phi 29 DNA polymerases have structural features, at least in the conserved segments, similar to those of PolI and other DNA polymerases. Based on the homology with PolI and the location of the mutations for aphidicolin resistance and nucleoside analog resistance of M2, phi 29 and herpes simplex virus type-1 DNA polymerases, we propose that segments A-D of the M2 and phi 29 DNA polymerases constitute a structure which forms the cleft for holding template DNA and that segment D is a region for interacting with dNTP.
