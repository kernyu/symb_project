Staphylococcus aureus strain S-6, which produces enterotoxin type B (SEB), and strain 10-275, a high toxin-producing mutant derived from S-6, display pronounced differences in dye sensitivity, osmotic stability, and bacitracin sensitivity. Such characteristics are consistent with the concept that strain 10-275 is a membrane mutant of strain S-6. Some membrane mutants of S. aureus strain 14458 exhibit about two- to three-fold increases in SEB production whereas other membrane mutants show about twofold increases in alpha-hemolysin production. It is suggested that specific and independent membrane mutations control the secretory processes resulting in the extracellular elaboration of these exoproteins.
