Daptomycin, vancomycin, ampicillin and aminoglycosides, alone or in combination, were tested for their bactericidal activity against 15 isolates of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium from immunocompromised children. The kill-kinetic studies at clinically achievable concentrations demonstrated that daptomycin alone or in combination with ampicillin had the greatest bactericidal activity.
