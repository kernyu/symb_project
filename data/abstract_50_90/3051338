There has been no decrease in the number of cases of malaria brought into Switzerland. 841 cases were reported to the Federal Office of Public Health between 1982 and 1986, a figure probably below the actual number of cases. Reports were received from all cantons and the majority involve Swiss travellers. 54% of the cases were due to P. falciparum and 90% of these could be traced to a stay in tropical or subtropical Africa, particularly Kenya, where it was possible to determine the attack rate and to compare it with the risk in Thailand. An enquiry into prophylaxis disclosed how slowly the latest recommendations on preventive measures against malaria are being adopted, and the importance of keeping a close watch on regions where resistance or multiresistance has developed. Systematic reporting is essential to control and also permits the recommendation of appropriate preventive measures.
