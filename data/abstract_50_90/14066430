Gundersen, Wenche B. (Oslo University, Oslo, Norway). New type of streptomycin resistance resulting from action of the episomelike mutator factor in Escherichia coli. J. Bacteriol. 86:510-516. 1963.-Analyses have been performed to elucidate the genetic nature of the streptomycin resistance that results from the action of the previously described episomelike mutator factor in Escherichia coli. This streptomycin resistance has been found to differ from ordinary one-step streptomycin resistance. The new type of streptomycin resistance, "mutator resistance," can be lost, either spontaneously or by treatment with ultraviolet light and acriflavine. It is more stable in a K-12 strain than in the original E. coli strain 635. Mutator resistance segregates like a chromosomal marker in genetic crosses, and is located near the ordinary streptomycin locus. The locus for mutator resistance is distinct from that of ordinary streptomycin resistance, apparently located further toward the threonine region. Mutator resistance, unlike ordinary one-step streptomycin resistance, appears as a dominant character. The possibilities of its being a suppressor or regulator mutation are discussed.
