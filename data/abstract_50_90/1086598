Selected antibiotic advertisements in medical journals are discussed to illustrate the misleading information that is often disseminated to physicians by the pharmaceutical industry. Laboratory and clinical data are presented to question the validity of selected advertisements which (1) encourage the use of Keflex for severe respiratory infections in children, (2) recommend the use of Keflex for the treatment of bacterial bronchitis, (3) suggest that high tissue penetration is a unique property of Vibramycin, (4) present pooled susceptability data which do not reflect microbial resistance patterns in the patient's hospital, (5) recommend twice-daily administration of Ancef for urinary tract infections but do not clearly state the potential danger of this regimen for other infections, (6) suggest that gentamicin should be given to adults in only two dosage sizes for the treatment of serious Gram-negative infections, and (7) lead the reader to assume that only women need to be treated for Trichomonas infections. It is suggested that as antibiotics are marketed, hospital therapeutics committees should evaluate their advantages and permit formulary additions for only those agents demonstrating increased efficacy, decreased toxicity or decreased cost. Pharmacists who monitor drug therapy can provide information to the physician which will increase his awareness of optimal antibiotic therapy.
