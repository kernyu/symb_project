The effect of pretreatment with benzylpenicillin, tetracycline hydrochloride and streptomycin sulfate on the course of either anesthesia was studied in experiments on animals. Benzylpenicillin and tetracyclin hydrochloride neither significantly changed the reactivity of the mouse body nor affected the course of ether anesthesia. Administration of streptomycin sulfate to mice and dogs was attended by the reduced function of the central nervous system. The course of ether anesthesia changed accordingly. The reaction of the animals who had been pretreated with streptomycin sulfate was determined by the species features. In white mice, the antibiotic increased the resistance to the toxic effect of ether while in the dogs, it decreased, on the contrary, the body resistance under anesthesia, thereby accelerating the animals' death.
