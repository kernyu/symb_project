The in-vitro activity of 25 antimicrobial agents against 113 to 161 clinical isolates of Campylobacter jejuni was tested by an agar dilution method. All strains were susceptible to the four aminoglycosides tested, to imipenem, chloramphenicol and norfloxacin. One strain (0.6%) was resistant to each of the following antibiotics: nalidixic acid, erythromycin and clindamycin. The frequency of tetracycline, metronidazole and cotrimoxazole resistance among our isolates was 14.5%, 56.4% and 96% respectively. In general, the beta-lactam antibiotics (penicillins and cephalosporins) showed only moderate to poor activity against C. jejuni. Of 159 strains tested, 89.3% produced beta-lactamases.
