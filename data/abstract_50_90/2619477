Investigations were conducted on 36 mycoplasma isolates to elucidate their resistance behaviours to kanamycin, gentamycin, neomycin, tylosin, oxytetracycline, chloramphenicol, and tiamulin. Only the latter proved to be highly effective, whereas all 36 strains were absolutely resistant to kanamycin, gentamycin, and neomycin, while 16 strains were resistant to all of the above antibiotics but tiamulin. Comparison of resistograms was found to provide some limited way of comparing strains and possibilities for detection of sources of contamination. Tiamulin may be used for improvement of cell cultures on account of its good cellular compatibility and high effectiveness on mycoplasmas.
