The advantages of a single-agent regimen for prevention or treatment of female pelvic infections are outlined, and the characteristics of an "ideal" single agent are described. Indications for antimicrobial use in obstetrics and gynecology as well as the pathogens most likely to cause infection are reviewed. Empirical treatment regimens are assessed not only for efficacy but also for safety, simplicity, cost, and potential for inducing bacterial resistance. Piperacillin, as an example of an antimicrobial that may be appropriate for single-agent use in female pelvic infections, is evaluated in depth.
