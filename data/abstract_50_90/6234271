The results of clinical trials in which norfloxacin was used for 7 days compared with amoxycillin or cotrimoxazole, or for 3 days compared with citrated nalidixic acid, are presented. Additionally, the results of a concurrent open study of 3 days of norfloxacin in the management of simple urinary tract infections are discussed. Resistance to norfloxacin was only encountered in 0.2% of pathogens isolated. Norfloxacin was as effective in eradicating bacteriuria as amoxycillin, cotrimoxazole or citrated nalidixic acid. The response to 3 days of norfloxacin was similar to that seen after 7 days therapy with this compound, or to 7 days of cotrimoxazole. The incidence of adverse experiences to norfloxacin in 758 patients was below 10%.
