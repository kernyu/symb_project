Polymyxin-resistant pmrA mutants of Salmonella typhimurium differed from their parents in that they were resistant to tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane-ethylenediaminetetraacetate-lysozyme, tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane-ethylenediaminetetraacetate-deoxycholate, and tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane-ethylenediaminetetraacetate-bacitracin. Tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane-ethylenediaminetetraacetate released about 50% less lipopolysaccharide from the pmrA strains than from the parental strains when the bacteria were grown in L-broth containing 2 mM Ca2+. Protamine, polylysine, octapeptin, benzalkonium chloride, cold NaCl, cold MgCl2, or cold tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane hydrochloride (pH 7.2) caused no leakage or markedly less leakage of periplasmic beta-lactamase from a pmrA mutant than from its parent strain. pmrA mutants were more resistant than their parent strains to protamine and polylysine but not to octapeptin or benzalkonium chloride, as measured by the ability of these agents to kill the bacteria or to sensitize them to deoxycholate-induced lysis. The pmrA strains did not differ from their parent strains in sensitivity to several antibiotics, in porin function (as measured by cephaloridine diffusion across the outer membrane), or in outer membrane-associated phospholipase A activity.
