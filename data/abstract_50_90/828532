A survey of the meningococcal carrier rate was conducted in the Nsukka area (eastern Nigeria) during an interepidemic period. It was found that approximately 10% of 1126 individuals studied carried one serogroup or other. The predominant serogroup was B (58.1%), followed by C (24.2%). The highest percentage of isolates was from the age group 11-20 years (12.00%), followed by the age group 6-10 years (10.5%). The proportion of isolations was only 6.0% in the age group 31 years and above. Isolates from urban communities were resistant to sulfadiazine: 71.43% (group A), 63.9% (group B), 80.0% (group C), and 100% (group D). The percentage of resistant isolates from the villages was lower. Ninety-five per cent of all isolates were sensitive to penicillin, streptomycin, chloramphenicol, trimethoprim, and erythromycin.
