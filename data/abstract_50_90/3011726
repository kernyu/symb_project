New quinolones are very potent compounds against Gram-negative bacteria, including Pseudomonas, and staphylococci. They are particularly interesting because of their oral availability and their pharmacokinetic properties. When combined with other common antibiotics they appear to have mostly indifferent effects in vitro. Clinical results have shown their efficacy when used alone for the treatment of osteomyelitis, complicated urinary tract infections and prostatitis. Nevertheless, in 6% of cases resistant strains were selected (Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Serratia, P. aeruginosa and staphylococci). The use of combinations of quinolones with other antibiotics was successful in the treatment of osteomyelitis and severe nosocomial infections including bacteraemia, and seems to prevent emergence of resistant strains.
