Fifteen male outpatients with uncomplicated gonococcal urethritis were treated by a single oral dose of norfloxacin (800 mg). Fourteen patients completely recovered from infection and a recurrence was noted in only one. Five of the Neisseria gonorrhoeae isolated (33.3%) were penicillin-resistant. However, the extremely low MICs confirm that norfloxacin possesses high antibacterial activity against N. gonorrhoeae. Norfloxacin was well tolerated with only a transient nausea occurring in four patients.
