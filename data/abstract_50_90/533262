The susceptibility of 11,840 clinical bacterial isolates to fortimicin A was determined by agar dilution or broth microdilution methods and compared with their susceptibility to amikacin and gentamicin. In general, the in vitro activity of fortimicin A was essentially the same as that of amikacin. Significant exceptions were the increased effectiveness of fortimicin A against Serratia marcescens and the greater activity of amikacin against Pseudomonas and other nonfermentative gram-negative bacilli. On a weight-for-weight basis, gentamicin showed greater activity than the other two antimicrobial drugs against most species; S. Marcescens was the major exception. However, at concentrations equivalent to achievable nontoxic serum levels, the proportion of isolates inhibited by the three drugs was quite comparable. There were several strains with unusually high resistance to one or more of the tested antibiotics. These usually occurred in one of the six participating institutions and could be traced to specific enzyme-producing or permeability mutants endemic to that particular institution.
