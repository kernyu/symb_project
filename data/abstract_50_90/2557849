An intrinsic protective mechanism against cell injury seems to exist in cultured gastric mucosal cells. Cells, isolated from the stomachs of 10- to 12-day-old rats and subcultured, were examined for damage by the erythrosine B dye exclusion test. Pretreatment with 5 microM A23187 (a calcium ionophore) diminished the cell damage induced by acidified medium (pH 3.5) or 8 mM aspirin (pH 5.0). The effect of A23187 appeared 4 hr after its addition and was reversible. Protection by A23187 against cell injury diminished in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ and was dependent on Ca2+ concentration. An increase in intracellular Ca2+ may induce cell resistance against injury in cultured gastric mucosal cells.
