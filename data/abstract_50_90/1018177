Virazole or Ribavirin (1-beta-D-ribofuranosyl-1,2,4-triazole-3-carboxamide) inhibits the growth of vaccinia virus at a concentration ode to a certain extent in the presence of Virazole, the DNA fails to acquire resistance to deoxyribonuclease and virus particles are not formed. Reversibility of the antiviral effect occurs when the drug is washed out from the infected cultures or when guanosine at an equimolar concentration is added.
