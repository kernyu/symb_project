By transformation analysis, a mutation (crsE1), which makes Bacillus subtilis cells able to sporulate in the presence of relatively high concentrations of glucose and other carbon sources, was mapped in the rpoBC operon. The effect of crsE1 mutation can be suppressed by another mutation in the same operon, rfm11, which confers resistance to rifamycin. Mutants carrying stv or std mutations, which are also located in the rpoBC operon, showed partial resistance to catabolites in sporulation. It appears therefore that a change in the structure or synthesis of RNA polymerase may alter the response of cells to the inhibitory effect of catabolites on sporulation.
