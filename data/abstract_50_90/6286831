A bacterial gene (neo) conferring resistance to neomycin-kanamycin antibiotics has been inserted into SV40 hybrid plasmid vectors and introduced into cultured mammalian cells by DNA transfusion. Whereas normal cells are killed by the antibiotic G418, those that acquire and express neo continue to grow in the presence of G418. In the course of the selection, neo DNA becomes associated with high molecular weight cellular DNA and is retained even when cells are grown in the absence of G418 for extended periods. Since neo provides a marker for dominant selections, cell transformation to G418 resistance is an efficient means for cotransformation of nonselected genes.
