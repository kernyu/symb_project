Study of the incidence of Klebsiella aerogenes strains in neonates and infants with acute enterocolitis in the Maternity and Pediatric Departments gave the following results: - bacteriologic investigations were carried out in 1831 subjects, isolating 138 Klebsiella aerogenes strains; - the proportion of Klebsiella isolations increased from 4.6% in 1973 to 11.1% in 1974; - the maximum receptivity to Klebsiella aerogenes was noted in the 0-2 years age group, in a proportion of 23%; - in the 0-6 months age group Klebsiella aerogenes was the evident causal agent of enterocolitis, being isolated in pure cultures or as predominant germ in 70-80% of the cases. Worthy of note was the increased resistance to antibiotics in terms of the rising age-group scale. The predominance of a single serotype (K 15), the similar sensitivity of the strains to phage 32 and to antibiotics plead for an epidemic evolution of the cases studied.
