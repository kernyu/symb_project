The susceptibility of 635 clinical isolates of bacteria to cefoxitin was determined. Isolates from the urinary tract showed 97% sensitivity, isolates from infected wounds showed 93% sensitivity and 82% of blood culture isolates were sensitive. Streptococcus faecalis isolates showed only 50% sensitivity and pseudomonas organisms were predominantly resistant. Bacteria isolated from unprepared heart valves submitted for use as homografts showed only 71% sensitivity due to the large proportion of Streptococcus and Pseudomonas species isolated.
