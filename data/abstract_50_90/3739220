Studied were a total of 125 Salmonella strains, isolated from birds, with regard to their sensitivity to medicinal drugs. A 100 percent effect against these organisms was found with amopen, neomycin, borgal, and sumetrolin. The effect was 97.7 per cent with canamycin, gentamycin, and terramycin; it was 95.5 per cent with the use of streptomycin, spectam, and chloramphenicol, 72.4 per cent--with tetracyclin, 70.5 per cent--with nalidixic acid, and 47.7 per cent--with sulfathiazol. Resistance of the strains to carbenicillin was 83 per cent, to ampicillin--79.6 per cent, and to sulfathiazol--38.6 per cent. It was interesting to note that resistance to carbenicillin and nalidixic acid, used in human medicine only, was 82.6 and 4.54 per cent, respectively. The high susceptibility of Salmonellae to amopen, and the limited capacity of the organisms to produce resistant strains outline the perspective of its wide use in the control of Salmonella infections in birds.
