Six UV induced cycloheximide-sensitive revertants were isolated from the cyh1-C7 strain of Schizosaccharomyces pombe which is resistant to cycloheximide. In all cases reversion to sensitivity was due to a forward mutation in a second suppressor gene. Genetical analysis showed that at least two genes, designated scr1 and scr2 (scr=suppression of cycloheximide resistance) were involved. Both scr1 and scr2 suppressed the resistance of six independently isolated alleles at the cyh1 locus. They had no effect on two known nonsense mutations in the ade7 locus. The cyh1-C7 strain has an altered 60S ribosomal protein which can be detected by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. In two suppressed strains, cyh1-C7 scr1 and cyh1-C7 scr2, the original altered protein was present. However no further ribosomal protein differences were observed which could be correlated with the presence of the scr genes. Both scr mutations conferred cold sensitivity on the organism indicating that they were of the missense type. Hence it seems certain that scr1 and scr2 are not mutations in tRNA genes leading to either nonsense or missense suppression. There is however no direct evidence that they code for ribosomal proteins and exert their effect on cyh1-C7 at the ribosomal level.
