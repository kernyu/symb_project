The presence of an additional penicillin-binding protein (PBP) was demonstrated in methicillin-resistant strains of Staphylococcus epidermidis, S. haemolyticus, S. hominis, and S. simulans. In these four species, the apparent molecular mass of this protein was analogous to that of PBP 2' of methicillin-resistant S. aureus SR 1550-9. It exhibited a low affinity for methicillin, cephalothin, and cefamandole; and its synthesis was methicillin inducible. Peptide mapping of this PBP from the four species yielded identical results that were analogous to those obtained with S. aureus SR 1550-9. These results suggest that this protein is similar to, if not the same as, PBP 2' of S. aureus and that it is involved in methicillin resistance in the four species studied.
