The effects of loop diuretics on the endocochlear direct current (DC) potential and the effective electrical resistance of the cochlear partition were studied. The effective electrical resistance was increased, and the endocohlear DC potential was decreased. The decrease in the endocohlear DC potential must not be caused by breaks in the electrical insulation of the cochlear partition. With loop diuretics the endocochlear DC potential decreased less in guinea pigs treated with kanamycin sulfate than it did in the control group. Two interpretations of these phenomena are presented.
