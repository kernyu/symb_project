The author studied 121 strains of Yersinia enterocolitica isolated in the Ptimorye Territory. It was found that by their sensitivity to antibiotics the strains did not differ from the analogues abroad strains: they were highly sensitive to tetracycline, streptomycin, kanamycin, neomycin and monomycin (MIC 1.25 to 0.6 gamma/ml or units/ml), less sensitive to oxytetracycline, chlortetracycline, levomycetin, oletetrine and gramicidine (MIC 10-5 gamma/ml), highly resistant to penicillin (MIC 100-50 gamma/ml), erythromycin and polymyxin (MIC 500-100 gamma/ml). No differences in the sensitivity to the above antibiotics of the Far East strains as dependent on the place period and source of isolation and inidentity of their biochemical characteristics were found. Cross resistance in Yersinia enterocolitica forms with artificially developed resistance to some antibiotics was found. No cross resistance with tetracycline was noted in the streptomycin resistant variants of the bacteria.
