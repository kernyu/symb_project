A phase II study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of lomustine, cytarabine, mitoxantrone and prednisone (CAMP) chemotherapy in doxorubicin-resistant intermediate- and high-grade malignant non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL). Among 30 patients, the complete remission rate was 27% (duration: 10, 16, 22, 35, 35+, 42+, 51+, 55+ months) and the partial remission rate was 20%. Median survival for complete responders was more than 4 years. The best responses were seen in patients with relapsed NHL compared to those with primary refractory NHL. Toxicity was mainly related to myelosuppression. The results suggest that the CAMP schedule can be applied on an outpatient basis with satisfactory efficacy in patients with relapsing intermediate- and high-grade malignant NHL.
