Sensitivity of L-forms of group A streptococci to 5 antibiotics such as erythromycin, lincomycin, tetracycline, gentamicin and chloramphenicol was studied in an artificial nutrient medium and cell cultures i.e. human fibroblast diploid cells and transplantable human heart cells (Girardi). In vitro investigation of the antibiotic effect on the streptococcal L-forms revealed their sensitivity to erythromycin (MIC, 0.4 micrograms/ml), lincomycin (MIC, 0.08 microgram/ml) and tetracycline (MIC, 2 micrograms/ml). The streptococcal L-forms were slightly sensitive to gentamicin (MIC, 6 micrograms/ml) and chloramphenicol (MIC, 30 micrograms/ml). Complete inhibition of the growth of the L-forms in the Girardi cells on the 1st day of the experiment after the antibiotics administration in single doses was induced by lincomycin, 5 micrograms/ml, erythromycin, 10 micrograms/ml, and tetracycline, 100 micrograms/ml. In the diploid cells, the respective figures were 50, 100 and 200 micrograms/ml. Chloramphenicol and gentamicin had an inhibitory effect on the growth of the L-forms but produced no sanative effect.
