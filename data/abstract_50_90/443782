Sensitivity of beta-hemolytic streptococci of group A, Streptococcus viridans, Staphylococcus aureus, epidermal staphylococci, pneumococci, Proteus and Ps. aeruginosa isolated in 1975-1978 from patients with tonsillitis, otitis, sinusitis and other otorhinolaryngological diseases was studied with respect to 19 antibiotics. Data on comparison of the antibiotic sensitivity of the microflora isolated from the patients with otorhinolaryngological diseases in 1964-1974 and 1975-1978 are presented. It was shown that beta-hemolytic streptococci were highly sensitive to all the antibiotics tested except tetracycline. Among Streptococcus viridans the strains resistant to many antibiotics were more frequent than among beta-hemolytic streptococci. Most of the Staphylococcus aureus strains were sensitive to gentamycin, cephaloridin, oxacillin and resistant to the other antibiotics. The epidermal staphylococci were characterized by approximately the same antibiotic sensitivity as Staphylococcus aureus. Resistance of the predominating majority of the Pneumococcus strains to tetracycline was noted. Proteus and Ps. aeruginosa were resistant to all the antibiotics except aminoglycosides. The microflora isolated from the cases with otorhinolaryngological diseases in 1975-1978 were mainly characterized by lower antibiotic sensitivity than that isolated from the cases with the same diseases in 1964-1974. It is possible to suppose that the microorganisms isolated from the patients with otorhinolaringological diseases had no significant differences with respect to their antibiotic sensitivity from those isolated from the patients with other pathological processes.
