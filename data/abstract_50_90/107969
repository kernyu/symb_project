The effect of oxytetracycline and demethylchlortetracycline on aldosterone- and insulin-mediated Na+ transport (short-circuit current) were examined in toad urinary bladders mounted in modified Ussing chambers. Oxytetracycline had little or no effect on either basal or aldosterone-mediated Na+ transport. In contrast, demethylchlortetracycline markedly inhibited both basal and aldosterone-mediated Na+ transport. Furthermore, demethylchlortetracycline inhibited the aldosterone response significantly out of proportion to its effects on basal Na+ transport. Neither of the drugs had an effect on insulin-mediated Na+ transport. Consequently, the natriuresis observed in certain patients treated with demethylchlortetracyline may be related to drug-induced renal resistance to the effects of aldosterone.
