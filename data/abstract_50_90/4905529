Five Bedsonia (Chlamydia) isolates from lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) patients were tested for inclusion type, sulfonamide sensitivity, and mouse virulence. Two matched the classical description of LGV agents. Two were not virulent for mice by the intracerebral route, therefore fitting the description for trachoma-inclusion conjunctivitis agents. One was highly virulent for mice and sulfonamide-resistant, and produced inclusions that did not stain with iodine, all characteristics generally associated with avian bedsoniae. A sixth isolate could not be adequately tested due to poor infective yields. Because of this variety of properties within the Bedsonia group, the term LGV might more appropriately be reserved for clinical disease rather than to describe a particular bedsonial agent.
