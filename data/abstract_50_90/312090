12 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia remaining in remission for 1-3 years, were studied during levamisol therapy. T-lymphocytes count, phagocytic activity of granulocytes the adherent cell number were investigated. The clinical state of patients before, during and after levamisol treatment was evaluated. The increased resistance to infections after levamisol therapy was noted. The rise of T-lymphocyte and phagocyting granulocytes number was observed in 70% of patients after 6 weeks of therapy. At the same time the decrease of phagocytic index was found. No essential variations in adherent cells count were noted. The patients who did not respond to the levamisol treatment relapsed in 2-3 months.
