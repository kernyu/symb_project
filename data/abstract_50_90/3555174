Staphylococcus epidermidis is an organism formerly believed to be nonpathogenic. It is now recognized as a pathogen, causing infections on implanted devices and among immunosuppressed patients. Further, it has been involved in the development of resistance to a number of antibiotics. The epidemiology of this organism, its pathogenesis, and its treatment are important to infection control practitioners.
