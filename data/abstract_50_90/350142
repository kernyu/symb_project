The activity of enzymes, inactivating levomycetin and penicillin in the cells of plague and pseudotuberculosis microbes bearing extrachromosomal determinants resistant to a number of antibiotics was studied as dependent on some cultivation parameters: population age, aeration rate and temperature. It was shown that the highest capacity for levomycetin acetylation was characteristic of the cells in the late logarithmic and early stationary growth phages. Accumulation of levomycetin O-acetothers in the incubation medium markedly increased, when the cells were grown under the conditions of intensive aeration. An increase in the cultivation temperature up to 37 degrees C was accompanied by a reliable decrease in the activity of levomycetin acetylase in the transconjugant plague and pseudotuberculosis microbes though no correlation with the resistance levels in the same strains to the above antibiotics was observed. Optimal conditions for penicillinase production were determined. The maximum levels of penicillinase were found in the cells of Y. pestis 556/106 Rn with the episotic resistance type in the early exponential developmental phase under the aeration conditions and the temperature of 28 degrees C.
