A 15-month-old child developed an infectious pulmonary complication of open heart surgery. Cultures of the respiratory secretions showed growth of a 9L serotype of Streptococcus pneumoniae which was resistant to penicillin, tetracycline, and chloramphenicol. There was no evidence that the organism was spread among the family of the patient or hospital personnel.
