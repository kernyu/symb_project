We report a case of endocarditis associated with a highly gentamicin-resistant enterococcus that failed to respond to conventional antibiotic combination therapy. Clinical resolution was achieved following cardiac surgery and antimicrobial treatment dictated by in vitro testing of the patient's organism. Laboratories should test blood culture isolates of enterococci for high level gentamicin resistance. Management of such cases requires individual assessment and extensive laboratory investigation.
