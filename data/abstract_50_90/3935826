With the recent development of new potential antibiotics, it has become easier to treat patients with common bacterial infections. However, we find it difficult to handle severe infections due to opportunistic pathogens, developed in the so-called immunocompromised patients. SM-4300 is a newly developed intravenous human gamma-globulin, which is said to be intact without conventional enzyme-treatment and sulfonization. SM-4300 is also free from large molecules of aggregated gamma-globulin. SM-4300 was administered in combination with antibiotics to 2 patients of severe respiratory infections, having refractory underlying diseases. Case No. 1 was a 65-year-old female with bronchopneumonia, who had been suffering from pulmonary fibrosis, chronic bronchitis, chronic congestive heart failure and tricuspid insufficiency for several years. During her hospitalization because of these diseases, she developed cough with slight sputum and exertional dyspnea accompanied by high body temperature of 38 degrees C on January 1983. Chest X-ray revealed infiltration in the right lung field which was compatible with bronchopneumonia. SM-4300 of 5 g was added intravenously on 5th day after 4 day-cefotiam treatment with no improvement. High body temperature subsided and laboratory data became normal around 3 days after single SM-4300 injection. Case No. 2 was a 68-year-old male patient of chronic bronchitis with chronic pulmonary emphysema and bronchial asthma. Around the end of May 1983, he complained of dyspnea on exertion and had mucopurulent sputum, more than 100 ml daily, from which Pseudomonas aeruginosa was cultured in large number. He was afebrile.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
