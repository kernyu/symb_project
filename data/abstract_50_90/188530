Polyriboadenylic-polybouridylic acid enhanced the immunological response of guinea pigs to aqueous foot-and-mouth disease virus vaccine. Polyriboninosinic-polyribocytidylic acid enhanced the early antibody production of swine to oil emulsified foot-and-mouth disease virus vaccine. Polyriboninosinic-polyribocytidylic acid alone did not stimulate resistance to foot-and-mouth disease in swine.
