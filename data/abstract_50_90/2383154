Amikacin sensitivity of 157 strains which caused infectious inflammatory diseases in patients of a therapeutic hospital was studied. It was shown that 52 and 42.9% of the isolates from patients with bronchopulmonary infections were highly and moderately sensitive to amikacin, respectively. 5 pneumococcal strains were resistant to amikacin. Among the isolates from urine of the patients with urinary infections there were no strains resistant to amikacin. Study of amikacin pharmacokinetics demonstrated expediency of antibiotic endobronchial administration to patients with bronchopulmonary diseases and aggravation of chronic purulent inflammatory processes. A favourable clinical effect of amikacin after its intramuscular or endobronchial administration was observed in 53.3% of the patients. In 30% of the patients the effect was satisfactory. In 16.7% of the patients the treatment failed. Satisfactory antibiotic tolerance in the majority of the patients was stated.
