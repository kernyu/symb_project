Dynamic changes in the Escherichia coli population in the calf gut were studied over 21 days in a group of 18 intensively-reared market calves. Isolates were identified by O-serogrouping, biotyping and resistogram patterns. Seventy O-serogroups were identified among nearly 3000 E. coli isolates examined and these were subdivided into 416 strains by means of their biotype and resistogram. Seventy-five per cent of these strains were detected only once or twice, which points to the continual replacement of the E. coli flora with strains that showed low persistence in the gut. The rise in the frequency of antibiotic resistance observed during the study was not due to a change in the proportion of resistant to sensitive strains in the gut flora. It was a consequence of the displacement of the original flora by multiply-resistant strains, which presumably originated from the calves' environment.
