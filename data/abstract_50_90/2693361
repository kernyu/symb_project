According to available studies the experience with cefotaxime in the treatment of urinary tract infections (UTI) is presented. Because of its broad spectrum antibacterial activity cefotaxime is active against most of the causative organisms, including multiresistant strains (except enterococci). Of 400 isolates cultured from 400 urological inpatients with complicated and/or hospital acquired UTI 90.2% of the gram-negatives and 87.7% of the staphylococci were inhibited by concentrations of less than or equal to 8 mg/l. As with other antibiotics in uncomplicated UTI, high cure rates could be achieved by single dose or short-term treatment. According to six non-comparative and nine comparative studies it could be demonstrated that treatment with cefotaxime achieved favorable results in patients with complicated and hospital acquired UTI even if caused by multiresistant strains. In general, in these studies cefotaxime was superior to gentamicin, cefoxitin, cefazolin and cefuroxime, but as effective as other third generation cephalosporins and aztreonam and as the combination of ampicillin and netilmicin. A good tolerance of cefotaxime was reported in all studies.
