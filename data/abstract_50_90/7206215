The therapeutic efficacy of cefoxitin (CFX) in chronic respiratory tract infection was evaluated in patients who poorly responded to other antibiotics. To 20 patients, CFX was administered 2 g b.i.d. intravenously by drip infusion. Clinical efficacy was judged based on the criteria by score. 1. Bacterial elimination rate with CFX was 73.7%. 2. A clinical cure rate was 80.0% was obtained by doctors in charge. 3. According to the score assessment, the overall clinical effectiveness rate was 60.0%, clinical symptom cure rate was 85.0% and improvement rate of X-ray findings was 55.0%. 4. Usefulness rate which was assessed by clinical effect and side effect was 70.0%. 5. No side effects and abnormal laboratory findings were observed in this study. We used the new antibiotic CFX in patients with chronic respiratory tract infections who responded poorly to other antibiotics and obtained satisfactory results. Especially CFX indicated more effective possibility in cases from whom Gram-negative bacilli was isolated.
