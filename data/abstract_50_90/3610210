Two dermatophyte strains, Trichophyton quinckeanum and Trichophyton rubrum, were highly susceptible to in vitro killing by components of the H2O2-peroxidase-halide system. Both strains were, however, resistant to relatively high concentrations of reagent H2O2 or H2O2 enzymatically generated by glucose and glucose oxidase, KI, or lactoperoxidase (LPO) alone. Resistance to hydrogen peroxidase killing was found to be in part due to the presence of endogenous catalase in the fungi; susceptibility was increased by pretreatment of the fungi with a catalase inhibitor. Kinetic studies using small quantities of reagent or enzymatically generated H2O2 and LPO-KI showed that the system was lethal for both fungal strains within 1 min. Furthermore, using the glucose-glucose oxidase-LPO-KI system, it was shown that catalase, superoxide dismutase and histidine scavengers of H2O2, superoxide anion and singlet oxygen, respectively, prevented the killing of fungus, whereas scavengers of hydroxyl radicals such as benzoate and mannitol had no effect. T. quinckeanum was found to contain large quantities of superoxide anion, as judged by the nitroblue-tetrazolium test. Consequently, the xanthine (or hypoxanthine) and xanthine oxidase system in which the main product is superoxide anion had no toxic effect on the fungus. The high sensitivity of dermatophytes to killing by the H2O2-peroxidase-halide system active in polymorphonuclear neutrophils and macrophages may account in part for fungal toxicity in vivo.
