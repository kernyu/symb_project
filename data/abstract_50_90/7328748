We carried out experimental and clinical studies on tobramycin (TOB), and the following results obtained. 1. Antibacterial activity Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of TOB against clinically isolated 20 strains of P. aeruginosa, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, P. mirabilis, S. marcescens and S. faecalis was determined. Except of S. marcescens, the great part of those strains were under than 25 micrograms/ml. 2. Clinical effect TOB was treated 11 patients with chronic complicated urinary tract infection in the dose of 40-60 mg twice a day for 5 days by intravenous drip infusion. Clinical effect was excellent in 2 patients, good in 4 and poor in 5, efficacy rate was 55%. In bacteriological effects, eradication rate of causative 12 strains was 67%. Side effect was not observed for all cases.
