Responsiveness of experimental chemotherapy on human cancer xenografts in nude mice was directly compared with clinical response to the same chemotherapy in their donor patients. These xenografts were 1 line of rectal cancer (H-26), two lines of gastric cancer (H-08 and H-22), and 1 line of breast cancer (H-62). Experimental chemotherapies studied were single-drug FT-207 to four lines of xenografts and a combination of mitomycin C, 5-FU, and cytosine arabinoside (MFC) to a line of gastric cancer H-08. Single-drug treatment with FT-207 to H-26 resulted in remarkable retardation of the tumor growth. The comparative treatment with FT-207 suppository to the donor patient of H-26 showed appreciable response. All the other chemotherapies to three other lines (H-08, H-22, and H-62) induced no significant response, which was parallel to the corresponding clinical response in each donor patient. The sensitivity to chemotherapeutic drugs was thought to be still preserved in human cancer xenografts in nude mice.
