Studies on 3H-dihydrostreptomycin accumulation and binding to ribosomes showed that ineffective strain CMts17 carries strB type mutation changing its membrane permeability to the drug. Introduction of high level streptomycin resistance of strA type into strain CMts17 was correlated with acquisition of effectiveness and membrane permeability to the drug. This suggests that changes in membrane permeability, responsible for ineffectiveness of strain CMts17, can be reversed by strA mutation.
