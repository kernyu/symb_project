The in vitro susceptibilities of 22 penicillinase-producing and 32 non-penicillinase-producing strains of Neisseria gonorrhoeae to 13 antimicrobial agents, including the new semisynthetic penicillins and cephalosporins, are reported. Ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, and cefotaxime were the most active agents tested; none of them had an MIC of greater than 0.03 micrograms/ml. Amoxycillin plus clavulanic acid and temocillin also showed good activity against both strains of gonococci.
