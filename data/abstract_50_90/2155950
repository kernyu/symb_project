Fourteen 1- to 4-week-old hysterectomy-produced and colostrum-deprived (HPCD) pigs were inoculated intranasally with wild-type and ara-T-resistant strains of Aujeszky's disease virus (ADV), and the pathological lesion induced by the two strains was compared. The wild-type strain (YS-81) led to high mortality, and the pigs developed multifocal necrosis throughout the body and encephalitis. In comparison, the ara-T-resistant strain (YS-81TR) of the virus killed only 1-week-old HPCD pigs inoculated with 10(6.0) PFU per ml of the virus and did not kill pigs more than 2-weeks of age. The latter revealed consistently severe pneumonitis on post-inoculation day (PID) 14. Results of the present study indicated that the ara-T-resistant strain of ADV was less virulent for HPCD pigs than the parental wild-type strain of ADV and that it was able to grow better in the lung than in any other tissue.
