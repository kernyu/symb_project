We analyzed the antibiotic susceptibility of 5,348 urinary isolates of Escherichia coli, "Klebsiella aerogenes," and Proteus mirabilis grown in three laboratories from 1980 to 1985. A continuous rise in resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was observed; 63% of the strains from inpatients in 1984 and 51% of those from outpatients in 1985 were resistant to this drug. Isolates from outpatients in 1985 were mostly susceptible to nitrofurantoin (mean susceptibility, 92%) and to oral cephalosporins (mean susceptibility, 84%). As for isolates from inpatients, none of the antimicrobial agents now used was satisfactory for initial chemotherapy, indicating a need for new antibacterial strategies.
