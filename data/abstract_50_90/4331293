Single-step mutants of Bacillus subtilis blocked at stage zero of sporulation (spoO mutants) are pleiotropic. They are impaired in several traits, including increased sensitivity to polymyxin B, when compared to the wild type. Revertants for one or another of the traits associated in this pleiotropy have been isolated and classified according to their phenotypes. Attention was centered on partial revertants (spoO still), of which at least three classes could be recognized. Class I partial revertants recovered a high level of resistance to polymyxin and, in a constant order, a variable number of the other traits; some kind of hierarchy is thus revealed to exist among the traits affected in the original pleiotropy. Partial revertants in the other two classes are still hypersensitive to polymyxin. In class II revertants, ability to excrete exoenzymes and antibiotic(s) is recovered to various extents. Only inducibility of nitrate reductase by nitrate is recovered in class III mutants. The possible significance of these observations is discussed.
