Chloramphenicol, thiamphenicol and three fluorinated derivatives, Sch 24893, Sch 25298 and Sch 25393, were studied with respect to inhibition of the growth of selected bacterial strains and cell-free translation systems. Thiamphenicol was the least potent inhibitor in the former experiments, but behaved similarly to chloramphenicol and Sch 25298 in the latter, thereby displaying selective inhibition of prokaryotic protein synthesis. Thiamphenicol and Sch 25298 were shown to be like chloramphenicol in inhibiting peptidyl transferase activity specifically on 70 S ribosomes, but the antibiotics bound to their common ribosomal-receptor site with different efficiencies in the order chloramphenicol greater than thiamphenicol greater than Sch 25298. Selected bacterial strains highly resistant to chloramphenicol and thiamphenicol because of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase production were, in contrast, highly sensitive to inhibition by the fluorinated antibiotics. Thus Sch 24893, Sch 25298 and Sch 25393 may have important uses in veterinary and clinical medicine.
