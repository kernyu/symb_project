Using both normal and transformed rat liver epithelial cells to prepare cytoplasmic hybrids (cybrids) we have found evidence to support the theory that the cytoplasm from a normal cell can suppress tumorigenicity. A unique aspect of this study is that all of the cells utilized, both normal and malignantly transformed, were derived from an original cloned cell. We found that fusing cytoplasts from normal cells to malignantly transformed whole cells resulted in cybrid clones which, when injected into newborn rat pups, isogenic with those from which the cell culture was initiated, yielded tumors in 51% of the animals injected compared to 92% of the animals injected with the tumorigenic parent. Those animals that did develop tumors from the cybrid cells survived longer than those injected with cells from the tumorigenic parent. Thus, the cybrid, formed of cytoplasm from both parents, was less tumorigenic than the malignantly transformed parent cell. When reconstituted cells were prepared by fusing cytoplasts from normal cells with karyoplasts from malignantly transformed cells, a situation in which essentially all of the cytoplasm of the reconstituted cell is derived from normal cells, the tumorigenic phenotype was extinguished.
