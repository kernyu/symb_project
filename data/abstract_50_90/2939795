Ciprofloxacin was administered orally to 48 patients with 24 Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections and 13 other infections caused by cephalothin-resistant gram-negative bacilli. The types of infections treated included those of skin or skin structure, bone, urinary tract, and respiratory tract. In 83% of P. aeruginosa infections, a favorable clinical outcome occurred, compared with 85% for all infections. Failure to achieve a cure correlated with the emergence of resistant P. aeruginosa and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus strains in four instances and superinfection with Candida (two cases) and Streptococcus (two cases) species. Therapy was discontinued in three patients because of the development of nausea. Ciprofloxacin appears to be safe and effective in the therapy of infections caused by resistant gram-negative bacilli.
