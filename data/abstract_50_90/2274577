Resistance to antifolate drugs such as pyrimethamine is widespread among malaria parasites of the most pathogenic species Plasmodium falciparum. These drugs inhibit the dihydrofolate reductase activity of the dihydrofolate reductase-thymidylate synthetase (DHFR-TS) bifunctional enzyme. This review examines work done to characterize the enzyme, the cloning of plasmodial DHFR-TS genes, chromosomal mapping studies of these genes by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, and the structural insights into the mechanism of drug resistance that have been gained by comparing genes from drug-sensitive parasites with those from drug-resistant strains that have arisen in the field or after experimental induction.
