Heat-killed Lactobacillus casei YIT 9018 (LC 9018) cells enhanced the resistance to herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) in adult mice, but not significantly. The protection of mice against HSV-1 infection and the production of neutralizing antibodies were significantly enhanced by the administration of LC 9018 in combination with inactivated HSV-1 antigen. The optimal enhancement of resistance was seen in mice 14 days after the simultaneous administration of these substances. The resistance to HSV-1 infection in mice could be transferred with peritoneal exudate cells from syngeneic mice previously treated with LC 9018 alone and LC 9018 in combination with inactivated HSV-1 antigen or with thioglycollate broth, whereas the transfer of peritoneal exudate cells induced by thioglycollate broth alone and of spleen cells induced by LC 9018 in combination with thioglycollate broth or by thioglycollate broth alone was not effective. These results suggest that mouse peritoneal macrophages induced by the administration of LC 9018 in combination with inactivated HSV-1 antigen may play an important role in host defense mechanisms against HSV-1 infection.
