Several new penicillins and cephalosporins have provided important advances in the therapy of infections caused by gram-negative aerobic bacilli. Older agents, alone or in combination, possess equivalent or greater activity against gram-positive and anaerobic organisms and most community-acquired gram-negative enteric pathogens. Thus, newer agents are useful primarily for the treatment of highly resistant hospital-acquired gram-negative infections. Financial pressures created by the DRG era may favor their broader application, thus creating further resistance by selection or induction. However, prudent use of these agents for selected serious infections or for individuals threatened by aminoglycoside toxicity will yield the most durable cost-effective results.
