1. Clarithromycin (TE-031, A-56268) was given orally to 46 children with respiratory infections, skin infections and others. A total of 9 patients were excluded; 8 patients refused to take the drug because of it's taste, and 1 patient was later found to have viral pneumonia. Clinical efficacy was therefore evaluated in remaining 37 cases and was good or excellent in 27 cases. 2. Bacteriologically, Haemophilus influenzae strains isolated from 4 patients were eradicated in 1 and decreased in 3, respectively. Haemophilus parainfluenzae and Staphylococcus aureus isolated from 1 patient each were both eradicated. 3. Side effect or abnormal laboratory test values were not observed. 4. Based on the above findings, it appears that TE-031 is a safe and is useful antibiotic for the treatment of mild and moderate respiratory infections. It is necessary, however, to improve the taste of the current granule preparation in order to make the drug more easily palatable to children.
