We compared the relationship of the blood glucose level to the plasma 1,5-anhydroglucitol (1,5AG) level between KK mice with abnormal glucose metabolism and ICR mice as controls. Although the plasma 1,5AG level did not show any significant correlation with the blood glucose level in the controls, it tended to logarithmically decrease with the rise in the blood glucose level in KK mice. Thus it is possible that the plasma 1,5AG level is specifically related to the abnormal glucose metabolism in this model of diabetes mellitus and that its routine examination in diabetic patients may help delineate the metabolic derangement in the disease.
