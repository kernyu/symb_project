The complete nucleotide sequence of Staphylococcus aureus plasmid pUB10 was determined. The sequence consists of 4545 b.p. and contains 64% A-T and 36% G-C pairs. pUB110 was found to contain four open reading frames, capable of coding for polypeptides having more than 80 amino acids. All the putative polypeptides are coded for by one DNA strand. The molecular weights of four putative polypeptides are (in kilodaltons): A-49.5; B-38.8; C-28.8 and D-9.5. Polypeptide C is involved in kanamycin resistance. Polypeptide B is, possibly, involved in pUB110 replication. No role has yet been established for polypeptides A and D, since deletions in their coding sequences have no detectable effect on any properties of pUB110 plasmid.
