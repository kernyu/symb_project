In experiments on rats and rabbits with tetanus poisoning, activation of the nonspecific defence factors (humoral and cellular) was found in the early periods after administration of tetanus toxin. The growth of specific hemagglutinins was recorded later. The survival of the animals was prolonged and the titers of specific antibodies decreased in the course of administering the alpha-adrenoblocker butyroxan.
