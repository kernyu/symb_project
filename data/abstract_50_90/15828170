Viomycin-resistant strains isolated from Mycobacterium smegmatis demonstrated pleiotropic resistance to tuberactinomycin-N, capreomycin, streptomycin, and kanamycin as a result of mutational alteration of ribosomes, even though they were selected for resistance to a single antibiotic. The pleiotropic drug resistance of three mutants isolated by stepwise selection for resistance to viomycin was due to alteration of the 30S ribosomal subunit. One mutant, strain A, isolated independently by multiple-step selection to viomycin resistance, was resistant to viomycin, tuberactinomycin-N, and capreomycin through an alteration of the 50S ribosomal subunit, whereas it was sensitive to kanamycin but resistant to streptomycin through an alteration of the 30S ribosomal subunit. Three streptomycin-resistant strains, which were isolated by one-step selection at a high concentration of streptomycin, did not show significant co-resistance to any other antibiotics tested in culture and cell-free systems; streptomycin resistance in these mutants was localized on the 30S ribosomal subunit.
