Thirty-six hospitalized patients, 18 in each of two groups, with postpartum upper genital tract infection were enrolled in a randomized, prospective study comparing treatment with sulbactam/ampicillin, to treatment with clindamycin/gentamicin. One (5.5%) clinical failure was reported in each group. Side effects were minimal in both groups and did not warrant discontinuation of treatment. The in vitro activity of ampicillin versus sulbactam/ampicillin (1:2) was evaluated and these data were compared with data from other drugs commonly used for aerobic and anaerobic infections. Sulbactam eliminated resistance to ampicillin in all anaerobic and most aerobic isolates.
