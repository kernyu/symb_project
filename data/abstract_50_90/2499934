In a prospective multicenter clinical trial, 69 patients with Pseudomonas infections were treated with netilmicin sulfate as the only antipseudomonal antibiotic. Clinical resolution or improvement was observed for 81% of the infections, whereas 19% were considered treatment failures. The bacteriologic response, based on follow-up culture results, showed elimination of Pseudomonas from 62% of the infection sites, with persistence in 30%. All isolates were susceptible by disk susceptibility testing (zone greater than or equal to 15 mm), and by microdilution testing in unsupplemented broth. The majority of isolates, however, were resistant in cation supplemented media. The clinical failures could be accounted for by factors other than netilmicin failure. In conclusion, netilmicin appeared effective as treatment for netilmicin-susceptible Pseudomonas infections in nonneutropenic adults. A low incidence of nephrotoxicity (12%) occurred despite careful monitoring of serum levels.
