A physical and genetic map of the IncP plasmid R1033 was constructed: restriction fragments were subcloned and antibiotic resistance genes were located. The map is consistent with previous reports that R1033 is a derivative of RP4 carrying a 16-kb transposon Tn1696 which contains the antibiotic-resistance determinants present on R1033 but not on RP4. A BamHI fragment from R1033, determining resistance to gentamicin, spectinomycin and streptomycin, was cloned into Tn5, replacing the central Bg/II fragment that determined kanamycin resistance, producing a recombinant transposon Tn5-GmSpSm. This was shown to transpose in Rhizobium leguminosarum at a frequency similar to that of the parental Tn5.
