Streptococcus mutans (Streptomycin resistant) was seeded to enamel slabs in the Intraoral Cariogenicity Test (ICT). After seven days in vivo, S. mutans comprised 58% of the total streptococci in the seeded plaque, compared to approximately 1% for the non-seeded control plaque. Seeding S. mutans to the ICT resulted in a change in the proportion of total streptococci in plaques, but no difference in ICT caries compared to control slabs was recorded.
