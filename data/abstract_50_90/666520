120 Staphylococcus aureus strains from different and sporadic pathological process in swines have been investigated on biochemical properties and phage patterns. 98 strains (82%) exhibit coagulation of human plasma, no coagulation of bovine plasma, crystal-violet-type C, hemolysin-type beta, no formation of fibrinolysine and sensitivity for phages of group I, III and M. Only in few strains we observed reactions with phages of group II. 26 from 66 strains were resistant to antibiotics, and among them 24 showed resistance to oxytetracacline.
