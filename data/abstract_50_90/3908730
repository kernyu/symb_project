Ceftizoxime suppository (CZX-S) was given to 6 patients, with the following results. The peak serum concentration of CZX was 1.8-7.5 micrograms/ml at 30 minutes after dosing of CZX-S with 9.6-16.7 mg/kg. The antibacterial activity of CZX revealed that the drug can be expected to be effective sufficiently. The overall effect of CZX-S was "markedly improved" in 1 and "moderately improved" in 3 of the 4 patients with pneumonia and "markedly improved" in 1 and "slightly improved" in 1 of the 2 with UTI. CZX-S caused a slight increase in frequency of defecation in 2 of the 6 patients. There were no abnormal findings of symptoms or laboratory test values which were ascribable to side effects.
