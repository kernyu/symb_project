Plasma fibronectin was determined using a laser nephelometric method in 10 patients with acute myeloid leukaemia undergoing chemotherapy. There was a continuous fall during the first 3 weeks to about 50% of the normal level. The decrease of fibronectin may contribute to the lowered resistance against infection characteristic of these patients.
