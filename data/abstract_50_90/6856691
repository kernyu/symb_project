Four strains of Zymomonas mobilis were examined for their resistance to antimicrobial agents and found to have similar resistance profiles. Plasmid DNA was extracted and purified by CsCl dye-buoyant density centrifugation; molecular weights were determined by agarose gel electrophoresis and electron microscopy. All four strains harbored a large plasmid (46 X 10(6) Da) and a smaller plasmid (16-21 X 10(6) Da) whose molecular weight was strain dependent. Two strains, Ag11 and ATCC 10988, had smaller plasmids of unique molecular weight. Homology existed between the plasmids in the four strains as shown by cross-reaction in DNA-DNA blot hybridizations. Only one plasmid appeared unique to the host from which it was isolated.
