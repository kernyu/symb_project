Escherichia coli bearing a cryptic tetracycline resistance determinant from Bacteroides fragilis expressed low-level constitutive resistance to tetracycline under aerobic, but not anaerobic, growth conditions and accumulated less tetracycline aerobically than did isogenic susceptible cells. This decreased uptake was energy dependent and reversible by increased concentrations of tetracycline, suggesting a saturable carrier-mediated active efflux mechanism. Decreased uptake was not seen when the cells were grown and assayed anaerobically. Other tetracycline resistance determinants (classes A to E) isolated from gram-negative enteric bacteria expressed resistance and generated active efflux of tetracycline under anaerobic as well as aerobic conditions. When the Bacteroides determinant was placed in the same cell with any of the class A to E tetracycline resistance determinants, there was an increase in resistance under aerobic conditions of as much as 48% more than was projected by adding the resistances expressed by the determinants individually. In cells bearing the class A determinant together with the Bacteroides determinant, saturation of the active efflux system required over twofold more exogenous tetracycline than did cells bearing the class A determinant alone. We have designated this new tetracycline resistance determinant class F.
