Ampicillin (A), streptomycin (S), aminosidin (K), chloramphenical (C) and tetracycline (T) resistance was investigated in 130 S. typhi murium, 18 Shigella flexneri and 13 Shigella sonnei strains, recovered from enteritis cases in 1970-1973. All Salmonella and 70% Shigella strains (without any appreciable differences between Sh. sonnei and flexneri) were found resistant and most multiresistant. A-S-K-C-T resistance was frequently found: in 48% of the Salmonella and 12% of the Shigella strains. As for resistance transfer by conjugation, it was obtained in more than 90% of the resistant strains. The Authors, after some remarks about transferable resistance factors diffusion, give some advices on antibiogram making technique.
