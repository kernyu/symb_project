The resistance to anti-microbial agents of bacteria isolated from pathological conditions of birds in Victoria, 1978 to 1983, was determined for isolates of Escherichia coli, Salmonella species, Staphylococcus aureus, Pasteurella multocida, P. anatipestifer, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis and Haemophilus paragallinarum. The isolates of E. coli had a high prevalence of resistance to tetracycline and sulphonamides, and a lower prevalence of resistance to furazolidone and sulphamethoxazole-trimethoprim. The isolates of Salmonella spp commonly had resistance to tetracycline, sulphonamides, furazolidone and sulphamethoxazole-trimethoprim. Almost half the isolates of S. aureus showed resistance to lincomysin and many showed resistance to penicillin. Resistance to tetracycline was found in isolates of P. multocida, P. anatepestifer and Y. pseudotuberculosis. Some isolates of H. paragallinarum showed resistance to sulphonamides, streptomycin and sulphamethoxazole-trimethoprim.
