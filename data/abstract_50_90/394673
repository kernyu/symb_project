Escherichia coli were isolated at concentrations of about 10(2)/ml from the fluid obtained after thawing each of five frozen chicken carcasses. Between 13 and 89% of the E. coli were resistant to mercury(II) or to at least one of eight antibiotics tested. Multiple resistance was more common than single resistance, and resistances to tetracycline, streptomycin, sulfathiazole, or chloramphenicol were more frequently encountered than was resistance to ampicillin or mercury(II). Resistance to kanamycin, gentamicin, or trimethoprim occurred rarely. Upwards of 30% of the E. coli apparently carried conjugative plasmids and could transfer at least one of their resistance determinants to E. coli K-12. Twenty-five conjugative R plasmids obtained in this way were characterized within strain K-12 by a variety of phenotypic criteria. Twenty could be assigned to the incompatibility groups Inc X, Inc N, Inc FI, or Inc I alpha.
