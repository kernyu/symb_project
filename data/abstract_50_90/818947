The study of sensitivity to some antibiotics and chemotherapeutics of 250 cultures of the main causative agents of the inflammatory diseases of the bile secretion system, i. e. Coli bacteria, Proteus, Ps. aeruginosa and Staphylococcus showed that the above microorganisms were in most cases highly resistant to the antibacterial drugs widely used in the clinical practice. The exclusion presented the drugs of the aminoglycoside group and especially gentamycin which had the highest activity. The analysis of multiple resistance showed that 96 per cent of the strains were resistant to 5 and more antibacterial drugs.
