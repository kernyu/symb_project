Streptococcus lactis IL1403 protoplasts were transformed by plasmid pIL204 (5.5 kilobases), which conferred erythromycin resistance with an average efficiency of 5 X 10(6) transformants per microgram of supercoiled DNA. The procedure used and transformation efficiencies obtained were close to those described for Bacillus subtilis (G. Chang and S. N. Cohen, Mol. Gen. Genet. 168:111-115, 1979).
