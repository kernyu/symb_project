This review paper is concerned with antibacterial therapy of mastitis caused by Escherichia coli. The choice of an antibacterial agent is discussed, and nine criteria are referred to, on which this choice should be based. In the second part possible forms of antibacterial treatment are discussed. Literature on parenteral and local treatment of mastitis due to E. coli is scarcely available. The evaluation of antibacterial drugs is mainly based on MIC values and pharmacokinetic studies in normal animals. Unfortunately, results of clinical trials are hardly available. Today combinations of trimethoprim/sulphonamide apparently are the best available choice for the parenteral treatment of mastitis caused by E. coli. Infusion of polymyxins or gentamycin is discussed as a method of intramammary therapy.
