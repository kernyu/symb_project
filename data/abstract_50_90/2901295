The oliC3 gene of Aspergillus niger has been isolated and sequenced. This gene encodes an oligomycin-resistant variant of the mitochondrial ATP synthase subunit 9. In transformation experiments the gene can serve as a semi-dominant selectable marker for A. niger. It was possible to recognize transformants in which oliC3 had integrated at the homologous oliC locus, as opposed to elsewhere in the genome, by observation of phenotypes on medium containing oligomycin. DNA sequencing has allowed comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence with subunit 9 proteins from other species and comparison of 5' untranslated sequences with those from other fungi.
