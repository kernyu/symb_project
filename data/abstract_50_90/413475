The effect of antibiotics on clinical strains of Ps. aeruginosa was analyzed. It shown that 92 per cent of the strains had multiple resistance to the most of the antibiotics used in the clinic. All the strains were sensitive to gentamicin and polymyxin. The apyocinogenic strains of Ps. aeruginosa were more sensitive to the effect of the antibiotics than the pyocinogenic ones.
