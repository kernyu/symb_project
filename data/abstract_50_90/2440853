The purified ermC methyltransferase described here incorporates two methyl groups per Bacillus subtilis 23S rRNA molecule in vitro. The Km for S-adenosyl-L-methionine was 12 microM, and for B. subtilis 23S rRNA the Km was 375 nM. In vivo methylation specified by several related resistance determinants prevented in vitro methylation by the ermC enzyme, suggesting that methylation specified by all of these determinants occurs at homologous sites. Since methyl groups were incorporated in protein-free 23S rRNA molecules, the structure of rRNA alone must contain sufficient information to specify the methylation site.
