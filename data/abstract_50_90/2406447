Fifty-two strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae were examined for production of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) by a rapid technique based upon induction of enzyme activity and chemical assay. This method was compared with one measuring the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) by agar dilution and a diffusion test with disks containing 10 micrograms, 30 micrograms and 50 micrograms of chloramphenicol. The MIC for 13 chloramphenicol-resistant strains was 16 mg/L and for 39 sensitive strains less than or equal to 4 mg/L. The chemical assay clearly distinguished resistant from sensitive strains; it was technically simple and provided results within 90 min. The distinction between sensitive and resistant bacteria in the disk diffusion assay was clearer with 10-micrograms than with 30-microgram and 50-micrograms disks. However, the chemical CAT assay, with enzyme induction, is recommended when a rapid result is required.
