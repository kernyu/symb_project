The discipline of immunology has made very rapid progress during the past twenty years. A general introductory part was followed by a discussion of immunological components in resistance. Subsequently, the importance of controlling the immunological system was stressed. The significance of the network theory was briefly referred to. Attention was then drawn to specific and non-specific stimulation of the immune response, which are essential both in theory and in actual practice. A number of instances are cited to illustrate these features in recent developments in the fields of preparation of vaccines and immunological treatment of cancer. It was pointed out that, during the past decades, the discipline of immunology not only made great strides in the field of human medicine and experimental animal models associated with this branch of medicine but also in that of veterinary medicine. It was predicted that immunology would also continue to be essential in the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of disease in animals.
