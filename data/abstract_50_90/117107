Oxidation of an array of 2,4-diamino-6-(arylthio)quinazolines provided the corresponding arylsulfinyl and arylsulfonyl analogues. A variety of these nonclassical analogues of methotrexate exhibited suppressive antimalarial activity superior to that of the parent thioquinazolines against drug-sensitive lines of Plasmodium berghei in mice and P. gallinaceum in chicks, and several displayed potent prophylactic activity against P. gallinaceum. The sulfinyl- and sulfonylquinazolines also retained antimalarial effects against chloroquine-, cycloguanil-, and DDS-resistant lines of P. berghei in mice and against chloroquine- and pyrimethamine-resistant strains of P. falciparum in owl monkeys. Coadministration of one of the most active of these compounds, 2,4-diamino-6-(2-naphthylsulfonyl)-quinazoline (35), with sulfadiazine to monkeys infected with P. falciparum of P. vivax led to greatly enhanced activity and prevented the development of quinazoline resistance.
