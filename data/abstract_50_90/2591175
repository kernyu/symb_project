This study investigated patterns of resistance in anaerobic organisms isolated at Westmead Hospital in Sydney, Australia, during the years 1987 to 1988. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) to ampicillin, sulbactam/ampicillin, metronidazole, clindamycin, and cefoxitin were determined by agar dilution for 200 anaerobes from clinically significant infections. Antibiotics active against nearly all of these anaerobes included metronidazole and sulbactam/ampicillin, which demonstrated good activity against beta-lactamase producing Bacteroides spp. with the exception of Bacteroides distasonis. Resistance in non-beta-lactamase producing anaerobes was similar to that seen with ampicillin. As expected, ampicillin resistance was common in the Bacteroides fragilis group where beta-lactamase production was frequent. In addition, beta-lactamase was detected in 33% of other Bacteroides spp. Ampicillin resistance was also seen in 5 to 15% of additional anaerobes that did not produce beta-lactamase. Clindamycin resistance occurred in 4 to 18% of the B. fragilis group. Clindamycin resistance was also seen in 7 to 8% of Clostridium spp. and anaerobic Gram-positive cocci. Resistance to cefoxitin was variable in the B. fragilis group with the highest levels of resistance occurring in the indole-negative subgroup. Resistance in other anaerobes was not commonly seen.
