The development of resistance to vincristine, actinomycin D and cisplatin has been examined in a human epidermoid lung carcinoma xenograft line (HXL 55) growing in nude mice. Treatment of HXL 55 with 1 mg kg-1 vincristine or 0.5 mg kg-1 actinomycin D once in each in vivo passage resulted in a rapid reduction in tumour responsiveness to these drugs. A partial resistance was already acquired at the 2nd transplant generation. In contrast, a gradual decrease in therapeutic response was observed with 10 mg kg-1 cisplatin. Irradiation with a local dose of 10 Gy induced no resistance. The three induced drug-resistant sublines were characterized in terms of the time course of development of resistance, the degree of induced resistance, cross-resistance, growth rate and stability of the phenotype.
