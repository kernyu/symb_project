World areas with chloroquine-resistant falciparum malaria are progressively spreading, in Africa from East to West. We are reporting here a new case of resistance, grade III, from Cameroon, carried out in vitro by the WHO standard macrotest. Resistance is determined by the ability of trophozoites to develop into schizonts when therapeutic doses of chloroquine have been administered.
