Pharmacokinetic data obtained from 41 patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation were used to give quinidine therapy on an individual basis. The proposed approach made it possible to restore sinus rhythm in 80% of the patients and to identify patients having "true" resistance to the drug. To restore the rhythm, 24 and 48 hours were required for 24 and 9 patients, respectively. The application of the pharmacokinetic approach allows the total therapeutic dose of the agent to be reduced and, to a considerable extent, the risk of side and toxic effects to be lowered.
