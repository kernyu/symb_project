We have been collected the causative isolates from patients with urinary tract infections (UTI) from the 8 institutions in Japan during 1980-1983. All strains isolated from UTI and recognized as etiologically responsible in each institution were sent to Bacteriology Laboratory of Juntendo University Hospital, Tokyo and the species of these strains were reidentified. We classified the UTI into 3 categories, simple, complicated without catheter and complicated with catheter. Of all strains isolated as etiologically responsible from cases of simple UTI, 65.3% were E. coli and 9.6%, Klebsiella spp. in 1983: these species accounted for about 75% of all isolates. Most frequently isolated from patients without catheter were E. coli 27.6% in 1983, followed in order by Pseudomonas spp. (20.9%), Gram-positive bacteria (16.7%), Serratia spp. (8.8%), Klebsiella spp. (8.0%) and Proteus spp. (7.1%). In complicated UTI with catheter, Pseudomonas spp. were most frequently isolated (25.6%), followed in order by Gram-positive bacteria (22.9%), Serratia spp. (15.0%), Proteus spp. (12.4%), Enterobacter spp. (6.0%) and Klebsiella spp. (6.0%). A remarkable difference, that is, Gram-positive bacteria, especially S. aureus, showed conspicuous increase of isolation between 1982 and 1983. Furthermore, we discussed the detailed analysis of patient background to clinical bacterial isolates from UTI in respect of patient distribution by sex, types of infections, distributions by age in male and female, interrelations between the species of bacterial isolates and types of infection and antimicrobial chemotherapy.
