A novel eukaryotic hybrid gene has been constructed from the 5' sequence of a rat gene and the bacterial neomycin-resistance gene. After transfection into hamster fibroblasts, the neo transcripts can be induced to high levels by the absence of glucose. Furthermore, this hybrid gene can be regulated by temperature when it is introduced into a temperature-sensitive mutant cell line.
