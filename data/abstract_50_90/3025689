The spontaneous recovery of activity of tet gene deleted of the promoter region was studied. Plasmid pBRS188 was used as a model for studying this problem. The plasmid has the fragment of tet gene of pBR322, from which it originates, between the sites of restriction endonucleases EcoRI and HindIII cleavage resulting in inactivation of tet promoter. E. coli cells harbouring the plasmid were shown to revert the TcR phenotype with the frequency 10(-9). The gene activation coincided with intraplasmid recombination revealed by restriction analysis. In some cases the recovery of tet gene activity coincided with the formation of multimeric plasmids.
