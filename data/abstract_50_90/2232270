During the period from November 1987 to March 1988, 301 strains of S. aureus isolated from clinical specimens were collected from 6 hospitals in Okinawa main island. Thirty seven percent of the strains were resistant to methicillin (MRSA, MIC greater than or equal to 12.5 micrograms/ml). There was a difference in an isolation frequency among the hospitals from 13 to 52%. The strains were isolated from pus, sputum and urine with high frequency. As coagulase typing of MRSA, Type II and III strains predominantly isolated with 54% and 40%, respectively. Among the antimicrobial agents tested, about 90-99% MRSA were resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics and aminoglycosides and no resistant strain was observed to MINO. To IPM/CS and OFLX, 84% and 75% of the strains were sensitive, respectively. MRSA is a hospital strain and may be a causative microorganism for a hospital and opportunistic infection.
