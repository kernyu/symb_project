Sensitivity of 2 subspecies of the tularemia causative agent to spectinomycin, an aminoglycoside antibiotic, was studied in vitro. The MIC of the antibiotic with respect to strains 503/847 and Schu was 40 micrograms/ml and with respect to strain A-Cole 20 micrograms/ml. The frequency of spontaneous spectinomycin resistant mutants was low. The mutants grown on a medium containing spectinomycin in a concentration of 100 micrograms/ml were highly resistant to the antibiotic (at least 10000 micrograms/ml). By the main biological properties and virulence the spectinomycin resistant mutants did not differ from the initial strains.
