First stage larvae of a number of species of parasitic nematodes of sheep have been shown to develop to third stage larvae in the presence of a defined medium consisting of Earle's balanced salt solution and yeast extract. A larval development test, based on this culture technique, was used as a screen for detecting the presence of anthelmintic resistance in nematodes of sheep. It was found to be sensitive and simple to use and also appeared capable of detecting resistance to any of the main anthelmintic groups. Available anthelmintic sensitive and resistant strains of Haemonchus contortus and Ostertagia circumcincta showed differences in development when incubated in the presence of either thiabendazole, levamisole and ivermectin. These differences were expressed as the minimum inhibitory concentration required to prevent larval development over the incubation period.
