Cells from small (sigma) and large (lambda) trifluorothymidine-resistant (TFTr) colonies induced by chemical mutagen treatment of TK+/-L5178Y mouse lymphoma cells were examined for chromosomal abnormalities. Analysis of G-banded metaphase chromosomes from 34 sigma-TFTr colonies revealed that cells from 20 (59%) possessed one or more chromosomal abnormalities. The most frequent (16/20 colonies) abnormality observed in cells from sigma-TFTr colonies involved the addition of extra chromatin to the distal region of one chromosome number 11. In 13 of these 16 colonies, the origin of the chromatin translocated to chromosome number 11 could not be identified; the chromatin was not missing elsewhere in the genome. The remaining three sigma-TFTr colonies with an abnormal chromosome number 11 had apparently whole chromosomes translocated, in tandem, to the distal region of chromosome number 11. Chromosomal abnormalities observed in cells from sigma-TFTr colonies with normal number 11 chromosomes included 2N/4N and 2N/4N/8N mosaicism (two colonies), a Robertsonian translocation involving chromosome 10 and a marker chromosome (one colony), and trisomy 7 (one colony). In most (14/16) sigma-TFTr colonies with structural damage to chromosome number 11, the cells within a colony were heterogeneous in that some possessed chromosomal damage whereas others were apparently normal. Analysis of chromosomes in cells from eight lambda-TFTr colonies revealed one colony in which all cells had a Robertsonian translocation involving chromosomes 1 and 16 plus other structural abnormalities. The chromosomes of cells from the remaining lambda-TFTr colonies were apparently normal.
