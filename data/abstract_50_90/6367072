An outbreak of urinary tract infections caused by multidrug-resistant Serratia marcescens lasted for 12 months and was found to be related to urologic instrumentation. Thirty-four patients had primary infections; four had cross-infections. Only six patients had indwelling bladder catheters. The median interval between instrumentation and initial isolation of Serratia was six days. Seventy-three percent of patients were symptomatic, two were bacteremic. No common instruments, personnel, or wards were identified, and environmental cultures failed to reveal the epidemic strain of Serratia. The outbreak ended when the instrument disinfectant was changed. Serotyping was identical in nine of ten isolates. Intraspecies conjugation demonstrated resistance transfer of gentamicin, tobramycin, carbenicillin, chloramphenicol, and co-trimoxazole. The enzyme 6'-N-acetyl transferase was responsible for gentamicin-inactivation in patient isolates and a transconjugate. Although no significant spread of this multidrug-resistance plasmid to other Enterobacteriaceae occurred in the hospital, two instances of apparent in vivo transfer to other bladder organisms occurred.
