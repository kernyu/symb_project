The inhibitory activities of 2 new orally absorbed antifungal imidazole derivatives, BAY n 7133 and BAY 1 9139, were compared in vitro with those of ketoconazole and miconazole. Clinical isolates of pathogenic fungi tested included 35 yeasts, 62 dimorphic fungal pathogens, 37 filamentous fungi and 31 dermatophytes. LY 121019, a semisynthetic analog of echinocandin B, was included in tests with the pathogenic yeasts. Both BAY n 7133 and BAY 1 9139 were found to be broad spectrum antifungal agents. The spectra of these newer compounds were comparable to those of ketoconazole and miconazole; however only BAY n 7133 resembled these latter 2 imidazoles quantitatively in terms of the degree of antifungal activity as indicated by measurable MICs. In contrast, the spectrum of LY 121019 appeared to be confirmed only to isolates of Candida.
