120 strains of Candida spp were tested against the antifungal agents 5-fluorocytosine, amphotericine B and the imidazoles econazole, miconazole and clotrimazole. The proportion of resistance varied with the species and substances: Candida albicans (100 strains): 4% resistance against 5-fluorocytosine, 1% against amphotericine B, no resistance to imidazoles; Candida tropicalis and C. pseudotropicalis (15 strains): 26.7% resistance to 5-fluorocytosine, 7.1% against amphotericine B, no resistance to imidazoles; Candida krusei (5 strains): no resistance to the antifungal agents. The correlation between the diameter measurements carried out at 2 dose levels of 5-fluorocytosine (1 and 100 micrograms) and of econazole (20 and 30 micrograms) was studied statistically and the validity of the experimental data established.
