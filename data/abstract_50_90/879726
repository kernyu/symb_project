The effect of gentamicin on the functional state of the cells of the reticuloendothelial system (RES) of the abdominal cavity of mouse macrophages and the cell culture of the rabbit embryon kidneys was studied. Gentamicin administered intramuscularly in multiple doses of I and 10 mg/kg for 6--14 days did not induce significant changes in the absorptive activity of the RES. In doses of 20 and 40 mg/kg gentamicin induced some inhibition of the absorptive activity of the abdominal cavity macrophages, which was accompanied by a decrease in the content of the total protein and an increase in the activity of the acid phosphatase in the cell cytoplasm. The changes were reversible and persisted for not more than 48 hours after the last administration of the antibiotic. Gentamicin inhibited the cell growth in the culture of the rabbit embryon kidneys in concentrations higher than 1000 mg/kg, LD50 of gentamicin for mice weighing 20--22 gm being 244 mg/kg. Preliminary administration of amigluracyl provided a decrease in the toxic effect of gentamicin in both the cell culture and the host, which was possibly associated with the anabolyzing effect of amigluracyl.
