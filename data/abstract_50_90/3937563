Utilizing a recently described rapid needle extrusion method for determining the sensitivities of burn wound isolates, we have compiled data on the resistance patterns of over 250 isolates from our burn unit. Major isolate groups were Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, various Enterobacteriaceae and Enterococci. Excellent correlation was exhibited between the inhibitory zone sizes and the minimal inhibitory concentration for 120 organisms tested. Utilizing the needle extrusion sensitivities to facilitate the selection of the burn creams, a significant reduction in the microbiologic flora of the burn wound was noted. The utilization of this technique in the selection of burn creams deserves controlled trials to assess whether changes in topical therapy might alter clinical outcome.
