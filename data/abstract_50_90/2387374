The effect of ionophore monensin on the main parameters of cardio- and hemodynamics was studied in the experiments on anesthetized cats. Monensin (0.075-0.375 mg/kg) administered intravenously in the increasing doses was shown to produce the dose-dependent elevation of arterial blood pressure, the increase of myocardial contractility and the total peripheral resistance. A single administration of monensin (0.375 mg/kg) was found to exert the two-phase action on the parameters of cardio- and hemodynamics.
