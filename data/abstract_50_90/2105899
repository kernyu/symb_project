This report describes the clinical and laboratory observations on two patients with a Trichomonas vaginalis infection resistant to metronidazole. The metronidazole resistance was confirmed in in vitro cultures under aerobic conditions, after in vitro cultivation of the strains. Trichomonas infection persisted during high-dose intravenous metronidazole administration and Lactobacillus immunotherapy was unsuccessful in both patients.
