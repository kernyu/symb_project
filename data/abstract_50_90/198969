Comparisons of native preparation of mouse interferons, "macrophage" and "Krebs" revealed some differences, Thus, the minimal time necessary for the development of resistance to vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) in L cells treated with "macrophage" and "Krebs" interferon was 5 and 2 hours, respectively. The activity of the lysosomal enzyme of acid phosphatase was considerably higher in the cells treated with "Krebs" interferon and infected with VSV than with "macrophage" interferon. Differences in the antiviral and antioncogenic properties of fractions No. 1 and No. 5 of these interferons obtained in fractionation of native interferon preparations by the cryomethod were demonstrated. In particular, fraction No. 5 of "Krebs" interferon, in contrast to that of "macrophage" interferon, had no antioncogenic properties but did have antiviral properties. It is suggested that these differences are due to the presence in native preparations of different substances capable of exerting an effect on interferon.
