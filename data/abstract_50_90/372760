A spontaneous streptomycin-resistant Escherichia coli mutant which is temperature-sensitive for suppression of a nonsense codon was studied for its ability to propagate phages T2, T4D, T5, phi K, f2, MS2, R17, Q beta, lambda as well as filamentous phages fl, fd and M13. Of all phages tested, only the growth of Q beta, lambda, and filamentous phages is inhibited in the mutant at 42 degree C. This selective inhibition suggests that, like Q beta, lambda and filamentous phages also require a read-through proten(s) which results from suppression of a termination codon.
