Cefpimizole (AC-1370) was studied for its transference into adnexa uteri and uterine tissues as well as for its effects and safety on gynecological infections. The results obtained are as follows: Peak levels of AC-1370 were obtained in the antecubital vein and uterine artery at 10 minutes, in the tissues of adnexa uteri and uteri about 30 minutes after one shot intravenous injection of AC-1370 1 g, and relatively high concentrations were maintained for several hours. In the treatment of 30 cases of gynecological infections, the clinical efficacy of AC-1370 was assessed as effective in all cases. As for the bacteriological effects of AC-1370, 77.6% of isolated organisms were eradicated and 90% of all cases were effective. Side effects and abnormal laboratory findings due to AC-1370 were not observed during and after administration.
