There is no doubt that antibiotic usage is related to the development of resistant bacteria. Nevertheless, there is a great deal of confusion about the mechanisms involved in this process and the quantitative aspects. Bacterial genes coding for resistance can be exchanged on a molecular level between different DNA structures and they can spread from one bacterial cell to another. In quantitative terms, however, the selection of resistant bacteria in their natural environment, e.g. in the bowel flora or on mucous membranes, is the most important factor influencing the development and spread of antibiotic resistant microorganisms. The amount of drug incorporated into the bowel or soft tissue flora depends on the route of administration. Even drugs which are related in many respects differ markedly in their ability to select resistant organisms. A selection of resistant organisms from the normal human flora implicates, that primarily a minority of resistant organisms is present and overgrows the sensitive ones which are inhibited by the drug. Usually these resistant strains belong to the resident flora and carry their resistance genes on plasmids. Only rarely resistant mutants can be found, although the mutation rate might be high. The development of resistance from the population of microorganisms causing the infection is rare. This observation can be based on two rationales : 1. The mutation rate from susceptible to resistant in most microorganisms is usually rather low (about 10(-9); thus the number of microbes present on the site of infection is not high enough to allow mutants to arise.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
