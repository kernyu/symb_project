Cefamandole sodium (CMD) was intravenously administered and following laboratoric and clinical results were obtained. (1) The peak blood concentration was 32 approximately 44 micrograms/ml when the drip infusion was finished. At 1 hour after the end of the drip infusion the blood concentration was 7.6 approximately 8.1 micrograms/ml. Half life was approximately 0.64 hours. (2) Urinary recovery rate was 84.5 approximately 95% in active state within 6 hours. (3) Penetration of cerebrospinal fluid was found in 2 cases. (4) In most of 170 strains of Streptococcus haemolyticus MICs of cefamandole were 0.05 microgram/ml. They were less susceptible to cefazoline, cefmetazole and ceftezole. (5) CMD was administered to 35 pediatric patients (upper or lower RTI, lymphadenitis, enteritis or UTI) at 100 mg/kg/day for 3 approximately 9 days, the efficacy rate was 97.1%.
