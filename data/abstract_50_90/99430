Kasugamycin-resistant mutants of Bacillus subtilis were isolated and classified into two groups, one of which had resistance to kasugamycin in in vitro protein synthesis and mapped in the ribosomal region. The other group had no resistance to kasugamycin in in vitro protein synthesis and had weak cross-resistance to gentamicin and kanamycin. Neither group could sporulate in the presence of kasugamycin.
