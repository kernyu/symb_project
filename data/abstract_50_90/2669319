Mathematical modelling offers an aid to the understanding of parasitic diseases. In the past, computational limitations have meant that the role of many factors influencing the control of disease has had to be ignored or oversimplified. Using computers, these shortcomings can be overcome. Site-specific and environmental modelling offer new prospects for the management of disease. This paper illustrates the approach of computational veterinary parasitology with an application to anthelmintic and acaricidal resistance.
