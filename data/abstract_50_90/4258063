Suppression of streptomycin dependence in Escherichia coli strain K-114, a spectinomycin-sensitive strain, is correlated with modification of 30S ribosomal protein P4, the component modified in spectinomycin-resistant mutants. The mutant is unusual in that reversion from dependence has previously been correlated only with modification in 30S protein P4a. Introduction into K-114 of another mutation conferring spectinomycin resistance results in a further alteration in protein P4.
