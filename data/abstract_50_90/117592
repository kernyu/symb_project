Resistance spectra and their transferability were studied in G- strains isolated from the primary production of meat by the method after Bohus (1974). Out of the set of strains, 93% were resistant, and out of these, 65% were multiresistant. Thirty-five per cent of the resistant strains were R plasmid donors. Of the two recipients, the laboratory strain of E. coli IHE Nx was significantly better. Among the 21 determined resistance spectra, the following were the most frequent: Tc, SmTcSu, and TcAm. Transfer of two to four, or even six, different plasmid types, mostly simple, was recorded from the two most frequent complex types of donor strain resistance: SmCmTcAmSu and SmTcAmSu. The determinants Tc and Am prevailed in the spectra of the transferring R plasmids, mostly as separate markers and only in 21 to 36% of cases in more complex types.
