Cefoxitin is a beta-lactam antibiotic derived from cephamycin C, a naturally occurring substance produced by Streptomyces lactamdurans. Its resistance to destruction by beta-lactamases results in a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity which includes anaerobic as well as Gram-positive and Gram-negative aerobic bacteria, including many resistant to cephalothin and other cephalosporins. Given by intravenous or intramuscular injection, cefoxitin is effective against a wide variety of infections caused by Gram-positive or Gram-negative aerobes as well as by anaerobic bacteria. It is generally well tolerated, thrombophlebitis, skin rash and some degree of discomfort after intramuscular injection, being the most commonly reported side effects. Cefoxitin has not been shown to cause adverse effects on renal function.
