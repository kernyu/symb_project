Mutations leading to borrelidin resistance in Escherichia coli by overproduction of threonyl-transfer ribonucleic acid synthetase were anaylzed genetically. The regulatory mutations were closely linked to the treonyl-transfer ribonucleic acid synthetase structural gene (thrS), located clockwise to it. The mutation that causes the threefold-increased enzyme level was more distant from thrS than the mutation responsible for the ninefold overproduction. Both mutations were cis dominant in merodiploid strains, indicating that they affected promoter-operator-like control elements. Overproduction was restricted to threonyl-transfer ribonucleic acid synthetase and was not observed for the products of genes neighboring thrS (e.g., infC, pheS, pheT, and argS), providing evidence that thrS is transcribed singly and that gene amplificationis not a likely basis for increased thrS experession.
