Some common agents were tested for their effectiveness against Corynebacterium pyogenes. The pathogen proved most susceptable to Wofasteril. All germs were killed within ten minutes by a 0.005% solution. Equally good action was recorded from all the other tested agents as well (lactic acid, Lugol's solution, formalin, cupric sulphate, alcohol, and aethacridine. Other studies were conducted with the view to testing the survival capacity of Corynebacterium pyogenes in different media and storage conditions. The pathogen survived three months in routine media and mastitis secretion at room temperature. Regrowth of 38 in 50 strains took place after nine months of refrigerator storage in slanting blood agar tubes with paraffin plugs. Germs sampled from mastitis secretion and stored in a refrigerator were cultivable even after one year had elapsed. The detectability rate of Corynebacterium pyogenes did not change over months by storage of wound infection material at 12 degrees C below zero. The pathogen remained detectable five days from artificial contamination of cattle skin.
