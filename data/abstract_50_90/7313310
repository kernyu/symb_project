Two long-acting anthelmintics, closantel and disophenol, were tested by treatment 90, 60 and 30 days before challenge with a thiabendazole selected laboratory strain of Haemonchus contortus. The sheep were slaughtered 28 days after infection for total worm counts. A significant reduction in the number of adults remaining at autopsy was recorded after treatment with both anthelmintics 30 and 60 days before challenge but there was zero efficacy when the animals were treated 90 days before challenge. No significant difference was exhibited between the two compounds. Variability in response was recorded between animals on the 60 day period of treatment, which for disophenol may be dose related because animals receiving the lower volumes showed higher worm counts. For both anthelmintics a variability in the rate of metabolism may be responsible. The possibility offered by both anthelmintics for treating benzimidazole resistant strains of H contortus is discussed.
