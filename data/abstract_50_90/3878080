The antibacterial effects produced by ticarcillin disodium plus clavulanate potassium, a combination of the broad-spectrum penicillin ticarcillin, and the beta-lactamase inhibitor clavulanic acid as the potassium salt, have been measured in vitro and in experimental infection studies. The presence of clavulanic acid resulted in a significant enhancement of the activity of ticarcillin against a wide range of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria. These included ticarcillin-resistant strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, P. vulgaris, Yersinia enterocolitica, and the anaerobe Bacteroides fragilis. In addition, beta-lactamase-producing isolates of Hemophilus influenzae, Branhamella catarrhalis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Staphylococcus aureus were susceptible to ticarcillin and clavulanate. Clavulanic acid did not influence the activity of ticarcillin against ticarcillin-susceptible bacteria. The bactericidal effects of the antibiotic combination were measured in an in vitro kinetic model in which the drug concentrations were varied to simulate those measured in humans after intravenous dosing with ticarcillin (3.0 g) and clavulanate potassium (100 mg clavulanic acid). In these tests, ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid had pronounced bactericidal activity against ticarcillin-resistant bacteria. The protection of ticarcillin by clavulanic acid from inactivation by bacterial beta-lactamases in vivo was demonstrated in experimental infection models in which the efficacy of the ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid combination against infections caused by beta-lactamase-producing bacteria was correlated with the presence of effective concentrations of both antibiotic and inhibitor at the site of infection.
