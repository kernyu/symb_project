Significant portion (up to 20%) of dominant mutations (rifd mutations) was observed among spontaneous mutations of rifampicin resistance picked up in cells of haploid Escherichia coli strain. These mutations are similar to rifd mutations obtained earlier when selecting them in rif-s/rif-s merodiploids. On the basis of analysis of nucleotide substitutions taking place in formation of spontaneous and induced mutations, it is established that rifd mutations are caused by single nucleotide substitution. The majority of rifd mutations are localized in a small region of the central part of RNA polymerase beta-subunit gene covering less than 200 base pairs. A rifd mutant has been described which occurred as a result of micro-deletion in one of the "hot" spots of the central region of beta-subunit gene.
