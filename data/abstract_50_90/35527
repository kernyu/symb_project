Steady-state populations of Escherichia coli B/r were treated with cephaloridine at minimal inhibitory concentrations. The antibiotic sensitivity of the cells and the localization of spheroplast emergence along the cell surface were examined as a function of cell length and growth rate. In fast-growing populations (greater than 1 division per h) the sites of cephaloridine interaction occurred preferentially at the cell pole in the smaller cells and at the cell center in dividing cells. At decreasing growth rates the cells became more resistant to cephaloridine, and a gradual shift from the cell pole toward the cell center was observed for the sphere position. A similar growth rate-dependent change in localization was found for sucrose-induced plasmolysis vacuoles.
