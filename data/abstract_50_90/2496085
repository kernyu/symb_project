We tested the hypothesis that tachykinins mediate hyperpnea-induced bronchoconstriction (HIB) in 28 guinea pigs. Stimulus-response curves to increasing minute ventilation with dry gas were generated in animals depleted of tachykinins by capsaicin pretreatment and in animals pretreated with phosphoramidon, a neutral metalloendopeptidase inhibitor. Sixteen anesthetized guinea pigs received capsaicin (50 mg/kg sc) after aminophylline (10 mg/kg ip) and terbutaline (0.1 mg/kg sc). An additional 12 animals received saline (1 ml sc) instead of capsaicin. One week later, all animals were anesthetized, given propranolol (1 mg/kg iv), and mechanically ventilated (6 ml/kg, 60 breaths/min, 50% O2 in air fully water saturated). Phosphoramidon (0.5 mg iv) was administered to five of the noncapsaicin-treated guinea pigs. Eucapnic dry gas (95% O2-5% CO2) hyperpnea "challenges" were performed by increasing the tidal volume (2-6 ml) and frequency (150 breaths/min) for 5 min. Capsaicin-pretreated animals showed marked attenuation in HIB, with a rightward shift of the stimulus-response curve compared with controls; the estimated tidal volume required to elicit a twofold increase in respiratory system resistance (ES200) was 5.0 ml for capsaicin-pretreated animals vs. 3.7 ml for controls (P less than 0.03). Phosphoramidon-treated animals were more reactive to dry gas hyperpnea compared with control (ES200 = 2.6 ml; P less than 0.0001). Methacholine dose-response curves (10(-11) to 10(-7) mol iv) obtained at the conclusion of the experiments were similar among capsaicin, phosphoramidon, and control groups. These findings implicate tachykinin release as an important mechanism of HIB in guinea pigs.
