In 100 out of 122 eyes obtained at autopsy, bacteria could be cultured in swabs taken from the conjunctivae. After individual storage of the excised corneas at +4 degrees C in a modified tissue culture medium containing 100 microgram/ml Gentalmicin, in 18 culture specimens there was still some growth of microorganisms. In comparison to nine other antibiotics, Gentamicin was the most effective against cultivated bacteria in a sensitivity test. However, in 25% of the specimens Ps.aeruginosa was resistant to Gentamicin. Polymyxin, to which Ps.aeruginosa was not resistant in the same test, should be used in combination with Gentamicin for antibiotic treatment of stored human donor corneas.
