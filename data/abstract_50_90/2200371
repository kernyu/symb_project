Resistance of the main causative agents of purulent septic infections such as pneumonia, meningitis, sepsis, etc. to 11 chemotherapeutic drugs was studied. The pathogens were isolated from autopsies of 203 newborns who died within 1981 to 1987. Among 2978 isolates belonging to Enterobacteriaceae (2466 strains) and Pseudomonadaceae (512 strains) which constituted 88% of all the isolates, strains with multiple resistance predominated: 90% of the strains resistant to 4 or more antibiotics, 77% of the strains resistant to 6 or more antibiotics and 48% of the strains resistant to 8 or more antibiotics. The highest number of the isolates were resistant to 8 and 9 chemotherapeutics (19 and 20%, respectively). 84% of all the isolates belonged to 4 genera: Klebsiella (34%), Escherichia (21%), Serratia (14%) and Pseudomonas (15%). They were characterized by the highest resistance spectra. In all the cases massive colonization of the intestine by the strains with multiple resistance which caused purulent septic infections was observed. The most frequent variants of the drug resistance combination were determined. In the total frequency of the isolate with multiple resistance no significant differences were detected in 1981 and thereafter. In 1986-1987 the frequency of S. marcescens strains increased 3-5 times with simultaneous broadening of their drug resistance spectra. Strains of S. marcescens and K. pneumoniae with multiple drug resistance endemic for definite hospitals were detected.
