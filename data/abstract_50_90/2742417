DNA of S. fradiae B-45 partially cleaved by Sau3A restrictase was cloned in S. lividans TK64 in the plasmid vector pIJ702. Three recombinant plasmids pVG251, pVG262, and pVG253 with tlr1, tlr2 and tlr3 genes were isolated from the transformed clones of S. lividans TK64 with higher inducible resistance to tylosin as compared to the plasmid-free strain. DNA-DNA blot hybridization was performed between the total DNA cleaved by several restrictases from S. fradiae B-45 and some other strains and the DNA probes containing the tlr genes. It was shown that tlr1 and tlr3 genes were unique in S. fradiae B-45. Sequences homologous to tlr2 gene were present both in DNA of S. fradiae B-45 in 7 copies and in strains of S. antibiotics and S. hygroscopicus producing respectively oleandomycin and turimycin.
