Protein synthesis in Escherichia coli mutants that differ from one another in mutations which impart streptomycin resistance was investigated by the application of hydrostatic pressure. Increased pressure resistance was only observed in mutants which exhibited reduced rates of peptide chain elongation. These findings indicate that the major effect of pressure on protein synthesis in E. coli may involve the S12 ribosomal protein.
