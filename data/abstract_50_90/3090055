The viability of isolated rat hepatocytes, as assayed by trypan blue exclusion, decreases in a dose-dependent fashion during exposure to hyperthermia (D0 [43 degrees C] = 105 +/- 10 min, D0 [45 degrees C] = 24 +/- 4 min). Hyperthermic sensitivity varies as a function of extracellular Ca2+ concentration in a biphasic manner; optimum survival occurs at 1-5 mM Ca2+, with sensitization in the absence of Ca+ and increasing sensitization at Ca2+ concentrations greater than 10 mM. Ca influx does not correlate well with loss of viability for hepatocytes in 4 mM extracellular Ca2+; influx does not occur until viability decreases to less than 1%. Under sensitizing conditions, Ca2+ influx proceeds loss of viability. Influx begins within 15 min at 45 degrees C in 15 mM Ca2+, and the ionophore A23187 is a potent hyperthermic sensitizer in the presence of extracellular Ca2+. Thus, Ca2+ influx, whether caused by high extracellular Ca2+ or A23187, increases cellular damage caused by supraoptimal temperatures, although some Ca2+ is necessary for maximum resistance, probably because of stabilization of Ca2+ binding proteins against thermal denaturation or possibly to Ca2+-induced decrease in lipid fluidity.
