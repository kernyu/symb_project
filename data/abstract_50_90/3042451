Nine strains of ETEC isolated in Italy have been compared with 13 isolates from Somalia with respect to toxin production, serotype and antimicrobial resistance pattern. None of the strains isolated from Italy belonged to any serotype or serogroups found among the strains from Somalia. Remarkable differences between the two groups of isolates were also observed with regard to the susceptibility to antimicrobials and the presence of R-plasmids. These findings suggest that ETEC strains isolated in Italy are not related to the strains widespread in Somalia and, generally, in developing countries.
