Cefotaxime, a new parenteral beta-lactamase-resistant cephalosporin, was tested against 78 cephalothin-resistant clinical isolates of Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas species. The anti-bacterial activity of the drug was compared with activities of cefazolin and cefuroxime and was found considerably more active. Most of the cephalothin-resistant strains were resistant to cephazin, too. The antipseudomonal activity of cefotaxime was found limited. The drug was found effective against 23 infections in hospitalized patients with only one clinical failure and two colonizations with cefotaxime-resistant bacteria. Cephalosporinases hydrolyzing cefotaxime were detected in two cefotaxime-resistant strains. Also, beta-lactamases hydrolyzing cefoxitin and cefuroxime were produced by the cefotaxime-resistant isolates studied.
