This paper presents a case of successful treatment of candida meningitis with miconazole. A 55-year-old woman was admitted due to high fever, vomiting and urinary incontinence on November 11, 1986. Four months prior to this episode, she had been treated for a ruptured aneurysm with neck-clipping and V-P shunt for NPH. Candida albicans was cultured from her CSF. The shunt system was immediately removed and an Ommaya's reservoir was installed for external drainage and intrathecal administrations. Combination therapy (amphotericin B and flucytosine) was initiated. However, it was discontinued after ten days because of high fever and chills after intrathecal injection of amphotericin B. Treatment with miconazole intrathecally (10-90 mg/week, total 565 mg) and intravenously (200-1200 mg/day, total 70.4 g) was begun on November 23. Clinical and CSF findings were improved soon. No side effect of miconazole was observed. After V-P shunt revision, she was discharged without neurological deficit on March 12, 1987. Reports of mycosis in central nervous system are recently increasing, especially for candidosis. Cryptococcosis is noted frequently as an opportunistic infection of AIDS. The administration of amphotericin B and flucytosine has been the main therapy for mycotic meningitis. Unfortunately, however, Amphotericin B has many toxic effects, including renal dysfunction, and flucytosine can induce the emergent resistance. Miconazole has been used to successfully treat cryptococcosis, aspergillosis or coccidiosis, and was effective in our case of candida meningitis. Few side effects have been reported with its use. The intrathecal injection of miconazole is recommended for meningitis, because the drug is taken up minimally into CSF space after intravenous administration.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
