We report the characterization of Tn2 transpositions into the chromosome and into an F' lacproB episome of E. coli. When Tn2 transposes into the chromosome a proportion of the insertions result in auxotrophy. These insertions can revert to prototrophs and lose ampicillin resistance concomitantly. However, Tn2 insertions in F' lacproB are often associated with deletions, and it seems probable that insertion and deletion occur simultaneously.
