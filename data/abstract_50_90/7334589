Cefroxadine (CXD) was applied to infectious diseases in children and the following results were obtained. 1. Serum concentration and urinary excretion: CXD was given orally in dose of 10 mg/kg in dry syrup from 30 minutes after meals. The peak serum concentration was at 1 hour after administration in 3 cases and at 2 hours in 1 case, and the average peak serum concentration was 16.41 microgram/ml in these 4 cases. The average urinary excretion rate of the antibiotic during 6 hours after administration was 93.9% in another 4 cases. 2. Antibacterial activity: The MIC of CXD against E. coli was slightly superior to that of CEX, but against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, Str. pyogenes, Str faecalis, Str. pneumoniae, Kleb. pneumoniae, Kleb. oxytoca, Pro. mirabilis, Pro, vulgaris, H. influenzae, H. parainfluenzae, H. parahaemolyticus the MICs of CXD were almost equal to those of CEX. 3. Clinical study: Thirty seven patients with bacterial infections (7 cases of urinary tract infection, 2 of cystitis, 10 of tonsillitis, 9 of scarlet fever, 7 of bronchitis and 2 of bronchopneumonia) were orally treated with CXD dry syrup, 15 approximately 48 mg/kg/day divided into 3 doses. The overall efficacy rate was 91.7%, and side effects inclusive of abnormal laboratory findings were not observed.
