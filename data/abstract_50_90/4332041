Interferon production in both susceptible S- and resistant K-line chickens infected with type II leukosis virus of JM strain and turkey herpesvirus was studied. The resistant line of chickens produced higher levels of interferon than did the susceptible with JM virus infection during the experimental period. When both susceptible S-and resistant K-line chicks were vaccinated with turkey herpesvirus, the interferon production was quantitatively similar in the two lines.
