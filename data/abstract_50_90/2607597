Cefodizime (CDZM), a new cephem antibiotic, was studied in terms of its pharmacokinetics and clinical efficacy in the field of obstetrics and gynecology, and the results are summarized as follows: Concentrations of CDZM in serum and genital tissues following 1 g drip infusion (30 min.) were determined and good penetration of CDZM into tissues was recognized. The maximum level in uterine arterial serum was 56.25 micrograms/ml and maximum tissue levels ranged 23.56-40.64 micrograms/g which were above its MIC80's for main pathogenic organisms. Peak concentrations of CDZM in pelvic dead space exudates following 1 g intravenous bolus injection or drip infusion ranged 6.25-6.52 micrograms/ml. The clinical efficacy of CDZM in 17 cases of obstetrical and gynecological infections was investigated using a dose of 1-3 g daily. The clinical efficacy rate was 88.2% (15/17 cases). Bacteriologically, the eradication rate was 83.3%. No side effects or abnormal laboratory test values were observed.
