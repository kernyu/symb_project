In river water samples 0.006...0.3% of total coliforms were detected as gentamicin resistant. Among gentamicin resistant coliforms most strains (86.5%) could be identified as Klebsiella. Most frequently a Gm-plasmid of about 150 Md was isolated harboring in Klebsiella oxytoca, K. pneumoniae and E. coli strains. All gentamicin resistant wild strains transferred the resistance to E. coli K-12. Most Klebsiella strains harbored several plasmids, R-plasmids and others. There were not any differences in plasmid profiles between sensitive and resistant strains.
