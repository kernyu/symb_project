The MICs of 21 antimicrobial agents were determined for 60 strains of Aeromonas spp. isolated from human feces. All isolates tested were susceptible to aztreonam, tetracycline, imipenem, moxalactam, pipemidic acid, gentamicin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, pefloxacin and ciprofloxacin. Resistance to erythromycin and streptomycin was observed in all 60 strains. Aeromonas caviae was less susceptible to cefamandole, cefotaxime, norfloxacin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim than was either Aeromonas hydrophila or Aeromonas sobria. It was concluded that cotrimoxazole or one of the newer quinolones can be considered for treatment of aeromonas-associated diarrhea.
