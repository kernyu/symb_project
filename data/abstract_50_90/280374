Thirteen cases of staphylococcal sub-mandibular lymphadenitis in children are presented and the diagnosis and treatment are discussed. All but one of the strains of Staphylococcus aureus isolated were resistant to penicillin, while the converse was true for erythromycin. Epidemic strains of Staphylococcus aureus were not found when bacteriophage typing was carried out on isolates from seven of the 13 patients.
