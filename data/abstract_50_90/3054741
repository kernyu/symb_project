A comparison between the MIC of amoxicillin (AMX) and ticarcillin (TIC) in the presence of clavulanic acid (Augmentin: AUG and Claventin: CLV) was made on 168 strains of Escherichia coli resistant to amoxicillin (MIC greater than 16 mg/l) and yet sensitive to ceftriaxone (MIC less than or equal to 4 mg/l) and 81 strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae sensitive to Ceftriaxone. All those strains have been isolated between 1986-87 in Bellevue Hospital in Saint-Etienne. On 168 Escherichia coli, 142 have a MIC greater than 128 mg/l of TIC. Those 142 Escherichia coli are sensitive or of an intermediary sensitivity to Cephalothin (MIC less than or equal to 32 mg/l) in 57% cases. Those 142 strains are sensitive to AUG (MIC less than or equal to 4 mg/l) in 13.4% cases, intermediary sensitive to AUG (4 less than MIC less than or equal to 16) in 30.3% cases, sensitive to CLV (CMI less than or equal to 16 mg/l) in 23.3% cases and intermediary sensitive to Claventin (16 less than MIC less than or equal to 64) in 47.2% cases. The 26 Escherichia coli of MIC less than or equal to 64 mg/l of TIC and resistant to Cephalothin (MIC greater than 32 mg/l) have MIC less than or equal to 4 mg/l of AUG In 3.8% cases and MIC less than or equal to 16 mg/l of Claventin in 79.6% cases.
