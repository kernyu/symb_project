The attachment site on the Bacillus subtilis chromosome for the lysogenic bacteriophage SPO2 has been mapped by PBS1-mediated transduction and was found to be between spc-2 and lin-2, showing 90% linkage to the former and 30% linkage to the latter marker. In the course of these studies the bry-2 marker was mapped between the cysA14 and str-1 loci.
