Several antibiotic resistance markers in Bacillus subtilis have been mapped by three-factor transduction crosses using bacteriophage PBS1. These markers, which are thought to be located in genes coding for ribosomal proteins, are within a segment comprising about 5 per cent of the B. subtilis genetic map, close to the major group of rRNA cistrons. The order of genetic makers in this region was found to be cysA14 mic-1 dagger str-1 (ery-1, ole-2) spc-2 bry-2 lin-2. The positions of neo-2, nea-1, and kan-2 are uncertain, although they are located in this region to the right of cysA14.
