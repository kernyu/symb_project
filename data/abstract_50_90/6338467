The new penicillins have not been a breakthrough for the pediatrician. Indeed, 20 years ago with the introduction of ampicillin and methicillin and 15 years ago with the introduction of carbenicillin, the pediatrician was given the penicillins that he has used so well to treat trivial and life-threatening infections. The drugs discussed in this article are small steps forward, and whether mezlocillin, azlocillin, or piperacillin will prove more helpful to the pediatrician than have carbenicillin or ticarcillin will be learned in the next few years.
