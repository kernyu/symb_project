R-factor 1818 (R-1818) had no effect on the efficiency of plating of ligase-deficient phage T4 mutants on strains of Escherichia coli containing excess, normal, or defective ligase. However, if the R(+) bacterial strain that overproduced ligase was first starved of thymine, its ability to propagate ligase-deficient phage was reduced by as much as fivefold compared with the burst size on the thymine-starved R(-) strain. In contrast, it was found that after ultraviolet irradiation of the host the phage burst size was higher on the R(+) ligase overproducing strain than the R(-) derivative. The maximal level of R-factor elimination produced by thymine starvation was inversely related to the ligase level of the host. Ultraviolet irradiation did not cure the R factor from strains containing wild-type levels of ligase, but did cause elimination from strains with excess or defective ligase. The results suggest that R-1818 codes for a nuclease that is induced by thymine starvation and which, possibly in conjunction with host-mediated nucleases, is responsible for its elimination under these conditions.
