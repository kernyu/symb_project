The antimicrobial activity of kanamycin, kanendomycin, gentamicin, amikacin, sisomicin, and dibekacin against 200 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was compared. Dibekacin was found to be the most active against the tested organisms, whereas the other aminoglycoside antibiotics fell in the following order of diminishing antibacterial potency: amikacin, sisomicin, gentamicin, kanendomycin, and kanamycin. Seven strains showed high-level resistance to gentamicin (minimal inhibitory concentration, 400 mug/ml), and two of them were also resistant to amikacin and sisomicin (minimal inhibitory concentration, 75 mug/ml). The minimal inhibitory concentration of dibekacin for these seven strains was 0.625 mug/ml.
