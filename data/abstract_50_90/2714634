The additional penicillin-binding protein (PBP 2') that is important in determining intrinsic resistance in methicillin-resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has been detected immunologically in strains from a variety of world-wide locations. This additional protein has also been definitively identified both immunologically and as a PBP in methicillin-resistant strains of S. epidermidis (MRSE). The assay described is rapid, specific and sensitive and has been used to detect PBP 2' in S. haemolyticus but not in beta-lactam resistant Streptococci.
