Rhizobium leguminosarum L4 is able to serve as a host for the plasmid RP1. Properties of R. leguminosarum [RP1] plasmid carrier suggest that the expression of RP1-coded Apr gene(s) is inhibited in this host, although the determinants of transfer and resistance to kanamycin and tetracycline are expressed. This system exemplifies a differential expression of plasmid genes in a new host.
