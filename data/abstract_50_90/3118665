Thirty male patients with gonorrheal urethritis were treated with norfloxacin (NFLX) at our urological ward between May and July, 1984, and clinically evaluated. Thirty-nine strains of Neisseria gonorrhoeae isolated from the clinical specimens of these patients were bacteriologically studied. Of the 39 strains, 3 (7.7%) were PPNG strains and the other 36 strains were non-PPNG strains. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of penicillin G, PCG to the 3 PPNG strains was 6.25-25 micrograms/ml and that to the 36 non-PPNG strains was 0.05-3.13 micrograms/ml. The MIC of NFLX to the PPNG strains was 0.025-0.1 microgram/ml and that to the non-PPNG strains was less than or equal to 0.0125-0.2 microgram/ml. The patients with gonorrheal urethritis were given NFLX orally for 3 days at a daily dose of 600 mg. The clinical efficacy rate was 100%: excellent in 12 and good in 18 cases. All 3 patients with gonorrheal urethritis caused by PPNGs were cured. No subjective side effects were found.
