Possible prevention of the nephrotoxic effect of different doses of aminoglycoside antibiotics, such as monomycin, kanamycin and gentamicin was studied experimentally on chinchilla rabbits. Substances increasing the cell resistance (sodium nucleinate, prodigiosan and pyrogenal alone and sodium nucleinate combinations with the bacterial polysaccharides) were used. It was shown that sodium nucleinate prevented nephrotoxicity of the aminoglycosides in the doses 2.5 times higher than the therapeutic ones. The combined use of sodium nucleinate with pyrogenal or prodigiosan was most effective. It prevented the nephrotoxic effect of the antibiotics in the doses 5 times higher than the therapeutic ones.
