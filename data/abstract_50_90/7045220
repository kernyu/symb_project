Salmonella typhimurium phage type DT 193 survived in small numbers, in stored static slurry derived from veal calves, for the 7-week period of observation. The viable coliform count fell by 1 1/2 logs during the first 2 weeks of storage, thereafter there were only relatively small fluctuations in the coliform population. In all 735 of 752 Escherichia coli isolates examined from eight samples of slurry were resistant to 3-6 antibacterial drugs. There was no dramatic change in the overall level of drug resistance amongst the E. coli with time. Chloramphenicol resistance was recorded in 400 (55%) of the E. coli. It was always associated with multiple resistance, with 96% of the strains being resistant to 5 or 6 drugs, although the proportion of isolates of each of the ten most prevalent O-serotypes resistant to chloramphenicol was variable and ranged between none and 97.5%. The use of biotyping together with O-serotyping indicated that the E. coli population was extremely complex, although certain components of the population remained relatively stable within the dominant flora with time since several of the more common O-serotype/biotype combinations were isolated from more than half of the eight slurry samples examined.
