Complexes of poly(C) with copolymers of inosinic acid containing various amounts of mismatched bases (see journal for formula) have been examined for direct resistance to virus infection, interferon induction and toxicity in two different cell cultures (primary rabbit kidney cells and mouse L-929 cells). Complexes in which 20% of the hypoxanthine bases were replaced by (see journal for formula) or ms-2I were partially active whereas complexes in which 40% or more of the hypoxanthine bases were replaced by the odd bases were entirely inactive. The decrease in biological activity observed upon intrusion of (see journal for formula) or ms-2I in the poly(I) strand of poly(I) with poly(C) closely paralleled the amount of odd bases introduced irrespective of the system employed to assess the biological activity (resistance to virus infection, interferon induction or toxicity).
