A new synthetic cephalosporin, cefotiam (CTM) was studied from the basic and clinical aspects, and the following results were obtained: 1. Bacteriological study: The bacterial activities of CTM against the clinical isolates of S. aureus, S. pyogenes, E. coli, Klebsiella sp. and Proteus sp. were compared with those of CEZ, CER, ABPC and GM. (1) As for S. aureus and S. pyogenes, the antibacterial actions of the conventional cephalosporins were slightly more potent than those of CTM. (2) However, CTM had the antibacterial actions which were most potent Proteus sp. among the above 4 antibiotics and more potent against E. coli and Klebsiella sp. than the above 2 conventional cephalosporins. 2. Pharmacokinetic study: The peak serum levels of CTM were comparatively low with 19.30 +/- 1.66 mcg/ml 30 minutes after a bolus injection of 20 mg/kg and 25.85 +/- 4.32 mcg/ml just after a drip infusion of 20 mg/kg. The half-life of the serum levels was 0.98 hrs. and 0.87 hrs., respectively. The 4 hours urinary excretions in six patients ranged from 38.6 to 64.9%, showing a slightly wide variance. 3. Clinical study: The clinical response was good in 23 out of total 25 cases, i.e. 14 cases with respiratory tract infection, 7 with urinary tract infection and 4 with skin and soft tissue infection. The response rate was 92%. Also, neither side effects nor abnormal laboratory findings was observed.
