A phosphonoacetate (PA)-resistant mutant of the herpesvirus of turkeys (HVT) was isolated and characterized. The mutant (HVTpa) replicates in growth medium containing 300 microgram/ml of PA and shows in vitro temperature sensitivity at 41 degrees C (its 37 degrees C/41 degrees C efficiency of replication is about 5). HVTpa replicates poorly in chickens and fails to provide complete protection against MDV challenge. The HVTpa-induced DNA polymerase has an apparent inhibition constant for PA 10 times as great, an apparent inhibition constant for pyrophosphate, twice as great, and an apparent Michaelis constant for dCTP 2.5 times as great as the respective figures for the HVTwt-induced enzyme. The HVTpa-induced enzyme is also more thermolabile.
