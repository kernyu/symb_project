A method for precise microscopic enumeration of acid-fast bacilli in the sputum of patients with pulmonary tuberculosis is described. The total number of acid-fast bacilli and the number of culturable cell units of tubercle bacilli per milliliter of sputum were determined in 269 specimens from 28 patients collected prior to and/or during chemotherapy, to establish the usefulness of the procedure for evaluation of the effects of chemotherapy. Prior to or very early in the course of therapy, there was good agreement between microscopically and culturally measurable bacilli in 27 of 28 patients. Thereafter, there were systematic divergences in five patients and occasional divergences in most others. Yet, in general, in 20 of the 28 patients, the microscopically determined population provided a useful measure of the number of culturable tubercle bacilli present. Although the microscopic procedure does not allow species identification of mycobacteria or differentiation between viable and nonviable cells, it often provided, within hours rather than days or weeks, useful information on the residual burden of acid-fast bacilli in sputum during chemotherapy. The nature of the disease in those patients in whom microscopy failed to provide useful information is discussed.
