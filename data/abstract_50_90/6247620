A cleavage map of Tn5, a kanamycin (Km) transposon from plasmid JR67, was constructed from pMKI, a composite plasmid of ColE1 and Tn5, and compared to that of Tn903, a Km transposon from plasmid R6-5. The two transposons showed marked heterogeneity in both the structural gene for Km resistance and the inverted repeat regions as evidenced by their distinctly different restriction maps. This result suggests separate paths of evolution for the two Km transposons.
