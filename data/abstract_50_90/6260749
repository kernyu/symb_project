Rts1 is a high-molecular-weight (126 x 10(6)) plasmid encoding resistance to kanamycin. It expresses unusual temperature-sensitive phenotypes, which affect plasmid maintenance and replication, as well as host cell growth. We have cloned the essential replication region of Rts1 from pAK8, a smaller derivative which is phenotypically similar to Rts1. Restriction endonuclease digests of isolated pAK8 deoxyribonucleic acid were allowed to "self-ligate" (ligation without an additional cloning vector) and subsequently were used to transform Escherichia coli strain 20SO to kanamycin resistance. Screening of these strains for the phenotypes of thermosensitive host growth and temperature-dependent plasmid elimination demonstrated that these two properties were expressed independently. Furthermore, it was shown that the Rts1 replication locus per se is not necessarily responsible for altered host growth at the nonpermissive temperature. The kanamycin resistance fragment of pAK8 was also cloned into pBR322. Electrophoretic analysis of BamHI restriction enzyme digests of this plasmid and similar digests of an Rts1 miniplasmid has allowed the identification of an 18.6-megadalton fragment carrying the replication locus and a 14.1-megadalton fragment carrying the kanamycin resistance gene.
