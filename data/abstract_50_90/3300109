Salmonella antibiotic-resistant strains, isolated from patients with hospital infections and from various environmental objects, showed lower virulence than antibiotic-sensitive strains in experiments on mice infected by intraperitoneal and enteral routes. Salmonella strains, sensitive to antimicrobial preparations, contained 1-2 plasmids, while those with multiple drug resistance contained 3-10 plasmids varying in their molecular weight. All these strains, with the exception of one laboratory strain, carried a plasmid with a molecular weight of about 60 Md. A decrease in the virulence of Salmonella strains, carrying R-plasmid, with respect to mice, their natural host, in experimental infection by the above-mentioned routes was probably unrelated to the loss of this plasmid. 80% of Salmonella strains with multiple resistance to antibiotics yielded positive results in the keratoconjunctival and conjunctival tests as compared with 42% of sensitive strains. These data suggest that Salmonella strains, carrying R-plasmid, retained pronounced capacity for local colonization.
