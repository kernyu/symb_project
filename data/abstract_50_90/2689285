The strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast with mutations in two genes NYS3 NYS4 were obtained by tetrad analysis. Sterol fraction of these mutants contains two sterols: ergosta-7-en-3 beta-ol (fungisterol) and ergosta-7,24-dien-3 beta-ol (episterol). The findings allowed to testify the sequence of the ergosterol biosynthesis reactions. Dehydrogenization of the sterol nucleus in C5(6) which is controlled by gene NYS3 occurs simultaneously with the introduction of double bond in C22(23) site of the side chain regulated by gene NYS4.
