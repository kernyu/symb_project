Sensitivity of 312 strains of staphylococci, 386 strains of streptococci and 1193 strains of aerobic gram-negative bacilli to the selected antibiotics was tested. These strains were isolated from the clinical material at the Clinical Hospital No. 1 in Warsaw within 1985-1986. Staphylococci were sensitive to pristinamycin, cefazolin, fusidic acid, oxacillin, and clindamycin. In 1986, a decrease in the number of strains sensitive to these antibiotics, except cefazolin, was seen. In case of streptococci the most active proved chloramphenicol and gentamicin but a significant decrease in the percentage of sensitive strains was also noted in 1986. The highest number of gram-negative bacilli was sensitive to amikacin, colistin, nalidixic acid, pipemidic acid, and gentamicin. In 1986, a decrease in the percentage of sensitive strains was noted. Amikacin and colistin were the most active against Pseudomonas spp. while amikacin and nalidixic and pipemidic acids--against Proteus spp. Comparison of the results with those obtained in 1981-1984 has shown that the sensitivity of staphylococci changed the most significantly and this change was unfavourable. Gentamicin and amikacin remained the most active against gram-negative bacilli while amikacin and colimycin against Pseudomonas spp. In case of anaerobes the majority of strains was sensitive to chloramphenicol, tetracycline and clindamycin. Metronidazole was active against high percentage of Clostridium spp. and all gram-negative bacilli while the percentage of gram-positive bacilli and cocci was sensitive to metronidazole.
