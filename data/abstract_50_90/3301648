Hybrid resistance of lethally irradiated (C57BL/6 X DBA/2)F1 and (C57BL/10 X C3H)F1 hybrid mice to the engraftment of parental C57BL/6 or C57BL/10 bone marrow cells is controlled by the H-2-linked Hh-1 locus. This resistance can be specifically blocked or inhibited by the injection of irradiated spleen cells from lethally irradiated, marrow reconstituted donor mice of certain strains. By testing the ability of regenerating spleen cells from various donor strains to block the resistance, we studied the genetic requirements for the expression of putative cell-surface structures recognized in hybrid resistance to H-2b marrow cells. Strains of mice bearing informative intra-H-2 or H-2/Qa-Tla recombinant haplotypes provided evidence that the Hh-1 locus is located telomeric to the H-2S region complement loci and centromeric to the H-2D region class I locus in the H-2b chromosome. Two mutations that affect the class I H-2Db gene have no effect on Hh-1b gene expression. The H-2D region of the H-2s haplotype contains an allele of the Hh-1 locus indistinguishable from that of the H-2Db region, as judged by the phenotypes of relevant strains and F1 hybrids. Collectively these data indicate that the Hh-1 locus is distinct from the class I H-2D (L) locus in the H-2b or H-2s genome, and favor the view that the expression or recognition of the relevant determinants is not associated with class I gene products.
