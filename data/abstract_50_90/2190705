The authors evaluate the comparative efficiency of chloroquine and amodiaquine (35 mg/kg during 3 days) for uncomplicated malaria treatment in an area with high chemoresistance level. 236 patients with malaria were examined and treated. 38% of them previously used antimalarials. The increase dosage in comparison with the WHO recommendations (25 mg/kg), lead to no advantages for chloroquine treatment (50% failure), in contrast with amodiaquine (4% failure). Therefore amodiaquine might be preferred in the health field unit for uncomplicated malaria.
