The frequency of isolation of Branhamella catarrhalis from sputum in a laboratory in the southern part of the Netherlands is reviewed; at present 23% of positive cultures contain these organisms. Seasonal variations include a considerable reduction in frequency of isolation in the summer months. The possible role of heavy industry and air pollution is briefly discussed. Evidence for the direct pathogenicity of B. catarrhalis is presented, and although this may be considered as only circumstantial it is still convincing, particularly in acute otitis media and in acute purulent exacerbations of chronic respiratory disease. The possibility of indirect pathogenicity through beta-lactamase production is discussed as is the evidence obtained by the use of several new antimicrobial agents which were subsequently shown to have been inappropriate.
