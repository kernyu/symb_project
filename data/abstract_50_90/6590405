Leukemia cells from patients with acute myeloid leukemia in relapse were treated with various inducers of differentiation of human myeloid leukemia cell lines. Leukemia cells in primary culture from most, but not all, patients underwent morphological, cytochemical and biochemical changes after treatment with inducers of differentiation such as 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), retinoic acid, actinomycin D, aclarubicin, and alkyl lysophospholipid. The most effective inducer varied from specimen to specimen. Leukemia cells from patients in relapse were compared with those from untreated patients. The responsiveness to TPA of leukemia cells from patients in relapse was similar to that of leukemia cells from untreated patients. However, retinoic acid or actinomycin D resistance was more frequently observed in leukemia cells from patients in relapse than in those from patients before initial therapy. This is the first report to indicate that leukemic cells from relapsed patients who are resistant to cytotoxic chemotherapeutic drugs can be induced to differentiate into mature cells by appropriate inducers. However, the responsiveness to inducers of leukemia cells from patients in relapse is not the same as that of leukemia cells before therapy.
