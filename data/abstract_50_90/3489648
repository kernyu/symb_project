Phenotypes of susceptibility to amoxycillin (Amo), ticarcillin (Tic), cephalothin (Ctn) were determined in 1366 isolates of Enterobacteriaceae by disk method and beta-lactamases were identified in 243 strains belonging to different phenotypes of amoxycillin-resistant strains. AmoR TicR CtnS strains (25%) were penicillinase producers and all of them were susceptible to the combination amoxycillin/clavulanic acid (Amo/CA) and ticarcillin/clavulanic acid (Tic/CA). Amo1/R TicS CtnR strains (12%) were cephalosporinase producers and resistance to Amo/CA was observed, except for Proteus vulgaris. AmoR TicR CtnR strains (18%) often produced two beta-lactamases (penicillinase and cephalosporinase) and they were resistant to Amo/CA; in this group, susceptibility to Tic/CA depends on the nature and the amount of the beta-lactamase produced, except for Serratia marcescens for which antibiotic resistance is probably due to other mechanisms. Tic/CA resistance was mainly found in Serratia marcescens (41%) and Enterobacter cloacae (36%).
