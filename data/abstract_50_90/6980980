A primary lung abscess due to non type B Hemophilus influenzae was diagnosed in three children who failed to improve after prolonged antibiotic treatment for dense, pneumonic infiltrates. In each instance percutaneous aspiration yielded pure cultures of Hemophilus influenzae, one of which was ampicillin resistant. Because of bronchial obstruction, operative drainage was necessary to effect cure in each case. Hemophilus influenzae has not previously been recognized as a cause of primary pulmonary abscess in childhood.
