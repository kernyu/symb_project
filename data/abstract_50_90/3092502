Thermal and chemical influences on microorganisms and the kinetics of microbicidal processes are described in terms suitable to define the resistance of microbes to heat and disinfectants resp. sterilisants. Interactions between active substances (e.g. disinfectants) and enzymes are formulated in equations, and the parameters of kinetics of inactivating enzymes (e.g. Ki-values) are derived. They permit a gradual evaluation of efficacy of microbicidal agents irrespective of their concentration.
