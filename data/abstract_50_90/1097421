The large mutant R-factor R1drd-19B2 gives rise to several classes of small, covalently closed circular deoxyribonucleic acids (DNAs), designated as Rsc DNAs, when harbored by the K-12 strain CRT46 which carries a dnaA mutation. The molecular weights of these DNA molecules range from 3 X 106 to 8.4 X 106. Cells arising from single colonies of CRT46-R1drd-19B2 harbor only one to two copies of the large mutant R-factor and in addition 10 to 20 copies of Rsc plasmid of a discrete size class per chromosome. The larger Rsc DNAs carry the ampicillin resistance gene. After transformation the small circular DNAs are present in Escherichia coli C in a large number of copies, up to 100 copies per chromosome. Hybridization studies between Rsc plasmids indicate that they possess common DNA sequences.
