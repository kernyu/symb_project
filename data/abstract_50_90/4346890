Adenosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate added to exponentially growing cells of Hemophilus influenzae strain Rd increases competence for transformation 100- to 10,000-fold. Cyclic AMP added to near-stationary or stationary cells does not increase competence over the high level normally found in the early stationary phase.
