We showed previously that the mouse fibroblastoid cell line Ltk-aprt- is resistant to the antiviral effects of beta interferon. This lack of response reflects a partial sensitivity to the interferon that is accompanied by a failure to activate expression of several interferon-regulated genes, although certain other genes respond in a normal manner. We show here that Ltk-aprt- cells were also unable to establish an antiviral state and to activate expression of 2,5-oligo(A) synthetase when treated with gamma interferon. Strikingly, however, treatment with a combination of beta interferon and gamma interferon provided complete protection against viral replication. Although the cells were completely insensitive to up to 250 U of the interferons per ml added singly, essentially complete protection from viral cytopathic effects was achieved when as little as 10 U of each of the interferons per ml were combined. Expression of 2,5-oligo(A) synthetase was also sensitive to this synergistic effect. Activation of an antiviral state could also be achieved by sequential treatment, first with gamma interferon and then with beta interferon. Partial protection against viral replication could be achieved by pretreatment with gamma interferon for as little as 1 h before incubation with beta interferon and could be blocked by the addition of specific antibodies or by cycloheximide, indicating that gamma interferon induces the synthesis of a protein which can act synergistically with a signal produced by the beta-interferon receptor. We suggest that Ltk-aprt- cells suffer from defects in one or more components of the gene activation pathways for both type I and type II interferons. Nonetheless, gamma interferon is able to activate the expression of a gene encoding a protein required for signal transduction. This protein acts synergistically with a transient signal produced in response to beta interferon, thereby activating the expression of a further group of genes.
