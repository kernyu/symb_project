During the period January 1969 through October 1973, rectal swabs from 13,947 diarrhea patients of all ages at infectious disease hospital and children hospital in Saigon were examined. From these specimens 610 strains of Salmonella of all group were isolated. A total of 46 serologic types were encounted. The most commonly encounted were S. paratyphi B, S. java and S. typhimurium (group B). Most of Salmonella isolated were obtained from adult gastroenteritis. We have also studied the possible relation between human and animal salmonellosis. The rodents trapped from different aera in Saigon, fish and clams collected from different markets were examined by bacteriological surveys. From these specimens, 42 strains of Salmonella were isolated for a 2,2 percent isolation rate. Our study showed that Salmonella types which were isolated frequently from animal were encounted in man.
