It was tested whether mutations induced in E. coli by N4-hydroxycytidine (oh4Cyd): (i) undergo mutation frequency decline (MFD) when synthesis of protein is arrested, and (ii) are influenced by polA1, polA107 or xth mutations. It was also investigated whether oh4Cyd may provoke SOS response and prophage lambda induction. All these processes may involve the action of repair enzymes. It has been shown that none of these processes or repair enzymes affects oh4Cyd-induced mutagenesis.
