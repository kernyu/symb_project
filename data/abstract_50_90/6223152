We administered piperacillin (PIPC), a semisynthetic penicillin antibiotic, to 11 patients with obstetrical and gynecological infections and obtained the following results. 1. PIPC was administered at a dose of 1 or 2 g by intravenous bolus injection or dripping infusion 1 or 2 times a day for a period of 3 approximately 8 days. The clinical effect was excellent in 5 cases and good in 6 cases and all the cases showed good effectiveness. These included good in 1 case of adnexitis, excellent in 3 cases and good in 1 case of intrauterine infections, excellent in 2 cases and good in 2 cases of pelvic inflammatory diseases and good in 2 cases of bartholinitis. Bacteriological findings indicated that S. faecalis, Staphylococcus, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, P. magnus, etc. isolated in 6 cases were eradicated after the administration of this drug. 2. Neither side effects nor abnormalities in laboratory findings caused by this drug were observed. 3. Based on these results PIPC should be considered a very safe and useful drug for treating obstetrical and gynecological infections.
