Enterobacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase bound fusidic acid with high affinity, but did not acetylate the drug at an experimentally detectable rate. The enzyme may therefore confer resistance to fusidic acid by sequestering the drug and thereby preventing the drug from binding to translational elongation factor G.
