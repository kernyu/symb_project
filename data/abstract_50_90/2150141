The resistance of methicillin-resistant staphylococci to phage 85 is due to the presence of a certain system restriction modification in microbial cells. The loss of the capacity for restricting phage DNA by the cell as the consequence of the loss of the mec determinant is not accompanied by the loss of its capacity for modifying phage DNA.
