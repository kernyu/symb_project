The data on the biological properties of the culture fluid of Streptococcus strain sp. TOM-1606 are presented. The native preparation has been shown to possess the capacity for stimulating the rate of the clearance of the peritoneal cavity of mice from Staphylococcus aureus cells, strain MT-1, rif. r., found to be insensitive to the action of the above-mentioned preparation in vitro. The crude preparation produces a transitory bacteriostatic effect on the streptococcal and staphylococcal strains under study. The preparation produces a prolonged bacteriostatic effect only on Micrococcus luteus test strain. All these data suggest that the crude preparation contains at least two active principles.
