A study was conducted at Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research, Pondicherry, India, on the pattern of antimicrobial utilization in hospitalized patients. A retrospective study was conducted during a one-month period between January 18 to February 17, 1987. The data were analyzed according to modified Kunin's criteria. The results were compared with a similar study conducted a decade ago. The study revealed a marked increase in the use of antimicrobial agents (from 19.9% to 56.1%). A more appropriate use of antimicrobial agents was observed (from 66.8% to 79.5%). A significant increase in their appropriate use for therapeutic purpose (50% to 88.2%), but not for prophylaxis (79.05% to 71.18%) was seen. The study revealed a marked increase in the use of antimicrobial agents during the last decade resulting in the emergence of nosocomial infections of resistant strains of organisms.
