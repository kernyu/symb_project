106 children aged 1-10 years who had pure Plasmodium falciparum infections and temperatures greater than or equal to 38 degrees C were treated with chloroquine base, 25 mg/kg body weight. 29% of the infections were sensitive in vivo, 41% recurred within 4 weeks (RI), 26% were RII resistant, and 4% were RII resistant. Rieckmann micro in vitro tests were successful in 64% of isolates obtained from these children; 63% were resistant to chloroquine. In 58 paired isolates obtained before and after treatment, the level of chloroquine sensitivity was lower in the parasites persisting or recurring after treatment. All children except 2 of the 4 with RIII resistance became afebrile an average of 1.4 d after starting treatment and their other symptoms resolved in an average of 1.8 d. By day 28, 57% of the children with RI resistance and 78% of those with RII resistance had recurrence of fever and other symptoms, compared with 19% of children with sensitive infections. No relationship was observed between the clinical or parasitological response and age, nutritional status, haematocrit, splenomegaly, presence of sickle-cell trait, or seropositivity to malaria by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The study demonstrates that, in most children with malaria in an area of intermediate chloroquine resistance, fever and other symptoms resolve at least temporarily when treated with chloroquine.
