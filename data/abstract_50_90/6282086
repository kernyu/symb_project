Pseudomonas aeruginosa was cultured in eight patients with premature rupture of membranes in a Maternity Unit of the University of Ife Teaching Hospital Complex within a period of 48 h. Three of the strains were found to harbour R-factor DNA conferring high-level resistance to benzylpenicillin, streptomycin, chloramphenicol and tetracycline, while two strains are able to transfer this drug resistance en bloc to drug-sensitive Escherichia coli. The significance of this in the light of a continuing study of drug resistant bacteria in Ile-Ife is discussed.
