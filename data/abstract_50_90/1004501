A rapid method suitable for purifying large amounts of mitochondria from rat liver using isopycnic zonal centrifugation is described. The RNA polymerase isolated from the purified mitochrondria was found associated with one peak when resolved by DEAE Sephadex chromatography. The enzyme was next fractionated on a phosphocellulose column followed by glycerol gradient centrifugation. A 600-fold purification was achieved when the enzyme was finally filtered through agarose gel. This final enzyme fraction consisted of one polypeptide chain as shown by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis profiles. The enzyme has a greater preference for poly [d(A-T)] templates than for rat liver mitochondrial DNA. Inhibition of the enzyme activity required high concentrations of the inhibitors. The resistance of the enzyme to alpha-amanitin indicated that there was no contamination from nuclear RNA polymerase II. The conclusion is drawn that the mitochondrial RAN polymerase activity is associated with a single polypeptide.
