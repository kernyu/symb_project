Aminoglycoside-resistance determinants in staphylococci are borne on conjugative and non-conjugative plasmids. The conjugative plasmids were found in methicillin-resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus isolated recently in Darwin and Sydney, Australia and in Houston, Texas, USA. These plasmids and the class-2 conjugative plasmid reported by Archer and Johnston (1983) had similar patterns of EcoR1 restriction-endonuclease fragments, encoded resistance to gentamicin, kanamycin and neomycin, transferred to a non-lysogenic recipient in conditions that promoted close cell-to-cell contact and mobilised a small, non-conjugative plasmid. A further plasmid, pWG14, encoding resistance to kanamycin, neomycin, streptomycin, erythromycin and lincomycin, also displayed conjugative properties but did not mobilise the small, non-conjugative plasmid. The transfer frequency of all conjugative plasmids was stimulated by the addition of polyethylene glycol, particularly at concentrations above 20%, to mixtures of donor and recipient broth cultures. Polyethylene glycol appeared to promote close cell-to-cell contact between donor and recipient cells. A representative of the most common aminoglycoside-resistance plasmids in Australian isolates of methicillin-resistant S. aureus was non-conjugative and transferred by a bacteriophage-mediated system to a lysogenic recipient. With the exception of plasmid pWG14, the conjugative plasmids were also transferred by a bacteriophage-mediated system. Furthermore, cultural conditions that favoured conjugative transfer of plasmids inhibited bacteriophage-mediated transfer and vice versa. The efficacy of the two transfer systems for analysing the plasmids of gentamicin-resistant, methicillin-resistant isolates of S. aureus has been compared.
