A new antibiotic drug of cephalosporin, with marked resistance to beta-lactamase, cefoperazone (CPZ) for parenteral use was used in 6 patients with acute peritonitis and perforated appendicitis. CPZ in a dose of 1 g was given intravenously during the operation. Tissue specimens of different sites were taken from removed organs. The materials of purulent ascites and appendix were subsequently taken at intervals. Determination of CPZ concentration was performed according to paper disk bioassay with Micrococcus luteus ATCC 9341 strain. CPZ concentration in purulent ascites increased quickly after injection, and reached high level peak at 30 minutes to 1 hour, then they were very slowly declined. CPZ concentration in the infected appendix, was directly proportional to the degree of pathological changes of inflammation. CPZ concentration in serious gangrenous appendix reached to 50.3 mcg/g at 20 minutes after intravenous injection, and increased to 54.3 mcg/g at 30 minutes, 60.3 mcg/g at 38 minutes, respectively. On the CPZ concentration in patients with appendicitis, the concentration in purulent ascites and appendix were observed higher than the MIC of CPZ for Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae bacilli. CPZ therefore will be a very useful drug when used for chemotherapy of acute peritonitis.
