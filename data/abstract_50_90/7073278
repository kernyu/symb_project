Mycobacterium chelonei-like organisms have been isolated from patients in two outbreaks of peritonitis involving chronic peritoneal dialysis machines routinely disinfected with 2 to 3% formaldehyde. Susceptibility studies revealed that water-adapted M. chelonei-like organism strains could survive 2 h of exposure to 10% formaldehyde.
