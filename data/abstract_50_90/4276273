The antibiotic sensitivity pattern of 3872 isolates of N. gonorrhoeae tested in Toronto from 1969 to 1973 is reviewed. An increase in resistance to both penicillin and tetracycline was noted up to 1971, but no further increase has occurred since then. Ninety-seven percent of 135 patients with "sensitive" strains (inhibited by 0.3 U/ml of penicillin and/or 0.5 mug/ml of tetracycline) were cured by either 8 g of tetracycline or 5,000,000 U of penicillin, whereas only 59% of 58 patients with "resistant" strains (requiring 1.0 U/ml of penicillin and/or 2.0 mug/ml of tetracycline for inhibition) were cured by the same dosage. Spectinomycin appears to be an acceptable alternative therapy. Maximum doses of the chosen drug are recommended in the hope of retarding further spread of more resistant organisms.
