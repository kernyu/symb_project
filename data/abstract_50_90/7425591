Chemotherapy and chemoprophylaxis play a significant role in control of various infectious diseases. The use of chemotherapeutic drugs is associated with a number of difficulties, such as development of drug resistance in pathogenic microorganism during the treatment, possible toxic effects of drugs on their prolonged use, inefficiency of chemotherapy in bacteria carriers, etc. In spite of the achievements in chemotherapy of acute bacterial infections, tuberculosis, lepra, mycoses, protozoal infections, it is necessary to have available new drugs for the treatment of these diseases. The achievements in chemotherapy of viral infections are relatively modest. However, therapy of such infections is of great importance for medicine. Highly effective broad-spectrum antiviral agents may play a significant role in the control of widely spread viral diseases of man and cattle. Such drugs will be of great significance in prevention of complications in persons with viral infections and studying the diseases of supposed viral etiology. For the successful solution of the problems of chemotherapy, a proper strategy in the development of the research work in this field is of importance.
