MK-0787 (Imipenem)/MK-0791 (Cilastatin sodium), a new compound of Thienamycin, was administered in treatment of 35 patients (36 cases) with chronic complicated UTI or for prevention of serious infections with much complicated factors. The patients were principally treated at a daily dose of 1 g for over 10 days. The efficacy rate of 26 patients who were evaluable in the early phase (4-7 days) was 88.5%, while it became up to 92.3% in the final phase judgment. As for clinical usefulness, the result was obtained to be as high as that of the clinical efficacy. In bacteriological study, 35 strains were clinically isolated including 7 strains of P. aeruginosa from UTI. All the strains disappeared with an eradication rate of 100% after treatment. Strains appearing after Imipenem/Cilastatin sodium treatment mainly consisted of fungi. Usefulness judgements tended to be greater in the final phase than in the early phase. As for side effects, vomiting was recorded in one case, in which the administration was discontinued. In laboratory findings there were 3 cases with elevated GPT, 2 cases with elevated GOT, one case with elevated gamma-GTP, one with thrombocytopenia, and one with eosinophilia each, but these abnormal values were slight and transient. In summary our clinical study showed that Imipenem/Cilastatin sodium was a very effective antibiotic in treatment on moderate or serious UTI or preventive use for infections in compromised hosts. Considering the features of this agent, it might be more effective and useful for clinical use in treatment on polymicrobial infections including stubborn organisms than any other antimicrobial compounds. Furthermore, it was safe and well tolerable in a long term treatment.
