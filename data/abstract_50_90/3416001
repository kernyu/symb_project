Resistance changes were measured on artificial membranes made of oxidized cholesterol and treated with nystatin. The experimental data were smoothed and then fitted to a mixture of Gaussian functions using the maximum likelihood method; the best fit was to a mixture of four gaussians centered approximately at 4, 6, 9 and 12 molecules per pore, leading to the conclusion that these are the most likely pore sizes.
