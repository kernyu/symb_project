This study evaluates a new direct rapid system for urine cultures, including detection and quantitation of positive specimens by Gram stain, direct identification by 4--6-hour incubation of sediment with reagent strips, and antibiotic susceptibility testing by direct (3--4-hour) disk-elution methods. Of 987 routine urine specimens, 121 had significant (less than or equal to 10(5) colony-forming units/ml) gram-negative bacilluria, of which 89% were detected by the Gram stain. Direct rapid identification was correct in 94%. Results of direct disk-elution antimicrobial tests showed overall agreement with results of standard disk diffusion of 93% of tests, and major discrepancies in 4%. For urine specimens with gram-negative bacilluria, this system permitted detection, quantitation, identification, and antimicrobial susceptibility testing in four to six hours with reasonable, though not complete, accuracy.
