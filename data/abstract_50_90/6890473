Properties of the elongation factor Tu from Lactobacillus brevis which is naturally insensitive to kirromycin are described. The protein is characterized by an unusual nucleotide-binding site with increased affinity for GTP and extreme heat stability. EF-Tu is sensitive to pulvomycin in the assay of polyphenylalanine synthesis. However, the failure of the protein to display pulvomycin-dependent GDP-binding and GTPase activity indicates that pulvomycin action in L. brevis differs from that in E. coli.
