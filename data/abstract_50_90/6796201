Administration of glutaraldehyde treated L1210 leukemia cells, either alone or coupled with tetanus toxoid by means of glutaraldehyde as well as L1210 cells inactivated by mitomycin, did not induce appreciable protection against a tumorigenic dose of L1210 cells. On the other hand, injection of P40 fraction of C. granulosum induced non-specific resistance to L1210 leukemia and increased the efficiency of specific immunization by either glutaraldehyde treated L1210 cells or cells coupled with tetanus toxoid. Injection of Freund's complete adjuvant resulted in increase of rate of mortality after challenge with L1210 cells.
