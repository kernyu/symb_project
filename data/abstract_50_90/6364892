While cyclandelate is widely used in the therapy of peripheral arterial disease, objective evidence of its efficacy remains controversial. For this reason, 12 patients with intermittent claudication (average age of 66.8 years) received both cyclandelate 400 mg qid and placebo in a double-blind crossover trial lasting two months. During the cyclandelate and placebo periods, the following peripheral hemodynamic measurements were obtained using a plethysmograph and treadmill claudication testing: mean calf blood flow, vascular resistance and venous capacitance; finger and toe blood flow, pulsation amplitude and temperature before and after vasodilating maneuvers; arm and leg arterial pulsation amplitudes, one and ten minute calf reactive hyperemia reaction; 30 pound/30 second calf active hyperemia reactions and times of onset of claudication as measured on a treadmill. No major significant difference could be demonstrated between placebo and cyclandelate on any subjective symptom or any objective measurement. It is concluded that cyclandelate 400 mg qid for 4 weeks was of little objective value in treating this group of 12 patients with peripheral arterial disease and suffering from intermittent claudication.
