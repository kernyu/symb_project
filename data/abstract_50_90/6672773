The interaction of DAPI with natural and synthetic polydeoxynucleotides of different base content and sequences was studied with circular dichroism, ultracentrifugation, viscosity and calorimetry. All the polymers show two types of binding. The strength of the interaction and its resistance to ionic strength are related to the content of AT clusters in the chain. On the other hand, sedimentation measurements rule out an intercalation mechanism. A model of DAPI interaction with DNA, similar to that displayed by distamycin and netropsin, is proposed.
