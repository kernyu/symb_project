An outbreak of equine salmonellosis occurred at the Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital, University of California, Davis, between June 1981 and March 1982. Forty-four horses were infected with Salmonella saint-paul, a serotype rarely isolated from animals at the university before the outbreak. Unlike the isolates of S saint-paul obtained at the beginning of the outbreak, almost all strains isolated near the end were resistant to ampicillin, cephalothin, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, kanamycin, sulfadiazine, trimethoprim, and trimethoprim-sulfadiazine. A conjugal-resistance plasmid (R-plasmid) was responsible for resistance to these antimicrobics. This R-plasmid was identical to an R-plasmid of S krefeld, a serotype that had been isolated repeatedly throughout the hospital before, during, and after the outbreak involving S saint-paul. This finding prompted the suggestion that in vivo transfer of the R-plasmid had occurred. Whether the donor organism was S krefeld is unknown.
