To facilitate genetic analysis of Candida albicans natural variants, we have isolated a dominant mycophenolic acid-resistant mutant. Mycophenolic acid-resistant auxotrophs were used to analyze prototrophic natural variants by spheroplast fusion. The fusion products were shown to be heterozygous for many of the parental chromosomes by molecular and genetic criteria. Using this approach, we have found that one type of morphologic variation is due to a recessive change and identified three dominant 5-fluorocytosine-resistant mutants. Rare fusion products express recessive parental markers. These exceptional progeny should be useful for linkage analysis and strain construction.
