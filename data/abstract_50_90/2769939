Metabolism of (+-)-7-(3-amino-1-pyrrolidinyl)-6-fluoro-1-(2,4-difluorophenyl)-1,4- dihydro-4- oxo-1,8-naphthyridine-3-carboxylic acid p-toluenesulfonate hydrate (T-3262) was studied. Metabolites were isolated from urine of mouse, rat, rabbit, dog and monkey following oral administration of T-3262, and identified using high performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. Two metabolites, other than unchanged (+-)-7-(3-amino-1-pyrrolidinyl)-6-fluoro-1-(2,4-difluorophenyl)-1,4- dihydro-4-oxo-1,8-naphthyridine-3-carboxylic acid (T-3262 base), in which 3-aminopyrrolidinyl ring of T-3262 was metabolized, were identified as: (+-)-7-(3-acetyl-amino-1-pyrrolidinyl)-1-(2,4-difluorophenyl)-6-fluoro- 1,4- dihydro-4-oxo-1, 8-naphthyridine-3-carboxylic acid (T-3262A) in all animals: (+-)-1-(2,4-difluorophenyl)-6-fluoro-7-(3-hydroxy-1-pyrrolidinyl)-1,4- dihydro- 4-oxo-1,8-naphthyridine-3-carboxylic acid (T-3262B) in monkey. The glucuronide of T-3262 was detected in mouse, dog and monkey, the glucuronides of T-3262A and T-3262B were detected in monkey. M-I, unidentified metabolite, was detected only in mouse.
