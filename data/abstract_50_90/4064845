This report describes a rapid and sensitive procedure for detection of cytosine arabinoside- (Ara-C) resistant mouse leukemia cells (L1210) in a predominantly Ara-C-sensitive population. L1210 cell lines sensitive or resistant to Ara-C were grown and treated with Ara-C in vitro or in vivo. Ara-C-resistant cells were detected as those cells with S-phase DNA content retaining the ability to incorporate bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) after treatment with Ara-C. The BrdUrd incorporation ability of the S-phase cells was assessed by simultaneous flow cytometric measurement of cellular DNA content and amount of incorporated BrdUrd. The proportion of Ara-C-resistant cells was accurately estimated at frequencies approaching 10(-3).
