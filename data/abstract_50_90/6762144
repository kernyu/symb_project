pKMR-plasmids controlling the antibiotic resistance and adhesive properties were isolated from clinical strains of E. coli O26 and O124, and Sh. sonnei. Two of them, i.e. pKMR 207 and pKMR 208 were conjugative. On conjugation they jointly transferred the features of the antibiotic resistance and capacity for production of the colonization antigen. The studies on transformation of E. coli K 12 802 with the plasmid DNA of E. coli O124 showed that the antibiotic resistance and colonization properties in E. coli O124 were controlled by the nonconjugative plasmid pKMR 209. It was found that plasmids pKMR 207 and pKMR 208 had the fi(-)-phenotype. None of the plasmids allotted the host cells sensitivity to the donor specific phages of the incompatibility groups F, N, P, W, and I. Probably, the plasmids did not belong to these incompatibility groups. When the cells of E. coli K 12 802 were transformed with the plasmid DNA of the wild strain to the hemolytic strain of S. typhimurium with multiple antibiotic resistance, 3 pKMR 210 plasmids with different markers of the antibiotic resistance were detected in the transformants. One of the plasmids controlled both the drug resistance and the capacity for production of hemolysin. The ability of the detected pKMR plasmids to inhibit fertility and relation to the donor specific phages was studied.
