Natural strains of actinomycetes belonging to 3 systematic groups of the Streptomyces genera, i.e. blue, gray and globisporine were characterized for their resistance to antibiotics and sulfamids. The majority of the strains were shown to have stable inherited multiple resistence to a wide variety of antibiotics. Linkage analysis for resistance determinants in pairs showed random distribution of most of the determinants among the members of the blue and grey groups of the actinomycetes. Non-random distribution of the resistance determinants to Tc, Cm and Rm in TcCm, TcRm conbinations for the blue group actinomycetes and to Om, Rm, Fa, Lm, Em, Rm and Tc in OmRm, FaLm, EmPm, TcOm combinations among the members of the grey group of actinomycetes was found.
