Woody-Karrer, Pearl (Palo Alto Medical Research Foundation, Palo Alto, Calif.), and Joseph Greenberg. Resistance and cross-resistance of Escherichia coli S mutants to the radiomimetic agent proflavine. J. Bacteriol. 87:536-542. 1964.-All 50 of the first-step mutants of Escherichia coli S selected for resistance to proflavine were resistant to ultraviolet light and each of five different radiomimetic chemicals. The mutants were classified into eight types on the basis of their relative resistance to six different radiomimetic drugs and on the basis of the shape of their ultraviolet survival curves. Three of these types are identical to types previously isolated with other radiomimetic drugs; five of the types are new. A high proportion of the clones surviving proflavine treatment were phenotypically but not genetically resistant, and no strains were isolated which were resistant to proflavine but were not resistant to radiation.
