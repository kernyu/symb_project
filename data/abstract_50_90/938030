The sensitivity of different microorganisms, considered as typical representatives of the microflora of soil and water, was established to evaluate the influence of the nonmedical use of antimicrobial agents on bacterial ecology. Only seven strains, six chemoorganotrophs and one chemolithotroph, could be considered as relatively sensitive to the 21 antimicrobial compounds tested. The other 29 microorganisms may be regarded as resistant to most antimicrobial agents. Streptomyces were sensitive to high concentrations of active substances. Broad-spectrum antibiotics showed an effect on environmental bacteria similar to that on human pathogens. Cephalothin stimulated the growth of a Chlorella sp. From these experiments, it appears that spilled antimicrobial agents have little chance of causing an alteration in the microbial ecology.
