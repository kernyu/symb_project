Primary exposure to Trichinella spiralis in the rat, while immunizing against reinfection, induces changes in the carbohydrate structure of intestinal brush border membranes. Immunity is expressed in heightened resistance to mucosal invasion by L1 larvae, and the change in structure is evident in reduced membrane binding of the lectin, wheat germ agglutinin. The possibility that altered membrane composition is a requisite for expression of immunity was hypothesized and this was evaluated by correlating the maximum, specific binding of wheat germ agglutinin by isolated brush border membranes with (1) the expression of immunity acquired passively through serum transfer, and (2) the loss of immunity acquired from serial infections terminated in the intestinal phase. The hypothesis was further evaluated by determining whether the change in membrane structure represents a stimulus-specific response. We observed that (1) passively acquired immunity was not associated with a reduction in lectin binding and (2) short-term exposure to the intestinal stages of T. spiralis led to a reduction in lectin binding that was detectable at a time when rats were incapable of resisting reinfection. The change in lectin binding associated with trichinosis also accompanied infection with Nippostrongylus brasiliensis. Results uniformly support the conclusion that immunity to T. spiralis is independent of brush border membrane changes reflected in reduced binding of wheat germ agglutinin.
