Longterm therapy of chronic bacterial bronchitis assumes two forms: (a) therapy of acute exacerbations, and (b) continuous longterm prophylaxis, chiefly during the 4-7 winter months. Longterm prophylaxis should be confined exclusively to patients with two or more severe annual exacerbations. The commonest pathogens, Haemophilus influenzae and pneumococci, are usually sensitive to ampicillin and amoxycillin, cotrimoxazole (Bactrim or Eusaprim) and tetracyclines.
