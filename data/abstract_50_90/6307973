A tetracycline resistance plasmid of Streptococcus faecalis, pAM alpha 1, is shown to contain two independent sets of replication functions, separated from each other on either side by short (300- to 400-base-pair) sequences of homology. The homologous sequences are oriented as direct repeats and therefore permit the dissociation of pAM alpha 1 into its component replicons, referred to here as pAM alpha 1 delta 1 and pAM alpha 1 delta 2, as the reciprocal products of a simple intramolecular recombination. pAM alpha 1 delta 1 is a 4.6-kilobase plasmid which carries the tet gene, and pAM alpha 1 delta 2 is a 5.1-kilobase plasmid which carries no known selectable marker. pAM alpha 1 delta 1 is shown to replicate efficiently in Bacillus subtilis and to confer tetracycline resistance on Bacillus hosts. We demonstrate by restriction mapping analysis that pAM alpha 1 delta 1 is virtually identical to a 4.6-kilobase tetracycline resistance plasmid of Bacillus cereus, pBC16, which is known to show extensive homology to plasmid isolates from Staphylococcus species (such as pUB110), as well as from other Bacillus species. The pAM alpha 1 delta 1-pBC16-pUB110 replicon thus exists naturally in at least three different gram-positive genera, indicating that these plasmids have a high degree of interspecific functional adaptability and supporting the view that plasmid DNA is commonly exchanged among many species of gram-positive bacteria in their natural environments.
