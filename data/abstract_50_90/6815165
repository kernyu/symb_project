The processing of damaged DNA was altered in a mitomycin C-sensitive mutant (mtcA) of Micrococcus radiodurans. Even though the mutant retained resistance to 254-nm UV radiation, it did not, in contrast to the wild-type strain, show any excessive DNA degradation or cell death when incubated with chloramphenicol after sublethal doses of either UV light or mitomycin C. The results suggest the constitutive synthesis of an enzyme system responsible for wild-type proficiency in the repair of mitomycin C-induced damage. An alternative system able to repair damage caused by mitomycin C was demonstrated in the mtcA background. In this strain, additional damage inflicted upon the cellular DNA effected a massive rescue of cells previously inactivated by mitomycin C. Rescue was provoked by ionizing radiation, by UV light, or by simple alkylating agents. Cells treated with psoralen plus near-UV radiation could be rescued only when inactivation was due primarily to psoralen-DNA interstrand cross-links rather than to monoadducts. The rescue of inactivated cells was prevented in the presence of chloramphenicol. These results can be interpreted most readily in terms of an alternative repair system able to overcome DNA interstrand cross-links produced by mitomycin C or psoralen plus near-UV light, but induced only by the more abundant number of damages produced by radiation or simple alkylating agents.
