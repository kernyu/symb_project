Seventeen patients, who were fitted with a continuous-wear hydrophilic lens for 12 weeks, received topical neomycin sulfate-polymyxin B sulfate-gramicidin (Neosporin) eyedrops in one eye only at a frequency of 3.7 times per day. The continuous wear of a hydrophilic lens in and of itself did not after normal bacterial flora, and the use of the antibiotic drops did not alter normal conjunctival flora. In addition, the eyedrops were not more effective when used in conjunction with the hydrophilic lens and did not appear to produce resistant organisms during the 12-week study. In normal eyes, a continuously worn hydrophilic soft contact lens that is well tolerated does not adversely affect the bacterial flora and the addition of neomycin sulfate-polymixin B-gramicidin drops at a frequency of 3.7 times per day does not appear to be beneficial or necessary.
