The Importance of Antibiotic Prophylaxis for Surgery: The current state of the discussion of the benefits and dangers of antibiotic prophylaxis in surgery is critically considered with reference to the literature and our own investigations. Situations where prophylactic administration of antibiotics may be absolutely locigal and where such administration may be without benefit to the patient or even dangerous are commented on. "Shortterm prophylaxis" where antibiotics are given before, during and after the operation for a short period of 24 to 48 hours is particularly discussed. If antibiotics are given they must be effective against the pathogen in question and they must be present in sufficiently high concentrations at the possible sites of infection.
