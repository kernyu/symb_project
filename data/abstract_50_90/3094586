The resistance to proteolysis by pepsin of gastric mucus glycoprotein synthesized by tissue culture in the presence and absence of 0.1 M ethanol was investigated. The glycoprotein product of ethanol-supplemented culture was found to contain 68% less associated lipids and 81% less covalently bound fatty acids, but exhibited unaltered content of carbohydrate and protein. The lipid and fatty acyl deficient glycoprotein was 5-times more rapidly and 2-3-times more extensively degraded by pepsin than the glycoprotein synthesized in the absence of ethanol. Following delipidation with organic solvents and deacylation with hydroxylamine both glycoproteins were digested at the same rate and degraded to the same extent. The lower content of fatty acyl residues markedly affected the overall pattern of the proteolytic fragments identified by SDS gel electrophoresis. The peptides corresponding to the acylated fragments of control were degraded and an increase in the amount of smaller peptides was observed. The in vitro assays of the fatty acyltransferase activity towards the substrates obtained from control and alcohol-containing cultures revealed that the enzyme activity was similar and increased proportionally with increased concentration of both glycoprotein substrates and enzyme. However, addition of 0.1 M ethanol to the assay tubes containing complete incubation mixture decreased the acylation of either glycoprotein by 40%. Based on the results presented here, and on previous studies of mucus glycoprotein synthesis in the presence of ethanol, we conclude that ethanol interferes with the process of acylation of mucus glycoprotein with fatty acids.
