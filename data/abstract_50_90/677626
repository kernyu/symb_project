An analysis is made of the usefulness of various antibiotics in the systemic treatment of bacterial endophthalmitis. The staphylococcus is a common causative organism, particularly in cases following ocular trauma. Methicillin is the drug with which ophthalmic investigators have had the most experience, and is an acceptable therapeutic choice in the treatment of gram-positive endophthalmitis. Oxacillin has not been shown to penetrate the blood-aqueous barrier, and should not be used systemically. Dicloxacillin, currently not available for parenteral administration, is the penicillinase-resistant penicillin of choice. Cephalothin penetrates the eye well, but satisfactory levels are not maintained for a sufficient length of time. Cephaloridine, with excellent intraocular penetration and gram-negative coverage, may well be the optimal drug in patients with normal renal function.
