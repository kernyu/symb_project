We report a case of a patient undergoing hemodialysis who developed a wound infection and subsequently bacteremia with a strain of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus identified as Enterococcus gallinarum. He had been receiving vancomycin prophylaxis before developing these infections. Both isolates were susceptible to ampicillin, rifampin, teicoplanin, and daptomycin (LY146032).
