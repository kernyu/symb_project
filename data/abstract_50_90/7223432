V. alginolyticus from environmental sources of different geographical areas and some human pathogenic strains were investigated for their sensitivity to 29 different antimicrobial agents, using the agar diffusion method. All strains were sensitive to Gentamicin, Neomycin, Sulfaisodimidin, Sulfamethoxazole-Trimethoprim, Rifamycin, Nalidixan and Linco-Spectin and all except one to Trimethoprim, Tetracycline, Chloramphenicol, Nitrofurantoin and Tobramycin. Between 80 and 94% of tested strains were sensitive to Clindamycin, Cephalotin, Kanamycin, Tylosin and Spiramycin, while Ampicillin, Vancomycin and Novobiocin were effective to approximately 50%. A high percentage of resistance was found to Meticillin, Carbenicillin and Lincomycin. All strains were resistant to Penicillin and Fucidin. No variation in sensitivity pattern between environmental strains isolated from different areas was detected. Great correlation was found among environmental and human pathogenic strains, which could be helpful as guidance in therapy.
