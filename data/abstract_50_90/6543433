The antibacterial activity in vitro of aztreonam is compared with other antibiotics on 1,030 strains isolated from pathological specimens. Its spectrum is very large, with special regard to Gram-negative bacteria. Of particular interest appears the sensitivity to aztreonam of otherwise multiresistant strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus rettgeri.
