Owners of 116 farms, whose flocks had been tested for anthelmintic resistance, were interviewed to determine their use of various sheep management and parasite control practices and their knowledge and adoption of recommended procedures for the prevention and control of resistance. Farmers knowledge of current recommendations related mainly to changing drenches and drench groups. Other aspects of the recommended program including reduction of drenching frequency and the use of alternative management strategies were not considered as important by farmers. For most questions a high proportion of farmers (greater than 20%) had no opinion. Associations between various strategies for nematode control and resistance of Trichostrongylus and Teladorsagia to thiabendazole and levamisole were examined. These relationships differed between anthelmintics and nematode genera. A number of factors were related to resistance of one or both nematode genera to one or both anthelmintic groups. These factors included flock size, percentage of ewes in the flock, cattle number, main sheep production activity, grazing strategy, frequency of drenching, changes in the frequency of drenching, number of summer drenches and the method of estimating dose rates. It was concluded that the methods employed to control anthelmintic resistance may vary with the nematode, its resistance status and the anthelmintic to which it is exposed. Modifications to the previously recommended program have been proposed which incorporate selection of the anthelmintic to be used following a test for anthelmintic resistance.
