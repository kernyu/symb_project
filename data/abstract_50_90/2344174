A total of 94 clinical isolates of the Bacteroides fragilis group was tested for susceptibility to metronidazole, chloramphenicol, clindamycin, cefoxitin, cefotetan, cefmetazole, moxalactam, mezlocillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, and imipenem. All the strains tested were susceptible to imipenem, metronidazole, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, and chloramphenicol. The rate of resistance to clindamycin was 21%. The results of this study demonstrate a difference in resistance rates from one species of the B. fragilis group to another.
