Cefoxitin (CFX) administered to 15 hospitalized patients with postoperative infections mainly caused by Gram negative rods. Out of 15 cases treated with CFX, 11 cases showed excellent or good response. CFX was ineffective in only 1 case infected with P. mirabilis, Enterobacter and S. faecalis. Bacteriological findings revealed that CFX was highly effective against E. coli, Klebsiella, P. morganii and Neisseria, and antibacterial activity of CFX was equal or slightly superior than those of ABPC and CEZ, however, CFX was less effective against Enterobacter and S. faecalis. No side effect was observed during the course of therapy with CFX.
