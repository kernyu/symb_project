In recent years widespread circulation of salmonella and shigella strains resistant to multiple antibiotics has become an international problem. Accordingly the bacterial sensitivity to a range of antibiotics has been assessed in vitro and recorded for the period 1979-83 for patients from the Al Qassimi Hospital. A total of 229 enteric pathogens from 148 children and 59 adult patients were isolated and studied. Most of the enterobacteria were sensitive to colistin, gentamicin, trimethoprim and chloramphenicol (Salmonella typhi approached 100% sensitivity). High rates of sensitivity were also found to ampicillin in S. typhi (96%) and other salmonella serotypes (85%), whilst only 57% of Shigella species and 14% of Escherichia coli were sensitive to this antibiotic. Low rates of sensitivity to sulphamethoxazole, streptomycin and tetracycline were found in shigella and E. coli (ranging from 7 to 14%). Approximately 50% of S. typhi and other salmonella serotypes were sensitive to sulphamethoxazole and streptomycin and 80% to tetracycline. Resistance to three or more antibiotics was very common in shigella and enteropathogenic strains of E. coli (74-85%), less common in non-typhoid salmonella (29%) and exceptional in S. typhi strains. In general, shigella and E. coli isolates showed a high rate of resistance to several antibiotics, whilst S. typhi and other salmonella serotypes retained their original sensitivity to most of the antibiotics used in clinical practice.
