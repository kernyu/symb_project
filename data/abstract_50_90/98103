The antimicrobial effect of cationic and anionic surface-active substances, i.e. catamine AB and sulphonol NP-3 respectively was studied in vitro with respect to gramnegative bacteria. In non-bactericidal concentrations catamine AB significantly increased the efficacy of tetracyclines, while the anionic compound had no such effect. The increase in the tetracycline activity was due to the antibiotic increased absorption (14C-oxytetracycline as an example) on the treatment of gramnegative bacteria with catamine AB and staphylococci with catamine AB and sulphonol NP-3, which was mainly associated with impairement of the cell membrane permeability by the surface-active substances.
