Systemic fungal infections are life-threatening diseases that are occurring with increasing frequency, especially in immunocompromised patients. Advances in the treatment of systemic fungal infections have been achieved through better understanding of two classic antifungal drugs, amphotericin B and flucytosine, and through the recent development of several antifungal azole derivatives. The purpose of this paper is to review the recent advances in pharmacology, toxicology, formulation and clinical trials of antifungal agents for the treatment of systemic mycoses.
