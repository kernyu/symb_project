Twenty clinical isolates of beta-lactamase-producing Neisseria gonorrhoeae from Japanese sources were studied to define their ability to serve as donors for their plasmids in conjugation with Neisseria meningitidis. These twenty strains of N. gonorrhoeae harbored the 4.5-megadalton (Mdal) beta-lactamase-producing plasmids and the 24.5-Mdal conjugative plasmids. We found that only three of twenty N. gonorrhoeae strains showed a detectable conjugation frequency (greater than 10(-5)) with N. meningitidis as the recipient although all strains were capable of mobilizing beta-lactamase-producing plasmids to N. gonorrhoeae and to Escherichia coli. The 4.5-Mdal beta-lactamase-producing plasmid was maintained in N. meningitidis, but the large 24.5-Mdal conjugative plasmid has not been found in N. meningitidis transconjugants.
