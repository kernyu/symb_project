The synergistic activity of the combination cefotaxime-desacetylcefotaxime (CTX/dCTX) was compared to the effectiveness of seven other antimicrobial agents: cefoxitin (CFOX), cefotetan (CTAN), ceftizoxime (CTIZ), chloramphenicol (CLOR), clindamycin (CLIND), metronidazole (METR), and ampicillin-sulbactam (A/S) tested against 100 clinical isolates belonging to the Bacteroides fragilis group. All tests were performed using the NCCLS reference agar-dilution method. The overall susceptibility of these organisms to CTX/dCTX was 84% compared to CFOX at 78% or CTAN at 66%. The other antimicrobials inhibited greater than 90% of these isolates. There was no difference between the susceptibility rates of CTX/dCTX and CTX with the B fragilis (85%) or B. distasonis (75%) strains. Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron showed a 11% greater susceptibility to CTX/dCTX than to CTX. Of the 100 isolates tested, 40% showed either synergy or partial synergistic interactions between CTX and dCTX. Most of the isolates showed indifference (52%), while 8% demonstrated antagonism; a relatively unique finding to date.
