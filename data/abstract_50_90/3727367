Studied was the sensitivity to therapeutic means of a total of 315 Salmonella strains isolated from birds--broilers, laying hens, pheasants and others-that died from salmonella infection. The strains were typed as follows: S. gallinarum-215, S. pullorum -19, S. enteritidis-30, S. typhimurium-19, S. thompson-5, S. oranienburg-14, and other salmonellae-13. All strains were sensitive to furazolidon, nalidixic acid, flumekin, colistin, apramycin, amicacin, and sizomycin. A high percent of sensitive salmonellae were found: to gentamycin-99.68%, carbenicillin-99.93%, chloramphenicol-97.78%, kanamycin-98.41%, ampicillin-92.38%, tetracycline-92.60%, and streptomycin-90.97%. To the antibiotics used for prophylactic and control purposes with regard to salmonella infections of birds in this country the sensitivity of the strains ranged as follows: to gentamycin-1 (1.59%), to carbenicillin-2 (0.63%), to kanamycin-5 (1.59%), chloramphenicol-7 (2.22%), to tetracycline-23 (7.30%), and to ampicillin-24 (7.62%). All strains were isolated from flocks that had been continuously treated with antibiotics. Differences were found in the resistance of the various species of Salmonella also during the years with no definite trend toward a rise of the resistant strains.
