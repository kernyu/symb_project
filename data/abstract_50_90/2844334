Intravenous foscarnet was given on an emergency basis to 30 immunosuppressed patients with cytomegalovirus (CMV) disease, of whom 28 were organ transplant recipients. Thirteen patients responded to foscarnet by cessation of CMV secretion. The in vitro sensitivity to foscarnet of the CMV isolates from non-responders before, during and after foscarnet treatment was similar to that of viral isolates from responders before or during foscarnet treatment and also to CMV isolates from non-treated patients, with mean in vitro IC50 values of 239-294 microM of foscarnet. Thus, there was no evidence of increased resistance of the CMV isolates obtained after foscarnet treatment. A higher total foscarnet dose appeared to favor response.
