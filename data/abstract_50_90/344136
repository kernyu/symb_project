In vitro recombination via restriction endonucleases and the in vivo genetic translocation of the Ap resistance (Apr) gene resulted in the construction of a new cloning vehicle, the plasmid pBR313. This vector was derived from a ColE1-like plasmid and, while it does not produce colicon E1, it still retains colicin E1 immunity. The Apr and tetracycline resistance (Tcr) markers carried in pBR313 were derived from the ampicillin transposon (TnA) of pRSF2124 and pSC101 respectively. During the construction of pBR313, the TnA component was altered and the Apr gene in pBR313 can no longer be translocated. This plasmid has a molecular weight of 5.8 Mdalton and has been characterized using thirteen restriction enzymes, six of which (EcoRI, SmaI, HpaI, HindIII, BamHI and SalI) cleave the plasmid at unique restriction sites. This allows the molecular cloning of DNA fragments generated by these six enzymes. The restriction sites for the latter three enzymes, HindIII, BamHI and SalI, are located in the Tcr gene(s). Cloning DNA fragments into these sites alters the expression of the Tcr mechanisms thus providing a selection for cells carrying recombinant plasmid molecules. An enrichment method for AprTcS cells carrying recombinant plasmid molecules is described.
