Isolation of emetine-resistant mutants of Entamoeba histolytica is described. Spontaneous rate of mutation, obtained from a Luria-Delbruck fluctuation test was 2.5 X 10(-7). The mutagenesis frequency obtained from the number of colonies grown in the presence of emetine, divided by the number of viable trophozoites inoculated in semisolid agar was less than or equal to 10(-7) and it was increased from 10 to 100 fold with ethyl methanesulfonate. Two types of clones were isolated: one was cross-resistant to colchicine and the other was not, indicating that mutation took place at different loci. Protein synthesis in the presence of emetine remained unaltered for colchicine-sensitive mutants, suggesting that the molecular lesion lay in the protein synthesis machinery. Colchicine-resistant mutants showed a lower level of [35S]methionine incorporation, probably due to alterations in the molecular transport of some substances across the membrane. This mutant clone was also deficient in red blood cell adhesion, suggesting membrane alterations.
