The effects of several plasmids, including cloning vectors and R factors, on the virulence of Vibrio cholerae CA401R were determined by measuring the dose-related diarrheal response in orally challenged infant mice. The plasmids were also examined for their effects on the colonization ability of strain CA401R by joint infection experiments with a spectinomycin-resistant CA401 strain as an internal standard. One V. cholerae R factor, pVH2, enhanced the diarrheal response, while R factors Rts1 and pVH1 reduced it; plasmids RP4, pRK290, Sa, pSJ8, pSJ5, and pBR328 had no effect. The ability of the plasmids to affect in vitro toxin production by CA401R was variable. Cells containing large plasmids all showed a modest decrease in colonization ability. These results showed that some plasmids affected V. cholerae virulence, but that the cloning vectors pBR328, RP4, and pRK290 did not.
