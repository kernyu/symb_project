The use of the quantitative nasal culture was investigated as a means of evaluation of new antimicrobial drugs in man. Cyclacillin was somewhat more active in vitro than penicillin G against penicillin G-resistant organisms. Cyclacillin was highly effective in suppressing staphylococci susceptible to penicillin G in nasal carriers but did not suppress staphylococci resistant to penicillin G. Although in previous studies by others cyclacillin was effective in treating mice infected with penicillin G-resistant staphylococci, in the present studies cyclacillin was not effective in suppressing nasal penicillin G-resistant staphylococci in man at doses which markedly suppressed penicillin G-sensitive organisms.
