The antibacterial activity of three udder creams and two ointments was assayed using three different methods. Seven different bacterial genera were used as test organisms providing a total of 17 strains. Only a single strain of corynebacterium was inhibited by all the preparations. Certain strains of staphylococci and streptococci were inhibited by four of the preparations. The gram-negative organisms showed greatest resistance to the antibacterial agents tested. The in vitro assays showed only one of the five preparations to have even slight bactericidal activity. These preparations when tested on the teats of dry and lactating cows showed similar results to the in vitro experiments.
