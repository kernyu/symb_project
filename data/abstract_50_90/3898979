Most physicians believe that the diabetic patient is predisposed to infections and that infections complicate the control of the diabetes. Despite the lack of scientific proof, certain infections (such as tuberculosis, bacteriuria in females, malignant external otitis, rhinocerebral mucormycosis, emphysematous cholecystitis, emphysematous pyelonephritis, acute papillary necrosis etc) are widely regarded to be associated with the diabetic. Foot infections, infections of the respiratory tract and the urinary tract are very important in the diabetic. The reasons why diabetics are susceptible to infections are unclear: although the production of humoral antibody appear intact, defective function of the polymorphonuclear leucocytes has been demonstrated. Successful treatment of infections in the diabetic requires early and exact diagnosis, the exhibition of the correct antimicrobials, the treatment of the diabetic state and associated disorders and prompt surgical intervention where required. Good control of blood glucose in diabetic patients is a desirable goal in the prevention of certain infections and to ensure maintenance of normal host defense mechanisms that determine resistance and response to infection.
