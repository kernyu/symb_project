Transcription initiation from beta-lactamase, tetracycline resistance and RNA 1 promoters, present in plasmid pAT153, were studied employing the abortive initiation technique. Assays appear to be promoter-specific with supercoiled and linear templates. Supercoiling enhances the isomerization rate constant of the open RNA-polymerase--promoter complex formation. Results agree with the in vivo behaviour of the corresponding promoters, and allow us to propose a hypothesis about the effect of supercoiling on transcription initiation.
