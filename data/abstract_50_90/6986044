Travelers to areas where malaria is endemic must be apprised of the risks they will face and the methods they should employ to prevent infection. Patients should be screened for glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, and a chemoprophylactic drug should be prescribed. Chloroquine should be given to tourists traveling to areas where chloroquine resistance has not been reported. For travelers to chloroquine-resistant areas, sulfadoxine with pyrimethaime or some other synergistic drug combination should be prescribed.
