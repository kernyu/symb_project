Transformation of the ability to synthesize type polysaccharide antigen and beta-hemolysin has been obtained in group F streptococci. Colonies possessing cells transformed to antigen synthesis were detected on the agar surface with fluorescein-labeled anti-type serum. This selection method, in contrast to those with antibiotics, allowed both transformed and nontransformed cells to grow, resulting in sectored colonies. These colonies could be subcultured to further establish the synthesis of antigen. Group F, group A, and group-like z deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) labeled with type II antigen and hemolysin, and streptomycin resistance transferred each marker to a group F strain lacking a type antigen. DNA from group F and z3 strains labeled with type III antigen, and streptomycin resistance transferred both markers to group F and z3 strains lacking type antigen. A second F strain without type antigen was not transformed with any of these markers. A group H strain was transformed to streptomycin resistance only by the same types of DNA. Transformation to type II antigen synthesis always resulted in the formation of beta-hemolysin. All strains isolated from natural sources contained both markers. A mutant, obtained by nitrosoguanidine treatment of an FII(sr) strain, did not synthesize either the hemolysin or the antigen. This mutant still possessed the group antigen and streptomycin resistance. A close linkage of type II antigen and beta-hemolysin is indicated. The fluorescent-antibody staining of cells containing both group and type antigens showed a more intense ultraviolet adsorption for type than group antigen. A surface location (microcapsular) for the type antigen appeared likely. These results are of interest for studies on antigen biosynthesis, genetics, and classification of the streptococci.
