One hundred sixteen infants in an intensive care nursery acquired Staphylococcus aureus resistant to gentamicin and methicillin; 54 patients acquired S. aureus sensitive to gentamicin and methicillin. Topical application of gentamicin ointment was significantly associated with acquisition of GMRS. Of 78 infants who acquired GMRS, 38 had received GmO before GMRS was first cultured, whereas only one of 49 infants with GMSS had previously received GmO (P = 8.6 X 10(-8)). Infants with GMRS were also more likely than patients with GMSS to have had a lower mean birth weight, Apgar score, and gestational age; systemic antibiotic therapy and incubator care were significantly prolonged for patients with GMRS, but these factors did not explain susceptibility to GMRS infection. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that use of GmO was the single most important risk factor.
