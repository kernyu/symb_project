Selective 6'-N-alkylation of 1,2'-di-N-benzyloxycarbonylfortimicin B was effected by both catalytic and chemical reductive alkylation in the presence of aldehydes. These facile selective 6'-N-alkylations were used as the basis of the preparations of the 6',6'-di-N-methylfortimicins A and B, and the 6'-N-methylfortimicins A and B. Of these new 6'-N-methylated fortimicins, only 6'-N-methylfortimicin A has appreciable antibacterial activity, which was about half that of fortimicin A.
