In an open clinical trial, spectinomycin and penicillin G were compared with regard to clinical efficacy, side effects, as well as bacteriological sensitivity in patients suffering from acute gonorrhea. The study was concerned with 176 female patients of a harbor medical practice who were frequently changing partners. 87 out of these patients were treated with spectinomycin, 89 of them with penicillin G. Smear specimens of all patients were tested microscopically; in addition, we performed bacteriological tests (as agar diffusion test, tube dilution test, beta-lactamase test). Both spectinomycin and penicillin showed a good clinical efficacy, except for one case of resistance against penicillin. Afterwards, this patient was successfully treated with spectinomycin. Apart from intermittent pain in the injection area, no side effects have been reported in either group of patients.
