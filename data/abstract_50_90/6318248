Several plasmid vectors for cloning in Staphylococcus aureus and S. carnosus have been constructed and characterized. The chimeric plasmids are composed of parts of the following parental plasmids: The chloramphenicol-resistance plasmid, pC194, the tetracycline-resistance plasmid, pMK148, and the erythromycin-resistance plasmid, pE12. All the chimeric plasmids confer two selectable antibiotic-resistance markers on host cells. Insertional inactivation of the various antibiotic-resistance markers occurred at the BclI site of pE12, and the Sau96- or AvaII-site of pMK148; only a slight inactivation of the chloramphenicol-resistance marker occurred at the HaeIII-site of pC194. The chimeric plasmids pCT20 and pCE10 are both stable in S. aureus and S. carnosus. In addition, the hybrid plasmids of pCT20 and pCE10, containing lambda-DNA fragments in various restriction sites between 0.4 and 1.2 kb, are stably maintained. The inserted lambda-DNA fragments appear unchanged.
