Sensitivity to 10 antibiotics of 1074 strains of opportunistic enterobacteria isolated from 117 children at the age of 2 years was studied (57 healthy children and 60 children with salmonellosis). The structure of the conjugative drug resistance of the opportunistic enterobacteria, the frequency of their isolation and the spectrum correlating with multiple resistance of the strains to 4-10 antibiotics were shown. The frequency of the conjugative determinants of the antibiotics resistance in the opportunistic bacteria isolated from the patients with salmonellosis was higher. The structure of the conjugative drug resistance of the opportunistic enterobacteria in the dynamics of the salmonellosis process was close to the transmissive R-plasmid resistance of S. typhimurium.
