In the late logarithmic or very early stationary phase of the growth cycle, yeast cells of Candida albicans undergo a shift from susceptibility to resistance to the direct lethal action of miconazole. Regulation of this phenotypic shift was examined. Experiments based on viable count determinations and the construction of time-kill curves showed that reestablishment of resistance is independent of both pH and the attainment of some critical viable cell density. However, it was found that development of resistance requires the continued availability of an appropriate energy source toward the end of exponential growth.
