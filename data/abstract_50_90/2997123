Streptococcus faecalis R plasmid pJH1 did not transform competent strains of Streptococcus sanguis. A hybrid plasmid, pDL310, consisting of virtually all of the S. faecalis hemolysin-bacteriocin plasmid pJH2 and a segment of pJH1 DNA that included the tetracycline resistance determinant, yielded tetracycline-resistant transformants at a frequency of less than 10(-8) transformants per CFU, when it was added to a competent culture of S. sanguis Wicky. Four of the transformants contained a 4.7-kilobase plasmid (pDL316) that transformed strain Wicky at a frequency of 8.6 X 10(-8). Restriction endonuclease digests, agarose gel electrophoresis, and Southern blot hybridizations indicated that pDL316 consisted entirely of pJH1-derived DNA. Additional restriction studies, Southern blot hybridizations, and heteroduplex analyses indicated that pDL316 was very closely related to 4.6-kilobase tetracycline resistance plasmid pAM alpha 1 delta 1, a derivative of 9.0-kilobase S. faecalis plasmid pAM alpha 1.
