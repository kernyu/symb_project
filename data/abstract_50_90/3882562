The effect of N-acyl derivatives of muramyl dipeptide (N-acetyl muramyl-L-alanyl-D-isoglutamine) on the activation of peritoneal adherent cells (PAC) in vivo and on the stimulation of nonspecific host resistance against Escherichia coli infection was examined in comparison with the effect of 6-O-stearoyl muramyl dipeptide. N-acyl muramyl dipeptide derivatives increased the release of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) by PAC from mice treated 1 day before upon stimulation with phorbol myristate acetate, and their activities did not depend on the chain length or kinds of fatty acids introduced. The results obtained using N-stearoyl muramyl dipeptide analogs indicated that the acyl moiety combined to muramic acid played a more important role in the ability of PAC to release H2O2 than did the peptide moiety. PAC from mice treated with N-stearoyl muramyl dipeptide, N-(3-hydroxy-2-docosylhexacosanoyl) muramyl dipeptide, and 6-O-stearoyl muramyl dipeptide 1 day before, including 20 to 42% polymorphonuclear leukocytes, released large amount of H2O2, and most of the H2O2 released was due to the attribution of polymorphonuclear leukocytes. The cytostatic activity of PAC from mice treated with these three compounds reached a maximum on day 3 after injection, and the cytolytic activity of PAC was induced by N-stearoyl muramyl dipeptide on day 3 and by 6-O-stearoyl muramyl dipeptide on day 1 after injection. In contrast to the above results, N-acyl muramyl dipeptide derivatives did not stimulate nonspecific host resistance against E. coli infection in mice when compared to 6-O-stearoyl muramyl dipeptide.
