The antimicrobial susceptibility of clinical isolates of the Bacteroides fragilis group was determined at six community hospitals (one large, greater than 600 beds; and five smaller, 96-325 beds). Imipenem was the most active beta-lactam with 100% of isolates being sensitive at 4 micrograms/ml. The percentage of isolates inhibited at 16 micrograms/ml (and 32 micrograms/ml) for the 7-alpha-methoxy antibiotics was: cefoxitin 66 (90); moxalactam 73 (85); cefotetan 68 (72); cefmetazole 40 (61). Metronidazole, chloramphenicol, and clindamycin were active against 100%, 100%, and 89% at breakpoints of 8 micrograms/ml, 8 micrograms/ml, and 4 micrograms/ml, respectively. The activity of several beta-lactams in our report differed slightly from that reported from university teaching hospitals. There were differences at many of the breakpoints for activity of some of the beta-lactam antibiotics for isolates from the large community hospital as compared with the combined isolates from the smaller community hospitals. Interestingly, the pattern was one of more resistance at the smaller community hospitals.
