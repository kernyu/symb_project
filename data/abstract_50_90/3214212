A mathematical model of antibiotic and immunostimulator (IMS) combined effect on various elements of the immune system and general state of patients with infectious diseases is described. The model was constructed as a system including 6 usual differential equations of the 1st order. With the use of this model and a computer many diverse variants of infection development under conditions of treatment with IMS at the background of antibiotic therapy were modeled. Ii was shown that IMS-antibiotic complexes markedly improved the indices of antibiotic therapy as compared to the use of the antibiotics alone. In combined use of IMS and antibiotics it was possible to lower the antibiotic doses without lowering the antimicrobial effect. The use of IMS at the optimal period led to balanced activation of the host specific and nonspecific resistance factors at the background of antibacterial therapy. The results of the mathematical modeling corresponded to the data on protective effect of salmozan (IMS) and doxycycline (antibiotic) combination in animals (albino mice). It was concluded that the described mathematical model was adequate for validation and optimization of schemes for combined use of IMS and antibacterial agents.
