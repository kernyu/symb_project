The virulence and antibiotic resistance of the same 75 strains of pathogenic Escherichia (PE) has been studied. Simultaneous determination of virulence in three tests (keratoconjuctival, intranasal and with the infection of cell culture) has permitted increasing detection of virulence strains to 97.4%. Differences of PE in O-antigen as well as differences of strains depending on the source of their isolation (a sick or a healthy carrier) have not an essential effect on the PE virulence. Drug resistance of PE was induced by neomycin (the highest degree) and by other antibiotics (arranged in the descending order): mycin, streptomycin, laevomycetin, polymyxin, tetracyclin and gentamycin.
