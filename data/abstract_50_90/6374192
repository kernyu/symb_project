Ceftazidime ( CAZ ) exhibited in vitro activity greater than cefoperazone, cefotiam, cefmetazole and cefazolin and almost equal to cefotaxime (CTX), ceftizoxime (CZX) and latamoxef ( LMOX ) against E. coli and K. pneumoniae isolated from obstetrical or gynecological infections excluding urinary tract infections. This drug demonstrated less activity than other 6 cephems against B. fragilis. Against anaerobic Gram-positive cocci, it showed less activity than other cephems. CAZ was administered to 11 patients with obstetrical and gynecological infections. The clinical results of this drug were as follows; excellent in each 1 case of parametritis , wound infection and BARTHOLIN's abscess, good in 7 cases including 1 of puerperal fever, 2 of intrauterine infection and 4 of adnexitis, and poor in 1 cases of adnexitis. No side effects or haematobiochemical abnormalities were observed throughout this trial.
