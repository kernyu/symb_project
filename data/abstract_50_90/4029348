Groups of chickens were medicated with the anticoccidial drug, decoquinate, and starting 1 day after this medication they were given daily inoculations of either 1 X 10(4) (Experiment 1) or 1 X 10(5) (Experiment 2) oocysts of a decoquinate-sensitive strain of Eimeria tenella. This assured the presence of large numbers of drug-inhibited sporozoites in the cecal tissues. The immunity arising from the presence of these inhibited sporozoites was assessed by challenging the medicated chickens with a 2.5 X 10(5) oocysts of a decoquinate-resistant strain of E. tenella. The response to challenge was assessed by weight gain, the severity of cecal lesions, hematocrits, and cecal oocyst numbers. The inhibited sporozoites promoted little (if any) immunity judged by clinical signs of disease. However, judged by body weight changes after challenge, the presence of inhibited sporozoites provided substantial protection against the body-weight-depressing effects of the challenge dose. These findings emphasize the importance of stage-specific antigen expression in Eimeria spp. infections and support the notion that immunogenicity is associated with tropic stages of the parasite.
