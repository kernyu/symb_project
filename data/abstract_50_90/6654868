Chloroquine-resistant (CQr) clones (CQ-21 and CQ-22) have been isolated from mutagenized hamster lung V79 cells by exposing the cells to a high dose of chloroquine. CQ-21 and CQ-22 showed about 3-fold higher resistance to chloroquine than the parental V79 cells, and they showed specific cross-resistance to another amine, NH4Cl, which is also concentrated in lysosomes. CQr clone showed no cross-resistance to other unrelated agents. Chloroquine-induced inhibition of [125I]ricin internalization was observed in both cell lines at neutral pH, but the inhibition of uptake was less in the variant. Also, the degradation of endogenous protein was slowed in the mutant; further, treatment of cells with 30 micrograms/ml of chloroquine inhibited the degradation of endogenous proteins in the parental V79, but not in CQ-22 cells. Similar levels of acid phosphatase, beta-glucuronidase and cathepsin D were observed in V79 and CQ-22 cells, but the level of cathepsin B was lower in the mutant. Electron microscopy showed an increased number of electron-dense bodies, possibly autophagosomes/lysosomes, in the mutant cells grown for 4 days with 5 micrograms/ml of chloroquine. Similar aberrant structures were observed in the parental V79 cells treated for only 3 h with 5 micrograms/ml of chloroquine.
