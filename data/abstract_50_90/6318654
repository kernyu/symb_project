A plasmid conferring resistance to the aminocyclitol antibiotic hygromycin B was isolated from Escherichia coli. The gene conferring resistance to this drug was cloned in pBR322, and the gene was localized to a fragment of ca. 1,510 base pairs. Resistance to hygromycin B is determined by an aminocyclitol phosphotransferase that modifies hygromycin B and structurally related antibiotics. The specific modification of hygromycin B is a phosphorylation of the hydroxyl on the 4 position of the cyclitol ring (hyosamine). The presence of the phosphotransferase in E. coli correlates with reduced accumulation of [14C]hygromycin B.
