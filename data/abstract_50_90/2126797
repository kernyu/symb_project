The auxotypes of 592 strains of Neisseria gonorrhoeae isolated in Sapporo between 1980 and 1989 were investigated. The serotypes of some of these strains were also studied, and the relation between the auxotype and the sensitivity to Amoxicillin (AMPC) was analyzed. The results were as follows. 1. The auxotypes of Neisseria gonorrhoeae isolated in Sapporo were similar to those distributed in Southeast Asia. 2. In a study of the auxotypes by year, the frequency of proto and Pro- decreased, while the frequency of AHU- increased. 3. The serotypes of all strains of Neisseria gonorrhoeae investigated were WII/WIII, there was no WI serotype. 4. With respect to the relation between auxotypes and sensitivity to AMPC, the AHU- strains were more sensitive than proto or Pro-.
