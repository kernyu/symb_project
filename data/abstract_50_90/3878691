The outcome of treatment of 48 episodes of septicemia due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in 44 patients was assessed. Twenty-six of the patients died; nineteen of them died of infection, and infection was a major contributing factor to the deaths of the remaining seven patients. Fourteen of fifteen patients treated with inadequate antibiotic therapy died, and the other patient developed a mycotic aneurysm of the femoral artery, for which amputation was necessary. Eight of eleven patients treated with amikacin (alone or combined with another antimicrobial) died, and three recovered slowly; only one recovered fully without sequelae. In an additional two patients who failed to respond to amikacin, treatment was changed to vancomycin. Vancomycin was used to treat 18 episodes of MRSA septicemia in 17 patients. In 14 of these episodes the patients recovered fully. One patient died of uncontrolled infection, and in three, infection was a contributing factor but not the major cause of death. Vancomycin was confirmed as antibiotic of choice in treating MRSA septicemia.
