A brief review of the special aspects concerning the use and selection of chemotherapeutic agents and antibiotics in bacterial infections occurring in gynaecology both specifically and generally. In case of severe bacterial infections such as sepsis it is recommended to combine two antibodies (e.g. beta-lactam antibiotics with aminoglycosides or several beta-lactam antibiotics together). Special attention is given to the particularly effective broad-spectrum penicillins and cephalosporins as well as to the aminoglycoside antibiotics etc. Individual well-tried antibiotics are briefly characterised in respect of their anti-bacterial efficacy (sensitivity and resistance), their field of application, and their dosage. In particular, the possibilities of the therapy of infections by anaerobic microorganisms and fungi are pointed out. In addition, a brief description is given of antibacterial chemotherapy of pneumonias of urinary tract infections and specifically gynaecological infections (such as adnexitis, endometritis, parametritis, pelveoperitonitis) under the aspects of rational antibiotic treatment. The article includes by pointing out the possibilities of prophylactic administration of antibiotics especially in surgical procedures in the sense of a perioperative short-term prophylaxis.
