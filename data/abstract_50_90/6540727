We have tried to study genetics of Chinese hamster cellular drug resistance to colchicine, actinomycin D and ethidium bromide. Resistant variants arising at a frequency 10(-5) to 10(-7) were selected from a sensitive population. Pretreatment with MNNG increased this frequency 106, 9-15, 12-26 times for colchicine, actinomycin D and ethidium bromide, respectively. Fluctuation test analysis allows to suppose that phenotypic expression of drug resistance is genetically determined and resulted from random genetical events. Significant values of particular correlation coefficients for selecting resistant variants in a set of independently originated subpopulations suggest the genetical identity of the majority of variants selected by colchicine and actinomycin D. At the same time, the significant portion of colchicine-resistant cells may be selected using ethidium bromide. It is not unlikely that under above experimental conditions, each selective agent reveals genetically different resistant variants. The possible genetic mechanisms of resistance to the drugs used are discussed.
