Several aminoglycoside dosage regimens were studied in a kinetic in vitro model. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus aureus were exposed in serially placed artificial capillary units to netilmicin concentrations that changed based on human two-compartment pharmacokinetics. The same total dose per 24 h was administered as a continuous infusion (3.7 micrograms/ml) or in 1-h infusions given every 24 (24 micrograms/ml) or 8 h (8 micrograms/ml). The once daily administration showed the best response in terms of either faster killing of E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and S. aureus or greater reduction of the inocula of P. aeruginosa. After 28 h of treatment, however, all regimens reduced the nonpseudomonads by more than 99.99%, whereas all three P. aeruginosa strains regrew to greater than 10(8) CFU/ml due to selection of resistant subpopulations. In contrast to the bactericidal effect of the first dose, no killing occurred after subsequent doses if the ratio of peak drug concentration to MIC was low (less than or equal to 6). These results support the concept of administering high doses of aminoglycosides once every 24 h.
