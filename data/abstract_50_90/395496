The in vitro activity of cefamandole was compared with that of cephalotin, cefoxitin, and cefuroxime against 612 bacterial strains isolated in hospital. Cephalotin was more active than cefamandole and the other two cephalosporins against oxacillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus strains. In contrast, the activity of cefamandole was superior to that of the other cephalosporins against oxacillin-resistant strains of S. aureus. This improved activity was confirmed by study in media with a high salt content and by population analysis. The activity of cefamandole against cephalotin-sensitive enterobacteria was superior to that of the other cephalosporins. Its activity was comparable to that of cefoxitin and cefuroxime against cephalotin-resistant strains. However, there were marked variations in this activity in relation to the different species. The therapeutic use of these new cephalosporins, and of cefamandole in particular, should thus be selective and based on the results of bacteriologic studies.
