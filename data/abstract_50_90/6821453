The activity of temocillin was investigated in vitro against 523 clinical isolates of enterobacteria and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The minimum inhibitory concentration of the new compound for all ampicillin-susceptible enterobacteria and for 90% of ampicillin-resistant enterobacteria was 16 micrograms/ml or less, a concentration readily achieved in plasma. P. aeruginosa strains were uniformly resistant to temocillin. All but 3 of a separate group of 48 enterobacteria exhibiting resistance to the combination of clavulanic acid and amoxicillin were found to be inhibited by 16 micrograms or less of temocillin per ml. The new compound also displayed good activity against a group of laboratory stock cultures selected on the basis of differential resistance to presently available beta-lactam agents. Two of these strains were cefotaxime resistant.
