MICs of BRL 25000, a combination of a newly developed beta-lactamase inhibitor CVA and AMPC in the ratio of 1 to 2, were determined against a number of bacterial strains and compared with those of AMPC, CVA, CEX and CCL. The 98 bacterial strains tested included 2-S. aureus, 23-H. influenzae, 25-E. coli, 22-K. pneumoniae and 26-P. mirabilis. In pharmacokinetic studies, BRL 25000 medium granules were administered to groups of 3 male subjects, aged between 7 years 8 months and 9 years 5 months, at doses of 10, 15 and 20 mg/kg, 2 hours after a meal. The resultant serum and urine concentrations and drug recoveries were measured. Furthermore, BRL 25000 was administered to a total 43 patients (2-pharyngitis, 8-tonsillitis, 3-bronchitis, 2-pneumonia and 28-urinary tract infection) whom clinically evaluable. An average daily dosage of 45.3 mg/kg was given, in 3 or 4 divided doses, for a period of 8 days on average. Clinical and bacteriological effects as well as side effects were studied. In the microbiological studies on 98 clinical strains, including beta-lactamase negative bacteria, BRL 25000 showed MICs against the Gram-positive cocci (2-S. aureus) superior to the other 4 drugs at inoculum sizes of 10(8) and 10(6) cells/ml. For the Gram-negative bacilli, against H. influenzae at inoculum sizes of 10(8) and 10(6) cells/ml, BRL 25000 was inferior in the small MIC range but superior in the large MIC range to AMPC, and was superior to the other 3 drugs. Against E. coli at an inoculum of 10(8) cells/ml, BRL 25000 showed antibacterial activity next to AMPC and CCL whilst at an inoculum of 10(6) cells/ml, it was inferior in the small MIC range but superior in the large MIC range to AMPC and CEX and was inferior to CCL but superior to CVA. Against K. pneumoniae at an inoculum of 10(8) cells/ml, BRL 25000 was equal to AMPC, CVA and CEX but inferior to CCL, whilst at an inoculum of 10(6) cells/ml, it was inferior to CCL but superior to the other 3 drugs. Against P. mirabilis at inoculum sizes of 10(8) and 10(6) cells/ml, BRL 25000 was inferior in the small MIC range but equal or superior in the large MIC range to AMPC, and was superior to CVA and CEX.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
