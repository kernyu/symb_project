The development of strains of Eimeria maxima resistant to buquinolate, methyl benzoquate, clopidol, sulphaquinoxaline and robenidine is described. It was not possible to standardize a schedule of inoculations and drug administration, which would enable the development of resistance to the different drugs to be compared directly. Resistance developed most readily to the quinolones. One robenidine-resistant strain proved to be drug-dependent. Dinitolmide showed unusual effects upon sporogony and three attempts to develop resistance against this activity failed. Chicks previously immunized with the parent strain were completely protected against infection with the drug-resistant strains.
