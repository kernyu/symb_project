The growth of Naegleria fowleri cultures in a BCS medium was not affected either by trimethoprim at 400 micrograms/ml or by aminopterine, 3,5-diaminopterine and methotrexate at 500 micrograms/ml. N. lovaniensis propagation in the same medium was inhibited with 10 micrograms/ml of trimethoprim, 50 micrograms/ml methotrexate and 100 micrograms/ml 3,5-diaminopteridine. Aminopterine was ineffective at a concentration of 500 micrograms/ml. The inhibitory effect of trimethoprim on N. lovaniensis cultures depended on the medium composition and could be neutralized by an addition of folic or tetrahydrofolic acids and a suspension of heat-killed Enterobacter aerogenes. Thymine, thymidine, hypoxantine and 2-amino-4-hydroxy-6-(tetrahydroxybutyl)-pteridine did not have an adverse effect. Trimethoprim activity in N. fowleri cultures could not be enhanced by the addition of Triton X-100 and Polymyxine B. Cryolyzate of N. fowleri amoebae did not influence the trimethoprim inhibition of N. lovaniensis cultures. Deviation in dihydrofolatereductase chemical structure or thymine dependency seems to be the probable explanation for N. fowleri antifolate resistance.
