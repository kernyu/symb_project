Production of beta-lactamase by 15 strains of Haemophilus influenzae has been investigated. All the strains produce a constitutive beta-lactamase, which readily hydrolyses penicillin G, ampicillin, and cephaloridine. The beta-lactamase produced by these strains is indistinguishable from the type-IIIa enzyme commonly found in strains of Escherichia coli. The beta-lactamase gene has been transferred from the enzyme-producing strains of Haemophilus to strains of H. parainfluenzae and a strain of E. coli.
