Diethyl dithiolisophthalate exerts an antituberculous effect in mice comparable to that of isoniazid and streptomycin. It is effective when given in single doses, and against isoniazidresistant strains. It is most active when given subcutaneously either by injection or by absorption through the skin. Drug resistance has been demonstrated in mice, and isoniazid is active against such strains. The effects of this and other ethyl thiolesters are antagonized by their methyl analogues.
