In a double-blind study involving 430 patients, Locacorten (0.02%)-Vioform (3%) cream was found to be highly effective in the treatment of dermatological conditions complicated by secondary bacterial involvement. Themicrobiological conversion and clinical improvement in patients treated with Locacorten-Vioform combinations were markedly greater than those achieved in the groups medicated with (1) Vioform 3%, (2) Locacorten 0.02%, and (3) placebo cream. Staphylococcus aureus was the most prevalent organism isolated from the skin lesions. All strains were sensitive to Vioform, as compared to 62% found to be resistant to other antimicrobials.
