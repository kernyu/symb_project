The authors studied 130 strains of serologically typed E. coli for the capacity to provide reproduction of donor-specific phages MS2, Qbeta, and f1; positive increase of the donor-specific phages reaction was found in 12 cases. Some of the detected L-like plasmides bore determinants of colicinogenicity or drug resistance. Such plasmides were transmissive and capable of inhibiting donor properties controlled by factor F'-lac+, i.e. they served as plasmides of type fi+.
