The effect of chemical disinfection of the Heidbrink expiratory valve in buffered glutaraldehyde (Cidex solution) was investigated. Cidex caused stickiness and increased the opening pressure and resistance of the valve to different gas flow rates. An electrolytic type of corrosion may also have occurred. However, autoclaving of the Heidbrink valve did not appear to cause corrosion or significant alteration of its opening pressure or resistance.
