Erythromycin combines with 50S ribosomal subunit of an erythromycin-sensitive Escherichia coli (strain Q13), while ribosomes from an erythromycin-resistant mutant from this strain have little affinity for the antibiotic. A protein component of the 50S subunit of the mutant strain is distinct from that of the parent Q13 strain.
