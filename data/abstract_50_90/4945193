An R factor from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which confers resistance to penicillins, kanamycin, and tetracycline, was studied in Escherichia coli K-12. The R factor could coexist with F-like or I-like plasmids and therefore constituted a novel compatibility group. The R factor was transferable from E. coli to bacterial genera outside the Enterobacteriaceae (Pseudomonas and members of the Rhizobiaceae) to which transfer of F-like and I-like plasmids could not be demonstrated.
