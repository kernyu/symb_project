Bacteroides species are known to play an important role in orofacial infections. The present investigation shows that penicillin-resistant Bacteroides species are commonly found in the oral cavity and that their occurrence is related to previous penicillin therapy. Several of the penicillin-resistant isolates were also resistant to erythromycin and/or doxycycline while all strains were sensitive to clindamycin and tinidazole. the penicillin resistance was mainly due to beta-lactamase production. A selective cultivation method for detection of penicillin-resistant Bacteroides is described.
