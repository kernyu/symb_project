Acyclovir (Zovirax) is a qualified success as an effective and nontoxic antiviral chemotherapeutic agent and at present is approved for the treatment of initial genital herpes and limited life-threatening cutaneous herpes simplex viral infections in the immunocompromised host. Its efficacy in Epstein-Barr, varicella-zoster, and cytomegalorvirus infections appears less promising. According to one controlled study, its efficacy in the treatment of herpes labialis (HSV-1) infections has been disappointing. The highly selective action of acyclovir against viral DNA polymerase and its inhibition of viral DNA chain elongation result in a low incidence of human (host cell) toxicity, as manifested by local irritation at injection sites and a modest incidence of adverse renal effects, which can be reduced by judicious drug use. Newer antiviral agents now under development hold substantial promise for the future of antiviral chemotherapy.
