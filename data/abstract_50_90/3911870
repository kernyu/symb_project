The biological properties and sensitivity of 112 staphylococcal strains isolated from patients with pyoinflammatory diseases to antibiotics and 2 new derivatives of quinoline were studied. It was shown that the new derivatives of quinoline in concentrations of 3.9-7.8 micrograms/ml had a pronounced antimicrobial effect on S. aureus, C. diphtheriae and Candida. V. metchnicovi, Sh. flexneri, Salmonella and S. faecalis were sensitive to the compounds of the quinoline series in concentrations of 31.2-62.5 micrograms/ml. The antibiotic resistant staphylococcal strains were characterized by high sensitivity to the tested compounds and showed no cross resistance to them.
