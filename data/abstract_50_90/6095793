Altered baby hamster kidney (BHK-R) cells which were subcultured in the continuous presence of HVJ (hemagglutinating virus of Japan--the Sendai strain of parainfluenza 1 virus) showed a resistance to the antiviral action of both type I and II interferons. No evidence for a direct inactivation of interferon molecules during incubation of BHK-R cells was obtained. After serial subculture of BHK-R cells in growth medium free of HVJ, surface membranes with the proper sialic acid residues were restored and the cells became susceptible to the interferon action. It is suggested that binding sites for interferons might be ranked above HVJ receptors in the "receptor gradient".
