Nine mutants of Saccharomyces cerevisiae which are resistant to ketoconazole, have been isolated and characterized. In each case the mutation is nuclear in origin and allelic to a previously described mutation, erg3, which gives rise to a block in the delta 5-6 desaturation step of ergosterol biosynthesis. The significance of this second site mutation to the point of inhibitory action of ketoconazole, that is the P-450-mediated C-14 demethylation of lanosterol, is discussed.
