Escherichia coli isolates taken from environments considered to have low and high enteric disease potential for humans were screened against 12 antibiotics to determine the prevalence of multiple antibiotic resistance among the isolates of these environments. It was determined that multiple-antibiotic-resistant E. coli organisms exist in large numbers within the major reservoirs of enteric diseases for humans while existing in comparatively low numbers elsewhere. These differences provide a method for distinguishing high-risk contamination of foods by indexing the frequency with which multiple-antibiotic-resistant E. coli organisms occur among isolates taken from a sample.
