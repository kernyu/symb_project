Sensitivity of industrial strains and market preparations, such as bifidumbacterin and lactobacterin was studied with respect to 19 antibiotics. The MIC was determined with the method of serial dilutions. It was shown that bifidumbacteria and lactobacteria were either highly sensitive or markedly resistant to the antibiotics.
