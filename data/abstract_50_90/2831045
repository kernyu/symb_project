Three methods of typing herpes simplex virus were compared. A total of 111 clinical isolates obtained from patients not treated with antivirals and seven resistant mutants selected in vitro were tested by immunofluorescence assay using antibodies against herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2. Twenty-nine isolates were also studied by restriction endonuclease analysis. The sensitivity of isolates and resistant mutants to (E)-5-(2-bromovinyl)-2'-deoxyuridine was determined. Although a clear difference between the 50% inhibitory dose for type 1 and type 2 isolates was observed, some drug-resistant mutants might be misidentified by this method.
