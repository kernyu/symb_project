A DNA fragment containing the coding and regulatory sequences of the erythromycin (Er) resistance (ermE) gene of the Er produces Streptomyces erythraeus was cloned in Streptomyces lividans using the plasmid vector pIJ61. The approximate location and orientation of ermE were deduced from studies of its expression after subcloning in Escherichia coli. Sequences responsible for transcription of ermE in Streptomyces were studied by nucleotide (nt) sequencing, high resolution S1 and exonuclease VII mapping, in vitro transcription and in vivo promoter-probing. Tandemly arranged promoters of typical prokaryotic appearance initiate transcription of the coding region of ermE; a promoter of similar sequence was identified that initiates transcription of a likely coding region running in the opposite direction to ermE. It is suggested that these sites represent a class of vegetatively expressed Streptomyces promoter that is utilised by a form of RNA polymerase holoenzyme that also recognizes typical promoters of other bacterial genera.
