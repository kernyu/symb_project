The investigations about the radiolysis materials and their quantities, and, anti-microbial activities of gamma-irradiated (in the ranges of 0.516-2.064 kC/kg (2-8 MR] acrinol on liquid dosage form have been carried out to study the application of radiosterilization. About nine components were found as radiolysis materials. Most of them were also found in the UV-irradiated of Fenton's reagent-treated acrinol solution. Increase of anti-microbial activity was observed with gamma-irradiated acrinol solutions, but this phenomenon was not long-lasting. The micro-organism such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Staphylococcus aureus that infect at the lips of wound are highly sensitive to the gamma-irradiation. They are almost sterilized by the irradiation of 10 kGy (1.0 Mrad). At a low acrinol concentration, the decomposition rate of acrinol by the irradiation was relatively high. When 1.0% of acrinol solution was irradiated at a dose of 10 kGy (1.0 Mrad), the decomposition of the drug was less than 2% and the variation of anti-microbial activity was negligible.
