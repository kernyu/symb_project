The plasmid-borne gene hph coding for hygromycin B phosphotransferase (HPH) in Escherichia coli has been identified and its nucleotide sequence determined. The hph gene is 1026 nucleotides long, coding for a protein with a predicted Mr of 39 000. The hph gene was placed in a shuttle plasmid vector, downstream from the promoter region of the cyc 1 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and an hph construction containing a single AUG in the 5' noncoding region allowed direct selection following transformation in yeast and in E. coli. Thus the hph gene can be used in cloning vectors for both pro- and eukaryotes.
