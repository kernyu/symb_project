The chromosomal localization of fosfomycin resistance genes in three hospital Staphylococcus aureus strains and in the standard strain NCTC 8507 was shown. Moreover, the chromosomal locus of the gene determining resistance to three aminocyclitol antibiotics: gentamycin, kanamycin and tobramycin in the one of hospital strains was determined. The possibility of transducing this resistance and the absence of plasmid DNA in the obtained transductants, suggest transposomal nature of the gene determining gentamycin, kanamycin and tobramycin resistance in the investigated strain.
