The immunoactive peptides, FK-156 and its analogue, FK-565 were evaluated in various models of mice immunosuppressed with cyclophosphamide, hydrocortisone, mitomycin C, carrageenan and tumor cells. Treatment with FK-156 (subcutaneous) and FK-565 (oral) markedly restored host defense ability against microbial infection. The therapeutic effect of ticarcillin or gentamicin alone against pseudomonal infection in cyclophosphamide- and hydrocortisone-treated mice and tumor-bearing mice was much lower than in normal mice. The therapeutic effect of these antibiotics against pseudomonal infection in immunosuppressed mice was enhanced markedly by combined use with FK-156. The killing ability of macrophages and polymorphonuclear leukocytes of the immunosuppressed mice was also markedly enhanced by dosing with FK-156.
