Two controlled tests were conducted in 1981 and 1982 in dairy calves on the University of Kentucky research farm to determine activity of the bolus formulation of levamisole given at the dose rate of 8 mg/kg against naturally occurring infections of Ostertagia ostertagi. Removal efficacies of mature O ostertagi were 98% in the 1981 test (3 treated and 3 nontreated calves) and 94% in the 1982 test (7 treated and 8 nontreated calves). Against immature Ostertagia spp, removal efficacies were 100% and 65% for the 1st and 2nd tests, respectively. The calves were grazed on the same pasture as dairy calves in previous controlled tests in 1979 and 1980 where activity of levamisole against mature O ostertagi (data recently published) was much less than in the present tests. It does not appear that the poor performance in the early tests can be attributed to the drug resistance phenomenon. Data on overwinter survival (119 days) of free-living stages of gastrointestinal parasites on pasture were derived from the nontreated calves in the 1982 controlled test. The calves, raised helminth-free, were placed on the pasture on Apr 5, 1982. Helminths recovered at necropsy of the calves, besides O ostertagi, included Trichostrongylus axei, Nematodirus helvetianus, Nematodirus spp, Cooperia oncophora, Trichuris spp, and Moniezia spp. The lung-worm, Dictyocaulus viviparus, previously found in cattle on the farm, was not found in these calves.
