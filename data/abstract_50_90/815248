We describe the addition to the Pseudomonas aeruginosa sex factor, FP2, of carbenicillin resistance encoded by the RP1 plasmid. This occurred in a step-wise manner as detected by variations in the characteristics of the FP2-RP1 plasmid aggregate. The addition of the carbenicillin resistance marker to FP2 facilitates estimates of FP2 transfer. Transfer frequencies for the presumed cointegrate plasmid, using carbenicillin selection, approached 10(-1) per donor bacterium. The chromosomal mobilization properties of the derived plasmid, designated pR0271, resembled those of the progenitor plasmid FP2. Plasmid pR0271 was also observed to mobilize a nontransmissible drug resistance plasmid sharing genetic homology at frequencies corresponding to those observed for chromosomal markers proximal to the origin of transfer.
