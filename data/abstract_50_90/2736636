Using the contact test, the author investigated the antifungal efficiency of 13 disinfectants and antiseptic preparations (hydrogen peroxide, Persteril, Jodonal B, Jodisol, Chlordetal, Famosept-Super, Septonex, Ajatin, Cresolum saponatum, ethanol, Desident spray, chlorhexidine, Galli-Valerio solution) against 23 strains of eight genera of microscopic fungi (Absidia, Aspergillus, Candida, Geotrichum, Mucor, Rhizopus, Torulopsis and Trichosporon). The results revealed that filamentous fungi and among them in particular zygomycetes are more resistant against the above preparations than yeasts. The highest antifungal activity was observed in 5% Creolum saponatum and 1% and 2% Famosept Super. On the other hand, 3% H2O2, 5% Jodisol and 0.1% Chlorhexidine were almost ineffective. On investigations of the vitality of spores and fragments of the mycelium of the tested micromycetes the greatest resistance to desiccation was manifested by conidia and hyphae of aspergilli, the smallest one by blastopores of yeasts Candida albicans and Torulopsis glabrata.
