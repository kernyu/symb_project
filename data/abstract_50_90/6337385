Escherichia coli cells grown to logarithmic phase in, and plated on, rich medium (yeast extract-nutrient broth) were more resistant to X rays, ultraviolet (uv) radiation, and methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) than cells grown in, and plated on, minimal medium. We have called this enhanced survival capability medium-dependent resistance (MDR). The magnitude of MDR observed after oxic X irradiation was greater than that observed after anoxic X irradiation, uv irradiation, or MMS treatment. MDR was not observed in stationary-phase cells with X or uv radiation. MDR was associated with an increased ability to repair X-ray-induced DNA single-strand breaks, and with reduced X-ray-induced DNA degradation and protein synthesis retardation. Postirradiation protein synthesis was concluded to be critical in allowing the high X-ray survival associated with MDR, because of the large radiosensitization caused by a postirradiation growth medium shift down or treatment with rifampicin (RIF), recA protein must be at least one of the proteins whose synthesis is critical to MDR, as judged by the absence of MDR or a RIF effect in X-irradiated recA and lexA mutants. The results with X-irradiated temperature-conditional recA cells suggest that it is only after cells have been damaged that the recA gene plays a role in MDR.
