The Minimal Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) and the Nathan's Agar Well Diffusion (NAWD) tests are bacterial antimicrobial susceptibility predictors. Some suggest that the NAWD is not as reliable as the MIC test. We compared the MIC and NAWD tests as to how well they agree to bacterial sensitivity or resistance and predicted clinical outcome of burn wound infections. Using 65 bacterial isolates from burned patients, the MIC and NAWD tests agreed in 60.0% of the isolates (vs. a perfect agreement of 100%, p less than 0.001), implying that these tests are not interchangeable. From 18 burned patients treated with nitrofurazone or mafenide acetate, 28 infectious isolates were evaluated. The outcome of these infections was correctly predicted by NAWD in 92.8% and the MIC in 72.0% of the cases (p less than 0.05). It seems that for burns treated with topical antimicrobials, the NAWD is a more reliable predictor of bacterial susceptibility.
