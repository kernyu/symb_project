Portal blood flow was measured by means of direct bolus imaging (DBI), a method of measuring flow velocity with magnetic resonance imaging. DBI allows immediate visualization of fluid movement, thereby enabling calculation of a flow velocity from fluid displacement. In a study of 14 healthy male volunteers, portal blood flow was measured with electrocardiographic gating during the 18 seconds subjects could suspend respiration. These measurements showed a close correlation (r = .968) with those obtained by means of Doppler ultrasound (US). Increases in portal blood flow after oral administration of ethanol and glucose were measured with DBI. Glucose caused a statistically greater increase in portal blood flow volume in healthy control subjects than in patients with chronic hepatitis. Blood sugar, on the other hand, showed a significantly greater increase in these patients, possibly reflecting the greater vascular resistance of the liver. DBI is a useful noninvasive method of measuring portal blood flow without the limitations imposed on Doppler US by obesity and intestinal gas.
