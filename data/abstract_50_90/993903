The combined use of amphotericin B and 5-fluorocytosine in the treatment of two children with Candida albicans meningitis is described. Therapy consisted of nine to 13 days of iv amphotericin B, combined with, or followed by six to nine weeks of oral 5-FC. Each organism was sensitive to 5-FC before starting therapy. Resistance did not develop during therapy. CSF administration was not necessary and toxic reactions were minimal and transient; neither patient has suffered a recurrence four years and 14 months, respectively, after discontinuance of therapy. The combination of short-term therapy with iv amphotericin B plus long-term oral 5-FC was successful in these two patients.
