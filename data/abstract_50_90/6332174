Induction of beta-lactamase was monitored in a strain of Enterobacter cloacae exhibiting high resistance to most beta-lactam antibiotics. Large amounts of the enzyme were induced not only in the presence of beta-lactams, but also in the presence of other bicyclic molecules such as folic acid, thiamin, tryptophan or haemin. Moreover, complex media (such as Trypticase soy broth and Schaedler's broth) and various body fluids (serum, pleural fluid and cerebrospinal fluid) also possessed considerable induction potency. Neither 'specific' induction (by beta-lactams) nor 'non-specific' induction (by other bicyclic compounds) could be augmented by addition of exogenous cAMP. These findings indicate that inducible beta-lactamases deserve more attention, above all with respect to the development of resistance against third-generation cephalosporins.
