Sustained release cephalexin (S-6436) was studied in 23 outpatients (20 males, 3 females) who visited surgery of our hospital. The summary of the study is as follows: 1) The drug was administered for 2 approximately 8 days and the average was 3.5 days. Clinical effectiveness was 87.0% with the following breakdown: excellent 4, good 16, and poor 3. 2) Causative organisms isolated from the patients showing excellent effectiveness were all staphylococci. 3) No side effects were observed in any patients receiving the drug. From the above results, it is expected that S-6436 has good effectiveness and can be used as a first choice drug to outpatients with mild infections such as superficial infections who want to go to the office or school over their receiving the treatment.
