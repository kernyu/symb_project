The in vitro dextran-sucrase activities and adherence to glass of S. mutans 6715 and PS14 wild types and mutants were quantitated and compared with their in vivo cariogenicity in young, gnotobiotic rats. In general, S. mutans PS14 mutants B414 and B421 and 6715 mutant C4 demonstrated less dextran-sucrase activity and adherence than parental strains and caused fewer carious lesions in gnotobiotic rats. Rats monoinfected with either PS14 mutants B414 or B421 had less plaque and viable S. mutans in plaque than rats infected with parental strain. Both S. mutans 6715 mutants C211 and C229, demonstrated greater enzyme activity and adherence than the parental strain and produced more carious lesions.
