2,6-diaminpurine (DAP) selectively inhibited mitochondrial protein synthesis in yeast cells with concomitant failure of cells to grow in non-fermentable (yeast extract, glycerol) medium. The selectivity was pronounced in all strains tested (15) nearly all of which were able to grow in yeast extract, glucose medium containing 5 mg/ml DAP (maximum solubility) whereas growth was arrested in all strains at 250-500 microgram/ml DAP in the glycerol medium. The inhibition was reversed by further addition of adenine to the culture medium. RNA synthesis in rat liver mitochondria was depressed by DAP suggesting that the analogue affected RNA polymerase activity. There was no evidence of nuclear mutagenicity by DAP but resistance to the antibiotics chloramphenicol and oligomycin was induced by the drug. Genetic evidence, although limited, indicated that the resistance mutations were cytoplasmic. The mitochondrial petite mutation was also induced by DAP but only at comparatively high concentrations. The mutagenic effects were seen only in the glycerol medium.
