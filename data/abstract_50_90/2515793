The gene encoding a 6'-N-acetyltransferase, AAC(6')-II, was cloned from Pseudomonas aeruginosa plasmid pSCH884. This gene mediates resistance to gentamicin, tobramycin, and netilmicin but not amikacin or isepamicin. The DNA sequence of the gene and flanking regions was determined. The 5'- and 3'-flanking sequences showed near identity to sequences found abutting a variety of different genes encoding resistance determinants. It is likely that the current structure arose by the integration of the 572-base-pair sequence containing the AAC(6')-II gene into a Tn21-related sequence at the recombinational hot spot, AAAGTT. We have compared the sequence of the AAC(6')-II gene to genes of other 6'-N-acetyltransferases. An AAC(6')-Ib protein (encoded by the aacA4 gene; G. Tran Van Nhieu and E. Collatz, J. Bacteriol. 169:5708-5714, 1987) that results in resistance to amikacin but not gentamicin was found to share 82% sequence similarity with the AAC(6')-II protein. We speculate that these two genes arose from a common ancestor and that the processes of selection and dissemination have led to the observed differences in the spectrum of aminoglycoside resistance.
