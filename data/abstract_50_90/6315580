The mechanism of enhanced resistance of Mycobacterium bovis BCG-treated mice to ectromelia virus infection was investigated by determining the effect of splenectomy, antithymocyte serum, and antimacrophage serum on resistance. It was greatly reduced by these treatments, not only in normal mice, but also in mice treated with live or heat-inactivated BCG. Production of circulating interferon by ectromelia virus and Newcastle disease virus was augmented in BCG-treated mice and was markedly depressed by splenectomy and antithymocyte and antimacrophage serum treatments in both BCG-treated and normal mice. Carbon clearance activity was activated in BCG-treated mice, but splenectomy did not influence phagocytic activity. These results suggest that augmented interferon production in the spleens of BCG-treated mice plays a major role in enhanced resistance. Other possible mechanisms are discussed.
