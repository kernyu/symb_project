Forty substances were tested for antialgal activity against Chlorella pyrenoidosa (Wis. 2005) and Phormidium inundatum (Wis. 1093). C. pyrenoidosa exhibited greater resistance to adverse effects of test compounds than did P. inundatum. Although several structurally unrelated compounds were inhibitory to both alga species, even at an initial concentration of 1.0 mg/liter, methylthio-s-triazines, ametryne, prometryne, and terbutryne, at 0.1 mg/liter, restricted growth to less than 25% of control (untreated) cultures. The methylthio-s-triazines were virtually chemically unreactive with free iodine. Inhibition of Staphylococcus aureus by free iodine dosages of 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 1.0 mg/liter was unaffected by the presence of 2.0 mg of terbutryne per liter.
