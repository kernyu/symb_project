Twenty eight adult male patients with acute uncomplicated falciparum malaria which showed RI or RII responses to quinine sulfate at the dosage of 600 mg 8 hourly for 7, 10 or 14 days were treated with a single dose of mefloquine (Lariam); 25 patients received 1000 mg, 2 received 750 mg and 1 received 500 mg. The initial response was good; there was no RII or RIII response. Three patients were lost to followup. Of 25 patients who stayed in the Bangkok Hospital for Tropical Diseases where there was no malaria transmission for 28-65 days, only one patient in the 1000 mg group had recrudescence on day 21. The cure rate was 96%. Our prospective study suggests that mefloquine was effective in the treatment of quinine resistant falciparum malaria and the risk of cross-resistance between quinine and mefloquine in P. falciparum in vivo is very low.
