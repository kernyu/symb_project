Cefoxitin was given intravenously to 20 children with the following acute bacterial infections: 10 cases of bronchopneumonia, 6 cases of urinary tract infection, 2 cases of cervical purulent lymphadenitis, 1 case of streptococcosis and 1 case of omphalitis. Clinical effectiveness was obtained in 16 cases out of 20 cases and bacteriological effectiveness in 11 strains out of 15 strains. No side effect was observed except for 1 case with eruption and 1 case with slight elevation of GOT. From the above clinical results, it is apparent that cefoxitin is a useful antibiotic for treating pediatric patients with various kinds of bacterial infections.
