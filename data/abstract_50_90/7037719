Resistance to 15 antimicrobials was determined for Klebsiella spp, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus in 302, 370, and 344 samples. respectively, from cases of bovine mastitis, The degree of association of resistance for all 2-way combinations of antimicrobials was calculated for each organism. Significantly high and low associations were reported. An association greater than 1 indicated an increased probability of resistance to the 2nd antimicrobial of a 2-way combination, whereas an association less than 1 indicated a low probability of resistance to the 2nd antimicrobial.
