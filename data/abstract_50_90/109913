66 burned patients admitted to the Burn Unit from Jan. to Sept., 1977, were studied. Topical therapy employed was mafenide or silver sulfadiazine. The most common pathogens isolated in 288 burn wound cultures were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (42%), Klebsiella-Enterobacter (16%), and Staph, aureus (13%). Pseudomonas was sensitive to gentamicin in only 36.2% of instances. In 1976, 42% of Pseudomonas isolates was sensitive. During the period 1969-1973, 85.7% of the Pseudomonas was sensitive to gentamicin.
