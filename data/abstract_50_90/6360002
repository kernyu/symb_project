Staphylococcus epidermidis, an organism routinely found on the skin and in the hospital environment, has become a primary pathogen in infections associated with prosthetic devices. Because these infections are indolent and often clinically silent, diagnosis and therapy are often difficult. Pathogens are often misidentified as contaminants. Their variable, often resistant antibiotic susceptibility pattern and the uncertain correlation of in-vitro beta-lactam sensitivity testing with therapeutic efficacy make selection of an effective antibiotic regimen difficult. Vancomycin combined with rifampin, gentamicin, or both, is recommended for empiric therapy of these infections. Usually, removal of the prosthetic device is also necessary and may contribute equally to a successful therapeutic outcome.
