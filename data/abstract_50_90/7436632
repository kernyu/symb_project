Streptomycin inhibits significantly the bronchoconstrictor effects of bradykinin and histamine. This effect of streptomycin is probably through the relaxation of bronchiolar smooth muscle. The hypotensive and inflammatory responses to bradykinin and histamine are also significantly suppressed with streptomycin. This is thought to be due to the decreased vascular permeability to streptomycin.
