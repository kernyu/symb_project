Eight gentamicin-resistant Escherichia coli were identified from among 630 E. coli strans isolated from parenteral infections. All eight strains were multiply resistant and harbored R plasmids mediating gentamicin resistance. The R plasmids specified the formation of two types of aminoglycoside-inactivating enzymes AAD (2") and APH (3').
