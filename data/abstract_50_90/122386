A study of 320 samples of mammary quarters from cows in 40 dairy farms around Santa Fe city during 1977-1978 was made. The samples were selected based on clinical examination and California Mastitis Test (GMT). High percentage of subclinical mastitis was found. The etiological agents most frequently isolated were Staphylococcus aureus (54,1%), Streptococcus agalactiae (23.4%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (13,2%). A winter increment of S. aureus (48,1%) and P. aeruginosa (3,7% and 22,5%) was observed. But S. agalactiae did not experiment considerable variation (26,8% and 20% throughout the year. The sensitivity to antibiotics of some strains decreased in winter specially in S. aureus and P. aeruginosa (61,5% and 38,9%), and some biochemical properties related with their virulence increased. Penicillin in milk was not detected, but the levels of contamination by non specific inhibitory substances were very high (40%). Besides it was found a great contamination with aerobic sporeforming bacteria in these samples, being Bacillus coagulans (59,1%), B. polymyxa (26,1%) and B. sphaericus (9,5%) the most frequent.
