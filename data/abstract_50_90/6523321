Use of thiamphenicol for the treatment of uncomplicated gonococcal urethritis was evaluated in 96 cases occurring between 1971 and 1975 and in 60 cases occurring between 1982 and 1983. Results in both groups of patients were nearly identical. Evidence indicates that gonococcal strains have not developed resistance to thiamphenicol during the ten years of its use. Thiamphenicol is still a highly effective agent for the treatment of gonococcal urethritis.
