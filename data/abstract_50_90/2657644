The properties of several new, investigational quinolones are reviewed. Desirable characteristics of new quinolones are improved activity against especially Gram-positive bacteria, longer elimination half-life, slower development of resistance, fewer side effects etc. Fleroxacin and lomefloxacin have entered phase III trials: their main advantage lies in improved pharmacokinetics. AM-1091, AT-4140 and T-3262 are still in early phases of development and show improved activity against Gram-positive bacteria. They also show a reduced penetration of the blood-brain barrier, probably resulting in fewer side effects in the central nervous system. AM-1091 shows incomplete cross-resistance with ciprofloxacin.
