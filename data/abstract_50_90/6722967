The authors have tested for Salmonella in 3,378 samples collected over a period of 17 months in the Central African Republic. They have isolated 127 strains of Salmonella (S. typhi not included). These Salmonella are distributed according to 41 serotypes, one of which is new. They have tested the sensitivity of all the isolated strains to different antibiotics and they have noted that the 5 animal strains and 5.7% of the human strains were resistant to chloramphenicol. They discuss the epidemiological importance of these facts.
