We review some aspects of the epidemiology of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) in the developing countries of Africa and Latin America. Apart from their elevated prevalence, they are responsible for important morbidity in mother and child. Stillbirth, premature delivery, conjunctivitis, and respiratory tract morbidity of the neonate are frequently caused by STDs. Sequelae in adult women include pelvic inflammatory disease, ectopic pregnancy, and infertility. The emergence of antimicrobial resistance has complicated the picture in recent times. Genital ulcer disease is very common in developing countries, the most important being chancroid. Both continents are experiencing major epidemics of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection with different epidemiological characteristics than in the industrialized world. A link might exist between the high prevalence of STDs and the rapid heterosexual spread of HIV infection.
