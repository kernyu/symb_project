The aerobic flora of the axilla and forehead of 20 normal human subjects was studied through a 3-week course of 600 mg of demethylchlortetracycline daily and a 3-week follow-up. In general in the axilla, an initial fall in bacterial density was followed by recovery in numbers due to the proliferation of resistant coagulase-negative cocci and diminution of the lipophilic diphtheroid group of bacteria within 1 week of treatment. During the remainder of the treatment period, the flora was essentially stable in both density and composition. In the follow-up phase, the initial flora was slowly re-established but resistant cocci persisted for more than 3 weeks. On the forehead the fall in density was slower and recovery during treatment was incomplete. Resistant coagulase-negative cocci became dominant and persisted through the follow-up phase. In two individuals, temporary colonization of the axilla by Staphylococcus aureus was seen.
