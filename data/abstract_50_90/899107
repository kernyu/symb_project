Report on two cases with chronic folliculitis of the face, resistant to antibiotic therapy. In both cases Staphylococcus epidermidis was the only organism that could be isolated. After a comparatively short treatment with levamisole (150 mg on two successive days weekly) the lesions cleared completely.
