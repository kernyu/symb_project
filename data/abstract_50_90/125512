Although the preponderant majority of gonococcal strains is belonging to the most susceptible micro-organisms in respect of the action of antibiotics, certain variations of sensitivity which might be of importance not only for the genetics of microbes, but also for biochemistry and, above all, for therapy may occur also among them, perhaps as a consequence of along-time pressure by antibiotics. In a preceding study (J. Hyg. Epidem. Microb. Immunol. (Prague) 12,296, 1968), the authors analyzed the situation in Czechoslovakia from 1957 to 1967 by means of 911 strains of N. gonorrhoeae isolated from male patients suffering from gonorrhoea. It was also pointed out that there was a certain tendency towards reduced efficacy of penicillin G and a presence of streptomycin-resistant strains. In later years, the studies were extended to include also strains isolated from female patients and sensitivity to some more modern antibiotics was tested. In the present report, a survey is given of the state of antibiotics resistance among gonococci in Czechoslovakia in a chronological order of 17 years which is intended to serve as a basic information for those who are dealing with this subject.
