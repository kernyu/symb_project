Two genetically distinct classes of norfloxacin-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO4009 mutants were isolated spontaneously. Two norfloxacin resistance genes, nfxA and nfxB, were mapped hex-9001 and leu-9005 and between pro-9031 and ilv-9023, respectively, on the P. aeruginosa PAO chromosome. The nfxA gene was shown to be an allele of nalA by transductional analysis with bacteriophage F116L. The nfxB mutant showed a 16-fold increase in resistance to norfloxacin and a slight increase in resistance to nalidixic acid. The nfxB mutant was unique in that it showed hypersusceptibility to beta-lactam and aminoglycoside antibiotics. This mutant had about a threefold-lower rate of norfloxacin uptake than that of the wild-type strain or nfxA mutant. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of outer membrane proteins demonstrated the appearance of a 54,000-dalton protein in the nfxB mutant. These findings suggested that the norfloxacin resistance mechanism in the nfxB mutant might be an alteration in outer membrane permeability to norfloxacin.
