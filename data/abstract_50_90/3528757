A new class of rifamycin-resistant mutants of Escherichia coli was obtained by lysogenic insertions of bacteriophage Mu Amp DNA. Rifamycin resistance is closely linked to the ampicillin resistance conferred by the prophage. Mapping by conjugation with auxotrophic markers revealed that the rifamycin-resistant mutations are located between 28 and 37 min on the E. coli chromosome standard map, some distance from the rpoB gene at 89.5 min. The DNA-dependent RNA polymerase of these mutants is highly sensitive to rifampicin.
