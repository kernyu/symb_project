This short review focuses on the immunological functions of iron-containing compounds. Five such compounds--transferrin, haptoglobin, hemopexin, albumin, and lactoferrin--are thought to contribute to normal infection resistance. Experimental results that demonstrate the ability of these compounds to inhibit the growth of an important pathogen, Klebsiella pneumoniae, are discussed.
