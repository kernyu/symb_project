Multiple-drug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains are gaining prominence because of their ability to colonize and infect patients, their facility for spreading rapidly throughout hospitals and their limited antibiotic sensitivity. Traditional antistaphylococcal drugs, such as the penicillinase-resistant semisynthetic penicillins and the cephalosporins, may be ineffective therapy for these infections. Heteroresistance to most other antibiotics, including the aminoglycosides at times, has reestablished vancomycin as a valuable drug for these resistant pathogens.
