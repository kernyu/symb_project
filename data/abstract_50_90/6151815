The potential of bambermycins (a growth-promoting antimicrobial approved for turkeys, broilers, and swine) to overcome or control plasmid-mediated antimicrobial resistance was determined in a series of in vitro experiments. Four possible modes of action of bambermycins were studied: synergistic effect with 12 other antimicrobials, elimination of resistance (R) plasmids from Escherichia coli, selective killing or inhibition of E coli carrying R plasmids, and inhibition of R plasmid transfer. Bambermycins had no synergistic activity with the other drugs tested and had little effect on eliminating plasmids from host bacteria. Dependent on plasmid type, bambermycins decreased or increased transfer frequency of R plasmids. Bambermycins also selectively inhibited growth of bacteria harboring certain R plasmids.
