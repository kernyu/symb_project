UNLABELLED: In blood-free perfused isolated rabbit lungs increased availability of free arachidonic acid (AA), whether exogenously applied or released from the endogenous membrane phospholipid pool after different stimuli, causes an acute pulmonary artery pressor response and an increase in vascular permeability. Previous experiments suggested that the vasoconstriction is caused primarily by the cyclooxygenase product thromboxane (Tx) A2, whereas an increase in the capillary filtration coefficient must be ascribed to non-cyclooxygenase products of AA. The influence of BM 13.177, a non-prostanoic antagonist of TxA2- and endoperoxide-effects in platelets, on the AA-induced vascular effects in isolated rabbit lungs was investigated. BM 13.177 dose-dependently inhibited the pressor responses evoked by repetitive direct application of AA (IC50 approximately 10(-6) M) or by repetitive stimulation of endogenous AA-release with the calcium-ionophore A 23187 (IC50 approximately 10(-7) M), with maximum reduction of the pressor responses to less than 15%. The generation of TxA2 and of prostaglandin (PG) I2 evoked by these stimuli was, however, not altered. At a concentration of 10(-5) M BM 13.177 did not influence the capillary filtration coefficient, measured during venous pressure challenge, under baseline conditions and after stimulation with AA in presence of indomethacin. CONCLUSION: BM 13.177 acts as TxA2/endoperoxide antagonist with dose-dependent inhibition of AA-induced vasoconstriction in the pulmonary vascular bed.
