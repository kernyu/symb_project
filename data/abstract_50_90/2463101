Experiments were designed to test the presence of antitumor natural resistance (NR) in DBA/2 mice against highly oncogenic in vivo passaged histocompatible Friend leukemia cells (FLC-V). NR was measured in vivo as rapid clearance of radiolabeled cells from different organs or as growth inhibition in lethally irradiated mice. Interferon-sensitive (745) or interferon-resistant (3C18) lines were used. Organ clearance studies showed that young recipients eliminate cells more rapidly than old mice. Moreover, depressive (e.g., cyclophosphamide or carrageenen) or enhancing (e.g., poly (I:C) or Friend leukemia virus infection) agents of NR function modulate accordingly leukemia cell clearance. Similar results were obtained testing tumor growth in lethally irradiated hosts, although modulating agents were substantially less effective in this system. Both FLC-745-V and FLC-3C18-V lines were equally susceptible to NR. Therefore, these data provide further support to the hypothesis that exogenous IFN capable of suppressing the growth of both lines could act via enhancement of the NR function.
