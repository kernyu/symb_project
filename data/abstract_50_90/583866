Fosfomycin, a nontoxic broad-spectrum antibiotic, different in structure from all previously described antibiotics, acts selectively by inhibiting cell wall formation. It was overlooked during many years of screening because of antagonism by culture medium ingredients and frequent occurrence of resistant mutants. It is effective in many because the neutralizing substances are not present and resistant mutants of most species are avirulent. Fosfomycin has favorable pharmacologic characteristics. It is not cross resistant, does not show antagonism, and has been used successfully in combinations. An insoluble calcium salt is used in oral formulation and a sodium salt for parenteral administration. Overall success rates of 86% were reported with 1,000 patients in Spain and 79% in Japan.
