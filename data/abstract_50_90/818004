Considerable advances have been made in antimicrobial susceptibility testing. This review emphasizes the continued efforts toward standardization of methods for dilution and diffusion testing, particularly in the area of variation in medium performance, methods for detection of ampicillin resistant Haemophilus influenzae, and attempts to develop rapid automated systems for susceptibility testing. Susceptibility testing of anaerobes continues to be controversial from the standpoint of both the selection of methods and the application of susceptibility results to the clinical situation. It is expected that these and other problems in susceptibility testing will be solved by continued application of the investigative approaches that have brought us where we are today.
