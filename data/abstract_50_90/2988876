By multistep selection a set of clones and sublines possessing different levels of resistance to colchicine or adriablastin was obtained from the SV40-transformed Djungarian hamster cell lines, DM-15 and DMcap. Resistance to both colchicine and adriablastin is associated with an alteration of plasma membrane permeability leading to a decreased uptake of various drugs (3H-colchicine, 3H-cytochalasin B, 3H-actinomycin D, 3H-puromycin, 3H-vinblastine, 14C-chloramphenicol). The DNA of cells highly resistant to cholchicine can transmit resistance only to low dosages of the drug. Comparison of DNAs from wild-type and resistant cells digested by restriction endonucleases revealed new classes of repeated DNA sequences in resistant cell lines. The degree of DNA repetition was correlated with the level of drug resistance. The repeated DNA sequences evidently represent parts of the genome that are amplified in resistant cells. The size of the amplified sequences is 200-250 kilobase pairs (kb). Cell lines highly resistant to colchicine contain amplified DNA, which like mitochondrial DNA replicate asynchronously with the main portion of the cellular DNA and related but not identical DNA sequences are amplified in independent cell lines selected for resistance to colchicine, adriablastin, and actinomycin D. These cell lines display similar patterns of alterations of plasma membrane permeability. The amplified DNA sequences may contain a gene or genes the overexpression of which leads to change in plasma membrane permeability and a development of resistance to various drugs.
