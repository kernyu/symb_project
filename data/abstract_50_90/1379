Rifampin-resistant mutants were isolated from Lactobacillus casei S1 and examined for possible simultaneous alteration in nutritional properties. Among the 36 mutants obtained either spontaneously or after mutagenesis with 2-aminopurine, 22 were found to be altered with respect to the specific growth requirements. The majority (20 of 22) of the latter mutants were shown to require L-glutamine in addition to the nutrients required by the parental strain for maximal growth, whereas the remaining mutants had apparently lost the requirement for L-aspartate. Further studies with one of the glutamine-requiring mutants revealed that the rifampin resistance of this strain is due to the resistance of ribonucleic acid polymerase itself and that a single mutation is responsible for both rifampin resistance and the glutamine requirement. These results strongly indicate that a structural alteration of the ribonucleic acid polymerase caused by the rifampin resistance mutation somehow affected glutamine metabolism, possibly through change in selective transcription of the genes involved.
