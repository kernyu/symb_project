The successful transfer of a marker gene (hpt gene) from Brassica nigra into B. napus via direct gene transfer was demonstrated. Total DNA was isolated from a hygromycin-resistant callus line, which contained three to five copies of the hpt gene. This line had been produced via direct gene transfer with the hygromycin resistance-conferring plasmid pGL2. The treatment of B. napus protoplasts with genomic DNA of B. nigra (HygR) resulted in relative transformation frequencies of 0.1-0.4%. Similar transformation rates were obtained in direct gene transfer experiments using B. napus protoplasts and plasmid pGL2.
