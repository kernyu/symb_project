A spectinomycin resistance mutation was isolated in an Escherichia coli rRNA operon (rrnH) located on a multicopy plasmid. Cell-free protein-synthesizing extracts made from cells containing the plasmid were partially resistant to spectinomycin. Although spectinomycin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic, the mutation did not confer resistance to any other aminoglycoside antibiotic tested.
