The borohydride reduction of glyoxylic acid induced fluorescence in noradrenergic and DOPA-minergic nervous structures and in amines in model experiments was studied. Both DOPAmine and noradrenaline fluorescences were resistant to borohydride reduction differing thus from the formaldehyde-induced fluorescence. Thus when the specificity of glyoxylic acid induced fluorescence is in doubt, other tests than borohydride reduction of the fluorescence must be employed.
