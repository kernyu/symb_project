Antibiotic susceptibilities of 22 strains of Escherichia coli isolated from children from 0 to 3 years old at the University Hospital of Puebla were determined. Almost all strains were resistant to ampicillin, tetracycline, streptomycin, and kanamycin. Gel electrophoresis of DNA from 10 clinical strains of E. coli revealed a heterogeneous plasmid population. Plasmid DNA, ranging in molecular mass from 1.8 to 120 megadaltons, was demonstrated in 10 strains. Moreover, the frequency of antibiotic transfer ranged from 1.6/10(8) to 2/10, and the simultaneous transfer of the gene encoding heat-stable enterotoxin was also determined. Six out of 10 strains tested were able to cotransfer ST-a as demonstrated by the suckling mouse test. It is possible that antibiotic selective pressure may increase the isolation of enterotoxigenic E. coli strains.
