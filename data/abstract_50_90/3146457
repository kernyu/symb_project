The multiple-drug-resistance property of Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) is mainly attributed to a cell envelope permeability barrier. MAC treated with subinhibitory levels of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (disodium salt) (EDTA) did not have altered minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) levels or show ultrastructural changes; the effect of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) was variable. With SDS, the visualization of the nucleoid and ribosomes decreased, and amorphous electron-dense material accumulated near the structurally altered cytoplasmic membrane and cell wall. Use of 0.005% Tween-80 resulted in a 2-4-fold reduction in MIC in the case of rifampicin, ansamycin (LM 427), cephapirin, and ciprofloxacin. Tween-80 treated cells were swollen, and deposits of low electron-density accumulated in the cytoplasm; distortions in the outer-cell integuments were observed. These findings are consistent with the idea that Tween-80 increases cell-envelope permeability, thereby enhancing drug penetrability and reducing MIC levels. Because of the action of Tween-80, its use in drug-susceptibility media or diluent fluids should be avoided.
