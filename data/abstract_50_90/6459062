Mercury resistance shown by a strain of Enterobacter aerogenes was found to be determined by a plasmid. The resistance appeared to be not due to enzymatic volatilization of mercury, but due to the alteration in cellular permeability to mercury. Comparison of the outer membrane proteins was made between the resistant cells and the sensitive counterparts obtained by the treatment with mitomycin C, showing that two proteins with molecular weight of 46,000 and 44,000 had disappeared from the outer membrane along with the plasmid by the curing. These results suggest that the two membrane proteins mediating the cellular permeability to mercury compound may be responsible for the mercury resistance of the strain.
