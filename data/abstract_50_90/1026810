84 patients of leprosy including 15 female patients were treated with Clofzimine on a predetermined dosage regimen. 76 of these were cases of recurrent lepra reaction; 4 cases of proven DDS resistance, 3 of these being complicated by lepra reaction; and 4 were cases of reactional state in Borderline leprosy near the lepromatous end of the spectrum. The common side effect in all cases consisted of red and dark skin pigmentation of varying intensity occuring within 10 weeks of the commencement of therapy. The intensity of the colour was proportionate to the density of the infiltration. Ichthyosis occurred in 66.6% of cases. While the pigmentation was accepted by the patients in general, 10% of the patients considered ichthyosis as stigmatising. While side effects like anorexia, diarrhoea, enlargement of lymph glands and liver, corneal xerosis and loss of weight were self correcting, severe gastrointestinal manifestation, i.e. severe abdominal pain, vomiting and diarrhoea were observed in 9 patients, 5 of whom were females. Mortality was high in the females. On an incidental finding the Isonizair reduced the severity of the manifestations, it was supplemented in 10 cases on Clofazimine therapy and was found to minimise the side effects and the pigmentation due to Clofazimine. Hydration therapy for the ichthyosis and instillation of normal saline and liquid paraffin for corneal xerosis were found to be very useful.
