During the year 1977, 1491 urine samples were taken from patients living in the "Alta Valle del Tevere" (Umbria, Italy). The isolated microorganisms were examined and tested against 15 antibiotics. 535 samples (35.88%) were free from bacteria. Among the 1095 isolates, 52.42% were Gram-negative, 46.85% Gram-positive, and only 0.73% Fungi. The genera Citrobacter, Escherichia, Proteus, Pseudomonas, Enterobacter, Klebsiella, Staphylococcus and Enterococcus were identified. A high proportion of strains belonging to the genera Proteus and Pseudomonas were resistant to all the 15 antibiotics tested. However, although in a lower proportion, the multiple drug-resistance was present also in the strains of the genera Escherichia and Staphylococcus.
