In Nigeria chloroquine remains the drug of choice for the treatment of falciparum malaria, since chloroquine resistance is not yet a problem. Nevertheless, in view of the rapid spread of multi-resistant Plasmodium falciparum in Africa it is desirable to test alternative drugs for efficacy and safety. To this end, we undertook a comparative controlled trial of the new triple combination, mefloquine-sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (MSP, Fansimef) with chloroquine in a group of Nigerian children with symptomatic falciparum malaria. Our results showed that Fansimef was an effective blood schizontocide against the Nigerian strain of P. falciparum and was well tolerated. In particular, sinus bradycardia, which was frequently observed with Fanismef in the trials conducted in Zambia, was not seen in any of the Nigerian patients. In vitro sensitivity tests done on 26 P. falciparum isolates showed that all isolates were susceptible to complete inhibition by mefloquine, but the minimum concentration which produced complete inhibition in some isolates was higher than expected for fully sensitive parasites.
