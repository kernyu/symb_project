The interaction between the killer toxin of Pichia kluyveri 1002 and cells of Saccharomyces cerevisiae SCF 1717 is strongly affected by the physiological state of sensitive cells. The killing effect is maximal for cells in the lag and early exponential phase of growth, whereas stationary cells are completely resistant. Furthermore, sensitivity is markedly enhanced by a rise of the pH (from 3.2 to 6.8) at which cells are cultured. Three successive stages can be distinguished in the killing process: (I) binding of the toxin to the primary binding site; (II) transmission of the toxin to its reactive site in the plasma membrane; (III) occurrence of functional damage (K+-leakage; decrease of intracellular pH). The transition from stage I to II is prevented in the absence of metabolic energy or at low temperature (below 10 degrees C). Sensitive cells in stage I can be rescued from toxin-induced killing by a short incubation at pH 7.0, which treatment is not effective for cells in stage II. Cells in stage II are able to resume growth when plated in a rich medium containing suitable concentrations of potassium and hydrogen ions. Rescue was not observed for cells in stage III of the killing process.
