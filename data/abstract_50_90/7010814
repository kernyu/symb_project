The water plant Lemna perpusilla has been incubated with the E. coli plasmids pMB9 and pBR325, respectively. Uptake of plasmids has been shown by subsequent transformation of E. coli cells to tetracycline resistance after treatment with Lemna DNA from plasmid-incubated plants. In 7 out of 15 assays we found stable transformants. From the transformation rate an amount of 10(-4) to 10(-6) micrograms plasmid DNA per 10 micrograms of plant DNA can be calculated.
