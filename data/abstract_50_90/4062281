Antibiotic sensitivity of 218 pneumococcal strains isolated from sputum of 140 patients with chronic bronchitis and 78 patients with infectious and allergic bronchial asthma in Tomsk at the period from September 1981 to March 1984 was studied by the agar diffusion method with the use of standard sensitivity disks. A significant number of the isolates were resistant or little sensitive to tetracycline (54 per cent) and monomycin (42 per cent). It should be noted that 5.5 per cent of the pneumococcal strains were resistant or little sensitive to benzylpenicillin. The decreased sensitivity of the pneumococcal strains to many of the widely used antibiotics and especially occurrence of benzylpenicillin resistant strains require determination of the sensitivity of the pneumococcal strains isolated from each patient with aggravation of chronic bronchitis and infectious and allergic bronchial asthma.
