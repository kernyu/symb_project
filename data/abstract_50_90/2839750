pTK159, a multiresistance 40-kilobase (kb) plasmid, was isolated from a clinical strain of Serratia marcescens. pTK159 was nonconjugative and carried determinants for resistance to amikacin, streptomycin/spectinomycin, sulfamethoxazole and ampicillin. A physical and functional map of pTK159 was constructed. By cloning various fragments of pTK159 in pACYC184 or pBR322, genes for resistance to amikacin, streptomycin/spectinomycin, and sulfamethoxazole were found to be located on a 2.0-kb BamHI-HindIII fragment, a 1.4-kb HindIII fragment and a 2.1-kb HindIII fragment, respectively. The map of pTK159 was compared with published maps of amikacin-resistance determinants and transposons.
