In this simplified microbiological assay for serum vitamin B12, Lactobacillus leichmanii (NCIB 8117) adapted to tolerate high concentrations (500 mg/L) of the polymyxin antibiotic colistin sulfate is used. Results were similar in parallel experiments in which we used both the parent strain of L. leichmanii (NCIB 8117), and the new adapted strain. Evaluation of assay performance showed excellent analytical recovery of added cyanocobalamin (97%, SD 3%) and good interassay and intra-assay precision (CV less than 5%). This modified assay system obviates the need to sterilize culture medium and glassware. Consequently, assay manipulations may be carried out openly, without aseptic precautions. Moreover, this adapted organism would be suitable for use in an automated microbiological assay system.
