To study patterns of resistance at extreme but nevertheless clinically relevant drug concentrations, we developed a series of methotrexate-selected CCRF-CEM sublines, all of which were highly resistant to this antifolate (relative resistance, 10(2)- to greater than 10(5)-fold). The least methotrexate-resistant subline was completely sensitive to drugs associated with the multidrug resistance phenotype. However, more highly methotrexate-resistant sublines were significantly cross-resistant to vincristine, vinblastine, and dactinomycin (maximum relative resistance, 40-fold). These sublines were not cross-resistant to doxorubicin, daunorubicin, and teniposide. Regression analysis indicated that relative resistance to methotrexate was correlated with relative resistance to vincristine (r = 0.96) and vinblastine (r = 0.99). Such cross-resistance in highly methotrexate-resistant cells may have important clinical implications.
