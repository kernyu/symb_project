Antistaphylococcal activity of two new quinolones, norfloxacin and pefloxacin, was studied. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined by the agar dilution technique for 312 staphylococcal strains, all of which were resistant to nalidixic acid. 50% and 90% MICs were respectively 1 and 4 micrograms/ml for norfloxacin and 0.5 and 1 micrograms/ml for pefloxacin. Activities of these two new quinolones proved similar on Staphylococcus aureus and non-coagulase-producing staphylococci, regardless of their response to methicillin. Cross resistance between the two drugs was demonstrated.
