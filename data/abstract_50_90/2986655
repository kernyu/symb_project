MIC (minimal inhibitory concentration) determinations for nalidixic acid, cinoxacin, pipemidic acid, norfloxacin, enoxacin, and ciprofloxacin were done by agar dilution on isosensitest agar (oxoid). Bacterial strains investigated were 189 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 164 Acinetobacter lwoffii, 4 Ps. maltophilia, 3 Ps. putrefaciens and 3 Ps. odorans. The results in summary are: Ciprofloxacin is the most active gyrase inhibitor against Ps. aeruginosa as well as against other nonfermentative gram-negative rods, versus Ps. aeruginosa norfloxacin is a little more active than ofloxacin, against nonfermentative gram-negative rods other than Ps. aeruginosa norfloxacin is markedly less active than ofloxacin. Problems concerning cross-resistance of new gyrase inhibitors are discussed.
