The unstable feature of ristomycin resistance in S. coelicolor A3 (2) was studied. It was shown that the frequency of ristomycin-resistant derivatives was high in both chloramphenicol sensitive mutants and their resistant revertants. The 15- and 20-kb DNA sequences capable of amplifying were detected in the chloramphenicol resistant revertants. In the genomes of the studied strains they were represented by 50 and 40 copies, respectively.
