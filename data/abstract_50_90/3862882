We investigated the concentrations of cefmenoxime (CMX) after administration of 2 g of CMX, in the tissues resected during operation 2 hours after the beginning of intravenous drip infusion, and in the exudates from abdominal or thoracic cavities in the postoperative period. The results were as follows: The highest tissue concentration of CMX was found in the liver (59.0 +/- 20.3 micrograms/g), and the lowest was in the pancreas (13.9 +/- 8.1 micrograms/g). The concentrations of CMX in the tissues were in order of liver much greater than colon = esophagus = stomach greater than pancreas. The peak concentration of CMX in exudate from thoracic cavity was 15.6 +/- 10.1 micrograms/ml, and was observed 2 hours after the beginning of intravenous drip infusion, later than that in serum. Furthermore, the concentration of the exudate was maintained to a reasonable extent for 5 hours. The concentrations of CMX in both tissues and exudates were enough to inhibit the growth of many kinds of bacteria isolated from abdominal infections.
