Introduction of antibiotic-resistant bifidobacterial and lactobacterial strains, separately or together, does not decrease the degree and duration of contamination of the small intestine by enterobacteria after oral administration of antibiotics in large doses. The use of antibiotic-resistant bifidobacterial and lactobacterial strains allows one to decrease contamination of the small intestine by enterobacteria, resulting from the administration of antibiotics in near-therapeutic doses. The therapeutic effectiveness of bacterial preparations with respect to antibiotic dysbacteriosis has been found to depend on the level of resistance to the administered antibiotic. Antibiotic-resistant strains of bifidobacteria decrease the number of opportunistic microorganisms in the intestine in cases of dysbacteriosis caused by irradiation and administration of antibiotics.
