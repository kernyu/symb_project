The relative efficacy of 5-methoxymethyl-2'-deoxyuridine (MMdUrd), arabinosyladenine (ara-A) and the combination of MMdUrd and ara-A in the treatment of experimental genital herpes (GH) was investigated using mouse and guinea pig models. The infection was initiated by intravaginal inoculation using either HSV-2, strain X-265 or HSV-2, strain MS. Treatment was initiated 3 h post virus inoculation. The parameters used to evaluate efficacy were: percent mortality; mean day of death; virus yield from the vaginal secretions; and mean lesion score. The simultaneous application of 5% MMdUrd and 5% ara-A was an effective treatment for controlling primary GH in both animal models. Combination chemotherapy was also effective in preventing recurrence of infection as well as the emergence of drug resistant virus. At 20% concentration, ara-A was effective in providing protection against GH. However, lesions due to recurrent GH appeared after cessation of treatment and the virus isolated from vaginal secretions of ara-A treated animals required higher concentration of drug for inhibition of virus replication in cell culture. 20% MMdUrd was only partially effective in controlling GH. The production of infectious virus particles (virus yield) in cell culture after exposure to either ara-A of MMdUrd alone or in combination was determined. When MMdUrd and ara-A were used together, a substantially lower amount of each drug was needed to inhibit virus production completely and removal of drugs did not result in an increase in virus yield.
