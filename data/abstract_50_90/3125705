Ribosomal proteins from Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37 Rv were analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and 73 proteins were separated. The 30S subunit consists of 26 proteins, the 50S subunit of 41 proteins, 6 proteins of the ribosomes could not be shown in the subunits. The molecular weights for the proteins of the 30S subunit are 9100-43500, and for the proteins of the 50S subunit 8000-46000. The sedimentation coefficient have values of 28.8S and 47.7S. It was demonstrated that streptomycin-resistant cells in comparison to sensitive cells have two additional 30S proteins. Moreover, the protein L34 has changed its position. Kanamycin- and capreomycin-resistant cells have also two additional proteins, but viomycin shows no changes.
