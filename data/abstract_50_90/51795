1. Rifamazine (AF/RP) a dimeric rifamycin, is active against bacterial DNA-dependent RNA polymerase and against viral RNA-dependent DNA polymerase. 2. Rifamazine is active also against DNA-dependent RNA polymerase extracted from rifampicin-resistant mutants of Escherichia coli. It does not interfere with enzyme-template interaction or with RNA elongation. It blocks initiation. 3. A comparison is made between the mechanism of action of rifamazine and that of rifampicin, and of AF/013 (octyloxime of 3-formylrifamycin SV), a C-class rifamycin. Our results show that the mechanism of action of rifamazine is more similar to that of rifampicin than to that of the octyloxime derivative. 4. Activity of rifamazine against RNA polymerase from rifampicin-resistant mutants is thought to be due to binding of the dimer to both the rifamycin-specific binding site and to a second weak site.
