A transposable element, Tn2401, was found in a clinical isolate of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Tn2401 had a size of 7190 nucleotides and encoded aminoglycoside 3'-phosphotransferase and aminoglycoside 6'-N-acetyltransferase. The sequence encoding the former enzyme was homologous with that of Tn903. Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains harbouring this transposon were resistant to kanamycin, neomycin, lividomycin, ribostamycin, paromomycin, netilmycin, tobramycin, dibekacin, gentamicin, sisomicin, and butirosin.
