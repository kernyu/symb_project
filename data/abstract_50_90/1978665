The risk of malaria infection in airline crews is estimated to be 0.5 per 1,000 persons per night in areas with high levels of malaria transmission. Routine chemoprophylaxis for years is not recommended because of possible side effects. Airline crews should therefore use appropriate measures to prevent mosquito bites. In addition, they may need to carry "standby" medication with them to be used for presumptive treatment of a febrile illness if medical attention is not readily available.
