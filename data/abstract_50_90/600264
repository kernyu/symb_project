Proteins of cytoplasmic ribosomes of the Podospora anserina were analyzed by two dimensional gel electrophoresis. The numbers of proteins were estimated to be 28 in the small subunit and 41 in the large subunit. The L21 protein of the large subunit was found to migrate differently in a cycloheximide resistant mutant.
