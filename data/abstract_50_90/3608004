Data are presented on 633 strains of Shigella, and 197 strains of Salmonella, isolated in Bujumbura, capital of Burundi, between 1980 and 1985. The epidemiology of shigellosis is dominated by the resurgence of the Shiga bacillus and by its increasing resistance against all available antibacterial drugs. Salmonellosis is caused by a limited range of serotypes, most of them, with the exception of the typhoid bacillus, becoming multiresistant. Bacteriaemia with S. enteritidis is a frequent complication in patients with AIDS.
