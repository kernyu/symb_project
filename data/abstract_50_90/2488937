The recovery of beta-hemolytic streptococci from throat specimens, from November 1, 1988 to January 6, 1989, was analyzed. Beta-hemolytic streptococci were isolated from 927 of the 5050 throat cultures (18.4%). The rate of isolation of bacitracin-resistant beta-hemolytic streptococci was 9.6%. The frequency of group B, C, D, F and G beta-hemolytic streptococci was found 14.6%, 38.2%, 3.4%, 1.1% and 42.7% respectively. All strains were susceptible to penicillin, erythromycin and clindamycin.
