The antibiotic resistance of Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci has been followed over 4 years (1977-1980). 90% of the strains produced beta-lactamase. Coagulase-negative staphylococci were more resistant than S. aureus, although beta-lactamase production occurred more rarely. Strains from the sputum of children with cystic fibrosis (CF) were more multiresistant than isolates from other sources. The strains from hospitalized patients (HP) were more resistant than isolates from out-patients. A higher frequency of beta-lactamase production occurred among strains from CF and HP patients compared to out-patients. This occurred in samples from pus and wounds in 66% of the strains derived from non-hospitalized patients compared with 93% from surgical patients.
