Three plasmids designated alpha, beta, and gamma, distinguishable by their molecular weights (6, 17, and 34 million, respectively) were isolated from Streptococcus faecalis strain DS-5 (ATCC 14508). Derivatives of this strain "cured" for erythromycin resistance lacked the beta-plasmid. In the parent strain the beta-plasmid was estimated to be present to the extent of one to two copies per chromosomal genome equivalent whereas the alpha- and gamma-plasmids were about nine and five copies, respectively.
