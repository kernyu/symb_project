Achromobacter xylosoxidans is a rare cause of bacteremia. A case of community-acquired pneumonia and bacteremia due to Achromobacter in a patient with concomitant pulmonary tuberculosis is reported herein. The majority of patients who have developed achromobacter bacteremia have had a predisposition to infection (although the predisposing conditions have been diverse). Immunosuppression has been reported in only one of the seven patients with achromobacter bacteremia for whom detailed information is available. Achromobacter is usually resistant to ampicillin, cephalosporins, and aminoglycosides. Antipseudomonal penicillins and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole inhibit most isolates. Multiple-drug resistance is common, and optimal therapy is not known.
