Escherichia coli K-12 mutants that are resistant to bacteriophage chi, defective in motility, and unable to grow at high temperature (42 degrees C) were isolated from among those selected for rifampin resistance at low temperature (30 degrees C) after mutagenesis with N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine. Genetic analysis of one such mutant indicated the presence of two mutations that probably affect the beta subunit of ribonucleic acid (RNA) polymerase: one (rif) causing rifampin resistance and the other (Ts-74) conferring resistance to phage chi (and loss of motility) and temperature sensitivity for growth. Observations with an electron microscope revealed that the number of flagella per mutant cell was significantly reduced, suggesting that the Ts-74 mutation somehow affected flagella formation at the permissive temperature. When a mutant culture was transferred from 30 to 42 degrees C, deoxyribonucleic acid synthesis accelerated normally, but RNA or protein synthesis was enhanced relatively little. The rate of synthesis of beta and beta' subunits of RNA polymerase was low even at 30 degrees C and was further reduced at 42 degrees C, in contrast to the parental wild-type strain. Expression of the lactose and other sugar fermentation operons, as well as lysogenization with phage lambda, occurred normally at 30 degrees C, suggesting that the mutation does not cause general shut-off of gene expression regulated by cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate.
