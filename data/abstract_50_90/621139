Procedures to estimate cell-to-cell spread of tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) infection in mechanically inoculated leaves are presented mathematically and experimentally. Based upon the mathematical estimation, it is demonstrated that resistance of TMV infection to 2-thiouracil and guanidine in mechanically inoculated leaves is correlated to the fraction of cells infected. The addition of 2-thiouracil or guanidine prevents cell-to-cell spread of TMV infection.
