The results of sensitivity testing from the last 4 years of the enterobacteria isolates have been evaluated for ampicillin, cephalothin, gentamicin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. There was a remarkable decrease of cephalothin resistant E. coli, proteus mirabilis, and klebsiella strains. The number of strains resistant to ampicillin was only decreased in the case of proteins mirabilis. The resistance frequency to gentamicin was unchanged. In contrast, an increasing number of resistant strains of E. coli and proteins mirabilis was observed with regard to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.
