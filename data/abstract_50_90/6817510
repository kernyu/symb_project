Comparative studies were carried out with 8 antibiotics, furazolidon, and 9 disinfection agents with regard to the sensitivity of a total of 14 strains of Listeria monocytogenes. The agents used were the most commonly employed ones in the practice in routinely applied concentrations. It was found that L. monocytogenes strains isolated from sheep had good sensitivity to the action of erythromycin, and penicillin, and were more slightly sensitive to chloramphenicol, gentamycin, tetracycline, and furazolidon. They were resistant to streptomycin and polymixin M. Good disinfection action against L. monocytogenes were shown to have formalin, phesiaform and partly phasiacept. Lower was the effect of sodium hydrate, proserine, and abosanite, while potassium permanganate, creolin, and chloramine did not show any bactericidal action.
