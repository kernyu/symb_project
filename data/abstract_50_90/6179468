Cyclosporin A (CyA) interfered locally at the site of injection with several resistance functions which are of potential importance in experimental herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections of mice. HSV-induced stimulation of macrophage phagocytosis was reduced by CyA when the mice were infected 5 days before the assay. The in vitro replication of the virus in macrophages, however, was enhanced. Natural killer (NK) cell response were severely impaired. To some extent this could be attribute to the induction of suppressive macrophages by the drug treatment. Interferon levels induced by HSV were not diminished but rather enhanced in some experiments. Inhibitory effects ceased after termination of CyA treatment and could be prevented by presensitization of the mice with attenuated HSV type 2.
