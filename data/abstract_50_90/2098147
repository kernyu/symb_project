In 200 strains of Candida sp, 38.5% were found to have intermediate sensitivity or to be resistant to amphotericin B and/or 5-fluorocytosine by the agar diffusion method. When the minimal inhibitory concentrations of these strains were measured, only 7.8% were resistant to amphotericin B and 2.8% to 5-fluorocytosine. The species with the highest levels of resistance were C. parapsilosis, C. tropicalis and Torulopsis glabrata. Candida albicans did not show resistance to 5-fluorocytosine.
