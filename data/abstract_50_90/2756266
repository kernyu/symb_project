This paper describes the frequency of susceptibility of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria against antibacterial agents. The data are based on all susceptibility tests performed at the Department of Medical Microbiology of the University of Zurich. The evaluation of the results from 1975 to 1987 shows that susceptibility against standard antimicrobial agents has not decreased in this period. These tables may be a valuable help for the physician in his decision for a "calculated chemotherapy".
