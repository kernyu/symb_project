The structural and regulatory tetracycline resistance genes of transposon Tn10 are located on a 2,700-base pair HpaI fragment. We have used eight tetracycline-sensitive mutations in the 2,700-base pair fragment, cloned into two compatible plasmids, to demonstrate that two complementation groups are required for tetracycline resistance. By genetic recombination with plasmids containing the regulatory or structural regions for resistance, we have determined that both complementation groups reside within the structural region. The complementation groups, designated tetA and tetB, are proximal and distal, respectively, to the promoter for the tetracycline resistance structural region. The tetB mutations are in the portion of the structural region that is known to encode the 36,000-molecular-weight, inner-membrane TET protein. The levels of tetracycline resistance expressed during complementation suggest a complex interaction between the products of the tetA and tetB loci.
