In the antimycin--resistant mutant anar-8 of the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe (Sch.p.) spontaneous mutants were isolated showing high resistance to the aminoglycoside antibiotic paromomycin. All mutants were resistant to the structurally related antibiotic neomycin. Tetrad analysis, mitotic segregation analysis, and mitotic haploidization revealed extrachromosomal, very likely mitochondrial inheritance. In contrast to the rapid segregation of mitochondrial markers in zygotic clones of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (S.c.) the heteroplasmic state of diploids proved to persist for at least 50 generations after zygote formation. Stationary cultures of the paromomycin-resistant mutants parr-106 and parr-112 contain up to 6% respiratory-deficient mutants, but no reversion to paromomycin-sensitivity was observed among 1700-1800 colonies tested. The ability of mutant anar-8 to produce spontaneously respiratory-deficient mutants could be separated from the antimycin-resistant phenotype of anar-8.
