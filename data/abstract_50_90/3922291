The therapeutic efficacy, tolerance and pharmacokinetics of sisomicin, gentamicin and a new dosage form of kanamycin sulfate as an ampoule solution for intravenous injection were studied clinically. High therapeutic efficacy of the above three aminoglycosides in the treatment of severe inflammatory infections caused by gram-negative bacteria was shown with the use of the adequate doses. Favourable results of the therapy estimated by the laboratory and clinical data were observed in 81-90 per cent of the patients.
