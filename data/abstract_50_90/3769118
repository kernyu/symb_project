Endemic cholera has been prevalent in Douala since 1972, with sudden epidemic outbreaks occurring every two years during the dry season. The massive and systematic use of chemoprophylaxis since April, 1983 has led to the selection of strains of Vibrio cholerae eltor that are resistant to sulphamide and tetracycline. During the 1984-1985 epidemic, 89.3% of the isolated strains were resistant to sulphamides, 87.5% to a sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim combination and to the 0/129 disk, 55.3% to tetracycline, 91.1% to chloramphenicol, 73.2% to streptomycin and 94.6% to ampicillin. The epidemic aspect of this multiple resistance to antibiotics raises the issue of the role of a group C incompatibility resistance plasmid. As regards prophylaxis, until hygiene conditions can be improved, which is the only way cholera can be eradicated from our region, vaccination with oral vaccines such as that of the Institut Pasteur seems to be the best way of preventing further epidemics.
