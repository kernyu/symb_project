Radioprotective thiols (five mercaptoalkylamines and four derived thiophosphates) induced interferon and resistance to virus infection. Interferon production occurred in human and mouse nonlymphoid cell cultures. One of the thiols, S,2-aminoethylisothiourea, given intraperitoneally, protected mice against two unrelated viruses--Semliki forest virus and Herpesvirus hominis type 1. Two structurally different radioprotective thiols--the disulfide cystamine and L-cysteine--were unable to induce the firus resistance state or interferon.
