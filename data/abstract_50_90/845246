The morphological and physiological characteristics of 593 strains of nonfermentative, gram-negative bacteria are described. A battery of 46 tests was used to identify and differentiate strains representing 8 genera and 31 species of named and group-designated bacteria. Seven selected amides and organic salts were closely examined to determine their usefulness, individually or as a battery, in characterizing and identifying the organisms. Of these, allantoin and acetamide showed the most promise in differentiating the more commonly occurring organisms from biochemically similar species. Susceptiblilty patterns to 12 antimicrobics also proved useful in differentiation, especially among atypical strains.
