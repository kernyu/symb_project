Two nonconjugative R-plasmids, N-SuSm and N-Tc, have been characterized. Both were of relatively small size (5 x 10(6) to 6 x 10(6) daltons) and present in multiple copies within their respective bacterial hosts. N-SuSm possessed a guanine plus cytosine content of 55%, whereas N-Tc was 49% guanine plus cytosine. Although these plasmids were inherently nontransmissible they could be mobilized by a large variety of transfer agents including Ent, Hly, and K88. The fi(-) transfer factors tested were far more likely (about 200x) to mobilize these nonconjugative plasmids than were the fi(+) transfer factors tested. Although the mobilization phenomenon was not found to be associated with a detectable level of direct stable recombinational union between N-SuSm or N-Tc with a transfer factor, we were able to demonstrate a low level of recombination between these replicons and a transfer factor by P1-mediated transduction. The isolation of recombinants between transfer factors and nonconjugative plasmids presumably represents one means by which unitary molecular types of R-plasmids arise and by which existing R-plasmids may acquire new resistance determinants.
