The fungus, Phycomyces blakesleeanus, shows many well-defined responses to a number of external stimuli. Genetic analysis shows that at least eight genes are involved in Phycomyces sensory transduction. As a first step toward the molecular analysis of these genes and their products, we have developed a transformation protocol for Phycomyces by using a plasmid containing the kanamycin-resistance gene from Tn903 and a Phycomyces DNA fragment capable of supporting autonomous replication in yeast (ARS). Our results demonstrate that the Tn903 gene is expressed in Phycomyces and that the ARS fragment selected in yeast supports autonomous replication in Phycomyces as well.
