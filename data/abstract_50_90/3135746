Acute septic infective endocarditis caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, in two patients with conditions that made it incurable, was treated with long-term orally administered ciprofloxacin. Bacteremia and symptoms cleared, resulting in subjective well-being without cure for three and one half and 22 months, respectively. Large amounts of ciprofloxacin, 150 and 1,440 g, respectively, were given continuously without apparent adverse reactions. Blood isolates of P. aeruginosa after treatment had limited progression of resistance to ciprofloxacin. Use of orally administered ciprofloxacin provides new opportunities for the long-term treatment of serious infections with restricted risk of bacterial drug resistance and no appreciable side effects.
