Cefodizime (THR-221, CDZM), a new parenteral cephalosporin, was evaluated for its efficacy and safety in 20 children with bacterial infections (Table 1), and the following results were obtained. 1. CDZM was administered in 3 or 4 divided doses at daily dosages ranging from 54.5 to 84.2 mg/kg administered by 30 minutes drip infusion or intravenous injection to 20 patients (7 cases of acute tonsillitis, 6 cases of pneumonia, 2 cases each of bronchitis and suppurative cervical lymphadenitis, and 1 case each of acute pharyngitis, acute enteritis and furunculosis) and the following clinical results were obtained: excellent, 7 cases; good, 11 cases; fair, 2 cases. The overall efficacy rate was 90% (Table 4). 2. MICs of CDZM against 15 strains of isolated organisms are shown in Table 2. MICs against all 7 strains of Haemophilus influenzae were less than 0.025 micrograms/ml. MIC against 1 out of 5 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae was 0.05 micrograms/ml and those against 2 strains were 0.10 micrograms/ml and against the other 2 were 0.20 micrograms/ml. MICs against 3 strains of Staphylococcus aureus were 1.56, 25 and higher than 100 micrograms/ml, respectively. 3. No clinical adverse reaction was observed in any of the 20 patients. Eosinophilia was observed in 2 cases. A slight elevation of S-GOT was found in 1 patient (case No. 8) and moderate elevation of S-GOT and S-GPT in another (case No. 18) (Table 4). In case No. 18, the S-GOT and S-GPT activity improved after the administration of the drug was stopped.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
