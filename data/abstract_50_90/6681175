The in vitro inhibitory activity of tinidazole, metronidazole, ornidazole, cefoxitin and moxalactam was determined against 150 isolates of clinically important anaerobes including Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides bivius and Clostridium perfringens by means of agar dilution tests. The members of 18 gramnegative and 14 grampositive species were inhibited by tinidazole at less than or equal to 0,01-8 micrograms/ml thus being without exception susceptible to the drug. A similar in vitro activity was recorded for metronidazole and ornidazole. Though cefoxitin and moxalactam generally had a good in vitro activity against most anaerobic species, single strains of Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, B. distasonis, Clostridium difficile and Eubacterium rectale were resistant to these drugs. With regard to its in vitro activity, tinidazole seems to be a promising substance for the therapy of anaerobic infections.
