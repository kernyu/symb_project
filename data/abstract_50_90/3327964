Laboratory and clinical studies were performed on a new oxacephem antibiotic, flomoxef (FMOX, 6315-S). In vitro antibacterial activity of FMOX was evaluated in comparison to latamoxef (LMOX), cefmetazole (CMZ), cefazolin (CEZ) using clinically isolated strains of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. Antibacterial activities of FMOX were stronger than LMOX, CMZ, CEZ against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella but only slightly effective against Staphylococcus aureus. This antibiotic drug was administered to 5 patients consisting of 2 cases with pneumonia, one each with pyelonephritis, chronic bronchitis and urinary tract infection. The drug was given in 1 g drip infusion twice a day for 8 to 13 days. Clinical efficacies of FMOX were excellent in 1 case, good in 2, fair in 1, and unevaluable in 1. As for bacteriological effect of FMOX, organisms were eradicated in 3 cases. No side effect was noted and there was no abnormal change in laboratory findings.
