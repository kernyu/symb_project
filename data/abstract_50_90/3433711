The effect of remantadine on the course of influenzal-staphylococcal infection was studied in white mice. When the drug was injected to the mice infected with remantadine-sensitive strain of influenza A virus and Staphylococcus the lethality decreased from 93.3% to 26.7%, the survival time increased from 3.8 to 10.1 days, the incidence of pneumonia decreased from 85.7% to 48.7%, the average intensity of pneumonia decreased from 66.4% to 9.9%, and virus titres in the lungs decreased by 3.5-4.0 lg EID50 (p less than 0.05). In the groups of mice infected with remantadine-resistant strain of influenza virus and Staphylococcus remantadine showed no significant effect on these parameters: the lethality decreased by 6.7% only, the average survival time increased only by 0.33 days, the incidence of pneumonia decreased by 9%, its intensity by 19.2%; influenza virus titres in the lung tissue did not change significantly.
