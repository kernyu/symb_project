The cyclization of 4-(p-tolyl)-selenosemicarbazides of acetic, benzoic, isonicotinic, nicotinic and picolinic acids (Ia-e) with omega-bromoacetophenone was investigated in the medium of methanol (Method A) or in methanol in the presence of anhydrous sodium acetate (Method B). Acid hydrolysis of compounds IIf-i and IVa-c, e was studied. Results of UV and IR spectrometric measurements and of the in vitro microbiological studies are presented. In contradistinction to corresponding thiosemicarbazides, the change in N4 nitrogen atom basicity of the parent selenosemicarbazide I (pKa of p-toluidine = 5.1), in comparison to that of 4-phenyl-selenosemicarbazide (pKa of aniline = 4.63), proved to influence the equilibrium of the reaction with omega-bromoacetophenone only in the methanol medium without addition of anhydrous sodium acetate (Method A).
