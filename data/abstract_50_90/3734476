Sixty-seven patients, 19 females and 48 males, 4-66 years old, suffering from lesions of cutaneous leishmaniasis were treated topically with an ointment comprising 15% paromomycin sulfate and 12% methylbenzethonium chloride in white soft paraffin (P-ointment, U.K. patent GB117237A). After 10 days of treatment, twice daily, the lesions in 72% of the treated patients were free of parasites, 15% became free within an additional 20 days, without further treatment, and 13% failed to respond. Pigmentation developed in 18% of the treated lesions and inflammation of varying degree was associated with the treatment. These developments did not affect the clinical healing process which was generally completed in a period of 10-30 days after termination of treatment. In addition, 94% of the treated lesions healed with little or no scarring. No adverse clinical or laboratory side effects were observed except for a burning sensation at the site of treatment. Parasites isolated from patients who failed to respond to topical treatment were found to be susceptible to PR-MBCl in both in vitro infected macrophages and in vivo in experimentally infected BALB/c mice.
