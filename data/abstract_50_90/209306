The peptide antibiotic viomycin at a concentration of 10 muM inhibits E. coli ribosomes to the extent of about 70% as measured in the poly (U) system, and to about 85% in a natural mRNA (R17) system. Ribosomes from M. smegmatis show no activity at all at this concentration of the antibiotic. Experiments on the Mg+2 dependent dissociation and association of the ribosomal subunits revealed that viomycin stabilizes the 70S couples and promotes association of ribosomal subunits. This response is related to the drug action as indicated by the observation that viomycin resistant strains are not affected by viomycin with respect to dissociation and 70S couple information. A model for the inhibitory action of the drug is proposed.
