One S. aureus plasmid coding for tetracycline resistance, pT127, and four plasmids (pC194, pC221, pC223, and pUB112) coding for chloramphenicol resistance have been introduced by transformation into B, subtilis. The plasmids replicate in--and confer antibiotic resistance upon--their new host. These experiments show that the potential for genetic exchange between diverse bacterial species is greater than has been commonly assumed.
