A cephalosporin beta-lactamase (cephalosporinase) was extracted from Enterobacter cloacae GN7471 and purified by means of column chromatography. The resulting preparation gave a single protein band upon polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The enzyme's isoelectric point was 8.4, and its molecular weight was 44,000. The optimal pH was 8.5, and the optimal temperature was 40 degrees C. The enzyme hydrolyzed cephalosporins much more readily than penicillins. The enzyme activity was inhibited by iodine, semisynthetic penicillins, cefuroxime-type cephalosporins, and cephamycin derivatives. The enzymological properties of the purified enzyme were compared with those of beta-lactamases derived from other gram-negative enteric bacteria.
