Isobutyl and trifluoro cyanoacrylates showed varying degrees of inhibition for Lactobacillus casei and Staphylococcus aureus when tested by the spread plate technique. Candida albicans and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were resistant. The results tend to support the view that inhibition of growth was due to the vapor effect and not the diffusibility of the cyanoacrylates.
