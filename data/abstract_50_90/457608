The plasmids from six clinical strains of Salmonella wien have been characterized. All the S. wien strains were found to carry three types of plasmids: an IncFI R-Tc Cm Km Ap (resistance to tetracycline, chloramphenicol, kanamycin, and ampicillin) plasmid, either conjugative or nonconjugative, of large size (90 to 100 megadaltons); an R-Ap Su Sm (resistance to ampicillin, sulfonamide, and streptomycin) plasmid of 9 megadaltons; and a very small (1.4 megadaltons) cryptic plasmid. The characteristics of conjugative R plasmids, recombinant between F'lac pro and the FI nonconjugative plasmid, indicated that regions coding for the donor phenotype were present on this plasmid. The molecular and genetic features of the R plasmids were very close to those described for the R plasmids isolated from S. wien strains of different origin. This fact supported the hypothesis of a clonal distribution of this serotype in Algeria and Europe. The analysis used to identify transposable elements showed the presence of only TnA elements, which were located on both the R-Tc Cm Km Ap and R-Ap Su Sm plasmids. They contained the structural gene for a TEM-type beta-lactamase and had translocation properties analogous to those reported for other TnA's.
