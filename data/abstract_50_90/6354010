Strictly aerobic Gram negative bacteria are found more and more often in human pathological specimens and in the environment. Amongst these bacteria, Flavobacterium poses problems of bacteriological diagnosis as their precise taxonomy is still recent. In this study, conducted on 321 strains of Flavobacterium from various sources, but essentially from patients in the intensive care unit, the authors define the methods and features of identification and the clinical significance of the species of the Flavobacterium genus. One species is particularly important in medical bacteriology, Flavobacterium meningosepticum which can cause septicaemia and neonatal meningitis which are difficult to treat.
