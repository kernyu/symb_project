Information concerning the resistance to sulfonamides in the Netherlands was obtained by determining the minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC's) of 119 strains of Bordetella bronchiseptica and 151 strains of Pasteurella multocida, obtained from pigs at five veterinary bacteriology centres, to sulfadimidine (SDM) and sulfamethoxazole (SMX). The MIC's of SDM against Su-susceptible strains were usually 4 times higher than those of SMX. About one third of B. bronchiseptica isolates were resistant (MIC greater than 64 micrograms/ml) to both sulfonamides. Approximately 7% of P. multocida isolates were resistant to SMX, and 21% to SDM. It is concluded that the use of SDM as the sulfonamide of choice for the treatment of atrophic rhinitis is questionable.
