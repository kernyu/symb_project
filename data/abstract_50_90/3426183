Ulcer microflora from 97 stomachs resected from 28 patients with gastric ulcers, 65 patients with duodenal ulcers and 4 patients with gastric and duodenal ulcers was studied. Various microorganisms were detected in 65.9 +/- 4.8 per cent of the patients with predominance of staphylococci and streptococci. At pH of the gastric juice about 4, the isolation amounted to 61.2 +/- 5.5 per cent, from 4.0 to 7.0-81.8 +/- 11.6 per cent and more than 7.0-100 +/- 4.1 per cent respectively. The levels of associations increased from 27.8 to 83.3 per cent. In patients with hypo- and achlorhydria the frequency of staphylococcus isolation from the ulcers was 2.6 times higher and that of yeast and Candida isolation was 3.7 times higher. Diphtheroids were isolated from the ulcers only of patients with normo- and hyperchlorhydria. The majority of the isolates were sensitive to gentamicin (76.7 +/- 4.6 per cent of the strains). Multiple resistance to 17-18 antibiotics was observed in enterococci.
