The product of phage P22 gene c1 has two functions: (1) it promotes synthesis of repressor and (2) during the first minutes of infection it retards expression of some lytic genes. We call the second, negative function "c1 retardation". We investigated c1 retardation in a mutant host of Salmonella typhimurium that is resistant to rifampicin and carries an altered RNA polymerase. No c1 retardation of DNA synthesis was detectable in this host after infection with wild-type phages. This elimination of the normally detectable c1 function leads to the conclusion that the mutant RNA polymerase interferes with the expression of c1 gene activity. Wild-type genes form clear plaques on the mutant host. Mutants of P22 called cly were isolated by others. These mutants form turbid plaques on the altered RNA polymerase host. Infections with P22 cly in the mutant host resulted in detectable c1 retardation. The cly mutation therefore restores c1 activity in a host which wild-type c1 is not expressed. Two spontaneous mutants were isolated from the mutant host. These two strains allowed partial expression of c1 retardation, although they remained rifampicin resistant. We interpret our data to indicate that expression of the normal functions of the gene c1 product requires an interaction of that product with the host RNA polymerase.
