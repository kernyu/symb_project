A new procedure for rapid determination of the levels of antibiotic sensitivity in pathogenic microorganisms with the use of fluorescent antibodies is described. The procedure was developed with the use of a model of the vaccinal strains of Bacillus anthracis. It is based on determination of the microbial antibiotic resistance with the method of serial dilutions on solid media. Still, the medium with an antibiotic is inoculated instead of the pathogen with the native material subject to the analysis. The antibiotic effect on the microorganism is estimated with the method of fluorescent antibodies. The replica preparations obtained as a result of the pathogen growth in a mixed culture on nutrient media containing definite concentrations of the antibiotic are examined with the method of luminescence microscopy. The modification of the immunofluorescent procedure for rapid determination of the microbial sensitivity to antibiotics does not require obligatory isolation of the pathogen as a pure culture. This makes the procedure more economic with respect to the time necessary for the analysis. The following conditions for performing rapid analysis with respect to Bacillus anthracis are required: the minimal concentration of the pathogen in the specimen (2.10(5) spores/ml), preliminary thermal treatment of the specimen for destroying the spore microflora, additional cultivation for 6-8 hours at 37 degrees C. The presence of the accompanying sporulating microflora, i.e. common microorganisms present in the atmosphere, soil and open water bodies does not prevent the performance of the analysis.
