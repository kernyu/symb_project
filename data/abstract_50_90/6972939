Izumenolide is a potent inhibitor of beta-lactamases, especially from Gram-negative bacteria. The I50 value of 0.01 microgram/ml for TEM-2 beta-lactamase, after 10 min preincubation, corresponds to a ratio of 7.6 moles inhibitor per mole of enzyme. The initial inhibitory reaction with TEM-2 beta-lactamase exhibits mixed reaction kinetics, suggesting a possible overlapping binding site with the active center. Tem-2 beta-lactamase is irreversible inactivated by izumenolide in a biphasic reaction. Carbenicillin offers partial protection against inactivation. Izumenolide exhibits limited antibiotic activity against some Gram-negative bacteria. Against beta-lactamase producing bacteria izumenolide provides protection to ampicillin and cephaloridine but the protection is limited due to permeability problems associated with izumenolide entry into the cells.
