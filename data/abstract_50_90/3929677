With a macrotube dilution method, MICs and MBCs were determined for three aminothiazolyl cephalosporins, cefpirome (HR 810), ceftazidime, and cefotaxime, against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococci, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and methicillin-resistant, -susceptible, and -tolerant strains of Staphylococcus aureus. Comparatively, cefpirome was the most active agent against all gram-positive cocci, including enterococci and methicillin-resistant S. aureus, and was as active as ceftazidime against P. aeruginosa. MBCs of cefpirome were within two dilutions of the MICs for 91% of P. aeruginosa and 90% of gram-positive cocci strains tested, except methicillin-resistant S. aureus, for which the MBCs were within three dilutions for 90% of strains.
