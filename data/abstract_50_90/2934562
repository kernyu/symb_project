The therapeutic effect of ceftizoxime suppositories (CZX-S) was studied in 8 physically handicapped patients, comprising 6 with pharyngitis, 1 with pneumonia, and 1 with urinary tract infection. The clinical effect was "excellent" in 7 and "good" in 1. Neither adverse reactions nor abnormal laboratory test findings attributable to CZX-S were detected. CZX-S proved to be useful in physically handicapped children, especially in those not suited to treatment with oral or intravenous preparations.
