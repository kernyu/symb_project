The frequency and clinical significance of Staphylococcus epidermidis isolates from blood cultures of neonates collected during a 17-month period in The New York Hospital neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) were reviewed. Twenty-three episodes of clinically significant S epidermidis bacteremia were detected using the criteria of isolation from 3/3 blood culture bottles from a single culture, or isolation from two or more blood cultures taken at different times, or simultaneous isolation from blood and fluid, pus or vascular catheter. Of these 23 episodes of S epidermidis bacteremia, ten were associated with colonized vascular catheters, and four episodes occurred in infants with necrotizing enterocolitis. Focal S epidermidis infection occurred in ten episodes, and persistent bacteremia occurred frequently in this setting. S epidermidis was the most frequent cause of bacteremia in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit during the period reviewed. Of the isolates determined to be clinically significant, 74% were resistant to methicillin and cephalothin and 91% were resistant to gentamicin. All isolates were sensitive to vancomycin. In addition to removing vascular catheters suspected of being colonized and searching for potential sites of focal infection, an antibiotic regimen that includes vancomycin should be initiated once significant S epidermidis bacteremia has been recognized in the neonate.
