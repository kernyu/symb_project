In the present work we show that sarcoma and normal hamster tissues contain a protein which agglutinates normal and transformed cells. The inhibition of agglutination by galacturonic acid and occasionally by fucose suggests a resemblance of this protein with vegetal lectins. When added 5 h after interferon, the crude semipurified and electrophoretically homogeneous preparations reduce within 20 h the antiviral state pre-established by interferon. These two biological tests have enabled us to monitor the subsequent purification steps. The isolation of the biologically active protein is greatly facilitated by its resistance to pepsin and nucleases, whereas its sensitivity to trypsin and Pronase suggests its proteinaceous character. Furthermore, the molecule is stable when heated 1-2 min at 100 degrees C in the presence or absence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. After pepsin treatment, Sephacryl G-200 gel filtration, and ion exchange chromatography on DEAE-cellulose, 25-40-fold purification can be obtained. When controlled by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, a double band (DEAE-cellulose sample) or single band (octyl-agarose sample) is detected in the 65,000-dalton region and no other contaminator is present. The eluted protein retains full biological activity when assayed by the degradation of the interferon-induced antiviral protection in the cell or titrated by cell agglutination.
