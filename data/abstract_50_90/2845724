We compared the activity of human recombinant alpha and gamma interferons (IFNs) on normal T lymphocytes and various T cell lines. IFN gamma, unlike IFN alpha, did not promote the antiviral state in these cells, or induce the activity of 2'-5' oligoadenylate synthetase. The lack of antiviral effect was observed using an RNA virus (VSV) and a DNA virus (HSV, type 1) as challenger viruses.
