A retrospective study of nosocomial infection and its aetiological agents antimicrobial sensitivity in a pediatric ICU during 65 months is reported. Using statistical analysis association was found between infection site and certain diagnostic-therapeutic procedures, such as urinary infection and urinary tract catheter, respiratory lower tract infection and respiratory assistance devices, bacteremia with intravenous catheters. Also found relationship between age and causal agents: Streptococcus faecalis is the main microorganism in newborns and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in older patients. Gram negative bacilli sensitivity increased significantly for some antimicrobial drugs: carbenicillin, cefotaxime, gentamicin, fosfomycin and tobramycin, whereas gram positive microorganisms sensitivity decreased to cephalothin, cefoxitin, trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole and gentamicin.
