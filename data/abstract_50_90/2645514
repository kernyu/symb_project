Measurement of mutant frequency in tumour specimens has been hampered by low cloning efficiency in soft agar. A method was developed to detect cell proliferation using the thymidine analogue 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrUdR). BrUdR incorporation was monitored by immunofluorescent staining of fixed cells using a monoclonal antibody highly specific for this nucleoside analogue. The 6-thioguanine (6TG) exposure conditions which inhibited DNA synthesis, as measured by BrUdR incorporation, in wild-type cells while allowing proliferation of spontaneous hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) mutants were investigated using tumour cell lines. It was shown that exposure to 10(-5) M BrUdR for the equivalent of 1 cell cycle time did not affect growth of wild-type cells, nor did it affect the growth of HPRT- mutants in the presence of 6TG. Methods for rapid flow cytometric enumeration of BrUdR-labelled 6TG-resistant cells were developed using fluorescent microspheres as an internal standard. To validate the BrUdR mutation assay, the 6TG mutant frequency (MF) was measured in L1210 R/S, a mouse leukaemic cell line (BrUdR 6TG MF = 7.0 X 10(-5] and the results directly compared with those from a microtitration cloning assay (MF = 4.6 X 10(-5]. The results were similar and within the range reported for HPRT MF in mammalian cells.
