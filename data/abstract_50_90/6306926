Preliminary results of comparative characterization of the functional activity of leukocytes by cytochemical, virologic, immunologic, and clinical methods of examinations in institutionalized young infants are summarized. The observations covered 100 infants varying in ages from 1 to 3 years with frequent and rare incidence of respiratory diseases. The diagnosis of influenza had been confirmed by serological methods: CFT and ELISA. Infants with positive serodiagnosis were selected for further studies. The functional status of leukocytes was determined by the interferon leukocyte test (ILT), alkaline phosphatase and myeloperoxidase activities. The results presented in the Tables have shown the infants frequently suffering from ARVD to have low values of ILT and higher values of alkaline phosphatase activity but low myeloperoxidase activity. More resistant infants with rare incidence of ARVD had high ILT, high myeloperoxidase activity and low alkaline activity. It is suggested that alkaline activity of leukocytes alone may be of informative value.
