The antibacterial effect of josamycin has been tested in vitro on strains of S. Aureus, Str. Pyogenes and Str. Pneumoniae isolated during 1981 from human liquor, blood and purulent secretions. It is confirmed that even modest doses of the antibiotic have this effect upon S. Aureus strains which are resistant to several antibiotics including erythromycin and lincomycin. In some cases, although bacteriostasis occurred, bacterial survival indices were fairly modest.
