Decisions regarding appropriate antibiotic therapy for treatment of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) are complicated by an incomplete understanding of the syndrome. Further, the lack of data on laparoscopic diagnosis and cure of PID severely limits our ability to interpret data on therapy outcome. Validation studies of the treatment regimens recommended by the Centers for Disease Control in the 1985 treatment guidelines for sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) suggest that both the cefoxitin/doxycycline and clindamycin/aminoglycoside combination regimens result in consistently high rates of clinical evidence of cure. The 1989 STD treatment guidelines were based on these studies and on available data regarding newer treatment regimens. Empiric, broad-spectrum therapy remains the treatment of choice. The two regimens recommended for inpatient therapy in 1989 are similar to those recommended in 1985. The recommendation for management of ambulatory patients has been substantially changed, however, because of increasing resistance of Neisseria gonorrhoeae to penicillin.
