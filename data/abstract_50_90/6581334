Clinical trials were carried out with cefotetan (CTT) in pediatric infections. Results were as follows; The mean serum concentrations of CTT following intravenous injection of 20 mg/kg were 204, 97, 56, 15, 10 micrograms/ml at 15, 60, 120, 360, 480 minutes after injection. The serum half-life was 2.18 hours. 68.3% was excreted in urine within 8 hours after injection. In vitro, the antimicrobial activity of CTT was more active than CEZ and CMZ against E. coli, H. influenzae and K. pneumoniae. CTT was administered clinically to 22 pediatric patients with various infections; 9 pneumonias, 4 bronchopneumonias, 1 acute tonsillitis and 8 urinary tract infections. Overall efficacy rate was 95%. The favorable clinical response could be gained by the doses of 30 mg/kg with being given every 12 hours. Slight elevation of S-GOT and S-GPT with mild diarrhea was observed in 2 patients and eosinophilia in 1 patient. No other serious side effect was observed.
