The in-vitro activities of several 14-, 15- and 16-membered macrolides and fluoroquinolones against Campylobacter pylori were determined. In general, 14-membered macrolides, such as clarithromycin and flurithromycin, were more active than the 15-membered macrolide, azithromycin, which was more active than 16-membered macrolides, such as miocamycin and rokitamycin. Fluoroquinolones, except ciprofloxacin and A-61827, were less active than macrolides. Clarithromycin was the most active of the new compounds against C. pylori and was as active as ampicillin. MICs of all compounds at pH 5.5 were increased when compared to MICs determined at pH 7.3. All compounds had MBCs which were the same as or within one two-fold dilution of their MICs. Frequencies of spontaneous resistance development by C. pylori NCTC 11637 at four and eight times the MIC of the compounds were low and ranged from less than 1 x 10(-9) to 1 x 10(-7).
