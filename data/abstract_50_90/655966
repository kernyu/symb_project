The anthelmintic efficacy of 6 non-benzimidazole compounds and thiabendazole against standardised, benzimidazole resistant strains of H. contortus and T. colubriformis in sheep was determined using a controlled test. All compounds were administered intraruminally at their recommended therapeutic dose rates and 4 of the compounds were also assessed at half their recommended therapeutic dose rates. Levimisole at a dose of 6.4 mg/kg body weight, morantel at 4.4 mg/kg and 8.8 mg/kg, naphthalophos at 6.25 mg/kg and 12.5 mg/kg, rafoxanide at 7.5 mg/kg and phenothiazine at 530 mg/kg were 98% or more effective in removing adult infections of benzimidazole resistant H. contortus. Rafoxanide at 3.75 mg/kg, phenothiazine at 265 mg/kg and carbon tetrachloride at 0.05ml/kg were less effective, removing 80%, 73% and 72% respectively of the benzimidazole resistant H. contortus worm burdens. Against the benzimidazole resistant T. colubriformis levamisole at 6.4 mg/kg, and morantel at 4.4 mg/kg and 8.8 mg/kg removed 99%, 68% and 86% respectively of the adult infections. All other anthelmintics had little or no efficacy at the dose rates tested. Thiabendazole at 44 mg/kg had no significant effect against these strains of H. contortus and T. colubriformis. Several non-benzimidazole anthelmintics have shown high efficacy in this experiment and should be suitable for treating infections with benzimidazole resistant H. contortus. Of the anthelmintics tested, only levamisole and morantel show high efficacy against benzimidazole resistant T. colubriformis.
