Two hundred and sixty strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were isolated from patients of the Asaf Harofe Government Hospital. The strains were typed by phage technique and 64 of them were also typed according to pyocine sensitivity. The two methods proved complementary, and reduced the number of untypable strains. Phage typing was performed with both routine test dilution (RTD) and more concentrated phage suspensions. The most reliable results were obtained at 100 RTD.
