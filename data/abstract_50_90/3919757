A case of pseudomonas endophthalmitis after penetrating keratoplasty is described. Bacterial sensitivities in this case and in five of six previously reported cases of endophthalmitis after corneal transplant showed resistance to gentamicin, an antibiotic routinely used in the transport medium. The recovery of antibiotic resistant bacteria in antibiotic supplemented media is discussed with emphasis on prevention.
