The plasmid-mediated formaldehyde resistance of Serratia marcescens and Escherichia coli was examined. For that purpose the outer membranes of isogenic strains (with and without resistance plasmid) were compared. No quantitative or immunological differences in lipopolysaccharide of resistant and sensitive strains were noted. By contrast analysis of outer membrane proteins revealed that the sensitive variants had a higher protein content than the resistant strains. When outer membrane proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE the number of bands seemed identical for sensitive and resistant strains but the intensity of some of the bands was greater for the sensitive isolates. In addition, the surface hydrophobicity was greater for the resistance than for the sensitive strains. These findings suggest that the formaldehyde resistance plasmid of Serratia marcescens confer changes in cell surface proteins and surface hydrophobicity.
