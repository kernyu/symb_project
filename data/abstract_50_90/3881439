Interferon-alpha + beta (IFN-alpha + beta) plays a central role in the specific resistance to influenza virus infection of those mice carrying the gene Mx (for review, see Haller, O. (1981) Curr. Topics Microbiol. Immun. 92, 25). Particularly, mouse IFN-alpha + beta induces a unique protein in cultivated Mx-bearing cells which is associated with a highly efficient and specific antiviral resistance to influenza viruses (Horisberger, M. A., Staeheli, P., and Haller, O. (1983) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 80, 1910). In this report, a procedure is described for the induction of this protein in several organs of Mx-bearing mice and a method for its purification from liver tissue. The protein Mx is nucleophilic and has a Mr approaching 78,000. It is not concentrated in nucleoli and it is not tightly bound to chromatin or nuclear matrices. Polyclonal antibodies to the protein Mx were raised in BALB/c mice. They recognized the protein Mx immobilized on nitrocellulose in a dot immunoassay and they immunoprecipitated the IFN-induced protein Mx from cultivated Mx-bearing cells labeled with a radioactive tracer.
