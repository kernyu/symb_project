Sensitivity of 125 strains of group B streptococci isolated from newborns, their mothers and personnel in a maternity home was studied with respect to 12 antibiotics: benzylpenicillin, ampicillin, methicillin, cephalotin, erythromycin, lincomycin, levomycetin (chloramphenicol), oxacillin, tetracycline, streptomycin, gentamicin and ristomycin. The method of serial dilutions in a solid medium was applied. All the strains were sensitive to ristomycin and erythromycin. The predominating number of the strains were sensitive to lincomycin, levomycetin and the beta-lactam antibiotics. Strains resistant or moderately resistant to benzylpenicillin, ampicillin, oxacillin, methicillin and cephalotin were detected. The majority of the strains were resistant to streptomycin, tetracycline and gentamicin. Multiple antibiotic resistance with 2-7 determinants was revealed in 11.2 per cent of the strains. The antibiotic sensitivity of the strains isolated from the newborns, their mothers and the personnel in the maternity home was on the whole similar or insignificantly differed.
