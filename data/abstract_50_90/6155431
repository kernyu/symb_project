In transformed mouse embryo cells, type II interferon had much less antiviral activity than type I interferon. In non-transformed cells, the two interferons had similar high activity, Reversal of the phenotype of Moloney sarcoma virus (MSV) transformed cells by sodium butyrate restored their sensitivity to the antiviral action of type II interferon. Additional evidence for a role of the cytoskeletal network in the action of type II interferon is that its antiviral effect is reduced by cytochalasin B, colchicine or vinblastine. MSV-transformed cells, selected for their resistance to the antiviral action of type I interferon, were sensitive to type II interferon. These differences in the effects of type I and II interferon on transformed cells are at present unexplained, but suggest that they have at least partially separate mechanisms of action.
