The authors have evaluated the susceptibility of azlocillin to beta-lactamases habitually produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, i.e. TEM and CARB types penicillinases and the so-called Sabath and Abraham cephalosporinase. As all penicillins, azlocillin is liable to hydrolysis by penicillinases that also affect, through to a lesser extent, some cephalosporin. It is also degraded, albeit moderately by the Sabath and Abraham cephalosporinase. The authors have also compared the behaviour of azlocillin towards beta-lactamases to that of other beta-lactam antibiotics, notably carbenicillin, cefoperazone and cefsulodin.
