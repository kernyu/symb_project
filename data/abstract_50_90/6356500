The in vitro sensitivity of Plasmodium falciparum to chloroquine was studied in parasites from 45 children on the island of Flores, Indonesia. The micro in vitro culture technique and a 12-volt battery-operated field incubator were found to be well suited to the field situation encountered. Parasites from seven children (15.6%) were resistant to chloroquine in vitro: two at 8 pico-moles of chloroquine, two at 16 pico-moles, and three at 32 pico-moles. This is the first report of chloroquine resistant from Flores.
