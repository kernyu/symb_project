Results of studies in vitro of the susceptibility of 102 strains of Candida type (88--Candida albicans, 7--Candida intermedia, 3--Candida parapsilosis, 1--Candida stellatoidea, 3--Torulopsis candida), to itraconazole have been reported. The strains were isolated from lesions of the skin and mucous membranes. The strains tested showed no resistance to this drug. Itraconazole concentrations inhibiting completely the growth of the yeast-like fungi ranged from 0.02 to 35.0 micrograms/ml of a culture medium. Strains of Candida albicans have shown the least susceptibility, most Candida intermedia. Changes in sensitivity (MIC) of some strains of Candida type for itraconazole after 48 and 72-hrs periods of incubation were very little.
