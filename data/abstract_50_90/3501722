Comparative in vitro Studies of the beta-Lactamase Inhibitory Effects of Clavulanic Acid and Sulbactam on Ampicillin-resistant Enterobacteria. Clavulanic acid and sulbactam alone are infective against Pseudomonas and enterococci. Staphylococci and enterobacteriaceae are inhibited by high concentrations not attainable under clinical conditions. Strains of Acinetobacter, especially A. lwoffii are susceptible to clavulanic acid and highly susceptible to sulbactam. The sulbactam-ampicillin combination is superior to clavulanic acid-ampicillin against C. freundii, Enterobacter spp. and M. morganii. The latter combination is superior against Klebsiella spp. and E. coli. Antagonistic effects are more frequent with the clavulanic acid combination (Enterobacter spp. and C. freundii) but are rarely observed with the sulbactam combination (Providencia spp. and P. rettgeri).
