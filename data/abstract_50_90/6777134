A case is reported of fetal survival after maternal listeremia. Transplacental fetal infection may have been prevented by early delivery. Review of the literature suggests that management be based on cultures of the maternal and fetal compartments. We believe that the considerations for immediate delivery as opposed to medical therapy should rest on the fetal maturity and the sensitivity of the organism to antibiotics which will reach therapeutic levels in the fetal compartment.
