Plasmid pKC7, a derivative of pBR322, specifies resistance to both ampicillin and kanamycin. The DNA of this small plasmid (5.8 kb) contains unique sites for insertion of DNA cleaved with ten different restriction endonucleases. A detailed restriction endonuclease cleavage map is presented. The utility of this plasmid for cloning is discussed.
