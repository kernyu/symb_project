Investigation was made on the therapeutic effect of a new antibiotic, cefatrizine(CFT), in oral infections according to the following procedure. Results are summarized as follows. Determination was made on the MIC of CFT against 8 clinical isolates of S. epidermidis, 5 of S. aureus and 7 of E. coli in comparison with those of CEX and PBPC. MICs of CFT against S aures were demonstrated 3.13 to 6.25 mcg/ml which were superior to those of CEX and ABPC. CFT was administered orally in a dose of 500 mg at an hour and a half before the extraction of the impacted wisdom tooth in the mandibula. During the operation, gingival and blood specimens were collected and each CFT level was determined. The mean CFT level in the gingiva reached to 0.95 mcg/ml and that in the blood to 5.77 mcg/ml. According to these experimental results, CFT was administered to patients with moderate oral infection at a dose of 500 mg and clinical assessment was made according to the criteria established by Japanese Society of Oral Surgeons. As the results, the effectiveness rate of CFT was 85%. No serious side effect was observed. From the results of the present study, CFT may be effective for moderate oral surgery infections.
