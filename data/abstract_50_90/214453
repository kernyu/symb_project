SV40-transformed hamster cells were selected for resistance to ethidium bromide (EB). Several cell lines were established, which grew in the presence of up to 250 microgram/ml EB. The EB resistance is genetically stable. The cloned resistant cells show no difference in morphology, with the exception of the mitochondrial ultrastructure, which exhibits condensed cristae formation. The tumorigenicity of these cells in Syrian gold hamsters is considerably reduced. Incorporation of radioactive labelled thymidine into mitochondrial DNA is not influenced by the presence of the drug. Gel electrophoresis with mitochondrial proteins from wild-type and resistant cells reveals significantly different patterns. The mechanism of EB resistance is discussed.
