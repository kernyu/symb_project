Denture stomatitis (chronic atrophic candidosis) is a very common complication to the wearing of complete dentures. The infection is due to a contamination of the denture by yeasts. In a number of studies the clinical effect of Hibitane when used as a denture disinfectant has been studied. It was found that Hibitane (0.2--2%) caused a significant amelioration of inflamed palatal tissues and a reduction in the number of yeast cells harbored on the palatal mucosa and the fitting surface of the dentures. However, relapse of the infection was frequent after treatment was sustained. It was concluded that Hibitane could not be recommended for routine denture disinfection, first, because it caused staining of the dentures, second, because of the relative resistance of the yeast to the action of the drug. However, it seems justified to use Hibitane prophylactically as a denture disinfectant in patients who are highly susceptible to developing disseminating or systemic candidosis. Hibitane is a valuable drug in the treatment of denture stomatitis when used as a denture disinfectant.
