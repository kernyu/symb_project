This study was undertaken to determine the level of resistance against pyrantel citrate in strains of Oesophagostomum quadrispinulatum and Oesophagostomum dentatum which have previously been found resistant to this anthelmintic. Groups of pigs were artificially infected with batches of infective larvae which were previously found either susceptible or resistant to pyrantel citrate. After treatment with 1, 2 and 4 times the recommended dose (14 mg kg-1) of pyrantel citrate, the resistant O. quadrispinulatum population was reduced by 51.0, 76.2 and 86.1%, and O. dentatum by 41.2, 47.9 and 78.5%. The results indicated that O. dentatum was slightly more resistant (P less than 0.05) than O. quadrispinulatum to pyrantel citrate. Treatment of the susceptible worms with 1 and 2 times the recommended dose caused a reduction in worm numbers by 61.0 and 99.4%, respectively.
