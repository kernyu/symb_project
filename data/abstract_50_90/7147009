Forty samples of Malaysian cooked foods were examined for the presence of antibiotic-resistant coliforms and R plasmids. Twenty seven (68%) of the foods had antibiotic-resistant coliforms and 5 (13%) had R plasmids. Nineteen samples (48%) had total bacterial counts over 10(6) per gm and in 5 samples, no coliforms were detected. Our findings show that cooked food may be one possible way by which R plasmids are spread. The control of the spread of R plasmids is discussed.
