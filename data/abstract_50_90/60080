Data on the experimental and clinical study of capreomycin in the treatment of tuberculosis are presented. It was shown that capreomycin had low activity with respect to the sensitive strain of Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37 Rv in vitro and the respective infection caused by it in mice. The activity of capreomycin in vitro with respect to streptomycin resistant strains was the same as that with respect to the sensitive strains, while in vivo it increased 3 times. Capreomycin showed a tendency to decreasing its activity with respect to strains highely resistant to canamycin only in vitro. The effect of capreomycin on tuberculosis infection caused by strains resistant to different concentrations of canamycin was the same as that on tuberculosis infection caused by sensitive strains. Cross resistance between florimycin (viomycin) and capreomycin was shown. Clinical trails of capreomycin revealed its moderate therapeutic efficiency, relatively low toxicity and an allergenizing effect on the host. Transient ventibulopatia without pronounced signs of ototoxic action was observed. The nephrotoxic effect was moderate and transient. It was observed predominantly at the peak of the allergic reactions to the antitubercle drugs. The data obtained during the study allow recommendation of capreomycin use in clinics as reserve drug when the causative agent is not resistant to florimycin. The drug should be used under regular control of the blood picture, electrolyte metabolism, state of the kidneys, auditory and vestibular apparatus.
