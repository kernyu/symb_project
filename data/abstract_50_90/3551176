The chloroquine-resistant strains P. falciparum are widely spread in the countries of South-East Asia, Latin America. Since the middle of the 70s the strains also occurred in Eastern Africa. The given paper is concerned with 4 patients suffering from imported chloroquine-resistant tropical malaria. Of these, 3 patients come from Africa, and one from Vietnam. In the latter patient, the disease ran a grave course and was attended by coma, acute renal insufficiency, hepatitis, and hemolytic anemia. The patient was registered as having grade III resistance of P. falciparum to chloroquine. The schedules of the disease treatment including quinine with fansidar, metakelphin (or with sulphalene and chloridine), mafloquine or tetracycline are presented.
