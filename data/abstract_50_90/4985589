Class II ampicillin-resistant mutants of Escherichia coli are defined as having a twofold increase in penicillinase-mediated ampicillin resistance when determined by colony formation tests on plates. In this paper, one class II mutant has been compared to its parent strain. In liquid medium, the mutant was less resistant than the parent strain both in the absence and in the presence of R1 and R-factor mediating penicillinase activity. The penicillinase activity was found to be almost completely bound to the cells in the parent strain, whereas it was excreted to a great extent in the class II mutant strain. In liquid medium, resistance was well correlated to the cell-bound penicillinase activity, whereas the excreted penicillinases were also of great importance for survival on ampicillin plates. The mutant also had a changed resistance to a great number of other antibacterial drugs. The mutant was found to be more sensitive than the parent strain to osmotic shock, especially when treated with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid or washed with sodium ions. However, the osmotic stability was restored by the presence of 1 mm Mg(2+) ions. The class II mutant was more sensitive than the parent strain to sodium cholate, and it adsorbed the phages T4 and T3-1 at a slower rate than did the parent strain. The two strains adsorbed T6 at the same rate. The class II phenotype could be gradually reversed by increasing concentrations of divalent cations. The pleiotropic changes in the phenotype are apparently unrelated to the specific targets for the antibacterial agents tested. They are secondary consequences of a cell envelope mutation. The findings indicate that the class II mutation mediates a structural change in the lipopolysaccharide of the cell envelope.
