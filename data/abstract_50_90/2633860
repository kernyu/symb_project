The use of Mefloquine in the prophylactic treatment of malaria has, up to now, been hampered by the standpoint adopted by the WHO, the Conseil Superieur d'Hygiene and some specialists, for whom Mefloquine should be administered only for short stays in areas of strong chloroquine-resistance. This policy, which prevents many travellers and overseas residents from benefitting from one of the most effective prophylactic treatments on the market today, thereby indirectly causing a number of pernicious cases of malaria, is based on the unfounded, unproved premise that wide use of this drug would foster the development of mefloquine-resistance or on side-effects, which are in fact rarely of any consequence and always curable. The efficacity of this drug should ensure that it is used for the basic prophylactic treatment of malaria in chloroquine-resistant areas, whatever the degree of this resistance and the length of stay involved, on condition that care is taken as to the tolerance of this drug in the early stages of treatment.
