Escherichia coli strains isolated from 151 swine and 108 fowl, which were kept at the Animal Health Center, Maebashi, Japan, were surveyed for drug resistance and distribution of R factors. All of the swine and 38% of the fowl excreted E. coli strains resistant to tetracycline, chloramphenicol, streptomycin, and sulfanilamide, or certain combinations thereof. Among 278 resistant cultures isolated from swine, 13% were found to be resistant to one antibiotic, whereas 87% were resistant to more than one antibiotic. Among these resistant strains, 40% carried R factors which were transferable by the usual conjugal process. The resistance patterns of these R factors included 36% which were singly resistant and 64% which were multiply resistant. Among 54 resistant cultures isolated from fowl, 24% were singly resistant and 76% were multiply resistant. Of the resistant strains from fowl, 22% carried R factors. The resistance patterns of R factors included 50% of the singly resistant type and 50% which were multiply resistant. In spite of feeding with dairy products containing only tetracycline, a high incidence of multiple resistance was observed in the E. coli strains and the R factors isolated from these animals.
