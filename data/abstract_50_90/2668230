Chancroid, an ulcerous disease of the genitalia caused by Haemophilus ducreyi, occurs rarely but regularly in Germany. Exact diagnosis is based on the clinical features and a direct smear, and in particular on cultivation of the organism, showing its unique macromorphological characteristics. The sensitivity of cultivation has increased due to the development of selective media for primary isolation. Resistance problems during the last decade meant that a change to new therapeutic strategies was unavoidable. The work presented here includes a case report and a review of the recent literature, it illustrates modern methods of diagnosis and treatment of Haemophilus ducreyi infections 100 years after the first description of the organism.
