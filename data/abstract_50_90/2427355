The extent of parasite proliferation following completion of the first cycle of intracellular replication was significantly higher in CD-1 nu/nu mice and in irradiated mice compared to other, including highly susceptible, mouse strains. A control of parasite proliferation thus occurs in normal mice as early as the first cycle of intracellular replication. The thymus dependency and radiation sensitivity of the early control of proliferation of Trypanosoma cruzi suggest that an immune response to the parasite is involved in the early control of proliferation. The BXH-2 recombinant inbred strain demonstrated an inability to control early proliferation and, 4-5 days after infection, had parasitemias several times higher than those observed in susceptible mouse strains. The BXH-2 strain appears to lack the early control mechanism. When the extent of proliferation of T. cruzi at completion of the first cycle of intracellular replication was compared in inbred strains of mice having varying levels of resistance to the parasite, the extent of proliferation correlated with host resistance, being lowest in the most resistant strains (C57BL/6, SJL) and highest in the most susceptible strains (C3H, A). It is suggested that the mechanism(s) controlling early parasite proliferation may be of primary importance as the basis for host resistance.
