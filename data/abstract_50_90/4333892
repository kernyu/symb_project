(S,S)-1,2-bis(5-methoxy-2-benzimidazolyl)-1,2-ethanediol showed antiviral activity in monolayer tissue culture systems against 55 strains of rhinovirus, three types of poliovirus, and strains of type A and B coxsackieviruses. Neither the compound nor any of the analogues tested showed virucidal activity. Its antiviral activity was not associated with interference with viral attachment to or penetration into the cell. At a concentration of 0.1 mg/ml, this group of compounds was generally nontoxic to WI-38, primary bovine kidney, and African green monkey kidney cells and had antiviral activity with 100% inhibition of virus-induced cytopathic effects (CPE). At antiviral levels, these compounds prevented CPE of up to 10(6) median tissue culture infective dose units of virus and completely inhibited formation of new infective virions. The compounds showed antiviral activity both prophylactically and therapeutically against rhinoviruses. Infected cultures could be cleared of CPE up to 90 hr after infection.
