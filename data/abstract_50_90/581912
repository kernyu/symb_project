A method of using commercially available benzimidazole anthelmintics in an egg hatch test, to record levels of resistance is described. The test shows that a side-resistance is present to all the benzimidazole anthelmintics tested against both Haemonchus contortus and Trichostrongylus colubriformis after selection with thiabendazole. Additional selection on the field resistant strain of H contortus with thiabendazole showed increased levels of resistance to all the compounds tested while similar selection of T colubriformis failed to change the level of resistance after 20 generations. The level of resistance recorded by the egg hatch test in vitro is greater than that recorded for adults in vivo for the CF strain of H contortus and T colubriformis. Problems associated with reading the test are mentioned as are the different levels for the threshold of activity.
