It is an acceptable medical practice to use second-line antimycobacterial drugs in combination with isoniazid in treatment of isoniazid-resistant tuberculosis. Recent investigations have demonstrated the importance of determining chemotherapeutic interaction in instances of multiple antibiotic use. We studied the inhibitory effect of combinations of isoniazid with ethambutol, rifampin, ethionamide, cycloserine, viomycin, and kanamycin against three isoniazid-resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and three strains of M. fortuitum. The isobologram technique with drug concentrations of 0.4 to 100 mug/ml was used. With the exception of single instances in which kanamycin plus isoniazid (M. tuberculosis strain 9999) and ethionamide plus isoniazid (M. fortuitum strain 2080) seemed to have a synergistic effect, neither synergy nor antagonism was noted for any of the combinations. These studies show that the combined use of isoniazid and a second line antimycobacterial agent results in vitro in indifferent inhibitory activity.
