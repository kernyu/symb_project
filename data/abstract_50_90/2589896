Three hundred and ninety two strains of S. aureus isolated from bacteria carriers and patients with staphylococcal infections in different regions of the Soviet Union were investigated. 55.9 per cent of the isolates were able to produce exotoxin of toxic shock. No regular relation between resistance to definite antibiotics (tetracycline, chloramphenicol, benzylpenicillin, streptomycin, lincomycin, erythromycin, oleandomycin, gentamicin and methicillin) and the polyresistance range on the one hand and the ability to produce toxic shock exotoxin on the other hand was revealed.
