Kinetics of transport of the acridine derivative 4'-(9-acridinylamino)-methanesulfon-m-anisidide (m-AMSA) were examined in P388 murine leukemia cells and in P388/ADR, a subline selected for adriamycin resistance and cross-resistant to a variety of drugs including m-AMSA. Compared with the drug-responsive parent cell line, P388/ADR cells showed impaired accumulation of m-AMSA and an enhanced rate of drug exodus. Competition studies demonstrated structural specificity of the outward transport process. There was a low degree of intracellular m-AMSA binding, and steady-state drug levels were reached in less than 1 min. These results suggest that m-AMSA will be a useful probe for studying transport systems associated with anthracycline resistance.
