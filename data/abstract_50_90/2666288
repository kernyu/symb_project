Multidrug-resistant (MDR) clinical isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae were checked for their sensitivity toward silver nitrate by the tube-dilution method. Nearly 75% of MDR strains could be successfully inhibited by 5 mg/L of silver nitrate. A significant correlation was observed between incidence of silver and trimoxazole resistance and silver and kanamycin resistance in these isolates. The genetic linkage of these two properties could not be proved since simultaneous curing and co-transfer studies gave negative results.
