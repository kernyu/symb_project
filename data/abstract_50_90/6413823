The transmissible plasmid pAM beta 1, which codes for resistance to erythromycin and lincomycin, was transferred from Streptococcus faecalis to several strains of Bacillus thuringiensis by a filter-mating process. Introduction of pAM beta 1 into the Emr transconjugant strains of B. thuringiensis was confirmed by Southern hybridisation using the 32P-labelled pAM beta 1 as a probe. In the B. thuringiensis transconjugant strains, used as donors, the beta plasmid conserved its ability to be transferred during intraspecific mating, with a frequency of 10(-4) per recipient cell. In addition, the transconjugant clones acted as donors of the erythromycin resistance marker and permitted the transfer of cryptic plasmids present in the B. thuringiensis (beta) strains used as donors. From a transconjugant clone of B. thuringiensis a hybrid plasmid resulting from an in vivo insertion into pAM beta 1 of a 3 Md DNA sequence was isolated. This 3 Md DNA molecule originated from a 54 Md plasmid of a kurstaki strain and is related to several plasmids found in different serotypes of B. thuringiensis.
