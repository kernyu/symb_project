BACKGROUND AND METHODS: The healthy members of a community represent its largest reservoir of bacteria resistant to antimicrobial agents. We compared the resistance to eight agents of Escherichia coli in stool samples from untreated, healthy children in cities on three continents. RESULTS: When screened by a selective method that detected 1 resistant colony in 10,000 colonies, nearly half the children in Boston (18 of 39) had no resistant colonies--a finding consistent with the findings of other surveys performed in developed countries. However, all but 1 of 41 children screened in Caracas, Venezuela, and all but 2 of 53 in Qin Pu, China, carried resistant strains. Only 1 child in Boston but 25 in Caracas and 34 in Qin Pu carried strains resistant to trimethoprim. None of the children in Boston or Caracas but 17 in Qin Pu carried strains resistant to gentamicin. Among 10 colonies selected randomly from each stool sample, the average frequency of resistance in Caracas was 3.6 times greater than in Boston, and that in Qin Pu was 5.3 times greater. There was resistance to five or more antimicrobial agents in 20 percent of the Qin Pu strains and in 6 percent of the Caracas strains but in none of the Boston strains. CONCLUSIONS: In addition to clinical isolates, as reported previously, the bacteria that colonize health children in the community may be resistant far more often in some regions than in others. A low rate of carriage of antimicrobial resistance in the community should become a public health goal.
