Sensitivity of vibrios and aeromonads to vibriostatic O129 (2,4-diamino-6,7-diisopropyl pteridine) was studied. The vibrios and aeromonads were isolated in the USSR. The tests were performed with disks made in the USSR and Great Britain. The content of the drug in the disks was 10 and 150 micrograms. It was shown that V. cholerae O1 V. cholerae not O1 and V. albensis were highly sensitive to vibriostatic O129 and produced no growth in the presence of either low or high concentrations of the drug. Halophilic vibrios and 26.3 per cent of the aeromonads resistant to low concentrations of the drug were less sensitive to the vibriostatic. The aeromonads and plesiomonads were resistant to the drug. The reaction to vibriostatic O129 was found to be one of the biological features of vibrios and aeromonads which can be used for differentiation of genera Vibrio and Aeromonas and within genus Vibrio as a taxonomic criterion.
