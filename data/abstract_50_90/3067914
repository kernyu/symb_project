Oral antibiotics that may be useful in dermatology can be classified as beta-lactams (penicillins and cephalosporins), tetracyclines, macrolides, or quinolones; other options are clindamycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, rifampin, and metronidazole. Proper understanding of the mechanisms of action and resistance, pharmacology, antimicrobial spectra, and adverse effects of these drugs will enable the clinician to obtain the best results.
