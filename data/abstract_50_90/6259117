Streptococcus faecalis BM4100 was resistant to high levels of gentamicin, kanamycin, and structurally related antibiotics. The genes conferring resistance to aminocyclitols in this strain were carried by a plasmid, pIP800, self-transferable to other S. faecalis strains. The aminocyclitol resistance was mediated by constitutively synthesized phosphotransferase and acetyltransferase activities. It was inferred that phosphorylation occurred at the 2"-hydroxyl group and that acetylation occurred at the 6'-hydroxyl group of the aminocyclitols. The enzyme activities were not separable by gel filtration or by isoelectric focusing. Their apparent molecular weight was 31,000, and their isoelectric point was 5.3. With respect to substrate profile, size, and charge, the transferases from strain BM4100 resembled closely those with identical site specificity described in staphylococci. These results suggest that plasmid gene transfer may occur between the two pathogenic bacterial genera.
