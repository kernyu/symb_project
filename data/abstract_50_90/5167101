Staphylococcus epidermidis BV is a group of mannitol-fermenting coagulase-negative staphylococci characterized by multiple antibiotic resistance, very similar biochemical characteristics, and phage susceptibility. Clinical isolates belonging to this group are resistant to most antibiotics tested, including oxacillin, lincomycin, and novobiocin. The only antibiotic to which all tested strains are sensitive is vancomycin. Common biochemical traits of the tested S. epidermidis BV strains include fermentation of trehalose and ribose, phospho-beta-glucosidase activity, growth on synthetic medium with amino acids as carbon source, and lack of deoxyribonuclease, phosphatase, lipase, and gelatinase activity. Some of these characteristics appear more frequently in mannitol-positive control strains than in mannitol-negative strains. S. epidermidis BV strains carry lysogenic phages with a host range restricted to this group. These phages allow the differentiation of individual strains.
