Sixty-three strains of E. coli transconjugants derived from E. coli K12 J62-1 containing plasmids derived from Klebsiella pneumoniae, were examined for the presence of phenotypic markers other than antibiotic resistance. This investigation was carried out using API 50CHE and API ZYM tests. Beta-glucosidase was found in 63/63 J62-1 transconjugants. Dulcitol dehydrogenase was present in 92.1% while beta-galactosidase was present in 70% of transconjugants. None of the three enzymes were present in the recipient. Dulcitol dehydrogenase was present only in the transconjugants and is absent from the donors and recipient. The transconjugants, cured of their antibiotic resistant plasmids retained dulcitol dehydrogenase activity. The Klebsiella donors were not cured of antibiotic resistance by the curing process.
