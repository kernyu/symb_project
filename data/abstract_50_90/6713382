Compared to an untransformed rat cell line, 3Y1, adenovirus 12-transformed cell lines of 3Y1 were highly sensitive to the cytotoxic action of an imidazole antibiotic, clotrimazole. In contrast, SV40-transformed rat cell lines derived from the 3Y1 cell line showed no appreciable difference in the response to clotrimazole when compared to 3Y1 cells. Clotrimazole-resistant clones, WCT-1 and WCT-2, which were spontaneously isolated from the adenovirus 12-transformed cell line W5, showed 5- to 10-fold higher resistance than did W5; the dose-response curves of clotrimazole-resistant clones were similar to those of the untransformed 3Y1 cells. The growth of 3Y1 cells was blocked in the presence of 1% serum, whereas those of W5, WCT-1, and WCT-2 cells were only slightly affected by the same dose of serum in the medium. The membrane fractions of 3Y1, W5, and WCT-1 cells were found to contain similar cholesterol:phospholipid ratios. The phospholipid composition in the membrane fraction of line WCT-1 was similar to that of line W5 but not to that of line 3Y1. By contrast, the fatty acid composition was specifically altered in clotrimazole-resistant clones; cellular contents and some species of fatty acid such as 16:1, 18:2, and 20:4 in WCT-1 and WCT-2 cells were similar to those of 3Y1 but not to those of W5 cells. Differential sensitivities of various cell lines to clotrimazole are discussed in relation to the lipid composition.
