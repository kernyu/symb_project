Antimicrobial sensitivity patterns were determined for 53 isolates of Haemophilus pleuropneumoniae from pneumonic porcine lung tissue. All strains were sensitive to chloramphenicol, gentamicin, spectinomycin, and sulfachlorpyridazine. Other antimicrobials tested had less efficacy for in vitro inhibition of H pleuropneumoniae.
