Recombinant murine gamma-interferon (IFN) was tested for its ability to enhance murine polymorphonuclear neutrophil (PMN) fungicidal activity in vitro. PMNs, elicited by intraperitoneal injection of thioglycollate 4 hr prior to collection, were treated with 0.00003-300,000 units of IFN per milliliter for 1 hr prior to challenge with yeast form Blastomyces dermatitidis. These PMNs were not fungicidal for Blastomyces in the absence of IFN; significant enhancement of PMN fungicidal activity by IFN treatment occurred in a dose-dependent manner with maximal enhancement observed at 30,000 U/ml (21% killing). Pretreatment of IFN with rabbit anti-IFN antiserum before addition to PMNs eliminated the enhancement of fungicidal activity by effective doses of IFN. PMN fungicidal activity against phagocytizable Candida albicans was significantly (P less than .001) higher (71.3 +/- 17.4%) than against B. dermatitidis. Candidacidal activity was not significantly enhanced by IFN treatment of PMNs. Exogenously added lipopolysaccharide, at levels corresponding to those found in this preparation of IFN, did not activate PMNs for enhanced fungicidal capacity. These data indicate a stimulatory role for IFN in the killing of B. dermatitidis by PMNs, suggesting that IFN is an active component of the communication between T lymphocytes and PMNs with respect to antimicrobial resistance. They suggest a natural role for IFN in host defense against blastomycosis and other fungal infections, and a possible therapeutic use for exogenous IFN in fungal disease.
