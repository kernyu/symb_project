Four strains of Staphylococcus epidermidis from clinical sources were capable of serving as donors for the transduction of either penicillinase production, ethidium bromide resistance, or tetracycline resistance. Three typing phages served as transducing phages and, depending upon the combination of transducing phage, donor strain, and recipient strain, the rates of transduction ranged between 10(-5) and 10(-9). In one strain, cotransduction of penicillinase production and ethidium bromide resistance was observed. Although ultraviolet irradiation kinetics indicated that both the tetracycline resistance and the penicillin resistance determinants were located on plasmids, only resistance to tetracycline could be eliminated by growth in the presence of curing agents or at elevated temperature. However, evidence was obtained by agarose gel electrophoretic studies that both the tetracycline resistance and the penicillin resistance determinants are located on separate plasmids in this organism.
