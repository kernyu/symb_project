1. Reversible effects of brief periods of anoxia (replacing 95% O2-5% CO2 with 95% N2-5% CO2 for 2-4 min) were studied in CA1 neurons in hippocampal slices (from Sprague-Dawley rats), kept in an interface-type chamber at 33.5 degree. 2. The predominant voltage change during anoxia (N2) was a hyperpolarization, accompanied by a marked fall in resistance and excitability; synaptic potentials were also depressed, especially inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs). 3. In voltage-current (V-I) plots, the N2-evoked hypolarization had a reversal potential below -90mV, even when recording with 2 M KCl electrodes and after substituting 90% of medium Cl- with isethionate. The accompanying fall in input resistance (RN) is therefore probably caused by an increase in K conductance (in agreement with previous reports). There was evidence that anomalous rectification enhances the fall in RN but limits the hyperpolarization. 4. These effects of anoxia were not fully blocked by any of the K-channel antagonists tested, including Cs, TEA, 4-AP, quinine and apamin. 5. Intracellular injections of Ca chelators caused a variable depression of N2-evoked reductions in RN. 6. It is unlikely that N2 activates ATP-sensitive K channels as tolbutamide enhanced rather than depressed the hyperpolarization and fall in RN. 7. When early depletion of cellular ATP was prevented by incubation in creatine (25 mM for greater than 1 h), even longer anoxic periods produced only minor changes in potential, RN, and synaptic transmission. 8. It was concluded that activation of K conductance by a rise in cytosolic-free Ca2+ is the most plausible of several possible underlying mechanisms.
