Cell lines from Chinese hamster ovary [CHO-K1-D3] and human fibroblast cells [46, XX, 18p-] were mutagenized with N-nitrosomethylurea followed by a selection for cycloheximide resistance. Two mutants resistant against the drug were selected from either wildtype. 80S ribosomes and their ribosomal subunits were isolated from all mutant and wildtype cells. 80S ribosomes reassociated from the isolated subunits were as active as isolated 80S couples in the poly (U) dependent poly (Phe) synthesis. Hybrid 80S ribosomes constructed from subunits of the various cell lines of the same species were fully active, whereas the interspecies 80S hybrids were not active at all in poly (Phe) synthesis. Hybrid 80S ribosomes from subunits of mutant and the corresponding wildtype cells were tested in the poly (U) assay in the presence and absence of cycloheximide. The results strikingly indicate that in all four mutant cell lines the resistance against cycloheximide is conferred by the large subunit of cytoplasmic ribosomes.
