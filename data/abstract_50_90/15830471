trans-5-amino-3-[2-(5-nitro-2-furyl)vinyl]-Delta(2) -1,2,4-oxadiazole, a new antimicrobial nitrofuran, has shown microbial activity in vitro against a wide range of bacteria and fungi, and against several protozoa. The antimicrobial activity of the nitrofuran is not significantly diminished in vitro in the presence of 50% human serum. The compound is not cross-resistant with a number of common antibiotics or synthetic antimicrobial agents; some cross-resistance with furazolidone is encountered. The development of resistance to the compound in vitro, when it occurs, is mixed, but is unrelated to increase in pathogenicity of the test organism.
