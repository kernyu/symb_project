We studied 192 recent clinical isolates, comprising six species of Gram-negative bacilli resistant either to cefotaxime or latamoxef (Moxalactam), from several hospitals. All isolates were resistant to several other third-generation cephalosporins or a monobactam. Two to five types of chromosomal beta-lactamases, as defined by isoelectric focusing, were readily identified in each species. Isolates of Citrobacter, Enterobacter and Serratia produced higher levels of chromosomal beta-lactamase than corresponding cefotaxime-susceptible strains. In addition, 20 of 57 produced one or two plasmid-determined beta-lactamases, TEM-1, OXA-2, or a novel enzyme, OHIO-1. The penem and carbapenem antibiotics, Sch 34343 and imipenem, were more active than cefotaxime, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, latamoxef and aztreonam against isolates of Acinetobacter, Citrobacter, Ent. aerogenes, Ent. cloacae and Morganella, whereas imipenem, ceftazidime, and aztreonam were more active against Serratia isolates. The addition of plasmid-determined beta-lactamase increased resistance to piperacillin, cefoperazone and cefamandole but not to cefotaxime, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, latamoxef, aztreonam, Sch 34343, or imipenem. Of 24 strains susceptible to aminoglycosides, none produced a plasmid-determined beta-lactamase, whereas 20 were found among the 33 strains resistant to aminoglycosides. Resistance of clinical isolates to newer beta-lactams appears to be due primarily to a high level of chromosomal cephalosporinase present without inducing agents. The plasmid-determined beta-lactamases, TEM-1 and OHIO-1, contributed little to resistance to most of the newer beta-lactams but were strongly associated with aminoglycoside resistance in these selected isolates. The greater in-vitro efficacy of the penem and carbapenem antibiotics, Sch 34343 and imipenem, against most of these isolates makes them promising candidates as first line agents against these pathogens.
