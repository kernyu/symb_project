Two recombinant plasmids pPBT9 and pPBT74 carrying HindIII promoter-active DNA fragments of Bacillus thuringiensis onto the vector pGA24 were studied. The cloned fragment of pPBT9 plasmid has many homologous regions in Bac. thuringiensis genome. This fragment contains three Escherichia coli RNA polymerase binding sites, one of which is responsible for promoting tetracycline resistance of the promoter-deficient enterobacterial tet gene in E. coli cells. The bacillar fragment of pPBT74 plasmid has a single RNA polymerase binding site. Plasmids pPBT9 and pPBT74 were joined to the bacillar vectors pBD8 and pBD12 to obtain bireplicon plasmids which replicate in E. coli and Bac. subtilis cells. The novel bireplicon plasmids pSTS98, pSTS912 and pSTS748 promote the expression of the enterobacterial tet gene under control of regulatory signals of cloned DNA fragments of Bac. thuringiensis in Bac. subtilis. Bireplicon pSTS228 plasmid containing its own enterobacterial promoter of tet gene was not able to express tetracycline resistance in Bac. subtilis cells. Most of the bireplicon plasmids studied were unstable in Bac. subtilis but not in E. coli cells.
