Amikacin sulfate, the first semisynthetic aminoglycoside antibiotic introduced in this country, is resistant to the bacterial enzymes that specifically inactivate kanamycin sulfate, gentamicin sulfate, and tobramycin sulfate. This agent is potentially effective, therefore, against many serious infections caused by Gram-negative organisms resistant to other aminoglycosides. It appears to be similar to gentamicin in its in vitro spectrum, in clinical applications, and in the incidence and severity of adverse reactions reported. Like the other drugs in this class, amikacin can cause renal and otic toxic reactions.
