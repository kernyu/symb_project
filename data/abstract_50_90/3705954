Lysozyme is an important resistance factor in the respiratory defence mechanism. Few reports exist concerning its effects on the ciliary activity of the human nasal mucosa. To clarify the biological activity of lysozyme in ciliary movement, a quantitative study was undertaken using a photo-electrical method to measure ciliary beats in vitro under conditions of constant temperature. Egg-white lysozyme in a 0.01 M sodium phosphate buffer solution, pH 7.4, dose-dependently accelerated the ciliary beats in the human nasal mucosa, removing overlying mucus continuously for at least 60 min. The buffer alone, however, failed to affect ciliary beats. These results indicate that egg-white lysozyme directly promotes the ciliary beats in the human nasal mucosa.
