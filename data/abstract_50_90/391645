The mutant pEG1 of R-factor RP4 with temperature-sensitive defect in replication, carrying a transposable ampicillin resistance element Tn1 was used to define the frequency of insertion of this element into Escherichia coli K-12 chromosome and some other plasmids. Our results indicate that the frequency of colony forming by bacteria with pEG1-factor on ampicillin medium in non-permissive conditions corresponds to the frequency of Tn1 insertion into bacterial chromosome or some other plasmid (in case when the strains are carrying a second plasmid). The frequency of Tn1 insertion into the chromosome is about 4.10(-4). The defect in recA gene produce no serious change in the frequency of Tn1 insertion into the bacterial chromosome. The translocation of Tn1 element from pEG1-factor to R483, R6 and ColE1 plasmids occurs at 10 to 100-fold-higher frequency than from the plasmid to the chromosome. The insertion of Tn1 into the F'-factor KLF10 and R-factor R64-11 occurs at far lower frequency than that to plasmids R6, R483, or ColE1.
