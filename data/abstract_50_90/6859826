A total of 373 strains of S. typhi isolated in 1970-1982 were tested with respect to their sensitivity to 9 antibiotics active against gram-negative bacteria. It was shown that about 1/3 of the isolates were resistant to 1-3 antibiotics. Among the resistant isolates the number of strains resistant to 4-5 and more antibiotics amounted to 12.5 per cent. The plasmid nature of the antibiotic resistance in the isolated strains of S. typhi was shown. Transmissive R plasmids were detected in 13 per cent of the strains studied. Within the last 5 years there was an increase in the proportion of strains with transmissive R plasmids in patients with sporadic typhoid fever or especially in groups of patients with the disease.
