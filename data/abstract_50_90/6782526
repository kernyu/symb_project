During the period 1975 to 1979, 88 isolates of Neisseria meningitidis from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), 28 isolates from blood, and 89 isolates from other sources were serogrouped and tested for their susceptibility to sulphadiazine, penicillin, minocycline and rifampin. Prior to 1979, isolates from CSF or blood were predominantly serogroup B. In the sample tested, the prevalence of this serogroup decreased while the prevalence of serogroup A isolates increased, until in 1979 this was the predominant serogroup. From 1975, the incidence of sulphonamide-resistance in the serogroup B isolates from CSF or blood decreased. However, all serogroup A isolates from these sources, except the first one tested, were sulphonamide-resistant. The 89 isolates from other sources remained predominantly sulphonamide-sensitive serogroup B. All isolates were sensitive to penicillin, minocycline and rifampin.
