Gartner, T. K. (University of California, Santa Barbara), and E. Orias. Effects of mutations to streptomycin resistance on the rate of translation of mutant genetic information. J. Bacteriol. 91:1021-1028. 1966.-The effects of mutations to streptomycin resistance of independent origin upon the translation of suppressible mutant information were studied in an isogenic series of strains of Escherichia coli. The group of suppressible mutants included 1 mutation in the z gene of the lac operon of E. coli (O(0) (2) allele), 12 mutations distributed among the two rII cistrons of T4, and 13 mutations distributed among at least five cistrons of phage T7. It was concluded that the mutations to streptomycin resistance cause a significant decrease in the rate of translation of the suppressible codons, and that this effect is limited to a few types of codons.
