Classical enterobacterial strains are sensitive to the working concentrations of pervomur, dioxydine, resorcinol, sodium sulfacyl, iodopyrone, chlorhexidine and boric acid, resistant to the action of cetyplyridinium chloride, rivanol, roccal and ethonium. In enterobacterial populations strains with acquired resistance to chloramine B, iodopyrone, chlorhexidine and resorcinol are present. Hospital strains of enterobacteria are characterized by higher, in comparison with extrahospital strains, resistance to ethonium, sodium sulfacyl, lodopyrone, chloramine B and resorcinol.
