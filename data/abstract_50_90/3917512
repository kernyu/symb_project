Silver sulfadiazine-resistant organisms are arising at an irregular rate and may eventually interfere with wound management. To counter this problem several new antibacterial agents were tested in combination with silver sulfadiazine. Only sodium piperacillin (Pipracil, Lederle) exhibited synergism with silver sulfadiazine both in vitro (against various species of organisms) and in burned animals. The MIC of AgSD and Pipracil was 50 nmole/ml and 250 nmole/ml, respectively, but a combination of 6 nmole/ml of AgSD and 7.5 nmole/ml of Pipracil inhibited the growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In burned mice infected with either AgSD-resistant or sensitive strains, the mortality in groups receiving combinations of topical Pipracil and silver sulfadiazine was 0-10%; in contrast, treatment with Pipracil or silver sulfadiazine alone resulted in much higher mortality. Thus it would appear that a combination of silver sulfadiazine and Pipracil, each of which have long been used in patients topically and parenterally, may prove valuable in patients with burn wound infections related to or caused by organisms resistant to silver sulfadiazine.
