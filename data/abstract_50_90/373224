The antibiotic resistance patterns and the distribution of R-factors among Escherichia coli isolated from apparently healthy dogs, cattle, sheep and horses were studied. It was found that 102 strains (16.48 per cent) of a total of 619 isolates were resistant to one or more drugs. Twenty-six per cent (27 strains) of the resistant strains were capable of transferring either a part or the entire resistance patterns to the sensitive recipient strain. These results indicates that antibiotic resistance and R-factors are not particularly widespread among animals whose diet does not cotain antimicrobial drugs.
