Intensity of glycolysis and the pentose phosphate cycle in staphylococci sensitive and resistant to novobiocin was studied. The resistant variants did not practically store lactate and the activity of glycolytic enzymes i.e. hexokinase and aldolase was lowered by 15-20 and 53-59 per cent, respectively. Monoiodoacetate, a glycolysis inhibitor suppressed the glucose oxidation rate by 53.3-66.9 per cent in the sensitive variants and by 16-21.8 per cent in the resistant variants. At the same time it was characteristic of the resistant variants to increase the activity of the pentose phosphate cycle enzymes; glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase by 25-38.1 per cent transketolase by 21.5-27.3 per cent and transaldolase by 30-57.1 per cent. No differences in the transhydrogenase reaction kinetics of both the novobiocin sensitive and the novobiocin resistant variants were observed.
