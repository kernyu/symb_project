The resolvase gene and the putative res site of Tn2501 are not closely related to any of the previously described resolution functions. In view of this divergence, we designed genetic experiments to confirm the localization of the res site. We analyzed the activity of the Tn2501-encoded resolvase on substrates containing either directly or invertedly repeated res sites. These experiments confirm the localization of the res site that was predicted from nucleotide sequence data and show that the Tn2501 resolvase promotes site-specific inversions in vivo.
