Carriomycin, a new polyether antibiotic, was isolated from culture broth of Streptomyces hygroscopicus strain T-42082. It is active against Gram-positive bacteria, several fungi, yeasts and mycoplasma. It is also coccidiostatic. The free acid of carriomycin occurs as colorless prisms having the molecular formula C47H80O15 (M.W. 885.15), m.p. 120 approximately 122 degrees C and [alpha]25D -0.5 in methanol. It has no characteristic absorption maxima in the ultraviolet spectrum. The presence of one carboxyl and three methoxy groups was observed from its infrared, PMR and CMR spectra.
