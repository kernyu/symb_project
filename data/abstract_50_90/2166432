Forskolin (and other Cl- secretagogues) does not affect the very small Na(+)-originated short-circuit current (Isc) across frog corneal epithelium bathed in Cl- free solutions. However, forskolin in combination with increased PCO2 bubbling of the solutions (5-20% CO2) stimulated Isc proportionally to PCO2 to a maximum of approximately 8 microA/cm2. This current could be eliminated and reinstated by sequentially changing the gas composition of the bubbling to 100% air and 20% CO2-80% air. The same effects were observed when PCO2 changes were limited to the apical-side solution. Stroma-to-tear HCO3- movement was deemed unlikely, since the increase in Isc was observed with a HCO3(-)-free solution on the stromal side and CO2 gassing limited to the tear side. From the effects of ouabain and tryptamine, at least 80% of the Isc across the basolateral membrane can be accounted for by the Na+ pump current plus K+ movement from cell to bath. Methazolamide also inhibited Isc. Current across the apical membrane cannot be attributed to an electronegative Na(+)-HCO3- symport given the insensitivity of Isc to a disulfonic stilbene and the fact that stroma-to-tear Na+ fluxes did not increase on stimulation of Isc. The tear-to-stroma Na+ flux also remained unaltered, negating an increased apical bath-to-cell Na+ flow. The forskolin-20% CO2 manipulation produced a depolarization of the intracellular potential, a reduction in the apical-to-basolateral resistance ratio, and a decrease in transepithelial resistance.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
