The role of the outer membrane (OM) was investigated in relation to the high level of intrinsic antibiotic resistance of Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 9027. OM penetration barriers were measured by comparing turbidimetric growth curves of EDTA-treated and normal cells exposed to carbenicillin, moxalactam (LY 127935), gentamicin, tobramycin, rifampin, novobiocin, and vancomycin. OM barriers were also measured for carbenicillin and moxalactam in P. aeruginosa strain K 799/61, a hypersusceptible mutant presumed to have lost its penetration barrier in the cell envelope. Most antibiotics penetrated the OM efficiently and there was little difference between the two strains. The evidence therefore suggests that intrinsic resistance of P. aeruginosa, especially to the beta-lactam antibiotics, is not mainly due to the OM. A penetration barrier situated deeper within the cell envelope is hypothesized, the size of which in relation to any antibiotic may be estimated by comparing the IC50 values of EDTA-treated cells of the two strains.
