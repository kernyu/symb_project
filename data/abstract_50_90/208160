Two cases of post-meningococcal inflammatory arthritis with a relapsing course in one case are reported. The authors then recall the characteristics of the joint manifestations during meningococcal infections in the light of other cases in the literature. These arthropathies are generally aseptic and their resistance to antibiotics is remarkable, whilst non- steroid anti-inflammatory drugs, even used alone as in one of the cases reported here, are remarkably effective. The pathogenesis of these cases of arthritis is not clear: it seems however according to Greenwood and Whittle that they are manifestations of immuno-allergic type. This "post-meningococcal rheumatism" may be compared to the gonococcal rheumatism of certain cases of Reiter's syndrome.
