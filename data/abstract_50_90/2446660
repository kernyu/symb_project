The effects of the putative intracellular Ca2+ antagonist, TMB-8 (8-(N,N-diethylamino)octyl-3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoate), on the canine tracheal epithelium were examined. Luminal addition reduced rapidly, but reversibly, the transmucosal potential difference and increased the resistance across the open-circuited epithelium. Under short-circuit conditions, the drug reduced stimulation by prostaglandin E2, forskolin, 8-bromo cyclic AMP, prostaglandin F2 alpha and A23187. Inhibition of prostaglandin E2 responses were accompanied by reversal of net Cl- fluxes produced by the agonist. The effects of TMB-8 were unaffected by increasing Ca2+ in the bathing solutions, and were not mimicked by procaine, nitrendipine, calmidazolium, compound 48/80 or trifluoperazine. W7 did, to a limited extent, produce similar responses, though the drug was more toxic, and the effects were irreversible.
