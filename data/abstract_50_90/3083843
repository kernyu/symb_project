A retrospective analysis of 80 cases of gonococcal ophthalmia revealed six (7.5%) to be due to penicillinase-producing Neisseria gonorrhoeae (PPNG), five neonatal cases and one adult. All six cases were finally cured, but best results were obtained with topical chloramphenicol and single-dose spectinomycin (40 mg/kg) given intramuscularly. All gonococcal isolates should be tested promptly for penicillinase production, and if this is present systemic treatment, modified to spectinomycin or penicillinase-stable cephalosporin, should be given as single-dose treatment.
