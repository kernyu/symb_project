Susceptibility in vitro of 179 staphylococcal strains from 107 cystic fibrosis patients against 31 antibiotics indicates that only teicoplanin, vancomycin and netilmicin were active against all strains. The use of betalactam antibiotics is impaired by 11.7% of methicillin-resistant strains. The bactericidal kinetics of cephalexin and flucloxacillin as determined in a pharmacodynamic model demonstrates the killing of strains resistant to cephalexin (MIC 8 mg/l to 32 mg/l) by flucloxacillin. For the rational selection of antistaphylococcal antibiotics for cystic fibrosis patients, both the MIC of the isolates and the concentration of the antibiotics in cystic fibrosis patients have to be considered.
