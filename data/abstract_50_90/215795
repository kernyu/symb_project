We performed a controlled double-blind clinical study with PMPC to investigate its therapeutic usefulness in acute simple cystitis in comparison with NA, with the results as follows: 1. In both treatment groups, PMPC proved to be remarkably more active (MIC) than NA against the bacterial isolates tested in vitro. 2. PMPC, administered in dosis (200 mg per day) one-tenth those of NA (2,000 mg per day), produced a greater improvement (therapeutic effects) than NA. 3. Side-effects were apparently less frequent with PMPC, as compared to NA. The results indicate a remarkable usefulness of PMPC in the treatment of acute simple cystitis.
