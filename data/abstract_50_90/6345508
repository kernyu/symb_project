A plasmid-containing wild-type Escherichia coli strain was treated with two plasmid-curing agents, sodium dodecyl sulfate and ethidium bromide. Plasmid elimination was accompanied by drastic changes in the morphology of the colonies. Analysis of the cured strain by scanning and transmission electron microscopy showed important alterations in size and morphology of the cells. Metabolic differences were also found between the wild-type and cured cells.
