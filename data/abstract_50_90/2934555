Interferon-induced gene expression was analyzed in wild-type and interferon-resistant Daudi cells. Two classes of alpha-interferon-induced mRNAs and proteins were observed: those that were similarly induced in both types of cell and those that were induced only in the wild-type cells. Furthermore, the level of c-myc mRNA decreased in the wild-type but not in the resistant cells. This differential control in the wild-type and resistant cells indicates that there must be either functionally distinct alpha-interferon receptors or more than one pathway leading to altered gene expression triggered by a single receptor.
