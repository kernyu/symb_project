Specific antivirals like acyclovir have ameliorated the outcome of severe herpesvirus infections, especially in immunocompromised patients. Varicella can be prevented in high-risk patients after exposure by therapy with varicella-zoster immunoglobulin. Despite this favorable development, there are many unresolved problems in the management of herpesvirus infections, such as the use of acyclovir during pregnancy, the treatment of both motoric neuropathy and postherpetic neuralgia. Chemotherapy-resistant herpesvirus may cause severe syndromes in patients suffering from HIV infection or from iatrogenic immunosuppression. Isolation of resistant viruses provides the stimulus to establish tests of viral resistance and to use antiviral drugs more carefully.
