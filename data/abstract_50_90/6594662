Formocresol was checked with respect to its in vivo fixative effect after pulpotomy, through observation of tissue resistance to necrosis. The root pulps were freed from their hard-tissue wrapping and processed for 48 hours, followed or not by capping (15 days) with zinc oxide-eugenol or with zinc oxide-eugenol-formocresol. The effect of only capping with zinc oxide-eugenol, with or without formocresol, was also recorded.
