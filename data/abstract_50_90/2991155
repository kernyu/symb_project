Restriction enzyme analysis was utilized to investigate 11 HSV isolates from patients with herpetic keratitis. The electrophoretic profiles of the DNAs indicate that the isolates belong to HSV-1 and are epidemiologically unrelated. Two of the isolates, derived from a patient with simultaneous bilateral herpetic keratitis were further characterized by genetic and phenotypic analyses. These studies showed the following: (i) the two recrudescent lesions were caused by the same HSV-1 isolate; (ii) the isolate yielded two different plaque phenotypes; (iii) these plaques showed different sensitivity to I.D.U.
