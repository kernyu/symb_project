A review is given of current problems in the chemotherapy of infections caused by coagulase-negative staphylococci. Along with the recent increase in the number of these infections has come the realisation that such infections may be difficult to treat. The sites of infection caused by coagulase-negative staphylococci are considered and recent advances in the understanding of the molecular biology of these organisms reviewed. Appropriate antibiotic therapy for individual infections is discussed, likewise the contribution the laboratory can make to ensure that the most effective antibiotics are used.
