Transformational separation of plasmids from R404 plasmid aggregate found in Salmonella enteritidis strain was performed. Three classes of transformants differing in their resistance patterns were isolated. Genetic properties of the transformants suggest that their resistance is determined by single plasmids. Plasmid pCK3 (Tra-ApCbCrSuSm) and pCK4 (Tra-ApCbCrCm) are nonconjugative while plasmid pCG1 (TraApCbCrSuSmTcKmNm) is conjugative. Separation of all plasmids of R404 plasmid aggregate allowed to determine their genetic properties and the manner of conjugational transfer of R404 plasmid aggregate R-determinants.
