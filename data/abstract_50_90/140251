Neisseria gonorrhoeae resistant to high levels of spectinomycin (more than 2,048 microng/ml), were isolated from specimens obtained from a patient with urethritis. The bacterial resistance to spectinomycin is probably due to ribosomal changes that are a result of a chromosomal mutation. If spectinomycin fails to cure gonorrhea, spectinomycin resistance should be considered.
