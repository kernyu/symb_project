Lately, reports about bensylpenicillin-resistant meningococci have been made in Germany which ensued the presentation of results regarding MIC determinations of 82 strains freshly isolated from carriers. The geometric mean of all MIC values amounts to 0.026 mu/ml which value never exceeds 0.06 mu/ml which is why further spreading of benzylpenicillin-resistant meningococci does not appear to be likely as yet.
