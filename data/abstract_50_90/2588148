Eighteen patients with acute granulocytic leukemia (MI-1, M2-10, M3-1 and M4-6) underwent AdOAP treatment. Complete remissions were achieved in 10 out of the 18 patients (55.6%), 3 patients proved resistant, 5 had died prior to recovery of normal hemopoiesis. Three lethal cases are attributed to the results of the therapy complications. Median duration of complete remissions reached 17.5 months. Two patients have been in remission over 3 years. Reduced duration or intensity of the induction therapy failed to diminish frequency of lethal complications due to progressive cytopenia.
