The effect of a chemically synthesized polyprenol derivative, dihydroheptaprenol (DHP), on the nonspecific resistance of mice to infection with Escherichia coli was investigated. Mice that had been injected intramuscularly with 100 mg of DHP per kg of body weight, prepared as a microemulsion with lecithin, 1 to 4 days before infection showed enhanced resistance to subcutaneous (s.c.) infection with E. coli. When DHP-injected mice were inoculated s.c. with 3 X 10(8) E. coli, which induces fatal acute systemic infection in normal mice, propagation of bacteria in the blood, liver, and spleen was significantly inhibited. Enhanced resistance of athymic (nude) mice to E. coli infection was also induced by DHP. DHP markedly stimulated the generation of peripheral blood neutrophils, significantly enhanced clearance of E. coli from the bloodstream, and activated neutrophils and peritoneal macrophages for H2O2 generation. DHP restored the resistance to E. coli infection in cyclophosphamide-treated mice over the normal level. Furthermore, DHP shortened the period of the recovery of neutrophils and also enhanced clearance of E. coli from the bloodstream in cyclophosphamide-treated mice. DHP was nontoxic for mice and rats (400 mg/kg intramuscularly and 800 mg/kg s.c.) and nonpyrogenic at a dose of 30 mg/kg when administered intravenously to rabbits. These results suggest that the mechanism of action of DHP for enhancing resistance in mice may be, at least in part, its ability to stimulate the generation of potent neutrophils and to activate macrophages in the reticuloendothelial system.
