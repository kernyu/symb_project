A new cephem cefminox (CMNX, MT-141) was used in the treatment of 22 cases of respiratory tract infections without taking into account background factors of patients. The dosage was 2 to 4 g/day in 2 divided doses and the treatment was continued for a period 2 to 17 days. The breakdown of the diseases treated was; pneumonia in 7 cases, secondary lung abscess (rS3)+middle lobe syndrome in 1 case, chronic bronchitis in 3 cases, bronchiectasis in 10 cases and intrapulmonary lymphangitis carcinomatosa (suspected) in 1 case. The clinical results were rated as excellent in 7 cases, good in 11 cases, fair in 1 case and unknown in 3 cases, with an excellent rate of 36.8% and excellent+good rate of 94.7%. The causative organisms were identified in 10 cases and included H. influenzae for 8 cases, Klebsiella sp. for 1 case and S. aureus for 1 case. The analysis of bacteriological study revealed disappearance of all of these organisms. However, in 3 out of 8 cases where H. influenzae was isolated and in 1 case where Klebsiella sp. was isolated the changes of organisms to P. aeruginosa were observed. As the adverse reactions, rashes developed in 1 case and moreover laboratory test results revealed elevation in transaminase in 3 cases. All of these symptoms were mild in nature and none of our cases experienced serious adverse reactions attributable to CMNX. From these results, we believe that CMNX is one of the useful drugs for the treatment of respiratory tract infections.
