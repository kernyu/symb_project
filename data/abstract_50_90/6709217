In recent years, the diffusion of antibiotic multiresistant staphylococcus strains in hospitals (especially aureus and epidermis) has created serious drawbacks as regards the treatment of severe septic forms and the systemic spread of these bacteria. The results of endovenous vancomycin treatment in three cases of sepsis with secondary localisations (endocarditis, osteomyelitis, pneumonia) caused by gram positive staphylococcus aureus are examined. The pharmaceutical was found to be effective in all cases and free from significant side effects.
