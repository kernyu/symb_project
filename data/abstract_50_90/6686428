The physiological and morphofunctional properties of the polyene-sensitive and resistant mutants of fungus producing fusidic acid were studied comparatively. The highly active nystatin resistant mutant was characterized by the decreased growth rates, lowered sporulation levels, retarded synthesis of nucleic acids and protein, lower respiration activity and higher mycelium lipid contents. The ultrastructural investigation of the polyene-resistant strain revealed the presence of lower numbers of ribosomes, membrane structures and mitochondria. Destructive changes in mitochondria and lipid masses in the hyphal cytoplasm were also observed.
