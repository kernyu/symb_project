Polymyxin B affects neuromuscular transmission by blocking acetylcholine receptors. Its action is thus post-synaptic and the neuromuscular block has no antagonists. Polymyxin B causes neostigmine resistance to d-tubocurarine blockade and calcium resistance to the blockade evoked by aminoglycosidic antibiotics. Thus it increases the possibility of definitive arrest of respiration.
