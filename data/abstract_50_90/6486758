A susceptibility survey of 537 strains of the Bacteroides fragilis group from eight centers in the United States was continued at the Tufts New England Medical Center in 1982. The results were compared with those of 755 organisms analyzed in 1981. Nine antimicrobial agents were tested by an agar dilution method. The respective percentages of resistance for 1981 and 1982 were as follows (%): cefoxitin, 8 and 10; moxalactam, 22 and 12; cefotaxime, 54 and 48; cefoperazone, 57 and 54; piperacillin, 12 and 7; clindamycin, 6 and 3; metronidazole, 0 and 0; chloramphenicol, 0 and 0; and tetracycline, 63 and 59. Regional differences in resistance rates were found. Declines in resistance to moxalactam, piperacillin, and clindamycin were noted at the participating hospitals. An outbreak of cefoxitin resistance was noted at the Tufts New England Medical Center, where the rate increased from 14 to 30%. The various species of the B. fragilis group had differing patterns of resistance; B. fragilis was the most susceptible species. Significant cross resistance among the beta-lactam agents was found. These data indicate the need to determine the susceptibility patterns of the B. fragilis group organisms within each hospital.
