A recombinant plasmid containing the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (tk) gene, flanked on one side by two murine immunoglobulin heavy chain diversity (D) elements and on the other by two murine immunoglobulin heavy chain joining (JH) elements, was introduced into a tk- variant of a pre-B cell line transformed by Abelson murine leukemia virus. The four possible site-specific joining events between the D and JH segments within the integrated construct occurred frequently during passage of the cloned line under nonselective conditions, and deletion of the internal tk gene as a result of these joining events was, by far, the predominant mechanism of resistance to BUdR within this line. These studies demonstrate that a precise chromosomal location is not essential for the assembly of D and JH elements and provide a model system for mechanistic and genetic studies of this recombination process.
