A modified Bauer-Kirby-Sherris-Turck method for disc susceptibility testing of anaerobic bacteria is presented. When tetracycline was used against 100 strains of Bacteroides fragilis as a model, reasonably reproducible results were obtained after overnight incubation in both the GasPak atmosphere and an atmosphere achieved by adding 10% CO(2) to a mixture of 10% H(2) and 90% N(2). The minimal inhibitory concentration for the strains determined by the agar dilution technique correlated well with the results of disc tests performed in the GasPak atmosphere with 30-mug tetracycline discs. Among 63 strains isolated from 1970 to the present, only 24 (38.1%) were found to be susceptible to tetracycline.
