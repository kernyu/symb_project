We compared the in vitro activities of 9 aminoglycosides including trospectomycin sulfate against 250 selected strains of Neisseria gonorrhoeae according to their penicillin resistance (penicillinase production), streptomycin resistance, spectinomycin resistance. Trospectomycin sulfate inhibited all spectinomycin-sensible strain at a concentration of 4 mg/l but the spectinomycin-resistant strain needed 32 mg/l for its inhibition. Among the other aminoglycosides tested netilmicin had the most in vitro effectiveness. Its minimal inhibitory concentrations were comparable to that of trospectomycin sulfate: furthermore this compound demonstrated in vitro activity against the spectino-resistant strain.
