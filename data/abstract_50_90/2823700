Trimethoprim resistance dihydrofolate reductase genes from plasmids known to be exchanging between human and animal populations were mapped. The dihydrofolate reductase gene has been highly conserved in all plasmids, but differences in the flanking regions provide evidence that the most recent exchange of plasmids between the two ecosystems has been from animals to humans.
