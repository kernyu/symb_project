In group practice, screening for bacteriuria and antibacterial susceptibility testing of bacteria in urine specimens were performed by dipslide methods (Uricult and Sensicult, Orion Diagnostica) and the results were evaluated with respect to conventional cultivation of urine specimens and standardized susceptibility testing by the disc diffusion method at a bacteriological laboratory. Bacteriuria diagnosis by screening by the Uricult method seemed to be satisfactorily performed except for some streptococcal strains. In the case of direct susceptibility testing by the Sensicult dipslide method, however, the results obtained by personnel at the surgeries and by trained bacteriologists displayed unacceptable disparities, despite the fact that a continuously running training programme was established.
