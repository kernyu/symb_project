The in vitro activity of enoxacin was tested against 1000 clinical isolates of gram-positive and gram-negative microorganisms and compared with that of norfloxacin and amikacin. The MIC90 of enoxacin was 1 mg/l for Enterobacteriaceae, 2.6 mg/l for Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 6.2 mg/l or Staphylococcus aureus. The inoculum effect was minimal. The MICs and MBCs for Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains were significantly affected by the addition of calcium and magnesium ions. Synergy was occasionally observed between enoxacin and the antibiotics tested; antagonism was rare.
