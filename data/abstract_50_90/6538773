The in vitro synergistic activity of aztreonam in combination with piperacillin, moxalactam, cefotaxime, cefoperazone, and amikacin was examined against multiply resistant isolates of the family Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Aztreonam in combination with amikacin demonstrated synergy against 71% of the isolates, whereas combinations of aztreonam plus a second beta-lactam demonstrated synergy against 42% of the isolates.
