Based on the data obtained during observation over 270 patients with infectious endocarditis the authors discuss factors that cause antibacterial therapy resistance encountered particularly often over the recent decade. Among the factors, the authors mark polyetiology of the disease over the recent years, "new" patterns of endocarditis in terms of the pathogenesis, predominance of primary endocarditis with highly virulent microorganisms, late disease diagnosis, inadequate antibacterial treatment, and so forth. Approaches to overcoming treatment resistance are also considered.
