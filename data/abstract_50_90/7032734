During an outbreak of urban malaria in Choluteca, Honduras, the response of local isolates of Plasmodium falciparum to chloroquine was assessed. The 7-day WHO alternative standard field test was used together with three in vitro tests: the Rieckmann macro- and micromethods and a new 48-hour test which underwent its first field trial in this study. No chloroquine resistance was found in in vivo tests in 10 patients or in the in vitro tests on blood samples from 6 patients.
