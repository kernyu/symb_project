In Norfolk, Virginia, two epidemics of disease due to proved penicillinase-producing Neisseria gonorrhoeae were investigated intensively, both epidemiologically and medically. The first epidemic appeared in October 1976 and was controlled in one month; it was followed by a hiatus of four years before the emergence of the second epidemic in October 1980. The latter apparently was brought under control by December 1980, since no more patients with penicillinase-producing N. gonorrhoeae have been discovered to date (March 1982). Certain interesting medical aspects emerged from the investigation. Resistant organisms were cultured from asymptomatic as well as symptomatic patients and from all potentially infected sites. At times, resistant organisms were cultured from only one of several sites in a given patient or both resistant and sensitive organisms were cultured from a single site. It was concluded that this type of gonorrhea can be contained by intensive epidemiologic investigation combined with adequate diagnosis and treatment.
