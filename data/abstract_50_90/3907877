Between April and June 1984, eight chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum malaria cases were observed in non-immune patients after their emergency sanitary return from NE Mozambique. In vivo resistance to amodiaquine and pyrimethamine were demonstrated from two isolates. Radical cure was obtained with mefloquine in all cases. These patients came from an expatriate community of 35 adult men among which six other chloroquine-resistant malarial cases were probable. The epidemic pattern of this chloroquine-resistant focus is underlined.
