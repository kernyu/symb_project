The acyclovir resistant mutant of varicella-zoster virus ACV-R (A 8) induced the same level of thymidine kinase activity in infected cells as the parent Kawaguchi strain. However, it induced less deoxycytidine kinase activity and did not induce phosphorylating activity for the nucleotide analogue, 9-(2 hydroxy-ethoxymethyl)-guanine-(acyclovir). Another acyclovir resistant mutant, ACV-R (A 4), which is cross-resistant to phosphonoacetate and is thought to be a viral DNA polymerase mutant, induced the same level of phosphorylating activities for thymidine, deoxycytidine and acyclovir as the parent strain. The altered substrate specificity of thymidine kinase induced by ACV-R (A 8) is concluded to confer resistance to acyclovir on ACV-R (A 8).
