Sheared DNA from RPI, and R plasmid from a strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, was used to transform other strains of P. aeruginosa and Escherichia coli. From transformed cells other plasmids like RPI were isolated. These deletion plasmids were conjugally transferrable and confer resistance mainly against carbenicillin and tetracycline.
