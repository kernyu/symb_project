Antimicrobial activity of pure preparations of mycotoxins and fungal metabolites was studied against strains of Bacillus thuringiensis (Berliner). Two resistant strains, called stable-variant, were isolated after treatment with high concentrations of aflatoxin B1. These strains were then resistant also towards compounds with a double furan system (aflatoxins B1, B2, G1, G2, and sterigmatocystin).
