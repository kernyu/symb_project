Various natural and synthetic interferon inducers stimulate postvaccination immunity to tick-borne encephalitis virus in mice. This capacity was found not only in macromolecular synthetic polyribonucleotides such as (poly I)-(poly C), (poly G)-(poly C), (poly A)-(poly U) and substances with much lower molecular weight such as copolymers of vinylpyrrolidone with maleic anhydride, crotonic acid or metacrylic acid but also in a low molecular interferon inducer tiloron. These and other interferon inducers examined (endotoxin S-typhi, statolon) exhibited no parallelism between the intensity of their stimulating effect of immunogenesis and levels of interferon production induced in mice and the associated resistance to tick-borne encephalitis. The results indicate a possibliity of using various interferon inducers for stimulation of post-vaccination immunity to tick-borne encephalitis.
