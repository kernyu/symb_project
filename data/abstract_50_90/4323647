Strains of Blastomyces dermatitidis, Sporothrix schenckii, Histoplasma capsulatum, Cryptococcus neoformans, Nocardia asteroides, and Coccidioides immitis were tested for in vitro susceptibility to polymyxin, gentamicin, kanamycin, chloramphenicol, and neomycin at concentrations of 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16 mug/ml. Polymyxin was the most inhibitory and gentamicin was the least inhibitory of the five antibiotics. Two Histoplasma mycelial strains were partially inhibited by 2 and 8 mug of gentamicin per ml and showed at least a 2+ growth at the higher antibiotic concentration. Kanamycin and neomycin produced significant inhibition of N. asteroides but otherwise were noninhibitory. A combination of chloramphenicol and kanamycin, each at 16 mug/ml, and gentamicin, at 4 mug/ml, was noninhibitory to the strains tested except for N. asteroides. Chloramphenicol at 16 mug/ml was not inhibitory for N. asteroides. The results suggest that the optimal antibiotic combination to use in the isolation of fungi and higher bacteria is chloramphenicol, 16 mug/ml, and gentamicin, 4 mug/ml. Addition of sheep blood (5%) had no effect on antibiotic susceptibility of the organisms studied.
