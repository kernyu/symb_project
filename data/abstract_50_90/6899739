One hundred and fifty-two strains of Bacteroides fragilis were tested by agar dilution technique against 7 antimicrobial agents. Metronidazole at 1 microgram/ml and chloramphenicol at 8 microgram/ml inhibited all the strains tested. Cefoxitin at 32 microgram/ml and carbenicillin at 128 microgram/ml were active against nearly all strains. On the other hand, only 92% of the strains of B. fragilis were inhibited by clindamycin at 4 microgram/ml. Erythromycin and tetracycline were less active against B. fragilis.
