Drug resistance patterns of shigella strains were investigated in a prospective manner in Etimesgut district during a period of 1 year. Thirty strains shigella were isolated, belonged to three subgroups with preponderance of Sh. flexneri (70%), followed by Sh. sonnei (27%) and Sh. boydii (3%). The resistance was highest with streptomycin (80%), followed by trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMZ) (53%) and ampicillin (43%). Only three strains (10%) were sensitive to all eight antibiotics tested. Sixteen (53%) were resistant to three or more antibiotics. The data showed an increase in resistance to the commonly used antimicrobial agents--namely IMP-SMZ and ampicillin. IMP-SMZ is no longer the drug of choice in severe shigellosis, at least in this region of Turkey.
