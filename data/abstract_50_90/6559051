Relationship between the resistance of Klebsiella spp. to beta-lactam antibiotics and the capacity of ampicillin and cephaloridin for penetration through the cell wall of this organism was studied. It was shown that Klebsiella sp. 182 and 600 were more sensitive to cephaloridin and more resistant to ampicillin than Klebsiella sp. D 535. Estimation of the cryptic index showed that the resistance of Klebsiella sp. 182 and 600 was mainly connected with permeability of their cell walls. In Klebsiella sp. D 535 ampicillin freely penetrated through the cell wall. In the strains tested, the levels of the resistance to oxacillin, benzylpenicillin and dicloxacillin correlated with the values of the cryptic index characterizing barrier function of the cell wall.
