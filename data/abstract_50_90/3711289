Tests with 10-micrograms amdinocillin disks were performed in parallel with agar dilution tests and three different ranges of inoculum density. A resistance breakpoint of less than or equal to 13 mm and an intermediate category of 14 to 16 mm are recommended. Susceptible strains provided zones greater than or equal to 17 mm in diameter, but many appeared to be resistant by the agar dilution methods if the inoculum exceeded 10(4) CFU per spot.
