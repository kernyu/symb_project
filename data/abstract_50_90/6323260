Only one polypeptide specified by plasmid pBR322 is necessary to determine tetracycline resistance. Small deletions in pBR322 constructed in vitro which result in the lack of ability to confer tetracycline resistance in vivo also result in the absence or alteration of this polypeptide in vivo. Other deletions define the extent of material necessary to encode this polypeptide. A correction to the DNA sequence of the tetracycline resistance cistron has been determined which confirms these observations.
