Tn601, determinging kanamycin resistance of Escherichia coli, has been transposed into the bacteriophage lambda genome from R6 plasmid. After curing lambda gtc1857 (Tn601) lysogenes on the kanamycin containing medium, the clones with stable and unstable integrations of the Tn6-1 into the chromosome were obtained. After the lysogenization of these clones with the phage lambda att80c1857S7, the phages lambda att80c1857S7 (Tn601) were obtained. These phages contained the Tn601 from the sites of stable or unstable integrations. The frequency of the Tn601 transposition from the sites of unstable integration was 10(-7), that was two order of magnitude higher than the frequency of the Tn601 transpostion from the site of stable integration. Temperature induction of the lambda att80c1857 (Tn601) prophage resulted in 10--15 times increase of the yeild of aminoglycoside-3'-phosphotransferase I, the enzyme coded by the aphA gene of the Tn601.
