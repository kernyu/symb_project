During a 10-month period, skin culture specimens were taken from 1680 healthy outpatients with a variety of community-acquired skin infections. Staphylococcus aureus was found in 1035 (61.6%) of these patients. In vitro resistance to methicillin and erythromycin was 1.0% and 42.9%, respectively. Resistance rates to erythromycin in patients with furunculosis and impetigo were 51.5% and 26.2%, respectively (p less than 0.001). The emergence of erythromycin-resistant strains may be the result of widespread use of this drug in our geographic area. There is also the possibility that certain bacteriologic features associated with erythromycin resistance may foster the development of furunculosis.
