Somatic cell mutants resistant to drugs that interact with the eukaryotic ribosome provide a useful tool for studies on ribosome structure, function, and genetics. From Aedes albopictus (mosquito) cells, cycloheximide-resistant mutants (Cx-705 and Cx-738) that were about 30-fold more resistant to cycloheximide than the parental cells have been obtained. The observation that protein synthesis in cell-free lysates from Cx-705 and Cx-738 cells was resistant to cycloheximide led us to suspect that the alteration in these mutants might affect the ribosome. The present studies show that the cycloheximide-resistant cells grow poorly and eventually die at 34.5 degrees C, a temperature at which wild-type cells grow normally. Relative to control cells, the cycloheximide-resistant cells show increased sensitivity to G-418, another antibiotic that interacts with the eukaryotic ribosome. However, there were no differences between cycloheximide-resistant cells and wild-type cells in sensitivity to puromycin, emetine, or cryptopleurine. Cx-705 cells were predominantly diploid; in contrast, the frequency of tetraploid nuclei in Cx-738 cells was about 40%.
