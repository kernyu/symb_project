Urinary tract infections due to low-grade pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria show an increasing prevalence. The frequency of isolation from urinary samples of some of these pathogens (Alcaligenes, Citrobacter, Acinetobacter, Providencia, Serratia) was detected in a group of adult patients. The role of local and systemic predisposing factors was investigated. These bacterial agents accounted for 21% of 1,354 isolated strains. Systemic predisposing factors were found in most patients. Moreover, a high proportion of the isolates was found in the urinary samples of patients receiving prolonged antibacterial therapy. Sensitivity to several antibacterial drugs was examined for each strain. A high degree of drug resistance was commonly found.
