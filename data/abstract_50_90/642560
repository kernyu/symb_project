Fifty-two diabetic patients who underwent pulmonary surgery for coccidioiodmycosis were evaluated by a retrospective study which included classification by stage of disease, status of insulin dependency, and reaction to coccidioidin skin test. The insulin-dependent diabetic patient had a fourfold increase in the incidence of more severe (progressive) disease. Perioperative therapy with amphotericin B may be of value in the adult surgical candidate with progressive disease but is not necessary or desirable in the juvenile diabetic patient. Coccidioidomycosis is a disease of relative immunocompromise, and a negative skin test should herald such compromise and support a decision for surgery. Such surgery in the progressive stages should be totally extirpative. The presence of inadequately resected disease may adversely affect subsequent immunologic resistance of the host.
