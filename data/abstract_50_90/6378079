To show the distribution level of antibiotic resistant strains of Proteus and determine the identity of the strains of different origin, i.e. those isolated from humans, animals and environment, the sensitivity of 1084 strains of P. mirabilis and P. vulgaris to chloramphenicol, streptomycin, monomycin, ampicillin, kanamycin, gentamicin and rondomycin was studied with the method of serial dilutions in agar. 964 of them belonged to 28 O-antigen serogroups. Comparative analysis of the data showed that the strains resistant to the above antibiotics were present in all the Proteus groups studied. However, their frequency was different and depended on the antibiotic type and the serological group and origin of the strain. All the strains were resistant to chloramphenicol, while the number of the strains resistant to gentamicin was minimum and did not depend on their origin. The frequency of the rondomycin resistant strains among the isolates from the environment of the agricultural farms was significantly lower. The frequency of the strains resistant to kanamycin, streptomycin and monomycin was significantly higher among the isolates from humans. The difference in the Proteus strains of serogroups 03 and 041, as well as the other serogroups by the detection frequency and resistance to some antibiotics and the portion of the strains of the 4 resistant types or spectra was shown to be significant.
