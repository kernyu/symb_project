Many strains of cefazolin (CEZ)-resistant Staphylococcus aureus of recent clinical isolates were also resistant to gentamicin (GM). In addition, the antibacterial activity of NTL was found to be stronger than that of GM and stronger than that of CEZ for those resistant strains and especially for those moderately resistant to GM.
