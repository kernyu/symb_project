The dynamics of staphylococci sensitivity to antibiotics in purulent foci of 242 in patients was studied. Two criteria were used for estimation of the above process, i.e. (I) sensitivity to the antibiotics of the whole staphylococcal population isolated and (2) sensitivity to the antibiotics of separate strains isolated from the population. In 10 or more days the number of the in-patients with staphylococci resistant to streptomycin, monomycin or oxacillin in the purulent foci increased. The number of the in-patients with penicillin, neomycin or chloramphenicol resistant staphylocci was statistically doubtful. The average number of the antibiotic resistant microbial cells in the staphylococcal populations of the foci in the patients during their stay in the hospital increased 2-4 times.
