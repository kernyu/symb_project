In this work, we discuss the effects that the administration of both single and multiple doses of antibiotics are likely to have on antibiotic sensitivity of both the bacteria responsible for the infection and the human normal flora. It is concluded that a single-dose therapy when used under the appropriate conditions has the advantage of having less chances to select resistant strains in the normal bacterial flora.
