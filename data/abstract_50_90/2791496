The in vitro activity of lomefloxacin was compared to norfloxacin and two parenteral drugs against 2,813 clinical isolates at three medical centers in Brazil. Considering MICs less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml as the criterion, lomefloxacin inhibited 97.9% of all enterobacteriaceae, 100% of staphylococci, 100% of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, 100% of Campylobacter pylori, 81% of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 79% of Streptococcus spp. Norfloxacin was generally comparable in potency and spectrum, but cefotaxime and gentamicin were less effective because of high-resistance prevalence in some species. The highest rates of fluoro-quinolone resistance among the Enterobacteriaceae were in the Proteus-Providencia group of species.
