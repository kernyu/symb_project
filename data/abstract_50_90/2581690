Hepatocytes were isolated from B6C3F1 male mouse neoplastic livers (containing hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas) or two-thirds partially hepatectomized livers and tested in primary culture for their cytotoxic response to hepatotoxins. Partially hepatectomized mouse hepatocytes were less sensitive to lindane, methotrexate, diethylnitrosamine and adriamycin, and more sensitive to cycloheximide compared to normal mouse hepatocytes. Neoplastic hepatocytes were less sensitive to lindane and methotrexate, did not differ in cytotoxic response to diethylnitrosamine and adriamycin and were more sensitive to cycloheximide compared to normal mouse hepatocytes.
