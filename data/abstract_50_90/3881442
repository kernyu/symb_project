Interferon-alpha/beta induces in cells from mice carrying the influenza virus resistance allele Mx+ the synthesis of a unique 75,000-dalton protein (designated here protein Mx) that was not detectable in interferon-treated cells from Mx- mice lacking the resistance allele (Horisberger, M. A., Staeheli, P., and Haller, O. (1983) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 80, 1910-1914). We have immunized Mx- BALB/c mice with extracts of interferon-treated cells from congenic Mx+ BALB X A2G-Mx mice. Resulting hyperimmune sera immunoprecipitated a single interferon-inducible 75,000-dalton protein of Mx+ embryo cells. Sera did not react with any interferon-inducible protein of Mx- cells. Synthesis of the immunoprecipitable 75,000-dalton protein Mx was induced by interferon-alpha/beta but not by interferon-gamma in Mx+ cells of diverse genetic backgrounds. Monoclonal antibodies to protein Mx were selected in similar immunoprecipitation assays. One discrete in vitro translation product of relevant mRNA reacted with polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies and was indistinguishable from in vivo synthesized protein Mx.
