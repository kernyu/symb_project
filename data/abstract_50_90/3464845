After pretreatment with anthracyclines, a boy entered a second complete remission of an acute myeloid leukemia lasting already for 16 months following chemotherapy with Aclacinomycin A combined with Etoposide, Cytosine Arabinoside and Thioguanine. The newly developed Aclacinomycin A was well tolerated. Presumably there is no cross resistance between Aclacinomycin A and the anthracyclines, the latter being in use for the therapy of leukemias since some time.
