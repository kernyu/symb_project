A program of rotational anthelmintic treatments at eight-week intervals had failed to provide satisfactory equine strongyle control at a stable in southern USA. Anthelmintic resistance had rendered benzimidazoles ineffective, and intervals between treatments with other drugs were too great to prevent environmental contamination with ova. Ivermectin treatments at eight week intervals or pyrantel pamoate treatments at four week intervals successfully reduced egg counts for the majority of the summer grazing period. In southern temperate USA, translation of strongyle ova to larvae was most efficient during autumn and winter. Minimal larval translation occurred during summer when meteorological conditions limited pasture infectivity as effectively as anthelmintic treatments.
