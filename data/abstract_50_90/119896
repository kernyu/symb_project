We have isolated, after ethylmethanesulfonate mutagenesis, several chromosomal mutations causing resistance to tetracycline in Bacillus subtilis. These mutations fall into two classics, tetA and tetB. 30 S ribosomal protein S10 shows an altered mobility on two-dimensional acrylamide gels in cells bearing the former type of mutation. Ribosomes from these cells show elevated levels of resistance to tetracycline in vitro as measured by polyuridine dependent polyphenylalanine synthesis. The tetA locus maps adjacent to the tuf gene in the B. subtilis ribosomal protein gene cluster. Cells with the tetB mutation do not show any altered ribosomal protein, and their ribosomes are as sensitive, in vitro, to tetracycline as ribosomes isolated from wild type cells. The tetB mutation has been mapped proximal to cysA14.
