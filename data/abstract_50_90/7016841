Two novel linear deoxyribonucleic acid plasmids, pGKl1 and pGKl2, were isolated from the yeast Kluyveromyces lactis. K. lactis strains harboring the pGK1 plasmids killed a certain group of yeasts, including Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Saccharomyces italicus, Saccharomyces rouxii, K. lactis, Kluyveromyces thermotolerans, Kluyvermyces vanudenii, Torulopsis glabrata, Candida utilis, and Candida intermedia. In this experiment, the pGKl1 and pGKl2 plasmids were intergenerically transferred from a K. lactis killer strain into a non-killer (killer-sensitive) strain of S. cerevisiae by the use of a protoplast fusion technique. Both of the pGKl plasmids replicated autonomously and stably in the new host cells of S. cerevisiae and could coexist with the resident 2-micrometers deoxyribonucleic acid plasmid. The S. cerevisiae cells which accepted the pGKl plasmids expressed the same killer phenotype as that of the donor K. lactis killer and became resistant to the K. lactis killer. The pGKl plasmids existing in the S. cerevisiae cells were cured by treatment with ethidium bromide, and the killer and resistance characters were simultaneously lost. From there results, it was concluded that both the killer and the resistance genes are located on the pGKl plasmids.
