cis-Platinum diamminodichloride has been studied in combination with 2,2'-anhydro-1-beta-D-arabinofuranosyl-5-fluorocytosine on an every-4-day schedule in various lines of mouse leukemia. This combination is synergistic in leukemias L1210 and P388 and sublines made resistant to 5-fluorouracil or methotrexate. There is no cross-resistance between cis-platinum diamminodichloride and 2,2'-anhydro-1-beta-D-arabinofuranosyl-5-fluorocytosine, but the combination is no more effective against lines of leukemia made resistant to cis-platinum diamminodichloride or to 2,2'-anhydro-1-beta-D-arabinofuranosyl-5-fluorocytosine than either single active compound alone. Since these compounds have no cross-resistance, act by quite different mechanisms of action, and have different limiting toxicity, the combination is now being evaluated clinically.
