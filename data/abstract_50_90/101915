Strains of M. tuberculosis resistant to one or more of the antituberculous drugs have not been common in New Zealand in the past. There is however, a high incidence of drug resistant tuberculosis in Western Samoa, 50 percent of cultures tested showing drug resistance and half of these are resistant to two or more drugs. A change from the usual initial treatment is suggested for Samoan patients with tuberculosis in New Zealand.
