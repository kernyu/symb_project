A transfer function derepressed mutant of the F-like plasmid pAP18-1 (Tc, ColV) was induced with the help of N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrozoguanidine. The mutant plasmid pAP18-1drd belongs to the FVII incompatibility group of the F-like plasmids. The plasmid pAP18-1drd is characterized by the loss of the capacity for inhibiting the tra-genes functions of the Flac plasmid and is sensitive to the Tra-function inhibitors of the reference plasmids of the FinV and FinW groups.
