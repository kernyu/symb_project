The bactericidal activity of five antibiotics for Legionella micdadei was determined by the construction of time-kill curves. Erythromycin, rifampin, penicillin G, cephalothin, and gentamicin were bactericidal for L. micdadei at readily achievable concentrations. The minimal bactericidal concentrations, defined as those producing 99.9% killing within 24 h, were: erythromycin, 4.6; rifampin, 0.13; penicillin G, 0.25; cephalothin, 2.5; and gentamicin, 0.25 micrograms/ml. The ratios of the minimal bactericidal to minimal inhibitory concentrations for these antibiotics ranged from 1 to 8. Thus, the poor in vivo activity of beta-lactam and aminoglycoside antibiotics against L. micdadei cannot be ascribed to a lack of killing by these agents.
