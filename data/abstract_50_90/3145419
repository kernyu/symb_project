B. subtilis mutants resistant to novobiocin that were selected after treatment of the strain SB25 by nitrosoguanidine acquired the slow growth, increased UV-sensitivity, the low frequency of homologous recombination in transduction and transformation. The mutant strains are characterized by the low activity of the double stranded DNA-dependent ATP-ase peculiar for cells with impaired B-subunit of DNA-gyrase.
