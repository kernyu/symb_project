The mechanism of augmentation of tumor cell killing by immune effector cells and chemotherapeutic drugs was studied. The effect of treating tumor cells with various antineoplastic drugs on their sensitivity to murine natural cell-mediated cytotoxicity in vitro was investigated. Pretreatment with actinomycin D at nontoxic concentrations rendered L929 and WEHI-164 tumor cells more susceptible to killing by mouse spleen lymphocytes in a dose-dependent manner. Similarly, enhancement of L929 tumor cell killing by natural cell-mediated cytotoxicity was observed following treatment of the target cells with the topoisomerase II inhibitors, Adriamycin, amsacrine, bisantrene, etoposide, and teniposide, as well as with topoisomerase I inhibitor, camptothecin. In contrast, drugs which induce their cytotoxic effects by mechanisms that do not involve topoisomerase inhibition such as bleomycin, vinblastine, vincristine, and mitomycin C failed to exhibit synergism with natural cell-mediated cytotoxicity. However, moderate synergy was consistently observed with cis-platinum. The effector cells responsible for the cytotoxicity in the present system are natural cytotoxic cells since they kill WEHI-164 but not YAC cells, are resistant to treatment with anti-asialo-GM1 antibody, and their activity is abolished by anti-tumor necrosis factor antibodies. Indeed, tumor necrosis factor-mediated cytotoxicity of WEHI-164 or L929 was enhanced by treatment of the target cells with topoisomerase II inhibitors. Moreover, WEHI-164 cells selected for tumor necrosis factor resistance were resistant to natural cell-mediated cytotoxicity, and no synergy could be observed with topoisomerase inhibitors.
