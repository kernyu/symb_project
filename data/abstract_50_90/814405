The molecular properties of the P-group plasmids R26, R527 and R18-18- (a carbenicillin-sensitive derivative of R18) have been compared with those of RP1. R18-18 and RPI have a MW about 38 X 10(6) daltons, and R26 and R527 of 52 X 10(6) daltons (determined from contour lengths). All three plasmids have a bouyant density similar to that of RPI (1.719 g/cm3, 60% GN. From their molecular and phenotypic similarities, these plasmids probably represent two pairs of identical or closely similar elements. Resistant bacteria are not recovered following F116L-mediated transduction of R26 (or R527), and this correlates with the plasmids' larger size (phage genome=40 X 10(6) daltons). Fragments of R26 are, however, transduced and their resistance determinants may be "rescued" by recombination if the recipient harbours R1818. Such events are accompanied by an increase in the size of the recipient plasmid from 38 X 10(6) to 52 X 10(6) daltons following inheritance of the resistance determinants Sm Su Gm Hg, but not Cb. Thus, Sm Su Gm Hg are encoded in a DNA segment of MW about 14 X 10(6) daltons which apparently has no homologous region on R18-18. Since a piece of DNA of this MW also corresponds to the difference in size between R26 and R18-18, it is possible that the former is derived from an RPI-like element which has acquired these additional resistance determinants.
