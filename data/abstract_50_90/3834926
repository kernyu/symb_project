Mixtures of various combinations of Lysostaphin protoplasts and stable L-forms of Staphylococcus aureus, which have different markers for drug resistance, were treated with polyethylene glycol (PEG) to examine the development of doubly resistant fusion products (fusants). To recover doubly resistant colonies as L-forms, they were incubated in 4.5% NaCl-brain heart infusion (BHI) broth containing penicillin G (PCG) for enrichment culture and cultured in PCG-4.5% NaCl-BHI agar medium (method 1), while to recover doubly resistant fusants as L-forms and coccal forms, they were grown on reversion medium (R medium) which causes reversion of protoplasts or fusants to parent type cells, and then cultured on assay media, i.e., R medium, BHI agar medium or PCG-4.5% NaCl-BHI agar medium (method 2). Under both experimental conditions, doubly resistant fusants developed as L-form cells by PEG treatment of pairs of protoplasts carrying the chloramphenicol (CP)-resistance plasmid and L-forms having chromosomal resistance to streptomycin (SM). In the reverse combinations, i.e., protoplasts showing chromosomal SM-resistance and L-form cells carrying the CP-resistance plasmid, the first method gave no doubly resistant colonies. By the second method, without enrichment culture on R medium, the latter combination gave doubly resistant fusants as L-form, coccal-type and mixed-type colonial forms, while when the PEG-treated mixture was enriched on R medium, fusants were obtained exclusively as the coccal type on either R medium or BHI agar assay medium. Neither of the methods yielded colonies of doubly resistant fusants on PEG-treatment of pairs of protoplasts and L-forms both of which were chromosomal, but with different drug resistances. These results show that PEG-induced cell fusion between protoplasts and L-forms of S. aureus, unlike the fusion between protoplasts or between L-forms, resulted in transfer of the drug resistance controlled by the plasmid to the fusion products. The fusants obtained were L-forms in method 1, and coccal type in the method 2.
