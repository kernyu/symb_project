The case of a patient with severe anaerobic infection, a brain abscess, is presented. The causative organism was a penicillinase-producing, clindamycin-resistant strain of Bacteroides melaninogenicus. Treatment with adequate doses of penicillin G failed. Findings in this case suggest caution when basing therapy on the untested assumption that B. melaninogenicus is routinely susceptible to penicillin and clindamycin therapy.
