Endogenous prostaglandins (PGs) influence resistance of the gastric mucosa to injury, but the source of PGs is unknown. Using radioimmunoassay, we studied PG production by dispersed canine fundic mucosal cells. PGE2 production, stimulated by bradykinin, epidermal growth factor, zymosan, and calcium ionophore, was greater in the small-cell elutriator fraction (SCEF) than in the medium and large cell fractions, which contained mucous, chief, and parietal cells. Linear density gradients of SCEF cells revealed maximal PGE2 production in cells of light density. Mast, endocrine, and endothelial cells did not account for this PGE2 production. Macrophages, identified by uptake of acetylated-LDL, immunoreactivity with antibodies to the human Ia antigen, and phagocytosis of fluorescent latex particles, were enriched in the SCEF and correlated with PGE2 production in the density gradient. Magnetic separation of cells in the SCEF-ingesting iron particles enriched PGE2 production. Fractions enriched in endothelial cells present in intact capillary fragments, but depleted of macrophages, also produced PGE2. Regulation of PGE2 production differed among cell types. Fibroblasts were easily cultured from submucosa, but were not detected in the SCEF. We conclude that macrophages and capillary endothelial cells are major producers of PGE2 in the canine fundic mucosa.
