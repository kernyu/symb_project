Sisomicin, an aminoglycoside antibiotic, is especially effective against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Citrobacter, Serratia, indole-positive and indole-negative Proteus species, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella and Staphylococcus aureus. It has a bactericidal action. Although sisomicin is similar to the other aminoglycoside antibiotics, there is not complete cross-resistance to them. Our own pharmacokinetic investigations showed that a dose of 2--3 mg/kg body weight of sisomicin twice daily is necessary in the neonatal period. Infants should be given 2.5 mg/kg body weight three times daily, and school children 1.5--20 mg/kg body weight, likewise three times daily. Excretion of sisomicin in the urine is lower in children than in adults, amounting within 24 hours to only 10--20% in newborns, and 30--40% in school-children. Sisomicin induces excretion of some enzymes in higher quantities from the tubular part of the kidneys, especially alaninaminopeptidase. A report is given on 58 patients, especially newborns and prematures, who were treated for about seven days with sisomicin. The results obtained with a wide variety of infections (such as omphalitis, aspiration of amniotic fluid with broncho-pneumonia, phlegmons of the galea, and also pyelonephritis and mucoviscidosis with pulmonary complications) can be described as good, with a success rate of 85%. On only seven occasions were insignificant transitory side-effects, such as slight increase in transaminases, toxic-allergic exanthema and pain in the region in injection, observed.
