Chloramphenicol pretreatment of Escherichia coli increases resistance to UV, X-rays and H2O2 damage. Increased survival of UV-irradiated, infecting lambda phages is not observed. The hypothesis that enhanced survival of chloramphenicol-pretreated cells is due to the induction of plasmid "repairons" is questioned.
