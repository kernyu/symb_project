A series of 21 pediatric patients with ocular herpes simplex infections is reported. Two groups are presented: those with clinical primary herpes and those with documented recurrences. The corneal manifestations including clinical resistance to idoxuridine are presented. Stromal keratitis and visual loss were not marked in the primary group, but were difficult to prevent in those children with recurrences. The problems encountered in the overall management of children with herpetic keratitis are discussed.
