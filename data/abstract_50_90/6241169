The nucleotide sequence of the pSC101-encoded tetracycline repressor gene (tetR) was confirmed. The deduced amino acid sequence is compared to that of other repressor proteins. To overproduce the repressor protein, tetR was placed under the control of bacteriophage lambda promoter pL. Tet repressor protein was purified to homogeneity and shown to bind specifically to two tet operators and also to tetracycline (Tc). The inducer function of Tc is demonstrated by the loss of the specific binding between the tet operator DNA and the Tet repressor-Tc complex.
