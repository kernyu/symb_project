The in vitro susceptibility of 40 clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to 10 antipseudomonal antibiotics was determined. Of the strains examined, 100, 90, 85 and 80% were susceptible to netilmicin, amikacin, gentamicin and tobramycin, respectively; 93, 85 and 72% were susceptible to piperacillin, azlocillin and carbenicillin, respectively; and 93, 88 and 84% were susceptible to cefotaxime, moxalactam and cefsulodin, respectively. These data confirm that the newer antipseudomonal antimicrobial agents are more effective against Ps. aeruginosa than the older agents.
