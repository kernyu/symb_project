Sensitivity of 130 Proteus clinical strains was studied. Among beta-lactam antibiotics cefotaxime showed marked advantages with respect to various Proteus species. All the isolates of Proteus mirabilis were sensitive to cefuroxime. Cefamezin and cephapirin were inferior by their activity to cefotaxime and cefuroxime. They were characterized by close antibacterial activity and almost complete cross resistance. Ampicillin and carbenicillin proved to be the least efficient among the tested beta-lactam antibiotics. Isolates of Proteus vulgaris and Proteus penneri were more resistant to the penicillins and cephalosporins than the cultures of Proteus mirabilis. Sensitivity of separate Proteus species to gentamicin, tobramycin, sisomicin and amikacin was close. No cross resistance to the aminoglycosides was detected. Studies on the effect of different doses of the antibiotics revealed pronounced heterogeneity of Proteus by the feature of sensitivity to the tested antibiotics. The level of the heterogeneity was not the same for separate antibiotics. Cultures of Proteus mirabilis resistant to ampicillin, carbenicillin, cefamezin and cephapirin were more frequent in patients with urogenital infections as compared to patients with intestinal infections and suppurative-inflammatory processes of other localization.
