Antibiotic sensitivity and relation to typical staphylococcus bacteriophages of 1500 cultures of Staphylococcus and 100 cultures of Gram-negative bacteria, isolated from patients and carriers in clinics and subdivisions of the institute of traumatology and orthopaedics, have been studied. R-plasmids have been isolated from Gram-negative microorganisms, possessing plural resistance to antibiotics and relating to Enterobacteriaceae family. Failed to determine dependence between Staphylococcus cultures, isolated from patients and carriers in order to call them hospital-acquired ones. It has been noted predominance of the 11 phagocyte cultures in orthopaedic clinical picture of children and high percentage (55.1) of Staphylococcus carriage state in the clinical picture of acute traumata. Failed to detect hospital infection under the conditions of traumatologic hospital with application of common methods of bacteriologic investigations.
