A laboratory strain of Eimeria acervulina and 9 field isolates consisting principally of E. acervulina were tested for sensitivity to amprolium (125 p.p.m.) or dinitolmide (125 p.p.m.) in the food and for effects of the drugs on sporulation of oocysts. Judged by weight gains and lesion scores, medicaments were only partially effective against the 9 field isolates, but were highly effective against the laboratory strain. Oocysts were produced in all the infections but the percentage sporulation of oocysts from field isolates was much higher than sporulation of oocysts of the "drug sensitive' laboratory strain. These results show that coccidia that are resistant to either amprolium or dinitolmide are able to cause lesions in the presence of the drugs and the oocysts that are produced will sporulate normally.
