A series of clinical isolates of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) from two hospitals in China was examined. Fragment patterns obtained by digestion of total cellular DNA with restriction enzymes were used to characterize the isolates, in combination with phage-typing, antibiotic resistance profile, and plasmid profile. Digestion of total cellular DNA with restriction enzymes was most useful in discriminating between isolates and yielded additional information on the relatedness of non-identical isolates. In one hospital a single strain, resistant to a large number of antibiotics, had apparently become endemic. In the second hospital a number of distinct but related strains were present. The isolates were also related but not identical to the strain of MRSA endemic at the London Hospital.
