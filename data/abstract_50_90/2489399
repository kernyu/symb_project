573 strains of Klebsiella were isolated in Geneva (239 strains) and in Algiers (334 strains). The complete work with bacteriologic features (culture, biochemistry and antigenicity) will be published later. Two investigations took place in surgical cardio-vascular service in Geneva cantonal hospital and in Algiers hospitals: Pediatric (Beni-Messous) and intensive care service (Mustapha). High resistance percentages are found with Penicillins (greater than 60% by C.M.I.) in Geneva and Algiers. The strains are susceptible to aminoglycosides: in Algiers, 8.68% strains are resistant to Gentamicin and 5.99% to Tobramycin. In Geneva, all the strains are susceptible to Aminoglycosides. All the strains are susceptible to Trimethoprim and the Furans resistant strains are rare. The C.M.I. test is more precise than disc diffusion technique, especially for Penicillin and Furans. Cephalosporins and aminoglycosides are the best choice for treatment of Klebsiella infections.
