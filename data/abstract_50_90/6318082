We describe a bovine papillomavirus hybrid plasmid containing the neomycin resistance gene from Tn5 inserted into a mammalian cell transcriptional unit. This plasmid is maintained as a stable extrachromosomal element (20 to 100 copies per diploid genome) in mouse cells selected either for the transformed phenotype or for resistance to the aminoglycoside G418. Cells selected for G418 resistance initially display a flat, nontransformed phenotype before exhibiting the gross morphological characteristics of transformation. The delay in the appearance of the transformed phenotype indicated that some intracellular event or series of events subsequent to the establishment of transcriptionally active bovine papillomavirus 1 hybrid plasmid is required for the manifestation of the transformed phenotype.
