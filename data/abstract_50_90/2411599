The effects of apamin and quinine on glucose-induced electrical activity in pancreatic islets from ob/ob mice (Norwich colony) were compared. Apamin (40-400 nM) increased the duration of the bursts of electrical activity, whereas quinine (50-100 microM) affected only slightly the steady-state electrical response to glucose. This sensitivity to apamin and poor response to quinine contrast with the resistance to apamin and sensitivity to quinine previously reported for pancreatic islets from albino mice. The results give further support to the idea that pancreatic beta-cells from ob/ob mice have a modified Ca2+-activated K+ permeability.
