Since most recorded outbreaks of diarrhea in U.S. infants attributed to Escherichia coli occurred before currently available pathogenicity assays existed, we examined the characteristics of nonenterotoxigenic E. coli strains isolated from 50 outbreaks of diarrheal disease in U.S. infants between 1934 and 1987. We assayed the strains for enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) serotype, localized adherence (LA) and diffuse adherence to tissue cultures, the presence of EPEC adherence factor genes, Shiga-like (Vero) toxin production, and antimicrobial resistance. EPEC serotypes were identified in 28 outbreaks (56%). LA to HeLa cells was found in 23 outbreak strains and correlated 100% with the EPEC adherence factor probe. LA was observed in 21 of 28 EPEC and 2 of 22 non-EPEC strains; however, 5 of 23 strains that were LA positive for HeLa cells did not adhere to HEp-2 or HL cells. One strain was diffuse adherence positive, and none was Shiga-like toxin positive. Multiple resistance was common in EPEC (64%), LA-positive (74%), and LA-positive EPEC (76%) strains but not in others (10%). EPEC serotypes or LA was found in 60% (n = 30) of the outbreak strains. The remaining E. coli strains may represent nonpathogenic normal flora, as-yet-undefined pathogens, or pathogens that have lost virulence-associated traits during storage or subculturing.
