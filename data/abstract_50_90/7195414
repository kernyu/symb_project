Eighty-one women were randomly selected for treatment with nalidixic acid (1 g four times a day) or cephalexin (500 mg four times a day) as therapy for 131 episodes of bacteriuria localized using the antibody-coated bacteria (ACB) test. Bladder infections were treated for three days and renal infections for 14 days. Rates of cure were not significantly different between treatment groups in each drug regimen. However, significantly more relapses occurred in the patients with ACB-positive infections treated for 14 days with cephalexin than in those treated for 14 days with nalidixic acid. More early reinfections occurred in the cephalexin-treated group after both three and 14 days of therapy. Resistance to nalidixic acid developed in the infecting bacteria in the urine during therapy with nalidixic acid in 3% of women after three days and in 16% of women after 14 days. Simultaneous resistance appeared in the urine, periurethral area, and fecal flora of these patients.
