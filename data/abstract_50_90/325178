The development of resistance to amphotericin methyl ester, measured in terms of the amount of drug required to induce a standard rate of release of K+ from suspensions of washed organisms, has been followed in Candida albicans in starved cultures under controlled conditions of aeration, stirring and temperature. Resistance develops at a rate which increases with the rate of aeration, limited by the onset of damage due to turbulence. Resistance decreases rapidly if gassing with N2 is substituted for aeration, but sensitivity does not reach that of exponentially growing cells. Resumption of aeration is followed by a slow recovery of resistance. The addition of inhibitors of protein synthesis (trichodermin, verrucarin) or uncoupling agents (2,4-dinitrophenol, sodium azide) at the beginning of starvation results in an increased rate of development of resistance. Adding inhibitors at a later stage, when resistance has developed after 72 h aeration, does not affect the decrease in resistance produced by gassing with N2 but the presence of trichodermin or verrucarin delays the recovery of resistance o
