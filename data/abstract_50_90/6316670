A number of very different clinical pictures are summarized under the diagnosis, urinary tract infection (UTI). Therefore, the effectiveness of chemotherapy depends not only on the quality of the antibacterial substance, but also to a large extent on individual factors. For this reason, dividing UTI into three degrees of severity is proposed. This paper reports on the therapeutic results achieved with Cefotaxime on urological patients with ailments of 3rd degree severity (pyelonephritis and accompanying complications, such as obstruction, renal insufficiency, etc.). In a group of 153 patients, the infection causing organisms were no longer traceable when therapy was ended in 138 cases; in 15 cases, they could not be eliminated. The original bacteria reappeared during the follow-up period (4 weeks) in 20 cases, and in 49 cases, other, new species were cultivated.
