The authors report the results of a study with 100 strains of C. albicans and 50 strains of T. glabrata: the objectives of this experiment were to exhibit the primary and secondary resistance of the clinical isolates of fungi against flucytosine (5-FC) :another objective was to establish the concordance curves for 5-FC, by mean of MIC measurements and inhibition diameters by disk plates diffusion, determined simultaneously for the same strains. These curves make it possible subsequently to determine the MIC of 5-FC for the fungi strains by means of the inhibition zones. The last objective of this study was to compare the results achieved in different medium and growth conditions in order to choose the best possible technical conditions for MIC and antifungigramme determination.
