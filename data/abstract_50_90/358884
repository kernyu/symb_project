For a decade gentamicin has been used extensively because of its antimicrobial efficacy and the relatively low prevalence of clinical toxicity. Recently the more frequent appearance of resistant organisms, reports of increased nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity, and the development of newer aminoglycoside antibiotics have raised doubts about the continued use of this agent. This paper reassesses the role of gentamicin. It is clear that an appreciation of the pharmacokinetics and the clinical use of gentamicin as well as an understanding of the patterns of toxicity in animals and humans can lead to more efficient treatment with this antimicrobial agent. Despite ample competition from a number of newer aminoglycoside antibiotics, gentamicin will probably continue to be used widely in the near future.
