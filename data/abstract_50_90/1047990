A new nucleotidyltransferase has been obtained from clinical isolates of kanamycin, amikacin, tobramycin, neomycin and lividomycin resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus. The enzyme has been purified by affinity chromatography then characterized in a kinetic and physicochemical point of view. The results obtained support that the target of this enzyme is the 4'-hydroxyl group of a number of aminoglycosides. We propose to call it ANT(4')I.
