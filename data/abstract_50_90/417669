Integration of R-factor RP4 with the chromosome of E. coli was studied with the use of replication thermosensitive mutant pEG1 of this factor. It was found that the frequency of integration of factor pEG1 containing the ampicillin transposone Tn1 with the chromosome of bacteria JC411 carrying transposone Tn1 previously inserted into it was very high and markedly exceeded that of its insertion into the same chromosome but not carrying this transposone. The frequency of factor pEG1 insertion into the chromosome of bacteria JC 1553 rec A defective with respect to genetic recombination was less than 2.10(-5) and did not depend on the presence of transposone Tn1 in it. Probably, insertion of factor RP4 into the bacterial chromosome may be realized through the rec A-dependent process of recombination between transposone Tn1 previously translocated into the chromosome and the same transposone contained in R-factor.
