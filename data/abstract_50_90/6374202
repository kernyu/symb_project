Cefmetazole (CMZ) was administered to 102 infectious cases in the gynecoobstetric patients, and the basic and clinical studies have been performed. The main findings obtained in the present study are: Amont 78 cases of CMZ administration immediately after the initial infection (A group), 42 remarkably effective (53.8%), 36 effective (46.2%) cass were observed. When other drugs were not effective after the initial infection, CMZ was administered (B group) to 24 cases, and 15 remarkably effective (62.5%), 9 effective (37.5%) cases were observed. overall effectiveness in the A and B groups was 57 remarkably effective (55.9%) and 45 effective (44.1%) cases, which are very excellent clinical effects. Among 102 cases, the pathogenic bacteria were found in 55 cases, and 29 cases out of the 55 (52.7%) showed infections with E. coli and with other bacteria having mixed infections. The effect of CMZ to E. coli as judged by MIC was excellent, providing the excellent clinical results. E. coli and other Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria in the B group showed resistance to ABPC, CEX, CEZ and CET, and after administering CMZ, all cases showed disappearance of these bacteria, but the increase in the resistant bacteria for CEX, CET and CEZ was obviously shown. Subjective and objective adverse effects and clinical laboratory analysis showed no abnormal effect and values due to CMZ, and it was true of the of the case received 140 g in total of CMZ over 35 days, 4 g/day. It may be conducted from the above findings that CMZ is very effective and safe antibiotic agent in the infections in the gynecoobsterics .
