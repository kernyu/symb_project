In 11 patients in whom an antibiotic (Cefotaxim) had been applied preoperatively, the tissue concentration was determined in the vaginal mucosa where postoperative infections after gynaecological operations are most common. The tissue concentration is compared with the minimum inhibition concentration of the pathogens identified directly before the operation in the cervicovaginal flora. In the case of the aerobic pathogens--with the exception of Pseudomonas aeruginosa--the concentration is far in excess of the necessary MIC, whereas with the anaerobic pathogens the concentration is only partly greater than the MIC. Resistance exists against Bacteroides fragilis.
