Doxycycline in a single dose was found to be a valuable drug in the treatment of chloroquine-resistant falciparum malaria. It was less effective in a single daily dose of 4 mg/kg body-weight for four days, when it cured only five out of nine patients, while a dosage of 4 mg/kg body-weight for seven days cured 23 out of 26 patients.
