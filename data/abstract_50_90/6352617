In this study we have evaluated the efficacy and tolerance of ceftazidime used as the only antibiotic in the treatment of 19 critically ill patients, with serious infections caused by multiply resistant Gram-negative bacilli in an intensive care unit. The bacteria isolated showed a high susceptibility to ceftazidime and a moderate resistance to seven other antibiotics. Clinical improvement occurred in 42.1% of the patients treated. Tolerance, both local and general, to the drug was considered good. Ceftazidime appeared to be capable of replacing beta-lactam and aminoglycoside combinations in the treatment of serious infections caused by Gram-negative species in ICUs, but further experience is necessary.
