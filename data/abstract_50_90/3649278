Two surveys of antibiotic resistance in hospital pathogens are described. The first is a long-term, multi-center, laboratory based investigation in which antibiotic resistance data from laboratories with computerized reporting is collected. The difficulties of this type of investigation are discussed and some solutions suggested. In the second investigation reports of the isolation of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) were collected from microbiological laboratories on a nation-wide basis. The results were useful in monitoring the spread of the organism and in its control.
