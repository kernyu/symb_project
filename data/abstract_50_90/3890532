Ninety-eight adult patients with skin and soft tissue infections caused by a variety of bacterial pathogens were treated with imipenem/cilastatin (71), cefazolin (21), or moxalactam (six) at three medical centers. Favorable clinical responses were observed in 87 of the 90 evaluable cases (97 percent). Most etiologic pathogens were eradicated during treatment including five of seven which demonstrated in vitro resistance to the therapeutic agent. Strains that persisted during treatment were not associated with therapeutic failure except in one cefazolin-treated patient who was infected with Bacteroides fragilis. All three drugs were well tolerated and no specific patterns of adverse reactions were observed.
