Perspectives for use of four groups of immunoactive peptides in medico-biological investigations are considered. Glycopeptides, fragments of bacterial cell walls and their analogues, exhibited distinct modulating effect both on humoral and cell systems of immunity as well as the antitumoral action. Mechanisms of action of these substances are discussed. Synthesis and biological effect of thymus blood serum factor and of its simplified analogues are described. Perspectives for use of synthetic peptides in development of artificial vaccines are considered. Isolation of an antigenic determinant from surface protein of aphthous fever virus and its physico-chemical properties are described. Possible approach for control of the immunological status by means of neuropeptides was demonstrated using the delta sleep peptide. The delta sleep peptide and its cyclic analogue at microgram doses prevented the impairments caused by stress in the system of natural antitumoral resistance in mice.
