From September 14, 1981 to February 28, 1982, an epidemic of bullous impetigo caused by a penicillin/tetracycline resistant strain of Staphylococcus aureus, phage type 3A/3C, occurred in a newborn nursery in Louisville, Kentucky. Twenty of 1,181 (1.7%) infants at risk developed disease during the six-month epidemic period. Clinically all case-infants had bullous impetigo skin lesions. One infant developed staphylococcal septicemia. No infant died. An epidemiologic investigation identified a nurse as having significantly greater contact with case-infants than control-infants (p = 0.0013). She was also found to be a nasal carrier of the epidemic strain. Infection control measures appeared to decrease infant-to-infant transmission via the hands of non-colonized nurses, but did not affect transmission from the nurse carrying the epidemic strain to infants. No cases of bullous impetigo have occurred since this nurse was temporarily removed from the nursery for treatment.
