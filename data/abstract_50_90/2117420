The in vitro activity of trimethoprim plus dapsone against oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus was comparable to that of trimethoprim plus sulfamethoxazole. Because of its different pharmacologic properties, dapsone may be a useful agent in combination with trimethoprim for the treatment of patients colonized with oxacillin-resistant S. aureus.
