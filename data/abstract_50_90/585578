On the basis of bacteriology results of osteomyelitic patients of the recent 10 year period the authors examined the changes of antibiotic sensitivity/resistancy relations of strains of coagulase positive Staphylococcus aureus haemolyticus. Examination of 385 strains of Staphylococci showed that Staphylococci originating from osteomyelitic patients are more sensitive, respectively in a lesser degree resistant to antibiotics than those of miscellaneous origin. Concerning 8, in everyday practice most commonly used antibiotics, by means of regression trend line analysis, it has been stated that in the period of 1966-1975 years Staphylococci originating from osteomyelitic patients show a decreasing resistancy to antibiotics examined. The authors are of the opinion that in osteomyelitic patients the no satisfactory results and the high number of recurrent inflammations are not attributable to resistant strains of Staphylococci, but are due to many other biologic factors.
