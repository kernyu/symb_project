A low-molecular-weight bacteriocin produced by a Bacteroides fragilis strain inhibited ribonucleic acid polymerase activity in crude extracts of a susceptible B. fragilis indicator strain. A total of 10 rifampin-resistant mutants of the indicator strain were isolated. Nine of the rifampin-resistant mutants were resistant to the bacteriocin, and the other mutant was hypersusceptible. The rifampin- and bacteriocin-resistant mutants all adsorbed approximately the same amount of the bacteriocin as the indicator strain. Two of these rifampin- and bacteriocin-resistant mutants were investigated further, and the polymerase activity in crude extracts of the two mutants was not affected by either rifampin or the bacteriocin. The in vitro ribonucleic acid polymerase activity of the hypersusceptible strain was more susceptible to the bacteriocin than the parent indicator strain was. The bacteriocin-producing strain was susceptible to rifampin but was resistant to its own bacteriocin in vivo. The in vitro ribonucleic acid polymerase activity of the producer strain was only slightly affected by 64 arbitrary units of the bacteriocin. Increasing concentrations of the bacteriocin inhibited ribonucleic acid polymerase extracts of the producer strain.
