Bacteriological and clinical evaluations of BRL 25000 (1 part clavulanic acid plus 2 parts amoxicillin) granules in the pediatric field have been performed. The MICs of BRL 25000 against 25 clinically isolated strains of S. aureus, 40 E. coli, and 14 K. pneumoniae were compared with those of AMPC. Against beta-lactamase non-producing strains of S. aureus and E. coli, the MICs of both drugs were nearly equal, however, against beta-lactamase producing strains of these species and K. pneumoniae, BRL 25000 was superior to AMPC. The blood levels of AMPC and CVA after single oral administration of approximately 15 mg/kg of BRL 25000 granules to fasted children were studied in 3 subjects. The mean levels of AMPC and CVA peaked about 1 hour after administration at values of 11.40 and 5.49 micrograms/ml, respectively, with half-lives of 0.91 and 1.02 hours, and AUCs of 23.52 and 12.66 hr X micrograms/ml, respectively. The 6-hour urinary recovery of AMPC ranged from 30.59% to 52.03% and for CVA from 16.31% to 45.18%. There was no significant difference between the blood level of AMPC following single oral administration of approximately 10 mg/kg AMPC granules and that of AMPC following single oral administration of approximately 15 mg/kg BRL 25000 granules to the same children. Clinical evaluation of BRL 25000 granules administered orally 3-4 times a day at total daily doses of between 42.9-52.9 mg/kg resulted in improvement, judged excellent or good, in all 7 cases of tonsillitis and 2 cases of pyelonephritis. In particular, the clinical effect was excellent in the case of tonsillitis where a beta-lactamase producing H. influenzae was isolated. In the total 11 cases treated, including 2 cases of mycoplasmal pneumonia excluded from the clinical evaluation, 1 case of rash and eosinophilia was observed. No other adverse reactions or abnormal laboratory findings were observed. The taste and flavor of the drug were well accepted by the children. It was concluded that BRL 25000 granules are promising new drug which should be markedly useful in the treatment of infections in pediatric outpatients.
