Sterol content in haploid and diploid strains of yeast having mutations of resistance to nystatin were studied by UV spectrometry method. Heterozygous diploids carrying one or two nystatin resistance mutations have, as a rule, the sterol content of the wild type strains. Segregants of the same genotype demonstrate differences in sterol content. Double mutants nys1 nys2 and nys1 nys3 have UV spectra typical for single nys2 and nys3 mutants, respectively. Double mutants nys1 nysX are characterized by a "mixed" UV spectra of sterols.
