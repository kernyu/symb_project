A procedure for rapid mass assay of clinical strains of microorganisms based on DNA-DNA hybridization was developed. Epidemiology of the gentamicin resistance determinant cloned earlier from clinical strains of the same hospital was studied and its plasmid localization in representatives of various genera of Enterobacteriaceae was confirmed. The studies on dot-hybridization showed that in three antibiotic-producing organisms, i.e. S. fradiae 918 producing neomycin, M. purpurea 1535 producing gentamicin and S. rimosus 65 producing oxytetracycline there were DNA sequences homologous to those of the gentamicin resistance determinant cloned from the clinical isolates.
