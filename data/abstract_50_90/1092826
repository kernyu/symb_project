A nursery outbreak of gastroenteritis casued by Escherichia coli 0142/K86/H6 is described. Over a period of nine months, 59 epidemiologically linked cases of diarrhea occurred, including 21 intractable cases with four deaths. The epidemic strain, which was not agglutinated by commerical diagnostic antisera, was isolated from the hands of personnel in five instances directly incriminated hand carriage as the mode of spread. Acquisition of illness, which was especially high among low-birth-weight infants less than 17 days old, did not correlate with any treatment modality investigated and appeared to be related to a host factor. Noninvasive small intestinal colonization, production of enterotoxin, and multiple antibiotic resistance of the epidemic strain were demonstrated and helped to explain the intractability of clinical illness in many infants, despite intensive parenteral antibiotic therapy. Surveys of fecal coliforms on the hands of nursery personnel revealed no change in prevalence after introduction of a policy of "triple" handwashing with 3 percent hexachlorophene soap, but a significant decrease occurred during the use of disposable gloves. The frequent occurrence of E. coli 0142 in throat swabs of affected infants suggested that pharyngeal colonization may serve as an important diagnostic clue in E. coli diarrhea.
