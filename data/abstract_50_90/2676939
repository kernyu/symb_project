The in-vitro activity of FCE 22101 was compared with those of imipenem, aztreonam, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone and latamoxef against 225 Enterobacteriaceae (209 clinical isolates and 16 derivatives of Escherichia coli K12) chosen for their resistance (MIC greater than or equal to 8 mg/l) to third-generation cephalosporins. The beta-lactamases produced by the strains of Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Esch. coli were identified. The mean MICs of FCE 22101 were 2-8 mg/l for Ent. cloacae, Citrobacter freundii and Morganella morganii. For Ent. cloacae, the MICs were slightly higher for the cephalosporinase non overproducing (5.5-8 mg/l) than for the cephalosporinase overproducing (4.5 mg/l) strains. The mean MIC was 9 mg/l for Serratia spp. but for half of the strains the MICs were greater than or equal to 16 mg/l. The MICs of FCE 22101 were 0.5-1 mg/l for the resistant clinical isolates or isogenic derivatives of K. pneumoniae and Esch. coli producing extended broad-spectrum beta-lactamases (SHV-2, SHV-3 or CTX-1), whether measured in the presence of clavulanate or not, and against the sensitive controls. This showed that the compound was not affected by these new beta-lactamases. The MICs of imipenem, on the average four to five times lower than those of FCE 22101, were found to be very similar for resistant and sensitive strains. The MICs of aztreonam were high (32-128 mg/l) for C. freundii, K. oxytoca and cephalosporinase overproducing strains of Ent. cloacae. There was cross-resistance between the third-generation cephalosporins, but the MICs of latamoxef remained low (1 mg/l) against M. morganii, Klebsiella spp. and Esch. coli.
