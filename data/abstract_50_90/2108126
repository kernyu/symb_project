Chromosomal transformation of Agmenellum quadruplicatum PR-6 (= Synechococcus sp. strain 7002) was characterized for phenotypic expression, for exposure time to DNA, and for dependence on DNA concentration with regard to Rifr donor DNA. Exponentially growing cells of PR-6 were competent for chromosomal transformation. Competence decreased in cells in the stationary phase of growth or in cells deprived of a nitrogen source. Dark incubation of cells before exposure to donor DNA also decreased competence. Homologous Rifr and Strr DNA and heterologous Escherichia coli W3110 DNA were used in DNA-DNA competition studies, which clearly showed that DNA binding by PR-6 was nonspecific. DNA binding and uptake by PR-6 exhibited single-hit kinetics. Single-stranded DNA failed to transform competent cells of PR-6, and DNA eclipse was not observed, suggesting that double-stranded DNA was the substrate for the binding and uptake reactions during the transformation of PR-6. A significant improvement in transformation frequency was achieved by increasing the nitrate content of the culture medium and by lowering the temperature at which cells were exposed to donor DNA from 39 degrees C (the optimal temperature for growth) to 30 degrees C.
