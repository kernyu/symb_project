Bacteria isolated from the urine of 400 hospital inpatients and 483 outpatients were identified and the in vitro sensitivity of these organisms against 12 antibacterial agents currently used in the treatment of urinary tract infections was determined. There was little difference in the distribution of organisms between the two groups. Escherichia coli was predominant, accounting for 58% of the inpatients and 66% of the outpatients. Klebsiella was present in 15% of the inpatients as against 7% in the outpatients. Proteus mirabilis 9% inpatients and 8% outpatients and Enterococcus, 7% inpatients and 5% outpatients made up most of the remainder. The different organisms showed varying sensitivity patterns to the antibiotics tested. The commonly used antibiotics with the broadest spectrum were cephalexin and cotrimoxazole.
