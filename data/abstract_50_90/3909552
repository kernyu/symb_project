The sensitivity of Plasmodium falciparum to chloroquine was tested in Muheza, Pangani, Tanga and Korogwe districts in north-eastern Tanzania by applying both in vivo and in vitro tests in schoolchildren. A total dose of 25 mg chloroquine base/kg body-weight given over a period of three days (10 mg/kg on days 0 and one; and 5 mg/kg on day 2) failed to clear asexual parasites from the peripheral blood by day 7 in 12.5% of the children tested at Muheza, 5.9% at Pangani, 31.8% at Tanga, and 39.5% at Korogwe. In vitro micro tests were successfully carried out on 44 isolates at Muheza, 29 isolates at Pangani, 45 isolates at Tanga and 44 isolates at Korogwe. Schizont maturation at chloroquine concentrations of 1.14 mu mol/litre of blood and above, an indication of drug resistance, was observed in 20.5% of the isolates at Muheza, 41.4% at Pangani, 51.1% at Tanga and 45.5% at Korogwe. In vivo and in vitro results of the tests for resistance have been compared.
