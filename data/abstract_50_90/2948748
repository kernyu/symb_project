Either activated neutrophils (PMNs) or nanomole amounts of reagent hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) were found to cause catalase-reversible suppression of concanavalin A (Con A)-stimulated human lymphocyte proliferation. Suppression required PMN activation and occurred with PMN/lymphocyte ratios found in peripheral blood. Inhibition by reagent H2O2 occurred with 10-40 nmol H2O2/1 X 10(6) lymphocytes, a noncytolethal amount which is produced readily by PMA-activated PMNs. Lymphoblasts recovered from suppressed cultures were two- to fourfold less sensitive than control lymphoblasts to a second exposure to H2O2. These relatively H2O2-resistant lymphoblasts also scavenge H2O2 at higher rates than do control lymphoblasts. Progeny lymphocytes from suppressed cultures contain an unusually high percentage of T helper cells with a concomitant decrease in T suppressors. These studies demonstrate a potential immunoregulatory role for phagocyte-released oxidants, especially H2O2, and suggest a possible additional mechanism to explain the excess of T helpers observed in situations of chronic inflammation.
