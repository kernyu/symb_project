The presence of supercoiled deoxyribonucleic acid in the form of a relaxation complex is described for the antibiotic resistance plasmids R64, R28K, and R6K. The properties of these relaxation complexes indicate that they consist of a covalently closed circular deoxyribonucleic acid molecule associated with an activable, single strand-specific endonuclease.
