The treatment regimen for penicillin sensitive gonococcal conjunctivitis in an adult normally includes parenteral penicillin, frequent ocular irrigation, and topical ophthalmic gentamicin or tetracycline ointment. However, if a conjunctivitis is caused by a beta-lactamase producing microbe such as PPNG, then different antibiotics are required: e.g., spectinomycin or cefoxitin parenterally and topical chloramphenicol. Also, whereas urethritis is frequently treated with singular injections of penicillin or spectinomycin HCI (Trobicin), cases of PPNG ocular infections require a much longer course of treatment often involving seven days of intramuscular or intravenous antibiotics.
