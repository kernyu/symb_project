Apparent viscosity and mean channel hematocrits have been measured at various shear rates and feed hematocrits for red blood cell (RBC) suspensions flowing in two-dimensional channels. Three types of RBC were used in the suspensions : normal, partially hardened by heating at 50 degrees C and completely hardened by glutaraldehyde fixation. Channel height was varied from 20 to 200 mu and feed hematocrit from 5 to 55%. Measurements show that RBC deformability plays a dominant role in narrow channels and viscosity increases rapidly with decreasing cell deformability. Like in narrow tubes the apparent viscosity as well as the mean channel hematocrits decrease as the channel height is reduced. However the apparent viscosity in a channel remains slightly higher than the viscosity in a tube of diameter equal to the channel height. These results are consistent with the existence of a cell-depleted layer near the channel walls.
