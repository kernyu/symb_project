Fundamental and clinical studies in the pediatric field on 6059-S, a newly synthesized oxacephem antibiotics, were carried out, and following results were obtained. 1) MIC of 6059-S for K. oxytoca (40 strains), recently isolated from patients, were mostly more less than 0.2 mcg/ml, and that for H. influenzae was 0.05 mcg/ml, but that for non-group A-beta-Streptococcus (2 strains) were 12.5 mcg/ml. 2) In 9 infants, the serum concentration of 6059-S in a dose of 10 approximately 37.5 mg/kg/day with intravenous drip infusion method was measured. The peak serum concentration were 32.8 approximately 241 mcg/ml at end of injection, and serum concentration were 0.6 approximately 3.19 mcg/ml 7 hours after administration. The excretion rates in urine for 12 hours after administration were distributed between 55.8 approximately 89.6%. 3) Clinical evaluation of 6059-S was performed in evaluated 29 cases: 24 cases of respiratory tract infection, 2 cases of cervical lymphadenitis, 2 cases of urinary tract infection, 1 case of enteritis. The overall efficacy rate was 96.6%. 4) Side effects observed during this therapy were 1 case of diarrhea, 2 cases of adverse effect (eosinophilia, elevation of GOT, GPT).
