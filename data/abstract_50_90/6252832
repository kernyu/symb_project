The in vitro activities of two new beta-lactam antibiotics, cefotaxime and moxalactam (LY127935), were compared with those of cefamandole, cefoxitin, cefuroxime, and ampicillin against both beta-lactamase-producing and non-beta-lactamase-producing isolates of Haemophilus influenzae. Both cefotaxime and LY127935 were highly active against all isolates irrespective of beta-lactamase production.
