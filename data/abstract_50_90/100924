This report summarizes data on sixteen patients with enterococcal endocarditis treated with penicillin and streptomycin. The experience reported suggests that a four week period is adequate for routine therapy in these patients, as in other forms of streptococcal endocarditis. It provides an additional group of patients successfully treated with penicillin and streptomycin. Two relapses were encountered. One of these received inadequate daily doses of penicillin. The other patient was clearly a failure of penicillin and streptomycin, but the failure in this instance could not be attributed to foreshortened treatment (6 weeks) or to high level streptomycin resistance of the infecting strain of Enterococcus.
