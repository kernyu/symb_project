Induction of oxytetracycline resistance in a strain of Streptococcus lactis caused this organism to display reduced acid production, salt tolerance, pyruvate synthesis, growth at alkaline pH, and a loss in ability to produce ammonia from arginine. alpha-Ketoglutaric and oxaloacetic acids were found to accumulate in the growth medium of resistant cells, in contrast to none in the medium of susceptible cells. No free arginine could be detected in the intracellular fraction of resistant cells, but arginine was present in the intracellular fraction of susceptible cells and decreased in concentration upon the addition of oxytetracycline to the growth medium. Depressed acid production in milk by the oxytetracycline resistant strain is evidently a consequence of the inability of this organism to metabolize arginine effectively.
