The degree of the inoculum effect shown by the new beta-lactam antibiotics with Pseudomonas aeruginosa was investigated, and the antibiotics were divided into three groups based upon the observations. The group 1 antibiotics (cefotaxime, moxalactam, cefoperazone, azlocillin, piperacillin, and aztreonam) demonstrated a large inoculum effect, were poorly bactericidal, produced aberrant, elongated bacilli, and did not inhibit the increase in turbidity of high inocula during an 18-h incubation. The group 2 antibiotics (ceftazidime and ticarcillin) were slowly bactericidal, caused minimal formation of aberrant, elongated bacilli, and slowly decreased the turbidity of high inocula. The group 3 antibiotics (imipenem and gentamicin) were bactericidal, did not cause the formation of elongated bacilli, and decreased the turbidity of high inocula rapidly. Data are presented which suggest that the inoculum effect seen with the group 1 beta-lactam antibiotics is related to (i) the poor intrinsic antibactericidal activity of these antibiotics for P. aeruginosa at the inocula tested and (ii) failure of these antibiotics to inhibit the formation of aberrant and filamentous bacilli, which can result in increased bacterial mass and turbidity.
