Susceptibility of 34 recent clinical isolates of Staphylococcus saprophyticus to 16 commonly used antimicrobial agents was studied. Strains were uniformly resistant to nalidixic acid but tended to be sensitive to other agents, with occasional resistance noted to penicillin (3%), tetracycline (6%), sulfamethoxazole (6%), and erythromycin (15%).
