Proposed virulence factors, including multiple antibiotic resistance and slime-mediated adherence, among coagulase-negative staphylococci colonizing healthy individuals from two different study populations were examined. Resistance to methicillin was more commonly seen than initially anticipated. In addition, adherence characteristics, as quantitated by a microtiter plate method, were very similar to those of strains of coagulase-negative staphylococci causing nosocomial infections.
