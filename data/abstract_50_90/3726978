Twenty-five strains of enterobacteria, isolated from man in Peninsular Malaysia and consisting of seven Enterobacter spp., five Escherichia coli, five Salmonella spp., four Klebsiella spp., two Shigella spp., one Proteus sp. and and one Providencia sp., were tested for antibiotic resistance and conjugative R plasmids. They were all sensitive to nalidixic acid and resistant to at least three antibiotics. The number of resistances ranged from 3 to 11 antibiotics, including cefoperazone and sisomicin (two) newly released antibiotics), in addition to common drugs of current use. Of the 25 isolates, 19 (76%) conjugally transferred, at varied frequencies, at least two resistance determinants. Results from equilibrium density gradient centrifugation, agarose gel electrophoresis and transformation experiments provided proof that the transferable resistances were plasmid-mediated. Restriction endonuclease cleavage patterns showed that the plasmids from Proteus strain K005 and Providencia strain K001 may be identical.
