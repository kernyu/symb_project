Lysozyme production is a frequent property of staphylococcal strains isolated from various sources; all 503 tested strains of Staphylococcus aureus and 13 out of 35 strains of Staphylococcus epidermidis produced an enzyme lysing Micrococcus lysodeikticus as tested by a modified plate method. Lysozyme production by staphylococci is more frequent than the production of free coagulase, clumping factor, staphylokinase, Tween 80 lipase, and HgCl(2) resistance.
