Mycoplasmas were isolated from 11 (=#6,8%) of 161 cervix swabs from infertile mares. A total of 17 strains was isolated and characterized by indirect immunofluorescent test and metabolic inhibition test as Mycoplasma equigenitalium (11 strains), Mycoplasma subdolum (2 strains), Acholeplasma laidlawii (3 strains) and Acholeplasma equifetale (1 strain). In addition cervix swabs of the mares were investigated for bacteria. There was no specific correlation between presence of mycoplasmas and bacteria (table 1). In clinical investigations 5 of the 11 mares which harboured mycoplasmas showed a pneumovagina (table 1). The isolated mycoplasmas were tested for senstivity to antibiotics (table 2). All of the isolates were sensitive to Chloramphenicol (10 microgram), Tetracyclin (10 microgram), Tylosin (30 microgram) and Gentamycin (10 microgram) and resistant to Penicillin (6 IU) and Polmyxin B (300 IU). Against Erythromycin (15 microgram) all of the Acholeplasma-isolates were sensitive and all of the Mycoplasma-isolates resistant. Against Streptomycin (10 microgram) the two M. subdolum strains showed resistance, whereas M. equigenitalium and the Acholeplasma-isolates were sensitive. It is not yet possible to elucidate the significance of acholeplasmas and mycoplasmas in the genital organs of mares.
