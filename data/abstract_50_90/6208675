Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) strains (104) and 96 non-ETEC, all isolated from herds with piglet diarrhea in 1981 and 1982, were investigated with regard to antimicrobial drug resistance and colicinogeny. Eighty strains (77%) of the ETEC were drug resistant as compared to 66 strains (69%) of the non-ETEC. There were no significant differences between ETEC and non-ETEC in the frequencies of the drug resistance determinants investigated, except for tetracycline, to which 51 (49%) of the former and 30 (31%) of the latter strains were resistant (0.05 greater than P greater than 0.01). Of all strains 116 (58%) were resistant to streptomycin, 93 (47%) to sulphadimidin, 81 (41%) to tetracycline, 20 (10%) to trimethoprim, 14 (7%) to ampicillin, 11 (6%) to neomycin, 6 (3%) to chloramphenicol and none to nitrofurantoin. The frequencies of the different drug resistance determinants correlated well with the total amount of active substance of each drug used in farm animals in Sweden in 1981. Of the ETEC, 97 (93%) were colicinogenic whereas only 13 (14%) of the non-ETEC were colicinogenic.
