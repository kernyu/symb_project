The beta-lactam antibiotic susceptibility and beta-lactamase activity of 22 Yersinia kristensenii strains were determined in order to compare these properties with those reported for Y. enterocolitica. Carbenicillin, cephaloridine, cefoxitin and cefotaxime were the most active antimicrobial agents tested against Y. kristensenii. All strains were resistant to penicillin G, cephalothin, cephapirin and cephalexin. On the other hand, ampicillin and cefazolin activity could be considerated as intermediate. The influence of incubation temperature was also evaluated. All Y. kristensenii strains were more resistant at 22 degrees C than at 37 degrees C to beta-lactam antibiotics. Susceptibility to cefazolin was not affected by the incubation temperature. All Y. kristensenii strains produce beta-lactamase. The substrate profile of this enzyme is that of a cephalosporinase: its activity was highest on cephalothin, cephapirin, cephaloridine and cefazolin, while hydrolysis of ampicillin and carbenicillin was not detected. beta-Lactamase-resistant cefoxitin and cefotaxime were not hydrolysed. A correlation between beta-lactam antibiotic susceptibility and the hydrolysis rate of these antibiotics by beta-lactamase was observed, except for cephaloridine and cefazolin; these antibiotics were very good beta-lactamase substrates, but their MIC values were low.
