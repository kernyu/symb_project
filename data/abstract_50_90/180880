The effect of potassium benzylpenicillin, streptomycin sulfate and chlortetracycline on experimental gangrenous intoxication was studied. When the antibiotics were injected before intoxication, the albino mice resistance did not significantly change. When the antibiotics were injected immediately after the toxin administration, the resistance of the test animals markedly decreased.
