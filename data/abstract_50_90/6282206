The in vitro interaction of moxalactam and mecillinam against multi-drug-resistant gram-negative enteric bacilli was studied by checkerboard microdilution susceptibility tests and by killing curve kinetics. Against Enterobacteriaceae, the combination was unpredictable; the frequencies of synergy, indifference, and antagonism were 11, 76, and 13%, respectively. Against Pseudomonas sp., the two drugs were consistently indifferent. Overall, the combination of moxalactam and mecillinam was no more active than moxalactam alone.
