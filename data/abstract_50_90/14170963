A review is presented of some of the factors affecting the laboratory testing and practical applications of chemicals toxic to algae. The basic factor demonstrated is that the amount of chemical required to inhibit the growth of algae is dependent on the amount of algae present and not on the volume of water in which the algae are dispersed. It is shown how a chemical can be tested for algistatic or algicidal properties, thus enabling one to decide how best to apply a particular chemical. The selectivity of chemicals and the development of resistance in algae towards certain chemicals is demonstrated. Also, it is shown how certain algae can appear to be resistant to chemical treatments because of their growth habit or their production of extracellular products which affect the toxicity of added chemicals. With a better understanding of how various factors can influence the effectiveness of toxic chemicals, it is hoped that the selection of a chemical and method of application to a particular problem will be more successful.
