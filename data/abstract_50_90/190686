Campylobacteriosis, first described as a disease of cattle where it is very common and causes sterility or abortion, appears to occur in man mainly in predisposed subjects with debility or some constitutional defect. The nature of the background should make one consider Campylobacter as pathogenic. Antibiotic treatment is necessary in all cases in order to avoid decompensation of the congenital disease. It is probable that Campylobacter infections are more common than the small number of reported cases would suggest. In the absence of characteristic clinical criteria, diagnosis depends on the results of bacteriological investigations. This should take into consideration the slowness of growth of the germ in culture and its nutrient and respiratory requirements. The diagnosis is mainly presumptive in the light of the history and clinical findings in order to ensure optimal conditions for isolation of the germ.
