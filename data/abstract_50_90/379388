Two patients with purulent meningitis, of which causative organism was presumed to be E. coli, were treated with intravenous administration of cefmetazole, 300 approximately 400 mg/kg/day in 4 approximately 6 divided doses, and the following conclusions were obtained. 1) Clinical response was favorable and a complete cure was obtained without sequelae in both patients. There were no adverse reactions noted except for a mild and transient eosinophilia (12%) in one case. 2) Of two strains of E. coli recovered from CSF, one was sensitive to ampicillin, cefazolin and cefmetazole, among which cefmetazole had the highest bacterial activity. Although another strain was sensitive to cefmetazole, it showed resistance to cefazolin (greater than 12.5 microgram/ml) and to ampicillin (greater than 100 microgram/ml). 3) Concentrations of cefmetazole in CSF following 1 approximately 2 hours of its intravenous administration were either equal to or higher than those of ampicillin, which was given to the same patient for a short period of time. The concentrations in CSF were higher than 3.1 microgram/ml on each occasion except for in some specimens during the convalescent phase and exceeded well the MIC of the causative organism. 4) Based on the above results, cefmetazole is considered to be a potent antibiotic in the treatment of E. coli meningitis. Although further studies are needed as to the dosage, an intravenous administration at 4-hour interval appears to be warranted based on the studies that the half-life of the drug is short in CSF in animal experiments.
