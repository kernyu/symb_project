Experiments are carried out to elucidate the effect of the temperature and Moisture Regime on the resistance of broiler chickens to an experimental infection with coccidia and how far the prophylactic, anti-coccidial activity of coccidiostatics may be raised or reduced on this basis. During the experiment, prior to and after the infection of the chicken, investigations have been carried out on the morphological and biochemical composition of the blood, determining the contents of hemoglobin, total protein, vitamin A and vitamin E. It is established that the hematological and biochemical indices correlate with the course followed by the coccidiosis process and are related to the temperature and moisture regime in tending the broilers. If all other conditions are similar, the coccidiostatic activity of the Pankoksin Plus preparation is reduced both at lower temperatures and at higher degrees of infection with coccidia in broilers, and at a higher temperature and a lower relative, air moisture. The resistance of broiler chickens, grown at a temperature of 32 degrees C and air moisture of 70--75%, to coccidia infection is higher as compared with that of broiler chickens, kept at a higher temperature and a lower air moisture.
