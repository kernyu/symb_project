Detailed restriction enzyme maps of the antibiotic resistance plasmid pSa and of a chloramphenicol-sensitive spontaneous deletion mutant of pSa were constructed. The smaller plasmid contained one set of three restriction enzyme sites that appeared at both ends of the deleted region in the intact plasmid. The frequency of loss of chloramphenicol resistance was 1% after eight logs of growth and was dependent on the recA gene function of Escherichia coli. A previously published map lacks an 11-kilobase-pair SstII fragment present on this map.
