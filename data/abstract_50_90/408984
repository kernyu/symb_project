A model of antibiotic synergy based on a molecular mechanism of action which blocked sequential steps in a single metabolic pathway was tested. Twenty-five strains each of Pseudomonas, Klebsiella, and Serratia were tested in vitro against three different two drug combinations of vancomycin, carbenicillin, or cephalothin. Synergy was observed when vancomycin was combined with either carbenicillin or cephalothin against isolates of Pseudomonas or Serratia, whereas the combination of carbenicillin and cephalothin did not result in significant synergy against these isolates. The presence of synergy was not related to the sensitivity or resistance of the isolates to the drugs in the combination. Synergy was also observed with all three antibiotic combinations against Klebsiella isolates which may be related to enzyme inactivation by one of the drugs in the combination. These observations support the hypothetical model of antibiotic synergy based on sequential blocking of one biochemical pathway.
