Immune interferon, available at high specific activity through recombinant DNA technology, is known to activate macrophages to intra- and extracellular cytotoxicity. We now report that murine recombinant IFN-gamma activates macrophages to cytotoxicity also when applied in vivo. Furthermore, recombinant IFN-gamma can protect mice in vivo against the intracellular bacterial pathogen Listeria monocytogenes in a local as well as in a systemic infection model. The role of T lymphocyte-produced lymphokines in acquired resistance to facultative intracellular pathogens and their possible involvement in novel immunotherapy are discussed.
