When R factor 222 is transduced by bacteriophage P22 in Salmonella typhimurium, most recipient bacteria which adsorb transducing particles do not give rise to transductant clones (i.e., transduction is abortive); however the transduced drug-resistance genes can be rescued by recombination with the resistance-transfer factor or R factor carried by the recipient.
