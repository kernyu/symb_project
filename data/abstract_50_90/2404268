Septic shock is a difficult and complex condition that requires a thorough and thoughtful approach in all aspects of care. The most likely cause may become apparent by considering the clinical presentation of the patient and information from the history, physical examination, and appropriate laboratory tests. Appropriate antibiotic therapy should be initiated as soon as possible. Only an aggressive diagnostic and therapeutic approach can reduce the mortality and morbidity of this condition.
