To assess the possibility of a changing bacteriologic flora of hand infections and an alteration in antibiotic susceptibility, a 20-year review of acute hand infections was undertaken. Representative years were completely evaluated during the 20-year span. Over the course of the study Staphylococcus aureus infections decreased from 82% of cultures in 1960 to 34% in 1980. Pure Gram-positive cultures decreased from 85% in 1960 to 50% in 1980. Mixed Gram-positive and Gram-negative infections rose significantly from 8 to 39% over the 20-year study period. Susceptibility of Staphylococcus aureus to penicillin changed from 72% in 1960 to 9% in 1980. Susceptibility of Staphylococcus aureus to the penicillinase-resistant antibiotics and the cephalosporin antibiotics was at 81% and 97%, respectively, in 1980.
