Multi-drug resistance of Salmonella heidelberg was transmitted to normal intestinal flora (E. coli organisms were resistant to ampicillin, streptomycin, tetracycline, erythromycin, and oleandomycin. The donor strains of Salmonella heidelberg used in the experiment was a carrier of the following nine markers of resistance: ampicillin, streptomycin, chloramphenicol, kanamycin, neomycin, novobiocin, tetracycline, erythromycin, and oleandomycin. The donor strains of Salmonella heidelberg used in the experiment was a carrier of the following nine markers of resistance: ampicillin, streptomycin, chloramphenicol, kanamycin, neomycin, novobiocin, tetracycline, erythromycin, and oeandomycin, novobiocin, tetracycline, erythromycin, and oleandomycin. The resistance to drugs was transmitted with the oral administration of the donor strain at the preliminary neutralization of the action of hydrochloric acid in the stomah secretion through sodium bicarbonate (1 cm3 of a 10 per cent sol.) an hour prior to feeding the birds with Salmonella heidelberg (1 cm3 of 10(10). In other experiments carboneum tetrachloratum was injected at rates of 0.08 to 0.15 cm3 (acocrting with the body weight of birds) one day prior to infection, followed by the administration of 0.20 to 0.40 cm3 of a 2 per cent solution of omnopon. Escherichia coli organisms acquired new markers of resistance--to chloramphenicol, kanamycin, neomycin and novobiocin. The level of resistance proved equal with that to the donor strain. A total of 1.8 to 5.4 per cent of the intestinal E. coli investigated proved to be carriers of the indicated markers of resitance. Highest level in acquiring markers of multi-drug resistance (13 per cent) showed E. coli organisms isolated from the liver of birds injected additionally with C. tetrachloratum omnopon.
