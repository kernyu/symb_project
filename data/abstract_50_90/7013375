The study, carried out to localize the mutations which determine resistance to spectinomycin and neamin, has revealed that in Sh. Flexneri the genes of the str -- s area and located in the order similar to the order of their location in E. coli K12: spc A -- nea A -- str A -- nea B. Mutation in spc A gene was shown to have no influence on the capacity of the shigellae for causing keratoconjunctivitis, whereas nea A mutation resulted in the complete loss of virulence; in str A and nea B mutations the complete or partial loss of pathogenic properties was also observed.
