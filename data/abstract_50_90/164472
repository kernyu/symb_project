Nutrient transport rates and cyclic AMP levels have been implicated in the regulation of cell proliferation. In the present study, however, changes in intracellular cyclic AMP level in several lines of cultured cells (normal 3T3 and SV40 and polyomavirus-transformed 3T3 cells; 3T6, C6 GLIOMA, MOUSE L, and Novikoff rat hepatoma cells) by treatment with papaverine, prostaglandine E1 or isoproterenol did not correlate with the inhibition of the uridine, hypoxanthine or deoxyglucose transport rates by these chemicals. Transport inhibitions by above chemicals or Persantin or Cytochalasin B occurred in most cell lines in the absence of any measurable change in intracellular cyclic AMP concentration. Furthermore, treatment of several cell lines with 1 mM dibutyryl cyclic AMP had no immediate effect on the transport of uridine, thymidine or deoxyglucose, although the transport capacity of the cells for uridine and thymidine, but not that for deoxyglucose, decreased progressively with time of treatment. We also observed that the uridine transport system of all cell lines derived from 3T3 cells and the hypoxanthine transport system of L cells exhibited high degrees of resistance to inhibition by the various chemicals. On the other hand, deoxyglucose transport was inhibited to about the same extent by these chemicals in all the cell lines investigated.
