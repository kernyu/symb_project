Among 262 strains of Salmonella typhi from an epidemic outbreak of typhoid fever in Baden-Wurttemberg in 1974 2 strains were isolated which were tetracyclin resistant and showed no reactions with the Vi testphages T, D6 and VII whilst all other strains belonged to lysotype A, subtype Tananarive. It turned out that the Tc resistance in both strains was caused by a fi- R plasmid which could be transfered to other S. typhi strains, to E. coli K12, S. paratyphi B, S. java and S. typhi-murium as well as from Tc resistant E. coli K12 back to S. typhi. The Tc R plasmid introduced in S. typhi, lysotype A, caused specific restrictions of typing phages T, D6 and VII. Also, the transfer of the plasmids to strains of S. paratyphi B and S. typhi-murium resulted in restrictions of a number of typing phages. Both plasmids had identical patterns of restriction. In this pattern the Tc R plasmid differed from those described in the literature.
