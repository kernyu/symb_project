Methotrexate and folinic acid was administered as primary therapy in 185 patients with gestational trophoblastic disease between 1974 and 1984. Methotrexate and folinic acid induced complete remission in 147 (90.2%) of 163 patients with nonmetastatic disease and in 15 (68.2%) of 22 patients with low-risk metastatic disease. Sustained remission was achieved in 132 (81.5%) patients following only one course of chemotherapy. All patients with methotrexate resistance subsequently achieved remission with Actinomycin D or combination chemotherapy. Methotrexate when administered with folinic acid was associated with granulocytopenia, thrombocytopenia, and hepatotoxicity in 11 (5.9%), 3 (1.6%), and 26 (14.1%) patients, respectively. The human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) regression curve served as a reliable guide for the administration of chemotherapy and enabled the attainment of a high remission rate while limiting chemotherapy exposure. Methotrexate and folinic acid achieves an excellent therapeutic outcome with limited chemotherapy exposure and effectively limits systemic toxicity.
