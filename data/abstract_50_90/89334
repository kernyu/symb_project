The persistence of staphylococcal arthritis in a patient treated with nafcillin was attributed to intracellular sequestration of staphylococci. These intraphagocytic organisms were protected against bactericidal activity. The infection was cleared by rifampin--an agent which can penetrate leucocyte membranes. When clinical infections do not respond to seemingly adequate antimicrobial treatment, intracellular persistence of bacteria should be considered.
