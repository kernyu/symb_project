Plasmid R68.45 was transferred from Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO25 to the photosynthetic species Rhodopseudomonas gelatinosa and Rhodopseudomonas sphaeroides by selection for resistance to antibiotics. R. sphaeroides strains carrying the plasmid could transfer the plasmid and also chromosomal genes to other strains of R. sphaeroides.
