Natural isolates of Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Providencia stuartii were analysed to determine their plasmid content. This data allowed the identification of nosocomial strains of K. pneumoniae and P. stuartii and helped in the differentiation of epidemic strains of E. coli 0111 and S. typhimurium. Phenotypically similar isolates of S. typhimurium could be shown to be of independent origin using plasmid pattern analysis. The dissemination of a particular plasmid through different strains of S. typhimurium resulted in a simulation of a very widely distributed epidemic strain, because the plasmid interfered with the phage type of its host strain in addition to determining resistance properties. Plasmid pattern analysis disclosed two independently existing but interacting epidemic processes: a bacterial 'epidemic' strain may become disseminated over a large territory and may predominate there for a long time; a single plasmid, however, may also become distributed through many different bacterial strains and may spread over a large territory. Plasmid pattern analysis provides a valuable and universal epidemiological laboratory method.
