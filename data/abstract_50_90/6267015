Escherichia coli harboring mutant plasmids defective in maintenance stability (from the conjugative plasmid Rms201) showed a wide distribution of ampicillin resistance levels, as well as increased frequency of plasmid loss from the cell. The amounts of covalently closed circular deoxyribonucleic acid of mutant plasmid Rms268 and parental plasmid Rms201 per chromosome were 5.3 and 6.1%, respectively. The beta-lactamase activities of strains W3630(Rms268) and W3630(Rms201) were 0.56 and 0.44 U/mg of protein, respectively. Frequency of plasmid loss from W3630(Rms268) was about 0.8 to 1.2% per cell generation, 100 times more than that of the wild-type strain. Ampicillin resistance levels of the colonies harboring the mutant plasmid showed a wide distribution, from low (100 micrograms/ml) to high (1,600 micrograms/ml). A miniplasmid (pMS268) with a mass of 7 X 10(6) daltons and encoding ampicillin resistance was isolated from Rms268. Frequency of pMS268 loss from W3630(pMS268) was about 0.8 to 1.9% per cell generation. W3630(pMS268) also showed a wide range of distribution in the levels of ampicillin resistance. These results indicated that the copies of Rms268 in E. coli did not segregate evenly between daughter cells at cell division and that the gene involved was located on the miniplasmid.
