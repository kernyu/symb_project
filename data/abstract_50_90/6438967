Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes and S. schottmuelleri were isolated from the large intestine of a bacteriocarrier. E. coli and E. aerogenes strains proved to be resistant to a number of antibiotics. Plasmids were detected in DNA preparations obtained from E. coli strains. After the hybridization of these E. coli strains with E. coli C600 5K and S. schottmuelleri at 28 degrees C the transfer of resistance to kanamycin was found to occur. From some of the transconjugates thus obtained resistance to kanamycin was transferred to E. aerogenes. This resistance was found to be controlled by the plasmid with a molecular weight exceeding 2 Md. The fact that S. schottmuelleri in the carrier's body retained their sensitivity to antibiotics can be explained by the absence of the transfer of plasmid Kmr at a temperature exceeding 28 degrees C and by the existence of the infective agent in an ecological niche other than that of E. coli.
