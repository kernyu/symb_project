Amphotericin B (AMB)-5-fluorocytosine (5-FC) synergism has generally been observed in yeasts displaying 5-FC resistance. The present study was designed to assess activity of these drugs on yeasts showing susceptibility to 5-FC as well as AMB. Selected strains were incubated in a synthetic liquid medium with the test agents and viability or 14C-5-FC uptake was determined. Combinations of AMB and 5-FC continued to be inhibitory during the period that cultures treated with either drug alone were recovering from transient inhibition. In this sense, AMB + 5-FC exerted greater antifungal activity than either drug alone. However, combined activity did not involve AMB stimulation of 5-FC uptake by the organism. Results were indicative of sequential drug action.
