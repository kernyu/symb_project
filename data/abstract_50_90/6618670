A strain of a nutritionally deficient streptococcus was shown to undergo morphological aberrations according to pyridoxal concentrations in the growth medium. Filamentous rod-shaped cells, observed by electron microscopy, predominated in the presence of decreasing concentrations. Multiple invaginations in the outer cell wall suggested inhibition of binary fission. Penicillin antimicrobial studies performed in the presence of similar pyridoxal concentrations indicated a relationship between filamentous forms and penicillin susceptibility.
