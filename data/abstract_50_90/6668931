Twenty patients with suspected DDS resistance and repeated attacks of lepra reactions were selected for the study. Clofazimine was administered in different doses over a period of 12 months. Elevated levels of transaminases and Alkaline phosphatase prior therapy attained values to near normalcy. Progressive fall in serum Bilirubin and Proteins with normal A/G ratio at the end of therapy was also observed. Clofazimine by its anti-inflammatory and antibacterial action could inhibit the process of liver damage and happened to have minimal deleterious effect on liver by studying the liver function tests.
