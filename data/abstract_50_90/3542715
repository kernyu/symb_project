To generate polylinker sequences which can be transferred together with an adjacent selectable marker, two plasmids (pWW-84 and pWW-97) were constructed which contain a kanamycin-resistance gene (KmR) flanked by various restriction sites. From these plasmids KmR-cartridges can be obtained as EcoRI, BamHI, SalI, AccI or HincII fragments for insertion into the appropriate restriction site of any plasmid. The following restriction sites can be introduced with these cartridges: BamHI, SalI (AccI, HincII), EcoRI, SacI, SphI and KpnI (Asp718) all adjacent to KmR, XhoI and HindIII, both within KmR. If desired, KmR can be removed by PstI digestion and religation, creating a single PstI site and leaving all adjacent sites intact.
