The influence of interlok, biotop and remantadine on the functional activity of monocytes was determined with the use of the NBT test permitting the quantitative evaluation of this characteristic. In this study interlok was found to give promising results in the treatment of acute viral hepatitis, due both to its antiviral action and to the stimulation of the functional activity of monocytes. biotop proved to render a sharply pronounced stimulating effect on the functional activity of monocytes, thus enhancing antiviral resistance. Remantadine suppressed the functional activity of monocytes and increased their lesion by the virus, thus creating favorable conditions for virus persistence in monocytes.
