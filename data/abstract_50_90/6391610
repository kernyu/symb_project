A retrospective chart review was conducted of 5418 culture and sensitivity reports from 93 paediatric burn patients to determine profiles of wound flora and invasive organisms, trend analysis and patterns of antibiotic resistance. Coagulase-positive Staphylococcus was the predominant burn wound pathogenic isolate and the predominant invasive organism for burns less than 60 per cent BSA. Pseudomonads were the predominant invasive organism for burn wounds greater than or equal to 60 per cent BSA. Only 7 per cent of all pathogenic isolates were fungi. A significant association was demonstrated between increasing burn size and an increasing incidence of Gram-negative and invasive organisms. Silver sulphadiazine remains a very effective topical agent for the control of bacterial and fungal growth in burn wounds after 10 years of intensive use in this burn unit. Pseudomonad isolates were routinely multi-drug resistant. Pseudomonad isolates from wounds treated topically with a silver sulphadiazine-cerium nitrate mixture were frequently resistant to aminoglycosides, colistin and carbenicillin. It is concluded from this review that severe restrictions on antibiotic usage within burn units, and strict internal environmental control within burn units may help to decrease the incidence of nosocomial resistant strains and cross infection. Regular monitoring of burn wound flora, and the protocol for wound care used in treating these patients have been effective in preventing septic episodes and death due to sepsis.
