Retroviral gene expression is inhibited in embryonal carcinoma (EC) cells. We have constructed a recombinant retroviral vector that is capable of expressing the neomycin-resistance (neo) gene in EC cells. The critical modification that permits expression of the neo gene is the insertion of a composite simian virus 40 early gene-herpes simplex virus type 1 thymidine kinase gene (SVtk) promoter 3' to the viral first intron and 5' to the neo gene. When the SVtk promoter is deleted, the recombinant retrovirus is either unable or extremely inefficient at expressing the neo gene in EC cells.
