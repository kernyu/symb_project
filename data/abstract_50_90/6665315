It was found that surprisingly low doses of four babesicides were effective against Babesia divergens in gerbils and it was concluded that this was due to the involvement of host resistance, which may be of a non-specific nature. The efficacy of the drugs relative to each other was the same in gerbils as in cattle and this host-parasite system is evidently more suitable for the screening of babesicides than are other rodent babesia systems. The prophylactic dose of imidocarb dipropionate required to provide a similar degree of protection in gerbils as in cattle was found to be much higher and was very close to toxic levels. Challenge infections resulted in sterile immunity. Acute babesiosis in gerbils could be cured with all four drugs if parasitaemias were below approximately 45 per cent and packed cell volumes above 18 per cent at treatment.
