The dynamics of sensitivity to penicillin of staphylococcal populations in purulent inflammatory foci of patients treated and not treated with antibiotics was estimated according to 4 indices. No reliable differences in the dynamics of sensitivity to penicillin were found in 2 groups of the patients, when estimation was performed with respect to the frequency of the penicillin resistant or penicillin sensitive staphylococci and detection of the penicillin resistant staphylococci by direct inoculation of the focal excretion to the medium with penicillin. A reliable increase in the percentage of the penicillin resistant staphylococci in the microbial population was observed only in the patients treated with penicillin.
