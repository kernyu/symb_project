In order to obtain a better understanding of the control mechanisms involved in asparagine-linked glycosylation, we developed conditions under which the glucosidase I and II inhibitor castanospermine and the mannosidase II inhibitor swainsonine were toxic to Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells when cultured in the presence of low concentrations of the plant lectin concanavalin A. Cells resistant to castanospermine (CsR cells) and swainsonine (SwR cells) were obtained by gradual stepwise selections. These cells had normal levels of glucosidase II and mannosidase II and appeared to have no major structural alterations in their surface asparagine-linked oligosaccharides. Interestingly, the CsR and SwR cells were each pleiotropically resistant to castanospermine, swainsonine, and deoxymannojirimycin, an inhibitor of mannosidase I. This resistance was not due to the multiple-drug resistance phenomenon. Both the CsR and SwR cell populations synthesized Man5GlcNAc2 in place of Glc3Man9GlcNAc2 as the major dolichol-linked oligosaccharide. This defect was not due to a loss of mannosylphosphoryldolichol synthetase. Furthermore, the Man5GlcNAc2 oligosaccharide was transferred to protein and appeared to give rise to normal mature oligosaccharides. Thus, the CsR and SwR cells achieved resistance to castanospermine, swainsonine, and deoxymannojirimycin by synthesizing altered dolichol-linked oligosaccharides that reduced or eliminated the requirements for glucosidases I and II and mannosidases I and II during the production of normal asparagine-linked oligosaccharides. We propose that this phenotype be termed PIR, for processing inhibitor resistance.
