Growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 2 atmospheres absolute of 100% oxygen at 37 degrees C produced two types of abnormal colonies--stunted, rough colonies, termed dwarfs, and large, domed, mucoid colonies, termed giants. The occurrence of these variants depended upon the partial pressure of oxygen and the inoculum size. Subculture of dwarf or giant colonies produced a mixture of both colony types after incubation in hyperbaric oxygen, and colonies of normal appearance after incubation in air. Electron micrographs of ultrathin sections showed that cells from dwarf colonies had a more clearly defined envelope region than cells from normal colonies. Giant colony and normal colony-derived cells were of similar appearance. Whole cells from giant colonies contained more carbohydrate, readily extractable lipid, neutral lipid and free fatty acid than cells from normal colonies; the two cell types showed similar contents of 2-keto,3-deoxyoctonic acid and total phospholipid, but different proportions of individual phospholipids. Cells from dwarf, giant and normal (air-grown) colonies were incubated in air on nutrient agar containing either polymyxin, tetracycline or phenoxyethanol. Relative to cells from normal colonies, cells from dwarf colonies showed enhanced resistance to all three agents and cells from giant colonies showed enhanced resistance to polymyxin and tetracycline only. The resistance of cells from variant colonies was lost following a single subculture in air in the absence of antibacterial agents. It was concluded that the envelopes of cells from dwarf and giant colonies differed both from each other and from those of normal cells. These differences, and the formation of variant colonies, appeared to result from bacterial adaptation to hyperbaric oxygen rather than from mutation.
