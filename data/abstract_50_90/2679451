Unknown in 1980, suspected in 1983 and scarcely present in 1984-85, Plasmodium falciparum resistance to chloroquine as studied in vivo in schoolchildren in Gabon, has strongly developed in 4 years time. In 1987-88, administration of 25 mg/kg of chloroquine leaves one strain out of four with a parasitic load greater than 10/1.000 red blood cells examined by thick drop technique. The present, unfortunately provisional attitude tends to maintain chloroquine at efficient doses for as long as the resistant strains are ethically and practically controllable. The dispersion without strict control of new and for the time being very efficient drugs might rapidly give rise to a polychemoresistance which would leave us without defence.
