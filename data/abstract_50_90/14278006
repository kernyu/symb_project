In view of the fact that diaphenylsulfone has been shown to have low schizontocidal activity against Plasmodium gallinaceum and to lead to resistance in strains of P. cynomolgi, investigations were undertaken into the joint action of diaphenylsulfone and pyrimethamine against P. gallinaceum in chicks and P. cynomolgi bastianellii in monkeys. These drugs were assayed separately and in various combinations. It was found that at certain dose levels combination of the two drugs led to potentiation of their plasmocidal activity. On the other hand, this synergistic effect was not noted with combinations containing lower dosages of either drug; with these, a simple additive effect occurred. The authors suggest that the two drugs probably act on the same metabolic pathway but that their points of attack may be different. They note also that there was a difference in the response of P. gallinaceum in chicks and of P. cynomolgi bastianellii in monkeys to the combined use of the two drugs.
