Twenty-four children, ten of whom had an infection due to ticarcillin-resistant, Timentin-sensitive bacteria, were treated with Timentin. A full clinical success was obtained in sixteen cases (13 pyelonephritis, nine of them due to ticarcillin-resistant, Timentin-sensitive Escherichia coli, two neonatal infections and one pneumonia). Four children were improved (1 bronchiectasis, 3 leukaemias), three were unassessable and one failure occurred with a staphylococcal urinary tract infection. A pharmacokinetic study was performed in three newborns (under three months) and ten children (mean age 3 years). Timentin was administered as four daily 30-min iv infusions. The mean dosage used in patients under three months was 225 mg/kg/d ticarcillin and 9 mg/kg/d clavulanic acid. In infants older than three months of age the mean dosage was 250 mg/kg/d ticarcillin and 16 mg/kg/d clavulanic acid. The pharmacokinetic results demonstrated similar serum concentrations of ticarcillin to those in earlier studies, and serum concentrations of clavulanic acid of 3.1 +/- 0.63 mg/l and 2.18 +/- 0.17 mg/l at 1 h and 2 h respectively after infusion in newborns. For children, at the same times, the serum levels were respectively 2.3 +/- 0.9 mg/l and 1.4 +/- 0.9 mg/l. The peak serum concentrations of clavulanic acid were the same in the two groups of dosages (4.7 mg/l), but the half-lives of clavulanic acid were 1.1 h in children older than three months and 1.8 h in infants younger than 3 months. The tolerance was good. Timentin may be useful as a first line antibiotic in infections in hospitalized children in the dosage described, as three or four injections daily, according to the age and the severity of the disease.
