Miscellaneous Staphylococcus aureus populations were tested with seven commercialized cephalosporins. The strains were divided in five groups according to the following criteria: penicillinase production or not: sensitivity to methicillin and cephalosporins; RB type resistance to methicillin; RH and RO type resistance to every beta-lactamine (according to Chabbert and Baudens). For each cephalosporin studied, the population cell analysis performed with these different groups showed the constant heterogeneous arrangement of the individual MIC. However, whatever the staphylococcus group, cephaloridine remains the antibiotic that inhibits the largest number of cells at lower concentration than other cephalosporins. In vitro results were compared with pharmacokinetic data of the different cephalosporins.
