The in vitro activity of cefbuperazone was compared with that of cefoxitin, moxalactam, and piperacillin against 305 strains of anaerobic bacteria. Piperacillin was the most active overall, inhibiting 97% of all anaerobes tested at 128 micrograms/ml. Cefbuperazone had poor activity against the Bacteroides fragilis group and Clostridium difficile (43 and 0% susceptible, respectively) but good activity (90.5%) against all other anaerobic bacterial species tested.
