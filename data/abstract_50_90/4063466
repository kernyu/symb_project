We have reported a case of septicaemia caused by "Corynebacterium of group J. K." in a patient with acute myeloblastic leukaemia. Recent studies by Riley (1978) have shown that the corynebacteria, saprophytes of the skin and mucosa have a resistance to common antibiotics. Corynebacteria that are only sensitive to virginiamycin and vancomycin are a potential danger for immunosuppressed patients and patients with artificial heart valves, the appropriate choice of antibiotic can be difficult in these patients.
