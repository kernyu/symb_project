Subcutaneous injections of caffeine, calcium ionophore X537A or cAMP did not affect the changes of input resistance (R0) and time constant (T) of membrane caused by denervation of the frog m. sartorius but prevented the MP decrease and ACh sensitivity spread. Injections of cGMP did not affect the denervation changes of R0 and MP but increased the ACh sensitivity. The neurotrophic control of frog muscle membrane properties seems to depend on calcium and involve the cyclic nucleotides system.
