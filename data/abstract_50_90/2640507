Staphylococcus aureus is reported to be the most common organism to cause peritonitis in continuous ambulatorial peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). Staphylococcal nasal carriage is frequently seen in these patients. The authors studied the sensitivity of S. aureus strains isolated from CAPD patients and some close family contacts. Susceptibility of 147 strains of S. aureus to 23 antimicrobial agents were determined based on 348 samples. All strains tested were susceptible to vancomycin. Penicillin resistance was found in nearly all strains. Resistance to rifampicin was seen in just 5% of the strains. A high rate of resistance to ampicillin, amoxicillin, tetracycline, and also to cotrimoxazole, gentamicin, and tobramycin were observed. Cephalosporins and some aminoglycosides (amicacin and netilmicin) have a good in vitro bactericidal activity anti-S. aureus. Knowledge of the susceptibility profile of bacteria frequently isolated at a given hospital ward will provide the basis for a more effective empirical antibiotic treatment in such ward.
