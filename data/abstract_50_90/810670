Methods for the serological and bacteriological investigation of mycoplasma and the clinical symptoms in infections with identified mycoplasma are described. The significance of mycoplasma in inflammatory diseases of the respiratory tract is a matter for discussion according to present knowledge. The pathogenicity of Mycoplasma pneumoniae in atypical pneumonias can be considered confirmed according to the availabile literature; its importance for other inflammatory diseases of the respiratory tract, particularly for chronic bronchitis, is not yet sufficiently clear. Further specific studies are necessary with a selected, reliable series of patients under carefully defined precautions.
