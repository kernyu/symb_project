Out of the 2,527 strains typed in 1976, 1977, 1978 and 1979, 226 strains (8.94%) were lysed by phages 94, 96 or 94 + 96. The two phages lyse together 83.17% of strains, whilst phage 94 alone lyses only 3.96% and phage 96 alone 12.87%. 94/96 strains have the S. aureus species antigens, particularly that of biotype A (human) at levels similar to those previously described: Protein A 96%, beta Ribitol teichoic acid (93%). Very characteristic is the presence in these strains of type antigens c1 (89%) and sigma (92%), which are significantly unusual or absent in the strains of other phages types. 94-96 complex strains are sensitive to antibiotics except resistance to Penicillin G (95%), Tetracycline (48%), Doxycycline (25%). Relation between lysis by phages 94-96 and presence of antigens c1 and sigma is discussed.
