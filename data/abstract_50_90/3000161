Various dosing strategies to determine therapeutic effects of nitroglycerin (NTG) preparations are reviewed. The importance of individual patient titration in establishing an effective NTG dosage is emphasized by reviewing a nitroglycerin ointment study and a crossover study. Studies reporting the development of hemodynamic attenuation ("tolerance") with longterm nitrate therapy are also discussed. The results of these and other studies suggest that the magnitude of the hemodynamic response to NTG or isosorbide dinitrate diminishes over time, with acute or first-dose effects far exceeding those obtained during long-term therapy. However, patients on long-term therapy continue to respond to sublingual NTG, which suggests that this phenomenon is not true NTG tolerance. The effect of a nitrate-free interval as a mechanism for avoiding hemodynamic attenuation of NTG therapy is reviewed. The results of 4 studies discussed found that intermittent nitrate protocols were not associated with the attenuated hemodynamic effect observed during chronic therapy. Two possible mechanisms for the vasodilatory effects of nitroglycerin are discussed. The first relates to the production of cyclic guanosine monophosphate in the smooth muscle cells of arteries and veins; the second to the synthesis of prostaglandin I2 by vascular endothelial cells. A mechanism by which nitrate receptors could be manipulated to increase vascular responsiveness is theorized, as well as a means by which a nitrate-free interval might avoid the development of hemodynamic attenuation in terms of cellular mechanisms and receptors.
