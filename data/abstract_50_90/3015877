The Bacteroides drug resistance plasmid pCP1 encodes clindamycin resistance (Clr) and a cryptic tetracycline resistance (Tcr) determinant that is expressed in Escherichia coli cells grown aerobically, but not anaerobically, and is not expressed phenotypically in Bacteroides spp. Localization of genetic functions on pCP1 was facilitated by the construction of hybrid shuttle plasmids containing portions of pCP1 ligated to pDG5, a pBR322 derivative carrying the RK2 transfer origin. pDP1 delta 4 is a BglII deletion derivative of pCP1 linked to pDG5 and can be maintained in both E. coli and Bacteroides fragilis. By using Tn5 mutagenesis and subcloning, we localized the Clr and Tcr regions on the EcoRI B fragment between the 1.2-kilobase direct repeats of pCP1. The Clr and Tcr determinants are distinct and appear to be transcribed separately. Control of the Tcr phenotype is unusual in that expression is constitutive and is enhanced by a region encompassing the adjacent direct repeat. In addition, a region of pCP1 required for replication in Bacteroides spp. has been identified in the neighboring EcoRI A fragment.
