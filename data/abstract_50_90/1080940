The influence of homologous n-alkyl alcohols (C2, C4, C8) on the membrane action potentials of isolated frog skeletal muscle fibres has been studied using the sucrose-gap method. 1. The alcanols tested effect a decrease in the height of the action potential and prolong the recovery phase of the spike. The threshold for excitation is increased. 2. The amplitude of these alcanol induced effects depends on the concentration of the alcanols, on the time of exposure and on the length of the hydrocarbon chain of the alcanols. 3. Membrane resistance, membrane resting potential, and membrane capacity are not affected by concentrations of alcanols which effect changes in the membrane action potential. 4. The findings are discussed in regard to alterations induced by alcanols in the conductance changes associated with a membrane action potential.
