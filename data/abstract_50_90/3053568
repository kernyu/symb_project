Macrolides are active against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Legionella spp. and Mycoplasma pneumoniae, the main causes of community-acquired pneumonia They may therefore be used for the empirical treatment of community-acquired pneumonia, although emergent resistance in Str. pneumoniae limits their use in some parts of the world. In patients with bronchitis the use of macrolides reduces the severity and duration of symptoms. Macrolides have also been used successfully in the treatment of otitis media and sinusitis; combination with sulphonamides may be desirable. They may be effective in eradicating the carrier state of Str. pyogenes, Bordetella pertussis, Corynebacterium diptheriae, and Neisseria meningitidis. Macrolides provide alternative therapy for the prophylaxis of recurrent acute rheumatic fever and of infective endocarditis after dental treatment. The cure rate with macrolides of streptococcal skin infections and of minor staphylococcal infections is equal to that achieved with penicillins. In diarrhoea due to Campylobacter jejuni, the administration of macrolides shortens the duration of the faecal excretion of organisms and may give clinical improvement in severe disease. Macrolides are the drugs of choice for infections due to Chlamydia trachomatis in pregnancy and for Haemophilus ducreyi infections. They are effective alternative therapy to benzylpenicillin for the treatment of N. gonorrhoeae and Treponema pallidum infections.
