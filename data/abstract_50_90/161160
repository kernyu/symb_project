For men with urethral discharge, a simple gram stained smear is 98% sensitive and over 99% specific in detecting gonococcal infection when compared to a single Thayer-Martin culture. The smear is less than 50% sensitive in asymptomatic urethritis. Neither Fluorescent antibody nor various serologic tests offer any diagnostic advantages over smears and/or cultures and they are not cost-effective. Treatment of gonococcal urethritis may be successfully accomplished with a variety of antibiotic regimens. Tetracycline hydrochloride (500 mg four times a day for 5 days) is highly effective, inexpensive, and is active against Chlamydia trachomatis; post gonococcal urethritis (PGU) is therefore uncommon. Aqueous Procaine Penicillin G (4.8 million units IM with 1 g of probenecid) has become the standard in the United States but suffers from higher cost, the need for refrigeration, occasional alarming toxic procaine reactions, and a high incidence of PGU. Spectinomycin 2 g IM remains expensive but is the regimen of choice for treatment failures and for Neisseria gonorrhoeae that produce penicillinase (PPNG). Other antibiotics active against PPNG are cotrimoxozole, cefoxitin, and cefuroxime. PNNG have now been reported from 27 countries throughout the world, but have attained significant prevalence in only a few areas of East Asia and West Africa. Because gonococcal patterns of antibiotic resistance are constantly changing, each region of the world needs to monitor treatment results and maintain some surveillance over sensitivity to antibiotics.
