In vitro activities of antibacterial agents against E. coli, Klebsiella, Citrobacter and Proteus which were isolated from patients with urinary tract infections at 8 hospitals in Japan, were investigated by dilution broth method using MIC 2000 (Dynatec) during July to October in 1981. The summarized results are as follows: Among oral antibacterial agents, MPC and PPA have showed potent antibacterial activities against E. coli and Klebsiella. In vitro activities of oral antibacterial agents against Proteus and Citrobacter showed not so potent. Among the first and second generation's parenteral antibacterial agents, CTM has showed potent antibacterial activities against E. coli and Klebsiella. Among the third generation's parenteral antibacterial agents, CMX, CTX and CZX have showed potent antibacterial activities against E. coli, Klebsiella, Proteus and Citrobacter.
