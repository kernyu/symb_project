Out of 1,219 pediatric patients who were brought to our hospital with chief complaint of diarrhea and abdominal pain and in whom stool cultures were obtained for bacteriological studies in the 17 month period from May 1 in 1981 to September 30 in 1982, Campylobacter jejuni was isolated in 203 patients (16.7%). In this study we assessed the efficacy of fosfomycin (FOM) for C. jejuni enteritis. Results of antibiotic susceptibility tests revealed that C. jejuni is highly sensitive to FOM. The efficacy of FOM was confirmed both clinically and bacteriologically. Moreover, improvement in diarrheal symptoms and the duration required for cultural conversion under FOM treatment were assessed. From the results obtained, it was considered that FOM is an antibiotic with high efficacy for the treatment of C. jejuni enteritis.
