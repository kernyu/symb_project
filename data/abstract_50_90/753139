Occurrence of non-fermenting Gram-negative bacteria was investigated by the Authors in various clinical specimens expecially of compromised hosts. 15 non-fermenting Gram-negative bacterial strains were isolated and identificated by two routine diagnostic systems. Isolates, were resistant to tetracycline, ampicillin, chloramphenicol and carbenicillin, while were shown to have different pattern of susceptibility to the aminoglycoside antibiotics examined.
