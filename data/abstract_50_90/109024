A continuing study of the frequency of primary drug resistance among children treated at the Kings County Hospital Center of Brooklyn during the years 1973 through 1977 showed a high incidence of primary drug resistance to isoniazid (8.8 per cent) and to streptomycin (12.3 per cent). In contrast, there were no strains resistant to cycloserine, viomycin, ethambutol, or rifampin, and only one of 57 strains (1.8 per cent) was resistant to ethionamide, and one (1.8 per cent) was resistant to para-aminosalicylic acid. Comparison with previous studies begun in 1961 showed no significant increase in resistance to isoniazid during 3 prior periods of study and no increase in resistance to streptomycin during the last 2 periods of study. It must be emphasized that these findings relate only to the children of a local community, and do not reflect the prevalence of primary drug resistance elsewhere in this country or among different age groups.
