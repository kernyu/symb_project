One hundred consecutive isolates of N. gonorrhoeae were tested for susceptibility to penicillin, ampicillin, tetracycline, erythromycin, kanamycin, cephaloridine and cephalexin by an agar dilution method. Relative resistance to penicillin was frequent. For 39% of isolates the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of penicillin was 0.05 U./ml. or less; in 55% the MIC was 0.5 to 2.0 U./ml. Ampicillin was slightly more active than penicillin G: all isolates were inhibited by 0.5mug./ml. or less. Resistance to tetracycline and erythromycin was frequent with MIC of 1 mug./ml. or greater observed in 32 and 24% of isolates respectively. The MIC of kanamycin for all gonococci was 8 mug./ml. or greater. Cephalexin was slightly more active than cephaloridine, though each drug exhibited a wide range of MIC values. Gonococcus isolates resistant to penicillin (MIC of 1.0 U./ml. or greater) tended to be resistant to the other antibiotics tested.
