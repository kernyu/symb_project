Cefmetazole (CMZ), an antibiotic agent of the cephamycin group, is resistant to beta-lactamase and has a broad antibacterial spectrum covering Gram-positive cocci and Gram-negative bacilli. However, it has not been indicated for Gram-positive cocci. We examined its clinical, bacteriological and side effects in 2 infants with pneumonia and 2 with pyothorax, which had been suggested to be caused by CEZ-resistant and CMZ-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus or other inflammatory organisms by a disc sensitivity test, for 2 years and 3 months from January, 1981 to March, 1983. The patients aged 1 to 22 months, and a mean daily dose of 108 to 115 mg/kg was divided into 2 to 4 equal doses and injected into the vein at one shot for a mean fo 19 days. The following results were obtained: The clinical effect of CMZ was evaluated to be good in 1 and fair in 1 of 2 infants with pneumonia, and excellent in 1 and good in 1 of 2 with pyothorax. Bacteriologically, S. aureus was removed in an infant with pneumonia and in 2 with pyothorax. Bacteriological test was not conducted in the remaining 1 with pneumonia. No side effects were found in any cases. Eosinophilia appeared as an abnormal clinical test value in a case, but the number of eosinophils became normal after termination of the medication. As mentioned above, CMZ manifested an excellent clinical effect in infants with pneumonia or pyothorax caused by S. aureus although the number of the patients was small. From the results the antibiotic agent can be expected to be effective in these disease.
