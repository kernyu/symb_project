The number of strains of Proteus studied was 413, and these were obtained from all clinical materials with the exception of fecal specimens. Lactose was fermented by 37 strains (P. inconstans, 29%; P. rettgeri, 16%; P. mirabilis, 4.2%; P. morganii, 3.6%; and P. vulgaris, 0%) of which 33 were from the genitourinary system. These 33 strains constituted 12.7% of the 260 strains isolated from this source. Biochemically, P. mirabilis was the least variable, and P. rettgeri was the most variable of the five species of Proteus tested. P. inconstans and P. rettgeri resembled each other more closely than any of the other species of Proteus. Comparison of results obtained in the Memphis area with those found in other locations showed that biochemical characteristics varied most with the substances citrate, salicin, xylose, trehalose, and mannitol. In contrast to earlier reports from Israel and England, none of the strains of P. inconstans in the present study was able to attack urea. All five species of Proteus tested (by the disc method) were highly susceptible to methenamine mandelate. P. mirabilis, P. morganii, and P. vulgaris were also highly susceptible to nitrofurantoin. All strains of P. mirabilis were susceptible to ampicillin. P. inconstans was the most resistant species of Proteus. Of the other 356 urease-positive strains tested, 79% were susceptible to chloramphenicol, whereas only 3.8% of the 56 urease-negative strains (P. inconstans) were susceptible. When tested with streptomycin, 61% of urease-positive strains were susceptible and 1.8% of the urease-negative strains were susceptible. Of 36 lactose-positive strains, 33.8% were susceptible to chloramphenicol, whereas 72.8% of all lactose-negative strains were susceptible. Again, of the lactose-positive strains, 17% were susceptible to streptomycin, whereas 56.3% of all lactose-negative strains were susceptible.
