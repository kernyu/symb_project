Cefuroxime is a new semisynthetic cephalosporin for parenteral administration. It is resistant to destruction by beta-lactamases produced by staphylococci and most Gram-negative aerobic bacteria and is active against many bacteria resistant to cephalothin. Cefuroxime is the most active of the cephalosporins against gonococci and Haemophilus influenzae particularly against beta-lactamase producing strains. Given by intramuscular or intravenous injection cefuroxime is effective against a wide variety of infections caused by Gram-positive or Gram-negative aerobes, but has no effect against infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa or B. fragilis. Cefuroxime is of value in the treatment of respiratory infections due to Haemophilus influenzae and Streptocococcus pneumoniae and is useful against cephalosporin-resistant Klebsiella and Enterobacter infections. Cefuroxime is an alternative to spectinomycin for the treatment of beta-lactamase producing Neisseria gonorrhoeae infections. It is generally well tolerated and appears not to be nephrotoxic when given alone at usual dosages.
