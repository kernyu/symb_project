The R factors RP1, R68 and R91 were freely transmissible to and from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhimurium, and various plant pathogenic Erwinia spp. The antibiotic resistance spectrum of R+ Erwinia recipients was similar to those of other bacteria harboring these R factors, but maximum resistance levels differed with each recipient. The sponstaneous elimination of these factors from the Erwinia strains and the ability to transfer multiple antibiotic resistance suggest that these exist as plasmids in these hosts. Several, but not all, RP1-carrying Erwinia strains were sensitive to the RP1 specific phage PRR1. The R factor R18-1 was also transferred from P. aeruginosa to Erwinia spp. R18-1 was unstable in all Erwinia strains. Stable strains were isolated in which R18-1 could not be eliminated by sodium dodecyl sulfate and could not be transferred to other strains.
