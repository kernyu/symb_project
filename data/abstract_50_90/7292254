A mutant, CTM422, resistant to low dose of tunicamycin (TM) was isolated from Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, and it showed 7- to 10-fold higher resistance to TM than CHO. We further mutagenized CTM422, to isolate TM-high-resistant mutants which were resistant to about 100-fold higher dose of TM than CHO. The TM-high-resistant mutants (N101 and N102) acquired about 4-fold higher cross-resistance to 2-deoxy-d-glucose than CHO or CTM422, while both CHO and CTM422 showed similar sensitivity to 2-deoxy-d-glucose. TM-low-resistance appeared to be codominant, and TM-high-resistance was partially codominant against TM sensitivity, respectively. The transfer activity of N-acetylglucosamine from UDP-N-acetylglucosamine into the lipid fraction with CHO and CTM422 cell extracts was inhibited by TM to a similar extent, while the extract of N102 cells showed about 10-fold higher resistance to TM than CHO or CTM422.
