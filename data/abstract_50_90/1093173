We report the isolation of a mutant of E. coli in which the capacity to synthesize RNA polymerase (EC 2.7.7.6) (the beta and beta' subunits) is rapidly lost at 43 degrees. The mutation has no effect on the stability or activity of the polymerase itself. The mutation is recessive and is closely linked to the rif locus (the structural gene for the beta subunit). Using strains carrying the mutation, we have shown that polymerase is present in excess in rapidly growing E. coli cells.
