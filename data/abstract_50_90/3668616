Potential acetylcholine receptor (AChR) mutants of the nematode are selectable by resistance to the neurotoxic drug levamisole, a probable cholinergic agonist. To determine which mutants may have achieved resistance through loss of levamisole receptor function, we have assayed mutant extracts for specific 3H-meta-aminolevamisole binding activity in the presence and absence of mecamylamine. We find that mutants in 3 of the 7 genes associated with extreme levamisole resistance are obviously deficient in saturable specific 3H-meta-aminolevamisole binding activity. Mutants of the 4 other genes have abnormal binding activities that fail to undergo the apparent allosteric activation of saturable specific 3H-meta-aminolevamisole binding activity caused by mecamylamine. Thus, all 7 genes appear to be required to produce a fully functional levamisole receptor. Mutants of several other genes associated only with partial resistance to levamisole have at least grossly normal receptor binding activities.
