We examined effects of novobiocin alone or in combination with gamma-irradiation, on the frequencies of chromatid-type aberrations in a novobiocin-resistant subline of Chinese hamster V79 cells (NOVOr-1). NOVOr-1 cells were significantly resistant to novobiocin, as compared to wild-type V79 (WT) cells, with respect to cell survival and DNA synthesis. Survival responses of WT and NOVOr-1 cells to gamma-rays in the range 2-10 Gy differed only slightly and the number of chromatid aberrations produced by irradiation at 1 Gy was fairly comparable in the two cell types. Post-irradiation treatment of cells with novobiocin at concentrations exceeding 200 micrograms/ml significantly increased the number of chromatid gaps plus breaks in WT cells as compared with NOVOr-1 cells. With 200 micrograms/ml the increase was 1.2-fold (t-test, P less than 0.05) and with 400 micrograms/ml, 2.3-fold (P less than 0.01) the number produced in NOVOr-1 cells.
