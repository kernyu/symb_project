Growth, amino acid transport, and oxygen consumption of Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium are inhibited by short-chain (C(2)-C(6)) but not by medium or long-chain fatty acids (C(10)-C(18)) at concentrations at which these processes are completely inhibited in Bacillus subtilis. The resistance of gram-negative organisms is not correlated with their ability to metabolize fatty acids, since an E. coli mutant unable to transport oleic acid is still resistant. However, mutants of both E. coli and S. typhimurium in which the lipopolysaccharide layer does not contain the residues beyond the 2-keto-3-deoxyoctonate core are inhibited by medium (C(10)) but not by long-chain (C(18)) fatty acids. Furthermore, removal of a portion of the lipopolysaccharide layer by ethylenediaminetetraacetate treatment renders the organisms sensitive to medium and partially sensitive to long-chain fatty acids. The intact lipopolysaccharide layer of gram-negative organisms apparently screens the cells against medium and long-chain fatty acids and prevents their accumulation on the inner cell membrane (site of amino acid transport) at inhibitory concentrations. These results are relevant to the use of antimicrobial food additives, and they allow the characterization of gram-positive versus gram-negative bacteria and their lipopolysaccharide mutants.
