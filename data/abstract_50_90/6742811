Bacteriological assay of the nasal, fauces and feces microflora of 40 newborns of the Department of Intensive Therapy revealed their primary colonization with various opportunistic microorganisms from the environment. Sensitivity of the isolates to 15 antibiotics was tested. It was shown that multiple resistance strains predominated. The staphylococcal strains were mainly resistant to benzylpenicillin, ampicillin, erythromycin and polymyxin. The enterococci were most frequently resistant to methicillin, lincomycin, kanamycin, monomycin and neomycin. Tetracycline and chloramphenicol resistant strains of E. coli were detected. Marked resistance to carbenicillin, ampicillin, cephuroxim and cephaloridin and high sensitivity to cephotaxim and gentamicin were determined in the Klebsiella strains with the method of serial dilutions on solid media. The presence of opportunistic microorganisms with multiple resistance to antibiotics, ate appearance of the own microflora and decreased immunological defence may be the cause of infection in newborns of departments of intensive therapy. Circulation of antibiotic-resistant strains in departments for newborns is fraught with a threat of hospital infections.
