We found Tn2671 (the 23-kb long IS1-flanked r-determinant of NR1-Basel) inserted into the ampicillin resistance gene bla of the Tn3-related transposon Tn902. The resulting 28-kilobase-long composite transposon Tn2672 (= Tn902 bla::Tn2671) is stable, and it translocates as a unit into various loci including IS1 of the resistance transfer factor of R100-1. These results are discussed with respect to the evolution of R plasmids providing multiple drug resistance.
