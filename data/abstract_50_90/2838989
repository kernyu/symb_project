Electrophoretic study of the profile of plasmid DNA in agarose gel has shown the presence of a plasmid with a molecular weight of 55-60 MD in K. pneumoniae strains possessing antilysozyme activity. Plasmid pAlz60 of K. pneumoniae 22-110, isolated from the blood of a septicemia patient, is a fi- type conjugative plasmid. This plasmid is transferred to recipient strains of different species of enterobacteria with a frequency of 1 X 10(-5) to 1 X 10(-7). Simultaneously with the transfer of the plasmid, recipient cells inherit the antilysozyme markers and resistance to a number of drugs. The discovered plasmid has one restriction site for each of endonucleases EcoRI and XhoI and 16-20 sites for restrictases KpNI, BglII and Hind III.
