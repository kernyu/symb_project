The study concerns the synthesis and properties of interferons induced at various temperatures (26 degrees C and 37 degrees C) with Newcastle Disease Virus (NDV) in mouse lymphocytes from peritoneal cavity. The results obtained revealed differences in the kinetics of their production. IFN synthesis at 37 degrees C proceeded fast while at 26 degrees C this process was slower and longer lasting. Besides, it was shown that both interferons differ in antigenic properties, molecular weight--IFN (37 degrees C)--26,000, IFN (26 degrees C)--40,000, and resistance to temperature (56 degrees C).
