Netilmicin is a new semisynthetic aminoglycoside which was developed by Schering Corporation, USA, for the treatment of serious gram-negative and staphylococcal infections. Nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity in animal studies have indicated that netilmicin is both quantitatively and qualitatively safer than other aminoglycosides. Also, netilmicin has a broader spectrum of activity than either gentamicin or tobramycin. 37 clinical studies were conducted by 29 investigators in 10 countries. 840 courses of treatment in 960 infection sites were analyzed for effectiveness. Of the 724 courses in which a clinical determination could be made, 91% had either complete resolution or improvement. Bacteriologic responses were available for 782 infecting organisms and showed an 82% elimination rate. The pharmacokinetic profile of netilmicin permits twice daily administration in most patients with systemic infections and in all patients with urinary tract infections. The clinical safety of netilmicin was measured in 890 evaluable treatment courses, and only 0.4% auditory reactions, 0.6% vestibular reactions, and 0.9% renal reactions were considered to be probably netilmicin related, when netilmicin was given as recommended.
