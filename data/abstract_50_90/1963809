The bacterial neo gene from transposon Tn903 (Tn601) was used for dominant transformation of the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. It was found that high transformation efficiency was dependent on a high level of promoter activity, mediated by the strong promoter of the Schizosaccharomyces pombe alcohol dehydrogenase gene (adh1), as shown by comparing the efficiency of transformation to G418-resistance, the resistance levels of transformed cells, and the in vitro amino-glycoside phosphotransferase activity. On the other hand, the heterologous promoter of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae alcohol dehydrogenase I gene (adc1) is shown to be a weak promoter in Schizosaccharomyces pombe, though its activity is significantly enhanced in cells grown on glycerol as a carbon source. This system for selection and detection of promoter-active sequences may provide a useful basis for the analysis of promoter elements in fission yeast.
