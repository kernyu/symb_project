A number of 2',3'- and 3',5'-di-O-acyl derivatives of 9-beta-D-arabinofuranosyladenine (1) were prepared and evaluated as antivirals. These compounds, designed as prodrugs of 1, offer a range of solubilities and lipophilicities, as well as a resistance to adenosine deaminase, that render some as being attractive as possibly useful antiviral agents. Of particular note is 9-(2,3-di-O-acetyl-beta-D-arabinofuranosyl)adenine that was found to be effective as a topical agent in a guinea pig model of genital herpes.
