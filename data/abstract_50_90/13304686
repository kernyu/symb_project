Strains of antibiotic-resistant staphylococci that develop in a hospital are becoming increasingly important as a cause of untoward complications of hospitalization. The hospital environment and hospital personnel present the chief reservoir of antibiotic-resistant strains; and they, as well as patients discharged after hospital stay, may represent the greatest source of antibiotic-resistant strains found in the community at large.Cross infection appears to be thwarted by rigid adherence to antiseptic techniques.
