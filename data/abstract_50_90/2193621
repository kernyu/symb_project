The enzyme that modifies fosfomycin by formation of an adduct with glutathione was purified 12-fold with a 56% activity yield by passage through DEAE Sephacel and high-performance liquid chromatography molecular exclusion columns. Its functional form was a homodimer of two 16,000-dalton polypeptides, which possibly showed an antiparallel alpha tertiary structure and which lacked marked hydrophobic regions. Visualization of the reaction was achieved by precolumn derivatization of glutathione and the adduct, separation by high-performance liquid chromatography, and fluorescence detection of both compounds. Temperature and pH optima were 20 to 30 degrees C and 8.25, respectively; Mn2+, Fe2+, and Co2+ enhanced the rate of modification; and Km values were 9.4 and 11 mM for fosfomycin and glutathione, respectively. Phosphoenolpyruvate did not interfere with fosfomycin modification. The enzyme was stable at 4 degrees C for at least 6 months but progressively lost its activity upon being heated for 60 min at temperatures over 30 degrees C.
