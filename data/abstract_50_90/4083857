The properties of the membrane respiration apparatus of three clinical staphylococcal strains and their novobiocin resistant variants were studied comparatively. Changes in the specific activity of the respiration enzymes were shown: when the dehydrogenase activity of the membrane preparations of the sensitive and resistant variants was equal and the specific quantity of cytochromes in the novobiocin resistant staphylococci was lower, the oxidase activity of their respiration chains was increased by 60-70 per cent. Disintegration of the cells of the novobiocin resistant staphylococci resulted in a higher yield of the membrane protein, the membrane fraction being characterized by a activity of phospholipase A.
