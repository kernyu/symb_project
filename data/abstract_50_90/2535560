Thirty eight enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) isolated from children with acute diarrhea were analyzed in order to assess the possible associations among enterotoxigenicity, antibiotic resistance and other plasmid-mediated virulence properties such as CoIV, Hly and CFA/I. Eighty four percent of ETEC strains were multiresistant. Twenty strains (52.63%) were able to transfer one or more properties studied and 92.68% of the transconjugants were multiresistant. The simultaneous transfer of genes encoding ST enterotoxin and CoIV, Hly or CFA/I was very low (1.82%). The plasmid analysis revealed the presence of a heterogeneous enterotoxigenic (Ent) plasmid population. Additionally, the existence of a conjugative plasmid of approximately 31 megadaltons (Md) of molecular weight encoding for ST and resistance to ampicillin, kanamycin and streptomycin was found. However, this plasmid was not present in all isolates. These results show a diversity of Ent plasmid population which is probably a consequence of the indiscriminate use of antibiotics and the molecular mechanism of transposition of ST and drug-resistance in the evolution of bacterial strains.
