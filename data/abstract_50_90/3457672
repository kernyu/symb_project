The in vitro activity of cefotetan, a new cephamycin, was compared with that of cefoxitin, cefotaxime, moxalactam, and piperacillin against 368 strains of anaerobic bacteria. Cefotetan was similar to cefoxitin, moxalactam, and piperacillin in its activity against B. fragilis, B. vulgatus, Bacteroides species, anaerobic gram-positive cocci, Fusobacterium and Clostridium species. High resistance rates for cefotetan, however, were demonstrated among B. thetaiotaomicron-ovatus group and B. distasonis. Increasing inoculum concentrations had little effect on the activity of cefotetan.
