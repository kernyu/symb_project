The mechanism of staphylococcal resistance to methicillin is unknown. Peptidoglycan synthesis was studied in a methicillin-resistant and a derived methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus strain. Although the methicillin minimum inhibitory concentration for growth of the methicillin-resistant strain was 1,600 micrograms/ml, peptidoglycan synthesis by the organism incubated in a wall synthesis solution was inhibited about 90% by 5 micrograms of methicillin per ml. In contrast, high concentrations of methicillin added to actively growing cultures of the methicillin-resistant strain had little effect on growth or peptidoglycan synthesis. Peptidoglycan synthesis in chloramphenicol-treated cultures was more susceptible to methicillin than it was in actively growing cultures of the methicillin-resistant strain. It is proposed that in this strain cell wall thickening peptidoglycan synthesis which predominates in cell wall synthesis solution and chloramphenicol-treated cultures is methicillin sensitive, whereas peptidoglycan synthesis involved in cell division, primarily in the region of the septum, which predominates in actively growing cultures is methicillin resistant. Both cell wall thickening and septal peptidoglycan syntheses are methicillin sensitive in the methicillin-sensitive strain.
