A 47-year-old man with chronic osteomyelitis of the mandible is described. The patient had frequent episodes of acute and subacute exacerbation at varying intervals for a period of six years in spite of extended antibiotic therapy. Intraarterial infusion of antibiotics through the superficial temporal artery also failed to cause any improvement. He was finally treated successfully by surgical intervention.
