About 5% of all patients fall ill with anosocomial infection, i.e. one acquired in hospital. Among the principal causes of this are therapeutic measures which lead to an increased exposure of patients to organisms (soiled artificial respiration equipment, venous catheters, urinary catheters etc.) and to a raised disposition in the patients due to reduction of endogenous defense (cytostatic therapy, corticoids irradiation, operations etc.). Cross infections are largely transmitted on the hands of doctors and nursing personnel. The detection, prevention and control of hospial infections by specially trained personnel (hospital infection officers, specialist hygiene nurses, hospital hygiene committees) is absolutely necessary and justified for economic reasons alone.
