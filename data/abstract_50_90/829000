The sensibility of 3100 Streptococcus agalactiae strains and 600 Staphylococcus aureus strains to antibiotics was examined in 1975 in the veterinary institute of the Slovak Socialist Republic by the plate diffusion test. The strains were collected from the dairy cow's milk samples. Of the Streptococcus agalactiae strains there were sensible 100% to ampicillin, 99.06% to chloramphenicol, 98.13% to erythromycin, 96.12% to oxytetracycline, 91.11% to bacitracin, 58.12% to penicillin, 23.92% to neomycin, 17.78% to streptomycin. Of the Staphylococcus aureus strains there were sensible 97.48% to erythromycin, 97.14% to chloramphenicol, 95.15% to ampicillin, 94.81% to bacitracin, 93.26% to oxytetracycline, 92.49% to neomycin, 85.37% to streptomycin and 46.02% to penicillin. The results are being more thoroughly analysed and compared in the dicussion.
