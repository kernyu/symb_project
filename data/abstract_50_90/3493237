Imipenem is one of the carbapenem class of new beta-lactam antibiotics. It is a potent antibacterial with a broad spectrum of activity. Against Gram-negative rods, it appears to be able to circumvent the classical resistance mechanisms by way of its high affinity for PBP 2 and its good penetration of the cell wall. Imipenem is stable to hydrolysis by the common plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases and is a potent inducer of, but stable to the action of, chromosomal beta-lactamases.
