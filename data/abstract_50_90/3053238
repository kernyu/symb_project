Five-hundred and twenty seven strains of Salmonella isolated from different patients admitted to hospitals in Rome from 1982 to 1985 were screened for their resistance to antimicrobial drugs. Sixty-one strains (11.6%) were found to be resistant to two or more antibiotics; the most frequent resistances were to sulfathiazole, streptomycin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol and ampicillin. Of the thirty-eight strains showing resistance to three or more antibiotics, 17 were able to transfer their resistance to E. coli K 12. The isolates were heterogeneous in plasmid population: only few strains harbored a sole plasmid, most harbored many plasmids ranging between 20 and 120 megadaltons in weight. Most strains were found to carry a conjugative plasmid of incompatibility group Inc H of 100-120 megadaltons and Inc I alpha of 60-70 megadaltons.
