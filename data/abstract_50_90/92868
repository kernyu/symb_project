Gramicidin A effects a drastic decrease of the membrane resistance of frog skeletal muscle fibres in isotonic K2SO4 solution. In detubulated fibres the effect is not so pronounced. The reduction of the membrane resistance is caused by an increase in the K+ conductance of the surface and T-system membranes of the muscle cell.
