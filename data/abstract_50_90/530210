Flavobacterium odoratum was isolated from the stumps of the amputated toes of a debilitated patient. Gentamicin therapy and the poor state of health of the patient provided suitable conditions for this gentamicin-resistant species to multiply. When the gentamicin therapy was stopped, and as the patient's heal improved, F. odoratum gradually disappeared to be replaced by Staphylococcus aureus. This appears to be the first report of the isolation of F. odoratum in Australia, and it indicates the potential of this resistant species to act as a source of infection for groups at risk.
