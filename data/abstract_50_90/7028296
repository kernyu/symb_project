The authors report a case of a multi-drug resistant Asiatic P. falciparum strain in a first non-immune man treated out of an endemic zone after failure of chemoprophylaxis by pyrimethamine-sulfadoxine. The authors compare this care with the lately published cases in Germany and Switzerland. They call again that I and II resistances were observed at the time of the drug's trials in and out of endemic zones. They ascertain that this resistances are often associated with chloroquino-resistance and that their number increases chiefly in certain areas.
