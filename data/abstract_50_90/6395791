Sensitivity of 56 streptococcal strains of group B to 12 antibiotics was studied with the method of dilution in a special solid medium for cultivation of streptococci and with the method of agar diffusion in the same medium. All the strains were found to be sensitive to chloramphenicol, ristomycin and erythromycin. The predominating majority of the strains were sensitive to beta-lactam antibiotics and lincomycin. All the strains were resistant to aminoglycoside antibiotics, such as streptomycin and gentamicin. More than 85 per cent of the strains were resistant to tetracycline. Strains with multiple resistance to 2-7 antibiotics were detected. Satisfactory correlation between the two methods was observed. It was shown to be clinically advisable to determine the sensitivity of streptococci of group B to beta-lactam antibiotics, erythromycin and lincomycin.
