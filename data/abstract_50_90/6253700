The most effective administration method of polymyxin B (PL-B), a peptide antibiotic, has been studied in the experimental mice infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. 1) Pseudomonas aeruginosa damaged by PL-B, when the drug was free, immediately began to regrow in vitro. 2) the therapeutic efficacy of PL-B on multiple administration was less effective than its single administration. 3) An important factor to decide the therapeutic efficacy of PL-B was the high drug concentration in plasma and peritoneal fluid.
