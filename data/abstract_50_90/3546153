Experience with ofloxacin in the United States in the treatment of sexually transmitted diseases is reviewed. In one study, a single oral dose of either 400 mg or 600 mg eradicated Neisseria gonorrhoeae in all 43 evaluable patients. In another multicenter study a seven-day course of ofloxacin 300 mg b.i.d. was as effective as a seven-day course of doxycycline 100 mg b.i.d. in eradicating N. gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis and, in men, Ureaplasma urealyticum. Because of increasing problems with antimicrobial resistance, particularly among strains of N. gonorrhoeae, ofloxacin, with its unique mechanism of action, and its broad spectrum activity against pathogens, may prove useful in the treatment of sexually transmitted diseases.
