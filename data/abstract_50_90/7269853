The in vitro antibacterial activity of metronidazole was tested against 70 strains of aerobic vibrios (V. cholerae biotype cholerae, V. cholerae biotype eltor, NAG-vibrios, V. parahaemolyticus, v. alginolyticus) and 30 strains of microaerophilic Campylobacter (C. fetus subsp. fetus, C. fetus subsp. intestinalis and C. fetus subsp. jejuni). All strains of aerobic vibrios proved to be resistant (MIC 100 micrograms/ml) in contrast to campylobacter strains which were sensitive (MIC 1-4 micrograms/ml) to the drug. The findings confirm that metronidazole can be considered to be a selective inhibitor of anaerobic microorganisms, but its action is not restricted to obligate anaerobes.
