The genetic composition of several recombinant strains, produced by mixed infection with an amantadine-sensitive and an amantadine-resistant influenza virus, have been compared with their response to amantadine. It is concluded that transfer of resistance or sensitivity to amantadine is determined by a single gene, that coding for the matrix protein.
