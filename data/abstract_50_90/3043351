Seven neonates with septicemia due to Gram negative bacteria resistant to beta-lactam received imipenem-cilastatin therapy. Bacteria isolated were Enterobacter cloacae [3], Enterobacter aerogenes [1], Klebsiella pneumoniae [1], Serratia marcescens [1], Pseudomonas fluorescens [1]. The MICs of imipenem were lower 1 microgram/ml. In 3 children septicemia occurred during previous antimicrobial chemotherapy. 3 IV 60 mg/kg doses of imipenem with amikacin (15 mg kg/d) were administered every day. For five children blood cultures were negative after 48 hours of treatment. E. aerogenes septicemia required pefloxacin because blood cultures remained positive (d5) despite an increased dosage (90 mg/kg/d). All children were cured and imipenem-cilastatin was not responsible for any complication. Those results demonstrate the efficacy of imipenem in the treatment of septicemia in newborns due to multiresistant Gram negative bacteria.
