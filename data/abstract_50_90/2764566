Megasphaera elsdenii belongs to the group comprising the ruminal and intestinal lactate- and sugar-fermenting species. In the present study the fermentation characteristics, metabolism of glucose and lactate, and susceptibility to antimicrobial agents of four ruminal strains were investigated. Particular attention was given to the mixed-substrate fermentation pattern and resultant fermentation acid profile. Lactate was utilized more rapidly than glucose in media with both carbon sources. Interaction of the two substrates changed the composition of fermentation end products toward more valerate and less propionate in cultures with glucose and lactate. Contrary to the indications in Bergey's Manual of Systematic Bacteriology, butyrate, not caproate, was the main end product of glucose metabolism. The strains examined were rather insensitive to many antimicrobial compounds, especially to ionophores and other antimicrobial feed additives.
