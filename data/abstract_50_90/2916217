We describe five patients with serious nosocomial infection caused by resistant Enterobacter cloacae. Four of the patients underwent cardiovascular operations and were infected with an identical, multiple beta-lactam resistant E cloacae strain. The fifth patient was admitted with several wounds and skin-ulcers containing both resistant and sensitive E cloacae of other types. The resistant strain caused septicemia in four patients; three developed multiorgan failure and one died. The most probable causes of these infections were an abundant and constant reservoir of E cloacae in a sink at the operating unit, periodical breakdown of barriere routines, and heavy use of cephalosporins.
