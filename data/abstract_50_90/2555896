Starting from the published data that demonstrate the annulling of the negative influence of diabetes-tuberculosis morbid association, the authors studied from the clinical, epidemiologic, paraclinical and therapeutical viewpoints 68 diabetic patients with pulmonary tuberculosis (31 men, 37 women) and a control group of 73 patients (57 men and 16 women), both groups were new cases under a first treatment. There was no difference as regards the onset, evolution up to the moment of detection and diagnosis, the presenting clinical and radiologic forms, the gravity of the cases, biologic test and evolution under treatment. These data demonstrate the efficiency of the present day treatment, regardless of the association of the two diseases, the annulling of the negative influence described in previous years, but also the lability of diabetic patients in spite of the control of tuberculosis by tuberculostatics.
