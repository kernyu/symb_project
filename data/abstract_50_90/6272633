Acetamide forms from metronidazole in cultures of either Entamoeba histolytica or Trichomonas vaginalis as it does in cultures of bacteria which are susceptible to this drug. Under aerobic conditions, the formation of acetamide is more rapid in a strain of T. vaginalis which is more susceptible to metronidazole. Thus, it appears that the formation of acetamide may be associated with the microbiocidal action of metronidazole.
