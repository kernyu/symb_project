The analysis of the results obtained on the study of 55 strains of Staph. aureus isolated from purulent excretion in the patients operated under conditions of artificial blood circulation provided a conclusion that most of the clinical staphylococcal cultures were highly resistant to the beta-lactamase sensitive antibiotics. It was supposed that the above strains possessed penicillinase plasmids, since all the cultures tested had penicillinase activity and were resistant to benzylpenicillin, the resistance exceeding 1.0 Unit/ml, in 70 percent of the cultures these properties were complemented with resistance to heavy metals salts and mercuric chloride. These cultures possessing penicillinase plasmids belonged mainly to the phage group, III and were polylysogenic.
