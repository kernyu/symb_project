Diamphenethide and a mixture of nitroxynil and hexachlorophane, which are effective against Fasciola hepatica in sheep, are effective in cattle if allowance is made for the slower rate of development and the more intense liver reaction which is associated with resistance. Adult parasites are mostly rejected around the time of maturity so that therapy in cattle must be directed against the early developmental stage using an appropriate drug.
