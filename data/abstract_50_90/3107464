Plasmid pair coexistence was studied both among nine Enterococcus faecalis hemolysin-bacteriocin (Hly-Bcn) plasmids, including pJH2, pAD1, pAM gamma 1, and pIP964, and between pIP964 and five R plasmids. Some of the Hly-Bcn plasmids used were derivatives encoding resistance to erythromycin or tetracycline. The Hly-Bcn plasmids were incompatible with each other; 40 to 100% displacement was observed bilaterally for eight pairs and unilaterally for one pair. In contrast, pIP964 stably coexisted with each of the R plasmids. Entry exclusion was associated with incompatibility for most of the Hly-Bcn plasmids. The nine Hly-Bcn plasmids harbored by E. faecalis form a distinct incompatibility (Inc) group, designated IncHly.
