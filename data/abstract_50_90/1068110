Cycloheximide-resistant mutants of Schizosaccharomyces pombe were isolated either as spontaneous mutants or after mutagenic treatment with nitrous acid, UV and N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG). Twenty-three spontaneous mutants and 64 induced mutants were analysed genetically. Crosses revealed that at least four loci, designated cyh1, cyh2, cyh3 and cyh4 are responsible for resistance. Alleles of cyh1 show good growth on either high (100 mug/ml) or low (40 mug/ml) concentrations of cycloheximide whereas alleles at the cyh2, cyh3 and cyh4 loci gorw well on 40 mug/ml but poorly on 100 mug/ml. Some alleles at the cyh2 and cyh3 loci are also temperature sensitive (ts), the ts phenotype being conferred by the same gene as the resistance. In diploids, cyh1 and cyh4 are re-essive to wild type whereas cyh2 and cyh3 are semi-dominant. There was no intragenic complementation between three cyh1 alleles. Cross-resistance to trichodermin and anisomycin was shown by cyh2, cyh3 and cyh4 but not cyh1. Most cyh1 alleles, of spontaneous and UV origin only, were cold sensitive (cs) at 14 degrees and some of these were also cycloheximide dependent at the same temperature. It is suggested that the cyh1 and cyh4 genes are involved in ribosome formation or function and the other loci probably affect the uptake of cycloheximide by the cells.
