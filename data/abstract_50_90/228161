A high level viomycin resistant mutant of Mycobacterium smegmatis ATCC 14468 (AC16) was analyzed genetically and biochemically in an attempt to understand the mechanisms of expression of high level viomycin resistance and co-resistance to kanamycin and streptomycin. Genetic analysis has shown that at least three different genes (vicC, str, and kan) were involved in the phenotypic expression of drug resistance in AC16, and high level resistance to viomycin was due to interactions between the products of these genes.
