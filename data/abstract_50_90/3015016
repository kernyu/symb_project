The MICs of ampicillin, ampicillin plus sulbactam in equal proportions, and a range of ampicillin concentrations with a constant 0.5 micrograms/ml concentration of sulbactam were determined for 66 strains of Haemophilus ducreyi by an agar dilution technique with standardized inocula prepared by ultrasonication. Fifty-five strains were susceptible to ampicillin alone (MIC range, 0.06 to 1 microgram/ml). The MICs for the 11 resistant strains were (micrograms per milliliter): range, 8 to greater than 16; MIC for 50% of the strains tested (MIC50), greater than 16; MIC90, greater than 16; 8 of them produced beta-lactamase. In the presence of an equal concentration of sulbactam, the MICs for ampicillin-resistant strains were lowered to (micrograms per milliliter): range, 0.125 to 2; MIC50, 0.25; MIC90, 1. In the presence of a fixed 0.5-micrograms/ml concentration of sulbactam, the MICs for the resistant strains were (micrograms per milliliter): range, 0.125 to 2; MIC50, 0.125; MIC90, 0.25. Sulbactam-ampicillin appears to be suitable for the treatment of H. ducreyi infections, especially those caused by ampicillin-resistant strains.
