In this study; E. coli strains isolated from 100 patients with urinary tract infections were investigated for their antibiotic susceptibility and metabolic deficiencies. The strains were found to be highly susceptible to gentamicin (%97), Bactrim (R) (%77) and resistant to the other antibiotics in changing but important degrees. Study of metabolic deficiencies revealed that 9 of the strains were in accord with the deficiency criteria and only one of them was thymin-dependent.
