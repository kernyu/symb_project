The mitochondrial mutations conferring resistance to antibiotics erythromycin, neomycin, oligomycin and mucidin, have been isolated in a number of strains. An attempt was made to genetically map these markers. The principle of coretention/or loss of two markers in UV induced petite mutants was used for localisation of the mitochondrial markers. The unique order of markers E-O-M-N was established in our experiments. The preferential loss of the Nr marker in petite mutants was observed. No significant differences in the gene order and in gene relative distances were observed between our PG strain and other nonrelated strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
