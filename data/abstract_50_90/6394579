Vancomycin, introduced clinically about 30 years ago, has been used widely over the past decade because of the increasing incidence of methicillin-resistant staphylococci. Its bactericidal action, high and prolonged blood levels, the lack of development of resistant strains, and decreased adverse reactions with the more purified preparation now available, make it an excellent agent for staphylococcal infections due to strains resistant to the beta-lactam antibiotics. Recent articles reviewing the efficacy of vancomycin are summarized.
