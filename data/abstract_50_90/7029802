In vitro drug resistance tests of ten isolates of Plasmodium falciparum from three different collection points in Central Thailand have been carried out, and the results compared with those of similar tests with a drug-sensitive West African isolate. Judged by concentration of drug tolerated, the Thai isolates appeared to be about 10 times as resistant to chloroquine, and usually about 10(5) times as resistant to pyrimethamine, as the African isolate. A little variation amongst the Thai isolates was detected.
