The recombinant plasmid pRK101 carrying the complete replication origin of the antibiotic resistance factor R1 suffers frequently a deletion of 218 base pairs, removing parts or all of the origin sequence. This deletion seems to occur always when the Pst-E fragment carrying the replication origin is inserted into the cloning vector pBR322 in an orientation where the direction of R1 replication is the same as that of the vector plasmid and frequently when it is inserted in the opposite direction. DNA sequence analysis around the junction site generated by the deletion in three independently isolated deletion mutants reveals that the deletion occurs at a specific site, namely the end of a 22 bp sequence which is repeated almost identically at the other end of a segment of 197 bp. During the deletion one repeat unit is removed whereas the other is retained. The DNA sequence included by the two repeats contains high symmetric structures, i.e. inverted repeats, direct repeats and palindromes which may represent regulatory sites of the origin.
