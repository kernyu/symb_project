Sensitivity of cefamandole was tested in 560 strains including staphylococci and gram-negative bacilli. Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis strains were highly sensitive to cefamandole; beta-lactamase producers were slightly less sensitive. About 50% of gram-negative bacilli were sensitive to the concentration of cefamandole obtainable in serum, mainly to 15 micrograms/ml.
