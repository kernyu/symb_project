R factor 1818, which we have shown previously to be eliminated by thymine starvation, was cured from three strains of Escherichia coli K-12 by overnight exposure to trimethoprim. Elimination was abolished in the presence of added thymine or thymidine, which suggests that curing is the result of the induction of thymineless conditions by trimethoprim. Starvation of the required amino acids proline and histidine had little effect on elimination, whereas methionine deprivation enhanced it. R factor curing was abolished by the presence of chloramphenicol, and it is concluded that protein synthesis is required for elimination to occur. It is suggested that elimination may result from the activity of a nuclease which is synthesized or induced during both direct thymine starvation and by trimethoprim treatment.
