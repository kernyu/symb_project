The passive fluxes of protons and potassium ions have been studied in the obligatory aerobic yeast Rhodotorula gracilis. The cellular energy metabolism was suspended by introducing anaerobic conditions. The H+-permeability of the plasma membrane was modified by adding an uncoupler under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Unfortunately, the plasma membrane of R. gracilis was insensitive to K+-ionophores. The passive flows of H+ and K+ under anaerobic and/or uncoupled conditions were electrically coupled and exhibited a constant stoicheiometry of 1:1. The H+ permeability of the plasmalemma was shown to determine the velocity of the passive K+-H+ exchange. The nystatin-resistant mutant M 67 displayed distinctly lower permeability for both H+ and K+, which can explain the observed differences in some transport characteristics of the two strains. In order to account for the properties of passive K+ flows, a membrane-potential-gated channel for K+ has been proposed. Evidence is presented that the inhibitor of the plasmalemma-bound H+-ATPase, N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD), reduced at first the permeability for both K+ and H+ and only upon prolonged incubation the ATPase itself. Since DCCD effected an immediate hyperpolarization of the membrane potential, it has been concluded that the H+ does not slip through the H+-ATPase under deenergized conditions.
