The streptococcal plasmid pMV158 and its derivative pLS1 are able to replicate and confer tetracycline resistance in both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Copy numbers of pLS1 were 24, 4 and 4 molecules per genome in Streptococcus pneumoniae, Bacillus subtilis and Escherichia coli, respectively. Replication of the streptococcal plasmids in E. coli required functional polA and recA genes. A copy-number mutation corresponding to a 332 base-pair deletion of pLS1 doubled the plasmid copy number in all three species. Determination of the complete DNA sequence of pLS1 revealed transcriptional and translational signals and four open reading frames. A putative inhibitory RNA was encoded in the region deleted by the copy-control mutation. Two putative mRNA transcripts encoded proteins for replication functions and tetracycline resistance, respectively. The repB gene encoded a trans-acting, 23,000 Mr protein necessary for replication, and the tet gene encoded a very hydrophobic, 50,000 Mr protein required for tetracycline resistance. The polypeptides corresponding to these proteins were identified by specific labeling of plasmid-encoded products. The tet gene of pLS1 was highly homologous to tet genes in two other plasmids of Gram-positive origin but different in both sequence and mode of regulation from tet genes of Gram-negative origin.
