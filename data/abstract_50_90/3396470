The sensitivity to cefotaxime and amikacin of 14,272 Gram-negative bacilli (Enterobacteriaceae and non-fermenting Gram-negative bacilli) isolated from clinical samples was studied during the period 1980 to 1985. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined by means of diffusion in agar. Strains were considered resistant to cefotaxime and amikacin if the MIC values were greater than 16 mg/L and greater than 8 mg/L, respectively. The MIC90 reached the critical value for cefotaxime in the case of Citrobacter spp., Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella spp. and Shigella spp., and for amikacin in the case of Citrobacter spp., Enterobacter spp., E. coli, Klebsiella spp., P. mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Salmonella spp. and Serratia spp. Only Shigella spp. were sensitive to cefotaxime but not to amikacin, and only strains of Enterobacter spp. and Serratia spp. were sensitive to amikacin but not to cefotaxime.
