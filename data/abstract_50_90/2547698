Among mutants of Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) studied which were sensitive to chloramphenicol (Cmls), strains sensitive to a number of antibiotics (ristomycin, tetracycline, polymyxin, lincomycin) amount of 46%. Antibiotic-sensitive mutants are capable to form different classes of resistant revertants with frequency varying from 10(-2) to 10(-6) in independent strains. Ristomycin-sensitive clones (Rims) have been found to occur with high frequency in Cmls strains and Cmlr revertants. Mutations mediating the Rims phenotype are mapped in a locus linked to the gene for resistance to chloramphenicol. The results obtained are discussed, in accordance with the notion about possible role of cml mutation in induction of secondary mutational changes in the genome of S. coelicolor A3(2).
