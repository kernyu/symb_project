The conjugative IncN plasmid R15 (SmrSurHgr, 62.3 kb) is cleaved by the hexanucleotide-specific endonucleases BglII, HindIII, EcoRI, BamHI, SmaI, SalI, PstI and XhoI into 9, 9, 6, 5, 4, 4, 4 and 2 fragments, respectively. The restriction sites were located on the physical map of the R15 genome. Distribution of the cleavage sites is strongly asymmetric. 28 of 32 sites for BamHI, EcoRI, HindIII, SalI, SmaI and PstI were located close to or within the sequences of transposable elements Tn2353 and Tn2354. According to the results of analysis of R15::Tn1756 deletion derivatives and recombinant plasmids harboring fragments of R15, the genetic determinants for resistance to Sm, Su and Hg were mapped, as well as the regions necessary for EcoRII restriction--modification and for plasmid replication and conjugation. The features of physical and genetic structures of R15 and other IncN plasmids are discussed.
