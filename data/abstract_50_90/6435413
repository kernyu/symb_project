The antipseudomonal activity of so-called third and subsequent generation cephems was evaluated. The third and subsequent generation cephems have been reported to have antibacterial activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Their potency and clinical efficacy against pseudomonal infections, however, vary from drug to drug. Judging from our experience and our review of the literature, the four drugs, cefsulodin, cefoperazone, cefpiramide and ceftazidime are of value in clinical practice, though the effect of these drugs is not sufficient. In view of the fact that concomitant use of cefsulodin and cefmenoxime eradicated Pseudomonas aeruginosa in as much as 82.9% of the patients who had complicated UTI due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa, concomitant therapy of these four drugs in various combinations is a future subject to be studied.
