After IV, IM, and subcutaneous injection of single dosages of amikacin (5, 10, and 20 mg/kg of body weight) in each of 4 dogs, the elimination kinetics of amikacin were determined. The pattern of urinary excretion and cumulative amount excreted unchanged in 24 hours were also determined. Amikacin had a short half-life (approx 1 hour) that was independent of the dosage. Intravenous injection of 10 mg/kg gave apparent volume of distribution of 226 +/- 37 ml/kg and body clearance of 2.64 +/- 0.24 ml/min.kg (mean +/- SD, n = 4). Within 6 hours, greater than 90% of the antibiotic was excreted in the urine, regardless of the route of administration. For isolates of common bacterial species from the canine urinary tract, minimum inhibitory concentrations of amikacin, gentamicin, tobramycin, and kanamycin were determined in vitro. Cumulative percentages were approximately the same for urinary isolates of Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and coagulase-positive staphylococci that were susceptible (minimum inhibitory concentrations less than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml) to increasing concentrations of amikacin, gentamicin, and tobramycin, in vitro. Klebsiella pneumoniae was significantly more susceptible to amikacin than were the other bacteria evaluated. Widest variations in susceptibility to aminoglycosides were found with urinary isolates of streptococcal species. For dogs with normal renal function, an amikacin dosage of 10 mg/kg (IM or subcutaneously) is recommended every 8 hours for treatment of systemic infections, and every 12 hours for treatment of urinary tract infections caused by susceptible bacteria.
