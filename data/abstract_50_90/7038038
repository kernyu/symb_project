The mode of action of nosiheptide (multhiomycin) on bacterial protein synthesis is closely similar to that of thiostrepton. Both antibiotics inhibit functions of elongation factors Tu and G and greatly reduce the synthesis of guanosine penta- and tetraphosphates in response to stringent factor. Furthermore, the actinomycetes which produce these antibiotics defend themselves against their products in similar fashion. This involves specific pentose-methylation of 23S ribosomal RNA.
