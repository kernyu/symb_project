Although surgical mortality has decreased considerably in the antibiotic era, infectious complications still head the list of causes of death after operation. The choice of an antibiotic singly or in synergistic combinations should be governed by both the pathogenic organism and the organ involved. Allergy, toxicity and development of bacterial resistance are important limiting factors. Besides oxygen, antibiotics are indicated in dealing with localized or generalized anoxia as encountered in vascular impairment of intestinal obstruction or in shock. In acute abdominal conditions meticulous observation is required during the use of antibiotics in order to avoid dangerous delay of operation.
