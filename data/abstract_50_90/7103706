The Kirby-Bauer technique was employed in an assessment of the in vitro resistance to 8 antibiotics of 166 Enterobacteriaceae strains, isolated during routine diagnostic operations from various biological materials derived from wards, and from hospital out-patients. Their chemoresistance characteristics were also examined. It was found that Proteus strains from in-patients were more resistant to some antibiotics than those from out-patients. E. coli strains from in-patients were more frequently resistant to gentamycin.
