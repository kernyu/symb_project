The efficacy of ticarcillin and clavulanic acid (Timentin) was assessed in a regimen combined with tobramycin in febrile episodes in neutropenic patients. After randomization, 151 patients were assessable following treatment with either Timentin and tobramycin or piperacillin and tobramycin. The overall success rate was 70% in the Timentin and tobramycin group and 71% when piperacillin and tobramycin were given: when no infection could be demonstrated efficacy was 73% in the Timentin group, 65% when only clinical or radiological evidence of infection was present and 63% with conclusive microbiology. The figures in the groups treated with the piperacillin-containing regimen were 83%, 79%, and 50% respectively. There was no significant difference between the treatment groups. In septicaemic patients, the Timentin regimen was effective in 55% of cases, while the piperacillin group was successful in 40%. Timentin is a useful addition to the agents suitable for the treatment of febrile neutropenic patients.
