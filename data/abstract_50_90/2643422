Rats of the atherosclerosis-prone JCR:LA-corpulent strain were subjected to long-term low (0.5% wt/vol) or high (4% wt/vol) consumption of ethanol from 1 to 12 months of age. The corpulent rats are hyperphagic, obese, and insulin-resistant; exhibit a marked very low density lipoprotein hyperlipidemia; and develop both vascular and myocardial lesions while eating a normal rat chow. The total lipid profile of the rat sera showed only limited changes with ethanol consumption. There were also no significant effects on high density lipoprotein lipids. Ethanol consumption was associated with elevated fasting glucose concentrations in both lean and corpulent rats and a strong decrease in fasting insulin levels and pancreatic B-cell volume density in the hyperinsulinemic corpulent rats. The relative frequency of myocardial nodules of chronic inflammatory cells was increased in the ethanol-consuming rats, both lean and corpulent. In contrast, old organized lesions (scars) were absent in the ethanol-consuming corpulent rats. Thus, ethanol consumption had no major effect on serum lipids or lipoproteins in the corpulent rat but was associated with a reduction in insulin resistance and islet cell hyperplasia, with an associated decreased incidence of myocardial lesions.
