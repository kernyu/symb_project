Sink drains from the Veterans Administration Medical Center, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, and the Oklahoma City community were selectively cultured for gentamicin- and amikacin-resistant bacteria. Aminoglycoside-resistant organisms were found in 86% (Veterans Administration Medical Center, 88%; University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, 88%; and Oklahoma City community, 77%) of all 233 sink drains sampled. Of 207 sink drains harboring aminoglycoside-resistent organisms, 99% of the organisms were gentamicin resistant and 82% were amikacin resistant. These data suggest that aminoglycoside-resistent organisms are commonly present in the environment.
