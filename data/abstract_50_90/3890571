Five artemisinine-resistant mutants of Plasmodium falciparum have been isolated from a cloned parent following mutagenic treatment with N-methyl-N'-nitronitrosoguanidine. This observation may influence the strategy of the use of artemisinine or its derivatives. Mutant isolation should prove useful in the study of drug resistance to other antimalarials.
