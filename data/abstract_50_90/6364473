Data concerning 11 cases of cerebral malaria treated with high doses of chloroquine base (18mg/kg/day) are reported. The risk of chloroquine resistance (already described in Tanzania) and the fact that only chloroquine is available on the island of Pemba, were the reasons for increasing the usual dose. High doses clinically seem to offer better results, only one of 11 dying (9.1%) compared with four of 30 (13.3%) in the control group given normal doses. However, the lack of significant differences between the two groups and the greater risk with high doses of chloroquine may not always justify their use to overcome a RI chloroquine resistance in adults and adolescents.
