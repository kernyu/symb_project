The influence of different nutritional compounds on oleandomycin biosynthesis by Streptomyces antibioticus was studied, resulting in the design of a chemically defined medium for production of the antibiotic. Of the variety of carbon and nitrogen compounds tested, fructose and aspartic acid (carbon and nitrogen sources, respectively) supported the highest oleandomycin titres. Addition of propionate but not acetate, both precursors of the skeleton of the macrolide lactone ring, stimulated the biosynthesis of the antibiotic. Oleandomycin biosynthesis was repressed by glucose but not by phosphate. S. antibioticus develops oleandomycin resistance shortly before the antibiotic begins to be synthesized, showing a triphasic pattern of resistance: spores and producing mycelium are resistant, while non-producing mycelium is sensitive.
