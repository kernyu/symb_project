No evidence for significant increase in resistance to cefoperazone was detected in susceptibility test surveillance programs or in the literature through 1983, but rare endemic resistance to cefoperazone and some other newer beta-lactams was found. Medical centers contemplating the use of a third-generation drug for cost-containment should be aware of the susceptibility of isolates in their hospitals, and the drug's ability to withstand beta-lactamase hydrolysis by local pathogens. The possible dangers of inducible cephalosporins in certain Enterobacteriaceae and strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa are discussed in the light of the physical and chemical characteristics of the newer antimicrobial agents. Criteria for judging the values of investigational beta-lactams are presented. These focus on the interaction of antimicrobial agents with host defense mechanisms and circulating blood elements.
