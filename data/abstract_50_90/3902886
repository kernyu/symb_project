A broth screening method was developed to detect methicillin-resistant (heteroresistant) strains of Staphylococcus aureus from primary plates. Lyophilized vials containing cation-supplemented Mueller-Hinton broth, 2% NaCl, and 10 micrograms of methicillin and 6 micrograms of oxacillin per ml were hydrated and tested with 129 methicillin-resistant and 35 methicillin-susceptible strains of S. aureus. With the addition of a tetrazolium indicator after 5 h of incubation, 96.9% of resistant strains were detected. No false-positive results occurred.
