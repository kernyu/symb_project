Plasmids isolated from two different clinical isolates of Salmonella typhimurium, both resistant to the antibiotics ampicillin, tetracycline, streptomycin and chloramphenicol, were used to transform Escherichia coli. Segregation of antibiotic-resistance determinants occurred in both cases. Analysis of plasmids from one set of segregants by DNA-DNA hybridisation indicated that the segregation was due to precise deletions in the transforming plasmid.
