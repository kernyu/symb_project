The effects of 2,3,5-trimethyl-6-(12-hydroxy-5,10-dodecadiynyl)-1,4-benzoquinone (AA-861), a selective 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor, on immunological or non-immunological release of slow reacting substance of anaphylaxis (SRS-A) and histamine and its effects on experimental asthma were investigated. AA-861 showed a dose-dependent inhibition of SRS-A release, with no effect on histamine release from passively sensitized guinea pig, monkey (M. irus) and human lung fragments. An analysis of the anaphylactic diffusate from the human lung fragments, using the combined technique of high performance liquid chromatography and radioimmunoassay, revealed that AA-861 markedly suppresses biosynthesis of the leukotrienes. However, this drug inhibits the release of histamine as well as SRS-A from lung fragments of anaphylactic monkey (M. mulatta) and in the Ca ionophore-stimulated rat peritoneal cavity. AA-861 suppressed the anaphylactically-induced airway resistance in mepyramine- and cimetidine-treated guinea pigs. These results suggest that AA-861 may be clinically effective for treating allergy-related asthma by modulating the 5-lipoxygenase pathway and that an inhibitory mechanism of histamine release by AA-861 may be present in some species.
