The pleiotropic effects of nystatin resistant mutations have been studied. It has been shown that resistance to nystatin is often accompanied by temperature-sensitivity and, in some cases, by osmotic remedial sensitivity. The dependence of the expression of the mutations on temperature is demonstrated. A new type of conditional nystatin-dependent mutants is found. All nys2 mutants have a defected membrane and are stained on a methylene blue containing media. At the same time, the mutations under investigation do not affect the respiratory competence and the exoenzyme activity of acid phosphatases.
