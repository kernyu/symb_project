A rifampin-resistant, conditionally asporgoenous mutant of Bacillus subtilis was isolated that sporulates poorly in Sterlini-Mandelstam sporulation medium, but that sporulates normally in modified Difco sporulation medium. Rifampin-resistant (Rif-r) and conditional asporogenous (Spo-c) phenotypes co-transformed at 100% frequency. Preliminary genetic studies indicated the Rif-r trait to lie between cysA14 and ery, a locus (rnp) common to Rif-r mutants. Ribonucleic acid polymerase from strains bearing this mutation was found to be rifampin resistant in vitro. The loss of ability to sporulate in Sterlini-Mandelstam medium was found to be corrected, to a large extent, by addition to the medium of arginine, methionine, valine, and isoleucine. Several other amino acids had small effects, whereas others had no effect at all. The restorative effect is approximately additive. Growth studies indicated that Rif-r strains grew more rapidly than the corresponding parent in minimal medium at temperatures higher than 37 C. Addition of certain amino acids to the medium resulted in identical growth rates at these temperatures. Extracellular protease and esterase activities of the Rif-r Spo-c mutant were normal. A slight difference was found in the heat sensitivity of partially purified ribonucleic acid polymerase preparations of this mutant compared to the wild type.
