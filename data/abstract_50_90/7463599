A bacteriological survey was carried out on 30 black rhinoceros (Diceros bicornis) of which 23 were newly captured and seven were captive. A beta haemolytic Streptococcus, group L was found in skin lesions and various wounds, causing septicaemia and death in two animals. Staphylococcus aureus was found in 3 rhinoceros, and caused the death of one. The bacteria isolated often proved resistant to penicillin. Streptomycin is recommended for treatment. Sixteen other bacteria sp. were isolated, and apart from a Salmonella sp. none were considered to be specific pathogens.
