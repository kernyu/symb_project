Apnea during sleep has been associated with both increased pharyngeal resistance and nasal obstruction. Alcohol can worsen obstructive sleep apnea, but its influence on pharyngeal resistance and nasal patency has not been evaluated. Accordingly, we determined the effects of alcohol on pharyngeal and nasal resistances in 11 normal awake subjects on 2 separate days. Baseline pharyngeal resistance prior to placebo and alcohol was not significantly different. After placebo, pharyngeal resistance did not change significantly. However, after alcohol, pharyngeal resistance increased from 1.9 +/- 0.5 (SEM) to 3.3 +/- 0.8 cm H2O/L/s at 45 min (p less than 0.05) and returned to near baseline level by 90 min. Baseline nasal resistance varied considerably within subjects on the 2 days, but the mean values for baseline nasal resistance on alcohol and placebo days were not significantly different. Nasal resistance did not change after placebo, but after alcohol, nasal resistance increased from 2.4 +/- 0.9 at baseline to 3.7 +/- 0.8 at 45 min (NS) and to 4.3 +/- 1.2 cm H2O/L/s at 90 min (p less than 0.05). We conclude that a decrease in pharyngeal airway size and an increase in nasal resistance may account for alcohol's ability to worsen obstructive sleep apnea.
