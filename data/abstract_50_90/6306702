Transposon Tn7 insertion was used to obtain either transfer-defective (Tra-) or tetracycline-sensitive (Tc-) mutants of the HI incompatibility group (IncHI) plasmid R27. The 600 apparent R27::Tn7 derivatives fell into three classes: Tra-, Tc-, and Tra- Tc-. Mutants of R27 defective in the thermosensitive mode of transfer characteristic of IncH plasmids were obtained with transfer frequencies of less than 1 X 10(-8) transconjugants per recipient after 18 hr at 26 degrees C. These mutants, which were generated at a frequency of 1 per 100 insertions, were nonleaky and nonrevertible. Tc- mutants of R27, generated at a frequency of 0.5 per 100 insertions, were also nonrevertible. Loss of tetracycline resistance was associated with an increased frequency of transfer (average 3.6 X 10(-3) transconjugants per donor per hour at 30 degrees C) compared with transfer of the wild-type R27 plasmid (1.6 X 10(-8) per donor per hour). Tn7 insertions which generated Tc- or Tra- mutants of R27 had no effect on entry exclusion of other H group plasmids. The molecular weights of Tra- and Tc- R27::Tn7 derivatives were approximately 120.5 MDa, corresponding to the sum of R27 (112 MDa) and Tn7 (8.5 MDa). A third class of Tn7 insertion derivatives (Tra- Tc-) was obtained; however, strains expressing this phenotype were plasmid free, and appeared to have Tn7 integrated at a chromosomal site. Restriction digestion with XbaI and subsequent hybridization with ColE1::Tn7 were used to compare R27::Tn7 derivatives and to locate Tn7 insertion sites. Loss of tetracycline resistance was associated with Tn7 insertion into a 24-kb XbaI fragment of R27. Although loss of plasmid transfer in several R27::Tn7 derivatives was accompanied by insertion of Tn7 into a 14-kb XbaI fragment of the plasmid, these mutants had also undergone a small increase in the size of the 24-kb XbaI fragment of R27.
