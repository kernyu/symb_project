A procedure is described for the isolation, in Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO, of bacteria carrying derivatives of pVS1 that inherited the carbenicillin-resistance determinant from RP1 either alone or together with that for aeruginocin resistance. Such bacteria occur among the transconjugant progeny from both recombination-proficient or -deficient pVS1+ RP1+ donors, suggesting that the formation of these plasmids is due to the translocation of TnA from RP1 into pVS1. It is possible, therefore, that the aeruginocin-resistance determinant is part of TnA or is closely linked to it. Unexpectedly, none of these plasmids showed the 3 x 10(6)- to 4 x 10(6)-dalton increase in size predicted for TnA+ derivatives of PVS1. It is suggested that an interaction between TnA and the Tn501 translocation unit in pVS1 could account for this result.
