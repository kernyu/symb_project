A 7.5-kilobase-pair multiresistance transposon, Tn1331, harboring amikacin resistance was identified as part of Klebsiella pneumoniae plasmid pJHCMW1. Restriction mapping, hybridization, and transposition complementation experiments demonstrated that Tn1331 belongs to the Tn3 family. Its structure is similar to that of Tn3 with the insertion of a DNA fragment encoding resistance to amikacin, kanamycin, and tobramycin.
