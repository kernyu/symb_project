Eight patients with acute non-lymphocytic leukemia in adults refractory to Daunomycin (DM)-based conventional regimens were treated with AMSA-based regimens. Complete remission (CR) was obtained in 4 (50%) and partial remission (PR) in 2 (25%). The median time to CR was 26.5 days and 3 cases achieved CR in the first cycle. The median duration of CR was 8.3 months. Hematologic toxicity was severe and the nadir (median) of leukocytes and platelets was 0.15 x 10(3)/microliters and 15.5 x 10(3)/microliters, respectively. Other adverse effects were mucositis, nausea.vomiting and hepatotoxicity which occurred over 50%, while cardiac toxicity was not observed. This study indicates that AMSA is clinically non-cross-resistant to DM and considered to be an active drug for salvage therapy.
