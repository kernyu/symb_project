The chemistry, microbiology, pharmacokinetics, therapeutic use, adverse effects, and dosage of amoxicillin-potassium clavulanate, a beta-lactamase-resistant antibiotic combination, are reviewed. Clavulanic acid is a "suicide" inhibitor of bacterial beta-lactamase enzymes and has been effective in preventing destruction of penicillins by these enzymes. Clavulanic acid alone has weak antibacterial activity against most organisms. After oral administration, clavulanic acid is rapidly absorbed; amoxicillin appears to increase its absorption. Absorption of amoxicillin-clavulanic acid is not affected by food. Amoxicillin-clavulanic acid is effective in treating both acute uncomplicated and complicated urinary-tract infections and exacerbations of chronic bronchitis caused by amoxicillin-resistant organisms in adults. It appears to be comparable in efficacy to cefaclor for treating uncomplicated urinary-tract infections in adults and children, acute bronchitis and bronchopneumonia, and acute sinusitis, otitis media, and skin and soft-tissue infections in children. Other infections for which the combination has been effective include cellulitis and intra-abdominal and pelvic sepsis caused by mixed aerobic/anaerobic organisms. Amoxicillin-clavulanic acid has also successfully cured urethritis in men caused by penicillinase-producing Neisseria gonorrhoeae and is superior to amoxicillin alone for beta-lactamase-positive Haemophilus ducreyi infections (chancroid). Diarrhea or loose stools is the most common side effect seen with amoxicillin-clavulanic acid; nausea, vomiting, and skin rash may also occur. Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea may be lessened by taking the combination with food.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
