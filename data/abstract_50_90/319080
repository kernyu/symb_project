A study was carried out to determine the prevalence of significant bacteriuria in a mentally retarded population. With 100,000 or more bacteria per ml. of urine used as a criterion for significant bacteriuria, 24 of 665 persons studied were considered to have significant bacteriuria for an overall prevalence rate of 3.6%. Seventeen of the 24 positive urine cultures were either from clean catch or catheter specimens. All patients undergoing catheterization were found to have significant bacteriuria. The individual prevalence rates of significant bacteriuria for males and females were 1.7 and 5.6 respectively. In females, an increasing prevalence of bacteriuria was found primarily in the 55-64 age group. The predominant bacteria isolated from bacteriuric patients were gram-negative bacilli, Escherichia coli, being isolated in 50% of all positive cultures. Antiobiotic sensitivity patterns of the isolates indicated a high degree of in vitro resistance to both ampicillin and cephalothin.
