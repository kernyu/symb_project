Metabolic activities in relation to protein synthesis and amino acid utilization are altered in Vibrio El Tor after development of resistance towards streptomycin. Efficiency of in vivo and in vitro protein synthesis is markedly reduced in streptomycin resistant Vibrio El Tor. The rate of incorporation of 14C-amino acids into protein, uptake of 14C-valine and oxidation of certain amino acids are also altered.
