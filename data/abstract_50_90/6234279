Norfloxacin, a new oral quinolone antimicrobial agent, was shown to have considerably greater activity than nalidixic acid and cinoxacin against sensitive and resistant strains of Enterobacteriaceae. A clinical trial was carried out comparing norfloxacin with amoxycillin in two groups of 20 geriatric patients with complicated urinary tract infection. The cure rate was 95% with norfloxacin and 75% with amoxycillin. Failures of treatment were due to increased bacterial resistance in most cases. Norfloxacin was well tolerated by all patients and no changes were noted in the toxicological assessment. Norfloxacin is a valuable addition to the oral antimicrobial agents available for the treatment of urinary tract infection.
