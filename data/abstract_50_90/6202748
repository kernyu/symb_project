An outbreak of infection in a special care baby unit due to a multiply-resistant Staphylococcus aureus is described. Although the organism was isolated from 35 babies over 1 year, only two were clinically infected, one of whom died of infection. New measures to prevent cross-infection were introduced but colonized babies continued to be detected. The unit was closed for several weeks but babies became colonized again after reopening. The route of cross-infection remained uncertain.
