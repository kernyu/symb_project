In this work we carry out an epidemiologic investigation of the incidence of Staphylococci in some hospitals of east Sicily, in relation with hospitalized patients. The tests were performed every ten days for a period of four months, by using Fisher technique. The strains were isolated from clinical specimens from hospitalized patients, and after identification, we made antibiotics-resistance essays. The results show a correlation between Staphylococcus strains isolated from patients and that of environmental origin, also for the antibiotics resistance spectrum.
