A new component, nanaomycin E, has been isolated from the culture broth of Streptomyces rosa var, notoensis, which had been found to produce nanaomycins A, B, C and D. Nanaomycin E was an epoxy derivative of nanaomycin A and was converted into nanaomycin A and 4a-epi-nanaomycin B by treatment with sodium hydrosulfite in an acidic aqueous solution. 4a-epi-Nanaomycin B was quantiatively converted into nanaomycin A under alkaline conditions.
