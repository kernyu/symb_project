The aim of this work was to study drug resistance of M. tuberculosis to Streptomycin (SM), Isoniazid (INH), Ethambutol (EMB) and Rifampicin (RMP) in the department of the Bas-Rhin from 1971 to 1978. On 2,995 original culture plates which were positive, 1,561 antibiograms were performed at the C.E.R.P. The proportion of those tested has increased over the years from 27.8% in 1971 to 80.6% in 1978 because of the increasing number of laboratories participating in the study. The research is based on 1,511 cultures of M. tuberculosis and the population was split into two groups: 1,386 untreated subjects or treated for less than 15 days (primary resistance) and 125 subjects who had already been treated (acquired resistance). Over all the years, primary resistance to at least one drug was 6.9%. Primary resistance to SM was 3.0%, to INH 2.2% and to both 1.4% (the levels of primary resistance to EMB and RMP were practically nil). Acquired resistance to at least one of these antibiotics was 16.0% with the same order as for primary resistance: resistance to SM alone = 7.2%, to INH alone 4.0% and both together 2.4%. The proportions were greater than for primary resistance but concerned fewer subjects as only 8% of the population had been previously treated. There were no cases of primary or acquired resistance to Rifampicin alone.
