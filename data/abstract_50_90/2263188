In a space of 26 months 108 shigellas were isolated from 104 patients with sporadic and benign diseases. 90% of the subjects were young French. Both S. Dysenteriae and S. Boydii make up 21% of the strains studied. 13% of the germs are multiresistance. Multiresistance can enhance development of serious sickness if a virulent strain comes in.
