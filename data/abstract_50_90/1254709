Clinical isolates of rhamnose-positive Yersinia enterocolitica (Y.e.rh+) were compared with typical rhamnose-negative Y. enterocolitica (Y.e.rh-) and with Yersinia pseudotuberculosis. The Y.e.rh+ differed from the Y.e.rh- and Y. pseudotuberculosis in their ability to ferment raffinose and lactose, utilize citrate and in their inability to grow on Hektoen enteric agar at 22 or 37 C, on Salmonella-Shigella agar at 37 C, and scant on xylose-lysine-deoxycholate agar at 37 C. An extensive temperature-dependent profile of characteristics was established for the Y.e.rh+: motility, acetoin production, citrate utilization, growth on Salmonella-Shigella agar, and ampicillin resistance occurred at 22 C but not 37 C; fermentation of melibiose, raffinose, and cellobiose occurred within 24 h at 22 C, but not before 5 days at 37 C; fermentation of rhamnose and production of beta-galactosidase occurred within 24 h at 22 C, but not before 48 h at 37 C; greater resistance to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, streptomycin, kanamycin, carbenicillin, and gentamicin was observed at 22 than 37 C; and good growth on xylose-lysine-deoxycholate agar occurred at 22 but not 37 C. For optimal recovery of Y.e.rh+ from mixed culture, e.g., stools, two MacConkey plates should be inoculated and incubated, one at 37 C, and one at 22 C. Lactose-negative colonies appearing after 48 h on the 22 C MacConkey agar but not the 37 C MacConkey agar should be considered possible Y.e.rh+. Biochemicals should be tested in duplicate, one set incubated at 22 C, one set at 37 C. Antibiotic susceptibility tests of Y.e.rh+ isolates should be incubated at both 37 C and at a lower temperature to allow the greatest expression of resistance of these organisms to the various antibiotics.
