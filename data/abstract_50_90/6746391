Twenty-three isolations of Serratia spp were made from 21 horses at the University of Florida Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital between Jan 1, 1979 and July 1, 1983. Three Serratia spp were involved in single-organism and mixed infections of various tissues. Eight horses of this group died. All horses that died had massive, mixed, gram-negative infection. The other 13 responded to treatment, including systemic antibiotic therapy. Most of these horses were stressed and under antibiotic therapy prior to the time of culture. Possible nosocomial infection, variable antibiotic sensitivity, and a trend toward decreased antibiotic sensitivity after antibiotic administration were noted.
