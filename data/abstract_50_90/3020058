A rapid and sensitive colorimetric assay has been developed to evaluate the sensitivity of herpes simplex viruses (HSV) to antiviral agents. The chessboard titration of viruses and antiviral drugs and the automatic reading and analysis of the data allows objective and accurate results to be rapidly obtained. Virus sensitivity was expressed as an ED50 value which was the concentration of drug (micrograms/ml) reducing viral cpe by 50%. The ED50 values of antiviral drugs [acetylguanosine (ACV), idoxuridine (IDU), deoxycytidine (IDC) and bromovinyl deoxyuridine] for several HSV reference strains were determined and the method was then applied to clinical specimens. The selection of ACV and IDU resistant mutants was performed on a cloned sensitive HSV 1 ocular strain. We observed cross-resistance between ACV and IDU for the mutants isolated. The resistance to thymidine-kinase-dependent antiviral agents varied in inverse ratio to the thymidine kinase activity induced by HSV strains.
