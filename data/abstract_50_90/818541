In 300 strains of the Klebsiella-Enterobacter group which were isolated from pathological material from the Bonn University Hospitals in early 1975, the sensitivity to tobramycin was investigated comparatively in a serial dilution test and agar diffusion test. 80% of the strains were seen to be classifiable as sensitive and further 3% as moderately sensitive. The rate to resistance corresponds to that of gentamycin. No difference in resistance behaviour was ascertained in the two bacterial species investigated. However, strains isolated from the urogenital tract are significantly more resistant than pathogens isolated from the respiratory tract.
