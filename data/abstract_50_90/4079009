Fundamental and clinical studies of cefpiramide (CPM, SM-1652) a new semisynthetic cephalosporin were carried out in the field of obstetrics and gynecology. The results were obtained as follows: In vitro antibacterial activity of CPM against recent 255 clinical isolates was compared with those of cefazolin (CEZ), cefmetazole (CMZ) and cefoperazone (CPZ). CPM showed strong antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus, K. pneumoniae, Peptococcus and Peptostreptococcus. However the minimum inhibitory concentration of CPM was inferior to those of CEZ, CMZ and CPZ against E. coli. The transfer of CPM to the female genital organs was found to be good. Tissue levels over than 5 micrograms/g were maintained after 5 hours. CPM was administered to 10 patients with obstetrical and gynecological infections. Good responses were obtained in all of the cases. Neither adverse reactions nor abnormal laboratory findings were observed except 1 case with slight elevation of BUN.
