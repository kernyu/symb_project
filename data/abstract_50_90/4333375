The ubiquinone precursor 2-octaprenyl-3-methyl-5-hydroxy-6-methoxy-1, 4-benzoquinone was isolated from two ubiquinone-deficient mutants of Escherichia coli and identified by nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectrometry. The results of genetic analysis of the mutants indicate that each mutant carries a mutation in a gene designated ubiG which was located, by cotransduction with the nalA and glpT genes, at minute 42 on the E. coli chromosome.
