Antibacterial activity of 14 drugs against clinical strains of asporogenic anaerobes causing wound infections in the soft tissues i. e. Bacteroides fragilis and Bacteroides melaninogenicus as well as anaerobic gram-positive++ cocci was assayed with the method of serial dilutions in agar. It was shown that among the investigated species B. fragilis had the most marked resistance since out of the 14 drugs only 8 were sufficiently active against it i.e. carbenicillin, levomycetin, lincomycin, dioxidine, metronidazole, thinidazole, nitrazole and erythromycin. The choice of drugs for treating infections caused by B. melaninogenicus and anaerobic grampositive cocci unlike those caused by B. fragilis offered no difficulty since practically++ all the investigated drugs were highly active against the causative agents. There was observed relationship between the frequency of asporogenic anaerobes and the wound genesis. The characteristic features of the species composition connected with localization of the suppurative foci were indicated. The detected specific antimicrobial profiles of the asporogenic anaerobes causing wound infections and the peculiarity of their participation in development of purulent infections of the soft tissues provided a differential approach to empirical antibacterial therapy prior to the pathogen bacteriological investigation and availability of the antibioticograms.
