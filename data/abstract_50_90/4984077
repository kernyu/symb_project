Treatment with urea-mercaptoethanol of purified spores of Bacillus thuringiensis, other Bacillus species, and Clostridium roseum solubilizes a protein fraction between 5 and 12% of the dry weight of the spores. This fraction behaves identically to the crystal protein of B. thuringiensis on acrylamide-gel electrophoresis. The protein from all of the Bacillus species shows partial homology with crystal protein, using the Ouchterlony immunodiffusion technique. A further fraction, similar in amount, can be removed from spores of B. thuringiensis by the addition of sodium lauryl sulfate to the urea-mercaptoethanol. Spores of B. thuringiensis extracted in these ways show no difference when compared to untreated spores with respect to viability or resistance to heat and ultraviolet-irradiation. The extracted spores do show differences in their germination requirements and their susceptibility to phase-darkening by lysozyme. It is concluded that an urea-mercaptoethanol-soluble protein or class of protein is a widespread component of bacterial spores, possibly located in the spore coat, and that this protein may be related to the crystal protein of B. thuringiensis.
