The authors have carried during one year, in the hospital of Villeneuve-Saint-Georges, a prospective study on 229 cases of pneumococcal infections with bacteriological findings. They emphazise the frequency, the high-exposed groups and the gravity of these infections despite of the antibiotherapy. The emergence of multiply resistant pneumococcus makes out another argument for proposing a preventive vaccination taking notice of the most frequent serotypes found in France.
