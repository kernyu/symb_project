Studies on ultrastructure of drug-resistant strains of Plasmodium berghei have been mostly restricted to the experimentally selected chloroquine and pyrimethamine resistant strains. Study of the morphology of mefloquine and quinine resistant strain of P. berghei has been carried out to demonstrate some differences between normal and drug-resistant strains. The main differences are concerned with a complex physiological process i.e., food ingestion and digestion. E.M. studies reveal that in the sensitive strain of P. berghei the trophozoites possess numerous rod-shaped malarial pigment particles which lie within a vesicle. In the trophozoites of resistant parasites the malarial pigment particles are rarely visible. Trophozoites of the sensitive strain have only one large food vacuole while the trophozoite of the resistant parasite contains 2-3 smaller vacuoles.
