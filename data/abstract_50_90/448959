Erythromycin has been reported to be active in vitro against most anaerobic bacteria. We found it effective in treating 14 of 17 patients with mild to moderately severe anaerobic or mixed aerobic/anaerobic pleuropulmonary of soft-tissue infections when adjunctive measures (eg, drainage, debridement, and the use of additional antibiotics to treat important aerobic pathogens) were employed. Erythromycin offers a reasonable therapeutic alternative to penicillin in the treatment of a penicillin-allergic patient who has a mild or moderately severe anaerobic or mixed aerobic/anaerobic infection not involving Bacteroides fragilis or fusobacteria.
