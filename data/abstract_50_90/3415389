Eremomycin is an original natural antibiotic with glycopeptide structure isolated at the Institute of New Antibiotics, the USSR Academy of Medical Sciences. Activity of eremomycin alone or in combination with tobramycin was studied with using 25 clinical strains of staphylococci. 56 and 88 per cent of the strains were respectively resistant to gentamicin and kanamycin, two aminoglycoside antibiotics. All the staphylococcal strains were sensitive to eremomycin in concentrations of 0.12 to 1 microgram/ml. The MIC of tobramycin for 10 (40 per cent) sensitive strains ranged within 0.25-2 micrograms/ml. For 60 per cent of the strains the MIC was equal to or higher than 16 micrograms/ml. When eremomycin was used in combination with tobramycin the antibacterial effect with respect to 17 strains (68 per cent) increased. In 32 per cent of the strains the effect was synergistic and in 36 per cent of the strains it was additive. Indifference and antagonism were detected with respect to 7 (28 per cent) and 1 (4% per cent) strains respectively. No significant difference was shown in manifestation of the synergistic-additive nature of eremomycin and tobramycin interaction with respect to the tobramycin sensitive and resistant strains.
