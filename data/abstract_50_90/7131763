A new aminoglycoside antibiotic, fortimicin, was administered intramuscularly to 3 patients (panperitonitis). Clinical response was excellent in 2 cases and good in 1 case. The effective rate was 100%. In these patients, fortimicin was given in a dose of 600 mg, 2 or 3 times daily for 6 to 7 days. No adverse effect was observed. Therefore fortimicin was suggested to be a useful drug for the treatment of panperitonitis.
