The Institut Marchoux animal research unit report of activities 1982-1984 shows increasing results in mouse-foods-pads inoculations. Among 17 multibacillary cases, 16 were clinically dapsone-resistant suspected. In 9 cases there was no multiplication; however in 4 cases, multiplication were observed in the untreated controled mice group but no multiplication in dapsone groups. Three cases were fully dapsone-resistant in all concentrations tested. In one case we have detected a partial DDS resistance. No multiplication in the mice group with 10(-2) dapsone dict, but multiplication in 10(-3) and 10(-4) dapsone dict.
