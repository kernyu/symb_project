Neutrophilic polymorphonuclear leukocytes (NPNL) are an important part of the protection system of higher animals against infection and related with specific immune response taking part in immediate and delayed type hypersensitivity reactions and affecting some parameters of mononuclear phagocytes and lymphocytes. Among bactericidal mechanisms of NPNL, neutral proteases and nonenzymatic cation proteins are particularly important. NPNL have fine autoregulation mechanisms among which of special importance is the synthesis of biologically active substances: leukotrienes, including a slow acting anaphylaxis substance, prostaglandins, and prostacyclins. These metabolites of arachidonic acid affect chemotropism of NPNL, phagocytosis activity, and secretion processes. The real activity of NPNL bactericidal mechanisms is determined by the following factors: (1) the state of genetically programmed structural-functional parameters common to NPNL, (2) the state of autoregulation mechanisms of NPNL function, (3) the stage of the infectious process, (4) NPNL--macrophage-lymphocyte system interaction, (5) regulatory effect of the neurohumoral and endocrine systems, (6) serum factors of nonspecific resistance, (7) characteristics of the causative agent of infection.
