Amikacin (BB-K8) is a semisynthetic derivative of kanamycin which is active in vitro against many gentamicin-resistant Gram-negative bacilli. Twenty-three patients with 25 serious Gram-negative infections were treated with this new aminoglycoside. Twelve infections involved organisms that were resistant to gentamicin. Twenty patients satisfied the criteria for bacteriological and clinical cure. This included 11 of the 12 infections involving gentamicin-resistant Gram-negative bacilli. In 4 urinary tract infections there was a good clinical response, but routine follow-up urine cultures at 30 days were positive. One patient failed on amikacin therapy. Eighth nerve toxicity was detected in two patients. These results indicate that amikacin is effective in the treatment of serious Gram-negative infections and is particularly useful in those involving resistant organisms. Further studies are indicated to evaluate ototoxic potential.
