Seven polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly I-poly C) preparations, ranging from 4.2 S to 21.2 S, prepared from various sizes of polyinosinate and polycytidylate, were examined for toxicity and interferon-inducing activity in mice. The increase in size of poly I-poly C was accompanied by increases both in the maximal amount of interferon produced and in the length of persistence of a high level of interferon in plasma. Toxicity of poly I-poly C was proportional to the molecular size within the range of 8 S to 16 S. The amount of interferon induced by 1/5 LD50 of poly I-poly C depended on the size of the inducer, being increasingly lower with progressively smaller sizes. Next, activities of poly I-poly C in culture cells were examined. The resistance-inducing activity of poly I-poly C in primary chick embryo cells (CEC) increased with the size of the inducer (4.2 S to 11.6 S), whereas the activity in L cells was not so markedly dependent upon its molecular size as in CEC. In the presence of calf serum during induction of resistance the activity was lowered. The activities of preparations with small molecular sizes were affected by calf serum more markedly than those of large molecular sizes. The interferon-inducing activity in RK13 was not appreciably influenced by the size of poly I-poly C, especially in the presence of DEAE-dextran, while the activity in L cells was markedly dependent upon the size of the inducer. These results suggest that the influence of the molecular size of poly I-poly C upon the resistance-inducing and interferon-inducing activities varies among different kinds of cells, and alters in the presence of serum or DEAE-dextran.
