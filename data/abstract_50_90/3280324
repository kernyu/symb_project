Recurrent episodes of salmonellosis, including recurrent life-threatening bacteremias, have been well-described in patients with AIDS. Because of the need to avoid sensitization to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SFX) in AIDS patients and the high frequency of ampicillin resistance of Salmonella isolates, alternative therapies must be sought. We report the treatment of nine AIDS patients, who had recurrent salmonellosis, with norfloxacin, a new oral fluoroquinolone which has excellent in vivo activity against Salmonella sp. Each patient had two to three prior distinct clinical episodes of salmonellosis which had failed to be eradicated with standard courses of ampicillin, TMP-SFX, ceftriaxone or cefotaxime. Microbiologic relapse had occurred in each patient within 2-4 weeks. Each of the enteric pathogens was susceptible in vitro to norfloxacin. Patients were treated with norfloxacin 400 mg bid orally for 30 days. Stool cultures were negative at 1 week in all patients. Nausea and headache were the only adverse reactions to norfloxacin noted. One patient had a clinical and microbiologic relapse of Salmonella 1 week after norfloxacin was stopped but responded to retreatment with norfloxacin. Norfloxacin appears effective in the treatment of enteric infections in AIDS patients and may be more useful than standard agents in eradicating the organism and preventing clinical and microbiologic relapse. Oral administration and twice daily dosing are significant advantages.
