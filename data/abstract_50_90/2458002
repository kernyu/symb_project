Terrilytin and immobilized terrilytin enhance the activity and intensity of phagocytosis and increase the concentration of lysozyme in nonimmunized animals. Both preparations increase the production of antibodies to staphylococcal alpha-hemolysin, the titers of beta-lysins, the activity and intensity of the phagocytosis of bacterial cells by peripheral blood leukocytes in animals immunized with staphylococcal toxoid and challenged with live staphylococcal culture. In healthy animals terrilytin and immobilized terrilytin induce an increase in total proteolytic activity and in the activity of alpha-1-antitrypsin and alpha-2-macroglobulin, decreased as the result of staphylococcal infection.
