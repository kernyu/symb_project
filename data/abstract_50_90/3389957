Toxicity of eremomycin was studied after its multiple parenteral administration to albino rats, guinea pigs and dogs in doses equivalent by the body surface to the daily doses for humans i. e. 1 and 3 g. The antibiotic was administered for 1 to 6 months. Tolerance of the antibiotic by the dogs after intravenous and intramuscular administration was satisfactory. In some animals there were observed an insignificant increase in the activity of alanine aminotransferase and a rise in the level of urea in blood serum. Pathomorphological examination of the internal organs of the albino rats and dogs showed that in high doses the antibiotic could have a damaging effect on the kidneys and epithelium of the gastrointestinal tract. The level of the damages depended on the dose of the antibiotic and duration of its use. The damages induced by eremomycin were reversible. It had no marked effect on the peripheral blood count, coagulation system and erythrocyte resistance. In the tested doses the antibiotic had no unfavourable effect on the hearing function in the experiments with guinea pigs. Studies with rats revealed that eremomycin had no teratogenic effect. A slightly pronounced embryotoxic action was observed only after using the antibiotic in doses exceeding more than 12 times the approximate therapeutic dose.
