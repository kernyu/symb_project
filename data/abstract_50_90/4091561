Plasmids were visualized in strains of Lactobacillus plantarum by use of a rapid method. Plasmids pIP501 and pAM beta 1 were transferred by conjugation from Streptococcus strains to Lactobacillus plantarum, and recipient strains were shown to act as donors in crosses to S. lactis. Attempts to transfer these plasmids between strains of L. plantarum were not successful.
