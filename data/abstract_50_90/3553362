A case of borderline lepromatous leprosy with a history of 5 years duration of disease, was first seen in 1971 and treated with graded doses of dapsone in the OP Clinic of the Institute. He became inactive and bacteriologically negative in 3 years. While continuing on dapsone therapy he relapsed into active dapsone resistant leprosy 3 1/2 years later. He was admitted in the hospital and given Rifampicin 600 mg. daily for 15 days along with dapsone 100 mg. daily. He again became inactive and bacteriologically negative within 3 years. 3 years later under regular dapsone therapy he relapsed again for the second time into active BT leprosy, but remained bacteriologically negative. He was given 3 drug regimen subsequently and became clinically inactive within 15 months.
