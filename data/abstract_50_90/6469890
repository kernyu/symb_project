Combination of rifampicin with trimethoprim, erythromycin, tetracycline or fusidic acid have some desirable features in the treatment of difficult infections. They are active against a very wide range of possible pathogens. Resistance to rifampicin is rare. Such combinations may be bactericidal and may be usefully synergistic. They may prevent or delay the emergence of bacterial resistant seen when some single agents are used. They can be used in patients with penicillin hypersensitivity. A series of life-threatening infections has been treated with rifampicin-containing combinations. The infections included endocarditis, meningitis, pneumonia, Legionnaire's disease, and head and neck sepsis. A major reason for the choice of drug was often penicillin hypersensitivity. A second reason was the presumption (mostly subsequently confirmed) that streptococci and/or staphylococci were implicated. The clinical outcome of these infections was generally satisfactory, with few side effects and little evidence of the emergence of antibiotic resistance.
