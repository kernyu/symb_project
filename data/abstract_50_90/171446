Pox-1, a mutant of Salmonella typhimurium, strongly channels P22 toward lysogeny. Viral DNA synthesis in this slow-growing mutant is delayed to a greater extent than viral protein synthesis. The relative enhancement of c2 repressor synthesis results in much higher repressor/DNA synthesis ratios in Pox-1 than in wild-type cells. This probably accounts for the high frequency of lysogenization.
