Thirty independently derived reference strains and clinical isolates of Pasteurella multocida were tested to determine their potential for acquiring adaptive resistance to oxytetracycline in an effort to better understand the prolonged high efficacy of the antibiotic for pasteurellosis in poultry. All reference strains and clinical isolates exhibited uniform susceptibility as measured with the broth dilution method. None of the strains or isolates readily acquired significant resistance when grown in subinhibitory oxytetracycline levels under the conditions employed. These data support the conclusions that spontaneous variation in P. multocida resulting in oxytetracycline resistance is uncommon in the field and that the organism possesses a very low propensity for acquiring adaptive resistance in response to growth in the presence of the antibiotic.
