Acellular systems of synthesis of polyphenylalanin containing the supernatant fraction from E. coli B and ribosomes from an oxytetracycline sensitive strain of E. coli and strains resistant to that antibiotic were almost equally sensitive to oxytetracycline. The supernatant fraction from the cells of E. coli 241, a resistant strain absorbing significant amounts of oxytetracycline lowered the inhibiting effect of oxytetracycline in the acellular systems of protein synthesis (with an endogenic matrix). No fermentative inactivation of oxytetracycline by that fraction was found with both the biological and radiochromatographic methods.
