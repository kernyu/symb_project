The effects of cefbuperazone (CBPZ) on the morphology of Escherichia coli in the urine of 10 patients with acute simple cystitis were studied by differential interference contrast microscopy and electron microscopy. The urine specimens were collected via catheter before, 5, 10, 15 and 30 minutes after intravenous administration of 0.25 g CBPZ. The minimum inhibitory concentrations for 8 Escherichia coli strains isolated from 8 patients against CBPZ were from 0.05 to 0.2 mcg/ml except one strain. The mean urinary concentrations at 5, 10, 15 and 30 minutes after administration of CBPZ were 274.8, 1181.5, 1343.4 and 931.5 mcg/ml, respectively. Urinalysis improved within 30 minutes after the administration. Filamentous cells of Escherichia coli were observed until 30 minutes after the administration. They had vacuole-like, and spheroplast and bulge formation were also observed in tested cases. CBPZ is suggested to have a high affinity for penicillin-binding protein (PBP) 3 and moderate affinity for PBP 1b and PBP 1a.
