Asymptomatic gonorrhea is significantly common in both males and females. A patient with one sexually transmitted disease (STD) is more likely to have an asymptomatic gonorrheal infection. A physician seeing a patient with an STD should obtain a culture for Neisseria gonorrhoeae to check for a possible asymptomatic infection. Routine culturing of this sexually active population will help to control the increasing incidence of gonorrhea. Appropriate treatment should be initiated by the physician who makes the diagnosis of gonorrhea.
