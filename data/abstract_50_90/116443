This paper deals with special conditions for testing the sporocidal effect of disinfectants. A method for the production of spore suspensions (Fig. 1) and the negative influence of heating to its resistance against disinfectants was described (Fig. 2). It was shown that spores of a non-virulent strain of Bac. anthracis could be used for this procedure (Fig. 3). In performing the suspension--and the germ-carrier test it was necessary to watch the effect of postinhibition and of inactivators. The application of 10 microliter disposible loops in the suspension-test was recommended. Since the test for the evaluation of the influence of organic matter on the results of disinfection was unreliable (Fig. 4), it was proposed to replace it by invention of a safety-factor. The germ-carrier test should be done with constant amounts of spores, dried to the surface under defined conditions. Exposition of germ-carriers to disinfectants should be done in a chamber with constant temperature and rel. humidity, since the results are strongly influenced by these factors (Fig. 5).
