Resistance to beta-lactam drugs is usually determined by genes mediating the production of beta-lactamases. These genes can be located on resistance plasmids or on the chromosome. Resistance to drugs which have been available for many years is mostly transposable. Although the origin of these genes is not known, it is possible to draw a hypothetical flow diagram of the evolution of resistance genes in general. The mechanism of resistance although mediated in Gram-negative bacteria mostly by beta-lactamases cannot be simply described as the hydrolytic function of the enzyme. It is a complex interaction involving the affinity of the drug for the target and the lactamase, the amount of drug in the periplasmic space, the amount of enzyme and the number of lethal target sites. Usually one of these factors is predominant.
