Five hundred and twenty seven strains of Staphylococcus aureus with massive contamination of at least 10(3) when estimated quantitatively were tested for their sensitivity to antibiotics and chloramine B. The staphylococcal strains were isolated from patients, air and stock of rooms in medical institutions, from medical personnel and healthy persons having no long-term contacts with hospital media i. e. from pregnant women and workers of confectionery plants. Among the isolates there were strains simultaneously sensitive to antibiotics and chloramine B (16.6 per cent), sensitive to antibiotics but resistant to chloramine B (5.5 per cent), resistant to antibiotics but sensitive to chloramine B (63.1 per cent) and resistant to antibiotics and chloramine B (15.3 per cent). Staphylococci resistant simultaneously to antibiotics and chloramine B were isolated from the persons of all the groups and from the air and stock of the rooms in the medical institutions. This showed the necessity of controlling sensitivity or staphylococci circulating in hospital media not only to antibiotics but also to disinfectants for providing more efficient prophylaxis of intrahospital infections.
