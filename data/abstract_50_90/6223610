Plasmid pJP4 encoding the ability to degrade the herbicide 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (Tfd+) was transferred by conjugation from Escherichia coli JMP397 to various lithoautotrophic strains of Alcaligenes eutrophus and to the autotrophic bacterium Pseudomonas oxalaticus. The herbicide-degrading function of the plasmid was phenotypically expressed in all of the recipients. The majority of Tfd+ transconjugants also exhibited additional plasmid-encoded properties such as 3-chlorobenzoate degradation, resistance to mercuric ions, and sensitivity to the male-specific bacteriophage PR11. Furthermore, Tfd+ transconjugants were able to act as donors of plasmid pJP4. Physical evidence is presented by agarose gel electrophoresis showing that plasmid pJP4 coexisted with the resident plasmids widely distributed in this group of bacteria. However, in some of the hosts plasmids pJP4 was not stably maintained, had a reduced size and tended to form multimers.
