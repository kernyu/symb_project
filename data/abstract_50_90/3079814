Adoptive immunization of T cell-deficient recipient mice with M. tuberculosis-specific memory immune T lymphocytes conferred upon these animals the ability to express significantly enhanced resistance both to the homologous infection, and to three strains of nontuberculous mycobacteria. These results support the hypothesis, therefore, that antigenic determinants possessed by the four mycobacterial strains that are relevant to the generation of protective cellular immunity are identical or closely crossreactive.
