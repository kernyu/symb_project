It is frequently assumed that, in general, combinations of antibiotics and similar chemotherapeutic agents are more efficient than the single chemotherapeutic, and that they can be combined without disadvantages for the activity of the single component. However, the specific properties of the combined substances, such as their antimicrobial spectrum and resistance, their pharmacokinetics and side effects, as well as their physical properties and formulation, have an enormous impact on the activity of combined chemotherapeutics. They may lead to an advantageous, but also to an indifferent or diminished activity of the combination in patients. Some of the important requirements for an advantageous combination of antibiotics and similarly functioning compounds will be reviewed and ways of avoiding mistakes are described.
