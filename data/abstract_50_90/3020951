Using strict diagnostic criteria, a clinical trial of cefoxitin as the only antimicrobial agent in the treatment of twenty-five cases of septic abortion was carried out. The success rate of 77% (seventeen out of twenty-two) was significant in this group of seriously ill patients of low social class. Presence of pelvic abscess does not seem to preclude the use of cefoxitin. While the infections were of mixed bacterial flora, anaerobes were the predominant organisms isolated. Most organisms isolated were sensitive to cefoxitin but Pseudomonas aeruginosa was markedly resistant. No untoward reactions were observed. It appears that cefoxitin was successful as a single agent in the treatment of septic abortion.
