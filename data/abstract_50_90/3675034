The activity of ivermectin was examined in Necator americanus, a human hookworm, adapted to the laboratory hamster. A dose of 30 mg kg-1 X 1 or 10 mg kg-1 X 2 was required for complete clearance of pre-adult N. americanus; however, hamsters carrying adult N. americanus were completely cured of infection by doses of 15 mg kg-1 or 7.5 mg kg-1 X 2. The doses of ivermectin required for complete elimination of N. americanus were much higher than those reported for other intestinal nematodes. The probable reasons for these higher doses are discussed. Tests were also carried out with other rodent parasites, namely Nematospiroides dubius, Strongyloides ratti and Trichuris muris. Doses as low as 0.3 mg kg-1 X 1 completely eliminated adult N. dubius from mice, whereas++ S. ratti needed a repeated dose (0.3 mg kg-1 X 2). None of the mice was cured of T. muris infection even at doses of 10 mg kg-1 X 2, although some degree of cure was apparent at the toxic dose. It thus appears that ivermectin is in no way superior in its activity against N. americanus and T. muris than the existing anthelmintics.
