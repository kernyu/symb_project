Thirty-seven patients with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections and/or colonization were treated with oral ciprofloxacin (750 mg twice a day). Clinical cure or improvement of infections occurred in 91% of the patients, and bacteriologic cure occurred in 60%. Ciprofloxacin therapy suppressed methicillin-resistant S. aureus colonization in 55% of the patients. Ciprofloxacin-resistant strains emerged in 6 of the 37 patients.
