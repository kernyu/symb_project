The drug sensitivity of seven Trypanosoma vivax-isolates from Kenya and Somalia was examined. With the exception of diminazene aceturate all commercially available trypanocidal drugs failed to effect a cure. The results suggest the existence of multiple drug resistance of T. vivax-strains, geographically widely distributed along the East African Coast. The isolates were resistant to the recommended dose rates of isometamidium, homidium and quinapyramine. Isometamidium showed no prophylactic properties when tested against one of the isolates. All were sensitive to diminazene aceturate.
