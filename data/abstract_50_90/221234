Some effects of cAMP on replication of Semliki Forest Virus in chick embryo fibroblast cell cultures are described. Depending on concentration, the incorporation of [3H]-uridine into viral RNA or the formation of plaque-forming units is inhibited; the highest concentration tested was 8 mM. Cyclic AMP has an effect of its own and increases the Interferon action in the lower concentration ranges of Interferon (up to 1 unit/ml). The effect of cyclic AMP is fast, needs no induction and is also visible in late phases of viral replication. However, these experiments do not establish a causal relation between cAMP and Interferon.
