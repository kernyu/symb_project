The authors report on a tuberculous infection at an unusual location, caused by trauma in the region of the transverse process of the second lumbar vertebra. The pathogen was identified as mycobacterium fortuitum. This is a conditionally pathogenic, atypical mycobacterium of Group IV, the rapidly-growing mycobacteria. It is distinguished by its primary resistance to almost all tuberculostatica. The treatment of choice is therefore the radical surgical removal of the tuberculous focus. Since tuberculosis of a spinous process has not yet been described, the authors have termed this disease spondylitis tuberculosa lateralis.
