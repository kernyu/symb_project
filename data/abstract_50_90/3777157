By removing the shell membranes from the chorioallantoic membrane, the chorion is damaged, as visualized by electron microscopy, and rendered permeable, as evidenced by penetration of horseradish peroxidase and increased inhibition of the allantoic Na+-K+ pump by ouabain applied on the chorionic side. The short-circuit current (SCC) of this functionally isolated allantoic epithelium is augmented by nystatin, a channel-forming ionophore, when applied to the mucosal surface. Electrical parameters were determined for three age groups between 12 and 19 days of incubation. The SCC approximately doubled from the youngest (12-13 days) to the oldest (18-19 days) groups, whereas the transepithelial resistance (Re) of 700-900 omega X cm2 remained the same. Amiloride, an inhibitor of apical Na+ uptake, inhibited 98-100% of the SCC at 10(-4) M in both 15-16 and 18-19 day epithelia. In the 12- to 13-day preparation 20-25% of the SCC was insensitive to 10(-3) M amiloride. The Ki's for amiloride were similar in all preparations, at about 5 X 10(-7) M. Determination of the Hill coefficients for inhibition revealed a lower value (0.75 +/- 0.03) for the 12-13 day preparation compared with the two older preparations with coefficients not significantly different from unity. Replacing Na+ in the bathing solutions abolished the SCC of 18-19 day epithelia, whereas about 15% of the SCC remained at 12-13 days. Thus, during development, the SCC of the allantoic epithelium increases in magnitude and becomes increasingly (to 100%) amiloride-sensitive and Na+-dependent.
