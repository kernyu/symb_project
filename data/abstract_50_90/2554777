The antiviral activity of bromovinyldeoxyuridine has been studied on the wild type of pseudorabies virus. A heterogenicity of viral populations has been observed. A resistant clone presented special characteristics both in vitro (large syncytia, round cells) and in vivo (reduced pathogenicity and immunogenic power).
