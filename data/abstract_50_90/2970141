We have used limiting dilution analysis to study the behavior of alloantigen-reactive cytolytic T lymphocytes derived from human peripheral blood. During these studies, we found that the presence of cyclosporine in limiting dilution microcultures significantly impairs the subsequent development of alloantigen-reactive cytolytic T cell activity. As a result, CsA reduces the estimate of CTL precursor frequency by limiting dilution analysis. CTL frequency estimates are reduced by CsA in a dose-dependent manner, and concentrations of CsA that are readily achieved in human peripheral blood (100-1000 ng/ml) are capable of reducing estimates of CTL frequency by 90% to 100%. Further studies revealed that (1) human CTL derived either from fresh peripheral blood or from primary mixed lymphocyte cultures are sensitive to the suppressive effects of cyclosporine in limiting dilution microcultures, indicating that CsA influences both alloantigen-primed CTL and CTL precursors; (2) CsA impairs an immunologic event or events, that occurs for at least the first four days of limiting dilution microculture incubation; (3) CsA-mediated suppression is eliminated by separation of CTL from cyclosporine; (4) CsA blocks development of CTL generation, but not cell proliferation in limiting dilution microcultures; and (5) the CsA-mediated suppression is not reversed by supraoptimal concentrations of IL-2, high concentrations of gamma-IFN, or supplementation with the multiple lymphokines present in MLC supernatants. These data suggest that CsA may have a direct inhibitory influence on the differentiation of human CTL precursors that is independent of helper T cell dysfunction.
