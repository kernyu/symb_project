Antibacterial drug resistance among 219 salmonella isolates recovered during 1974 from poultry and poultry environments at the various production stages of broiler chickens in three integrated Ontario companies are recorded. All isolates were susceptible to ampicillin, trimethroprim-sulfamethoxazole complex, furazolidone, cephaloridine and amoxicillin. A relative increase in resistance to tetracycline and streptomycin with an accompanying decrease in resistance to triple sulfa compound was recorded when compared to a previous investigation of avian salmonella isolates in Ontario. The percentage and patterns of antimicrobial resistance were comparable at the various stages of production. Resistance to tetracycline and streptomycin was the most common pattern found among both Salmonella typhimurium and other serotypes. A notably high prevalence of resistance was found among Salmonella enteritidis isolates including some isolates with R factors for chloramphenicol resistance. This latter finding is of particular concern because of the high prevalence of this serotype in poultry and in human salmonellosis.
