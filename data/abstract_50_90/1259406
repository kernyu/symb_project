The in vitro antibacterial effects of cefoxitin, a semisynthetic cephamycin, cefuroxime, a new cephalosporin antibiotic, and cephaloridine were compared. With gram-positive bacteria, marked differences were found only in the effects against Streptococcus faecalis, where cephaloridine and cefuroxime were superior to cefoxitin. With gram-negative aerobic bacteria, cefoxitin, which is known to be more resistant to beta-lactamases from gram-negative bacteria than any cephalosporin, was found to be more effective than cefuroxime and cephaloridine against ampicillin-resistant strains of Escherichia coli and indole-positive strains of Proteus. Haemophilus influenzae was found to be more susceptible to cefuroxime than to cefoxitin and cephaloridine. When ampicillin-resistant strains of H. influenzae were tested, markedly higher minimal inhibitory concentration values were obtained with cephaloridine in comparison to those obtained with ampicillin-susceptible strains. These increases in the minimal inhibitory concentration values were not observed with cefoxitin and cefuroxime, probably due to the resistance of these two compounds to beta-lactamases. Strains of Bacteroides fragilis were found to be much more susceptible to cefoxitin than to cefuroxime, which in turn was superior to cephaloridine. The results obtained indicate that cefoxitin and cefuroxime both are superior in their antibacterial spectra to the cephalosporins that are now in clinical use.
