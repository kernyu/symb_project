Fifty-five documented infections reported from an admission unit of a large skilled nursing facility (SNF) during a five-month period were analyzed. Of these, 45 (82 percent) were urinary-tract infections (UTIs), chiefly asymptomatic bacteriuria. Sixty-three percent of the UTIs were acquired in the SNF, and the remainder were acquired during the preceding stay in a general hospital. Statistically, Proteus species infections were more common among the SNF-acquired UTIs, whereas Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections were the most common among the hospital-acquired UTIs. The following recommendations are made: 1) for previously hospitalized elderly patients in whom urinary-tract sepsis develops soon after admission to an SNF, treatment should start with an antibiotic active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa while the results of cultures are pending; 2) symptomatic lower urinary-tract infections caused by SNF-acquired Proteus species should be treated with nalidixic acid or trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole; 3) the term "nosocomial infection" should be broadened to include infections acquired in long-term care institutions; and 4) infection surveillance should be started in selected long-term care institutions for the elderly as part of an expanded National Nosocomial Infections Survey.
