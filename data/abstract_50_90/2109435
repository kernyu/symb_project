In laboratory tests with carriers (glass, slab, blanket) at a high rel. humidity (95%) the survival was distinctly reduced by S. aureus at 37 degrees C and by Ps. aeruginosa at 21 degrees C and 37 degrees C. Against this after 24 h storing of contaminated carriers (glass) the resistance to disinfectants was higher at 95% rel. humidity as at 35% rel. humidity.
