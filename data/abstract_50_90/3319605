Relative tolerance of Escherichia coli strains to Cd2+ is induced by prior growth in medium containing low levels of either Cd2+ or Hg2+, and maximal induction appears to be dependent upon recA+ function. Biosynthesis of glutathione is not required for induction or for expression of induced resistance. Salmonella typhimurium strains are relatively resistant to Cd2+, and this resistance is essentially constitutive.
