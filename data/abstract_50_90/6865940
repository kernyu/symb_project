Starting with hybrid cell lines between a Chinese hamster cell EmtA mutant and a Chinese hamster cell EmtB mutant, we have constructed cell lines that are homozygous for mutant alleles at both the emtA locus and the emtB locus, by using a two-step segregation protocol. The EmtA EmtB double mutants are approximately 10-fold more resistant to emetine inhibition than either of the parental mutants. Having both the EmtA mutation and the EmtB mutation expressed in the same cell also results in a level of resistance to cryptopleurine that is significantly higher than a simple additive effect of the two mutations alone. Analysis of ribosomal proteins by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis demonstrated that a parental hybrid and a first-step segregant, which has lost the wild-type emtA allele, synthesize both a normal and an altered form of ribosomal protein S14, whereas an EmtA EmtB double mutant synthesizes only the altered form of this ribosomal protein. This result confirms that the emtB locus is the structural gene for ribosomal protein S14. Our results also suggest that the products of the emtA and emtB loci interact directly, indicating that the emtA locus, like the emtB locus, encodes a component of the ribosome.
