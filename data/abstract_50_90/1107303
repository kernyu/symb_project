A plasmid, derived from a naturally occurring strain of Proteus mirabilis, conferred resistance to cephalosporins, apparently mediated by a beta-lactamase indistinguishable from that determined by the chromosomal gene of Escherichia coli K-12. There was evidence for a recombination event between the wild-type plasmid and a defective F factor (Fsp) in the Escherichia coli K-12 culture in which it was stored.
