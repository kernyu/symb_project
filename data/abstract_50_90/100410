The various types of bacterial resistance (natural species resistance, chromosomal and plasmidic resistance) and their mechanisms are described. Thereafter, a survey on the resistance is given using investigations from different sources. The distribution of resistant strains dependent on the geographical location and the situation of the patients (ambulatory--hospitalized) is described, and the development of resistant strains in dependance of time is analyzed. Finally, the phenomena of resistance against aminoglycoside and beta-lactam antibiotics are explained in more detail.
