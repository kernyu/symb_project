From 120 Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains selected for their slight susceptibility to ceftazidime (MIC greater than or equal to 16 micrograms/ml) we studied the characteristics of beta-lactamases and their susceptibility to aminoglycoside and to beta-lactam antibiotics. The quantitative spectrum, chromosomic beta-lactamase hyperproduction and the isoelectric point of beta-lactamases were also studied as well as the MIC in solid medium, inoculum 5 x 10(4) cfu. About 14.7% of strains moderately susceptible to ceftazidime and 88.4% of those resistant, were hyperproducers of chromosomic beta-lactamases. All the strains were resistant to ureidopenicillins, cefotaxime and moxalactam, 55.8% to monobactams and 35% were also resistant to cefsulodine; all of them were susceptible to imipenem. In bacteria isolated from twelve patients a loss of susceptibility could be observed against ceftazidime and other beta-lactams. There was also an increase in chromosomic beta-lactamase production during the treatment with antibiotics.
