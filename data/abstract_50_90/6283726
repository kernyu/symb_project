Studies were carried out on the inhibiting activity of amantadine - 1-amino adamantine (1-AA) on the virus of swine transmissive gastroenteritis, Rakovski strain, in cell cultures of pig kidney and thyroid gland. The inhibiting agent was tested in concentration of 6.25 to 100 microgram/cm3. Parallel titrations with and without 1-AA (25, 50, and 100 microgram/cm3) were used to establish the maximum difference in the titers 2 lg. The effect of inhibition was manifested at minimum concentration of 1-AA (12.5 microgram/cm3), and increased up to a concentration of 100 microgram/cm3. Within the interval 12.5-25.00-50.00 microgram/cm3 the doubling of the concentration of the inhibitor led to the decrease in the virus titer by 1 lg. In experiments to follow up the dynamics of the virus growth in the course of four days with and without 1-AA at the rate of 100 microgram/cm3 at varying multiplicity of infecting (from 0.5 up to 0.00005) the transient differences between the titers rose to 4.5 lg, while the differences between the peak values of the titer rose up to 2.5 lg. By means of seven consecutive passage of two variants of the virus selected by their decrease or increase in sensitivity to the inhibiting agent no change in their sensitivity to 1-AA was achieved.
