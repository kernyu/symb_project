Pure cultures of Physarum gyrosum were grown on agar plates with autoclaved Escherichia coli suspensions as the growth medium. Portions of such agar, after growth of the slime mold, contained diffusible materials that inhibited the growth of Bacillus subtilis, B. cereus, E. coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Paper chromatography of extracts of such cultures revealed at least three different active fractions. Preliminary fractionations increased the specific activity by one order of magnitude, probably in part by removal of inactive material and in part by separating active components. The fractionations also demonstrated the multiplicity of the antibiotic activity. Fractions variously obtained always retarded the growth of the bacterial species listed above.
