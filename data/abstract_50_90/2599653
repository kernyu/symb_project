The in vivo activity of ciprofloxacin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa was studied in a septicemia model in neutropenic mice and compared to that of other antibiotics with established activity against P. aeruginosa. When given as a single agent, ciprofloxacin proved to be as effective as imipenem/cilastatin, whereas azlocillin and tobramycin were rather ineffective. After infection with higher challenge inocula, combinations of two (synergistic) antibiotics were more effective than single agent therapy in most instances. The combination of ciprofloxacin with azlocillin was at least as effective as that of imipenem/cilastatin with tobramycin. Selection of mutants with decreased sensitivity to ciprofloxacin occurred during therapy, however, post-therapy MICs of ciprofloxacin did not exceed a level of 1 mg/l and rises of MICs did not detrimentally influence treatment outcome. Taken together with the results of earlier studies, our data encourage the use of ciprofloxacin in gram-negative septicemia in neutropenic patients.
