It was shown that the conjugation system of Ps. aeruginosa PAO 2604 X PTO 629 rifr used for transfer of the plasmid markers of R-factor RPI was a convenient model for a number of genetic investigations (the rate of transfer of the antibiotic resistance markers was 2.2 X 10(-3) to 8.8 X 10(-5). 80.7 per cent of the exconjugants obtained from this crossing acquired all 3 resistance plasmid markers (carbenicillin tetracycline, neomycin). In 12 per cent of R+-exconjugants transfer of 2 or 1 resistance determinant of R-factor was observed. The use of the above conjugation system revealed the inhibitory effect of bonafton (an antiviral drug), acridine dyes (acrichin, metachrome orange), ethidium bromide and rifampicin. A possibility of intraspecies transfer of resistance plasmid markers was found in crosses Ps. aeruginosa PAO 2604 X X E. coli CSH--2 rifr and Ps. aeruginosa PAO 2604 X E. coli C600 rifr. Transfer of the resistance markers was observed in combinations of carbenicillin, tetracycline, neomycin (Cb, Tc, Nm), tetracycline (Tc) and carbenicillin (Cb).
