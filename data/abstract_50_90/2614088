We treated three patients of chlamydial pneumonia with OFLX, two patients were diagnosed as psittacosis and one as pneumonia associated with TWAR strain by serologic test. Three hundred mg of OFLX was orally administered three times per day and the duration of treatment was from seven to fourteen days, and we compared the clinical effectiveness of OFLX in three cases (mild: 1, moderate: 2) with that of MINO in eleven cases (mild: 3, moderate: 8), who were administered two hundred mg of MINO two times per day orally or intravenously. We isolated C. psittaci from three pet birds including case 2 and the in vitro activity of OFLX and MINO against three strains of C. psittaci was determined. Clinical effectiveness were observed and obtained results were as follows. 1) In OFLX group, three patients judged as "Good", and in MINO, one patient as "Excellent", ten as "Good". 2) The duration of pneumonic shadow was 9.33 +/- 3.21 in OFLX group, 10.3 +/- 3.50 in MINO group, and there was no significant difference between both groups. 3) The in vitro activity of OFLX and MINO against 3 strains was 0.78-1.56 micrograms/ml and 0.025 microgram/ml, respectively. From these results, it was concluded that OFLX was considered to be a useful antichlamydial agent in the treatment of mild or moderate cases of chlamydial pneumonia.
