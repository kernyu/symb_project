A bacteriological survey of the healthy Goldfish (Carassius auratus) demonstrated the frequent occurrence of A. hydrophila. The biochemical characters and the sensitivity to 29 chemiotherapics and 15 antiseptics of 50 fish originating strains were studied and compared with a number of strains, implicated in human pathology. The results of this study indicate a good agreement for the biochemical characters and the sensitivity to chemiotherapics between the fish and the human strains. Owing to this statement, the author suggests to bear in mind the potential hazard which could result in the introduction of ornamental fishes in the hospital environment.
