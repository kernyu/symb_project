The use of a potent antiinterferon serum has demonstrated the importance of the interferon response in host resistance to infection with herpes simplex virus (HSV). Inoculation of mice with potent antiinterferon globulin was associated with a very marked effect on the evolution of HSV disease, as shown by an acclerated appearance of signs of disease and death. In a total of seven experiments, i.v. administration of a sheep antimouse interferon globulin (titre 4 x 10(5)) resulted in the early appearance of disease and death, and increased the overall mortality due to HSV-1 strain F injected either i.p. or s.c. Comparable results were obtained with strain B-12. Twenty-five mice that had survived HSV inoculation (s.c. or i.p.) were injected with antiinterferon globulin 18 days after viral inoculation. In no instance did this treatment induce signs of HSV disease.
