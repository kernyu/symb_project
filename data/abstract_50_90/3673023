The oligonucleotide mapping technique and RNA-RNA hybridization revealed structural differences between the HA- and M-protein genes of two variants of influenza A FPV, remantadine-sensitive and remantadine-resistant ones. A quantitative estimation of the structural divergence of the two influenza FPV pairs of genes was carried out. The possible functional role of the differences in the structure of the HA- and M-protein genes of the two FPV variants is discussed.
