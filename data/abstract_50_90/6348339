T-1982 (cefbuperazone), a new injectable cephamycin antibiotic, was employed for bacterial infections in children, and the following results were obtained. 1. When administered intravenously at a dose of 20 mg/kg to a 6-year-old female child, serum levels were 62 micrograms/ml at 30 minutes, 39 micrograms/ml at 1 hour, 17.6 micrograms/ml at 2 hours, 6.8 micrograms/ml at 4 hours and 2.9 micrograms/ml at 6 hours with serum half-life (T 1/2) of 76 minutes. Urinary excretion rates were 41.0, 5.3% and 2.4% respectively at 0-2, 2-4 hours and 4-6 hours, and urinary levels were 820 micrograms/ml, 182 micrograms/ml and 310 micrograms/ml, respectively. The total urinary recovery within 6 hours was 48.7%. 2. A total of 11 cases of pediatric infections was treated with T-1982. The clinical efficacy evaluated for 9 cases, excluding 2 cases of non-bacterial infections, was as follows; excellent in 4, good in 1 out of 5 cases of pneumonia, good in 1 case of cervical purulent lymphadenitis, and excellent in 1, good in 1, poor in 1 out of 3 cases of urinary tract infection. 3. As side effect, mild diarrhea in 1 case and slight elevation of GOT, GPT in 2 cases were observed. 4. These results suggest that T-1982 is of good use for bacterial infections in children and the expected efficacy is obtained at a dose of 20 mg/kg 3 times a day.
