An analysis of the serological and biochemical typing results of 925 clinical isolates of klebsiella revealed that biotyping and serotyping of klebsiella could replace each other for epidemiological purposes. The combination of both typing methods provided even more epidemiological information in analysing clusters of particular serotypes and biotypes in time. Clustering serotypes, mainly of neonatal origin, were nearly uniformly more resistant to the antibiotics in common use than other serotypes. Biotyping as well as serotyping of klebsiella isolates recovered from environmental surveys in the neonatal ward showed that epidemic and non-epidemic klebsiella isolates could occasionally be cultured from the environment and from the staff.
