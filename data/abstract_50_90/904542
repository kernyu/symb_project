For prevention of bacteriemia caused by contaminated dialysis fluid it is necessary to protect the dialysator by decontamination of the fluid immediately before entering the dialysator. Using filters with a pore size of 0.2 micrometer or 0.45 micrometer sterile samples of dialysis fluid could be obtained, but flow rate and pressure of the fluid could not be kept constant, when the resistance of the filter increased during use. With UV-lamps no problems concerning flow rate or pressure were encountered, but really satisfying results emerged only in laboratory experiments. This was due to causes which can be influenced by technical improvements of the irradiation unit, while the use of filters implies additional measures at the monitor unit to control flow rate and pressure. The success of the applied antimicrobial techniques should be monitored for not inducing a false conviction of safety.
