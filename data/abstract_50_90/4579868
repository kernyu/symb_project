Introduction of the su58 missense suppressor into the chromosome of the uvr502 mutant, either by mutation or by transduction, results in a marked increase of ultraviolet resistance of the uvr502 mutant. In the uvr(+) genetic background, the su58 suppressor causes some decrease of ultraviolet resistance and marked increase in the spontaneous mutation frequency. The presence of the su58 suppressor did not decrease the high frequency of spontaneous mutants in the population of the uvr502 strain. However, the significant increase in spontaneous mutant frequency in the uvr(+)su58 strain makes the difference between the uvr502 su58 and the uvr(+)su58 strains 18 times lower than that between the uvr502 and the uvr(+) suppressor-free strains. Since the missense suppressors act at the level of translation, the results suggest that the product of the uvr(502) gene is a protein.
