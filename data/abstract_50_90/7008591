The development of antimicrobial resistance by bacteria has had profound effects of the clinical use of antibiotics, especially in hospital-acquired infections. In 1973, a large outbreak of nosocomial infections due to Serratia marcescens began at the Vanderbilt University medical complex, a major characteristic of which was high-level resistance to gentamicin and carbenicillin. Investigation of the outbreak and subsequent in vitro studies have shown that the evolution and epidemiology of this high-level resistance operated at three levels of organizations: (1) dissemination of individual strains, (2) dissemination of a plasmid among different strains and (3) movement of a discrete genetic element, or transposon, between plasmids. The investigations of this outbreak and other studies reviewed support the concept that resistant strains can evoke as a result of R-plasmid exchange within the hospital environment, providing an opportunity for control of this exchange can be interrupted.
