The OA-6129 group of carbapenem antibiotics were phosphorylated with ATP by Brevibacterium ammoniagenes at the primary hydroxyl group of the C-3 pantetheinyl side chain. The phosphorylation resulted in the reduced antimicrobial activity against some Gram-positive bacteria, and the improved activity against some Gram-negative microbes. The increased resistance of the OA-6129 carbapenems due to phosphorylation was significant to mouse renal dehydropeptidase and moderate to the human enzyme. OA-6129A and B2 phosphates were found to be unsusceptible to A933 acylase, while OA-6129A and B2 were depantothenylated.
