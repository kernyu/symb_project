Ethyl-O-[N-(p-carboxyphenyl) carbamoyl]-mycophenolate (CAM), a mycophenolic acid (MPA) derivative, has been evaluated in terms of influence of treatment schedule and route of administration on antitumor activity in mice bearing L 1210 leukemia and cross-resistance to 6-MP was studied. The results obtained were as follows; The effect of oral administration of CAM was identical to that of MPA or FT-207. Both CAM and MPA were most effective when given on day 1, 5 and 9 following tumor inoculation. Intraperitoneal administration with MPA was marginally effective, while the activity obtained with intraperitoneal administration of CAM was superior to that for oral administration. CAM did not show any cross-resistance to 6-MP.
