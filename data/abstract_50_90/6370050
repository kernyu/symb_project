Swine fecal Escherichia coli isolates were tested with the Microtiter broth dilution method for susceptibility to carbadox and 11 other antimicrobials. Of the 138 strains, 136 were resistant to sulfadiazine, 120 to tetracycline, 95 to streptomycin, and 63 to carbadox. Resistance to the remaining antimicrobials also was noted in various degrees, with the exception of amikacin, to which all strains were susceptible. Carbadox-resistant strains also were resistant to other antimicrobials. The multiple resistance pattern was most common to sulfadiazine and tetracycline or a combination of sulfadiazine, tetracycline, and streptomycin.
