Bacterial conjugation is a major mechanism for the spread of antibiotic-resistance genes in pathogenic organisms. In gram-negative bacteria, broad-host-range drug-resistance plasmids mediate genetic exchange between many unrelated species. The mechanism of conjugation encoded by the broad-host-range IncP plasmid RK2 has been studied in detail. The location and sequence of the transfer origin of RK2 has been determined. Several barriers limit plasmid transfer between unrelated bacteria: interactions at the cell surface may prevent effective mating contact, restriction systems may degrade foreign DNA, or the plasmid may not replicate in the new host. RK2 has evolved specific mechanisms by which it overcomes these barriers; this plasmid can mediate the transfer of resistance to most gram-negative bacteria.
