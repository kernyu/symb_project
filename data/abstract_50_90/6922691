Susceptibilities of 82 clinical isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae, including 25 from the middle-ear fluid, were evaluated against antibiotics commonly used in the treatment of acute otitis media. Potentially significant resistance occurred in 6% of the isolates to erythromycin and an erythromycin-sulfisoxazole combination. The combination of trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole was synergistic for 95% of the isolates. Only 2.5% of all of the isolates were resistant to both erythromycin-sulfisoxazole and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. The presently used drug regimens should be effective against the majority of S. pneumoniae isolates in otitis media.
