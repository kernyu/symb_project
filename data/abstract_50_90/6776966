86.4% of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 91% of the Serratia marcescens strains were sensitive to fosfomycin. In combination with mezlocillin, cefoxitin, gentamicin and nalidixic acid a synergistic action was detected against these bacterial strains. It was most marked in the combination fosfomycin/nalidixic acid against Serratia marcescens. An acceleration of the fosfomycin action on the bacterial cells and the speed of bacteriolysis was observed in weakly acid medium (pH 6.0), in the presence of 10% active human serum and with increasing glucose-6-phosphate concentrations in the test medium. There is no parallel resistance between gentamicin and fosfomycin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
