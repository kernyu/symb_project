Investigation of the properties of antibiotic-resistant variants obtained experimentally from various species of Brucella indicated that benzylpenicillin, ampicillin and ceporin induced significant changes in the main properties of Brucella, i.e. phagolysability, agglutinability, production of brucellacin and hydrogen sulfate, attitude to dyes. Only the nutrient requirements of Brucella did not change when it was grown on synthetic media which is of great importance for investigation of changed Brucella strains.
