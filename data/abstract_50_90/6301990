Factors which control the levels of catalase within yeast cells of Histoplasma capsulatum were studied. Only a small fraction of the total catalase activity could be detected in whole cells. The bulk of the activity was revealed in cell-free extracts or in cells permeabilized with acetone. The formation of the enzyme was regulated by glucose and by oxygen. There were large, consistent differences in the levels of catalase among strains of H. capsulatum. The sensitivity of the strains to H2O2 toxicity also varied remarkably. Peroxidase activity could not be detected in cell-free extracts of the strains. Resistance to H2O2 did not correspond to levels of catalase. There was no obvious correlation of H2O2 sensitivity and virulence among the strains.
