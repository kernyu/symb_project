In order to visualize low-pH compartments of Plasmodium berghei strains we have used a basic congener of dinitrophenol, 3-(2,4-dinitroanilino)-3'-amino-N-methyldipropylamine (DAMP) which concentrates in acidic compartments, and can be detected by immunocytochemistry with anti-dinitrophenol antibodies. We have demonstrated that in a P. berghei chloroquine-sensitive strain (N strain), DAMP accumulates in the endocytic vacuoles where haemoglobin degradation is occurring. These compartments which have recently been shown to concentrate 4-aminoquinoline drugs (Moreau, Prensier, Maalla & Fortier, 1986) have an acidic pH. Conversely DAMP was found scattered all over the cytoplasm in a P. berghei chloroquine-resistant strain; the same phenomenon was previously observed (Moreau et al. 1986) in the localization of a 4-aminoquinoline on this same strain. Monensin-induced swelling of acidic compartments (Boss & Morre, 1984) was used as a complementary method for the determination of low-pH compartments on P. berghei strains. All the data reported here suggest that chloroquine resistance in P. berghei RC may be related to an impairment in the acidification of endocytic vesicles.
