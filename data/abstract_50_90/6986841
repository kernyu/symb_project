The effect of detergents, i. e. cationic, anionic, nonionic and polyelectrolytes of the cationic type on the efficacy of chloramphenicol against resistant strains of E. coli and Staph. aureus was studied. It was found that the detergent effect on inactivation of chloramphenicol by the bacterial resistant strains was inconsistent. The cationic detergents and in particular chlorhexidine had the most pronounced inhibitory effect. In subbacteriostatic concentrations they significantly suppressed inactivation of chloramphenicol in the cells of E. coli and Staph. aureus. The anionic detergents and polyelectrolytes of the cationic type in the above concentrations were effective only with respect to Staph. aureus. It is noted that the detergents increased the activity of chloramphenicol against E. coli and Staph. aureus.
