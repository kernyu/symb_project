The uninduced culture supernatants and cell extracts from 58 strains of the 3 biovariants (biovar) of Mycobacterium fortuitum were all positive for beta-lactamase with the chromogenic cephalosporin substrate. By analytical isoelectric focusing (IEF), 29 of 30 strains of biovar fortuitum exhibited an identical beta-lactamase pattern with 1 major band. In contrast, the beta-lactamases of biovar peregrinum and the unnamed third biovar were heterogeneous, with multiple bands and a variety of patterns. The pH range of isoelectric points for the beta-lactamases was relatively narrow, however, with most bands appearing between pH 4.3 and 5.2. Although additional genetic studies are required, these enzymes appear to be chromosomal, as they are present in all strains including some without detectable plasmids. Repeat isolates from the same patient obtained up to six months apart always had the same beta-lactamase pattern by IEF. Of the third biovar complex, 30% are cefoxitin resistant with minimal inhibitory concentrations greater than 32 micrograms/ml. All 9 cefoxitin-resistant isolates tested had the same unique beta-lactamase pattern by IEF, although this enzyme failed to hydrolyze cefoxitin while hydrolyzing cephalothin and benzylpenicillin. Thus, despite the association of cefoxitin-resistance with a single enzyme pattern, the role of this beta-lactamase in resistance is not known.
