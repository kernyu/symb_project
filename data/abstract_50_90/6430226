A mutation (env-10) conferring increased susceptibility to drugs, dyes, and detergents was detected in a clinical isolate of Neisseria gonorrhoeae. In certain strains, env-10 also affected susceptibility to pyocins. This mutation was phenotypically similar to but genotypically distinct from previously described env mutations.
