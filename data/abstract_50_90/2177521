The MSS51 gene product has been previously shown to be involved in the splicing of the mitochondrial pre-mRNA of cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COX1). We show here that it is specifically required for the translation of the COX1 mRNA. Furthermore, the paromocyin-resistance mutation (P454R) which affects the 15S mitoribosomal RNA, interferes, directly or indirectly, with the action of the MSS51 gene product. Possible roles of the MSS51 protein on the excision of COX1 introns are discussed.
