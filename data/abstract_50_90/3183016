The addition of 2% NaCl to cation-supplemented Mueller-Hinton broth (CSMHB) was evaluated for microdilution testing of the susceptibility of staphylococci to five cephalosporins, imipenem, amoxicillin-clavulanate, and ticarcillin-clavulanate. With Staphylococcus aureus, NaCl improved the recognition of methicillin (oxacillin) resistance to cefamandole, imipenem, or ticarcillin-clavulanate. Resistance to amoxicillin-clavulanate was readily determined, irrespective of the presence of added salt. The addition of 2% NaCl to CSMHB did not significantly improve detection of resistance to any of the beta-lactams among coagulase-negative staphylococci. Since the addition of NaCl did not have significant adverse effects on tests with coagulase-negative staphylococci, the routine addition of 2% NaCl to oxacillin or methicillin tests with staphylococci may be justifiable on the basis of convenience or standardization. However, addition of NaCl to susceptibility tests of other beta-lactams does not consistently improve recognition of resistance among staphylococci and thus cannot be recommended for routine use.
