The in vitro antimicrobial activity of temocillin against 130 strains of Enterobacteriaceae and 27 strains of Pseudomonas and other related Gram-negative organisms was compared with carbenicillin, mezlocillin and piperacillin. Temocillin was compared with ampicillin against 76 strains of Haemophilus influenzae. More than 90% of Enterobacteriaceae including 65 carbenicillin-resistant strains were inhibited by 8 mg/L of temocillin. Pseudomonas spp. were less susceptible to temocillin than to the other 3 penicillins. 35 out of 38 strains of beta-lactamase-producing H. influenzae were inhibited by 2 mg/L of temocillin. But with 38 ampicillin-sensitive and non-beta-lactamase-producing ampicillin-resistant strains, temocillin was slightly less active than ampicillin. There was no significant enhancement of temocillin activity by clavulanic acid against 20 strains of Gram-negative rods producing characterised beta-lactamases. The resistance to plasmid-mediated and chromosomal beta-lactamase extracts was also studied by bioassay method. No enzyme extracts tested could hydrolyse temocillin except that from one Flavobacterium strain.
