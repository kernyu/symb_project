Staphylococcus aureus isolates were either sensitive, resistant or partially resistant (minimum inhibitory concentration 90 of 4 micrograms/ml) to methicillin. Low-level methicillin resistance was shown to be due to beta-lactamase production. The clinical significance of this beta-lactamase-mediated resistance is still unclear, so it is recommended that these strains should, at present, be regarded as methicillin-resistant.
