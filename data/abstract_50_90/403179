Nineteen Bacillus subtilis isolates obtained from type culture collections were examined for the presence of covalently closed circular duplex deoxyribonucleic acid molecules by the technique of cesium chloride-ethidium bromide density gradient centrifugation. Four of the 19 strains tested carried covalently closed circular molecules. Two of these strains (IFO3022, IFO3215) harbored a similar plasmid with a molecular weight of 5.4 X 10(6). The other two strains (IAM1232, IAM1261) carried 4.9 C 10(6)-and 5.3 X 10(6)-dalton plasmids, respectively. These plasmid-harboring strains did not show phenotypic traits such as antibiotic resistance orbacteriocin production. The plasmid deoxyribonucleic acids were digested by three restriction endonucleases, EcoRI, HindIII, and BamNI, and were classified into three different types from their electrophoretic patterns in agarose gels.
