The kinetics of colchicine uptake into Chinese hamster ovary cells have been investigated and found to be consistent with an unmediated diffusion mode. A variety of compounds such as local anesthetics and non-ionic detergents as well as drugs such as vinblastine, vincristine, daunomycin and actinomycin D potentiate the rate of colchicine uptake into these cells and into colchicine resistant mutants. In all cases, higher concentrations of these compounds were required to stimulate colchicine uptake in the colchicine resistant mutants than in the cells of the parental line. This stimulation was observed also in the uptake of puromycin, a structurally and functionally different drug. These stimulatory agents did not, however, cause the cells to become nonspecifically leaky since the uptake of 2-deoxy-D-glucose was unaffected. In addition, the activation energy of colchicine uptake was unaltered in the presence of stimulating agents, implying that they were not causing colchicine to enter the cells via a different mechanism. The results are compatible with the view that these compounds are membrane-active, and are able to stimulate an increased rate of unmediated diffusion of colchicine into the cells. It appears that a mechanism for the regulation of passive permeability is modified in the resistant mutants.
