Pefloxacin was used as monotherapy in 15 cases of peritonitis occurring in patients undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). Antibiotic administration was made intravenously on day 1 (800 mg) and from day 2 to day 4 (400 mg/day), then orally during 10 days (400 mg/day). The dosage of 400 mg gave a mean serum concentration peak (11.2 mg/l) and valley (5.4 mg/l) on the second day and a mean dialysate level of 5 mg/l. The last mean serum concentration (J14) were 5.5 mg/l (peak) and 2.5 mg/l (valley) and the mean dialysate level was 2.6 mg/l. Ten of these patients were cured. We explained pefloxacin therapy failure in two cases by resistant strains (S. sanguis and S. bovis), in one case by an acquired resistance during treatment (S. epidermidis), in an other case by catheter contamination; and in the last case, clinical failure occur despite good sensitivity with in vitro-test (Acinetobacter).
