Cinoxacin was almost completely absorbed when given orally and was found to be approximately 60 to 70% protein bound. Peak serum concentrations were reached within 2 h, and detectable serum concentrations persisted up to 12 h after administration of 0.25-, 0.5-, and 1-g multiple oral doses. Although food delayed the absorption and caused a 30% reduction in mean peak serum concentrations, the overall 24-h urinary recovery was not significantly altered. Approximately 50 to 55% of the drug was excreted in the urine as unchanged drug. At 12 h, urine concentrations were still above the minimal inhibitory concentration for most common gram-negative urinary pathogens. Cinoxacin was well tolerated when administered to 23 volunteers from 10 to 28 days. Resistance among fecal isolates initially susceptible to cinoxacin was not observed in nine volunteers who were administered 0.5 g every 12 h for 4 to 28 days.
