In vitro activity of pipecolic acid amide of clindamycin (U-57930E) against 265 isolates of anaerobic bacteria, including 66 strains of Bacteroides fragilis, was compared with those of clindamycin, chloramphenicol, and cefoxitin. At therapeutically achievable concentrations, the activities of all four antibiotics against anaerobic bacteria were similar.
