Pustules from 92 new cases of pustular acne and gram-negative folliculitis were cultured in aerobic medium for superimposed bacterial infection. During the treatment of 1,561 new patients with papular acne with tetracycline and topical clindamycin and antibacterial soaps, an additional 10 developed pustules. The majority showed in vitro resistance to ampicillin. The effective treatment was co-trimoxazole and topical gentamicin. A new classification of acne with practical therapeutic use is needed.
