Clinically isolated 741 strains of 10 bacterial genus (except for Pseudomonas aeruginosa) which are frequent causal pathogens of infection in the otorhinolaryngological field were examined for their sensitivity to second-generation cephem agents, CTM, CXM and CMZ using the first-generation agent, CEZ, as a control. 1) The antibacterial activity of CTM, CXM, and CMZ was expanded to H. influenzae and Proteus spp. (indole positive) as compared with the first-generation agent, CEZ. CTM and CXM and strong antibacterial activity against H. influenzae. CMZ was slightly inferior to them in this activity. In contrast, against Proteus spp. (indole positive) CMZ was most effective and CTM was more effective than CXM. 2) The proportion of strains of S. aureus resistant to CEPs was 6.5% in CEZ, 4.8% in CTM, 8.1% in CXM, and as low as 1.6% in CMZ.
