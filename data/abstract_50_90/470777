A survey is given about epidemiological data and the different forms of clinical course of Yersiniosis enterocolitica. As a rule the enteric Yersiniosis heals spontaneoulsy without antibiotic therapy. In our own cases 9 of 13 patients were children. In the majority of these 13 cases symptoms of appendicitis were found. A survey about the behaviour against antibiotics of our tested strains show that Yersinia enterocolitica is resistant to all beta-lactam-antibiotics. The detection of Yersinia enterocolitica in stool specimens is not difficult provided that the inquiry is directed specially on this agent.
