A soluble extract prepared from cells of an Escherichia coli strain carrying the antibiotic resistance plasmid R6K is capable of carrying out the complete process of R6K DNA replication. DNA synthesis in vitro is dependent on the four deoxyribo- and ribonucleotide triphosphates and is sensitive to rifampin and streptolydigin, inhibitors of DNA-dependent RNA polymerase. The incorporation of deoxyribonucleotides into R6K DNA also is sensitive to actinomycin D, novobiocin, arabinofuranosyl-CTP, and N-ethylmaleimide. Kinetics of synthesis are linear for 60 to 120 min. Replication proceeds semiconservatively and supercoiled closed-circular DNA molecules are synthesized. Analysis by alkaline sucrose gradient centrifugation indicated that the early R6K DNA products contain DNA fragments of approximately 18 S in size, corresponding to the length between the R6K alpha origin of replication and the terminus of replication observed in vivo. Addition of exogenous supercoiled R6K DNA is inhibitory to the in vitro system, whereas the addition of R6K DNA in the form of relaxation complex stimulates R6K DNA synthesis to a small extent.
