Sensitivity of the glanders causative agent to 20 antibiotics representing different groups is described. The results of the in vitro studies showed that most of the antibiotics were not active against the glanders causative agent, except for polymyxin M, levomycetin and their combination. Some relative activity was observed with neomycin. The "indicators" method used by the authors for determination of the M. mallei sensitivity to the antibiotics allowed the shortening of the time of the test by 8 to 10 hours.
