Clinical effects of cefpiramide (CPM) on 10 respiratory tract infections were excellent in 9 and poor in 1, and those on 3 urinary tract infections were excellent in 3. Although CPM is considered to be excreted mainly into bile, it was suggested that the excretion rate of CPM at doses of 10 approximately 20 mg/kg into urine is good enough. Antibacterial activity of CPM was considered to be almost the same as that of cefmetazole and cefoperazone. As to side effects, weak diarrhea was observed in 2 cases. This should be considered when CPM is given to children because of its main excretion route to bile duct.
