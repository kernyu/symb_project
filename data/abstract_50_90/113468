Isolates from the blood of 30 patients with endocarditis due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa were tested for synergy between carbenicillin and an aminoglycoside, either gentamicin or tobramycin, by in vitro checkerboard methods in modified (cation-supplemented) Mueller-Hinton broth. Twenty-five of the 30 isolates were affected synergistically. Whether given low (2.5--5 mg/kg) or high (8 mg/kg) doses of aminoglycoside along with 30 g of carbenicillin daily, all of the five patients infected with pseudomonads that were not synergistically affected were refractory to treatment with pseudomonads that were not synergistically affected were refractory to treatment with the carbenicillin-gentamicin combination, whereas the finding of synergy of carbenicillin with gentamicin (or tobramycin) did not assure a medical cure. Tests for synergy between carbenicillin and gentamicin yielded different results in Mueller-Hinton agar than in modified Mueller-Hinton broth. The majority (28) of 30 isolates of endocarditis-producing P. aeruginosa were resistant to the bactericidal effects of 50% pooled normal serum that had been freshly separated. One of the endocarditis-producing strains that was sensitive to 50% serum was resistant to 10% serum. However, sensitivity or resistance to freshly separated, pooled normal human serum did not predict the outcome of antibacterial therapy for pseudomonas endocarditis.
