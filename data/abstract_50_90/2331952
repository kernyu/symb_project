The effects of zinc L-carnosine on ethanol-induced damage and the correlation of these effects with endogenous prostaglandin E2 were evaluated in rat gastric mucosa in vivo and in vitro. When given either intragastrically or intraperitoneally, zinc L-carnosine (10 or 30 mg/kg) prevented gross visible damage to gastric mucosa caused by ethanol without affecting the mucosal prostaglandin E2 level. This protective effect of zinc L-carnosine was not inhibited by indomethacin. Histological assessment showed that zinc L-carnosine inhibited deep mucosal necrosis, as did 16,16-dimethyl prostaglandin E2. Zinc L-carnosine (10(-6) or 10(-5) M) inhibited the damage caused by ethanol to gastric cells isolated from rat gastric mucosa in vitro; this effect was not inhibited by indomethacin. The results suggested that zinc L-carnosine protects the gastric mucosa and enhances cellular resistance to ethanol without the mediation of endogenous prostaglandins.
