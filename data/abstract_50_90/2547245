Twenty-six elderly patients with chronic leg ulcers infected by Pseudomonas aeruginosa or other aerobic Gram-negative rods were randomised to two treatment groups. The control group (eight patients) received conventional local therapy and the other group (18 patients) was treated with oral ciprofloxacin for three months in addition to conventional local therapy. In the beginning of the study both groups were comparable with the age of the patients and the associated diseases including impairment of arterial and venous circulation in the lower legs. Also the size, duration and the severity of the inflammation reaction in the leg ulcers were comparable before the start of the therapy. Ciprofloxacin was clinically more effective than the standard therapy in reducing the size of the ulcer (p less than 0.05). Also the need of extra systemic antibiotics decreased significantly in the ciprofloxacin group compared with the controls. In three out of eighteen ciprofloxacin treated patients the leg ulcers disappeared completely during the three months' study period compared with none in the control group. However, ciprofloxacin resistant strains, mainly staphylococci, appeared in the leg ulcers in 67% of the ciprofloxacin treated patients compared with 0% in the control group (p less than 0.01). No significant side-effects due to ciprofloxacin except the resistant strains were noticed. We conclude that oral long-term ciprofloxacin therapy is effective in the treatment of chronic leg ulcer infections due to Gram-negative rods but selection of ciprofloxacin resistant strains is a problem in this patient group.
