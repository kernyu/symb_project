Antibiotic resistance patterns and the distribution of R-factors among Shigella, Salmonella and Escherichia coli isolated from diarrhoeic human beings were studied. Nine multiple antibiotic resistance patterns among which PNS TCK was the most common were observed. All the Shigella, Salmonella and eighteen Escherichia coli isolates transferred part of their r determinants respectively to E. coli K12. It is thought that enforcement of the law regulating the sales and judicious use of antibiotic in Human and Veterinary Medicines would reduce the incidence of multiple drug resistance in Nigeria.
