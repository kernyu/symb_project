We analysed the bacteriological urinary findings of all inpatients of the urological department on admission, during hospitalization and on discharge, over a period of one year. The percentage of urological patients with florid urinary tract infections was less than 10%. The most commonly found pathogen was E. coli, followed by Proteus, enterococci, Pseudomonas and Klebsiella. Any change in the bacterial spectrum was not associated with individual diseases or their treatment. Mixed infections were rarely seen. The nosocomial urinary tract infection rate was an overall 1.5%. Since the clinical findings on admission often require the immediate administration of antibiotics, the results of urine culture cannot always be awaited. Given the present situation with respect to resistance, the use of antibiotics with a sensitivity of only 50% does not appear to make good sense. Prior to receiving the bacteriological report, cephalosporins of the second and third generation are to be recommended to treat complicated urinary tract infections in hospitalized urological patients.
