Sulbactam/cefoperazone (SBT/CPZ) was administered intravenously to 9 patients with respiratory infections (H. influenzae 6 cases, pathogens unknown 3 cases), 2 patients with urinary tract infection (E. coli and C. freundii; both cases had VUR), and 1 patient with staphylococcal bacteremia. In these causative bacteria, 5 strains (H. influenzae 3, E. coli 1 and S. aureus 1) were beta-lactamase producers. Bacteriological efficacy (eradication rate) was complete (9/9, 100%) and clinical efficacy was also complete (12/12, 100%). In comparison with CPZ alone, MICs of SBT/CPZ against beta-lactamase producing bacteria were superior. Although mild side effect was observed in 1 case (eosinophilia), no other severe form of adverse reaction were encountered. It was concluded that SBT/CPZ was an useful antibiotic for the treatment of pediatric bacterial infections, especially caused by beta-lactamase (penicillinase) producing bacteria.
