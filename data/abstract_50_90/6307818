The structural gene for the glutamyl-tRNA synthetase of Escherichia coli has been cloned in E. coli strain JP1449, a thermosensitive mutant altered in this enzyme. Ampicillin-resistant and tetracycline-sensitive thermoresistant colonies were selected following the transformation of JP1449 by a bank of hybrid plasmids containing fragments from a partial Sau3A digest of chromosomal DNA inserted into the BamHI site of pBR322. One of the selected clones, HS7611, has a level of glutamyl-tRNA synthetase activity more than 20 times higher than that of a wild-type strain. The overproduced enzyme has the same molecular weight and is as thermostable as that of a wild-type strain, indicating that the complete structural gene is present in the insert. These characteristics were lost by curing this clone of its plasmid with acridine orange, and were transferred with high efficiency to the mutant strain JP1449 by transformation with the purified plasmid. A physical map of the plasmid, which contains an insert of about 2.7 kb in length, is presented.
