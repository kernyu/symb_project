In vitro antibacterial activity of cefamandole-fosfomycin (CFM-FOS) combination was studied on 50 methicillin-resistant staphylococci strains. Anti-bacterial effects were evaluated with a bactericidal microtiter checkerboard method. CFM-FOS was compared with other combinations known to be potent against staphylococci. Synergy was consistently recorded with CFM-FOS. Mean MBC of CFM combined with FOS was 1 microgram/ml. Vancomycin-fosfomycin combination was infrequently synergistic (20%). Rifampin-fosfomycin, cefamandole-fusidic acid, and cloxacillin-fusidic acid combinations were usually antagonistic at bactericidal levels. Rifampicin-fusidic acid combination usually yielded additive effects. CFM-FOS killed most methicillin-resistant staphylococci studied at therapeutic concentrations.
