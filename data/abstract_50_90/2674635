During a 12-month period, a systematic screening for thermophilic campylobacters was done on 5723 stool samples of hospitalized patients and out-patients who required stool culture tests for gastrointestinal disturbances. Campylobacter strains were isolated in 130 samples (2.27%) and Campylobacter jejuni (mainly biotype II) was the species most frequently isolated. No pronounced seasonal pattern was evident and the age at which infection was more often observed was that from 6 to 24 months. Erythromycin-resistance was found in only 8 strains and it was significantly more frequent among Campylobacter coli strains.
