Physically purified cell walls were prepared from selected pleiotropic novobiocin-resistant staphylococcal strains. The quantitative amino acid, amino sugar, and phosphorus contents of these walls are reported. This pleiotype was culturally diagnosed by its inability to support the growth of typing phages, inability to release latent bacteriophage, failure to elaborate coagulase, altered sugar catabolic pattern, and resistance to novobiocin. The strains were divided into two groups on the basis of wall composition. The walls of both groups of strains appeared to possess at least two phosphorus-containing polymers. On group of strains contained elevated levels of phosphorus in the cell walls. The second group contained the novel amino sugar galactosamine in the cell walls. This amino sugar is probably associated with one of the phosphorus-containing wall polymers of this group. On the basis of the data presented, it is suggested that the pleiotropy of these strains is the result of genetic change in the control of the biosynthesis of teichoic acids.
