The type and level of resistance of Bac. licheniformis 1001 to the antibiotic produced by it, i. e. bacitracin and the effect of bacitracin and some other drugs on the culture variation with respect to the feature of the antibiotic production were studied. It was found that strain 1001 possessed an inducible resistance to its own antibiotic. In addition, a cross inducible resistance to bacitracin and penicillin was observed. The mutations of the resistance to bacitracin, as well as streptomycin, rifampicin and sulfaethidole had no effect on bacitracin production by strain 1001.
