The susceptibility of 128 clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa against amikacin, kanamycin, gentamycin, minocycline, colistin, chloramphenicol, claforan , piperacillin and carbenicillin were tested. Piperacillin, carbenicillin, amikacin and claforan are effective against at least 54% of strains tested. The susceptibilities of microorganisms to antibiotics were evaluated in different points and discussed in details.
