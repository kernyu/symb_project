An ongoing survey of the susceptibility of the Bacteroides fragilis group of bacteria was continued at New England Medical Center in 1984 and 1985. A total of 1,229 strains were obtained from eight centers in the United States. These results were compared with those for 1,847 isolates tested in 1981 through 1983. The most active beta-lactam drugs were imipenem and ticarcillin-clavulanic acid (Timentin), which had a less than 1% resistance rate. No metronidazole- or chloramphenicol-resistant isolates were found during the 5 years of the study. Isolates obtained from blood, perinatal, and bone sites of infection were more resistant to a variety of antimicrobial agents. Susceptibility patterns of the members of the B. fragilis group varied at the eight hospitals and among species. These data indicate the need for determining the susceptibility patterns for the B. fragilis group of organisms at each hospital.
