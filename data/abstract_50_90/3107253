121 tissue specimens of the urogenital systems (66 from the kidney, 39 from the epididymis and testis, 8 from the prostate, 4 from the bladder and 4 from the female genital tract) were examined by microscopy, culture and animal experiment on the presence of mycobacteria. In 37 of these specimens (30.6%) mycobacteria were demonstrated, 10 of that only by microscopy and in 27 cases by culture and/or animal experiment. Up to 20 weeks after onset of treatment mycobacteria were demonstrated from the kidney tissue of treated patients by the diagnostic methods mentioned above. After this time mycobacteria never could be demonstrated. There was no correlation between the histological findings and the mycobacteriological investigations. The investigation of tissue specimens on the presence of mycobacteria also from other organs of the urogenital tract is suitable method of the bacteriological proof of tuberculosis, especially in the absence or positive bacteriological findings from the urine or accessory gland secretion for the estimation of species and resistance of these bacteria.
