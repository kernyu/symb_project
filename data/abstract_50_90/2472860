The IncHII plasmid pHH1508a (208 kilobases) encodes resistance to potassium tellurite, trimethoprim, and streptomycin. Conjugative pili encoded by pHH1508a were isolated, purified, and used for preparation of anti-H pilus antiserum. Immuno-gold labelling experiments using H pilus specific antiserum showed that antigenic determinants were located along the entire length of the H pilus. Immuno-gold labelling and lysis studies using pilH alpha, a bacteriophage specific for H pili, were used to investigate transfer-deficient mutants of pHH1508a obtained by Tn5 mutagenesis and an in vitro constructed derivative of 96 kilobases, pDT1178, which also conferred resistance to potassium tellurite, trimethoprim, and streptomycin. The transfer-deficient mutants did not specify H pili, whereas pDT1178, which transferred at low frequency (1 x 10(-4) transconjugants per recipient), specified a small number of H pili. A naturally occurring plasmid, pMG110, was found to encode the production of H pili, but was completely transfer deficient (less than 1 x 10(-7) transconjugants per recipient). This study suggests that genes required for H pilus production and assembly as well as low level transfer are located separately within the 96-kilobase fragment of pDT1178 and that other genes, located outside this region, are essential for the regulation and full expression of conjugative transfer.
