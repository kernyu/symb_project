The frequency of healthy carriers of meningococci in Greece in 1973 has been studied by examining 1105 nasopharyngeal swabs from 731 recruits, during the four recruitment periods of this year. The frequency of healthy carriers among inductees within 24 hours from the arrival in the Camp was 38.9%. After a stay of 35 to 40 days in the training Camp the frequency of healthy carriers rose to 66.4%. Among all the soldiers examined, 24.5% were carriers of meningococci of group B, 13.2% of non-typable strains, 8.1% of autoagglutinable strains, 4.1% of meningococci of group A, 3.7% of meningococci of group C and smaller percentages of strains of groups X, Y, Z and of cross-agglutinating strains. The prevalence of carriers of meningococci of groups A and C and of autoagglutinable strains was higher among recruits who have been in the Camp for 35 to 40 days. The prevalence of carriers of the other serogroups was about the same among the inductees and the other recruits. No significant differences were found in the frequency of carriers of each serogroup among soldiers on their arrival, who were permanent residents of urban or rural areas of various parts of the country. No significant seasonal variation was noted in the frequency of carriers of each serogroup. Frequent changes of the group of meningococci harboured were noted among 374 recruits examined upon their arrival, as well as after 35 to 40 days of residence in the training Camp. Among 534 strains of meningococci examined none was resistant to either minocycline or rifampicin. Among 226 strains isolated from inductees, 44.7% were resistant to 1 mug/ml of sulphadiazine, while among 235 strains isolated from recruits after they have been in the Camp for 35 to 40 days, 57.9% were resistant to that sulphonamide.
