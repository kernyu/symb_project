The cotransformation frequency of mecC5 with pur-102 using Staphylococcus aureus C5 deoxyribonucleic acid was found to be approximately 45%. However, in cotransduction studies, there was a 15% cotransduction of purine prototrophy and methicillin sensitivity but, in the reciprocal cross, no purine-prototrophic plus Mecr cotransductants were obtained (frequency less than 0.06%). The data support the hypothesis that the mec determinant resides on an inserted deoxyribonucleic acid sequence in S. aureus and that there is no allelic equivalent in sensitive cells.
