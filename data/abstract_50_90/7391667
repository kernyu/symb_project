We report a case of meningitis and perceptive deafness caused by Streptococcus suis type II (Group R beta-haemolytic streptococcus). The illness is known to be an occupational hazard of pigmeat handlers and our patient worked in a pet food factory processing pig meat. His hearing loss was very severe and showed no improvement despite adequate antibiotic treatment. The organism that was isolated is the first to show penicillin resistance. The implications of this for antibiotic treatment are discussed.
