Preparation STP, a new immunostimulating agent, is a substance produced by Streptococcus strain sp. Thom-1606 and capable of enhancing the nonspecific activity of the body as shown in animal experiments. The optimal dose-time parameters of the administration of the immunostimulator have been established by the method of the mathematical planning of experiments. As a result, the survival of all animals used in the experiment has been achieved. Mouse peritoneal macrophages have been found to form the population of target cells whose phagocytic activity is enhanced under the effect of the immunostimulating agent STP.
