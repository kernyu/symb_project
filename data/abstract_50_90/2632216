In vitro activity of four fluoroquinolones and four other antibacterial agents was tested against clinical isolates of Brucella melitensis. Initially all the 146 isolates studied were inhibited by 0.06-0.5 mg/l of ciprofloxacin and fleroxacin and 0.12-0.5 mg/l of pefloxacin or norfloxacin. One of these isolates developed resistance during therapy with ciprofloxacin, with a rise in MIC from 0.06 mg/l to more than 5.0 mg/l. This strain also showed cross-resistance to all other quinolones. All the isolates remained susceptible to tetracycline, gentamicin, rifampicin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. None of the quinolones showed in vitro synergy with other antibiotics.
