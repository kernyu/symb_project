The aminoglycosidic aminocyclitols have been utilized extensively for three decades. Nonetheless, the future use of this class of agents has been questioned of late. Recognized inadequacies of the aminoglycosides and the development of new antibiotics with significant activity against gram-negative bacilli are commonly cited reasons for the theorized decline of these compounds. However, resistance to newly developed antibiotics already has become evident. This insures a continuing role for the aminoglycosides in the treatment of nosocomial infections. Aminoglycosides will have continued use as empiric, potentially synergistic therapies for hospital-acquired infections in neutropenic patients with bacteremia, in enterococcal endovascular infections, and in patients with serious infections associated with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Those factors that will influence the future role of aminoglycosides in these settings will include economic, administrative, and space pressures to restrict the number of antibiotics available in hospitals, the discovery of novel antibiotics, the utility of combination therapies employing an aminoglycoside and newly available drugs, the comparative toxicities of new antimicrobial regimens, and considerations of cost containment.
