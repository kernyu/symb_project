During an outbreak of pseudobacteremia in a children's hospital, Ewingella americana was found in blood cultures from 20 patients. E. americana was inoculated into blood culture bottles at the time of specimen collection due to cross contamination from nonsterile, citrated blood collection tubes used for coagulation studies. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing and plasmid profiling were used to assess the association between patient isolates and isolates from unused blood collection tubes. All E. americana isolates had similar antibiograms (i.e., resistance only to cephalothin) when tested at 37 degrees C. However, when the same isolates were tested for antimicrobial susceptibility at 25 degrees C, a different antibiogram (i.e., resistance to chloramphenicol, ampicillin, and cephalothin) was found. The majority of these isolates also demonstrated a unique four-plasmid profile (130, 56, 4.6, and 3.1 megadaltons), and two of these plasmids (130 and 56 megadaltons) were characterized as temperature-sensitive plasmids. An epidemiologic link between outbreak-associated isolates obtained from different time periods in the outbreak was supported by evidence of a significant trend in the ability of the outbreak-associated isolates to reduce nitrate, together with the presence of the resistance antibiogram at 25 degrees C and the demonstration of the unique four-plasmid profile.
