Organisms are protected against infective agents by non-specific (innate) and specific (acquired) resistance. On body surfaces and the intestines as well as in tissues and in the circulation, non-specific mechanisms are the first line of defence. The most important exponents are a number of antimicrobial factors and phagocytes. Certain phagocytes are able to present 'processed' antigen to T and B lymphocytes, which are able to recognise fragments with antigen-specific receptors. T and B cells having the right specificity, acquired during their maturation, will become activated by recognition of antigen. Blast formation and proliferation will result in the appearance of T cells producing cytotoxins and other lymphokines, plasma cells producing antibodies and memory cells (T and B): the specific immune reaction. Subsequent activation of non-specific effector mechanisms and inflammatory reactions ultimately result in elimination of the initiating antigen. Vaccination is controlled administration of antigen in order to induce memory without the appearance of disease symptoms: an increased number of cells showing specificity for that antigen will respond more rapidly upon repeated contact. In case of subsequent natural contact with the infectious agent the organism will be protected, on one hand because of antibodies still present, on the other hand because the immune response develops faster and more efficient than on primary interaction.
