Haemophilus strains recovered from the upper respiratory tract in children were investigated by three one-month studies, in 1982, 1983 and 1984 respectively. Strains were recovered from nose and throat swabs in children hospitalized in a pediatric department during March/April. H. influenzae and H. parainfluenzae exhibited very different patterns of resistance to antibiotics. Little resistance was found among H. influenzae strains: percentage of ampicillin-resistant (beta-lactamase producing) and/or tetracycline-resistant strains did not exceed 4% and showed no change over the three study years. H. parainfluenzae was considerably more resistant, with percentages of strains resistant to one antibiotic or more reaching 25% in 1982 and 1983 and 36% in 1984. Resistance to ampicillin rose from 20-22% in 1982-1983 to 31% in 1984. Resistance to chloramphenicol emerged in 1984 and was found in 4.5% of strains; these strains were also resistant to ampicillin and tetracycline. Resistance to tetracycline was found in 18% of strains in 1983 and in 14% in 1982 and 1984. In 1983, three cases of meningitis due to an ampicillin-resistant strain (one of which was also resistant to chloramphenicol) were seen. Although one type b ampicillin-resistant strain was isolated in this study, such an occurrence seems difficult to predict and strains infecting the upper respiratory tract apparently do not become invasive under normal conditions. The possibility that H. parainfluenzae may be a reservoir of resistance genes for H. influenzae is considered.
