After taxonomic listing of group D streptococci, the authors discuss the methodology of the bacteriologic diagnosis of infections produced by these bacteria, showing the way in which the pathological products are collected, the strains isolated and seeded. The strains are identified in two stages: (1) group identification by group antigen identification, resistance to oxacillin, development at +45 degrees, development on bilaesculin media; (2) species and variety identification by biochemical, physiologic and metabolic tests, by lysotyping and enterocinotyping. A description is given of the testing of sensitivity of the strain to antibiotics by determination of the minimal inhibitory concentration. The formulas of the media used for culture and identification are given.
