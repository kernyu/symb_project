In a multi-center study 523 strains of H. influenzae and H. parainfluenzae isolated from patients in eight towns of the Federal Republic of Germany were tested for their sensitivity to 15 different chemotherapeutic agents. 1.7% of the strains were resistant to ampicillin, 1,5% to chloramphenicol and 2.5% to tetracycline. All ampicillin-resistant strains produced beta-lactamase. For the first time, multiple resistant strains were isolated: two against ampicillin, chloramphenicol and tetracycline; one in addition also against co-trimoxazole. It is likely that there will be a spread of such resistant strains.
