Monocyte chemotaxis and its response to levamisole were studied in patients with Hodgkin's disease. Levamisole caused a significant improvement of the deficient monocyte chemotaxis of the patients. By enhancing monocyte functions including chemotaxis, levamisole may contribute to the improvement of cellular immune reactivity, thus increasing the resistance to infections and prolonging the periods of remission.
