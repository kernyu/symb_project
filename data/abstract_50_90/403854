Sensitivity of the microflora of the oncological patients' wounds to the new antibiotics, such as gentamicin, kanamycin, oxacillin, ampicillin and lincomycin was studied with the help of the disc method. The discs with the above antibiotics were prepared under laboratory conditions in accordance with the respective instructions in the WHO. Sensitivity of 429 bacterial cultures, including 98 cultures of pathogenic staphylocci, 45 cultures of Enterococci, 43 hemolytic streptococci, 143 cultures of Escherichia, 50 cultures of Ps. aeruginosa and 50 cultures of Proteus was determined. The studies showed that gentamicin was the most active antibiotic aganist all the microbial species isolated from the surgical and other wounds of oncological patients. It may be used in treatment of the infections caused by association of the microbes belonging to different species, as well as in treatment of purulent processes before elucidating their etiology, 16.7 per cent of the Enterococcal isolates were resistant to gentamicin. Monomycin, kanamycin, oxacillin, lincomycin and macrolide antibiotics at present are sufficiently active against pathogenic staphylococci and hemolytic streptococci.
