We have examined posttranslational modifications which are responsible for converting an apparently single precursor (Hering, T. M., and Sandell, L. J. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 1030-1036) to the two major forms of link protein in bovine articular cartilage. Resistance to endoglycosidases H and F suggests that Asn-linked oligosaccharides of link protein secreted by bovine chondrocytes in culture are of the complex or hybrid type. There is no evidence for O-linked oligosaccharides. There is no apparent precursor-product relationship between link protein (LP)1 and LP2, since after a short pulse with [3H]leucine two forms are present, consistent with the existence of two glycosylation sites. An immunoprecipitate of LP1 from pulse-labeled chondrocytes was observed to show a decrease in electrophoretic mobility and increased microheterogeneity during transit through the Golgi, whereas LP2 did not change. During processing both LP1 and LP2 become endoglycosidase H resistant. LP1, but not LP2, can be biosynthetically labeled with [35S]sulfate. Incorporation of [35S]sulfate is inhibited by tunicamycin, indicating that the sulfate is associated with Asn-linked carbohydrate. Sulfation may be important for normal processing, secretion, or degradation of link protein and with sialylation may confer considerable charge heterogeneity upon LP1. We conclude that there are considerable biochemical differences between glycoproteins LP1 and LP2 which may provide a basis for functional differences.
