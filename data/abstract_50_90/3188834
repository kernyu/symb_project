A derivative of Rhizobium meliloti 41 was constructed (strain GY654) which was resistant to apramycin and kanamycin but remained sensitive to tobramycin. Strain GY654 selectively measures tobramycin and 6"-O-carbamoyltobramycin in the presence of apramycin, kanamycin and 6"-O-carbamoylkanamycin B, therefore it is suitable for the rapid quantitation of 6"-O-carbamoyltobramycin and tobramycin in fermentation broths of Streptomyces tenebrarius and solvents containing antibiotic mixtures.
