Mutants of Escherichia coli resistant to nitrofurantoin have been isolated. The mutations, designated nfnA and nfnB were introduced individually into a multiply auxotrophic E. coli F- strain and mapped by conjugation and transduction. nfnA is located at 79.8 min and nfnB at 13.0 min on the E. coli chromosome.
