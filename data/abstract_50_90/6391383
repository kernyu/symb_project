A study was made of resistance to heavy metals and antibiotics, biochemical characteristics, and colicinogeny in selected strains of Escherichia coli of O serogroups 8, 9, 20, 64, 101, and X46. Of 42 strains that were investigated, 26 were porcine enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC), 8 were porcine non-enterotoxigenic E. coli (NETEC), and 8 were bovine ETEC. Multiple resistance to antimicrobial agents was common among the strains, and resistance to chloramphenicol and kanamycin was less common than resistance to other drugs, possibly reflecting the lower frequency of use of these agents in pigs and calves. Colicin production was a more common property of porcine ETEC (80.8%) than of porcine NETEC (25%), and all porcine ETEC of O serogroups 101 and 64 were colicinogenic. Equal numbers of bovine ETEC strains were colicinogenic as were non-colicinogenic. Resistance of bovine and porcine strains to sodium arsenate, mercury, and tellerium was 90, 16, and 5%, respectively. There was a close relationship between serogroup and biochemical reactions among the E. coli strains tested.
