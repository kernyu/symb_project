Bacillus subtilis GSY908 DNA fragments (5.1 and 4.4 kilobase pairs (kb)) containing a tetracycline-resistance determinant were cloned in Escherichia coli using a shuttle plasmid vector pLS353. Restriction endonucelase analysis showed that the 4.4 kb fragment is a spontaneous deletion derivative of the 5.1 kb fragment. E. coli tetracycline-resistance transformants carrying pLS353 with the 5.1 kb fragment (named pTBS1) and that with 4.4 kb fragment (pTBS1.1) could grow at tetracycline concentrations up to 80 and 50 micrograms per ml, respectively. B. subtilis MI112 and RM125 were transformed by pTBS1, resulting in isolation of transformants of MI112 maintaining pTBS1 and RM125 maintaining either pTBS1 or pTBS1.1. Maximum tetracycline concentrations permitting growth of plasmidless MI112 and MI112 with pTBS1 were 4 and 10 micrograms per ml, respectively, while those of plasmidless RM125, RM125 with pTBS1 and RM125 with pTBS1.1 were 7, 50 and 80 micrograms per ml, respectively. It was interesting to note that the tetracycline-resistance level in E. coli conferred by the 5.1 kb fragment is higher than that conferred by the 4.4 kb fragment, but in B. subtilis the 4.4 kb fragment, in contrast, confers a higher level of tetracycline resistance. The level of tetracycline resistance in B. subtilis conferred by the cloned determinant clearly depends on the host strain. The tetracycline resistance conferred by the cloned determinant was associated with decreased accumulation of the drug into the cells. However, it was constitutive in E. coli, but inducible in B. subtilis. The cloned tetracycline-resistance determinant was detected specifically on the chromosome of B. subtilis Marburg 168 derivatives.
