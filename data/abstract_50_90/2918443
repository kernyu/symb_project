A Trypanosoma brucei brucei stock resistant to diminazene aceturate, isometamidium chloride, quinapyramine sulfate, and Mel B was grown in vitro and its response to these drugs compared to that of a drug-sensitive trypanosome stock. There was little if any change of drug sensitivity after in vitro propagation as bloodstream forms for 120, 177, and 275 days and after in vitro transformation of bloodstream forms into procyclic, epimastigote, and finally metacyclic forms. Drug resistance was stable during in vitro maintenance in the absence of drugs in both culture systems. The response of resistant and sensitive T. b. brucei to diminazene in vitro correlated with their sensitivity pattern in vivo. Thus, in vitro techniques can be used to study drug resistance in trypanosomes.
