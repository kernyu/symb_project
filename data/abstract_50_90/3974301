Erythromycin is a macrolide that acts by inhibiting the translocation reaction during protein synthesis. Erythromycin is inactive against the Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa except under alkaline conditions. Erythromycin is active against most gram-positive bacteria; some gram-negative bacteria, including Neisseria, Bordetella, Brucella, Campylobacter, and Legionella; and Treponema, Chlamydia, and Mycoplasma. The emergence of resistance to erythromycin is closely associated with its use and is often plasmid mediated. After its oral or parenteral administration, erythromycin diffuses readily into intracellular fluids and is actively concentrated intracellularly by polymorphonuclear leukocytes and alveolar macrophages.
