MIC determinations with the dilution method using DST-agar show that 7 beta-[2-amino-thiazol-4-yl)acet-amido-3-less than ([1-(2-dimethylaminoethyl)-1H-tetrazol-5-yl]thio)methyl greater than-ceph-3-em-4-carboxylic acid (cefotiam) is approximately ten times more active than cefoxitin or cefuroxime against non-selected bacterial isolates. Cefotiam is also significantly more active than cefoxitin or cefoperazone against mezlocillin- and piperacillin-resistant cultures. The determination of susceptibility to cefotiam gives reliable results with 30 microgram discs. Inhibition zones of up to 12 mm (corresponding to MIC superior or equal to 64 microgram/ml) should be considered as resistance and zones larger or equal to 18 mm (corresponding to MIC inferior or equal to 8 microgram/ml) as susceptibility.
