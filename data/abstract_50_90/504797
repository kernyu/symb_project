Field strains of Trichostrongylus colubriformis and Ostertagia circumcincta, designated PF4 and PF5 respectively, were recovered from a farm on which the sole use of levamisole over a preceding 12 year period led to the development of anthelmintic resistance. The results of field observations and preliminary critical trials in both Merino and crossbred sheep showed that both species have varying degrees of resistance to three major anthelmintics; levamisole, morantel tartrate and thiabendazole. Mean worm count reductions for adult T colubriformis (PF4) for therapeutic doses of morantel tartrate, thiabendazole and levamisole in crossbreds were 45.7 per cent, 97.3 per cent and zero respectively, and for Merinos 80.7 per cent, 88.3 per cent and 92.0 per cent respectively. Against O circumcincta the corresponding reductions for crossbreds were 51.4 percent, 95.4 per cent and 20.3 per cent and for Merinos, 52.5 per cent, 73.1 per cent and 29.8 per cent. There was no statistically significant difference in the responses of both parasite species to either levamisole or morantel. This result suggests that resistance to the two chemically unrelated drugs may be co-inherited.
