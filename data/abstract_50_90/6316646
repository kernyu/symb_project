Coinfection with vaccinia virus rescues vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) from the inhibitory effects of interferon (IFN) in mouse L cells. While vaccinia infection does not significantly affect VSV RNA synthesis, coinfection with vaccinia dramatically increases VSV protein synthesis in IFN-treated cells. Evidence is provided that vaccinia inhibits the activity of the IFN-induced dsRNA-dependent protein kinase.
