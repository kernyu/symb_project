Interactions between gastrointestinal worms (Ostertagia ostertagi, Cooperia oncophora) and lungworms (Dictyocaulus viviparus) in calves were studied by assessing the effect of primary infections with either group of worms on the development of homologous or heterologous challenge infections. Primary infections with lungworms resulted in some degree of resistance to challenge with gastrointestinal worms, but this resistance was lower than that found after homologous infection. Primary infections with gastrointestinal worms did not confer any resistance to challenge with lungworms. On the contrary, an indication was found of some enhancing effect of previous gastrointestinal worm infection on the establishment of lungworms. The highest degree of resistance against lungworm challenge was found where calves have been primarily infected with lungworms. Lungworm infections produced some elevation of serum pepsinogen levels. Gastrointestinal worms evoked a rise in circulating eosinophils, although this rise was smaller and occurred later than in lungworm-infected calves. Under the conditions of the experiment, the effect of 6000 infective lungworm larvae on weight gain was larger than the effect of 100,000 L3 of Ostertagia ostertagi and 100,000 L3 of Cooperia oncophora.
