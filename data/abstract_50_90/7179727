Studies were carried out on the uterus of a total of 454 cows (slaughterhouse material) for the presence of Campylobacteria. In 23 of the cases (5 per cent) such bacteria were found in different parts of the sexual apparatus: 9--in the cervix, 7--in the uterine horn, 5--in the ovary, and 2--in the oviduct. By their biochemical behaviour 14 strains were typed and affiliated to Campylobacter foetus veneralis (type I), and 2--to Campylobacter intestinalis (type II). In order to reduce the admixing side microflora the purification of the strains was carried out with chloralhydrate, brilliant green, and sodium azide (of which brilliant green only gave a positive effect). Besides, glutathione was used to stimulate the growth of Campylobacteria. Tested was also the sensitivity to 15 antibiotics and chemotherapeutics. Most active with regard to the strains proved kanamycin. The necessity is stated of working out an antibiogram for each single newly isolated and typed Campylobacterium strain.
