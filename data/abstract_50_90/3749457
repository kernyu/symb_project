The interactions of sequential X irradiation and actinomycin D (AMD) treatments for mutagenesis to 6-thioguanine resistance were investigated in CHO cells. Cells were exposed to single doses of X rays followed immediately by 1-h treatments with 0.1 or 1 microgram/ml AMD. X Rays alone induced mutagenesis which increased monotonically with dose to at least 8 Gy. AMD-treated control cultures showed slight to moderate cytotoxicity and little induced mutation. X Rays followed by AMD treatment produced bell-shaped mutagenesis dose-response curves with maximal mutation at approximately 5 or 4 Gy for 0.1 or 1.0 microgram/ml AMD, respectively. Induced mutation frequencies then fell to a negligible level at fractional survival levels below 0.10 for either combination treatment. Application of a stochastic Poisson distribution model to these data led to the prediction that two possible components govern induced mutation frequencies. First, X ray +AMD induced mutations may be depleted progressively with dose from the surviving populations by selective lethality, which we term mutational extinction. Second, X ray +AMD treatments were calculated to induce potentially much greater than additive mutagenesis. However, due to the overriding mutational extinction effect, most of these mutations are not recovered as viable colonies. These studies suggest that AMD binding to DNA immediately following irradiation may cause considerably enhanced mutagenic and often lethal DNA damage, and that mutational extinction may occur because these types of damage are statistically correlated in a sensitive subpopulation of exponentially growing CHO cells.
