We report a case of gonorrhea due to a penicillinase-producing strain of Neisseria gonorrhoeae resistant to spectinomycin in a 26-year-old man who had not been out of the United States for a year-and-a-half. His sexual contact also had no recent travel out of the United States. The genital and oropharyngeal infections were successfully treated with cefoxitin (1 g im) plus probenecid (1 g orally) and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (80 mg of trimethoprim and 400 mg of sulfamethoxazole). The patient took nine of the latter tablets daily for five days. The organism was a serovar IB-3, proline-requiring auxotype. The patient's isolate contained both 2.6-megadalton and 4.4-megadalton plasmids. Measurement of minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of antibiotics for the isolate confirmed the penicillin resistance and showed an MIC of spectinomycin of greater than 256 micrograms/ml. The epidemiologic investigation suggested that the source of the infection was a male contact with unusual clinical features, including bloody urethral discharge and a possible incubation period of 28 days.
