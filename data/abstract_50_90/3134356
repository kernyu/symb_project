The regulation of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) activity by the polyamine derivatives N1,N8-bis(ethyl)-spermidine and N1,N12-bis(ethyl)spermine was studied using a line of L1210 cells resistant to alpha-difluoromethylornithine (D-R cells), which contain very high levels of ODC, and a synthetic mRNA prepared from a plasmid containing an insert corresponding to ODC mRNA adjacent to an SP6 RNA polymerase promoter. Studies in which ODC protein was labeled in the D-R cells by exposure to [35S]methionine indicated that the polyamine derivatives and their physiological counterparts led to an increased rate of degradation of ODC and to a rapid reduction in ODC synthesis without affecting the content of ODC mRNA. Direct evidence that the polyamine derivatives act by inhibiting the translation of the ODC mRNA was obtained by studying their effects on the translation of ODC mRNA in reticulocyte lysates. This translation was strongly inhibited by the addition of N1,N8-bis(ethyl)spermidine, spermidine, N1,N12-bis(ethyl)spermine, or spermine but was not affected much by putrescine. The inhibition of the translation of ODC mRNA by either of the bis(ethyl) polyamine derivatives occurred at concentrations which stimulated total protein synthesis showing the selectivity of the reduction in ODC. The effects of polyamine derivatives and polyamines on translation of the plasmid-derived ODC mRNA were identical with those found with the D-R L1210 cell mRNA. This synthetic ODC mRNA lacks 261 bases of the 5'-leader sequences and 200 bases plus the poly(A) section from the 3'-nontranslated sequence. Therefore, these regions appear not to influence sensitivity of the ODC mRNA to inhibition of translation by polyamine derivatives.
