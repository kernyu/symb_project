Findings of original research on the factors of nonspecific resistance (interferon formation, antibacterial activity of peritoneal exudate cells, and natural cytotoxicity of splenocytes) and immunity (changes in sub-populational composition of spleen lymphocytes) in different types of influenza in mice are analysed. There was no infection-mediated suppression of the studied reactions, that could have been considered as a cause of death or a basis for immunodeficiency status. The correlation of the level of cerebral lipid peroxidation in mice with severe infection formed the basis for testing the synthetic antioxidant ionol as an anti-influenza agent. A prophylactic effect of ionol toward the development of influenza infection has been obtained. Its possible actions and the feasibility of search for prophylactic and therapeutic preparations among the agents with pathogenetic action is discussed.
