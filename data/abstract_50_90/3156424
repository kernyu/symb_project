Mitochondria from two different cytoplasmically inherited oligomycin-resistant Chinese hamster ovary cell lines synthesize an altered polypeptide compared to mitochondria from wild-type cells. For example, mitochondria from both oligomycin-resistant cell lines synthesize a polypeptide with a molecular weight of approximately 20,500, which is present in very low amounts in wild-type cells. In contrast, mitochondria from wild-type cells synthesize a polypeptide with a molecular weight of approximately 19,500, which is present in very low amounts in one of the oligomycin-resistant mutants and in reduced amounts in the other mutant. The gene which encodes this altered polypeptide is cytoplasmically transferred together with the oligomycin-resistant phenotype. This is the first example in mammalian cells where an altered mitochondrial gene product is shown to be associated with the cytoplasmic transfer of oligomycin resistance.
