The newly developed ceftizoxime rectal suppository (CZX-S) contains 125 mg or 250 mg ceftizoxime (CZX) in potency. From the laboratory and clinical studies on CZX-S, the following results were obtained. Concentration of CZX in serum and palatine tonsil when 250 mg of CZX-S was rectally administered reached the peak level rapidly. The serum levels were 9.39 micrograms/ml in 30 minutes, 6.00 micrograms/ml in 45 minutes, 4.55 micrograms/ml in 60 minutes, 3.87 micrograms/ml in 90 minutes and 2.65 micrograms/ml in 120 minutes. The palatine tonsil levels were 2.73 micrograms/g in 30 minutes, 1.83 micrograms/g in 45 minutes, 1.54 micrograms/g in 60 minutes, 0.99 micrograms/g in 90 minutes and 0.74 micrograms/g in 120 minutes. About 30% of serum concentrations were distributed into palatine tonsil. CZX-S was administered at a daily dose of 375 mg or 750 mg divided 3 times for 4 approximately 9 days in 19 cases of acute suppurative otitis media of children. The overall clinical effect was excellent in 7 cases, good in 7 cases, fair in 2 cases and poor in 3 cases. The effectiveness rate was 73.7%. No side effects were observed in any cases.
