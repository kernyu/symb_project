Cefamandole, a new cephalosporin derivative, was found to have a broad spectrum of activity against a cross-section of both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria isolated from clinical material. Gram-positive cocci, except for Streptococcus faecalis, were very susceptible. Penicillin G-resistant Staphylococcus aureus also was susceptible to cefamandole. Minimal bactericidal concentrations for gram-positive cocci approximated the minimal inhibitory concentrations. Strains of Haemophilus influenzae were very susceptible to the drug. Most strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella sp., and Proteus sp. were inhibited by low concentrations. Increasing resistance occurred with larger inocula. Strains of Pseudomonas sp. were resistant to cefamandole.
