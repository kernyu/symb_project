Apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) is the major protein constituent of plasma high density lipoproteins (HDL). To examine apoA-I processing and secretion, the human apoA-I gene (2.2-kilobase PstI-PstI fragment) linked to the mouse metallothionein promoter was transfected by electroporation into NIH 3T3 fibroblasts along with the plasmid pSV2 neo, which confers neomycin resistance. Transfected cells were selected for neomycin resistance and screened for the ability to produce apoA-I by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. In the absence of lipids in the medium, selected 3T3 cells secreted apoA-I, mainly in the proprotein form, at density greater than 1.25 g/ml. Following incubation of cells with lipids, and subsequent washing with lipid-free medium, apoA-I was recovered in the HDL region (1.063-1.21 g/ml) as well as in the 1.21 g/ml infranatant. Examination of the HDL fraction by electron microscopy revealed round particles, 10-21 nm in diameter. These data indicate that human apoA-I secreted by transfected 3T3 fibroblasts can assemble into lipoprotein particles under the appropriate conditions.
