In experiments with Wistar female rats it was shown that after administration in the form of inhalations (10.87 mg/m3) sisomicin was present in the animal feces in a concentration of 26.6 micrograms/g. Prolonged exposure to the antibiotic during the pregnancy term led to changes in microbiocenosis of the animal large intestine which was observed even a month after the delivery. The progeny of the animals was characterized by the presence of significant numbers of aerobic bacteria resistant to sisomicin and potentially pathogenic gram-negative bacteria including various species of Proteus in the intestine, as well as by higher periods of persistence of Klebsiella indicator strains administered orally.
