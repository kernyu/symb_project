Five patients on chronic hemodialysis regimens were hospitalized with six episodes of Staphylococcus aureus septicemia. Three of the patents acquired the infection during home dialysis, and it was related to the hemodialysis circulatory-access site in four. Initial therapy was methicillin sodium. Vanomycin hydrochloride was given in a 1-gm, single, weekly dose as the sole antibiotic after a short interval (mean, three days). Five of the six episodes were treated successfully. Staphylococcus epidermidis grew in blood cultures obtained during one of the treatments. The advantages of this regimen included a more prompt ambulation and the discontuation of constant infusions in patients with no peripheral veins available.
