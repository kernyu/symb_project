The story is told of how streptomycin, PAS and isoniazid came to be known as the first-line drugs. Although the present first line is generally accepted as rifampicin, ethambutol and isoniazid, the way in which these drugs should be used in different types of tuberculosis and in different parts of the world is discussed in relation to efficacy, toxicity and cost. Passing reference is also made to second-line drugs used in the retreatment of cases with bacterial resistance.
