In an effort to provide information concerning the bacterial sensitivities in the Dordrecht area, continuing surveys are performed on the laboratory results. In 1974 information was presented on the bacterial sensitivities and resistance patterns during the period between 1968 and 1970. It has now been possible to study data from 1971 to 1974. Approximately 4000 sensitivity reports were surveyed--1000 from each year. A transfer sheet which could be entered into a computer was filled in for each patient who had a bacterial isolate and an antibiotic sensitivity test. This report gives the results of the survey. It is concluded that specific antibiotic testing must be performed. As an example more strains are sensitive to doxycycline than to tetracycline.
