During a six-month period in 1980, tuberculosis was detected in 70 patients at our municipal hospital. Clinical and epidemiologic features of the disease continue to reflect those noted decades ago. Management of these patients was complicated by difficulty in confirming the diagnosis and relapse in patients resisting chemotherapy, although organisms resistant to antituberculosis drugs were infrequent. The hospital cost of caring for tuberculous patients was high (mean: $1941.36). As tuberculosis today remains a disease of the poor, costs for its care still are borne by the public. At a time when reduction in Federal support for tuberculosis control is being considered, it is important to realize that the disease remains a serious medical problem and financial burden in the United States.
