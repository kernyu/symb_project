Of 30 patients with predominantly anaerobic localized infections superimposed on chronic tissue damage related to trauma, ischemia, or tumor, 22 (73%) responded satisfactorily to moxalactam therapy. Moxalactam-resistant anaerobic pathogens emerged in two patients and were responsible for treatment failure. In six patients, two of whom also acquired resistant anaerobic pathogens, isolation of moxalactam-resistant aerobic pathogens increased during therapy.
