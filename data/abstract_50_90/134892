Four cytoplasmic mutants of Saccharomyces cerevisiae showing loss of mitochondrial rutamycin-sensitive ATPase activity but having significant cytochrome oxidase and NADH-cytochrome c reductase have been isolated. Genetic studies indicate the mutations to be closely linked to each other and have been assigned to a new locus, PHO1. The mutations show a low frequency of recombination with the OL12 locus, suggesting a linkage to this marker. They are not, however, linked to the OLI1 locus. Linkage of the ATPase mutations to the OLI2 locus is also indicated by restoration of wild-type diploids by sigma- clones that retain the segment of mitochondrial DNA carrying OLI2. Based on the recombinants issued from crosses of the mutants with a triple drug-resistant strain and an analysis of the resistance markers present in sigma- clones that are effective in restoring a wild-type phenotype, the PHO1 locus has been placed in the segment of DNA located between PAR1 and OLI2.
