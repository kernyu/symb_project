The peptidoglycan from two types of filamentous cell division mutants of Agmenellum quadruplicatum strain BG1 has been compared to that of the parent organism. Small variations in the total peptidoglycan composition on a dry-weight basis were found in the mutants. The reduced level of peptidoglycan in the serpentine mutant is consistent with a general decrease in the ratio of surface area to volume as compared to the parent organism. The increased peptidoglycan content in the septate mutant confirms previous ultrastructural observations of the greatly enlarged peptidoglycan septum between adjacent cells. A comparison of peptidoglycan composition and cross-linking in the two types of filamentous mutants of A. quadruplicatum and in drug-induced phenocopies suggests that structural alterations of the peptidoglycan are not involved in the apparent impairments of cellular division. Furthermore, data concerning the relative susceptibilities of the parent and mutants to antibiotics indicate that neither mutant exhibits a gross alteration of permeability.
