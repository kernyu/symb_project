Murine peritoneal thioglycollate-elicited macrophages were cultured for 3 days in the presence or absence of highly purified human macrophage colony stimulating factor (CSF-1). The cells were then challenged with vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) for 24 hr. Ability to resist viral infection was measured in two ways. First, macrophage viability after infection with VSV was measured by washing to remove dead cells, staining the remaining cells with crystal violet, and reading absorbance. Second, a yield reduction assay was used to measure viral replication in the macrophage cultures. Cells treated with CSF-1 (500 to 2000 U/ml) and infected with VSV looked similar microscopically to uninfected cells and had absorbance values twofold to threefold higher than those of infected cultures not treated with CSF-1. The CSF-1-treated cultures also had a virus titer one log lower than that of the untreated cultures. Treatment with partially purified murine CSF-1 induced a similar reduction in virus titer, whereas other murine CSF tested (purified murine GM-CSF, lung-conditioned medium that contains GM-CSF and G-CSF, and WEHI-3B-conditioned medium as a source of IL 3) had little to no effect on virus titer. Antibody to murine IFN-alpha/beta added to the macrophage cultures inhibited the protective effect of CSF-1, indicating that the CSF-1 effect was due to induction of endogenous IFN. Treatment with lipopolysaccharide (1 ng/ml) had some protective effect, which was blocked with polymyxin B. Polymyxin B did not inhibit the effect of CSF-1.
