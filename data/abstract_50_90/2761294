Treatment of Friend erythroleukaemia cells with cytochalasin B (CB) resulted in multinucleation and loss of viability characteristic of a virus-transformed cell line. In an attempt to isolate pseudonormal revertants of this cell line mutagenized cultures were exposed to CB and surviving clones isolated. Many of these were found to be mutants resistant to the growth inhibitory effects of CB. The proportion of such mutants was reduced by simultaneous selection in CB and cytosine arabinoside. Of 699 clones examined none consistently exhibited reduced levels of multinucleation in the presence of CB. The inability of CB to select for revertants displaying a phenotype closer to normal cells is discussed.
