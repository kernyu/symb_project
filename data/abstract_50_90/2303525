Hydrogen-peroxide-resistant Chinese hamster fibroblasts, derived from the HA-1 cell line, were isolated following continuous culturing in the presence of progressively increasing concentrations of hydrogen peroxide. The hydrogen-peroxide-resistant phenotype has been stable for over 360 days following removal from H2O2 stress. These H2O2-resistant cell lines demonstrate increased resistance to hyperthermic cell killing mediated by continuous heating at 43 degrees C but not 45 degrees C. The relationship between mammalian cellular adaptation to oxidative stress mediated by H2O2 and resistance to 43 degrees C hyperthermia is discussed.
