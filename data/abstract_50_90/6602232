The long-acting amoxicillin granules (L-AMPC) was administered to 12 patients with respiratory tract infections and the following results were obtained. 1. L-AMPC was administered to 6 cases of acute upper respiratory tract infection, 2 of lower respiratory infection with lung cancer, 2 of bronchiectasis, 1 of lower respiratory infection with diffuse interstitial fibrous pneumonia and 1 of chronic bronchitis, and the overall efficacy rate was 83.3% (10/12), excellent in 2, good in 8, fair in 1 and poor in 1. 2. Bacteriologically, H. influenzae (5 strains), S. aureus (3 strains), S. pneumoniae (1 strain) and S. faecalis (1 strain) were eradicated and each 2 strains of K. pneumoniae and C. diversus appeared after treatment. 3. No side effect was observed and a slightly transient elevation of GPT was observed in only 1 case. From the above, L-AMPC seems to be a useful and safety drug in respiratory tract infections.
