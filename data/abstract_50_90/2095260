The results of therapy of febrile episodes during the pregraft phase in bone marrow transplant was retrospectively evaluated in 84 granulocytopenic patients. Most patients received co-trimoxazole and i.v. ticarcillin as antibacterial prophylaxis. 47 episodes were treated with a third generation cephalosporin plus an aminoglycoside, with a 55% favorable response rate. 37 episodes were treated with a wide spectrum penicillin plus an aminoglycoside, with a 41% response rate (p greater than 0.05). Among the 23 infections caused by gram-negative bacilli the response rate was 89% (8 of 9) with the first regimen, and 21% (3 of 14) with the second one (p = 0.003). The investigation of in vitro sensitivity suggested that prophylactic ticarcillin favors the infections due to bacilli with cross-resistance to wide spectrum penicillins. The antibiotic regimen did not influence the final resolution or the mortality rate of the febrile episode.
