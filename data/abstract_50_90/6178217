The authors investigated the intensity of interferon production and the degree of the associated antiviral resistance induced by double-stranded synthetic polyribonucleotide interferon inducers poly(G) . poly(C), poly(G, I) . poly(C) and poly(G, A) . poly(C) in chick embryo cell cultures, continuous diploid human fibroblasts and in mice in the presence of amphotericin B, a macrolide polyene antibiotic enhancing the permeability of plasma membranes for macromolecules. Amphotericin B was found to increase considerably the interferon-inducing and antiviral activity of the above polyribonucleotide complexes in those cell systems where they induced interferon production and antiviral resistance alone, without the antibiotic, but to a lower degree. Amphotericin B did not contribute to the activity of the complexes in those cell systems where they were inert alone. The importance of permeability of the plasma membrane for interferon induction is discussed, and a conclusion is reached that the inertness of the complexes under study in one cell system and their activity in the others are not associated with differences in the permeability of the plasma membranes of different cells for polyribonucleotide interferon inducers.
