Methotrexate with citrovorum rescue (MTX-CF) was administered as primary treatment in 106 patients with gestational trophoblastic disease (GTD). Ninety-six patients (90.6%) achieved complete remission with MTX-CF and 77 of these patients (80.2%) required only one course of MTX-CF to attain remission. MTX-CF induced sustained remission in 89 (94.7%) of 94 patients with nonmetastatic GTD and in seven (59.3%) of 12 patients with low-risk metastatic GTD. Resistance to MTX-CF was more common in patients with disseminated disease and with pretreatment hCG titers greater than or equal to 50,000 milliIU/ml. Following MTX-CF, granulocytopenia, thrombocytopenia and hepatotoxicity was observed in only seven (6.6%), three (2.8%), and ten (9.4%) patients, respectively. MTX-CF should be the preferred primary treatment in nonmetastatic and low-risk metastatic GTD.
