Fundamental and clinical studies on S 6472 were carried out and following results were obtained. Serum concentrations after single oral administration showed 2 peaks at 1 or 2 hours and 5 or 6 hours in the cases with normal meal. Namely this drug has much more maintenance of serum concentration than normal cefaclor. In maintenance of serum concentrations after the administration, there were no obviously difference between normal and heavy meal. S 6472 was administered twice a day to 7 patients with various infections (bronchopneumonia 2 cases, acute bronchitis 1 case, purulent tonsillitis 4 cases) and clinical responses were all effective results. Pathogenic bacteria of S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes and H. influenzae were completely eliminated in all cases. No significant side effects were observed. On the above results, this administration method of S 6472 twice a day was considered to be good response against mild or moderate bacterial infections in children.
