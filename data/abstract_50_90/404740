Of 921 women examined, 112, or 12.1%, were identified as having gonorrhoea by positive culture; 25.6% of 78 strains isolated from the women were resistant to penicillin at 0.10 mug/ml level and 14.1% resistant at the 0.50 mug/ml level as determined by an agar dilution MIC test. Our results were compatible with a similar but larger study reported in the USA by Jaffe et al. 1976.
