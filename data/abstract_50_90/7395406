The study of the distribution of lactobacilli in the lumen and on the mucosa of the intestine of CBA mice, as well as the interaction of lactobacilli with the mucosa under normal conditions and in experimental postradiation dysbacteriosis, showed that under normal conditions lactobacilli could be found practically in all portions of the intestine of the mice both in the lumen and on the mucosa. Lactobacilli were closely associated with the mucosa, and this association was not affected by the treatment of the mucosa with trypsin and detergents. In postradiation dysbacteriosis the association of lactobacilli with the mucosa became weaker; as a result, the number of bacteria associated with the mucosa decreased 10 times. Exogenic streptomycin-resistant lactic acid bacteria, subjected to multiple passages through the organism of the animals, could take on the intestinal mucosa.
