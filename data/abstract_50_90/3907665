A number of assays have been described for aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes; the aim of our investigation was to check the validity of polarized immunofluorescence assay for aminoglycoside enzymes. We have studied three enzymes encoded by R-factors from clinical isolates of Enterobacteriaceae conferring various patterns of aminoglycoside-resistance. The assay resulted valid: this is a simple, rapid and sensitive method.
