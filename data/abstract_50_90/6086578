A nonconjugative kanamycin-resistant (Kmr) recombinant plasmid, pNR5311, transferred at a low frequency from an Hfr or F' lac Escherichia coli donor to an F- lac- recipient. Among the transconjugants, two types of Kmr plasmids were found: one was indistinguishable from pNR5311 (type A), and the other was a recombinant between pNR5311 and the gamma delta sequence (type B). When the F' lac strain was used as a donor, 5% of lactose-fermenting (Lac+) and 75% of lactose-nonfermenting (Lac-) transconjugants had type A plasmids. A kinetic study revealed that type A plasmids were transferred more readily in short mating periods than were type B plasmids. Involvement of Tn903, which is present in pNR5311, in transfer of type A plasmids was unlikely since there was no discernible change in the F' lac molecule coexisting with the type A plasmid in the transconjugant cells. The non-gamma delta-associated conduction of pNR5311 by F' lac did not require the recA+ function of the donor. Conduction of pBR322 by F' lac was also carried out, and two types of plasmids with and without gamma delta were found, as with pNR5311. These findings suggest that the transfer of nonconjugative plasmids is conducted by a novel pathway which is not associated with translocation of transposable elements into either plasmid.
