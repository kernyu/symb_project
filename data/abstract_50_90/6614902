Total and monensin-resistant anaerobic bacterial populations and volatile fatty acid concentrations were examined in the rumens of steers fed monensin-containing (33 mg/kg) and unmedicated diets. Total anaerobic counts on a habitat-simulating medium ranged from 7.1 X 10(8) to 7.1 X 10(9) CFU/g of rumen ingesta and were not significantly different in animals fed the two diets. The mean percentage of the anaerobic population resistant to monensin (10 micrograms/ml) was significantly greater in animals receiving the monensin-supplemented diet for 33 days than in those receiving the unmedicated diet (63.6 and 32.8%, respectively). Treatment group differences in monensin resistance tended to develop later than characteristic differences in acetate/propionate ratios. Relative proportions of resistant organisms in monensin-fed animals remained significantly greater for at least 18 days after monensin was deleted from the ration, whereas acetate/propionate ratios increased to values comparable to those in the control within 10 days. These data suggest that monensin-resistant bacteria may be present in greater numbers in the rumens of animals fed monensin-supplemented diets. However, greater proportions of monensin-resistant organisms were not necessarily associated with altered fermentation patterns.
