The sensitivity of 67 strains of Neisseria gonorrhoeae isolated from 1977 to 1978 were tested against the new cephalosporin derivative (6R,7R)-7-(2-[3,5-dichloro-4-oxo-1(4H)-pyridyl]-acetamido)-3-([(5-methyl-1,3,4-th iadiazol-2-yl)-thio]methyl)-8-oxo-5-thia-1-azabicyclo[4,2,0]oct-2-ene-2-carboxyli c acid (cefazedone, Refosporen). All strains including three penicillin-resistant beta-lactamase producing Neisseria were sensitive at a range of 0.0078 to 2.0 micrograms/ml cefazedone.
