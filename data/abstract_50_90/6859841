The in vitro susceptibilities of 181 isolates of precisely identified Proteeae species to five semisynthetic penicillins were determined with low and high inocula. Significant differences in susceptibility patterns among various Proteeae species to the penicillins examined were demonstrated. Providencia stuartii was clearly distinguished from Providencia alcalifaciens by its greater resistance to the antibiotics tested.
