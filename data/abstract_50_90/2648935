The new penicillins developed over the last few years have helped improve our therapeutic armamentarium against enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas, beta-lactamase-producing Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria, Acinetobacter and anaerobes. However, they are of no benefit in the treatment of infections caused by staphylococci, streptococci and Listeria. These new molecules have little toxicity and represent a breakthrough in the development of drugs with improved pharmacokinetic properties and resistance to bacterial beta-lactamases. However, none has escaped the development of resistant bacteria that may cause clinical failures; this event is to be expected as resistant strains have been recovered from stools.
