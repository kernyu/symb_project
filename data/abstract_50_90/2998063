In HSV-1 infected cell the antiherpes drug (E)-5-(2-bromovinyl)-2'-deoxyuridine (BVdU) exerted at least three different effects on glycosylation of glycoprotein gC. First, an overall decrease of protein glycosylation occurred due to inhibition of synthesis of the lipid-linked oligosaccharides, precursors of N-linked oligosaccharides of gC. Second, an inhibition of processing of N-linked oligosaccharides occurred after the acquisition of endo H-resistance, and possibly due to inhibition of galactose incorporation. Third, a small inhibition of incorporation of glucosamine into O-linked oligosaccharides, and, may be associated with this, a change in the proportion of two different classes of O-linked oligosaccharides of gC, namely those with terminal N-acetylgalactosamine and those with terminal sialic acid.
