Successive reculturing of Torulopsis glabrata on media containing increasing concentration of the polyene macrolide antibiotics nystalin or lucensomycin resulted in the segregation of cultures resistant to these antibiotics. Isolates resistant to lucensomycin showed good resistance to nystatin, and vice versa. Analysis of the sterols and fatty acids of sensitive and polyene resistant T. glabrata revealed that compositional changes occurred in both classes of lipids upon acquistion of resistance. The sterol composition of nystatin and lucensomycin resistant cultures possessed reduced amounts of, or no ergosterol (the major sterol of the sensitive parent culture), and increased amounts of sterols which were biogenetically more primitive than ergosterol. Resistant cultures in which ergosterol was absent possessed a fatty acid composition that did not differ significantly from the parent sensitive culture grown under identical conditions. Resistant cultures containing significantly reduced amounts of ergosterol were found to possess altered fatty acid compositions. Generally it was observed that these latter cultures possessed fatty acids containing shorter and more saturated chains. These results are considered to indicate that alteration in both lipid and sterol composition is involved in determination of culture resistance to polyene macrolides.
