Two classes of polyene-resistant mutants were isolated from survivors of N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine treatment of a wild-type Candida albicans. An analysis of the major sterols of one class revealed an accumulation of lichesterol and fecosterol while the other class accumulated eburicol, obtusifoliol, and lanosterol with minor quantities of C28 sterols.
