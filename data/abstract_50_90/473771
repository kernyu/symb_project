The results of combination therapy of Isoprodian with ethambul in patients with severe pulmonary tuberculosis were found to be comparable with the results previously obtained by us with other first-choice therapeutic regimens. 61% of the 140 cavities found before treatment disappeared within 5 months and 74% within 8 months of therapy. Disappearance of bacilli from the sputum was demonstrated in 89% of the patients by 12 weeks and in all patients by 20 weeks of treatment. The satisfactory therapeutic results, the low toxicity, the convenience of administration and, moreover, the economic aspect of the relatively lower cost of Isoprodian therapy justify the further use of Isoprodian supplemented with a first-choice tuberculostatic drug in the initial phase of treatment followed by long-term therapy with Isoprodian on its own in the stabilizing phase of even severe cases of tuberculosis.
