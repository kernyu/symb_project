API ATB 24H is an automated system designed to test the sensitivity of bacteria to antibiotics. Using this system we found that it was not fully able to detect acquired resistance to oxy-iminocephalosporins in enterobacteriaceae producing extended broad spectrum betalactamase (CTX-1, SHV-3, SHV-4). However, the frequency of detection varied with the type of API SYSTEM (ATB G-, ATB PSE), the nature of beta lactam antibiotic (cefotaxime, ceftazidime) and the type of beta lactamase produced. Considering the fact that this new mechanism of resistance must be taken into account, we suggest that the most simple method for the detection of oxy-imini beta lactamases is a double disk test of synergy between Augmentin (acid clavulanic + amoxycillin) and 1 disk of oxy-iminocephalosporin.
