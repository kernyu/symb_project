All the rapidly growing mycobacteria tested, Mycobacterium fortuitum complex, M. smegmatis, M. phlei, and M. vaccae, contained one of two characteristics, but were different from previously recognized aminoglycoside-acetyltransferases. The acetylation reaction of both the enzymes from M. fortuitum and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (3-N-acetyltransferase-III) with radiolabeled acetyl coenzyme A was inhibited severely by oxalacetate. It was suggested that the inhibitory effect of oxalacetate is due to the condensation reaction between oxalacetate and acetyl coenzyme A resulting in the generation of citrate.
