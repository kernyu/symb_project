Ofloxacin belongs to a new generation of fluorinated quinolones which are structurally related to nalidixic acid. It is an orally or parenterally administered antibacterial drug active against most Gram-negative aerobic bacteria, many Gram-positive bacteria and some anaerobes. The pharmacokinetic profile or ofloxacin shows a rapid gastrointestinal absorption and high concentrations are achieved in most tissues and body fluids. Clinical efficacy of ofloxacin has been demonstrated in a variety of systemic infections as well as in acute and chronic urinary tract infections and ofloxacin has generally appeared to be at least as effective as comparative orally administered antibiotics. Ofloxacin is well tolerated and bacterial resistance does not appear to develop readily, however, noncritical use of quinolones in simple infections where standard drugs may be equally effective and safe should be discouraged. In conclusion, ofloxacin is an orally active drug which offers a valuable alternative to other broad spectrum antibacterial drugs.
