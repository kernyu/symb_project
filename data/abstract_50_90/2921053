The safety and efficacy of intralesionally administered interferon alfa-2b were assessed in 11 patients suffering from condylomata acuminata for four to 10 months for whom application of podophyllum resin had proved unsuccessful. Three warts from each patient were injected with 10(6) IU interferon alfa-2b three times a week for three weeks. Treatment was followed by a 13 week observation period. Interferon alfa-2b treatment resulted in a highly significant (p less than 0.0001) reduction in the mean size of the treated warts, which decreased from an initial size of 29 mm2 to 2-3 mm2 by week 16. In six out of the 10 patients completing the trial, both the test condylomata and adjacent control warts cleared completely; a recurrence was observed in one of these six patients. Influenza like symptoms (headache and myalgia) were the most common side effects reported, though they were mild in nature and not disabling. These results corroborate those of previous trials with interferon preparations and indicate that its antiviral activity makes it a possible treatment for this sexually transmitted disorder.
