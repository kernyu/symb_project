Bacteriophage Mu DNA integration in Escherichia coli strains infected after alignment of chromosomal replication was analyzed by a sandwich hybridization assay. The results indicated that Mu integrated into chromosomal segments at various distances from oriC with similar kinetics. In an extension of these studies, various Hfr strains were infected after alignment of chromosomal replication, and Mu transposition was shut down early after infection. The positions of integrated Mu copies were inferred from the transfer kinetics of Mu to an F- strain. Our analysis indicated that the location of Mu DNA in the host chromosome was not dependent on the positions of host replication forks at the time of infection. However, the procedure for aligning chromosomal replication affected DNA transfer by various Hfr strains differently, and this effect could account for prior results suggesting preferential integration of Mu at host replication forks.
