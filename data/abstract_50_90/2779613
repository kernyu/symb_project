The antifungal activity of a new semi-synthetic lipopeptide named cilofungin (LY-121019) was studied in vitro on 102 strains of Candida and Torulopsis glabrata. A standardized protocol for susceptibility testing by means of a microtiter Sabouraud broth dilution was used. The minimal inhibitory concentrations of cilofungin for C. albicans (N = 50) ranged from 0.039 to 5.0 micrograms/ml with a geometric mean of 0.47 micrograms/ml. The same results were obtained with C. tropicalis but one strain showed higher resistance (40 micrograms/ml) suggesting an Eagle effect. The MIC for T. glabrata ranged from 5.0-40.0 micrograms/ml. C. parapsilosis and C. krusei were less susceptible (5.0-40.0 micrograms/ml). These results indicate that cilofungin exhibits a potent inhibitory action on C. albicans and C. tropicalis. This effect was lower against the other species of Candida and T. glabrata studied.
