Representative plasmids from incompability groups B, C, H, J, K, M, V, and X were transferred to "bald" strains of Escherichia coli or Salmonella typhimurium. By using a new technique, pili were detected by electron microscopy for each incompatibility group. Morphology varied but was similar for plasmids within a group. These findings suggest that all conjugative plasmids in the Enterobacteriaceae may determine pili.
