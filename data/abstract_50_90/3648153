The in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of a new aminoglycoside antibiotic, arbekacin (HBK), against methicillin-cephem-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) were compared with those of gentamicin (GM), netilmicin (NTL) and amikacin (AMK). The results obtained were summarized as follows: Compared to other aminoglycoside antibiotics, HBK had the highest antibacterial activities against clinically isolated MRSA (46 strains). Therapeutic effects of HBK against experimental systemic infections with MRSA in mice, were superior to those of GM, NTL and AMK. The ED50's of GM, NTL and AMK were more than 2 mg/mouse. Therapeutic effects of HBK against experimental subcutaneous infections with MRSA in mice were also superior to those of GM, NTL and AMK.
