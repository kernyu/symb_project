Haemophilus test medium (HTM) was developed recently for dilution and disk diffusion antimicrobial agent susceptibility testing of Haemophilus influenzae. The application of HTM to the testing of other, less frequently encountered Haemophilus species recovered from humans was evaluated in this study by using commercially prepared HTM (BBL Microbiology Systems, Cockeysville, Md.) in broth microdilution and agar disk diffusion susceptibility tests with 18 antimicrobial agents. A total of 93.3% of 90 isolates belonging to six Haemophilus species provided acceptable growth in HTM agar disk diffusion tests, while only 63.3% (57 of 90) provided acceptable growth in the broth microdilution tests. However, HTM agar dilution testing provided an alternative method for those strains (primarily H. haemolyticus) which failed to grow adequately in broth. Based on the latest National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards guidelines (standard M2-T4) for interpretation of HTM disk tests of H. influenzae, the overall very major, major, and minor errors for all 18 drugs and six species tested were 0.2, 0.7, and 3.4%, respectively. Thus, the use of HTM in agar or broth susceptibility tests can be recommended for testing the less commonly encountered Haemophilus species by using the same test conditions and interpretive guidelines developed for H. influenzae.
