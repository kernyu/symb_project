The sensitivity of 44 coagulase positive Staphylococcus aureus strains to antibiotics has been determined. They have been isolated from in-patients and staff in a piedmontese hospital. It has been possible to obtain the phage typing of 26 of these strains: 4 have been attributed to group I, 3 to group II, 13 to group III and 6 to the "miscellanea". Some correlations have been established considering the data obtained by the laboratory and through epidemiologic research.
