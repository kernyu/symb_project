Two cases of nocardial mycetoma were successfully treated with a mixture of trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole (Bacterim). The patient in case 1 showed resistance to treatment with antibiotics and sulfamethoxypyridazine, and the causal agent of the disease could not be isolated. In case 2, bone involvement was seen; the causal agent was N asteroides. No adverse effects of the drug occurred in a period of treatment ranging from three to nine months.
