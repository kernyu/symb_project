The construction of new cloning vectors for Bacillus subtilis is described. They are derived from the in vitro joining of parts of pE194 and pUB110 DNAs. Their common feature is to present a cloning site immediately after the promoter and ribosome binding site of the erythromycin resistance gene, allowing the insertion and expression of either sticky or blunt ended DNA fragments coding for any heterologous gene. The cloning and expression of Escherichia coli beta-lactamase and EcoRI methylase are given as examples. The enzymes are efficiently synthesized by B. subtilis cells.
