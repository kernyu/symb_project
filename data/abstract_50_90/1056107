A brief description of nomenclature differences and classification principles is followed by a report of the results from an analysis of cases of osteomyelitis of the jaw which have been treatedduring the years 1967-1972. During this period, altogether 745 patients with soft-tissue infection and 72 patients with osteomyelitis have been treated at the clinic. The chronic form of osteomyelitis is considerably more frequent than the acute one. The odontogenic mode of infection prevails by far. The flora of causativeorganisms and the resistance conditions are dealt with separately. The mixed flora dominates; monoinfections are rare. Antibiotherapy occupies the first place in the treatment of the acute forms whereas surgical intervention is the method of choice in the treatment of the chronic forms of osteomyelitis.
