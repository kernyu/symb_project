A mouse L-cell line, designated 111-OB3, is described which is resistant to two drugs, chloramphenicol and oligomycin. The cells contain two types of mitochondrial DNA molecules, in roughly equal proportions, which differ in that one is cleaved by endonuclease EcoRI at a novel site within the coding sequence for subunit 6 of the mitochondrial ATPase (ATPase-6). Sequence analysis reveals that the cleavage site was created by a single transversion which predicts a replacement of valine in the wild-type ATPase-6 by glutamic acid. The replacement occurs in a hydrophobic amino acid sequence which is highly conserved in mouse, human, and bovine proteins. The position of the replacement is similar to a substitution observed in one class of yeast mutants resistant to oligomycin. Both of the mitochondrial DNA molecules in 111-OB3 also have a single nucleotide change in the gene encoding the large (16S) rRNA. These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that oligomycin resistance in mammalian cells can be cytoplasmically determined and can result from alterations in ATPase-6. The appearance of the mutation before selection in oligomycin suggests a model for the origin of mitochondrial mutations in mammalian cells.
