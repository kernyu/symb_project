Mutants of Bacillus subtilis capable of secreting high amounts of protease were highly tolerant to the lethal and lytic effects of nafcillin. Protease-deficient mutants were more susceptible. However, when subtilisin was added to exogenously to a protease-deficient strain, the organism assumed the characteristics of nafcillin tolerance. Similarly, when phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, a serine protease inhibitor, was added to the tolerant strains, they became susceptible to nafcillin-induced lysis. The effects of nafcillin on B. subtilis were studied with both viability determinations and assay of cellular lysis. The minimum inhibitory concentrations of nafcillin tended to be higher for the protease hyperproducing strains, but these values could be reduced by the protease inhibitor. No loss of antibiotic activity was observed when nafcillin was incubated with either subtilisin or trypsin. Furthermore, protease and autolysin from B. subtilis were not modified by nafcillin. The results showed that extracellular proteases could render B. subtilis relatively tolerant to the killing and lytic effects of a cell wall antibiotic. The proteases were probably acting on the autolysins of the organism, thereby increasing tolerance to nafcillin.
