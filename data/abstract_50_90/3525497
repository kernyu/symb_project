BO-1165 has excellent antibacterial activity against Gram-negative bacteria but it is almost inactive against Gram-positive and anaerobic bacteria. BO-1165 was more active than the four reference drugs against Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, indole-positive and indole-negative Proteus. Also, BO-1165 exhibited high antibacterial activity against strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC50, 3.12 mg/l) and P. cepacia (MIC50, 1.56 mg/l), but did not against Ps. maltophilia strains. BO-1165 had good stability to plasmid-mediated and chromosome-mediated beta-lactamases. However, the compound was slightly hydrolyzed by the beta-lactamases isolated from Proteus vulgaris, Ps. cepacia, Klebsiella oxytoca and Ps. maltophilia, which were capable of hydrolyzing aztreonam.
