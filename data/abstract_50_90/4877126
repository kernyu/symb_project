Two essentially isogenic strains of Escherichia coli K-12 were compared: D31 had chromosomally and D1-R1 episomally mediated resistance to ampicillin. The two strains had the same ability to form colonies on ampicillin plates, but in other tests they were quite different. In serial dilution tests as well as in exponentially growing cultures, D1-R1 was far more resistant to ampicillin than was D31. The inoculum effect with D1-R1 was large and with D31 was rather small. On plates, D31 was more resistant to penicillin G than was D1-R1. The penicillinase activity of buffer suspended cells against dl-ampicillin was 15 times higher for D1-R1 than for D31, but the two strains showed about the same rate of hydrolysis of penicillin G. With dl-ampicillin as substrate, for D1-R1 the apparent K(m) was 1.7 x 10(-4)m, whereas D31 gave a slightly sigmoid curve with a half-saturation concentration of about 5 x 10(-3)m. No induction of penicillinase activity was found. When the growth rate was varied by a factor of four, the amount of penicillinase per cell mass was constant in both D1-R1 and D31, whereas in two wild-type strains the amounts of penicillinase increased with increasing growth rates. With exponentially growing D1-R1, ampicillin disappearance started within 3 min, but at low ampicillin concentrations the rate was less than 10% of the rate of hydrolysis by buffer-suspended cells. Before D31 started hydrolysis, there was a lag period that lasted at least one generation and depended on the concentration of ampicillin. After this lag period, the rate of hydrolysis was 10 times higher than that observed with buffer-suspended cells. These differences between growing and nongrowing cells indicate that both the chromosomally and the episomally mediated penicillinases are controlled by some products present in growing cells.
