More than 200 strains of Campylobacter (C.) jejuni/coli isolated in 1985 and 1987/88 from human fecal specimens were tested for their susceptibility to erythromycin and ciprofloxacin. Their MIC90 as assessed by agar dilution tests was 2.0 and 0.5 mg/l, respectively. Thus, all strains were regarded as susceptible to ciprofloxacin. With 2 out of 55 strains of C. coli the MIC of erythromycin was 8.0 mg/l. Therefore, only 3.6% of the C. coli strains were resistant to erythromycin. All 209 strains of C. jejuni proved to be susceptible to erythromycin.
