Subunits A and B of DNA gyrase were purified from Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 and its mutant, which was resistant to nalidixic acid. Inhibition tests of DNA gyrases reconstituted with a combination of subunits from the two strains showed that an alteration of subunit A but not subunit B caused bacteria to resist fluoroquinolones.
