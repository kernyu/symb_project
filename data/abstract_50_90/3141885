The in vitro antibacterial activities of three fluoroquinolones (pefloxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin) against 90 clinical isolates of Branhamella catarrhalis were assessed by determination of minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs). 73.5% of the strains were producing penicillinase. The MICS90 were as follow: ciprofloxacin = 0.2 mg/l. The MIC50 and the MIC90 were similar. There was no correlation of MICs with beta-lactam resistance. Lung parenchyma and bronchial mucus diffusion of these three fluoroquinolones allowed their utilisation in Branhamella catarrhalis bronchopulmonary infections.
