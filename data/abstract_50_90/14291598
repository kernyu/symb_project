Bacteriol. 89:1581-1585. 1965.-L forms were obtained from group A streptococci by exposure to bacitracin on gradient plates, although novobiocin was ineffective in this respect. Subcultures of these L forms had morphological and bacteriological properties similar to those obtained with penicillin. M protein was detected in L-form colony smears by immunofluorescent staining with type-specific conjugate. The L forms were not stained with group-specific conjugate. Parallel precipitin tests performed with extracts from a heavy growth of L forms on agar confirmed these findings. Thus, the L forms obtained with bacitracin continue to produce M protein but are devoid of the group-specific carbohydrate which is a major component of cell-wall structure.
