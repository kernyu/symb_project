The paper reports on the biochemical characteristics and the antibiotic resistant phenotypes in 18 strains of H. influenza (17 b serotype and a strain of c serotype) isolated from the CSF of the patients with purulent meningitis. The following were found: --all the 16 viable strains have homogeneous biochemical characteristics, typical for H. influenza; --the viable strains were: 7 biotype, 4 biotype II, 1 biotype III, 3 biotype IV and 1 biotype VII; --68.8% of the strains had the following antibiotic resistant phenotypes: Ap, Km, Rf, ApKm, ApRf, ApKmTc, ApKmRfT and ApCmFrKmRfTc; --the strains of the biotypes II and IV have the highest resistance to antibiotics, as concerns frequency and phenotype; --the frequency of the resistant strains is of 56.2% for ampicilline, 18.7% for tetracycline, 31.2% for rifampicine and 6.2% for cholarmphenicol.
