Plasmodium falciparum's response to quinine (7.5 g of base in 5 days) was studied in vivo in 58 adult patients hospitalized in 1985--47% presented a pernicious malaria fever three deaths were registered during treatment, two of them attributed to late hospitalization, and the third patient was struck down by a sudden acute hepatitis. Three days after treatment started 89 of the patients did not present any asexual forms. At day 7, all patients responded favourably to the treatment. Parasitemia lowered very quickly whatever the route of administration had been. Quinine had no effect on production of gametocytes during the first four days. Clinical improvement is rapidly observed and the side effects of quinine disappeared when stopping the treatment. Despite the presence in the region of an important resistance of Plasmodium falciparum to chloroquine (80% specimens), one can conclude to a satisfying susceptibility of this parasite to quinine, provided posology and divided doses are respected.
