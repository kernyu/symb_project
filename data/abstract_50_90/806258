R factors determining multiple resistance including both gentamicin and carbenicillin have been identified in high incidence among hospital isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The factors are readily transmitted to other P. aeruginosa but not to Escherichia coli strains K-12 or C, or to Proteus mirabilis. R factor-containing isolates are predominantly immunotype 7 isolated from urinary sources.
