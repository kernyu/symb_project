Previous studies have indicated that combining cerium nitrate with silver sulfadiazine (Silvadene, Marion Labs) yields a superior topical agent for the treatment of burns. Cerium nitrate in silver sulfadiazine was tested in a controlled study with silver sulfadiazine alone. The study population consisted of two groups of children suffering burns greater than 30% of the body surface. The patients ranged in size from 1 to 21 years. The study period was for the first 10 weeks of hospitalization. Quantitative surface cultures were used to monitor burn wound flora. No superiority for the silver sulfadiazine-cerium nitrate combination was demonstrated. In fact, cultures indicate a significantly greater percentage of Gram-negative pathogens in patients treated with the cerium mixture. Cerium nitrate could possibly prove of greatest benefit if used as a reserve therapy for colonizing organisms which do not routinely respond to silver sulfadiazine.
