Serratia marcescens strains from three hospitals in the city of New York were tested for antibiotic susceptibility patterns and the presence of transmissible antibiotic resistance factors. There appears to be a pattern characteristic for each hospital with regard to the sensitivity to nalidixic acid, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, and sulfonamides, whereas the resistance to ampicillin, cephalothin, and streptomycin is similar in the strains isolated from all three hospitals. In one hospital, a single type of R factor was found which transfers resistance to streptomycin, kanamycin, ampicillin, and sulfonamides, whereas strains isolated from a second hospital transfer only ampicillin resistance. No R factors could be detected in multiply resistant Serratia strains isolated in a third hospital. The presence of a single type of R factor probably reflects the relative ecological isolation of S. marcescens and could be useful for epidemiological studies of hospital infections with Serratia.
