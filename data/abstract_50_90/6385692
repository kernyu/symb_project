From November 1982 to September 1983, three cases of invasive infection due to Fusarium species were documented in bone marrow transplant recipients. Fusarium was cultured from discrete skin nodules (one patient), maxillary sinus (one patient), or from the blood and surgically excised nasal septum (one patient). All three isolates were resistant to 5-fluorocytosine, whereas only one isolate was resistant to amphotericin B. Although all three patients died, two of the patients had clearing of their Fusarium infection. From this experience and from a review of the literature, it is concluded that despite the dismal prognosis for immunocompromised patients with Fusarium, beneficial therapies would include systemic amphotericin B, local surgical resection, and possibly leukocyte transfusions.
