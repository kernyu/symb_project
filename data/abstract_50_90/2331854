A new difluorinated quinolone, lomefloxacin, was shown to have potent in vitro activity against a broad spectrum of bacteria, including multiresistant strains isolated from patients with severe infections in three hospitals in Mexico City. Whereas its activity was comparable to that of another fluoroquinolone (enoxacin), the pharmacokinetic advantages offered by lomefloxacin may be a significant benefit in clinical use.
