Tobramycin is a new antibiotic resembling gentamicin. We measured the minimal inhibitory concentrations of these two antibiotics against five bacterial species that cause hospital-acquired infections and are resistant to many presently available antibiotics. The organisms tested were 500 strains of Pseudomones aeruginosa, 100 strains of each of Proteus rettgeri and Pr. morganii, 50 strains of Pr. vulgaris and 250 strains of Providencia stuartii. Tobramycin was 2 to 4 times more active than gentamicin against Ps. aeruginosa; all except 6 of 70 strains resistant to 4 mug/ml of gentamicin were sensitive to 4 mug/ml of tobramycin. The two antibiotics showed a similar degree of activity against the other four species. Tobramycin promises to be of particular value in the treatment of Pseudomonas infections.
