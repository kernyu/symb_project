Purified vaccinia virus rapidly inhibited HeLa cell protein synthesis in the presence of actinomycin D. Under these conditions host polyribosomes were extensively degraded but the mRNA was stable as indicated by a greater than 90% recovery of prelabeled polyadenylylated RNA. Although actinomycin D prevented the synthesis of host mRNA and poly(A) in uninfected cells, incorporation of adenosine into poly(A) was inhibited by less than 50% in infected cells. Further analysis indicated that there was little or no normal size viral mRNA but that a unique class of small poly(A)-rich RNA was made in the presence of actinomycin D. From measurements of the RNase resistance and base composition of the RNA, approximately 40% of the nucleotide sequence was estimated to be poly(A). The poly(A)-rich RNA was found associated with small polyribosomes and monoribosomes that were inactive in protein synthesis. It was suggested that the poly(A) segment of the RNA is formed by the poly(A) polymerase previously found in vaccinia virus cores and that the inactive RNA, by competing with host mRNA, may contribute to the virus-mediated inhibition of host protein synthesis observed in the presence of actinomycin D.
