The combination of SMZ-TMP has recently been introduced in Congo. This year (1978), it is very used by many Physicians. To help the congolese Physicians working without antibiogram frequently, we have tested 780 strains from August 1977 to August 78. The susceptibility of these strains was: for E. coli 90%, Klebsiella 69,20%, Staphylococcus 93% and for all strains studied Gram + and Gram - the percentage was 75,51. As many authors have showed, the strains of Pseudomonas, Streptococcus faecalis and Providencia are resistant. Our results remain similar to the results obtained by some french and african authors from 1970 to 1975.
