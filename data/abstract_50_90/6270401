UNLABELLED: Fundamental and clinical studies were made on cefotaxime (CTX), a new cephalosporin antibiotic. The following results were obtained: 1. Antibacterial activity: At a concentration of 3.13 mcg/ml, CTX inhibited the growth of 90.2% of 92 strains of Gram-negative rods and 80.0% of 15 strains of Gram-positive cocci. 2. Concentrations of CTX in body fluids and genital organs after 2 g i.v.: (1) CTX level in pus reached the peak (5.6mcg/ml) at 2 hours after administration. (2) Mean CTX levels in the pelvic space exudate reached the peak (28.0 mcg/ml) at 2 hours after administration. (3) CTX levels in the uterine appendages and uterus reached the peak (8.9 and 4.5 mcg/g, respectively) at 100 to 280 minutes after administration. 3. CLINICAL RESULTS: CTX was excellent in 7 of 13 cases and good in the remaining 6 cases. The response rate to CTX was 100%. 4. The bacteriological effect: The bacteriological effect of CTX was also 100%. Bacteria were eradicated in 7 of the 10 cases where organisms were demonstrated before CTX treatment. Partial reduction bacteria was observed in the remaining 3 cases. 5. No side effect attributable to CTX was observed.
