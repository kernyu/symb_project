A total of 10 actinomycetous strains isolated from the root nitrogen-fixing tubercles and rhizosphere of alder were studied with respect to their sensitivity to 17 widely used antibiotics. By their cultural and morphological properties the isolates belonged to 3 groups. The strains were characterized by multiple resistance to the antibiotics. They were resistant to nalidixic acid, clindamycin and lincomycin and sensitive to novobiocin and vancomycin. Their behaviour with respect to the other antibiotics was diverse. The resistance spectra were specific of the strains belonging to groups I and II. The strains of group III were more heterogeneous by the character of their antibiotic sensitivity. The results of the study may be used for development of selective conditions for isolation of unusual actinomycetes from the alder tubercles and rhizosphere. The data on the diverse effect of some antibiotics on the growth and development of aerial mycelium of the strains belonging to group III may be used in the studies on cell differentiation of actinomycetes.
