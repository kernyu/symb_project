Temperature-sensitive mutants of vesicular stomatitis virus (Indiana serotype) rapidly induced resistance in mice to intranasal challenge infection with the highly virulent wild-type homotypic virus, and to a lesser extent with the heterotypic New Jersey serotype. Intranasal vaccination with mutant tsG44 (IV) resulted in early appearance (at 12 h) of a bronchial inhibitor which protected mouse L cells and chick embryo cells against infection with vesicular stomatitis virus. This bronchial inhibitor was inactivated by trypsin but did not exhibit the properties of immunoglobulins, defective-interfering virus or virus glycoprotein. It was active in both chick and mouse cells and was relatively labile to acid and heat, but the antiviral activity of this bronchial inhibitor was neutralized by a goat antiserum to type I mouse interferon.
