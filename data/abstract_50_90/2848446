The in vitro susceptibilities of a group of 93 isolates of Bacteroides fragilis collected from 1983 to 1984 to six fluoroquinolones were compared with those of a group of 93 isolates collected from 1986 to 1987. The recently collected strains were less susceptible than the older strains to all of the agents tested. Norfloxacin-resistant (MIC, greater than 100 micrograms/ml) strains were less susceptible to cefoxitin and piperacillin than norfloxacin-susceptible strains.
