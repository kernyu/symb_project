Tetracycline resistance and hydrogen sulfide production have been previously found to be plasmid-mediated in a naturally-occurring strain of Escherichia coli; both functions are specified by a single conjugative plasmid called pIP231(Te-H2S); pIP231DNA was isolated as covalently closed molecules in dye-buoyant density gradients. The base ratio of the DNA was found to be 50% GC by density gradient analysis. Electron micrographs of plasmid molecules showed a contour length of 20 +/- 2 mum (40 +/- 4 X 10(6) daltons). Between one and two copies of pIP231 molecules per host chromosome were found in E. coli K12.
