Hemophilus influenzae soft tissue infections produce a variety of specific and dangerous pathologic manifestations in the head and neck. Problems include periorbital cellulitis and abscess, sinusitis, supraglottitis and otitis media. Complications include meningitis, airway obstruction and death. Pediatric patients are especially susceptible to these infections and complications. Effective management includes correct diagnosis, prevention of complications, and high doses of appropriate antibiotics. Increasing ampicillin resistance necessitates alternative antibiotic regimens. Specific physical findings, diagnostic studies and appropriate current treatments are discussed with illustrative cases from Children's Hospital Medical Center, Boston, and reference to pertinent recent literature.
