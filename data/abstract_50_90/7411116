The naturally occurring transmissible plasmid pAV1 mediates chromosome transfer and can exhibit two distinct levels of transmissibility in Acinetobacter calcoaceticus strain EBF65/65. The two states of pAV1 have been arbitrarily designated pAV1a (low frequency variant) and pAV1b (high frequency variant). Both variants have the same incompatibility and host range properties and each mobilizes two non-transmissible resistance determinants for tetracycline and neomycin. Sex factor activity has been shown to be stable: however, pAV1b fertility variants can be derived from pAV1a donors following conjugal transfer of pAV1 into new recipient strains of EBF65/65.
