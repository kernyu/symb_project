Resistance to five antiseptics was compared in a group of JK coryneform isolates containing plasmids with resistance in cured derivatives of these isolates and in non-JK coryneforms. No evidence of plasmid-mediated resistance was found, but JK coryneforms were more resistant to some antiseptics, particularly DNA-binding compounds, than non-JK coryneforms.
