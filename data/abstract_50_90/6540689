The sensitivity of leukemic marrow cell DNA synthesis to cytosine arabinoside (araC) exposure in vitro was studied in specimens obtained from patients with acute non-lymphocytic leukemia. Cells from patients who had been treated with araC in the past were more likely to be resistant to the effect of araC on DNA synthesis than cells obtained from patients who had not been so-treated previously. Resistance to the effects of araC on DNA synthesis was associated with the failure of high-dose araC therapy to induce remissions in relapsed patients, whereas remission induction failure in previously untreated patients was not associated with araC resistance.
