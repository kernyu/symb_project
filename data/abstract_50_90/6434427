The ability of antigen-responsive, thymus-derived lymphocytes to produce immune (gamma) interferon was investigated during the development and expression of cellular immunity to Rickettsia tsutsugamushi. C3H/HeDub mice infected subcutaneously with the Gilliam strain developed the ability to produce serum interferon in response to intravenously inoculated antigen which correlated with the development of resistance to intraperitoneal rechallenge. Antigen-responsive lymphocytes, measured by interferon production and proliferation, were first apparent in draining lymph node cells, but spleen cell responses were detectable relatively soon after the appearance of reactive lymph node cells. The peak spleen cell response was of a greater magnitude and was found to be relatively long-lived. Reactivity to heterologous strains of R. tsutsugamushi also developed after immunization and paralleled the homologous responses, although reactivity was greatest to homologous antigens. Responses to heterologous strains differed in magnitude and time of appearances; however, immune mice resisted challenge with all strains of R. tsutsugamushi tested.
