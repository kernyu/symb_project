The pharmacological effects of fosfomycin sodium, a new antibiotic agent, were studied on central nervous system, neuromuscular junction, isolated smooth muscles, blood coagulation, red blood cell resistance, body temperature, permeability of skin vessels and IgG and IgE antibody formation in laboratory animals. Fosfomycin sodium inhibited activities on the isolated smooth muscles, elevated body temperature, and increased permeability of skin vessels. Any of these actions, however, was noticeable only when it was administered in higher doses. Except for these above effects, fosfomycin sodium did not show any actions. Consequently, it can be concluded that fosfomycin sodium has no specific pharmacological actions.
