Colloidal bismuth subcitrate (CBS) is a drug used in the treatment of duodenal ulcer; it acts mainly by increasing mucosal resistance against endoluminal aggressive agents, without inhibiting gastric secretion. In previous clinical trials, CBS solution induced healing rates significantly higher than placebo and similar to those observed with cimetidine. In spite of these promising results, the drug has never been widely employed, mainly because of its unpleasant taste, which greatly reduced patient compliance. For this reason, chewing tablets have been introduced. CBS tablets have been reported to induce healing rates significantly higher than placebo and similar to those obtained with CBS solution, cimetidine, and ranitidine. CBS may therefore represent an important alternative to antisecretory drugs in the therapy of duodenal ulcer patients.
