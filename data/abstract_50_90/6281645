We collected serotyped isolates of salmonella from reference laboratories in the United States, tested their susceptibility to antibiotics, and extracted plasmids from isolates that were resistant to a different combination of antibiotics from each of three serotypes. Restriction-endonuclease digestion showed that within each of the three groups, plasmid molecules from animal and human isolates were often identical or nearly identical. One serotype-plasmid combination appeared to be endemic in cattle in 20 states and infected 26 persons in two states. The human cases, which were not recognizably related except for their common plasmids, appeared to be clustered in time but geographically dispersed, like cases in previous outbreaks spread by food products. These findings suggest that resistance plasmids may be extensively shared between animal and human bacteria, and that spread of multiresistant strains of salmonella among animals and human beings, as observed in Britain, may have been undetected in the United States for lack of comparable surveillance.
