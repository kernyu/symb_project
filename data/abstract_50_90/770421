Single and tandem insertions of prophage lambda into R100 have been isolated. Insertions into the transfer genes, insertions into the transfer control gene finO, and insertions into regions that result in no detectable phenotypic change were found. From the last type, deletion mutants were isolated which established the sequence of antibiotic resistance genes as tet-cml-fus-str-sul-mer in R100. High frequency transducing phage preparations lambdamer, lambdasul str, and lambdasul str cml were also isolated from this type.
