Ninety-three children from four pediatric practices, with clinical and bacteriologic evidence of acute Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis (GABHS) randomly received cefuroxime axetil (60 cases) or phenoxymethyl penicillin (33 cases). Cefuroxime axetil was given twice daily (125 mg). Phenoxymethyl penicillin was given three times daily (250 mg). The treatment groups were similar. Throat cultures were routine 2 to 7 days after the start of therapy and 2 days and 14 days after the end of therapy. The bacterial cure rates were 85 percent (51/60) for cefuroxime axetil, and 88 percent (29/33) for phenoxymethyl penicillin treated patients. Clinical results were comparable in both treatment groups. It was concluded that cefuroxime axetil given twice daily is as effective as phenoxymethyl penicillin given three times daily in producing bacteriologic eradication and clinical symptomatic improvement in children with GABHS.
