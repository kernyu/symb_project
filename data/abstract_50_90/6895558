Field results from a commercial goat herd, based on egg counts and larval differentiation, suggested that anthelmintic resistance was present to albendazole, fenbendazole, levamisole, morantel, naphthalophos and phenothiazine. When the isolate was tested in sheep, using levamisole or oxfendazole, a possible resistance was shown for Trichostrongylus sp but no resistance was demonstrated in Haemonchus or Ostertagia spp. Ivermectin at a dose rate of 100 micrograms/kg was more than 98 per cent efficient in removing the adults of each of the three species of nematode. The phenomenon relating to the influence of the host on anthelmintic resistance is discussed.
