An attempt has been made to screen the resistant strains of M. leprae in lepromatous patients from the eight northern States of India. By using the mouse foot pad technique it was found that in a total of 69 clinically suspected patients 33 (47.8%) harboured M. leprae with some degree of dapsone resistance. A detailed epidemiological study in these parts of the country may reveal the prevalence rate.
