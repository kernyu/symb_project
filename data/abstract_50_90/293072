Compound preparations containing trimethoprim and sulphonamide have been available in the pharmacies of the GDR since 1974. These are the preparations Berlocombin 200 (trimethoprim + sulphamerazine) and Sulprim 120 and 480 (trimethoprim + sulphamethoxazole) which are of great efficacy and have a broad spectrum of action. The mode of action, side-effects, dosage, commercial dosage forms and contraindications are described. Clinical tests have shown that a success-rate of 80.3% may be expected from treating pyogenic processes. Compound preparations of this kind might fill, at least in part, the gap caused by the increasing ineffectiveness of penicillin which is due to bacterial resistance.
