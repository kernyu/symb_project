A case of meningitis in a neonate caused by vancomycin-resistant Leuconostoc mesenteroides is presented. This case was complicated by severe ventriculitis and was ultimately fatal. Infection with Leuconostoc spp. is rare but should be suspected when vancomycin-resistant organisms resembling streptococci are isolated. Previous reports of this infection are reviewed.
