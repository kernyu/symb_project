Stable clones selected for resistance to tunicamycin (TM) have been isolated from Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells. The TMR phenotype is stable for more than nine months in the absence of the drug. The morphology of TMR mutant varies from epitheloid to abnormally elongate. The mutants do not display cross-resistance for ConA but are slightly cross-resistant to PHA. Biochemically labeled membrane proteins and glycoprotein of Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) grown in the TMR mutants revealed that the incorporation of radioactive glucosamine was markedly reduced in the mutants. The results indicate that TMR cells are a novel type of membrane mutant.
