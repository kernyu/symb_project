1. Experiments to determine the point of commitment to sporulation were carried out by restoring nutrients at different times to suspensions of sporulating Bacillus subtilis. 2. No single point of commitment to the process as a whole was found. Instead, the cells became committed in turn to the following successive events connected with sporulation: formation of alkaline phosphatase, development of refractility, synthesis of dipicolinic acid and development of heat-resistance. 3. Each point of commitment was followed within about 30min. by a period in which the event concerned ceased to be inhibited by actinomycin D. 4. The implication of these results is that each point of commitment is probably due to the formation of a species of long-lived messenger RNA and that, in any case, sporulation is regulated at the level of both transcription and translation. 5. It is also shown that sporulation and growth are perhaps not mutually exclusive functions and that histidase, an enzyme typical of the vegetative state, can be induced in sporulating suspensions.
