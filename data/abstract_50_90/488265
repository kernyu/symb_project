Colchicine-resistant plant cell strains have been isolated from cell suspensions of carrot and sycamore. In the same way as colchicine-resistant animal cell strains, they show an increased resistance towards streptomycin and N-methylalanine. Cultivation under non selective conditions leads to a slow progressive loss of the resistance.
