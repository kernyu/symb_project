The third part of our 3-years' continuous investigation on the clinical effect of cefaclor (CCL) against urinary tract infections was reported herein. CCL, a daily dose of 0.75 g t.i.d., has been applied for the treatment of (I) 69 cases with the uncomplicated acute cystitis in the women, and (II) 44 cases with the complicated. Rates of effectiveness obtained were 94.2% in (I), which was a little lower than the first or the second part of our report, and 70.5% in (II), which equaled the mean value of our first and second reports. Any definite difference was not obtained between the effectiveness rates in those who had ever been treated with CCL and those who not, in both (I) and (II) groups.
