Carbenicillin and ticarcillin are penicillins which were initially developed as agents to treat serious Pseudomonas infections in the seriously ill hospitalized patient. These drugs have made a major contribution to improved survival in the neutropenic patients with Pseudomonas infection, the burn patient and to the care of the patient with cystic fibrosis. Areas of use for the compounds have enlarged to include aspiration pneumonitis in hospitalized patients, intra-abdominal and pelvic sepsis, and infections due to Proteus and Enterobacter species. Careful attention to the pharmacology of the agents is necessary to achieve clinical and bacteriologic success and to avoid the toxic side-effects such as bleeding and hypokalemia associated with the use of these agents. A decade of use has shown that the agents have remained effective agents in institutions in which their use has not been abused. It is too early to clearly position azlocillin, mezlocillin, and piperacillin. In the next few years the role of these potent compounds will be established. As noted in this review, these three agents have been used with success to treat all of the aforementioned infections. With these drugs it is also essential that the physician closely correlate in vitro data and the human pharmacology of the drugs if he or she wishes to achieve the most effective response from the agents.
