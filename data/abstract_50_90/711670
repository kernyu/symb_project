Four chloramphenicol resistance (Cm) and four tetracycline resistance (Tc) plasmids from Staphylococcus aureus were characterized by restriction endonuclease mapping. All four Tc plasmids had molecular masses of 2.9 megadaltons (Mdaltons) and indistinguishable responses to seven different restriction endonucleases. The four Cm plasmids (pCW6, pCW7, pCW8, and pC221) had molecular masses of 2.6, 2.8, 1.9, and 2.9 Mdaltons, respectively. The four Cm plasmids also differed both in the level of resistance to Cm and in susceptibility to retriction endonucleases. Single restriction endonuclease sites contained within each plasmid included the following: in pCW6 for HindIII, XbaI, HpaII, and BstEII; in pCW7 for HindIII, BstEII, BglII, HaeIII, and HpaII; in pCW8 for HindIII, HaeIII, and HpaII; in pC221 for HindIII, BstEII, and EcoRI. The molecular cloning capabilities of pCW8 and pC221 were determined. Cm and erythromycin resistance (Em) recombinant plasmids pCW12, PCW13, and pCW14 were constructed and used to transform S. aureus 8325-4. A 2.8-Mdalton HindIII fragment from plasmid pI258 was found to encode Em resistance and contain single sites for the retriction endonucleases BglII, PstI, HaeIII, and HpaII. The largest EcoRI fragment (8 Mdaltons) from pI258 contained the HindIII fragment encoding Em resistance intact. Cloning of DNA into the BglII site of pCW14 did not alter Em resistance. Cloning of DNA into the HindIII site of pCW8 and the HindIII and EcoRI sites of pC221 did not disrupt either plasmid replication of Cm resistance.
