Control of rabbit dysentery in three-to 10-week-old growing-broiler rabbits was attempted by individual therapy of diseased animals and prophylactic flock treatment. Antibiotics selected on the basis of previous resistance tests failed on both therapeutic and preventive application, but a notable reduction of losses could be achieved by prophylactic medication with coccidiostatics. Clinically ill animals did not, however, respond to coccidiostatic therapy. Analysis of intestinal bacterium flora in the diseased animals and the good results of preventive coccidiostatic treatment suggests that the basic mechanism underlying rabbit dysentery is coccidial infection.
