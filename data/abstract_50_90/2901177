The effect of neuromediators (DA, GABA) of the neostriatum on the immunogenesis has been studied in 50 noninbred white rats of both sexes weighing 150-200 g, using a new non-cannula method of microinjection of substances into the predetermined brain structures. The results obtained have demonstrated that stimulation of the dopaminergic or blocking of the GABA-ergic system mediated through the impact on the function of neurohormones and cyclic nucleotides increase the body's immunological resistance. In contrast, blocking of the dopaminergic or stimulation of the GABA-ergic systems via the same mechanisms adversely affect immunogenesis. On the basis of the elucidated neurohumoral and immunological impairments the author recommends a pathogenetic treatment of alcoholism taking into account the patients' clinical status. The author points to inadvisability of the use of neuroleptics and GABA-positive drugs for suppressing the pathological craving for alcohol.
