The cloning of the nosiheptide resistance gene (nos) from S. actuosus, which produces this antibiotic, in plasmid pS10147 was carried out in S. lividans. The nosipheptide resistant clones contained the plasmid pNS1. It deletion derivative plasmid, pNS2, confers nosiheptide resistance to both S. ambofaciens and S. lividans.
