One hundred and eighty-four male patients with uncomplicated gonorrhea were treated in a randomized double-blind trial using two drug regimens. The combinations used were co-trimoxazole (trimethoprim, 80 mg and sulfamethoxazole, 400 mg) and TMP-SDZ (sulfadiazine, 400 mg and trimethoprim, 80 mg). In 43 patients who received eight tablets of co-trimoxazole in a single dose the cure rate was 88%. In the 46 patients who received a second dose of eight tablets 24 hours later the cure rate was 100%. When TMP-SDZ was used according to the same schedule the respective cure rates were 85% (41 patients) and 86% (35 patients). It is suggested that the two-dose regimen with co-trimoxazole is very effective in the treatment of uncomplicated urethral gonorrhea in the male and that the single-dose regimen, although less effective, may well prove adequate in patients defaulting after the initial treatment. At the present time, and with our local conditions, this form of treatment should be reserved for patients sensitive to penicillin or whose infections are resistant to this agent. The attack rate for patients having an episode of gonorrhea in the 12-month period immediately preceding the trial bore a direct relation to the outcome of therapy. It was highest (26%) in the group with an unsatisfactory outcome and lowest(4.3%) in the group with the highest cure rate. No adverse toxic reactions to the drug were recorded.
