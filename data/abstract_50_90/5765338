Spore heat resistance is largely an inducible property, chemically reversible between a sensitive and resistant state. Therefore, the constitutive assumption and common practices based on it, such as direct testing of spores for heat resistance without prior treatment and the assumption of logarithmic death for spores in general, are no longer appropriate. A new approach is reported to the reduction of heating severity for a given survivor reduction of bacterial spores suspended in complex biological mixtures at their ordinary pH. Heating time advantages amount to severalfold and do not involve antimicrobial additives.
