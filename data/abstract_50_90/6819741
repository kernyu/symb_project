Between January 1978 and August 1981, 4,708 examinations for detection of Neisseria gonorrhoeae were carried out at the Gynaecological Hospital of Karl-Marx Universitat Leipzig. Certain aspects relating to laboratory diagnosis of gonorrhoea are expounded, against the findings obtained from these examinations.--Culturing yield was increased by the factor of 2.6, from 4.8 per cent (1978/1979) to 12.3 per cent (1980/1981) by improvement of culturing media. Substrate quality proved to be essential to effectiveness of culturing.--Most of the above examinations, relating to 45 per cent of all positive cases, had been performed for adnexitis. The cervix was confirmed to be the most useful site from which to take swabs. Eighty-five per cent of gonococcal strains isolated in 1980 and 1981 were sufficiently responsive to penicillin. Beta-lactamase formers were not recorded. Methods and culturing media are described in some detail.
