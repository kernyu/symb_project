Ultraviolet-sensitive and wild-type Haemophilus influenzae cells were exposed to irradiated and unirradiated transforming deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) containing a marker which can be linked to another marker in the cells. Lysates were made after various times of incubation and assayed for transforming activity on an excisionless recipient. Repair can be noted as an increase in activity from the irradiated donor DNA after its linkage to the recipient DNA. No repair can be observed in a mutant which is unable to integrate transforming DNA. There is a little repair in another mutant which is unable to excise pyrimidine dimers. H. influenzae cells also repair nondimer damage, as judged by the increase in activity observed in lysates made with irradiated and maximally photoreactivated DNA.
