Inoculation of mature gerbils with BCG gave protection to subsequent infection with B. divergens when inoculated by the intracardiac and intraperitoneal routes, the latter showing a dose dependent relationship. BCG vaccination was most effective in immature gerbils (less than 4 weeks old), which are innately resistant to B. divergens. Vaccination of gerbils with killed Propionesbacterium acne and zymosan A failed to elicit a protective response, which contrasts conspicuously with rodent babesia studies. Incubation of B. divergens-infected gerbil blood with hydrogen peroxide produced parasite inhibition only at the highest concentration and treatment of parasitized gerbils with the oxidative radical inducer, alloxan monohydrate, gave equivocal results so it is evident that, unlike Plasmodium spp., B. divergens is not significantly susceptible to the action of reactive oxygen forms.
