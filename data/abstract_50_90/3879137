A 72-year-old white man who had undergone surgical trabeculectomy and extracapsular cataract extraction with a posterior-chamber lens implantation in the left eye suffered from chronic iridocyclitis for eight months. He subsequently presented with acute hypopyon and vitritis. Anterior-chamber and vitreous cultures were positive for Pseudomonas cepacia. The infection was successfully treated with subconjunctival piperacillin, intravitreal cefotaxime, and intravenous piperacillin and gentamicin. To our knowledge, this is the first documented case of Pseudomonas cepacia endophthalmitis.
