A coryneform bacteria known as Corynebacterium group D2 pending definitive taxonomic classification, has emerged as a human pathogen. Although first described 16 years ago, the organism has only recently been implicated in clinical infections. It differs from all previously recognized species of Corynebacterium, and in common with Corynebacterium jeikeium exhibits a broad spectrum of antimicrobial resistance, being sensitive to only vancomycin, teicoplanin and some quinolones. The microorganisms is mainly involved in urinary tract infections, and its strong urease activity seems to play an important role in its pathogenicity. Corynebacterium jeikeium and group D2 are very different from the clinical and microbiological point of view. Corynebacterium group D2, like other coryneform bacteria, may be isolated from healthy skin in hospitalized patients, mainly females, while Corynebacterium jeikeium is more prevalent in males. Microbiologists should be aware that such a slow-growing microorganism may be responsible for clinical infections and should not be overlooked in routine cultures of clinical specimens.
