Five patients with long-standing visceral leishmaniasis who were unresponsive to sodium stibogluconate, 20 mg antimony/kg body-weight once or twice daily, were treated for 14 to 54 days with a combination of sodium stibogluconate at the same dose plus allopurinol at a dose of 20 mg/kg body-weight per day in three divided doses. This combination was safe and effective. Negative splenic aspirate smears were obtained from all patients within 19 days, and none has relapsed in at least 12 months of follow-up.
