We have mapped the Escherichia coli ksgB gene to min 36.5, 0.8 min from man and 0.7 min from aroD. A new kasugamycin resistance (Ksgr) gene, ksgD, has been isolated, using a transposon, Tn5. ksgD::TN5 is 44% cotransducible with sbcA, unlinked to trp, and unlinked to man (by P1 transduction). The ksgD::Tn5 has a late time of entry from HfrB7 (PO43). These data place ksgD clockwise from sbcA (which enters early from HfrB7) at min 30.4. The reistance of ksgB ksgD single and double mutant strains has been quantitated. Single mutations, ksgB or ksgD, gave resistance to 600 micrograms of kasugamycin per ml, whereas a ksgB ksgD strain was able to grow in the presence of kasugamycin levels in excess of 3,000 micrograms/ml. This indicates that the mechanisms of resistance coded for by the two genes are independent and synergistic.
