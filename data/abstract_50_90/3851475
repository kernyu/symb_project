The Sceptor system and the susceptibility of Gram-positive cocci and Gram-negative rods to several antibiotics were presented. The accuracy of methicillin and gentamicin MIC of Staphylococcus aureus was determined. The MIC of methicillin-resistant strain was less than 8 mg/l. Finally the MIC accuracy to 29 Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains was compared with the results obtained by the standard disk diffusion method.
