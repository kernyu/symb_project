Plasmids from E. coli strains of 38 donors were transconjugated to common recipient SY663 Escherichia coli K12. The restriction patterns of the isolated plasmids were highly heterogenous. However, the streptomycin (Sm) resistance genes of the plasmids were identical or closely homologous in 29 of the 33 plasmids conferring Sm resistance. These data were based on Southern blot analysis, using the Sm resistance gene (encoding aminoglycoside phosphoryl transferase) as probe cut out from pBP1 plasmid. Our data suggest an extensive spreading of streptomycin resistance gene of this type.
