Strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa resistant to gentamicin, tobramycin, streptomycin, and sulphonamide have been isolated from patients at two Sydney hospitals. The multiple resistance of all these strains was due to a transmissible plasmid. The significance of the identification of this plasmid, in this variety of strains and at two hospitals, for the treatment of Ps. aeruginosa infections is discussed.
