Three UV-sensitive (UVs) mutants isolated from a CHO cell line were analyzed for survival after exposure to H2O2, EMS, MMC, CCNU, X-rays and for mutation induction after UV-irradiation. The UVs mutants showed normal sensitivities to EMS and H2O2, whereas they were hypersensitive to the bifunctional alkylating agents MMC and CCNU and to hypoxic X-irradiation. Compared to parental cells, one of the UV-sensitive clones showed approximately 3- and 7-fold enhancement in the mutagenic response per unit UV dose for 6-thioguanine and ouabain resistance, respectively.
