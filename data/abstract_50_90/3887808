While making allowance for the changes in defining the term disinfection during the last few decades the present understanding of this term is explained. Moreover the prerequisites to be satisfied for proper disinfection, especially in the light of the new guidelines of the DGHM, are dealt with. This covers both the types of germs to be affected by the methods and the various modes of disinfection. As known routes of transmission obtaining with infectious hospitalism are also included in the discussion, an attempt is made to assign priorities to certain methods of disinfection, depending on the extend to which they are capable of preventing the transmission of microorganisms. The same criteria are applied to the areas outside the hospital (medical and dental practices, residential quarters, kitchen etc.) Finally it is attempted ro provide a forecast of the future importance of disinfection, with special emphasis on chemical disinfection. Known limitations and others to be expected, such as those imposed by the toxicity of the substances used, the resistance to such substances developed by micro-organisms, material incompatibilities, irreconcilable relationships between concentration and time of action and the like, are discussed.
