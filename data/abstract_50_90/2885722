Yeast strain 990 carries a mutation mapping to the oli1 locus of the mitochondrial genome, the gene encoding ATPase subunit 9. DNA sequence analysis indicated a substitution of valine for alanine at residue 22 of the protein. The strain failed to grow on nonfermentable carbon sources such as glycerol at low temperature (20 degrees C). At 28 degrees C the strain grew on nonfermentable carbon sources and was resistant to the antibiotic oligomycin. ATPase activity in mitochondria isolated from 990 was reduced relative to the wild-type strain from which it was derived, but the residual activity was oligomycin resistant. Subunit 9 (the DCCD-binding proteolipid) from the mutant strain exhibited reduced mobility in SDS-polyacrylamide gels relative to the wild-type proteolipid. Ten revertant strains of 990 were analyzed. All restored the ability to grow on glycerol at 20 degrees C. Mitotic segregation data showed that eight of the ten revertants were attributable to mitochondrial genetic events and two were caused by nuclear events since they appeared to be recessive nuclear suppressors. These nuclear mutations retained partial resistance to oligomycin and did not alter the electrophoretic behavior of subunit 9 or any other ATPase subunit. When mitochondrial DNA from each of the revertant strains was hybridized with an oligonucleotide probe covering the oli1 mutation, seven of the mitochondrial revertants were found to be true revertants and one a second mutation at the site of the original 990 mutation. The oli1 gene from this strain contained a substitution of glycine for valine at residue 22. The proteolipid isolated from this strain had increased electrophoretic mobility relative to the wild-type proteolipid.
