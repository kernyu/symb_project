Sultamicillin (SBTPC) is a combined drug of ampicillin (ABPC) and sulbactam (SBT) which is an inhibitor of beta-lactamase, in a clinical form of tosylate with equivalent molecules in ester linkages. A tablet form of this combined drug has been released since July, 1987 in Japan and now a granular form for pediatric patients has been developed. Hence, the granular form of SBTPC was administered to 6 boys (age: 8 years 5 months-11 years 5 months) to determine plasma and urinary concentrations of the drug and its urinary recovery-rates. The dose of 10 mg/kg or 15 mg/kg was given orally just after meal to 3 boys. To study clinical and bacteriological effects of this drug, a mean daily dose of 27.1 mg/kg divided 2-4 times a day was administered for 9 days on the average to a total of 57 cases with pharyngitis (5), tonsillitis (5), laryngitis (1), bronchitis (1), pneumonia (8), scarlet fever (1), typhoid fever (1), impetigo (16), furuncle (2), abscess (6), lymphadenitis (1) and urinary tract infection (10) except 2 cases which were unevaluable for clinical effects. MICs of 7 drugs (SBTPC, ABPC, SBT, methicillin (DMPPC), cloxacillin (MCIPC), cephalexin and cefaclor) against 12 of 22 strains isolated from patients with infections of skin and soft tissue were determined with inoculum-sizes of 10(8) and 10(8) CFU/ml to study beta-lactamase producing activities. Adverse reactions and abnormal effects on laboratory test values attributable to this drug were studied in patients including dropped-out cases. The results obtained are summarized as follows. 1. Mean plasma peak levels of ABPC and SBT were observed at 1 hour after administration in both of the 10 mg/kg and the 15 mg/kg groups with values of 2.34 and 5.57 micrograms/ml for ABPC and 1.87 and 4.66 micrograms/ml for SBT, respectively. Mean concentrations of SBT were lower than those of ABPC in both groups and individuals. Dose-responses in plasma levels and AUCs were observed in both groups. Mean half-life values of ABPC and SBT in the 2 groups were 1.93 and 1.12 hours for ABPC and 1.97 and 1.22 for SBT, respectively. Mean half-life values for ABPC and SBT were similar in each group and this tendency was also seen among individuals.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
