In a prospective study in young women, novobiocin-resistant subgroup-3 micrococci were the second commonest cause, after Escherichia coli; of acute urinary infections. Proteus mirabilis was the only other causative organism. Symptoms, pyuria, or possible aetiological factors were the same in micrococcal and coliform infections. The infecting micrococcus "biotype" was only rarely found among the normal flora of the genitourinary tract of young women, though other micrococci and staphylococci were commonly present. Evidently, the infecting micrococci are selectively pathogenic in the urinary tract. Micrococcal infections, like coliform infections; commonly followed sexual intercourse, but there was no evidence that the micrococci were sexually transmitted. The infecting biotype was rarely found in the male urethra or prepuce.
