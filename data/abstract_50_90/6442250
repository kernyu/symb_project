To analyse the control of chloramphenicol (Cm) resistance conferred by the Staphylococcus aureus plasmid pUB112, a detailed restriction map of this plasmid has been constructed, and the position and orientation of the cat gene have been determined. An MboI restriction fragment carrying the entire cat gene of pUB112 was then cloned in another S. aureus plasmid, the kanamycin (Km) resistance vector pUB110. Depending on the orientation of the incorporated cat fragment, the level of Cm resistance varied dramatically in Bacillus subtilis cells. This effect could not be eliminated by deleting parts of the vector DNA, and only the introduction of a transcription termination signal led to orientation-independent Cm resistance. One such construct was further developed to yield a shuttle vector, replicating both in Escherichia coli and B. subtilis. Using this vector the expression of incorporated genes can be determined in both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. By in vitro transcription experiments using pUB110 DNA linearized with various restriction endonucleases as template, two pUB110 promoters could be localized and their orientations determined: one promoter controls a gene whose function is unknown, the other regulates the transcription of the KmR gene.
