The frequency of dermatophyte infections in hereditary palmo-plantar keratoderma ( HPPK ) of the Unna - Thost variety was investigated in 280 patients admitted to the Department of Dermatology, Central Hospital, Boden , during 1977-1981, and was found to be 35.0%. The distribution of fungi did not differ from that found for the total number of dermatophytes. An almost complete therapeutical resistance was found especially in Trichophyton rubrum infections, when patients were treated with micronized griseofulvin and topical econazole cream. Treatment of dermatophyte infections in HPPK with 50% propylene glycol in distilled water gave poor results but when 1% econazole nitrate was added negative cultures were found in 86.4% of the patients treated for 3 weeks.
