High sensitivity to ionizing radiation is observed in Escherichia coli radC mutants. This is not seen for H2O2-treated cells but when the polA mutation is also present, cells are more sensitive than in the presence of the recA mutation. An increase in inactivation was observed for strains tested when cells are grown in minimal medium and starvation-induced resistance is observed in H2O2-treated cells.
