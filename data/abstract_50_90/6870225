Resistance to clindamycin, erythromycin, and streptogramins in Clostridium difficile could be transferred to a susceptible strain by mixed culture at low frequencies (1 x 10(-8) to 4 - 10(-8) per donor cell). Transfer of tetracycline resistance occurred at frequencies of 3 x 10(-7) to 5 x 10(-7). No plasmid DNA involved in these transfers could be detected.
