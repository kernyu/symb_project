The influence of antibiotics on the frequency of colonization by Clostridium difficile and the presence of its cytotoxin in infants and older children was examined to determine its role in diarrheal disease. Cytotoxin was more closely associated with cases of diarrhea, both in infants and in children than the microorganism, although not significantly. The isolates were typed by means of sensitivity to bacteriophages and bacteriocins and their cytotoxigenic potential was also determined. Less than 30% of the colonized patients had toxigenic strains. A study of strain variability over a four-year period in the same hospital showed that two bacteriophage-bacteriocin types and non-toxigenic strains predominated. The common presence of non-toxigenic strains could explain in part the lack of correlation between isolation of Clostridium difficile and diarrhea. Most of the non-toxigenic strains showed moderate resistance to tetracycline, a property which might explain their ability to persist for long periods in the hospital.
