In vitro studies were performed comparing ciprofloxacin (Bay o 9867) and norfloxacin with three related organic acids. Ciprofloxacin was two to eight times more active than norfloxacin against 658 bacterial isolates representing 30 species. For all species tested, ciprofloxacin MICs for 90% inhibition were less than or equal to 2.0 micrograms ml. Additional tests with 5,994 isolates detected only 37 (0.6%) strains resistant to 2.0 micrograms of ciprofloxacin per ml and 106 (1.8%) resistant to 1.0 micrograms/ml. Only 6 (0.1%) of the 5,994 strains were resistant to 16 micrograms of norfloxacin per ml, and 129 (2.1%) were resistant to 4.0 micrograms/ml. The majority of resistant strains were streptococci or Pseudomonas spp. Resistance among the Enterobacteriaceae was extremely rare (i.e., greater than 99.8% susceptible to both drugs.
