The results presented in this paper confirm the existence of two types of tetracycline resistance in Shigella sonnei. One group of strains had a high level of resistance to tetracycline and oxytetracyline, with a variable level of minocycline resistance. The second group had a lower level of tetracycline resistance and were sensitive to minocycline. After conjugation with E. coli K12 the selected E. coli transconjugants had the same levels of resistance as the parent Sh. sonnei strain, with one exception. Sh. sonnei 87 was resistant to a high level of tetracycline, but was able to transfer only low level resistance. It is suggested that Sh. sonnei 87 carriers two plasmids: pSU1, a conjugative plasmid conferring a low level of tetracycline resistance, and pSU2, a non-conjugative plasmid which confers a high level of resistance to tetracycline.
