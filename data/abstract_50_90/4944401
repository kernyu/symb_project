Wild-type Saccharomyces cerevisiae is highly resistant to streptomycin. A histidine auxotroph was found which could grow without histidine in the presence of high concentrations of streptomycin. Selection for derivatives of this strain which could be suppressed by much lower concentrations of streptomycin yielded streptomycin-sensitive mutants which are cold-sensitive and have altered ribosomal profiles.
