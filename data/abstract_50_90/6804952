Adriamycin was coupled to polyglutaraldehyde microspheres having an average diameter of 4500 A. The coupled microspheres remained stable during incubation with cells. Full cytostatic activity was observed when the coupled adriamycin was tested with murine or human leukemia and murine sarcoma cell lines. A 10-fold increase in sensitivity was obtained with drug-resistant human leukemia cell lines. Repeated use of the coupled microspheres in the cytostatic assays did not increase their activity, indicating that these complexes can be recycled. The results suggest that coupled adriamycin sufficiently perturbs the plasma membrane to lead to cytostatic activity. It is proposed that this mode of drug delivery provides multiple and repetitious sites for drug-cell interactions. In addition, the drug-polymer complexes may overcome those forms of resistance that are the result of decreased drug binding at the cell surface.
