Results of second line chemotherapy schedules to treat refractory lymphoma have usually been poor. In this study we have treated 21 patients with advanced non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, usually heavily pretreated, with VINAP regimen. This original four drug chemotherapy combination included: Vindesine, 2 mg/m2 iv on days 1 and 2; CCNU, 40 mg/m2 oral on days 3 and 4; Cytosine arabinoside, 2.4 g/m2 iv on day 3 to 6 and methyl-Prednisolone, 80 mg/m2 on days 1 to 6. Sixteen patients (76%) showed response, including 5 (23%) who achieved a complete remission (CR). Eight patients achieved a partial remission (PR), and two patients obtained an objective response. Although the responses to VINAP regimen were dramatic and rapid in onset, usually they were of short duration except in cases of lymphosarcoma cell leukaemia. The median duration of response for patients with CR was 42 weeks and for PR 11 weeks. Toxicity was acceptable, including predictable myelosuppression, frequent mucositis and occasional polyneuritis. Neither central nervous problems nor conjunctivitis or dermatitis had been seen.
