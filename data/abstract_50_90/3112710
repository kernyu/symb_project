The comparative susceptibility of 50 isolates of enterococci and 50 isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to pefloxacin and different antibiotics was tested using MIC determination. The results showed only 6% sensitive strains of enterococci and 36% of P. aeruginosa. The high level resistant streptococci against aminoglycosides and resistant Pseudomonas strains have weakly higher MIC than sensitive strains. The activity of the combination of pefloxacin and other antibiotics was determined by a checkerboard micromethod. Fractional concentration index (FIC and FBC) show most frequently addition, uncommonly synergy.
