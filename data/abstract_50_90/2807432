Of 100 pus samples cultured from pyodermal lesions, 99 yielded positive cultures. Staphylococcus aureus alone (45%) or with beta-haemolytic streptococci (BHS, 32%) was the commonest isolate. Antimicrobial sensitivity of 71 Staph. aureus strains tested showed high degree of resistance to erythromycin (38.3%). BHS was the second common pathogen encountered. T-agglutination patterns studied in BHS group A could type 85.7 per cent of the isolates. Non-group A BHS isolated were of group G (3) and group D (1). Five pus specimens yielded obligate anaerobes mixed with aerobes. Bacteroides melaninogenicus/asacchrolyticus was isolated in 4 of 5 samples.
