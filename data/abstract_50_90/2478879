The interferon-specific cellular receptors in human cells cultures differing in sensitivity to alpha-interferon have been studied. The J-41 cells resistant to alpha-interferon are practically devoid of receptors highly specific to alpha-interferon. The coefficient of equilibrium and the number of receptors analyzed after Scatchard for J-96 culture of cells are 15.6 x 10(11) M-1 and 210 +/- 90, respectively. Evidently, resistance of J-41 cells to alpha-interferon is connected with the absence of interferon receptors and, as a consequence, inability to interferon-receptor interaction.
