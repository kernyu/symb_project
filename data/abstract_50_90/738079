A study was carried out to compare the sensitivity of 500 bacterial strains, isolated from patients with urinary tract infections, to oxolinic acid and nalidixic acid. The results showed that whilst both antibacterial agents were similar in their bacterial spectrum they were not identical in terms of cross-sensitivity or resistance. Where there was a difference in sensitivity, this was always in flavour of oxolinic acid and was particularly evident in the case of Staphylococcus, Pseudomonas, Serratia, Klebsiella, Proteus (especially P. rettgeri), and to a lesser extent Citrobacter.
