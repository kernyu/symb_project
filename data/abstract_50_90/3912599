From June 1982 to December 1983 children aged between 3 days and 5 years (average 2-1/2 years) with bacterial conjunctivitis, blennorrhea or perforated corneal ulcers were examined microbiologically. The results of 30 antibiotic susceptibility tests were compared with those of adults. Prevalence of Escherichia coli (6%) and Staphylococcus aureus haemolyticus (17%) was observed; Candida species was not found in the young children. Pediatric diseases revealed themselves to be more pronounced in general. The authors diagnosed 3 chlamydial blennorrheas in newborn aged 7, 8 and 10 days. Mixed infections were found significantly less often in children (21%) than in adults (64%). The authors point out the need for epidemiologic antibiotic susceptibility studies to facilitate decision making for ad hoc therapeutic measures that are sometimes indicated in endophthalmitis or severe blennorrhea. The possible complications of antibiotic polypragmasia and the use of fixed combinations are discussed.
