Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) is a chronic and usually fatal central nervous system disease caused by a persistent infection with measles virus. The pathogenic mechanisms of the disease are poorly understood, but restricted expression of viral antigens within the infected tissue appears to be involved. We have previously proposed that interferon (IFN) plays a role in the pathogenesis of SSPE by interacting with viral subpopulations that are relatively resistant to IFN-mediated inhibition. Such IFN-resistant viral subpopulations have now been identified in six independent strains of measles virus, two derived from patients with measles and four derived from patients with SSPE. By means of a replicative-plating procedure, these IFN-resistant viruses were found to be heterogeneous with respect to their growth in the presence of high levels of IFN. One viral form replicates fully, with complete destruction of the infected-cell culture, whereas the other form induces a restricted, self-limited form of cytopathic effect, similar to that seen with cell-associated strains of measles virus isolated from SSPE patients. Passage of a virus stock containing both of these viral forms through the central nervous system tissue of newborn hamsters strongly selects for the viral form associated with the self-limiting type of cytopathic effect. The presence of this form of IFN-resistant virus coupled with chronic production of IFN within the central nervous system may account for viral persistence in SSPE patients.
