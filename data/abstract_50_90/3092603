A clinical observation was made on 30 cases of urogenital tuberculosis diagnosed and treated at the urological department of our Hospital between January, 1976 and December, 1984. Furthermore, 20 of them were examined for drug resistance and investigated for this tendency. They accounted for 0.23% of the outpatients. Male to female ratio was 2 to 1, but on urological tuberculosis this ratio was even. The average age was 43.7 and 50% of the patients who had a history of tuberculosis. Mycobacterium tuberculosis could be detected in 24 of the 30 cases (80%) and 18 of the 21 cases (85.4%) of urological tuberculosis. Drug resistance was examined in 20 patients. The resistant ratio of M. tuberculosis against primary drugs such as SM, PAS, INAH was low and a high resistant ratio was observed on secondary drugs such as EB, RFP, TH. These clinical observations are reported and herein discussed.
