The antitumor activity and toxicity of two new 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosyl-cytosine (ara-C) conjugates of cortisol and corticosterone linked through a phosphodiester bond between the 5' and 21 positions of the respective moieties (cortisol- and corticosterone-p-ara-C) were investigated in L1210 lymphoid leukemia cells in mice. They are highly active against both i.p.- and i.c.-implanted ara-C-sensitive lymphoid leukemia in mice, exceeding the activity produced by the parent drug, ara-C. For example, corticosterone-p-ara-C exhibited the respective ILS values of 306% at 50 mg/kg/day X 9 and 294% at 75 mg/kg/day X 9 on survivals of i.p.- and i.c.-inoculated L1210 leukemic mice. The effectiveness of the conjugates seems to depend on schedules of the treatments. The 9-day continuous treatments showed a better therapeutic effectiveness than those with either a 5-day, a single or a widely spaced (q 4d., 1, 5, 9) treatment. However, they were found to be marginally effective against i.p.-implanted ara-C-resistant L1210 leukemia in mice. They were also inhibitory against proliferation of human leukemia-lymphoid cells in culture. Their superior antitumor activity and resistance to cytidine deaminase suggests that they serve as a prodrug form of ara-C or ara-CMP.
