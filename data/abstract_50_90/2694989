Forty strains of S. dysenteriae 1 isolated in the USSR within 1986-1988 were tested for their resistance to 11 antibacterial drugs. It was shown that 92.5-97.5 per cent of the isolates were resistant to chloramphenicol (Cm) and tetracycline (Tc), 22.5 per cent to streptomycin (Sm), 17.5 per cent to nalidixic acid (Nal) and 10 per cent to ampicillin (Ap) and polymyxin (Pm). Resistance to Cm Tc (51.4 per cent) and Cm Tc Nal (13.5 per cent) represented the predominating phenotype. 35 per cent of the strains carried conjugative R plasmids. In the majority of the cases, the determinants of resistance to Cm and Tc were transferred, which must define the high frequency of the strains resistant to Cm and Tc. All the tested strains were sensitive to gentamicin, neomycin, rifampicin, cefamezin and ciprofloxacin. Since the strains of S. dysenteriae 1 proved to be highly sensitive to the tested drugs it appeared possible to consider them as the drugs of choice in etiotropic therapy of patients with dysentery caused by the pathogens of the Grigoryev-Shiga group.
