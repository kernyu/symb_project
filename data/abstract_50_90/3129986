Reinfection of chronic chagasic mice after treatment with nifurtimox resulted in different outcomes according to the number of parasites used for inoculation. Nifurtimox-treated chagasic animals injected with 2,500 trypomastigotes developed higher parasitemia and increased mortality compared with nontreated chagasic mice. When reinfection was done with 25 trypomastigotes, treated and nontreated animals showed similar parasitemias and mortalities, which were significantly higher in nonchagasic controls infected for the first time. Immunological studies showed that treatment with nifurtimox led to a decrease in anti-Trypanosoma cruzi antibodies engaged in parasite destruction, inducing either complement-dependent lysis or antibody-dependent cytotoxicity, but no difference in anti-T. cruzi cell-mediated immunity was found between treated and nontreated chagasic animals. It is concluded that treatment with nifurtimox leads to a loss of resistance to reinfection with a large number of trypanosomes, which is maintained with challenge with a few parasites, and that these two thresholds of premunition are probably associated with humoral and cell-mediated anti-T. cruzi immune responses, respectively.
