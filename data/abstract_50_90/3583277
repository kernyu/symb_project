Resistance and side effects to antibiotics or other chemotherapeutic agents are the main limiting factors in the treatment of gonorrhoea. As no such side effects have been reported with a new aminoglycoside, netilmicin, the therapeutic efficiency of this substance was evaluated in 1200 patients (690 women, 510 men) with uncomplicated gonorrhoea, who each received a single dose of 300 mg netilmicin by intramuscular injection. Efficacy of treatment was assessed by smear microscopy and culture, which gave results in all 1200 patients. No serious side effects were reported. These results indicate that netilmicin is an extraordinarily safe and efficient agent for treating uncomplicated gonorrhoea.
