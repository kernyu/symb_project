Between 1961 and 1972, 4547 independent strains of Staphylococcus aureus isolated from one hospital were examined for phage type. After 1967 there was a decline in the number of strains received, which we consider reflects a decline in the number of infections in the hospital, and which was largely accounted for by a great reduction in the number of strains in four ;epidemic' types. Overall, the number of multiple-resistant staphylococci received also declined; this was in part due to the decline in the epidemic types and in part to a reduction in the proportion of multiple-resistant strains of all types.
