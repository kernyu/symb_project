The bacteriological results of 4113 clinical specimens (wound-swabs) were analysed. In 40 per cent of positive findings Staphylococcus aureus was isolated, furthermore, in decreasing frequency Staphylococcus epidermidis, Proteus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococci and haemolysing Streptococci. During this study a considerable quota of the examined strains was observed to show large fluctuation in sensitivity, but more than half of the isolates demonstrated increasing resistance against the chemotherapeutics tested. In order to reduce the development of resistance, our results ascertain the necessity for a scientific antibacterial therapy as well as the strict observance of hospital hygienic measures.
