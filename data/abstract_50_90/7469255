Staphylococcus aureus strains from poultry and S. intermedius strains from dogs were highly resistant to lincomycin and sensitive to the macrolide and streptogramin antibiotics. They were shown to degrade lincomycin and clindamycin. Their sensitivity levels to clindamycin were only marginally higher than those of sensitive control strains. S. aureus strains from pigs and cattle and one S. hyicus strain isolated from a pig showed how level resistance to lincomycin and the virginiamycin factor M. They were sensitive to clindamycin, macrolide antibiotics and virginiamycin factor S.
