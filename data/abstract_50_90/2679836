A double-blind controlled trial of norfloxacin versus cotrimoxazole in the treatment of urinary tract infections was conducted. Eighty-eight patients were recruited but data from 80 patients were analysed. Norfloxacin cured 93 per cent of the infections while the cure rate achieved by cotrimoxazole was only 70 per cent (p = 0.03, Fisher's exact test). The difference was attributable to a higher incidence of resistance to cotrimoxazole among the bacterial isolates. Escheria coli was the commonest pathogen and together with klebsiella accounted for 78 per cent of all isolates. Fifteen per cent of E coli and 15 per cent of klebsiella isolates were resistant to cotrimoxazole while all were sensitive to norfloxacin. Side effects were minimal and consisted mainly of nausea and non-specific dizziness.
