The effect of noradrenaline on the bioelectric activity of the mucous glands of 9 toads was studied by means of intraglandular recording. Noradrenaline induced a transient increase in glandular secretion and a simultaneous two-phase increase in the potential difference of the glands. Perfusion with 0.043 mM ethanol-Ringer's reversibly reduced this response. Ouabain, in concentrations which block Na+K+-activated ATPase, markedly reduced the slow phase of the response of the 'isolated skin to noradrenaline. The results suggest that ethanol acts in two ways: first by increasing the electrical resistance of the skin and secondly by partially inhibiting the active transport of sodium due to a decrease in permeability of the apical membrane of the transporting cells.
