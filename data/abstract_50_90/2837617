Sections of a cloned 27 kb segment of chromosomal DNA, associated with resistance to four antimicrobial agents in a clinical isolate of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), were tested for their ability to determine resistance when transformed into a sensitive laboratory strain of S. aureus. This was achieved by inserting the sections into a newly constructed shuttle vector, amplifying the recombinant DNA in E. coli, and transforming protoplasts of the sensitive S. aureus strain. Two sections of the cloned DNA were found to determine resistance separately to mercuric ion and to tetracycline, in both S. aureus and Escherichia coli.
