The Escherichia coli isolated from faecal and nasal swabs from all babies present in a maternity ward were serotyped and their anbitiotic resistance patterns and fermentation characteristics with six carbohydrates were determined. These were compared with E. coli isolated from hands and clothing of attendants and samples of ward air. The results suggest that mothers may be the primary source of E. coli in the ward but the colonized babies themselves provide the main reservoir of nursery E. coli. As most of these serotypes of E. coli were found on the attendant's hands or clothing or in the air, it is difficult to assess transmission routes for E. coli, particularly as some strains appear to possess a greater inherent ability to colonize babies than others. By the use of markers other than O antigens it was possible to characterize strains to a far greater extent.
