The in vitro activities of azlocillin and cefotaxime in combination and of azlocillin and tobramycin in combination against 100 blood isolates and 50 multidrug-resistant isolates were compared. With both combinations, antibacterial spectrums were complementary. Although synergy against individual strains was infrequently observed (except for azlocillin-cefotaxime against Streptococcus faecalis and azlocillin-tobramycin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa), 97% of blood isolates and 76% of multidrug-resistant isolates were susceptible to azlocillin-cefotaxime, and 94% of blood isolates and 36% of multidrug-resistant isolates were susceptible to azlocyclin-tobramycin.
