Cephalosporin antibiotics are bactericidal against most gram-positive cocci and many gram-negative bacilli of clinical importance. They are relatively nontoxic but share with penicillins a tendency to elicit hypersensitivity reactions. They are indicated in certain instances for treatment of infections in patients with penicillin allergy and are frequently chosen as one of the agents in an empiric program in life-threatening infections. Cephalosporins should not be used in infections caused by group D enterococcal streptococci, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, or Bacillus fragilis, Newer cephalosporins soon to be available have a somewhat wider gram-negative spectrum; however, as with all members of this family of drugs, in vitro susceptibility must be established.
