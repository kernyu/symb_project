Over eight months 130 isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae were examined for sensitivity to penicillin, tetracycline, cephalosporin and co-trimoxozole. Except in one doubtful case all isolates were sensitive to penicillin. All were sensitive to cephalosporin. 6.9 percent is isolates were resistant to co-trimoxozole. It is suggested that penicillin remains the drug of choice in the treatment of pneumococcal infections.
