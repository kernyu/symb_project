From 1979 to 1982, a large number of freshly isolated strains of bacteria were investigated at our institute with regard to their sensitivity to cefotaxime in comparison to other antibiotics. The isolates came from 42 clinics in the Rhine-Main region. The results of the investigations demonstrate that cefotaxime, due to its high stability against beta-lactamases, has advantages over to older cephalosporins, and even cefoperazon and cefoxitin. Despite increased use of cefotaxime, there was no change in the sensitivity of the organisms from 1979 to 1982.
