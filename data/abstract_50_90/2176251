The efficacy rate, minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs), and resistance of fluoroquinolone agents against causative organisms in respiratory tract infections from January to March, 1988 were investigated. Of 333 pathogenic strains 85% consisted of 5 major causative organisms of respiratory tract infection (Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Branhamella catarrhalis, and Staphylococcus aureus). In 61 (59 cases) of these 333 strains, including 3 cases of acute pharyngitis, 5 of acute bronchitis, 3 of pneumonia, and 48 of chronic lower respiratory tract infection fluoroquinolone agents were administered. The efficacy rate was 76.3% in all cases, and 75% in cases with chronic lower respiratory tract infection. The fluoroquinolone agents were 100% effective in H. influenzae and B. catarrhalis, though the efficacy rate was 67% in S. aureus and 40% in P. aeruginosa. The susceptibility of all strains to fluoroquinolone agents were investigated. There was no resistant strain in H. influenzae and B. catarrhalis, though resistant strains to fluoroquinolone agents have increased in S. aureus and P. aeruginosa. The efficacy rate was investigated using the MIC of administered fluoroquinolone agent against causative organisms. It is surmised that the efficacy of that agent has an MIC of 1.56-3.13 micrograms/ml.
