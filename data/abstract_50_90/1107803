A mutant has been isolated which carries a nuclear mutation capable of suppressing certain aspects of the phenotype imposed by a specific mitochondrial mutation. The mitochondrial mutation [tso-r] confers cold sensitivity to growth on nonfermentable substrates and resistance to oligomycin. When both the mitochondrial and nuclear mutations are present in the same cell the cell is phenotypically cold resistant but retains a high level of oligomycin resistance. The extent of cold sensitivity suppression is dependent upon other unspecified nuclear genes. The molecular basis for the suppression may involve interactions between cytoplasmic and mitochondrial ATPase.
