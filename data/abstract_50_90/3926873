Three strains belonging to gramnegative non-fermenting rods, i.e. a Pseudomonas maltophilia strain and two strains of Acinetobacter, were tested, as representatives of different types of nosocomial strains, for transferability of their multiple drug resistance. As all of them posed difficulties in demonstrating the transferability of their resistance by conventional methods, a three-step procedure was developed that includes a transfer to rifampicin-resistant P. aeruginosa recipients, then to susceptible P. aeruginosa intermediate strains, and, finally, from these strains to rifampicin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae. In three strains studied three genetically different types of R plasmids have been demonstrated. P. maltophilia transferred Amikacin resistance, as well as resistance to other antibiotics, to P. aeruginosa and then to Enterobacteria. In contrast, an Amikacin-resistant Acinetobacter with quite identical multiple drug resistance spectrum transferred its resistance to P. aeruginosa only, but not to Enterobacteria. Finally, another Acinetobacter strain, resistant to Gentamicin but susceptible to Amikacin transferred this resistance directly to Enterobacteria (and, separately, to P. aeruginosa, too). All three strains transferred Cefamandole resistance together with other resistances. Non-fermenting rods, thus, might be a source of transmissible resistance to reserve antibiotics as Amikacin, and advanced-type Cephalosporins.
