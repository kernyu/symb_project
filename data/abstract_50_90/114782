Today, however aminoglycosides are nearly indispensable owing to their broad antibacterial spectrum and genuine bactericidal effect as well as the possible synergic effect with beta-lactam preparations. The new cephalosporins are distinguished by a high beta-lactam stability and are active against the majority of pathogens causing nosocomial infections. An exceptional position is held by cefotaxim with its generally outstanding antibacterial potency, and by cefoxitin with its activity against Bacteroides fragilis. The ureidopenicillin azlocillin is superior to the Pseudomonas penicillins so far used. It acts against enterococci and H. influenzae as reliably as does mezlocillin.
