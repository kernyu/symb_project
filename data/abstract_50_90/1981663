The inherent blood schizontocidal activities of five antihistaminic compounds, cyproheptadine hydrochloride (CYP), ketotifen hydrogen fumarate (KET), pizotyline hydrogen maleate (PIZ), azatadine maleate (AZAT) and loratadine (LOR) were examined against the following organisms: chloroquine-sensitive (CS) Plasmodium berghei and chloroquine-resistant (CR) P. yoelii ssp. NS in mice; and CS Tak 9 clone 96 and CR K1 strain of P. falciparum in vitro. Chloroquine, verapamil and desipramine were used as comparison standards. CYP, KET, PIZ were active against the CS strain in vivo with ED90 levels between 20 and 30 mg kg-1 (given sc daily for four days). They were slightly more active against the CR strain. AZA was active, but much less so than the other compounds. LOR, verapamil and desipramine were inactive in vivo at the doses tested. Against CS P. falciparum in vitro, all five antihistaminics and desipramine were active at EC50 concentrations ranging from about 50-80 mumol l-1, while verapamil was only active at 175 mumol l-1. Against the CR strain of this parasite, CYP, PIZ and LOR were slightly more active than against the CS strain, but KET, AZAT, desipramine and verapamil were significantly less active. The action of all these compounds in combination with chloroquine was then examined both in vivo and in vitro. The ability of verapamil and desipramine to reverse chloroquine resistance in vitro was confirmed, but only a low level of reversal was seen with these compounds in vivo. However, CYP, KET, PIZ and AZAT produced a marked reversal of chloroquine resistance both in vivo and in vitro. The implications of these observations in relation to further laboratory and clinical research are discussed.
