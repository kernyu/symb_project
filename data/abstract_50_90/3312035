In 53 spinal cord injury patients with neurogenic bladder suffering from severe infections caused by multiresistant gram-negative pathogens, treatment with ceftazidime at a fixed dosage schedule of 2 g i.m. for seven days, yielded an overall cure rate of 86.5%. In view of the fact that 28 episodes (52.8%) of acute infection were caused by highly resistant strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and considering the many aggravating factors due to the recent polytrauma and paraplegia, we consider the therapeutic results as highly satisfactory. In spinal cord injury patients in whom urinary tract infections are notoriously difficult to cure, repetitive therapy with the potentially nephrotoxic aminoglycosides should be avoided. Ceftazidime offers a valuable alternative with minimal risk of drug toxicity.
