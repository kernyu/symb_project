Current methods for the "in vitro" study of antibiotic activity, as minimum inhibitory concentration, expose bacteria to constant concentrations of antibiotics. The "in vivo" situation is significantly different, since the antibiotic concentration changes with time. Pharmacokinetic models are "in vitro" experimental systems that seek to simulate conditions of exposure of bacteria to antimicrobial agents that exist in blood and tissues. All of these systems are complicated constructions. A new simple "in vitro" kinetic model, based on solid phase growth, is described.
