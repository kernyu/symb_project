In conventional in vitro tests and an experimental bladder model ciprofloxacin proved very active against 103 strains of enterobacteria isolated from infected urine. Nalidixic acid-resistant strains were less susceptible to ciprofloxacin than nalidixic acid-sensitive strains, and the activity of the drug was reduced under acid conditions. Nevertheless, all strains were inhibited by 4 mg/l of ciprofloxacin at pH 5.5. Streptococcus spp., Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Bacteroides spp. were less susceptible than enterobacteria, although most strains were inhibited by a therapeutically achievable concentration of 2 mg/l. Under conditions simulating the treatment of bacterial cystitis, changing concentrations of ciprofloxacin well within levels achievable in urine inhibited dense bacterial cultures for periods exceeding 24 hours, and surviving bacteria did not exhibit any reduction in susceptibility.
