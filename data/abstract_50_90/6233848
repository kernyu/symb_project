Human T-cell hybrids with helper activity were obtained after fusion of phytohemagglutinin-activated normal human T cells with a 6-thioguanine-resistant, aminopterin-sensitive human T-cell line. This mutant line, designated CEM-T15, was derived from the human T-cell line CEM after mutagenesis with ethyl methanesulfonate. The polyethylene glycol induced fusion and the selection in hypoxanthine- aminopeterin -thymidine medium were performed by modification of standard somatic cell hybridization techniques. After fusion, the strategy for selecting hybrids consisted in screening growing cultures for the presence of cells expressing the OKT3 cell surface differentiation antigen. OKT3 was chosen because it is present in 85-95% of normal human T cells but absent from CEM-T15 cells. Thus, OKT3+ cells growing 5-7 weeks after fusion most likely represented hybrids between normal T cells (OKT3+) and continuously growing CEM-T15 cells (OKT3-). Several of the hybrids were tested for their capacity to promote pokeweed mitogen-induced antibody production by B cells. These experiments demonstrated that many of the hybrids had helper activity. Periodical testing of these uncloned hybrids for helper activity revealed functional instability, with most of the hybrids losing helper activity after 20 weeks of continuous culture. However, early and repeated cloning of the same hybrids resulted in a series of hybrid clones with helper activity still present more than 8 months after fusion. In more recent fusions, we have demonstrated that human helper hybrids producing helper factor(s) can also be obtained. These and similar hybrids with different functions will be of considerable importance in further studies of the immunobiology of human T lymphocytes.
