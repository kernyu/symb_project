The addition of NaCl to cation-supplemented Mueller-Hinton broth increased the MICs of gentamicin, amikacin, and netilmicin for coagulase-positive and -negative staphylococci in a concentration-dependent manner. At 2% NaCl, geometric mean MICs were elevated 14.1- to 25.6-fold. Mueller-Hinton broth containing added NaCl should not be used for testing the susceptibility of staphylococci to aminoglycosides.
