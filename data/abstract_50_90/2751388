Four hundred and twenty two pneumococcal strains isolated from 300 patients with chronic nonspecific pneumonia and bronchitis were studied with respect to their sensitivity to 18 antibiotics within a period from 1982 to 1985. It was shown with the method of serial dilutions on solid media that 91.7, 87.8, 85 and 81 per cent of the isolates were sensitive to benzylpenicillin, ampicillin, lincomycin and cefuroxime, respectively. A significant percentage of the pneumococcal strains had decreased sensitivity to benzylpenicillin (MIC close to the therapeutic concentration). On this basis it was recommended to use lower concentrations of benzylpenicillin (less than 0.25 units/ml) in assay of sensitivity in clinical strains of Pneumococcus.
