Our objectives in this study were to elucidate various aspects of the epidemiology of Staphylococcus saprophyticus. This organism was isolated from the midstream urine specimens of 7.5% of 145 college women with frequency and urgency of urination and dysuria, but from only 0.07% of 14,835 urine specimens from adult inpatients at the Victoria General Hospital. It was found to be part of the urethral flora of only 2% of healthy women. Other staphylococci which formed part of the urethral flora of 100 healthy women included S. epidermidis (59 women), S. hominis (15 women), S. haemolyticus (13 women), S. warneri (9 women), and S. aureus (6 women). Finally, we determined that resistance to the 5-micrograms novobiocin disk has a 93% positive predictive accuracy as a presumptive test for S. saprophyticus.
