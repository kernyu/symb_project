Fundamental and clinical studies of cefpiramide (CPM), a new cephem antibiotic, were carried out in the field of pediatrics. 80% MICs of CPM against S. aureus, S. pyogenes, H. influenzae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa were 1.56, 0.05, 0.39, 6.25, 0.78 and 25 micrograms/ml, respectively. Serum concentration of CPM after intravenous injection at a dose of 20 mg/kg to 3 children was 103.7 +/- 9.1 micrograms/ml at 15 minutes and 13.4 +/- 5.0 micrograms/ml at 8 hours, with half-life of 3.11 +/- 0.83 hours. The excretion rate of CPM into urine was 16.40 +/- 7.31% within 8 hours. The transfer of CPM to cerebrospinal fluid was 0.1 approximately 0.2 micrograms/ml at 1 hour after intravenous injection at a dose of 20 mg/kg to patients with Aseptic meningitis, and 0.4 approximately 4.0 micrograms/ml at 1 hour approximately 3 hours 15 minutes after intravenous injection at a dose of 50 mg/kg to patients with purulent meningitis. Clinical effects of CPM on 37 patients with various infections were excellent in 28 cases, good in 6 cases, fair in 2 cases and poor in 1 case. The effective rate (excellent and good) was 91.9%. Bacteriologically, the eradication rate in 23 isolated organisms was 95.5%. No side effects and abnormalities of laboratory findings were noted. It was concluded that CPM has a broad spectrum antibacterial activity both in vitro and in vivo.
