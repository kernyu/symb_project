The in-vitro antigonococcal activity of enoxacin was measured by a broth microdilution method. Comparisons were made with five clinically relevant marketed drugs against 23 clinical isolates of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, including several penicillinase producers as well as multiply resistant strains. Results showed that enoxacin possessed potent activity against all organisms tested, with MIC values ranging from less than or equal to 0.013 to 0.05 micrograms/ml.
