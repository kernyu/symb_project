We report the spread of a methicillin- and gentamicin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strain (MGRSA) from the Middle East and its subsequent dissemination within two hospitals in Dublin. The index case, a 30-year-old male with serious blast injuries was transferred from a Baghdad hospital to a Dublin hospital in May 1985. He was heavily infected with two MGRSA strains, one of which spread and was responsible for numerous episodes of nosocomial infection. This strain was very similar to MGRSA isolates recovered in a Baghdad hospital during 1984. This imported strain has now spread to two hospitals in our group causing sepsis. This report emphasizes the difficulty of detecting an imported strain in an endemic area, but above all points to the potential for spread when there is considerable movement of patients and personnel.
