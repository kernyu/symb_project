T-2588, a new oral cephalosporin antibiotic, for gonorrheal infections, was administered to 146 patients with gonorrheal infection cases (140 urethritis cases in males, 6 cervicitis cases in females). Twenty three strains (20.9%) out of 110 clinically isolated gonococci were PPNG. The MICs of T-2588 for the clinically isolated gonococci strains showed a distribution peak at 0.025 microgram/ml and ranged between 0.0125 microgram/ml to 0.1 microgram/ml when an inoculum size of 10(6)/CFU/ml was used. The distribution of MICs of PPNG also showed a peak at 0.025 microgram/ml and the maximum MIC was 0.2 microgram/ml, which is one dilution tube higher than the maximum MIC of non-PPNG. The rate of complication by Chlamydia trachomatis was 20.9% in male and 33.3% in female. At the dose of 400 mg given 2 times a day, the efficacy rate for the males on the 3rd and 7th day was 90.5% (efficacy rate against PPNG, 73.3%) and 95.3% (80.0%), respectively. At the dose of 300 mg given 3 times a day, it was 93.3% and 100%, respectively, and at the dose of 600 mg given 3 times a day, it was 100% and 100%, respectively. Therefore, the administration of T-2588 3 times a day resulted in a higher efficacy rate than that given 2 times a day. This effect was extremely marked in the case of patients with PPNG. The best clinical results were obtained at a daily dose of 600 mg t.i.d. Although the female patients were few, in number and no conclusion can be drawn, the best results were obtained with a daily dose of 600 mg t.i.d. (100%). There were three mild side effects (1.7%), which could not be attributed to the administration of T-2588 in the present study. In conclusion, T-2588 can be to be expected sufficiently clinically effective against gonorrheal infections, including PPNG, at a daily dose of 600 mg t.i.d. for 3 days.
