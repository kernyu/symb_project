Examinations of 126 patients with staphylococcal pyodermas have helped detect a relationship between the total antibiotic sensitivity of staphylococci isolated from the involved skin and the patient's immunity status. The total antibiotic sensitivity of staphylococci in directly proportional to the blood level of T-lymphocytes, to the degree of their sensitization to staphylococcus in the leukocyte migration inhibition test, and to the value of IgM/IgG ratio. A new synthetic preparation of thymus, thymogen, had a modulating effect on the lymphocytes of pyoderma patients, manifesting by the increment of the total count of T-lymphocytes and T-helpers. A reduction of the total antibiotic resistance of the agent in foci of skin infection and normalization of the immunologic reactivity parameters were recorded in 23 patients with chronic pyodermas after a course of thymogen therapy. An effective method for the management of chronic pyoderma by a combination of thymogen with antibiotics is suggested.
