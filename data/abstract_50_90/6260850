Clinical resistance of herpetic keratitis to antiviral agents constitutes one of the reasons for failure of treatment after their administration. A retrospective study of 42 cases of superficial herpetic keratitis resistant to IDU, IDU and IDC, and Ara-A demonstrated that in 2 out of 3 cases this resistance appeared in patients previously treated locally with antiviral compounds for anterior ocular lesions. Patients resistant to IDU were then treated with Ara-A, and those not responding to Ara-A, with TFT. Resistance may be observed following this new treatment during the subsequent relapses.
