Studied were a total of 133 blood samples from 19 calves to follow up the level of cortizol from birth up to the age of 3 months (at the 4th and 24th hour, on the 10th day, and at 1 and 3 months of age). It was found that in relatively constant concentrations of the total protein the ratio of the albumin and the globulin fraction varied in accordance with the level of cortizol. The concentration of cortizol at birth was high (60.3 ng/cm3). It was demonstrated that the high level of cortizol had a suppressive action with regard to the absorption of colostral gamma-globulins. The drop of the cortizol level led to the rise of the gamma-globulin amount in the blood. The factors of unspecific resistance were also followed up, such as lysozyme and complement- and phagocyte-activity. A direct dependence was established between the cortizol level and the gamma-globulin concentration and the indices of natural resistance.
