Aztreonam (AZT), a new synthetic monocyclic beta-lactam antibiotic, which is resistant to beta-lactamase and has a strong and specific activity against aerobic Gram-negative bacteria including Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The patients of 13 cases with localized peritonitis due to acute appendicitis, 3 cases with panperitonitis (1 case with perforative appendicitis, 1 with acute cholecystitis and 1 with pancreatic necrosis) and 4 cases with skin and soft tissue infection (anal fistula and abdominal abscess etc.) were treated by AZT. AZT was administered in a dose of 1 g twice a day by intravenous drip infusion using 100 ml-volume bottle preparation with saline for 4 to 10 days. Clinical efficacy was rated excellent in 2 cases, good in 16 cases, fair in 1 case and poor in 1 case (efficacy rate 90.0%). Adverse effects were small skin rash in 1 case, and increased GOT and GPT in 1 case. No adverse effect was recognized in other cases. Therefore, AZT appears to be very useful drug when used for chemotherapy of infectious diseases in surgery.
