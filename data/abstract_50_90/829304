The sensibility of Ps. aeruginosa strains to several antibiotics has been tested in vitro. The strains have been divided into two groups: a group of 42 cases from the Hospital and a group of 31 cases from the outside. Then the percentage of resistance to each antibiotic of the cases in both groups has been calculated, and so has the significance of the differences between the percentages, whenever a difference has been found out. The strains from the Hospital have proved to be significantly more resistant to Rifampicin and to Nalidixic acid, whereas the strains from the outside have shown greater resistance to Humatin, with a semi-significant difference however. All the other differences between percentages haven't proved to be significant.
