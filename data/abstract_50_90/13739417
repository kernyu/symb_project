The resistance of cultures of Salmonella typhimurium to tetracyclines and chloramphenicol has been examined periodically. Although none of 200 cultures isolated prior to 1948 was resistant to the antibiotics, 5% of 100 cultures from man and 9% of 100 cultures from fowls which were isolated in 1956 and 1957 were resistant to tetracyclines. Among 158 cultures isolated from man and 100 cultures isolated from fowls in 1959 and 1960, 13.9 and 29%, respectively, were resistant to tetracyclines. In the last series, cultures resistant to chloramphenicol were found for the first time. Among 150 cultures of other Salmonella serotypes from man and 137 similar cultures isolated from fowls in 1959 and 1960, 5.3 and 8%, respectively, were found resistant to tetracyclines. There is no obvious explanation for the higher percentage of resistant strains occurring in S. typhimurium than in other serotypes.
