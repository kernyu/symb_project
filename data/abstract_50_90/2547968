The ability to clone a variety of sequences with varying capabilities of adopting non-B structures (left-handed Z-DNA, cruciforms or triplexes) into three loci of pBR322 was investigated. In general, the inserts were stable (non-deleted) in the EcoRI site (an untranslated region) of pBR322. However, sequences most likely to adopt left-handed Z-DNA or triplexes in vivo suffered deletions when cloned into the BamHI site, which is located in the tetracycline resistance structural gene (tet). Conversely, when the promoter for the tet gene was altered by filling-in the unique HindIII or ClaI sites, the inserts in the BamHI site were not deleted. Concomitantly, the negative linking differences of the plasmids were reduced. Also, inserts with a high potential to adopt Z-DNA conformations were substantially deleted in the PvuII site of pBR322 (near the replication origin and the copy number control region), but were less deleted if the tet promoter was insertion-mutated. The deletion phenomena are due to the capacity of these sequences to adopt left-handed Z-DNA or triplexes in vivo since shorter inserts, less prone to form non-B DNA structures, or random sequences, did not exhibit this behavior. Sequences with the potential to adopt cruciforms were stable in all sites under all conditions. These results reveal a complex interrelationship between insert deletions (apparently the result of genetic recombination), negative supercoiling, and the formation of non-B DNA structures in living Escherichia coli cells.
