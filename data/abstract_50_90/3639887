Few studies evaluating susceptibility testing of methicillin-resistant staphylococci have included isolates of Staphylococcus epidermidis, a known pathogen in many types of serious infections. We tested 175 S. epidermidis and 95 Staphylococcus aureus isolates to determine the most sensitive procedures for detecting methicillin-resistant staphylococci. Reference procedures included agar dilution with methicillin and 4% NaCl in the agar and broth microdilution with methicillin and 2% NaCl in cation-supplemented Mueller-Hinton broth. After 24 h of incubation, the results from both methods correlated well and were within 1 log2 dilution for all isolates tested. Only one-half of all resistant isolates (92 of 183) were detected at 18 h by using the standard disk diffusion technique with 5-micrograms methicillin disks, and even fewer were detected with 10-micrograms methicillin disks and newly recommended zone-size criteria. However, the standard disk diffusion method with 4% NaCl in the agar increased the sensitivity and specificity for identification of the proper phenotype to greater than 92%. The spread plate and new spot techniques, both using agar with 4% NaCl, were also sensitive methods. Of 47 S. epidermidis isolates tested against oxacillin, 6 (13%) were oxacillin susceptible but methicillin resistant. Two automated systems, the Automicrobic system (Vitek Systems) and MicroScan (American MicroScan), as well as two broth screening systems available from Remel and Austin Biological Laboratories, failed to detect several resistant isolates, depending on the species.
