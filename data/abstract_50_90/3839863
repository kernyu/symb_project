The in vitro antibacterial activity of cefminox (CMNX, MT-141) was nearly equal to that of CTX, LMOX, CMZ and CPZ against the 4 species of clinically isolated strains. CMNX was applied to a total of 17 patients including 11 cases of bronchitis, 4 cases of pneumonia and 2 cases of urinary tract infection. The results showed an efficacy rate of 94% (16/17). In the 4 patients from whom the isolation of pathogenic organisms was possible, the bacteriological response to CMNX was appreciable the efficacy rate being 80% (4/5). No side effect of the drug was observed.
