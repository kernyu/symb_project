The antimicrobial susceptibilities of Staphylococcus aureus isolates were concurrently determined by the Sceptor system (BBL Microbiology Systems, Cockeysville, Md.) and by the standard disk diffusion method. For the methicillin-resistant isolates, there was greater than 98% agreement between the two test results with penicillin G, erythromycin, clindamycin, tetracycline, gentamicin, and tobramycin. Major disagreements (susceptible by one method and resistant by the other) were 7% for methicillin, 13.5% for cephalothin, 3.5% for cefamandole, and 27% for amikacin. The major discrepancies for methicillin were eliminated by supplementing the inoculum broth with salt. For methicillin-susceptible isolates, agreement between the two methods was 96 to 100% for all antibiotics except amikacin.
