In 123 cases of external ocular disease in the horse, pathogenic microorganisms isolated with greatest frequency were Streptococcus sp (43.9%), Staphylococcus sp (24.2%), and Pseudomonas sp (13.8%). Fungi were isolated in 4.8% of the cases. In vitro testing showed that most of the Streptococcus sp isolants were sensitive to ampicillin, cephalothin, and carbenicillin. Most of the Staphylococcus sp isolants were sensitive to gentamicin, cephalothin, and bacitracin. Most of the Pseudomonas sp isolants were sensitive to polymyxin B and gentamicin.
