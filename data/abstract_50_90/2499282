Twenty one strains of bifidobacteria belonging to various species were studied with respect to their sensitivity to antibacterial drugs most widely used in medical practice. The strains were isolated from practically healthy persons and from persons in contact with antibiotics in their production. It was found that sensitivity of the strains was the highest with respect to penicillins and tetracyclines. With respect to kanamycin, monomycin and levomycetin the strains were resistant. Strain differences in resistance to separate antibacterial drugs were observed. Increased streptomycin and tetracycline resistance of the strains isolated from the persons being for a prolonged period in contact with these antibiotics in their production, was stated.
