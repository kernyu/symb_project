Minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of miokamycin (M) were evaluated by agar dilution for 1,024 bacterial strains isolated in 6 hospitals and classed as a function of susceptibility and resistance to macrolides, lincosamides, streptogramins group (MLS). MIC of M ranged from 0.25 to 4 micrograms/ml (mode MIC 1-2) on Staphylococcus susceptible to MLS and on MLSB inducible strains; M was inactive on MLSB constitutive strains. MIC of M ranged from 0.016 to 4 micrograms/ml (mode MIC 0.12 to 0.5) for Streptococci and Pneumococci susceptible to erythromycin (E) and from 0.12 to greater than 128 for strains resistant to E. Enterococci susceptible to E were inhibited by 0.5 to 2 micrograms/ml (mode MIC 1) and strains resistant to E by 4 to greater than 128. Haemophilus were inhibited by 2 to 64 micrograms/ml (mode MIC 32), Neisseria by 0.12 to 4 (mode MIC 0.5-1) and B. catarrhalis by 0.12 to 8 (mode MIC 1). L. pneumophila was very susceptible to M: MIC 0.016 to 0.12 (mode MIC 0.06). MIC of M ranged generally from 0.5 to 2 micrograms/ml (mode MIC 1) for C. perfringens and from 0.03 to 2 (mode MIC 1) for B. fragilis. Thus, M was shown to be among macrolide antibiotics of resistance non-inducing type on MLSB inducible resistance strains. Its activity was similar to that of spiramycin slightly superior on Staphylococci, slightly inferior on Streptococci and Enterococci, similar on Pneumococci, very superior on Neisseria, Legionella and anaerobes. M had a good activity on Branhamella and, as others macrolides, was poorly active on Haemophilus.
