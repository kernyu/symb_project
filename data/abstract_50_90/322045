Sensitivity of Haemophilus influenzae to 5 antibiotics has been determined by the agar dilution method. Two strains out of 165 are resistant to ampicillin and 5% to tetracycline. All strains were sensitive to chloramphenicol, cotrimoxazole and cefuroxime. A simple test for rapid detection of beta-lactamase with a chromogenic cephalosporin and sensitivity testing by an agar diffusion method were evaluated for Haemophilus.
