Miconazole nitrate tablets were used in the treatment of candidiasis of the oral cavity and the digestive tract. In 5 out of 6 patients with severe, predisposing factors and who had received previous unsuccessful antimycotic therapy, clinical improvement occurred after a few days of miconazole treatment. Mycological cure of these 5 patients was achieved after 1-11 weeks of treatment. Three of the 5 cured patients relapsed after 3 months, due to basic failure. One patient complained of the drug's unpleasant taste. Otherwise, no side effects were observed. There was no apparent development of any resistance to the drug.
