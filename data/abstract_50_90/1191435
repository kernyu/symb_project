A case of Candida albicans endocarditis is described in which treatment with 5-fluorocytosine was started after aortic valve replacement, but relapse followed discontinuance of treatment. At a second operation the aortic valve was replaced under 5-fluorocytosine cover and treatment was continued with both 5-fluorocytosine and amphotericin-B. No resistance to 5-fluorocytosine developed, and the candida infection was eradicated. The patient is well 22 months after his operation.
