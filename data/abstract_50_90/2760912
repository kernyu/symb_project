The ability of EcoR1 restriction enzyme fragmentation patterns and of immunoblotting to differentiate methicillin-resistant isolates of Staphylococcus aureus were compared. All isolates examined were typable by both methods and the reproducibility of each was excellent. Immunoblotting differentiated eight types and DNA restriction patterns four. The former technique was of value in characterising methicillin-resistant isolates of S. aureus and controlling an outbreak due to them.
