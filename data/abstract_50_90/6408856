The serological typing of 96% of P. aeruginosa strains isolated in hospitals has been carried out by means of agglutinating sera, and the tendency towards the prevalence of the strains of group V (25.3%) and serovar O11 (18.1%) has been revealed. The determination of the antibiotic sensitivity of different variants has shown that the strains of groups I, V and serovar O11 possess pronounced resistance to a wide spectrum of antibiotics, their resistance to gentamycin and polymixin being higher than in the strains of other serotypes. The determination of antibiotic resistance can serve only as an additional test in the serological typing of P. aeruginosa.
