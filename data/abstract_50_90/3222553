The growth, using freshly cultured Escherichia coli with ampicillin or heat-treated lyophilised E coli as a food source, of the larvae of the mouse nematode Nematospiroides dubius and the infectivity of resulting third stage larvae were determined. Concentrations of E coli between 0.5 and 1 mg dry weight ml-1 permitted optimal larval development for both N dubius and Trichostrongylus colubriformis. Development of larvae of susceptible and cambendazole-resistant strains of Haemonchus contortus in thiabendazole solutions showed clear differences between the strains and the larval development test was more sensitive than the egg hatch test. The test also detected a levamisole resistant strain of H contortus, although the degree of resistance could not be adequately measured. It is concluded that the test can be run with any anthelmintic to which resistance is suspected.
