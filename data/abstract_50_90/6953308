The uptake of L-tyrosine into wild type and antibiotic resistant strains of Schizosaccharomyces pombe requires an energy source, is initially linear with respect to time, is inhibited by 2,4-dinitrophenol and sodium azide and is saturable. However the initial uptake rates and the amount of L-tyrosine accummulated by antibiotic resistant strains are much less than wild type. Comparison of the kinetic constants of uptake shows that mutant strains have a reduced maximum velocity of uptake compared to wild type and a larger Km. Since the three mutant strains possess a permeability barrier to L-tyrosine as well as being drug resistant this is an indication that antibiotic resistance may be caused by a decrease in plasma membrane permeability.
