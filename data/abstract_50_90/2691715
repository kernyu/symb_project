From July to October in 1986, hospital data on 717 isolates of causative microorganism from patients with urinary tract infections and background information on 562 patients were collected. The urinary tract infections were divided into 3 groups; simple infections and complicated infections with or without the use of indwelling catheter. We investigated such factors as the patients' sex, age, and drug treatments, and the isolates obtained from the infections. From 1981 to 1986, about 25% of the patients with simple infections were males and about 60 to 70% among those with complicated infections were males each year. During these 6 years, no noticeable changes occurred in sex and age distributions of patients with any type of the infections, but the species of isolates changed remarkably. In 1982 and 1983, the isolation rates of Enterococcus faecalis (Streptococcus spp. or Streptococcus faecalis) obtained from the patients were about 8% in both of male and female patients. In 1984, the rate in females increased to 17.9%. In 1985, the rates in males and females were 14.9% and 7.6%, respectively. Similar rates were also observed in 1986: 16.1 and 7.4%. The isolation rate of Staphylococcus aureus in 1982 was 0.7%, as was in 1983. In however, increased to 1.7% in 1984 and to 3.2% in 1985. It was 2.5% in 1986. The isolation rate of Gram-positive bacteria was 11.1% in 1982; it increased to 18.9% in 1983 and to over 20% between 1984 to 1986. Among Gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of Pseudomonas aeruginosa form patients with complicated urinary tract infections with a catheter was high and over 20% in both 1985 and 1986. When antibacterial agents were administrated for 3 days, changes in number of species of isolates tended to be more pronounced in complicated infections with or without the use of catheter than in simple infections. According to date obtained in 1986, when antibiotic agents were administered for 8 or more days, the changes were definitely more drastic in complicated infections than in simple ones. An upmost care in the selection of antibiotic drugs according to their antibacterial spectra and activities, therefore, appears necessary, and an attention should be paid on future changes in species of bacteria isolated from infections.
