An experiment was carried out for eliminating the multimedicinal resistance markers of E. coli, populating the intestinal tract of calves, in vivo with rimactan introduced per os, and rationed 10 mg/kg of live weight, once during a period of 8 days. The highest percentage and the longest elimination were observed for the neomycin, the novobiocin and the chlornitromycin resistance markers. The elimination was weaker for the erythromycin, the streptomycin and the kanamycin markers and the weakest was for the penicillin and tetracycline markers. There appeared a difference in the elimination of the resistance markers with the different calves, especially for the markers with a low degree of elimination, depending on the individual peculiarities of the calves. Riphamycin proved to be an eliminating means for the resistance markers of E coli in vivo of calves suffering from enteritis. Alongside with the elimination of the resistance markers, due to the treatment of calves with rimactan, an almost complete recovery was achieved. Rimactan is a reliable means for fighting enteric illnesses with calves, caused by enteropathogenic E. coli.
