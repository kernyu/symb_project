The resistance to slow growth of three commercial acrylic bone cements has been evaluated. It was found that small additions of 1 micrometer diameter barium sulphate particles reduced the resistance to slow crack growth of Simplex P and CMW acrylic bone cements, while a small addition of the antibiotic Gentamicin had no detectable effect on cracking in Palacos R bone cdment.
