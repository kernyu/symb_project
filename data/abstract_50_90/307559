Based on a limited number of biochemical properties, a system for biotyping Haemophilus influenzae (M. Kilian, Acta Pathol. Microbiol, Scand. Sect. B82:835-842, 1976) was used to analyze the relationship of biotype to source of infection and antibiotic resistance for 600 clinical strains. The distribution of biotypes from bacteremic patients was significantly different (P less than 0.001) from the distribution of biotypes from nonbacteremic patients. Although there appeared to be a correlation between biotype and source of isolation, no single biotype correlated with a specific clinical syndrome in bacteremic patients. The frequency of resistance to antibiotics (ampicillin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, and kanamycin), which was known to be at least in part plasmid mediated, was determined. Of the 600 isolates, 43 were resistant to at least one antibiotic (30 were ampicillin resistant, 11 were tetracycline resistant, 1 was ampicillin-tetracycline resistant, and 1 was tetracycline-chloramphenicol resistant). Of these 43 resistant isolates, 42 were either biotype I or II. This distribution of biotypes among antibiotic-resustant isolates was significantly different from the overall distribution of biotypes (P is less than 0.001).
