The authors stress the recent increase of tuberculosis, especially in high-risk areas and populations. They illustrate the changes the disease has undergone lately, also with reference to a case they had occasion to observe. They describe 9-month and 6-month treatment schemes as well as the drugs that can be applied in cases of drug resistance which is rather frequent in AIDS patients.
