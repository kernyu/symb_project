The eliminating effect of rimactan was studied in vivo on resistance markers of E. coli, isolated from 18 new-born pigs with a clinic of enteritis. Rimactan is given per os in 15 mg/kg, liver weight, once a day in the course of 6 days. The sensitivity of the strains eliminated was checked in vitro in respect of 16 medicinal preparations (Pe, Sm, Km, Neo, Chl, Novo, Te, Er, Ty, Sp, Le, Am, Ox, Oxte, Ge-penicillin, streptomycin, kanamycin, neomycin, chlornitromycin, novobiocin, tetracycline, erythromycin, tylan, spectam, lentamycin, ampicillin, oxacillin, oxytetracycline, gentamicin and borgal). To 11 of them E. coli were resistant. After a treatment with rimactan an elimination of resistance markers was observed right on the first day, namely, with regard to Sm, Chl, Novo, Te, Er, Sp, Oxte. On the second day was eliminated the Pe-marker, on the third--the Ty-marker, and it was not until on the fifth day that Am and Ox-markers were eliminated. The elimination frequency was the highest between the third and the fifth days. The experiments studied also the sensitivity of the investigated coli strains with regard to different rimactan concentrations (2-256 mg/cm3) in vitro. It was most pronounced for a concentration of 16-32 mg/cm3. It was proved that rimactan can be used as a preparation for eliminating resistance markers (R-factors) of E. coli in pigs suffering from enteritis.
