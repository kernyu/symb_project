Although acute perfusion of guinea pig hearts with ethanol does not affect cardiac protein synthesis, the latter is inhibited after prolonged ingestion of ethanol when tested in an in vitro system with the working right ventricle. This study reports on the added stress of ischemia on such hearts. Hearts were removed from maturing guinea pigs after 13-16 weeks of ingesting 10% ethanol and were perfused in vitro under conditions of relative ischemia (one-sixth of normal coronary flow) with maintenance of right ventricular load and outflow resistance identical to normal pre-ischemic levels. With this degree of ischemia, there was a 4-6 fold increase in lactate production, an 80% drop in ATP, and a 90% decrease in creatine phosphate after 150 min of the ischemia. Incorporation of both labeled lysine and phenylalanine into cardiac protein was also diminished to 35% of control in the left ventricle and 55% of control in the right. This diminution of protein synthesis was the same in hearts from ethanol-drinking and matched control animals. Thus, prior prolonged ingestion of ethanol did not worsen the inhibition of protein synthesis by oxygen deprivation. There were, however, two significant differences in hemodynamic response to the ischemia by the right ventricles of hearts from ethanol-drinking guinea pigs compared to their matched controls.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
