Ceftazidime, a new broad-spectrum cephalosporin, was administered to 30 patients with serious bacterial infections in a randomized dosing trial with daily doses of 1.5 or 3 g. Both regimens were equally efficacious, with satisfactory clinical responses in 28 instances (93%) and microbiological eradication of 79% of initial bacterial isolates. The development of resistance to ceftazidime during therapy was observed in three cases (Enterobacter agglomerans, Enterobacter cloacae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and superinfection by a resistant Enterobacter agglomerans strain occurred in one case. Adverse reactions of clinical significance included one case each of leukopenia, azotemia, diarrhea (Clostridium difficile toxin positive), and rash.
