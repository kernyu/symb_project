Minimal concentrations of penicillin, ampicillin, cephalothin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, erythromycin, nitrofurantoin, kanamycin and gentamicin inhibitory to Pasteurella haemolytica biotypes A and T were determined. They were found to be significantly higher for T than for A type strains in the case of all the antimicrobial drugs tested except the two aminoglycosides kanamycin and gentamicin, for which no differences were observed. In the case of penicillin the differences were so marked that they may be useful as a basis for biotyping P haemolytica isolates. The emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains observed in recent years, however, may limit such application.
