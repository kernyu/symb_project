The synergistic interaction between amikacin and several investigational antibiotics against seven different genera of nosocomial pathogens was assessed using the microtitre checkerboard technique. The greatest percentage of tests showing synergy was when amikacin was used in combination with apalcillin and azlocillin particularly against Serratia marcescens and Proteus spp. When amikacin was combined with several new semi-synthetic cephalosporins, synergy was present in a variable percentage of tests. No antagonism was found in any of the tested combinations.
