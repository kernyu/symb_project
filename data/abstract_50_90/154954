Deficient dwarf colony (DDC) mutants of E. coli K 12, harboring or no resistance plasmids, were obtained in vitro. The R plasmids of parental strains and to DDC mutants were transfered by conjugation to normal colony, and to DDC mutants of E. coli K 12; the frequencies of transfer were similar for all strains studied.
