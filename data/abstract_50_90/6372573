Thirty-six slowly growing mycobacteria isolated from the tissues of leprosy patients were studied using 40 characteristics as well as susceptibility to 27 distinct mycobacteriophages. The composition in mycolic acids of selected strains was also studied. According to the data, the strains formed 5 clusters. Some of the clusters were possibly as yet undescribed species; however, comparison of the data with the known properties of Mycobacterium leprae leads to the conclusion that none of the strains were identical to the leprosy bacillus.
