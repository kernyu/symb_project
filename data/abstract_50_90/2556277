Combinations of different beta-lactam antibiotics, including cefotaxime, with three beta-lactamase inhibitors were tested against cephalosporinase producing bacterial strains. The most significant antagonism was obtained with a combination of clavulanic acid and cefotaxime, while almost no antagonism was observed with sulbactam and tazobactam. In strains belonging to five different species there was a correlation between the levels of cephalosporinase produced after exposure to different concentrations of inhibitors and the MICs of cefotaxime combined with the same concentrations of inhibitors. It is concluded that there is little likelihood of antagonism between beta-lactam antibiotics and sulbactam or tazobactam.
