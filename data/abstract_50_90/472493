Sheep infected with benzimidazole resistant strains of Haemonchus contortus and Trichostrongylus colubriformis were used to compare the anthelmintic efficacy of fenbendazole given as a single dose or administered in a divided dose regime over five days. Statistical analysis showed no significant difference between the two methods of administration for H contortus. On the other hand, divided dose fenbendazole was significantly less effective than single doses against adult T colubriformis at dose rates of 5 and 7.5 mg/kg. In the case of H contortus a highly significant correlation coefficient between post treatment egg counts and worm counts (r = 0.789) was obtained. This suggests that reduction in faecal egg output following drug treatment would provide a useful field indication of anthelmintic performance of fenbendazole (and possibly related compounds) against benzimidazole resistant strains of this parasite.
