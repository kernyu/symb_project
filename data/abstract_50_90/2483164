Previous studies suggest that structures within 1 mm of the ventral surface of the medulla (VMS) are involved in the regulation of airway resistance. Furthermore, neurons containing tachykinin peptides have been observed near the surface of the VMS. In the present work, we examined the effects of mammalian tachykinins, substance P (SP) and neurokinin A (NKA), applied locally to the intermediate area of the VMS of cats on tracheal tone and phrenic nerve activity. Since neutral endopeptidase (enkephalinase) has been shown to degrade tachykinin peptides in other tissues, we also investigated the effect of the neutral endopeptidase (NEP) inhibitors (thiorphan and phosphoramidon) on airway tone and phrenic nerve responses to tachykinins when the animals were ventilated with 100% O2 and during hyperoxic hypercapnia and isocapnic hypoxia. Experiments were performed in chloralose-anesthetized cats hyperventilated to phrenic neural apnea or so that the end tidal CO2 was just above the apneic threshold. Trachealis smooth muscle tension was assessed by measuring changes in pressure in a balloon placed in a bypassed segment of trachea (Ptseg). Application to the VMS of SP (10(-5)-10(-3) M) significantly increased tracheal muscle tension. Similar effects were found with applications of NKA. In addition, thiorphan and phosphoramidon potentiated the effects of tachykinins and the responses to hypercapnia and hypoxia of tracheal tone and phrenic nerve activity. Pretreatment with atropine (1 mg/kg) blocked tracheal but not phrenic responses to tachykinins. These suggest that (1) tachykinins acting on structures located on the VMS can increase cholinergic outflow to the airways and augment respiratory motor output, and (2) NEP may be one important modulator of tachykinin-induced effects.
