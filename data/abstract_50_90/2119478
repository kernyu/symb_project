Nuclear run-on experiments were used to verify the hypothesis that extinction of expression of Ig synthesis in L cell x myeloma hybrids occurs at the transcriptional level. Both the H chain enhancer and promoter have been shown to be the targets for extinction in myeloma x T cell hybrids. To examine the expression of genes containing the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene (IgH) enhancer in stably transfected non-B cells, we used a vector with two selectable markers, one of which (gpt providing resistance to mycophenolic acid) either lacks an enhancer or contains the IgH enhancer, the other (neo providing resistance to G418) contains an SV40 enhancer. Stable transfectants of both myeloma (J558L) and L cells selected using G418 were tested to determine if they are also mycophenolic acid resistant. When the IgH enhancer is positioned 3' to the gpt gene, transfected J558L are mycophenolic acid resistant whereas stably transfected L-cells are mycophenolic acid sensitive. However, when large numbers of L cell transfectants are exposed to mycophenolic acid for a prolonged period, resistant subclones emerge. When the 700-bp IgH enhancer fragment was used, the majority of the subclones examined had amplified the vector, between 3 and 38 copies; when a 400-bp subfragment was used no change in the integrated genes was seen. In both cases, in the mycophenolic acid resistant subclones, increased accumulation of gpt and neo mRNA is seen. However, the gpt specific transcripts are heterogeneous in size whereas the neo transcripts are of a discrete size. The heterogeneity of the gpt transcripts results at least in part from heterogeneous initiation. When HXM-resistant L cell subclones are fused to the gamm 2b, k myeloma 4T001, extinction of Ig production occurs; therefore these cells are still capable of negatively regulating Ig expression. These results are discussed from the standpoint of both cis and trans regulatory elements and factors in non-lymphoid cells.
