Fecal samples were collected from 200 feeder-calves on farms in Tennessee, after assembly at a Tennessee auction market, and after transport to a Texas feedyard. A final fecal sample was collected from each calf after 30 days of feedyard confinement. The fecal samples were cultured for the presence of Salmonella spp. Salmonella isolates were serotyped and antimicrobial drug-resistance patterns determined. The number of calves fecal culture-positive for Salmonella spp increased from 0 on the Tennessee farms and auction market to 3/200 (1.5%) at entry into the Texas feedyard, and 16/200 (8%) after 30 days of feedyard confinement. Salmonella serotypes isolated and the number of isolates of each serotype were S reading (8), S cerro (4), S newbrunswick (3), S anatum (2), and S typhimurium (copenhagen; 2). All Salmonella isolates were resistant to 5 or more of 13 antimicrobial drugs tested. Salmonella reading isolates were resistant to 10 or 11 of 13 antimicrobial drugs. The results indicated that the calves could have been infected with Salmonella spp prior to or during the course of the study, and that marketing stress as they moved from farm through feedyard may have induced fecal excretion of salmonellae. In addition, the pattern of antimicrobial drug resistance in the Salmonella isolates was broad.
