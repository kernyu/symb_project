A bacteriocin from serotype c Streptococcus mutans strain C3603 was examined for its inhibitory effect on experimental dental caries in rats infected with S. mutans MT8148R (serotype c). Significant reduction in the incidence of dental caries was found only when bacteriocin was incorporated both in the drinking water and in the diet at a high concentration. However, caries reduction was not as great as expected and the addition of bacteriocin to drinking water alone had no effect on the recovery of S. mutans, plaque deposition or caries incidence. The bacteriocin activity must have been reduced in the oral cavity of rats, and the reasons were examined. Bacteriocin-resistant mutants were not detected and the bacteriocin was not inactivated by saliva. Whereas the bacteriocin did not kill the S. mutans cells grown in a sucrose-containing medium, it completely killed the cells grown in a sucrose-free medium.
