A total of 50 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, including 41 methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strains, were characterized by one-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of whole-cell proteins. The protein patterns contained 40-50 discrete bands and were highly reproducible. Partial patterns were used as the basis of a computer-assisted numerical analysis. The MRSA strains clustered into four phenons at the 83% similarity level; and further division of phenon 1, at the 86% similarity level, resulted in a total of six clusters. All of the MRSA isolates from an MRSA epidemic in the United Kingdom were found to cluster in phenon 1 together with 9 of the 12 MRSA isolates from eastern Australia and 3 other MRSA isolates from the United Kingdom. The remaining three eastern Australian isolates clustered separately in phenon 2. Phenon 3 appeared to be exclusive to strains that were both susceptible and resistant to methicillin and that reacted with group V phages, and phenon 4 comprised 11 isolates, all of which were other MRSA isolates from the United Kingdom. We conclude that computer-assisted numerical analysis by high-resolution sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of whole-cell proteins provides additional criteria for the study of the epidemiology and the evolution of MRSA.
