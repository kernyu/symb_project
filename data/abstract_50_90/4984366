Spores of Bacillus subtilis var. niger, dried on nonhygroscopic and hygroscopic surfaces, were enclosed in one of four thicknesses of low-density polyethylene film (2, 4, 6, and 20 mils). The surfaces were then placed in a specially designed thermochemical death rate apparatus and exposed to an ethylene oxide concentration of 600 mg/liter (at 54.4 C) and 50% relative humidity. Survival data, including both spore survivor curves and decimal reduction values (expressed as D values at 54.4 C-600 mg of ethylene oxide per liter), demonstrated similar survivor patterns when the B. subtilis var. niger spores were enclosed in low-density polyethylene films 2, 4, and 6 mils thick. A comparison of these patterns with those of spores enclosed in glassine and subjected to identical exposure conditions revealed only slight variations. The use of 20-mil polyethylene film greatly increased the time required to kill B. subtilis var. niger spores under the exposure conditions.
