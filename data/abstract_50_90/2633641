The effect of a single prophylactic dose of 500 mg of doxacycline was studied on infectious morbidity in 50 women, undergone caesarean section. There was a reduction in the number of women with puerperal infection in comparison with a control group of women, who received long regimen of prophylactic antibiotics--ampicillin and gentamicin. The reduction was manifested mostly in women with endometritis and febrile state. It is suggested that this could be due to long-lasting monotonous prophylaxis, causing resistance of the microorganisms.
