More numbers of mutants were isolated when UV-irradiated cells of Azotobacter vinelandii OP were treated with caffeine for a limited period of time after UV-irradiation. This is encouraging, considering the difficulty in isolating Azotobacter mutants. Post-irradiation treatment with acriflavine, however, yielded comparatively lesser number of mutants.
