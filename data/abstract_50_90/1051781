Up to now cephalothin was the only parenteral and cephalexin the only oral cephalosporin for clinical use in the GDR. The paper deals with several newer cephalosporins. Of these cephazolin shows some advantages, especially in antibacterial activity and serum levels. There is no metabolization and a better local tolerability compared with cephalothin. Cephapirin has no and cephacetril only inessential advantages. The antibacterial activity of the also well tolerated cephradin is less than that of cephalothin. Certain favourable pharmacokinetic properties such as high lymph and tissue levels, related to serum levels, slight protein binding, high distribution volume and a better stability against beta-lactamases lead to a superiority over cephalothin and diminish the disadvantages compared with cephazolin. The oral form of cephradin very equals to cephalexin.
