Three isolates, one from each species of Candida krusei, C. parakrusei, and C. tropicalis, obtained from infected patients, were more tolerant of significantly higher concentrations of polyene antibiotics than the corresponding reference wild types. The resistant strains isolated had the same sterols as their wild-type counterparts but in lower concentrations.
