A plasmid was constructed in which a T7 RNA polymerase promoter was placed upstream of a recombinant amphotropic retrovirus genome containing a selectable neomycin resistance gene. To test the infectivity of the RNA produced by T7 RNA polymerase in vitro, the RNA was microinjected into the nuclei of psi 2 packaging cells. Infectious particles conferring G418 resistance were released.
