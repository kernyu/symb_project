The organization of two widely distributed sulfonamide resistance genes has been studied. The type I gene was linked to other resistance genes, like streptomycin resistance in R100 and trimethoprim resistance in R388 and other recently isolated plasmids from Sri Lanka. In R388, the sulfonamide resistance gene was transcribed from a promoter of its own, but in all other studied plasmids the linked genes were transcribed from a common promoter. This was especially established with a clone derived from plasmid R6-5, in which transposon mutagenesis showed that expression of sulfonamide resistance was completely dependent on the linked streptomycin resistance gene. The type II sulfonamide resistance gene was independently transcribed and found on two kinds of small resistance plasmids and also on large plasmids isolated from clinical material.
