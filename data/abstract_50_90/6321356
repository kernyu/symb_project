An open randomised clinical study was performed in three groups of 20 patients each with well-defined complicated urinary tract infections to compare the efficacy and tolerance of cefotaxime (1-2 g b.i.d.), ceftizoxime (2 g b.i.d.) and ceftriaxone (2 g u.i.d.). Treatment was administered intravenously over seven days. 63% of the patients were free of infection three to five days after the treatment. There was no significant difference in the efficacy of the three antibiotics with respect to the elimination rate of the sensitive bacteria. There were differences, however, with respect to the development of resistance and the occurrence of superinfections during therapy. No resistance developed during therapy in the ceftizoxime group. Resistance developed twice in the cefotaxime group and three times in the ceftriaxone group. Superinfections with resistant bacteria occurred significantly more frequently in the cefotaxime group (n = 8) than in the ceftriaxone group (n = 2). Six superinfections were observed in the ceftizoxime group. These differences, which could not be explained by the presence of complicating clinical factors, were considered to be due to the pharmacokinetic properties of the substances.
