A bacteriological and clinical study of ceftizoxime suppositories (CZX-S) let to the following results. The CZX serum concentration 10 minutes after insertion of one 250 mg suppository (i.e. 5.7-15.2 mg CZX per kg body weight) ranged from 1.64 to 6.53 micrograms/ml (average: 4.41 micrograms/ml). In one child the concentration 7 minutes after insertion was 4.13 micrograms/ml. Therapeutic responsiveness was recorded as "effective" in 8 (88.9%) of the 9 children who were broken down into 6 with tonsillitis, 1 with pharyngitis, and 2 with UTI. Bacteriological studies conducted in 5 children have confirmed eradication in 4 children, one of whom showing appearance of another strain. The rate of discharge of the suppository within 10 minutes after insertion was 20.4%. Reddening and erosion of the anus were observed in 1 child.
