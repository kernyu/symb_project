The efficacy of mecillinam when given orally in preventing travellers' diarrhoea has been studied. Preliminary investigations in volunteers showed that single daily doses of up to 200 mg for 3 weeks were well tolerated. A randomised double-blind study was carried out in a group of tourists visiting Egypt and the Far East. The subjects took either mecillinam (200 mg daily) or placebo for 25 days. 19/36 tourists (53%) taking placebo and 5/38 tourists (13%) taking mecillinam developed travellers' diarrhoea during the treatment period (p less than 0.001). In the placebo group enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (LT/ST) were found in 2 cases of diarrhoea and Salmonella in another 2 cases. In the remaining cases of diarrhoea the etiological agent was not found in either of the 2 groups.
