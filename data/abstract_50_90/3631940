Four hundred and forty seven staphylococcal strains isolated from various anatomical areas of the mammary gland skin of healthy women were studied with respect to their sensitivity to benzylpenicillin, methicillin, tetracycline, erythromycin and lincomycin. It was shown that 87.5, 85 and 81.4 per cent of the isolates preserved their high sensitivity to lincomycin, methicillin and erythromycin respectively. Sensitivity to tetracycline and benzylpenicillin was observed in 49.9 and 57.7 per cent of the isolates respectively. No resistant forms were detected among S. intermedius and S. hyicus. The strains of S. aureus were resistant only to tetracycline. 56.52 and 39.61 per cent of the S. epidermidis strains amounting to 46.3 per cent in the species structure of Staphylococcus were resistant to tetracycline and benzylpenicillin respectively. No cultures of S. epidermidis resistant to methicillin were isolated. Among 263 strains resistant to separate antibiotics 42 (16 per cent) were polyresistant.
