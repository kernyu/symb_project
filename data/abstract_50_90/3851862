Clinical studies were performed as follows on aspoxicillin (ASPC), a new semisynthetic penicillin. ASPC was intravenously given to 12 patients in doses of 57.7-129.0 mg/kg on average) t.i.d. or q.i.d. for 4-7 days (5.7 days on average): 9 with pneumonia, 1 with tonsillitis, 1 with purulent lymphadenitis and 1 with urinary tract infection. The overall efficacy rate was 83.3%, i.e. efficacy was excellent in 8 (66.7%), good in 2 (16.7%), fair in 1 (8.3%) and poor in 1 (8.3%). Bacteriological efficacy was excellent, i.e. 6 of the 6 strains disappeared. No clinical side effects were observed during treatment. Laboratory abnormalities were observed in 3 cases, slight elevation of GOT in 1, slight elevations of GOT and GPT in 1 and mild eosinophilia in 1. The above results suggest that ASPC is an useful antibiotic for treating pediatric bacterial infections.
