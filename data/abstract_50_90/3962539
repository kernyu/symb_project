Staphylococcal populations isolated from patients have been found to be heterogeneous with respect to their medicinal resistance and biological properties. Due to the action of the protective factors of the body, a decrease in the number of clones resistant to tetracycline and erythromycin and, after immunobiological procedures (specific immunization, levamisole), also in the number of clones having hemolytic and DNAase activity occurs among staphylococcal populations isolated from the kidneys of infected animals.
