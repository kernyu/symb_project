Transformation of mouse 3T3 cells by SV40 results in a specific membrane modification which renders cells resistant to the killing action of the lipophilic antibiotic Amphotericin B. This alteration is under genetic cellular control and is specific for SV40 transformation since transformation with polyoma or mouse sarcoma viruses does not confer resistance to the antibiotic. Analogous resistance is induced by SV40 transformation of primary human fibroblast cells. The acquired resistance is not due to decreased binding of Amphotericin B and is partially reversed if cells are grown in the presence of cholesterol. The results are interpreted as a specific change of sterol structure of the membrane or the loss of a minor cholesterol fraction responsible for the killing action of the antibiotic.
