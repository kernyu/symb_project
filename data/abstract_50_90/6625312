In a comparative study of the inhibitory and lethal effects of rosaramicin, erythromycin, and clindamycin on strains of Campylobacter fetus subsp jejuni and C intestinalis, C jejuni was more readily killed by rosaramicin and clindamycin than was C intestinalis. Erythromycin exhibited an equally lethal effect against both subspecies. However, it was the least active of the macrolides tested against both C jejuni and C intestinalis.
