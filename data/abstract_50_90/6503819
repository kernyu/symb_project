The Royal Free Hospital in London has experienced the spread of a phage 85 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). An analysis of a sample has demonstrated that the plasmids carried by these strains, and the type and location of their drug-resistance determinants, are similar to those of MRSA strains which have been causing problems in some Australian hospitals.
