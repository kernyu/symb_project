Phenotypic "revertants" of a drug resistant strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae were induced by mutgenesis with manganese. Several of these drug sensitive mutants have been shown to result from mutations in the nuclear genome that cause phenotypic modification (suppression) of the mitochondrially-determined drug resistant genotype. Four mutants carrying a single recessive nuclear gene capable of modifying mitochondrial chloramphenicol resistance are described; these may be assigned to three complementation groups. Chloramphenicol resistant mutants mapping at five separate mitochondrial loci are described. At least two of the nuclear genes cause modification of mitochondrial chloramphenicol resistance determined by mutations at three of these loci, but the other two loci are apparently non-suppressible by these nuclear alleles. This indicates that these modifiers do not act by causing a general decrease in cellular or mitochondrial permeability to the drug. A single dominant nuclear modifier of mitochondrial paromomycin resistance has been identified. It is non-allelic to and does not interact with the genes modifying mitochondrial chloramphenicol resistance.
