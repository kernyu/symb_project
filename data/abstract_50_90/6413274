Intercellular electrical coupling in seminiferous tubules from prepubescent and adult Wistar rats has been studied by using conventional techniques. It is found that cells in the seminiferous epithelium are electrically coupled. Experiments performed using "Sertoli cell-enriched" seminiferous tubules indicate the existence of intercellular ionic communication between Sertoli cells. Junctional conductance is independent of the direction of electrical field and it is affected by A23187 Ca ionophore (5 microM) but not by exposure to the neurotransmitter norepinephrine (1-5 X 10(-5) M). Intracellular resistivity (including junctional resistance) is higher in mature as compared to immature germinal epithelium. These findings suggest that cell metabolites or second messenger molecules could be transferred via the low-resistance pathways between epithelium cells to coordinate cellular activity.
