A cultured cell line with increased resistance to 2-deoxy-D-glucose was obtained from cloned baby hamster kidney fibroblasts, BHK 21/C13, after repeated exposure to high concentrations of 2-deoxyglucose. The increased resistance could not be attributed to a decreased permeability of deoxysugar. The resistant cell line incorporated radioactive 2-deoxy-Dglucose in glycoproteins at a similar rate as parental BHK 21C13 cells. Incorporation of radioactive glucosamine, galactose and to lesser extent mannose into cellular glycoproteins was inhibited by 2-deoxyglucose to similar extents in the resistant cells and parental BHK 21/C13 cells. Changes induct cells were detected by altered to toxic plant lectins and by surface labelling as described for parental cells in the preceding paper. It is suggested that the toxicity of 2-deoxy-D-glucose to normal fibroblasts is not mediated through effects on glycosylation of cellular glycoproteins.
