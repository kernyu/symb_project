Four strains of Legionella pneumophila of different virulence as identified by ability to produce pneumonia and death in guinea-pigs infected by a fine-particle aerosol were examined for factors which may intracellularly influence virulence. Possible bactericidal mechanisms possessed by alveolar phagocytes were examined. A relationship could be established between resistance to H2O2, catalase activity and virulence amongst the strains. Virulent strains resisted the bactericidal activity generated by the xanthine oxidase system; avirulent strains did not. Incorporation of various specific inhibitors of the xanthine oxidase system indicated that the main bactericidal activities were associated with the production of H2O2 and hydroxyl radicals (.OH). All strains of L. pneumophila were susceptible to the bactericidal activity generated by the myeloperoxidase-H2O2-halide system, confirming earlier observations that polymorphonuclear neutrophil leucocytes (PMNLS) are able to kill both virulent and avirulent strains of L. pneumophila.
