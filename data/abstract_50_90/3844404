A rapid method for the detection of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus is described. A bioluminescent technique was used to compare the amounts of extracellular adenosine triphosphate released by methicillin-resistant and methicillin-sensitive strains. When tested by this method 29 Staph. aureus strains of known methicillin susceptibility were correctly identified.
