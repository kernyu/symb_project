Conjugative tetracycline resistance plasmids from 15 Clostridium perfringens isolates from piggeries were analyzed by restriction endonuclease digestion and agarose gel electrophoresis. Seven isolates from one farm were found to carry a 47-kilobase pair (kb) plasmid, pJIR5, which had EcoRI, XbaI, and ClaI profiles that were identical to those of a previously characterized plasmid, pCW3. An isolate from a second farm was found to carry a plasmid, pJIR6, which also was indistinguishable from pCW3. Five additional isolates from a third farm carried a 67-kb plasmid, pJIR2, which had at least 29 kb of DNA in common with pCW3. Finally, two isolates from a fourth farm were found to carry a 50-kb plasmid pJIR4, which appeared to consist of an entire pCW3 molecule with a 3-kb insertion. Comparative restriction maps of pCW3, pJIR2, and pJIR4 that identified the regions of homology among these plasmids were constructed. We suggest that many conjugative tetracycline resistance plasmids in C. perfringens may contain a pCW3-like core.
