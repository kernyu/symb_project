The incidence and spectrum of resistance to gentamicin and tobramycin among gram-negative bacilli (GNB) isolated in a community hospital over a one-year period were studied. The overall incidence of resistance was 3.7%. Pseudomonads constituted almost half of the resistant organisms. The majority of resistant GNB was isolated from the respiratory and urinary tracts. Acquisition of resistance was correlated with both the total use of gentamicin in the hospital and recent treatment of individual patients with gentamicin plus tobramycin. The overall incidence of resistant isolates (3.7%) and the incidence of resistance for the enterobacteriaceae (1.9%) were lower than rates reported by comparable studies at several university or municipal hospitals.
