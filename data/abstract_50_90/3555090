Antimicrobial overutilization accelerates the development of bacterial resistance. A prospective, randomized, blinded clinical trial of vaginal hysterectomy prophylaxis was designed to compare the efficacy, safety, and costs of cefazolin with those of cefoxitin and cefotaxime. Sixteen women (7.5%) developed febrile morbidity only, 10 (4.7%) developed major pelvic infection requiring parenteral antimicrobial therapy, and neither clinical nor laboratory adverse reactions of significance were observed. Anemia, diabetes, and additional surgical procedures were associated with a significantly increased incidence of postoperative infection; no regimen was more protective for women with or without these risk factors. Infections almost doubled hospital stay and the charges for health care. Diagnosis-related group reimbursement would have been more than $1,300 less than the mean hospital charge for women who developed infection. Utilizing cefazolin for prophylaxis and reserving cefoxitin and cefotaxime for therapy is cost and antimicrobial efficient.
