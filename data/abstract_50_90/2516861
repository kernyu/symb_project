Mice infected for 45 days with 120 Schistosoma mansoni cercariae and treated with levamisole (25 mg/kg subcutaneously) have more efficient acquired immunity when challenged with 240 Schistosoma mansoni cercariae the same day of treatment (97.7% # 87.7% in infected challenged controls). In praziquantel-treated mice (500 mg/kg for 2 days orally), the reduction in the percent resistance (45.5%) was accompanied by a significant diminution in the size of granuloma, delayed foot pad swelling and granuloma proportionate T-helper cells number. Levamisole when given two weeks post praziquantel treatment and with the challenge infection increased the percent resistance to 79.2%. The increase in percent resistance recorded in mice receiving both praziquantel and levamisole was accompanied by restoration of granuloma size, delayed foot pad swelling and granuloma proportionate T-helper cells number to infected challenged untreated control values. Results reveal-beside efficacy of levamisole as immunoregulant in schistosome immunity--a possible role for the granuloma as a T-cell mediated response in maintenance of immunity.
