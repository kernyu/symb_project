Clinical studies of S-6436 were conducted in 30 urinary tract infection patients in urology with the following conclusion. The patients received the drug twice a day after breakfast and dinner. 1. Of the 30 patiens, excellent efficacy was observed in 9 patients, good efficacy in 14, fair in 5 and poor in 2. The effectiveness (excellent or good) was 76.7%. 2. Twenty-seven (27) strains were isolated from the 30 patients and 23 strains (85.2%) of the 27 disappeared with the administration of the drug. 3. Side effects were found in 3 patients (10%) of the 30. The incidence was almost similar to that of regular cephalexin. No remarkable changes in laboratory data were observed. 4. S-6436 which requires the administration of only twice a day is a preparation which is more convenient for patients than regular cephalexin which requires the administration of four times a day.
