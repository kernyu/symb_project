Stability of aminoglycoside resistance has been investigated in 20 strains of Staphylococcus aureus resistant to gentamicin (16 strains were also resistant to methicillin). In view of previous reports that incubation at elevated temperatures can hasten the loss of unstable antibiotic resistance, we passaged strains daily in a liquid medium for 24 days at 43 degrees C. The nine strains which were resistant to neomycin kept their aminoglycoside resistance virtually intact, whereas most of the other 11 strains (sensitive to neomycin) lost almost all their resistance to gentamicin and kanamycin after 5 days. It thus appears that the stability of aminoglycoside resistances in Staph. aureus is closely linked to the resistance of the strains to neomycin. This finding has important possible consequences in terms of the advisability of the clinical usage of preparations containing neomycin or framycetin for topical application and bowel sterilization.
