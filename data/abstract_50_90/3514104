A study was performed using the Abbott MS-2 system, in which positive urine screening specimens were set up directly to an antimicrobial susceptibility test. These results were compared with standard techniques. The overall correlation for urines containing single pathogens was 95.4%. Results were available 5-8 hr after receipt by the laboratory.
