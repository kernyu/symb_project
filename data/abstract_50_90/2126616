Restriction of cattle movements, vector control, treatment and immunization are identified as the main control methods against East Coast fever (ECF). The effectiveness of these methods is very much influenced by cultural practices, economic and political pressures and development of resistance by ticks to acaricides. The proposed strategies for the future include continued restriction of cattle movements, less intensive vector control in enzootic areas so as to maintain enzootic stability, chemotherapy and immunization of the improved cattle. In addition, research efforts to evaluate strategic vector control, develop cheaper drugs, improve the quality and delivery of the stabilate vaccine, and identify and mass produce appropriate immunogenic subunit vaccines should be intensified.
