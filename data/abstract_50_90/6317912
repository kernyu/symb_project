To evaluate the antibacterial potency of cefotiam (CTM) clinical and laboratory studies were carried out and the results were as follows. Clinical evaluation and adverse reaction CTM was given to total of 23 patients, 10 with bronchopneumonia, 10 with bronchitis and one each with cystitis, enteritis and suspected sepsis. Overall efficacy rate was 78.3% (18/23) (excellent 9, good 9, fair 3, poor 2). Only 1 case showed a side effect of slightly elevated GOT and GPT. Antibacterial activities MIC of CTM against isolates from sputum was investigated on those patients mentioned above and was compared with MIC of CEZ and CMZ. CTM showed superior antibacterial activity against almost all strains. Especially on Haemophilus and Klebsiella antibacterial activity of CTM was impressive. Organisms in sputum Four out of 8 causative bacteria disappeared and 1 out of 8 decreased after administration of CTM. Thus CTM is considered to be the useful drug for the treatment of respiratory infection.
