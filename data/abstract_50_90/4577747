A morphological mutant of Escherichia coli K-12 that grows as round cells at 30, 37, or 42 C in a variety of complex and synthetic media has been isolated and characterized. The gene concerned, designated rodA, has been shown to be on the chromosome between the purE and pyrC loci and to be located at about minute 15. The rodA gene has been found to be co-transducible with the lip gene at a frequency of 95%. The rodA mutant showed an increased resistance to ultraviolet irradiation and a changed sensitivity to drugs. The resistance to ultraviolet irradiation and mitomycin C appears to be co-transducible with the rodA gene.
