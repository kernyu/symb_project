Spontaneously-occurring rifampicin-resistant mutants of Staphylococcus aureus were isolated on 4% (w/v) Tryptone Soya Agar containing 4 and 40 times the m.i.c. for rifampicin. A number of colonies were selected at each rifampicin concentration and were grown aerobically in 3% (w/v) Tryptone Soya Broth for 24 h at 37 degrees C. In the case of S. aureus RN4220 all the mutants grew to bacterial densities up to approximately 1.7 times more than the parent organism. The corresponding levels of extracellular protein secretion varied over a 5-fold range, all the mutants being less productive than the parent. By contrast, mutants of the wild-type Wood 46 strain achieved bacterial densities of only 45-83% that of the parent whilst exoprotein secretion showed a smaller 1.7-fold variation. However, widely-differing patterns of exoproteins were revealed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the parent and mutant organisms of both strains.
