The data on the study of the antibiotic response to 42 Proteus strains isolated from different sources in the hospitals of Kharkov are presented. The isolates belonged to P. mirabilis and P. vulgaris. Many strains were resistant to gentamicin, ampicillin and carbenicillin irrespective of the isolation source. 58.0 and 90.3 per cent of the strains isolated from patients with intestinal infections, 66.6 and 100 per cent of the strains isolated from patients with otitis, 33.3 and 66.6 per cent of the strains isolated from patients with bronchopulmonary affections and 100 and 100 per cent of the strains isolated from patients with urological diseases were resistant to gentamicin and carbenicillin, respectively. As for ampicillin, the respective figures were 74.2, 66.6, 66.6 and 100 per cent. All the strains of P. vulgaris isolated from patients with otitis, urological diseases and bronchopulmonary affections were resistant to ampicillin. The MIC of carbenicillin for all the strains except 4 indole-positive strains of P. vulgaris isolated from the faeces and bronchial excreta was much higher than the borderline values.
