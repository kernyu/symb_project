A survey of methicillin-resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus received for phage typing indicated a marked increase of resistant strains received in 1982 and 1983. Of 62 hospitals in New York City which sent strains for phage typing, 35 had methicillin-resistant isolates. A significant development was the presence of strains of the same phage type at several hospitals, indicating a possible inter-hospital spread of these strains. Among strains present at several hospitals, the largest group was of experimental phage type 88. Strains of type 88 were received from 23 hospitals, representing 56% of all methicillin-resistant strains received from New York City hospitals. Strains of type 88 were resistant to all antistaphylococcal antibiotics, with the exception of vancomycin, and represented a major source of nosocomial infections at 13 hospitals. As experimental phage 88 is not routinely used for typing in U.S. laboratories, the nationwide distribution of strains of type 88 is difficult to assess.
