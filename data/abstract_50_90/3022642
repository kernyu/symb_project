Five herpes simplex virus mutants known or presumed to contain mutations in their DNA polymerase genes conferring resistance to acyclovir and arabinosyladenine also proved to exhibit some degree of resistance to (R)-9-(3,4-dihydroxybutyl)guanine (buciclovir). For one mutant, a buciclovir resistance mutation was mapped to a region of the viral DNA polymerase gene proposed to encode the deoxynucleoside 5'-triphosphate binding domain. These data implicate the viral polymerase as a target of buciclovir action that contributes to its antiviral selectivity.
