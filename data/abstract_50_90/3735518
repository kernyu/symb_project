We present 6 patients in whom prosthetic failure occurred because of sepsis owing to Staphylococcus epidermidis. Such failure occurs in grafts in other areas and is caused by the high resistance of the organism to conventional antibacterial measures. Therapy with appropriate antibiotics, that is aminoglycosides, vancomycin and rifampin, and the need for an early operation are stressed.
