Multiresistant Klebsiella pneumoniae strains isolated from three patients in the same intensive care unit were more resistant to ceftazidime than to cefotaxime and aztreonam but remained susceptible to moxalactam and imipenem. Resistance to beta-lactams, kanamycin, streptomycin, sulfonamides, and tetracyclines was transferable to Escherichia coli by conjugation and was lost en bloc after treatment with ethidium bromide. Agarose gel electrophoresis of wild types and transconjugants indicated that these resistances were mediated by a 150-kilobase plasmid, pCFF14. The strains constitutively produced a beta-lactamase with isoelectric point close to 5.6 and which had a higher Vmax for ceftazidime and cephalothin than for cefotaxime. The substrate profile and isoelectric point of this enzyme thus differ from those of other known plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases, including the broad-spectrum enzyme CTX-1. Hybridization studies support the derivation of the novel enzyme from a TEM-type beta-lactamase.
