We will report the result obtained from sensitivity tests on various anti-cancer agents for malignant bone and soft-tissue tumors based on SDI (Succinic Dehydrogenase Inhibition Test) method with the use of enzymic activities as marker since 1976. Our study comprised 27 cases altogether 15 cases of osteosarcoma, one case each of Ewing's sarcoma, malignant fibrous histiocytoma and malignant lymphoma, 3 cases of metastatic bone tumor and one case each of angiosarcoma, fibrosarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, liposarcoma, 2 cases of metastatic lung tumor among soft-tissue sarcomas. In all cases, sensitivity tests were done on the tumor tissues according to SDI method at the same time as biopsy for the determination of the appropriate medications. Four to six weeks of pre-operative intra-arterial infusion was done followed by radical operation. The results obtained are as follows. Observing the long-term results between subjects that applied anti-cancer agents decided by sensitivity test and those without sensitivity test. The 5 years cumulative survival rate jumped from 30.5% to 50.5%, showing a clear improvement.
