This paper describes the susceptibility of various samples of Boophilus microplus from the southern region of Minas Gerais State in Brazil to the 4 commonest organophosphorus acaricides employed in the area. All samples showed some degree of resistance to each of the compounds used. The resistance factor varied from 1.42 to 132.90, being less in the case of dicrotophos fenthion than with chlorpyrifos and coumaphos.
