Partial revertant has been isolated, with resistance to aminopterin intermediate between wild type and mutant. This phenotype is the result of a mutation at a gene unlinked to the amiA locus. This suppressor mutation (su+) has no phenotypic characteristics by itself except a slow growth. 9 amiA mutants (belonging to 6 sites) are affected by su+ out of the 30 investigated mutants (i.e. 22 sites). The efficiency of suppression is site dependent. Two sites out of 14 mutants belonging to the thymidylate synthetase gene are suppressible. Thymidylate synthetase activity is partially restored by su+. Optochin mutants can also be suppressed. Thus su+ is not gene specific but site specific. Moreover when the str-41 allele conferring resistance to streptomycin is introduced by transformation, the suppression effect is restricted. All these properties are characteristic of an informational suppressor. The t-RNA extracted from the suppressor strain su+ but not the wild type restored the synthesis of coat protein coded by RNA from an amber mutant of bacteriophage f2. Attempts to detect ochre suppression activity gave negative results. It is suggested that the su+ gene is amber specific. Thus su+ can provide insight into the nature of suppressible mutations which should be point mutations. Both low efficiency and high efficiency mutants are affected by su+; this is additional evidence that both categories contain point mutations.
