Plasmid pBR322 and its numerous derivatives are used extensively for research and in biotechnology. The tetracycline-resistance (TcR) genes in these plasmids are expressed constitutively and cells carrying these plasmids are resistant to tetracycline. We have shown that expression of the TcR gene has an adverse effect on the reproductive fitness of plasmid-containing bacteria in both glucose-limited batch and chemostat cultures. If the TcR genes are inactivated at any one of three different restriction sites, mixed cultures of plasmid-free and plasmid-containing bacteria grow at the same rate.
