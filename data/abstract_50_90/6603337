The in vitro activity of rosoxacin was compared to that of ampicillin, cefoxitin, chloramphenicol, and rifampin, against 94 clinical isolates of Haemophilus influenzae. The results indicated that rosoxacin had significantly better in vitro activity against H. influenzae than the other antibiotics evaluated in this study. In addition, rosoxacin was an effective antimicrobial agent against isolates of H. influenzae that were resistant to ampicillin due to beta-lactamase production.
