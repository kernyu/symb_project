In a Swedish nursery 11 of 15 children harboured non-encapsulated Haemophilus influenzae in their nasopharynx. Six children had ampicillin-resistant and beta-lactamase-producing isolates. Five of these children had otitis whereas one was healthy. In order to identify the origin of the H. influenzae isolates their O-antigen determinants were studied by an immunodiffusion technique. 18 different rabbit antisera were used. For each isolate an O-antigen pattern was recorded. Five of the 6 resistant isolates had the same O-antigen pattern, indicating that their origin was one strain. The 6th isolate was from another strain. Different isolates from the same strain were found to be either sensitive or resistant to ampicillin. In one child the H. influenzae lost its resistance during trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole treatment. It is concluded that an R-factor may have been involved in the distribution of ampicillin resistance in the H. influenzae studied. Previous in-vitro studies have shown that beta-lactamase production can be transmitted by a plasmid among H. influenzae strains.
