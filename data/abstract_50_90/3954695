Treatment of ewes with broad-spectrum anthelmintic in August (pre-lambing) and early November, and of lambs in early November and early February, was effective in controlling infections with Trichostrongylus spp in lambs reared on contaminated pastures under set-stocked conditions. It was ineffective in controlling infections with Haemonchus contortus; 82% of lambs had to be withdrawn from the experiment because of severe haemonchosis. Treatment with closantel (7.5 mg/kg) at the same times was very effective against H. contortus but ineffective against Trichostrongylus spp; 25% of lambs had to be withdrawn because of severe trichostrongylosis. The same schedule using broad spectrum anthelmintic and closantel administered concurrently was effective against both parasites; no lambs had to be withdrawn and the bodyweight gain of lambs was higher than in lambs treated with broad-spectrum anthelmintic or closantel alone. The results provide a basis on which to develop a preventive anthelmintic treatment program to control haemonchosis and trichostrongylosis in sheep which will allow the current high frequency of treatment with broad-spectrum anthelmintics to be reduced. Such a program may retard selection for anthelmintic resistance in Trichostrongylus spp.
