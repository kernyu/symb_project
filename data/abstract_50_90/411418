A temperature-sensitive mutant, strain SS, which is assumed to be devoid of beta-lactamase activity and deficient in a permeability barrier to antibiotics, was isolated from a beta-lactamase-less mutant, strain L-2, derived from Pseudomonas aeruginosa IFO 3080. By comparing the beta-lactam antibiotic susceptibility between strains IFO 3080, L-2, and SS, the involvement of both beta-lactamase and a permeability barrier in determining the beta-lactam antibiotic resistance was estimated.
