Genetic relations between mitochondrial mucidin-resistant locus muc3 and ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase-deficient box loci have been studied by recombination and petite deletion analysis. It was found that the locus muc3 maps in the segment of mitochondrial DNA corresponding to the locus box2. The results suggest the participation of box2/muc3 locus in the sequences of the structural gene for cytochrome b.
