To screen for cells with different sensitivities to interferon (IFN), NIH 3T3 mouse fibroblasts were subcloned and examined for their response to IFN treatment. Of 30 clones tested, 2 appeared to be relatively resistant to IFN, since the replication of both vesicular stomatitis virus and mengovirus was not inhibited, even in the presence of 1,000 U of IFN per ml. One resistant (A10) and one sensitive (A5) clone were further analyzed. In both clones, murine leukemia virus replication was equally inhibited by IFN, indicating the presence of functional receptors for IFN in the resistant clone. Using the (2'-5')oligoadenylate (2-5A) radiobinding assay, we could demonstrate that both clones contained the RNase L protein. Furthermore, this enzyme appears to be active, since a similar reduction in the rate of protein synthesis was evident after the introduction of exogenous 2-5A to the cells. We also analyzed the activity of another enzyme in the 2-5A pathway, namely, 2-5A synthetase. In the sensitive cells (A5), the induction of enzyme activity was proportional to the IFN concentration used, reaching a maximum of more than a 10-fold increase over the background of untreated cells. However, little if any induction over the basal activity was observed in the resistant cells (A10) when similar doses of IFN were used. It is thus probable that the lack of induction of 2-5A synthetase activity by IFN in A10 cells is at least partly responsible for their relative resistance to IFN treatment.
