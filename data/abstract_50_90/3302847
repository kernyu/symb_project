The minimal inhibiting concentrations (MIC) of 5 aminosids have been determined by the microdilution method in liquid medium of 4,582 bacterial strains isolated from various pathological samples: 1,039 Staphylococcus, 2,629 Enterobacteria, 759 Pseudomonas and 155 Acinetobacter. The phenotype of resistance has been defined for each strain by listing the antibiotics for which a resistance was observed. The frequencies of the bacterial resistances varied according to the aminosid (gentamicin, sisomicin, tobramycin, netilmicin and amikacin) and to the species studied. For the bacterial species studied, these frequencies of resistance to the aminosid family of antibiotic were weaker in the military hospitals in the district of Paris, than in different civil hospitals where similar studies were conducted.
