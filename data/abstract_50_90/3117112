Two 5'-modified (2'-5')(A)4 oligomers with an increased resistance to phosphatase degradation were synthesized and evaluated for their ability to develop an antiviral response when introduced into intact cells by microinjection or by chemical conjugation to poly(L-lysine). The enzymatic synthesis of 5'-gamma-phosphorothioate and beta,gamma-difluoromethylene (2'-5')(A)4 from adenosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) and adenosine beta,gamma-difluoromethylenetriphosphate by (2'-5')-oligoadenylate synthetase is described. The isolation and characterization of these (2'-5')(A)4 analogues were achieved by high-performance liquid chromatography. The structures of 5'-modified tetramers were corroborated by enzyme digestion. These two 5'-modified tetramers compete as efficiently as natural (2'-5')(A)4 for the binding of a radiolabeled (2'-5')(A)4 probe to ribonuclease (RNase) L. Nevertheless, at the opposite to 5'-gamma-phosphorothioate (2'-5')(A)4, beta,gamma-difluoromethylene (2'-5')(A)4 failed to induce an antiviral response after microinjection in HeLa cells. In addition, it behaves as an antagonist of RNase L as demonstrated by its ability to inhibit the antiviral properties of 5'-gamma-phosphorothioate (2'-5')(A)4 when both are microinjected in HeLa cells. The increased metabolic stability of 5'-gamma-phosphorothioate (2'-5')(A)4 as compared to that of (2'-5')(A)4 was first demonstrated in cell-free extracts and then confirmed in intact cells after introduction in the form of a conjugate to poly(L-lysine). Indeed, 5'-gamma-phosphorothioate (2'-5')(A)4-poly(L-lysine) conjugate induces protein synthesis inhibition and characteristic ribosomal RNA cleavages for longer times than unmodified (2'-5')(A)4-poly(L-lysine) in the same cell system.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
