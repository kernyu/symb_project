Neutrophil granulocytes (PMN) are main defenders against invading microbes. We evaluated the adaptive response of PMN from divers exposed for weeks to high total and oxygen pressures. Under these conditions PMN could be primed to give a heightened respiratory burst upon stimulation with the bacterial peptide analogue, formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (FMLP): blood PMN sampled both shortly after operational saturation dives offshore and during an onshore test-dive gave larger responses than control pre- or post-dive PMN from the same subjects and PMN from laboratory personnel. The assays used measured oxygen consumption, intracellular H2O2 availability, and chemiluminescence. The submaximal responses provoked by the non-metabolizable diacylglycerol analogue phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) were less and less often increased. Such enhanced PMN responsiveness may possibly decrease resistance to skin and other infections that are encountered in divers, if PMN thereby failed to localize correctly to inflamed tissues.
