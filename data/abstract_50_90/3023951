We selected and characterized a series of mouse S49 cell variants that overproduce ornithine decarboxylase (ODC). Previously, we described variants that have an amplified ODC gene and produce about 500-fold more ODC than the wild-type cells of origin (L. McConlogue and P. Coffino, J. Biol. Chem. 258:12083-12086, 1983). We examined a series of independent variants that overproduce ODC to a lesser degree and found that a number of mechanisms other than gene amplification are responsible for the increased ODC activity. Variants were selected for resistance to 0.1 mM difluoromethylornithine, an inhibitor of ODC, by either a single or a multistep process. All showed increased ODC activity and increased ODC mRNA steady-state levels. The half-life of the enzyme was not increased in any of the variants. In one class of variant the increase of ODC mRNA was sufficient to account for ODC overproduction. In a second class, the rate of synthesis of ODC polypeptide per ODC mRNA was at least four- to eightfold higher than that in wild-type cells. Therefore, these variants were altered in the translatability of ODC mRNA. Southern analysis showed that gene amplification does not account for the increased ODC mRNA levels in any of the variants. In both variant and wild-type cells, ODC activity was responsive to changes in polyamine pools; activity was reduced following augmentation of pool size. This change in activity was associated with modification of the rate of synthesis and degradation of ODC but no change in the level of ODC mRNA.
