Six strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis of different virulence in guinea-pigs were compared with regard to their resistance to low pH, to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) at different pH values and to superoxide (O2-). Low virulence was associated with susceptibility to H2O2 in native and isoniazid-resistant strains but not in laboratory-attenuated strain H37Ra. H2O2 resistance was only partly related to catalase content. Low virulence was not associated with susceptibility to an acid environment but the tuberculocidal effect of H2O2 was significantly increased at low pH. The strains were uniformly resistant to O2- and contained similar amounts of superoxide dismutase. The implications of these observations are discussed in the context of mechanisms of host defence in tuberculosis.
