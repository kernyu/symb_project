The penicillinase activities of 169 strains of staphylococci isolated from outpatients were detected by a simple technique that gives the result in 10 minutes on benzylpenicillin and bromocresol purple absorbed Whatman No 1 filter papers. Seventy three out of 100 S. aureus strain and 4 out of 69 S. albus were found to have the enzyme. The ratio of penicillin G resistance among S. aureus and S. albus were found to be 89% and 41% respectively. Six strains (6%) of S. aureus and 5 (7%) S. albus were resistant to both antibiotics. When the findings were compared with those previously reported in Turkey, it was seen that the proportion of the penicillinase + strains and the incidence of resistance in staphylococci to both kinds of penicillins was increased.
