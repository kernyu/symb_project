A high correlation in the susceptibilities of 44 strains isolated from clinical material to a variety of antimicrobial agents was found between the minimum inhibitory concentration and conductivity measurements. Some discrepancy was found for vancomycin and teicoplanin when tested against 21 strains of staphylococci. Similarly, discrepancies were seen with azlocillin, chloramphenicol and gentamicin when tested against strains of aerobic and facultatively anaerobic Gram-negative bacilli. In the majority of cases in which discrepancies were noted, this reflected differences in relative, and not absolute, susceptibility. With five strains of Pseudomonas, however, there was a poor correlation with three of four antibiotics studied. The advantage of this technique is that sensitivities are available within 4-6 h.
