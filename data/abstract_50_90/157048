During the period of hospital treatment a change in the composition of would microflora in 145 patients was found to occur, which affected the characteristics of microflora in respect of species, types and strains. This change consisted in the appearance of new (secondary) species, variants and strains and in the disappearance of some original (primary) ones. The populations of staphylococci were found to vary in the level and spectrum of their resistance to antibiotics (resistovars) and in the degree and spectrum of their sensitivity to staphylococcal typing phages (phagovars). Changes in the populations of staphylococci were caused mainly by the cange of S. aureus or by the additional appearance of their new variants which belonged, as a rule, to phage group II, had multiple resistance to antibiotics and corresponded to the phagovars of the hospital flora. The development of hospital variants in open wounds led to an increased general level of resistance of staphylococcal populations to antibiotics.
