The original observation that in wild-type colicinogenic Escherichia coli strains the introduction of some R factors abolish their colicin production was studied in certain col(+) strains bearing well-defined col factors. Two resistance (R) factors were used and introduced by conjugation in these strains, namely the 222 factor of Watanabe and a Salmonella typhimurium ST factor (coding for resistance to streptomycin and tetracycline only). The introduction of above mentioned R factors abolished the colicin production of col(+) strains most probably by elimination of col factors. All col factors, however, were not equally susceptible to elimination by the R factors tested, since colicin production in ML strains was abolished by infection by the 222 factor but not by the R factor of S. typhimurium ST, which is able to eliminate other col factors.
