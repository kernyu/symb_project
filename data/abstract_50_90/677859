Aerobic gram-negative bacilli isolated from clinical specimens from 1 January to 31 December 1976 were tested for gentamicin and tobramycin resistance by standardized disk testing. For Pseudomonas isolates, gentamicin resistance was 17.1% and tobramycin resistance was 2.8%. For other gram-negative bacilli, gentamicin resistance was 5.5% and tobramycin resistance was 5.4%. Seventy-four patients from whom gentamicin-resistant organisms were isolated from 1 January to 30 June 1976 were studied prospectively. These patients were elderly, had serious underlying diseases, and had received prior antibiotic therapy. Eleven patients carried gentamicin-resistant organisms at the time of transfer to our hospital from community hospitals or nursing homes. Of the 82 isolates from these 74 patients, 52 were from the urine. Pseudomonas was found most frequently (32 isolates), followed by Klebsiella (15 isolates), Enterobacter (10 isolates), Serratia (10 isolates), and Proteus (9 isolates). Only 3 of 32 Pseudomonas isolates caused symptomatic infection, while 16 of 50 other gram-negative bacilli were responsible for symptomatic infection. Although amikacin was the most active drug against gentamicin-resistant gram-negative bacilli and had not been used in our hospital at the time of this study, 25% of Pseudomonas and 18% of all gram-negative bacilli showed resistance to this aminoglycoside.
