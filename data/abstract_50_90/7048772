After description of the most important properties of fosfomycin including pharmacokinetics, antibacterial activity and hitherto got clinical experiences the determinations of the resistance on frequent clinical pathogenic agents are reported. They were performed in the diffusion test in a platelet content of 20 micrograms with admixture of glucose-6-phosphate. High sensitivity rates showed E. coli, P. mirabilis, hemophiliacs and above all Staph. aureus, but also a large part of the Klebsiella and the Pseudomonas strains could be classified as sensitive. Streptococci, pneumococci and enterococci mostly proved as resistant. Thus, in an oral therapy the spectre is smaller than in a highly dosed parenteral supply. Nevertheless, fosfomycin in the two forms of application is to be regarded as an enrichment of the therapeutic possibilities and further should be tested clinically.
