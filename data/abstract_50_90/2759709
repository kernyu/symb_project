A transformation system for the ringworm-producing dermatophyte Trichophyton mentagrophytes has been developed. The system employs the plasmid pHIS, which contains a bacterial hygromycin B phosphotransferase gene linked to Cochliobolus heterostrophus regulatory sequences (B. G. Turgeon, R. C. Garber, and O. C. Yoder, Mol. Cell. Biol. 7:3297-3305, 1987). This plasmid confers hygromycin B resistance to T. mentagrophytes. The DNA was stably integrated into the fungal genome, and the number and sites of integrations varied among transformants. Transformant clones were capable of infecting guinea pigs. This system opens the way for the molecular genetic analysis of the interaction of T. mentagrophytes with epithelial animal tissues.
