The activity of miokamycin, a new macrolide, was investigated against Chlamydia trachomatis, Ureaplasma urealyticum and Mycoplasma hominis, in vitro. Miokamycin was found to be similar in activity to doxycycline and erythromycin against Chlam. trachomatis and U. urealyticum. Against Mycopl. hominis, miokamycin had an activity clearly superior to erythromycin.
