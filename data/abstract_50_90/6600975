Conditioned medium from antigen- or mitogen-stimulated spleen cells, lymphokines, contained factors that induced formation of granulocyte and macrophage colonies in cultures of bone marrow cells (CSF). Lymphokines also contained factors that induced macrophage non-specific tumoricidal activity against fibrosarcoma 1023, antibody-dependent tumoricidal activity against lymphoma 18-8, and antimicrobial activities against amastigotes of the protozoan parasite, Leishmania tropica. The factors that regulated macrophage effector functions, however, were different from those that induced colony formation, and could be distinguished from CSF by Sephadex gel chromatography or heat sensitivity. To further analyze a role for CSF in induction of macrophage effector activities, conditioned medium from several nonlymphoid cell sources (L-929, WEHI-3, and endotoxin-treated lung cells) were assayed for CSF activities and capacity to induce tumoricidal and microbicidal activities. Conditioned medium that contained either macrophages CSF (CSF-1) or the factor that induced formation of both macrophage and granulocyte colonies failed to activate macrophages for effector activities against fibrosarcoma 1023, lymphoma 18-8, and L. tropica amastigotes (either resistance to infection or intracellular destruction). These data suggest that CSF has no direct role in activation of macrophages for tumoricidal and microbicidal activities against these targets.
