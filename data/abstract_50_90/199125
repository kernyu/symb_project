Shift of Pseudomonas fluorescens NCMB 129 from a a phosphate rich into a phosphate limited medium results in a reduction of the membrane phospholipids phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol and cardiolipin. Concomitantly a positively charged ornithine amide lipid is synthesized. The gradual increase of this lipid is paralleled by an increasing resistance to polymyxin B. The binding capacities of intact cells, and isolated inner and outer membranes for the antibiotic are reduced in the resistant organisms. It is discussed that the observed effect could be circumstantial evidence that the positively charged polymyxin B needs negatively charged receptors in biological membranes in order to exert its antibiotic activity.
