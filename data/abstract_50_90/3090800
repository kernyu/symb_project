Among meningococci, nitrite reducing and non-reducing strains occur. From 1319 strains isolated between 1978 and 1984, all serogroup A, D and X isolates reduced nitrite. In strains belonging to the remaining serogroups, nitrite reduction was a variable characteristic. In group B strains isolated in 1978 and 1979 and possibly in group Z' (29 E) strains, sulfadiazine resistance seemed to be coupled to nitrite reduction. Differing from gonococci, N. meningitidis grew well under anaerobic conditions; its growth in the absence of atmospheric oxygen was not stimulated in the presence of nitrite.
