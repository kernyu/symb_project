Peritonitis is the most frequent complication in patients on peritoneal dialysis and bacteria are the major causative agents. Initial antibiotic therapy may be "blind" but the antimicrobial agent used should be related to the infecting organism and its sensitivities. This study was initiated in order to evaluate the microbiological characteristics and sensitivity of bacteria isolated from pre and post peritoneal dialysis effluents. Positive growth of microorganisms was observed in 52 out of 503 cultures. Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis were identified most frequently (29 per cent each). Antibiograms showed high sensitivity to aminoglycosides (netilmicin and amikacin) and to second and third generation cephalosporin. Vancomycin and netilmicin were the best choices for Staphylococcal infection. A high bacterial resistance to ampicillin, co-trimoxazole, cephalothin and gentamicin was verified. Characteristics of organisms causing peritonitis in patients on intermittent peritoneal dialysis is very important, for selection of the initial antibiotic therapy.
