Fenbendazole was administered as an anthelmintic to cattle and sheep by incorporation into feed blocks. The therapeutic dose of 5 mg/kg live mass for sheep and 10 mg/kg for cattle was administered in divided dosages over periods of 4 d and in some cases 5 d. The periods were limited to obviate possible development of resistance. The anthelmintic effect was equal to, or better than, the standard therapeutic dose administered as a single dose in the form of the commercially available fenbendazole suspensions, when comparing the results obtained by the modified non-parametric method of evaluating anthelmintics.
