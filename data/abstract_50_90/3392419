A pneumococcal isolate that caused relapsing meningitis in a patient infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was found to display an unusual response to penicillin--rapid death but a striking lack of cellular lysis. This lytic defect was also detected in all four pneumococcal isolates from three additional HIV-infected patients and in more than half of the clinical isolates from patients with bacteremia. In a rabbit model of meningitis, the lysis-defective strain remained cryptic, with a delay of 5 h in the onset of leukocytosis in cerebrospinal fluid. A marked burst of leukocytosis was associated with ampicillin-induced lysis of a lysis-sensitive strain but not of a lysis-defective strain. Pneumococcal clinical isolates have different lytic responses to penicillin; defective lysis may adversely affect the course of meningitis, an observation suggesting that autolysins play a role in modulating infectious diseases.
