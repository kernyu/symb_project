Experimental data on selection of Streptococcus lactis producing the polypeptide antibiotic nisin with the method of protoplast fusing, one of the modern methods of cell engineering are presented. Four strains of Streptococcus lactis differing in their nisin-producing levels and difficult for protoplasting were used in the study. It was shown possible to transfer them to the protoplast form when respective conditions for their preliminary cultivation and regeneration are provided. Distinctive features of these strains with respect to the antibiotic resistance, sugar fermentation and growth component requirements were revealed. The protoplast fusing yielded hybrids differing from the parent strains by a number of phenotypical features and nisin-synthesizing activity.
