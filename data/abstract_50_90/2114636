The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of rifabutin for M. tuberculosis was 0.006 to 0.06 micrograms/ml, and 0.12 to 0.25 micrograms/l for clofazimine. Accordingly, M. tuberculosis is inhibited by concentrations of these two medications that are far lower than the levels normally found in the serum. In the case of M. avium, the MIC of the new drugs such as rifabutin and clofazimine are, in contrast to the MICs for M. tuberculosis, merely of the order of the achievable serum concentrations. The minimum bactericidal concentrations of these two substances are much higher than the bacteriostatic concentrations, which probably explains the frequent therapeutic failures, while in the case of ciprofloxacin, the prevailing situation is much more favourable. The growth of all M. avium strains is inhibited (= sensitive) when elevated concentrations (double "breakpoint" concentrations) of a triple-drug combination comprising rifampicin, ethambutol and ciprofloxacin, or a combination of ethambutol, rifampicin, ciprofloxacin and prothionamid are tested at "normal breakpoint" concentrations.
