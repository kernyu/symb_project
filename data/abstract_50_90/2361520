Pentatrichomonas sp. from the feces of beagles was cultured axenically, and identified as P. hominis. The culture medium used was slightly modified Diamond's medium supplemented with chicken liver extract and rifampicin. Based upon good proliferation after inoculating only a few organisms in this medium, a fecal examination method employing cultivation was developed. Resistance of the trichomonad against disinfectants and metronidazole was tested, and it was found that the protozoan was rather susceptible. After oral administration of the organism to mice and rats, all the treated animals were infected. Since two types of the trichomonad, moving and non-moving, were detected, the presence of any type resistant to standing or drying was ruled out. A possible route of trichomonad infection to beagles is discussed.
