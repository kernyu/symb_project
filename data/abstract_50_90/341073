The literature concerning Serratia marcescens in bovine mastitis is reviewed, and a case of acute mastitis at the Department of Obstetrics, The Veterinary College of Norway, in which Serratia marcescens was isolated in pure culture, is described. Serratia marcescens usually causes only moderately severe symptoms of mastitis, but relapses are common and cases tend to become chronic in nature. The bacterium produces an endotoxin, and this toxin has caused acute mastitis on experimental inoculation into pathogen free udders.
