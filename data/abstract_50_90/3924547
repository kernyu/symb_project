A single dose of 300 mg of the quinoline carbonic acid derivative rosoxazin (Winuron) was used for treatment of 59 men with uncomplicated gonorrhoea and two males with fresh infection with penicillin-resistant gonococci. Within 48 hours full clinical remission was seen in all 61 cases confirmed bacteriologically for gonococci. Concomitant infection with other pathogens transmitted by intercourse, present in 69% of cases, could not be influenced or changed by this treatment. Tolerance was good: 21 patients (32%) complained of slight side effects, however, only 3 patients (5%) showed significant central nervous or gastrointestinal symptoms. Rosoxazin has the great advantage of reliable effectiveness even in case of penicillin-resistant gonococci. Thus, the substance offers an effective and well-tolerated orally applicable and reasonably priced alternative to conventional treatment of gonorrhoea.
