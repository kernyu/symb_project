The addition of cycloheximide to a thermosensitive conditional yeast mutant (ts-187) before and after transfer to the nonpermissive temperature (36 degrees C) for initiation of protein synthesis produces the uncoupling of the RNA and protein synthetic machineries. Since the drug can produce this relaxation in the presence and absence of protein synthesis, it is concluded that the coupling of protein and RNA synthesis, which a temperature shift produces, is not exclusively related to the inhibition of protein synthesis. Support for this assumption has been obtained using the parental (A364A) strain. Transferring this strain to 36 degrees C produces inhibition of RNA synthesis in the presence of stimulation of protein synthesis. Furthermore, cycloheximide and edeine prevent this inhibtion of RNA synthesis that temperature shift produces. It is, therefore, postulated that this inhibition of RNA synthesis results from the synthesis or activation of a factor(s) elicited by the increase in temperature whose function is to repress the transcriptional apparatus. Cycloheximide or edeine can prevent the function of this repressor-like factor by binding to the factor or by preventing its synthesis. The fact that inhibition of protein synthesis either by cycloheximide action or temperature shift in ts-187 produces inhibition of RNA synthesis in isolated nuclei indicates that, in addition to the aforementioned repressor, other factor(s) having a promoter function may exist. Since a slight inhibition of protein synthesis produces nuclear template restrictions, it is postulated that the promoter-like factor(s) is a polypeptide different from the RNA polymerase and, at least in yeast, has a high turnover.
