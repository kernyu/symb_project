The first isolate of a methicillin-resistant strain of Staphylococcus aureus at the Wellington Hospital was made on 31 March 1976, from a man who had emigrated from the United Kingdom in 1973. The infection was successfully treated with co-trimoxazole and fucidin. The epidemiological implications of this infection are discussed.
