With the Le Bras's isotopic semi-microtest method, the authors have studied 139 strains of Plasmodium falciparum isolated in a village near Tananarive in the Highlands of Madagascar. Conditional malariometric rates show the increase of the recrudescence of Malaria in the area which was recently considered as "surveillance area". 5.8% of the 139 studied strains show an in vitro resistance higher than 120 nmoles/l, but whose the level is ever lower than in Africa. 4.3% exhibit a level between 90 and 120 nmoles/l. These values give better prospect for the Isle because the resistance strain rates have remain nearly stable since 1982. The resistance level is always low.
