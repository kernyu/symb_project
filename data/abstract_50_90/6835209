Four two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis systems were used to identify 78 Chinese hamster cell ribosomal proteins by the uniform nomenclature based on rat liver ribosomal proteins. The 40S ribosomal subunit protein affected by Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell one-step emetine resistance mutations is designated S14 in the standard nomenclature. To seek unambiguous genetic evidence for a cause and effect relationship between CHO cell emetine resistance and mutations in the S14 gene, we mutagenized a one-step CHO cell mutant and isolated second-step mutant clones resistant to 10-fold-higher concentrations of emetine. All of the highly resistant, two-step CHO cell mutants obtained displayed additional alterations in ribosomal protein S14. Hybridization complementation tests revealed that the two-step CHO cell emetine resistance mutants were members of the same complementation group defined by one-step CHO cell mutants, EmtB. Two-step mutants obtained from a Chinese hamster lung cell emetine-resistant clone belong to the EmtA complementation group. The two-step and EmtB mutants elaborated 40S ribosomal subunits, which dissociated to 32S and 40S core particles in buffers containing 0.5 M KCl at 4 degrees C. In contrast, 40S ribosomal subunits purified from all EmtA, one-step EmtB EmtC mutants, and wild-type CHO and lung cells were stable at this temperature in buffers containing substantially higher concentrations of salt. Thus, two-step emtB mutations affect the structure of S14 protein directly and the stability of the 40S ribosomal subunit indirectly.
