The new aminoglycoside antibiotic, amikacin (formerly called BB-K8), was used to treat 12 episodes of urinary tract infection caused by hospital-acquired Proteus rettgeri strains. These bacteria were resistant in vitro to kanamycin and gentamicin, and infection persisted in most of the patients in spite of therapy with one of these agents. In all cases, the urinary tract infection was controlled or eradicated by therapy, although relapse or reinfection was frequently encountered in these patients with complicated urological problems. No toxicities attributable to the drug were encountered in the small group of patients.
