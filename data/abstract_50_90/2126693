The combinations of ciprofloxacin plus ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin plus aztreonam, and ciprofloxacin plus azlocillin were evaluated for the presence of synergy against multiresistant isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The frequency of synergy was dependent on antibiotic susceptibilities. If the organism was resistant to ciprofloxacin, synergy was observed in more than 50% of the isolates; however, if the organism was resistant to the beta-lactam (with the exception of ceftazidime), synergy was generally observed in less than 10% of the isolates. Antagonism was not observed with any of the combinations. These results may be helpful in making clinical decisions in treating P. aeruginosa infections.
