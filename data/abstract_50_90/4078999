Fosfomycin sodium (FOM-Na) was studied both fundamentally and clinically in the field of obstetrics and gynecology with following results. It showed good transference into the uterine tissues when given intravenously. The peak concentrations achieved in the uterine tissues following intravenous administration of 2 g of FOM-Na were 26.56 to 53.48 micrograms/g when given as one shot injection and 20.16 to 39.47 micrograms/g as drip infusion. In the serum of vein and uterine artery, peak concentrations of 163.6 to 143.40 micrograms/ml and 120 to 113.12 micrograms/ml were reached following one shot injection and drip infusion, respectively. In general, FOM-Na concentrations in the uterine tissues showed similar changes as those observed for serum concentrations. Clinically, FOM-Na was used in the treatment of 17 cases of obstetrical and gynecological infections at 2 g per dose twice daily as intravenous drip infusions. In all of these cases, good clinical efficacy was obtained. No side effects were observed.
