Strains of resistant species -- Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus faecalis -- isolated from material of nosocomial infections in the surgical department of a Prague hospital were tested for combined effect with further chemotherapeutics. The same concerned Ps, aeruginosa noted, at present, by a high degree of resistance. In Ps. aeruginosa it was the combination sisomicin-carfecillin that proved a success in 50 p. c. of cases as well as that of sisomicin-doxycyclin. At the same time the authors draw attention to the possibility of antagonistic action of the combination sisomicin-chloramphenicol in a third part of the strains tested. Potentiation of the effect in Staphylococcus aureus strains was observed also in the combination sisomicin-carfecillin in more than one half of the strains tested and in case of sisomicin-doxycyclin in one third of the strains. In Streptococcus faecalis strains sisomicin was combined with amoxycillin, carbenicillin, carfecillin and doxycyclin; synergistic action being observed with all those combinations in more than one half of strains tested. No antagonism was registered in those cases. (Ta.).
