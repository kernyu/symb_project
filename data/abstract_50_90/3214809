Gentamicin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis strains which were isolated from infants with staphylococcal bacteremia were analyzed for the presence of self-transmissible gentamicin-resistance (Gmr) plasmids. Conjugative GMr plasmids of approximately 43.8-63 kilobases (kb) were found in all S. aureus strains. Inter- and intra-species transfer of Gmr plasmids by conjugation was observed from S. aureus to S. aureus and to S. epidermidis recipient strains. However, neither inter- nor intra-species transfer of gentamicin resistance by conjugation was observed with nine out of nine S. epidermidis donor strains which were mated with either S. epidermidis or S. aureus recipient strains. These conjugative Gmr plasmids were unable to comobilize a smaller (15-kb) plasmid present in all but two S. aureus clinical isolates. Many of the conjugative Gmr plasmids also carried genetic determinants for kanamycin, tobramycin, neomycin, and ethidium bromide resistance, and for beta-lactamase synthesis. EcoRI restriction endonuclease digests of the S. aureus Gmr conjugative plasmids revealed three different digestion patterns. Four EcoRI restriction endonuclease digestion fragments of 15, 11.4, 6.3, and 4.6 kb in size were common to all plasmids. These plasmids and conjugative Gmr staphylococcal plasmids from other geographical regions shared restriction digestion fragments of similar molecular weights. DNA hybridization with biotinylated S. aureus plasmid pIZ7814 DNA revealed a high degree of homology among these plasmids. A 50.9-kb plasmid from one of the nonconjugative S. epidermidis clinical isolates showed homology with the probe DNA but lacked a portion of a 6.3-kb fragment which was present in all conjugative plasmids and believed to carry much genetic information for conjugation.
