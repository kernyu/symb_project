Neomycin-resistant mutants of Escherichia coli K12 were selected on a minimal succinate medium containing neomycin. In an in vitro poly(U)-dependent protein synthesizing assay, the ribosomes from the mutant strains showed lower levels of misreading than wild-type ribosomes in the presence of neomycin or other error-promoting aminoglycoside antibiotics or ethanol. The mutation was shown to affect a component of the 30S subunit and to facilitate the dissociation of ribosomes into subunits. It is suggested that an impairment in the subunit interaction may be responsible for the observed restriction of the stimulation of misreading.
