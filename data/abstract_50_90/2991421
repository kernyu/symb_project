The isolation of two multi-resistance transposons, Tn2425 and Tn1831, and their relation to Tn21 and Tn2424, is described. A 1.7 kb segment present in Tn2424 and Tn2425 was identified as an IS element by rec-independent transposition, resulting in a cointegrate structure that carries two direct repeated copies of the IS element. By the isolation of this IS element we demonstrated that transposition is one mechanism leading to sequence variations in Tn21-like structures, especially in the region between the mer operon and the sul gene.
