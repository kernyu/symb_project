Edwardsiella ictaluri isolates collected over the past 7 yr from outbreaks of disease in fish occurring in different geographic areas were screened against 37 antimicrobial agents. Edwardsiella ictaluri were found to be susceptible to most agents active against gram negative bacteria such as aminoglycosides, cephalosporins, the "newer" penicillins, quinolones, tetracyclines, chloramphenicol, nitrofurantoin, and potentiated sulfonamides. Resistance was observed against colistin, sulfonamides, and several agents regarded as effective for gram positive bacteria. There was no evidence of unusual antimicrobial resistance associated with E. ictaluri or of developing resistance.
