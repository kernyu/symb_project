The effect of 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine (ara-C) on DNA replication in methotrexate-resistant Chinese hamster ovary cells was examined under circumstances in which nuclear DNA synthesis could be distinguished from mitochondrial DNA synthesis. G1-arrested cells were induced to traverse G1 and enter the S phase in the presence of radiolabeled thymidine and various concentrations of the drug. ara-C did not affect the kinetics of G1 traverse and subsequent entry into S after release from isoleucine deprivation, as measured by autoradiography. However, the inhibitor reduced the net rate of thymidine incorporation into nuclear DNA in a dose-dependent fashion. Autoradiography of nuclear matrix-DNA halo structures suggests that the drug inhibits nuclear thymidine incorporation by slowing chain elongation and movement of newly replicated DNA through a matrix-bound replication apparatus. Southern blot analysis of restriction digests of DNA radiolabeled in early S in the presence of ara-C indicates that the synthesis of the early-replicating amplified dihydrofolate reductase domain in these cells begins at sequences identical with those observed in cells synchronized with aphidicolin or hydroxyurea. Progressively lower concentrations of ara-C permit proportionately greater extents of the amplified unit to be replicated. These results suggest that ara-C slows the rate of chain elongation without altering the site at which DNA replication is initiated within individual replicons.
