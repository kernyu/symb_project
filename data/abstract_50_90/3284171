Benzimidazole- and levamisole-resistant Ostertagia circumcincta from sheep have been reported from several countries, but there are no reports of anthelmintic-resistant O. ostertagi in cattle, where resistance has been confirmed in controlled trials. The reasons for this may include (1) the biology of the worm, (2) avoidance of drug action by inhibition, (3) host metabolism of drugs, (4) less anthelmintic used in cattle than in sheep, (5) high costs of controlled trials, (6) lack of adequate in vitro tests to detect resistant worms and (7) lack of reporting of anthelmintic failures. Reduced efficacy of the anthelmintics levamisole and thiabendazole to adult O. ostertagi and of modern benzimidazoles to the inhibited L4 larvae has been reported in cattle. This latter effect might, in part, represent a stage-specific expression of resistance. Although anthelmintic resistance in O. ostertagi is not known to be a problem at present, it could potentially become a serious issue.
