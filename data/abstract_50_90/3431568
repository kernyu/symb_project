Among promastigotes of 22 different American Leishmania strains, a 5000-fold variation in sinefungin susceptibility was found, apparently independent of their taxonomic classification, although L. mexicana strains did tend to be more resistant than L. braziliensis. Protein carboxymethyltransferase (EC 2.1.1.24) and glycine N-methyltransferase (EC 2.1.1.20) activities were not substantially different in sinefungin-susceptible and -resistant American Leishmania strains. However, when [methyl-3H]methionine incorporation into total protein or gamma-glutamyl residues of leishmanial proteins was carried out in the presence or absence of sinefungin, protein carboxymethylating activity was significantly inhibited only in sinefungin-susceptible Leishmania strains. Furthermore, when protein carboxymethyltransferase activity was purified from several leishmanial strains to a state of electrophoretic homogeneity (sp. act. = 240 nmol h-1 (mg protein)-1), the enzyme from the resistant cells showed a higher inhibition constant (mean Ki 55 microM against 2 microM in susceptible cells) for sinefungin. This 28-times stronger affinity of the susceptible cell enzyme towards sinefungin despite normal protein carboxymethyltransferase specific activity seems to be a key element of the resistance mechanism of certain American Leishmania strains.
