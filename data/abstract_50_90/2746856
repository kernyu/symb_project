Sulbactam (SBT) is a new derivative of the basic penicillin nucleus. It effectively and irreversibly inhibits several important bacterial beta-lactamases and displays synergistic effects against the resistant organisms when co-administered with ampicillin (ABPC). SBT/ABPC, which is a fixed combination of SBT and ABPC in a 1:2 ratio, was studied for clinical efficacy in the field of pediatrics. Patients treated were infants and children ranging from 12 days to 13 years and 2 months old suffering from acute tonsillitis in 2 cases, acute bronchitis in 2 cases, septicemia in 2 cases, acute enteritis, acute pyelonephritis and osteomyelitis in 1 case each, a total of 9 cases. SBT/ABPC was administered 100-300 mg/kg in daily doses and durations of treatment ranged from 4 to 17 days. Clinical results were "excellent" in 6 and "good" in 2: the efficacy rate was 88.9% or 8 cases out of 9. Neither clinical side effects nor abnormal laboratory findings obviously attributable to SBT/ABPC were observed in any cases.
