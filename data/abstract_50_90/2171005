Centrifugation through a cesium chloride density gradient and agarose gel electrophoresis of the DNA from the purple non-sulfur photosynthetic bacterium Ectothiorhodospira sp. resolved a single extrachromosomal element, plasmid pDG1. Its size was estimated to be 13.2 kilobases by restriction endonuclease mapping. Plasmid pDG1 and two restriction fragments thereof were cloned in Escherichia coli C600 with plasmid pBR327 as a vector to form mixed plasmids pDGBR1, pDGBR2, and pDGBR3. The resistance to streptomycin and mercury found in Ectothiorhodospira sp. was transferred to E. coli C600 after transformation with pDGBR1 but not with pDGBR2 and pDGBR3. The replication origin of pDG1 was estimated to be within a 2-kilobase restriction fragment of pDG1 by monitoring its replication in E. coli HB101, using a kanamycin resistance reporter gene. High stringency molecular hybridization with 32P-labeled pDG1 identified specific fragments of genomic DNA, suggesting the integration of some plasmid sequences. In accordance with the hypothesis that this integration is due to a transposon, we tested the transfer of streptomycin resistance from pDG1 into plasmid pVK100 used as a target. For this test, we regrouped in the same cells of E. coli HB101, pDGBR1 and mobilizable plasmid pVK100 (tetr,kmr). We used the conjugation capacity of the pVK100/pRK2013 system to rescue the target plasmid pVK100 into nalidixic acid-resistant E. coli DH1. The transfer frequency of streptomycin resistance into pVK100 was 10(-5), compatible with a transposition event. In line with the existence of a transposon on pDG1, heteroduplex mapping indicated the presence of inverted repeats approximately 7.5 kb from one another.
