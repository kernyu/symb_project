Human cells deficient in rate of excision repair of DNA damage induced by UV-radiation, i.e., xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) cells, are much more sensitive to the mutagenic effect of UV than are cells from normal persons. The lower frequency of mutants in the latter cells has been attributed to the fact that, unlike XP cells, they excise most of the potentially mutagenic lesions before these can be converted into mutations. If semi-conservative DNA synthesis on a template still containing unexcised lesions is responsible for introducing mutations and if replication of the gene of interest, e.g., hypoxanthine (guanine)phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) for thioguanine resistance or the elongation factor 2 (EF-2) for diphtheria toxin resistance, occurs at a particular time during S-phase, it should be possible to shorten the time available for such repair by synchronizing cells and irradiating them just as the gene is to be replicated. The predicted result would be a much higher frequency of mutants at one part in the S-phase than at other times. To test this, cells were synchronized using the alpha-polymerase inhibitor aphidicolin, which blocks cells at the G1/S border. Autoradiography, cytofluorimetry, and incorporation of tritiated thymidine studies showed that DNA synthesis started immediately after release from aphidicolin and was completed in 8-10 h. Cells irradiated with 6 J/m2 at various times post-release were assayed for survival and mutations. The frequency of thioguanine- or diphtheria toxin-resistant cells in the population was highest in cells irradiated during the first fifth of the S-phase, i.e., 0-1.5 h post-release. It was significantly lower in cells irradiated at later times. In contrast, UV-induced cytotoxicity showed no significant time dependence during S-phase. These data suggest that the HPRT and EF-2 genes are replicated early in S-phase.
