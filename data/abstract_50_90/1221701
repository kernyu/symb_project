A study was made of the resistance to drying the UV-irradiation, the action of furacillin and chloramine displayed by 60 stains of S. aureus differing by origin (hospital and extrahospital), by the source of discharge (the upper respiratory tracts of carriers and the discharge of the purulent-inflammatory foci of surgical patients), relation to the antibiotics (polyresistant and sensitive) and phage-group reference. It was found that the resistance of staphylococci to the unfavourable factors was not always associated with the listed signs of the strains. In respect to drying a marked resistance was expressed by the hospital strains in comparison with the extrahospital ones, polyresistant in comparison with the sensitive ones, staphylococci of III and I+III phage groups in comparison with the strains of other bacteriophage groups. Strains of the III phage group proved to be the most resistant to the UV-irradiation. Strains isolated from carriers were more resistant to furacillin than staphylococci isolated from the purulent-inflammatory foci. Strains of the III phage group and nontyping had analogous advantages over the cultures of other phage groups.
