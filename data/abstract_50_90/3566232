Sensitivity of 201 S. typhi strains to antibiotics and chlorine containing disinfectants was studied. The strains were isolated in the regions of the Left Bank Ukraine. Among the typhoid cultures the proportion of R+ strains was on the whole equal to 29.3 per cent. Chloramine resistant strains amounted to 21.8 per cent. Among chloramine resistant strains the number of the cultures carrying R plasmids was 3 times higher than that of the strains sensitive to disinfectant. Simultaneous transfer of the R plasmid and chloramine resistance to the recipient strain suggested that resistance of the S. typhi strains to chloramine was of plasmid nature.
