One hundred coagulase-negative staphylococci isolated from blood cultures of neonates have been biotyped and phage typed. These results have been compared with previous reports. The susceptibility of the strains to antimicrobial drugs has also been examined and a rise in resistance rates towards the end of the study was documented. The possible causes of this finding are discussed.
