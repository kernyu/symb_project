Twenty-seven isolates of citrate-positive variants of Escherichia coli were obtained from domestic pigeons, pigs, cattle, and horses. With the exception of citrate utilization, all isolates closely resembled typical E. coli in their biochemical reactions. These isolates were multiply resistant to antibiotics in in vitro susceptibility tests. Transfer experiments of multiple-drug resistance to the E. coli K-12 strain showed that all citrate-positive isolates from domestic pigeons, pigs, and cattle, resistant to three or more drugs, carried R plasmids showing temperature-sensitive transfer.
