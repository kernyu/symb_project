In 1984-1986 we examined the insecticide resistance in 33 populations of Musca domestica. The average sensibility amounted to 21% with Trichlorfon, to 66% with Dimethoate and to 63% with Trichlorphenidine. For the moment, Dimethoate is the most successful insecticide in problematic stables, compared with it Trichlorfon often fails. Pest control operators have reported on first cases of inefficacy of Pyrethrum.
