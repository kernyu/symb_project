A number of independent insertions into bacteriophage lambda of the translocatable tetracycline-resistance element Tn10 have been isolated and characterized. The physical positions and relative orientations of several such insertions were determined. Two independent insertions appear to lie in the same orientation at or very near the same site in the cI gene, and two more lie in opposite orientations at or near the same position in or near the rex gene. Insertions in or near genes cI, rex, and cIII have been characterized genetically for their effects on expression of nearby genes. Tn10 appears to exert a polar effect on expression of distal genes when it is inserted within an operon, even when expression of that operon is under the influence of lambda N-function. In addition, Tn10 insertions in rex appear to influence in some way expression of an "upstream" gene, cI. Lambda derivatives carrying Tn10 give rise to spontaneously occurring, tetracycline-sensitive deletions at high frequencies. It is likely that formation of these deletions is promoted in some way by the Tn10 element. Lambda::Tn10 phages carrying a Tn10 element that has undergone several successive cycles of translocation since its first isolation and characterization have been analyzed. The results confirm that Tn10 often retains its physical and functional integrity during many cycles of translocation. Lambda derivatives carrying Tn10 have been used to generate insertions of Tn10 in the chromosome of Escherichia coli. This process is independent of recA function, and seems to be quite analogous to the translocation of Tn10 in Salmonella typhimurium as studied previously.
