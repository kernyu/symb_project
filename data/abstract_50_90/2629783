Several relevant characteristics have been studied in nine Lactobacillus plantarum strains isolated from Cabrales cheese. They fermented lactose efficiently and possessed both beta-galactosidase and beta-phosphogalactosidase activities, but no significant proteolytic activity was detected. Antimicrobial susceptibility tests revealed no high level resistance to any of the fourteen compounds tested. All the strains had a high content of extrachromosomal DNA of unknown function. A recombinant plasmid comprising pUC19 from Escherichia coli and a small cryptic plasmid from L. plantarum has been constructed and may be used to develop a shuttle vector for these species.
