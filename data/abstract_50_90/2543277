The major outer membrane protein was extracted from Campylobacter coli by Triton X-100/EDTA fractionation of cell envelopes. This heat-modifiable protein was shown to have pore-forming activity in black lipid bilayers. The C. coli porin formed a relatively small cation-selective pore with a mean single-channel conductance of 0.53 +/- 0.16 nS in 1.0 M KCl. There was no evidence of oligomer formation, which suggested that each protein monomer formed a pore. Pore-forming activity of the C. coli porin and similarly prepared Campylobacter jejuni porin was also measured in liposome-swelling assays. These results confirmed the cation selectivity of both pores. The C. coli porin formed a small pore, which hindered the penetration of solutes with a molecular weight of 262, and a larger pore, which hindered the penetration of solutes with a molecular weight of 340, in a protein-concentration-dependent manner. C. jejuni formed one size of pore that was slightly larger than the C. coli pore and just permitted the passage of solutes, with a molecular weight of 340. A review of the literature concerning in vitro screening of antimicrobial agents tended to confirm the low permeability of the C. jejuni outer membrane to hydrophilic antimicrobial agents except when the molecules had molecular weights of less than 360. The porins of C. jejuni and C. coli may contribute to intrinsic resistance to antimicrobial agents, whereas alternative (nonporin) routes of antimicrobial agent uptake may be more important determinants of susceptibility to antimicrobial agents.
