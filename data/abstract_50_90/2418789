Testicular cancer is divided pathologically into two categories; seminoma and non-seminomatous germ cell tumor (NSGCT). Seminoma is a radio-sensitive tumor, so that radiation has been mainly used for stages I and II. Stage III seminoma is treated in the same way as NSGCT. Several years ago stages I and II NSGCT were treated primarily by retroperitoneal lymph node dissection. These days, chemotherapy, such as PVB, or VAB-6 therapy, is adopted as the first choice of treatment, followed by surgical intervention to elucidate the remaining bulky mass if present. Stage III NSGCT is also managed by chemotherapy. By these procedures 70-90% CR of patients with NSGCT is obtained. Prostatic cancer has been treated mainly according to its stages. As for stage A cancer palliative therapy has been shown to yield good results. However, in the case of poorly-differentiated tumors, local irradiation with anti-androgenic treatment should be employed. Stage B cancer should be treated by radical surgery. Local lymph node dissection is usually indicated. In addition local irradiation and anti-androgenic therapy should be considered. Most stage C or D patients do well for a while with antiandrogenic therapy. Within two or three years, however, drug resistance ensues, recessitating a change in the therapeutic modality. Treatments of choice include in chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and others. Treatment of penile cancer involves chemotherapy with bleomycin and irradiation, which result in considerable improvement.
