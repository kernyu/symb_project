Nowadays, infection with septicemia still can be a life-threatening disease. We evaluated the therapeutic behavior of clinicians basing on our diagnostic experiences during the last years and data from continuous epidemiological analysis. Important statements resulted on therapy without knowledge of the pathogen. Our results allow us to calculate the probabilities of various kinds of pathogens as well as their resistance patterns, dependent on the ward. One third of our isolates were staphylococci, followed by about 15% E. coli. The portions of all the other pathogens, e.g. other gram-negative rods, streptococci or anaerobs, were 2% or less. The application of various classes of antibiotics has been rather constant in the years 1981-1984, the penicillins showing a slight increase while the cephalosporins decreased. However, our data proved the cephalosporins to be of marked better efficacy. This points out the importance of such evaluations, whose results must be given to the physicians.
