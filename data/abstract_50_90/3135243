Nystatin-resistant strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae with mutations in final steps of ergosterol biosynthesis have been studied in the ecologo-genetic yeast--drosophila system. It has been shown that yeast strains which belong to the Petersghoff genetic yeast stock collection, with mutations in NYSX, NYS2 and NYS3 genes, provide the development of Drosophila melanogaster. In the process of nutrition with yeasts having mutations in the NYS2 gene, the development of drosophila larvae takes place, due to ergosterol accumulated in the yeast cells. Drosophila melanogaster was shown to be unable to utilize the sterols with 8(9) and 24(25) double bonds.
