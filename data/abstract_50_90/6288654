R1162 is an 8.7-kilobase (kb) broad-host-range replicon encoding resistance to streptomycin and sulfa drugs. In vitro deletion of 1.8-kb DNA between coordinates 3.0 and 5.3 kb did not affect plasmid maintenance, but a Tn1 insertion at coordinate 6.3 kb led to a recessive defect in plasmid maintenance. The only cis-acting region necessary for plasmid replication appears to lie between the Tn1 insertion at coordinate 6.3 kb and a second Tn1 insertion at coordinate 6.5 kb. All R1162 sequences between position 6.5 kb and the EcoRI site at coordinate 8.7/0 kb were dispensible for replication in Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas putida. Plasmids carrying insertions in a variety of restriction sites in an R1162::Tn1 derivative were unstable in P. putida but stable in E. coli. Tn5 insertions in R1162 showed a hot spot at coordinate 7.5 kb. A Tn5 insertion at coordinate 8.2 kb appeared to mark the 3' end of the streptomycin phosphotransferase coding sequence. All R1162::Tn5 derivatives showed specific instability in Pseudomonas strains but not in E. coli. The instability could be relieved by internal deletions of Tn5 sequences. In the haloaromatic-degrading Pseudomonas sp. strain B13, introduction of an unstable R1162::Tn5 plasmid led to loss of ability to utilize m-chlorobenzoate as a growth substrate. Our results showed that alteration of plasmid sequence organization in nonessential regions can result in restriction of plasmid host range.
