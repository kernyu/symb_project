Herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 1 from a bone marrow transplant recipient and HSV type 2 from a patient with genital herpes infection were examined for sensitivity to acyclovir after both patients received therapy with the drug. A 38- and 83-fold shift in sensitivity was detected in association with a marked decrease in viral thymidine kinase activity in isolates from both patients. The resistant HSV-1 isolate was approximately 900 times less neurovirulent to Balb/C mice but had similar cutaneous virulence in hairless mice compared with the patient's sensitive strain. In contrast, there was no difference in pathogenicity between the sensitive and resistant HSV-2 isolates. Latency was detected in the trigeminal ganglia of mice after snout inoculation with both the sensitive and resistant HSV-1 isolates. The ganglion isolate from the resistant HSV-inoculated mouse was found to be sensitive to acyclovir, implying a selection for or reversion of the sensitive phenotype. No trigeminal ganglion latency was detected after inoculation with either HSV-2 isolate. Resistance to acyclovir can arise during therapy as a result of diminished viral thymidine kinase activity but does not appear to be associated with increased virulence.
