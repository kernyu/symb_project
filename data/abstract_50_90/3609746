We have constructed a set of plant transformation vectors, promoter cassettes, and chimeric antibiotic-resistance genes for the transformation and expression of foreign genes in plants sensitive to Agrobacterium infection. The different vectors allow for either concurrent or consecutive selection for kanamycin and hygromycin resistance and have a number of unique restriction sites for the insertion of additional DNA. The promoter cassettes utilize the CaMV 19S and CaMV 35S promoters and are constructed to allow for the easy insertion of foreign genes. The cloned gene can then easily be inserted into the transformation vectors. We have utilized the promoter cassettes to express the hygromycin-resistance gene either from the CaMV 35S or the CaMV 19S promoters, with both chimeric resistance genes allowing for the selection of hygromycin-resistant tobacco plants.
