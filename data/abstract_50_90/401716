A revision was done of the sensitivity of isolated germs in urine cultures and various other cultures to fosfomycin from 1972 to the present in the Ciudad Sanitaria 'Francisco Franco' in Barcelona. The results obtained were analyzed. The general observation was that of a fairly uniform behavior in the majority of germs that had shown an increase in resistance in 1973, and a clear tendency to a decrease in resistance in 1974 and 1975 with the exception of P. rettgeri (Lact.+) and P. morganii.
