Sixty-two patients with bronchopneumonia or bronchitis were treated with cefaclor. In 42 patients (= 68%), the therapy was clinically successful. Of the patients who did not respond to therapy, cefaclor-resistant bacteria were found in the sputum culture of seven. Of the remaining 13 patients, ten suffered a secondary infection with cefaclor-resistant bacteria, and in three patients the pathogen found before therapy persisted, although sensitive to cefaclor on testing. In seven patients therapy was clinically successful although cefaclor-resistant pathogens were present before the start of therapy. In the entire group of patients investigated no increase of SGOT, SGPT, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, urea or creatinine was observed. In two patients alkaline phosphatase and SGOT increased slightly; in three patients SGPT increased slightly. On the other hand, in several patients initially elevated SGOT, SGPT and alkaline phosphatase activity decreased during therapy. Clinical side-effects were seen in two patients. In one patient with known penicillin allergy a pruritic exanthema developed; in the other patient, who had dermatitis herpetiformis, exacerbation of skin efflorescences occurred.
