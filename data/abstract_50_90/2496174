Studies were carried out to evaluate the prevalence and risk factors for antibiotic-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae infections. Monthly surveillance of gonococcal isolates showed the prevalence of gonococci with high-level, plasmid-mediated tetracycline resistance (TRNG) to be about 15% for three consecutive 6-mo periods. Over the same period, the prevalence of gonococci with chromosomally mediated resistance to penicillin G steadily increased, from 0% to 9% and then to 21%. From April to July 1987, while chromosomally mediated penicillin resistance was rapidly increasing, a more intensive study was conducted. Patients infected with TRNG reported significantly more lifetime sexual partners (P less than .05) but otherwise resembled patients infected with antibiotic-sensitive gonococci. Patients infected with chromosomally mediated penicillin-resistant gonococci differed from other patients. In addition to reporting more lifetime partners (P less than .05), patients with chromosomally mediated penicillin-resistant gonorrhea were more likely to be older (P less than .05) and more often reported past episodes of gonorrhea (P less than .05), greater numbers of recent sexual partners (P less than .05), new sexual partners (P less than .05), prostitute contact (P = .06), and parenteral drug use or sexual partners who were drug users (P = .07). The introduction of antibiotic-resistant N. gonorrhoeae into communities may be attributable to a subset of patients who practice "risky behaviors" and who could be targeted for disease intervention activities.
