Nosocomial infections in an intensive care nursery (ICN) due to kanamycin-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae during a four-month period with an infection rate of 12% and mortality of 47% are reported. Emergence of this organism was thought to be due to the widespread use of kanamycin. Transmission probably occurred via hands of personnel contaminated during care of colonized or infected infants. Control measures advocated are better handwashing technic and discriminate use of antibiotics. This report emphasizes the need for awareness of this continuous threat and for infection surveillance in an ICN.
