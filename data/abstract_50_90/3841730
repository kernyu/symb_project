Clinical effect in obstetrics and gynecology was studied on aztreonam (AZT), a potent monobactam antibiotic for Gram-negative bacteria. AZT was tested for 7 cases and effective for all of them with quite a high effective rate of 100%. Neither side effect nor abnormal laboratory findings were noted and it sufficiently proves the property of AZT, a totally chemical-synthesized product with lower incidence of allergic reaction. The above results suggest that AZT is useful for obstetrics and gynecologic infections in view of its high stability to beta-lactamase and dehydropeptidase and high potency against Gram-negative bacteria.
