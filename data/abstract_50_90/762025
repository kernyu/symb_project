A cleavage map of a recombinant plasmid carrying Tn10 was constructed for 13 different restriction enzymes. The Tn10 region of this plasmid contains cleavage sites for BamHI, AvaI, BglI, BglII, EcoRI, XbaI, HincII, HindIII, and HpaI. Restriction enzymes PstI, SmaI, KpnI, XhoI, SalI, and PvuI do not cleave within the Tn10 element. This map confirms the previously reported structure of this transposon; it is composed of a unique sequence (approximately6,400 base pairs long), which in part codes for the tetracycline resistance functions and is bounded by inverted repeats (approximately 1,450 base pairs long).
