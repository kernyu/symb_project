One hundred and seventy six cases of various clinical types of pyodermas were investigated to find the causative organism of the disease. Folliculitis formed the largest clinical group followed by infectious eczematoid dermatitis, secondary infection, furuncles, impetigo, ecthyma and carbuncle in descending order of frequency. A total of 189 micro-organisms were isolated from the specimens examined. A single infecting organism was isolated from 74.43% and more than one type of organism from 16.48% of cases. Coagulase positive staphylococcus (73.02%) was the predominant species followed by beta-haemolytic streptococcus (26.98%). Coagulase positive staphylococcus was isolated from 109 (61.93%), beta-haemolytic streptococcus from 22 (12.5%) and both these organisms from 29 (16.48%) cases. The antibiotic resistance pattern showed maximum resistance to penicillin followed by ampicillin. None of the strain was found to be resistant to kanamycin. Low percentage of strains were found to be resistant to streptomycin, oxytetracycline, trimethoprim, cloxacillin, erythromycin, chloramphenicol, cephalexin, gentamycin and neomycin.
