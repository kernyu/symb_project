The process of mefloquine accumulation was studied in mouse erythrocytes infected with either Plasmodium berghei CS (chloroquine susceptible) or P. berghei CR (chloroquine resistant). In both cases, mefloquine was accumulated by a saturable process with an apparent dissociation constant of 2.5 x 10(-6) M and an apparent maximal capacity of 700 mumol per kg of erythrocyte pellet; uninfected mouse erythrocytes accumulated more than half as much mefloquine as infected erythrocytes. The process of accumulation was not stimulated by providing glucose as a substrate, and it was not inhibited in infected erythrocytes by azide, iodoacetate, or incubation at 2 degrees C. Although mefloquine was accumulated more effectively than chloroquine by uninfected erythrocytes and by erythrocytes infected with P. berghei CR, competition between chloroquine and mefloquine was observed, raising the possibility that the same process of accumulation serves both drugs. Chloroquine competitively inhibits mefloquine accumulation, with an apparent inhibitor constant of 1.7 x 10(-3) M, and mefloquine competitively inhibits chloroquine accumulation, with an apparent inhibitor constant of 2 x 10(-6) M. The same process of accumulation and the same group of receptors could serve both drugs if mefloquine has greater access than chloroquine to the receptors. Regardless of whether the same process serves both drugs, undiminished accumulation by erythrocytes infected with P. berghei CR provides an explanation for the superiority of mefloquine in treating chloroquine-resistant malaria.
