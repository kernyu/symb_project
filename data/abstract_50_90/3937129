Counts of aerobic fecal pathogens were done using serial dilutions of stools cultured on selective media with or without amoxicillin + clavulanic acid in 15 hospitalized pediatric patients under oral treatment with the association and in 12 non-hospitalized, non-treated controls. Susceptibility was confirmed by disk antibiotic sensitivity testing. The following microorganisms were studied: Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas, Streptococci D, Staphylococci and Candida. In 8 of the 15 treated patients, Enterobacteriaceae were lacking in one sample or more, but subsequent emergence of resistant Enterobacteriaceae during treatment occurred in 4 of these cases. The 7 other treated patients were immediately colonized by resistant Enterobacteriaceae. No resistant Pseudomonas strains emerged. Streptococci D decreased in some cases. No detectable effect on Staphylococci or Candida was found. Enterobacteriaceae resistant to amoxicillin + clavulanic acid were found in 5 of the 12 controls and in 2 cases accounted for the majority of Enterobacteriaceae.
