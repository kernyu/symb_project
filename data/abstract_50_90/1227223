The sensitivity to antibiotics of the various bacterium strains has been studied in the bile samples of 373 patients with gallbladder and/or biliary duct infection and the clinical effect of antibiotic therapy applied to 325 instances was recorded. The antibiograms suggested an increased resistance mainly of the intestinal bacteria isolated from the bile samples. An increase in the ratio of polyresistant strains was observed. Gentamycin, neomycin, polymixin and kanamycin were the most potent in vitro. Parenterally administered chloramphenicol and oxytetracycline acted favourable in most cases of biliary infection. This therapy was successful even against pathogens resistant in vitro to chloramphenicol and oxytetracycline. The higher efficacy of aimed antibiotic therapy compared to randomly applied treatment is stressed and confirmed by numerical data.
