In the work presented here a simple method is described for sensitivity testing of atypical mycobacteria against antibiotics and sulphamerazin. The sensibility is tested with susceptibility discs in the liquid medium (culture medium 66 without agar) against Amikacin, Ciprofloxacin, Erythromycin, Gentamycin, Lincomycin, Sisomicin and Sulphamerazin. Following strains of atypical mycobacteria were examined: M. kansasii, M. xenopi, M. avium-complex, M. fortuitum. The aminoglycosides, Ciprofloxacin and Erythromycin show a wide spectrum of effects. We state a good sensibility of M. kansasii and M. fortuitum towards lincomycin and of M. kansasii and M. xenopi towards Sulphamerazin. The heterogeneity in sensibility of the single strains of some species already described is confirmed. This fact makes it necessary to carry out a sensitivity test of each strain of atypical mycobacteria before therapy.
