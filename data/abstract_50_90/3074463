The clinical and bacteriological efficacy of norfloxacin and co-trimoxazole was compared in patients with symptomatic upper urinary tract infections (UTI). Norfloxacin 400 mg or cotrimoxazole (160 mg of trimethoprim plus 800 mg of sulphamethoxazole) were given orally b.i.d. for seven days to 94 Thai patients. Clinical and bacteriological assessments were performed before and at 5, 14 and 21 days after start of treatment. Bacteriological outcome could be evaluated in 69 patients, 35 randomized to norfloxacin and 34 to co-trimoxazole. The bacteriological cure rate assessed four to seven days after treatment was significantly higher in the norfloxacin than in the co-trimoxazole group (94.3% vs. 73.5%; p less than 0.05). Few patients in each group reported mild and transient adverse effects. We conclude that norfloxacin was well tolerated and more effective than co-trimoxazole in the treatment of upper UTI.
