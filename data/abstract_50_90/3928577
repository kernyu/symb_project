The in-vitro activity of Sch 34343, a new beta-lactam antimicrobial, was studied in vitro by quantitative broth dilution methods. It was found to have good antibacterial activity against four emerging problem pathogens: methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis isolates showing high level resistance to gentamicin (and other aminoglycosides), Clostridium difficile (the cause of pseudomembranous colitis), and Bacteroides fragilis. On the basis of these promising results, Sch 34343 merits further in-vitro and in-vivo study to define its potential usefulness in treatment of infections with these pathogens in humans.
