One hundred urine isolates Enterobacteriaceae screened for resistance to 30 micrograms nalidixic acid by disc diffusion test were examined by MIC determination for in vitro susceptibility to nalidixic acid, ciprofloxacin, enoxacin, gentamicin, nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim, cephalexin and ceftazidime. Those resistant to nalidixic acid and also gentamicin or a cephalosporin were further examined to determine the mechanism of resistance. Compared to the total urine isolates of Enterobacteriaceae from the same time period, this population as a whole was less susceptible to all antimicrobials tested except gentamicin. Strains that exhibited multiple resistance had the conventional mechanisms of resistance to those antimicrobials. No multiply resistant strains had a permeability barrier due to outer membrane protein alterations causing cross-resistance to chemically unrelated classes of antimicrobials.
