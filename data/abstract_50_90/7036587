Of 70 E. coli isolates from urinary tract infection 44 isolates were groupable with the 164 O antisera. The most predominant O groups were O21, O6, O2, O8, and O15. Twenty four of the isolates had K antigens of which K3 occurring in E. coli O21 was most common. Sixty five of the isolates were resistant to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, streptomycin, septrin and oxytetracycline or a combination thereof. It is suggested that ampicillin, chloramphenicol and oxytetracycline should be used judiciously and on the advice of a medical practitioner to reduce the incidence of drug resistance and R-factor.
