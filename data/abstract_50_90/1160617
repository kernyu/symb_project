The glucose analogue, 2-deoxyglucose (2DG), enhances both the fungistatic and the fungicidal action of amphotericin B in Fungizone (Squibb) against Histoplasma capsulatum yeasts in vitro. This synergistic effect is more pronounced when the test substances are incorporated in double-diffusion agar plates than in liquid medium. Minimum inhibitory concentrations for 2DG and amphotericin B in Fungizone have been established. The effects of components of Fungizone other than amphotericin B as clinically administered were also studied. Neither sodium desoxycholate nor phosphate buffer had any effect on the test organisms when used in recommended clinical concentrations. The 5% glucose infusion solution greatly enhanced the growth of the pathogen and markedly decreased the effectiveness of amphotericin B. H. capsulatum yeasts quickly became resistant to stepwise increases of Fungizone but not of 2DG. Susceptibility to amphotericin B and to 2DG increased with time within certain limits of exposure. The A (albino) phenotype of H. capsulatum is considerably more resistant to amphotericin B than the B (brown) phenotype, but there are no differences in susceptibilities to 2DG. The potential clinical applications of these studies are discussed, since experimental animals and man are reported to tolerate large amounts of 2DG. The incorporation of 2DG in the polyene antibiotic preparation would render it more effective at lower doses and would decrease clinical toxicity.
