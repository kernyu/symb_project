The activity of 5 aminoglycosides compounds (habekacin, amikacin, gentamicin, netilmicin and tobramycin) was studied by an agar dilution method, against 235 strains of Enterobacteriaceae and 146 other Gram negative bacilli. 79 to 98% of susceptible strains were observed, according to the aminoglycoside compound. Habekacin and amikacin were the most effective, specially against the more frequently resistant bacteria: Enterobacter, Serratia, Hafnia, Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In comparison with a previous study, no evolution was observed in the resistance to aminoglycosides.
