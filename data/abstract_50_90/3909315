A novel procedure designed to detect naturally occurring beta-lactam-containing molecules led to isolation of the monobactams - structurally unique, bacterially produced, monocyclic beta-lactam antibiotics. Although none of these monobactams exhibited impressive antimicrobial activity, side-chain variation - as with the penicillins and cephalosporins - resulted in potently active compounds. Aztreonam was chosen from hundreds of compounds for extended laboratory studies. In addition to a unique chemical structure, aztreonam has biologic properties that are unique in comparison with those of the classical penicillins and cephalosporins. Aztreonam is relatively inactive against gram-positive bacteria and anaerobes but is extremely effective against aerobic gram-negative bacteria, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The drug is highly resistant to enzymatic hydrolysis by beta-lactamases, particularly those known to be mediated by R plasmids, and is a poor inducer of chromosomal beta-lactamases. In the majority of drug combinations tested, aztreonam exhibits additive or synergistic activity. In a series of animal-model infections, the drug showed a high degree of efficacy that was consistent with findings in studies in vitro. In a hamster model for Clostridium difficile-induced pseudomembranous colitis, aztreonam did not induce any significant changes.
