Streptothricin resistance determinants have been cloned from the transposons Tn1825 and Tn1826 to the vector plasmid pUC8. The recombinant plasmids were characterized with respect to their physical structure. The resistance properties of their hosts were characterized with respect to the minimal inhibitory concentration of streptothricin and the activity of the streptothricin acetyltransferase. The proteins encoded by the cloned resistance determinants were analysed in a maxicell system. The results of our investigations suggest that the resistance to streptothricin is mediated by the activity of a streptothricin acetyltransferase with both, Tn1825 and Tn1826. However, the resistance determinant of Tn1825 is more complex than Tn1826 and additional functions involved in realizing the resistance phenotype must be recognized.
