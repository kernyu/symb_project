Initial resistance to streptomycin, isoniazid, thiacetazone, rifampicin and ethambutol was tested in 102 patients with bacilliferous tuberculosis in Kalima, a rural area in eastern Zaire. The initial resistance for at least one of these tuberculostatics was 43%. The highest resistance recorded was for streptomycin (31%). No resistance to rifampicin or ethambutol was found. The practical interest of these findings is discussed.
