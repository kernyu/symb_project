The patterns of subtilisin molecular forms of streptomycin-resistant (Strr) and streptomycin-dependent (Strd) mutants of Bacillus subtilis A-50, as well as the revertants of Strd to streptomycin-independence (Str1) were studied. Strr mutants had different quantitative pattern of the same subtilisin molecular forms as compared with the initial strain A-50 (the forms with Rf 0.08, 0.16 and 0.3). In comparison with the initial strain A-50, Strd mutants and Str1 revertants revealed three additional forms of the active enzyme with Rf 0.02, 0.5 and 0.7 and the molecular weights less than 35,000, 28,000 and 20,000 respectively. It was suggested that the rate and character of the enzyme secretion of the degree of its post-translational modifications might result in the different pattern of subtilisin molecular forms produced by these streptomycin mutants.
