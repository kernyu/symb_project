We report the case of a patient who acquired cutaneous leishmaniasis in Israel, with multiple lesions on the face and wrists. The diagnosis was made several months after the onset of disease. We observed large multiple ulcers, which at first responded to sodium stibogluconate (600 mg daily for 2 weeks). After initially decreasing in size, the lesions remained unchanged. Several weeks later clinical exacerbation of the cutaneous leishmaniasis was observed. Fearing late complications on the upper eyelid, we administered two 2-week courses of ketoconazole, 800 mg daily. The early and rapid improvement achieved indicates that ketoconazole was successful in this case of cutaneous leishmaniasis.
