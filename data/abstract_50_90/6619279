A prospective epidemiological survey of a spinal cord injury unit for gentamicin-resistant, gram-negative bacilli was undertaken. The initial survey of the unit suggested a low level of cross-infection involving Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Providencia stuartii. However, a longitudinal study of new admissions revealed that only 13 of 52 nosocomial acquisitions could be considered to be due to cross colonization. Comparison of data on antibiotic use did not suggest selective pressure for resistant endogenous flora. Nosocomial acquisition was directly related to the length of the hospital stay. Antibiotic susceptibility testing of gentamicin-resistant, gram-negative bacilli showed only minor differences between nosocomial isolates and those present during the initial survey. Of the usual antimicrobial agents, amikacin, carbenicillin, and cefoxitin were the most active against all organisms, with the exception of Serratia spp. Of the new beta-lactams, ceftazidime and imipemide (N-formimidoyl thienamycin) were most active.
