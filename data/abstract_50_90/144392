Biological characteristics of 102 Proteus strains isolated from the water bodies is given. The strains studied were referred to Pr. mirabilis, more rarely to Pr. vulgaris; about half of the cultures deviated from these biological types by the signs of indol formation and maltose fermentation. Proteus of groups O3, O5, O13, O23, and O30 were revealed in studying the serological characteristics. All the cultures were polyresistant, nonbacteriocinogenic; most of them were sensitive to the wide colicine spectrum. One strain produced a cytopathogenic action on the tissue culture.
