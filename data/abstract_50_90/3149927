In order to determine the effect of combining ciprofloxacin with beta-lactam and aminoglycoside agents against multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa, ciprofloxacin was tested in vitro with the checkerboard broth microdilution technique with various current beta-lactam and aminoglycoside agents. In both inhibitory and bactericidal testing, the combination of ciprofloxacin with a beta-lactam agent (ceftazidime, piperacillin, mezlocillin, azlocillin, or imipenem) was more likely to show a synergistic effect or additive effect and lack of antagonism (96.5% of all inhibitory and cidal tests) than was a combination of ciprofloxacin with an aminoglycoside [(amikacin, tobramycin, or gentamicin), 90% of all inhibitory and cidal tests]. Finding of antagonism in some testing, especially with aminoglycosides, indicates that results are unpredictable. These results may influence selection of agents for selection in clinical situations.
