The radiometric method is founded on the measurement of the 14CO2 which has gone free. This method was worked out of our team. It is a prompt sensitive and quantitative procedure for the control of antibiotic effect on bacteria. The method is a support in critical clinical situations. The prompt establishment of the antibiotic sensitivity can be live-saving. The empirics descended from 312 surgical patients. The antibiotical sensitivity of secretion samples is to be obtained within 4-6 hours. The results show in comparison with the classic bacteriological examinations five per cent less deviation. At the same time the computer analysis enables a finer distinction. 22 variable findings are possible within the categories: sensible, middling sensible and resistant. In that way the tested antibiotics are classified in an order of rank. The apparatus for the examination is producible without particular expenses. The measurements can be carried out at each hospital or clinical laboratory.
