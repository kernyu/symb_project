The efficacy of ciprofloxacin in the treatment of chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa urinary tract infection was assessed in 16 patients with functional or anatomical abnormalities of the urinary tract. Depending on renal function the dosage varied from 100 mg once daily to 250 mg twice daily. All patients were treated for 14 days. Bacteriological cure was documented for seven patients (44%) during the 8 week follow-up period. In a further seven patients the urine was sterile during treatment but relapse occurred within four weeks of completing the course. Persistence was noted in two cases, one of which was associated with the development of resistance. No significant adverse reactions were recorded. Chronic P. aeruginosa infection of the abnormal urinary tract can be very difficult to eradicate and ciprofloxacin may offer a valuable alternative to potentially more toxic parenteral agents.
