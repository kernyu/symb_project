We conducted a therapeutic trial with cefmenoxime in the field of otorhinolaryngology on a total of 14 subjects including 7 cases of otitis media, 5 cases of peritonsillar abscess, 1 case of chronic sinusitis and 1 case of congenital aural fistula. 1. The effective rate for peritonsillar abscess was extremely high being judged 'markedly effective' in 3 cases and 'effective' in 2 cases. 2. The effective rate for otitis media was also remarkably high; it was judged effective in 85.7% of the cases. It is thought that this is probably due to the fact that therapy and supervision were carried out on inhospital patients. 3. The 1 case of chronic sinusitis and the 1 case of congenital aural fistula were each judged 'effective' and 'markedly effective'. The only side effect observed was a slight case of skin eruption in 1 of the patients.
