The presence of benzimidazole-resistant strains of equine small strongyles was confirmed in horses at two properties in north west England by a series of faecal egg counts and larval cultures after treatment with mebendazole. A trail formulation of mebendazole in combination with piperazine citrate gave greater reductions in faecal egg counts than mebendazole alone but was much less effective than pyrantel embonate or dichlorvos.
