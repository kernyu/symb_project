A cytotoxic effect associated with 9-(1,3-dihydroxy-2-propoxymethyl)-guanine (DHPG) was discovered while searching for spontaneous mutations in a single copy, integrated HSV-1 thymidine kinase (TK) gene in the human 143 TK- cell line. It was found that spontaneous DHPGR mutations could not be selected while other anti-TK drugs resulted in selectable mutation frequencies of 10(-4) to 10(-3). When 143 TK- cells were mixed with these HSV-1 TK+ cells and subjected to DHPG, a 90% to 100% decrease in recoverable TK- colonies was observed. In addition, the media from the HSV-1 TK+ cells metabolizing DHPG was shown to inhibit the growth of the TK- cells.
