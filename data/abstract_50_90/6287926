Clinical efficacy and effect of cefuroxime, claforan and pentrexyl used endolymphatically were studied in 85 patients with acute abscess forming and persisting pneumonia. Previous routine antibiotic therapy in these patients was little effective. Administration of the antibiotics into the peripheral lymph nodes provided blocking of the lymphagenic pathway for the infection due to high levels in the lymphatic system. Endolymphatic use of cefuroxime and claforan resulted in a significant improvement of the functions of the T- and B-immunity systems and the indices of natural resistance. The levels of the autoimmune reactions and sensitization to the bacterial antigens decreased. Endolymphatic use of cefuroxime and claforan once every 3 days provided recovery of 9 2.8 per cent of the patients, the treatment periods being decreased 2.5--3 times. Intravenous administration of the drugs according to the routine schemes, endolymphatic use of pentrexyl (5 g once every 3 days) and endolymphatic administration of cefuroxime in a single dose followed by intravenous therapy was less effective. The efficacy of pentrexyl increased, when it was used endolymphatically in combination with lysozyme. Endolymphatic use of claforan in doses of 2--3 g once every 3 days (3--4 infusions during the treatment course) was most effective.
