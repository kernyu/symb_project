Bacterial strains showing linked resistance to streptomycin (Sm) and sulfonamides (Su) were chosen representing a wide taxonomic and geographical range. Their SmSu resistances were transferred to Escherichia coli K-12 and then plasmid deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) was isolated by ethidium bromide CsCl centrifugation. The plasmid DNA was examined by electron microscopy and analyzed by sedimentation through 5 to 20% neutral sucrose gradients. Plasmid DNA from strains having transmissible SmSu resistance consisted of two or three molecular species, one of which had a molecular mass of about 5.7 Mdal (10(6) daltons), the others varying between 20 to 60 Mdal. By using transformation or F' mobilization, we isolated the SmSu-resistance determinant from any fellow resident plasmids in each strain and again isolated the plasmid DNA. Cosedimentation of each of these with a differently labeled reference plasmid DNA (R300B) showed 9 out of 12 of the plasmids to have a molecular mass not significantly different from the reference (5.7 Mdal); two others were 6.3 and 9.2 Mdal, but PB165 consisted of three plasmids of 7.4, 14.7, and 21.4 Mdal. Three separate isolations of the SmSu determinant from PB165 gave the same three plasmids, which we conclude may be monomer, dimer, and trimer, respectively. DNA-DNA hybridizations at 75 C demonstrated 80 to 93% homology between reference R300B DNA and each isolated SmSu plasmid DNA, except for the 9.2-Mdal plasmid which had 45% homology and PB165 which had 35%. All the SmSu plasmids were present as multiple copies (about 10) per chromosome. The conjugative plasmid of R300 (present as 1.3 copies per chromosome) has been shown to have negligible effect on the number of copies of its accompanying SmSu plasmid R300B. We conclude that the SmSu plasmids are closely related and probably have a common evolutionary origin.
