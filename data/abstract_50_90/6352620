Ceftazidime was administered intravenously in doses of 1 to 6 g/day to 21 patients with serious Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections (12 pulmonary, 6 septicaemias, 3 urinary tract infections). Mean MIC was 1.0 mg/l. Eighteen (86%) of the 21 patients responded satisfactorily (cured or improved). The selection or emergence of resistant organisms during treatment (mostly Candida, Staphylococcus aureus, and enterococci) was noted in 6 patients. Toxicity was minimal (eosinophilia and reversible mild liver function abnormalities).
