Three general strategies for the control of Staphylococcus aureus, particularly methicillin-resistant Staph. aureus (MRSA), are described based on experience in Melbourne, Australia from 1975 to 1984, when such strains have been common. The strategies have been named (1) the Scutari Strategy, based on simple hygienic measures and barrier nursing, (2) the search and destroy technique, with strict isolation of all infected and colonized patients, and attempts to eradicate MRSA from the environment, and (3) the SALT strategy (Staph. aureus limitation techniques) with isolation only for non-containable infections, and 'infectious precautions' for other MRSA infections and for colonized patients.
