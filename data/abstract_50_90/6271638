A 10.8-kb transposable DNA sequence conferring resistance to tetracycline resides on the IncY Escherichia coli plasmid pIP231. This sequence, designated Tn1523, was shown to insert into different sites of the replicons of the IncY prophage P1Cm c1.100 and the IncI1 plasmid pIP112. This process is not dependent on the host recombination system recA. Genetic results indicate that Tn1523 transposition involves the formation of a cointegrate intermediate, either between pIP231 and P1Cm c1.100, or between pIP231 and pIP112. These intermediates were found to be resolved into donor and recipient plasmids, each harboring a copy of the Tn1523 transposon. A stable structure formed by fusion of the pIP231 plasmid with the pIP112 plasmid was also observed. This event occurs in the absence of the bacterial recA gene product and seems to involve a site-specific reciprocal recombination between "IS-like" elements.
