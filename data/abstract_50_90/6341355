The gene for leader peptidase, termed lep, was mapped to the region between purI and nadB at min 54 to 55 on the Escherichia coli chromosome. Mapping involved (i) cloning the gene into the plasmid pBR322, (ii) transforming the plasmid into a polA strain where it cannot replicate autonomously, (iii) selecting by ampicillin resistance the rare cell in which the plasmid had recombined into the chromosome, and (iv) mapping the chromosomal site of drug resistance (and thus plasmid integration) by Hfr matings and P1 transduction. The map position was confirmed by an assay of the enzyme content of cells bearing an F' factor which covered that region of the chromosome.
