In view of a better knowledge of therapeutic failures in operational conditions four groups of patients were analyzed, which included a total of 1511 patients, both new cases and patients re-admitted for tuberculosis of the pulmonary apparatus, that had been treated according to standardized regimens. In three of these groups failures had been recorded at a rate of 3,9% intra-therapeutic failures and 7,6% post-therapeutic ones in the first 18 months after completing the therapy. Out of the four groups a lot was selected, which included 127 cases of therapy failure. This lot was studied under the aspect of causes of the failure and of the possibilities for recovery. The major causes of the failure were non-cooperation of patients (in 48% of the cases), the initial severity of the lesions, associated diseases, the re-admittance, the secondary resistance. Recovery of the intra-therapeutic failures was possible in 46% of the cases, and of patients with post-therapeutic failure in 72% of the cases. On the basis of an analysis of risk factors a series of proposals are made for preventing such failures.
