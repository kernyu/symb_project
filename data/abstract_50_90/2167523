The new macrolide antibiotic, azithromycin, produced significant growth inhibition of Giardia intestinalis at 100 micrograms/ml, but adherence inhibition was significant at concentrations as low as 1 microgram/ml for the two strains used in these experiments. The dyadic combinations of azithromycin-furazolidone, doxycycline-mefloquine, doxycycline-tinidazole and mefloquine-tinidazole were synergistic for inhibition of adherence. These results suggest that these dyadic combinations may be worthy of consideration for chemotherapy of recalcitrant giardiasis.
