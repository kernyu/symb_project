Ampicillin suppository (KS-R1) was given to 67 childish patients with acute febrile upper respiratory infection and 1 patient with urinary tract infection at dose level of 29-63 mg/kg/day divided into 3-4. Twenty-five strains of pathogens were isolated in 23 patients out of 68 before the administration of KS-R1, and 19 strains (76.0%) among them were eradicated by KS-R1. Clinically, all cases were effective. The clinical efficacy alone was determined in other 44 patients with acute febrile upper respiratory infection and 1 patient with urinary tract infection, and only 3 cases among them showed poor effect with KS-R1 treatment. No side effects were observed.
