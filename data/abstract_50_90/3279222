In 33 children with confirmed Plasmodium falciparum malaria, the WHO Extended Field Test was employed to test the sensitivity of the parasite to chloroquine in Zaria urban area. No evidence of resistance to the drug was found. In 82% of the patients parasitaemia had disappeared within 3 days, while the remaining 18% were parasite negative on day 4 or 5. The mean parasite clearance time was calculated as 3.45 +/- 1.23 days. The results suggest that chloroquine sensitivity of P. falciparum may be decreased in this part of Nigeria.
