Deletions in the tet genes derived from Tn10 were formed from different tet::Tn5 insertion mutations by removing DNA sequences located between a HindIII site in Tn5 and a HindIII site adjacent to the tet genes. Tetracycline-sensitive point mutations were mapped in recombination tests with the deletions and were thus aligned with the genetic and physical map of the tet region. Plasmids carrying point mutations were tested for complementation with derivatives of pDU938, a plasmid carrying cloned tet genes derived from Tn10 which had been inactivated by Tn5 insertions. Complementation occurred between promoter-proximal tet point mutations and distal tet::Tn5 insertions, suggesting the existence of two structural genes, tetA and tetB. These results, together with the analysis of polypeptides in minicells harboring pDU938tet::Tn5 mutants, suggested that tetA and tetB are expressed coordinately in an operon. The tetB gene encodes the previously characterized 36,000-dalton cytoplasmic membrane TET protein, but the product of tetA was not identified. Point mutations in either tetA or tetB led to the defective expression of the resistance mechanism involving tetracycline efflux. It is suggested that the tetA and tetB products interact cooperatively in the membrane to express resistance.
