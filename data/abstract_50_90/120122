The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of four betalactamins (carbenicillin, ticarcillin, piperacillin and (CGP-7174-E) against 109 clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was determined by an agar dilution method. CGP-7174-E was the most active (MIC 3.4 micrograms/ml), followed in descending order by piperacillin (MIC 4.9 micrograms/ml), ticarcillin (MIC 22 micrograms/ml) and carbenicillin (MIC 36 microgram/ml). High correlation was found between the MIC of these betalactamins (r greater than 0.60). In 12 strains where MIC for carbenicillin was greater than or equal to 1,024 microgram/ml, MIC for CGP-7174-E was less than or equal to 128 micrograms/ml and less than 16 micrograms/ml in four strains.
