Eighty-five patients with a total of 103 foci of chronic hematogenous osteomyelitis were treated in the period from 1965-1982. Only patients who had been followed for two or more years of treatment were included in the series for evaluation. All foci were treated surgically with thorough debridement. According to the management of the wounds, patients were divided into three groups: wound healing by secondary intention in cases where skin closure was impossible; primary closure of wound with or without pedicle muscle transfer in cases of a small debrided cavity or in cases where a nearby skeletal muscle is available; and closed irrigation and suction drainage of the wound cavity. After a long-term follow-up period, satisfactory results to varying degrees were obtained in each group. Closed intermittent irrigation and suction drainage with high concentrations of antibiotic solutions gave the best results. In instances of failure, the causes may be due to inadequate removal of infected sclerotic bone and sequestra, obstruction of drainage tubes, resistance to antibiotics, or inadequate systemic antibiotic treatment. The use of myocutaneous flap transference to close the postoperative wound of chronic osteomyelitis was introduced, and preliminary results are encouraging.
