An anti-P. aeruginosa, cephalosporin, cefsulodin (CFS) was administered to 2 patients who were affected with inveterate urinary tract infection at ages of 1 year 8 months and 2 years, and another with pneumonia combined with lung fibrosis and bronchiectasia at 3 years. The clinical responses in 3 cases were "good" in 2 and "fair" in 1.
