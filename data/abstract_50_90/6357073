The target enzyme for fosfomycin antibiotic action, enolpyruvyl transferase, was synthesized in similar amounts and with similar kinetic and inhibition constants for phosphoenolpyruvate and fosfomycin, respectively, by an Escherichia coli strain containing the fosfomycin resistance plasmid pOU900 and by plasmid-free strains. Neither phosphoenolpyruvate level nor murein synthesis was altered by pOU900.
