Investigation of interferon inductor (poly IC) in vitro (chick embryon fibroblasts) and in vivo (mice) showed that the main parameters of the preparation effect, i. e. induction of interferon and development of resistance to viruses are as a whole quite comparable. The phenomenon of hyporeactivity in the both systems was reproduced on repeated use of the inductor. At the same time significant differences in the stimulating effect of DEAE-dextran were registered. The merits and demerits of the in vitro system for using in studies on antiviral drugs of the above type are discussed.
