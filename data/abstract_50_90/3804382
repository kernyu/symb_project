In this study we investigated the mechanism of enhanced resistance against Listeria monocytogenes induced with Listeria ribosomal RNA and the adjuvant dimethyldioctadecylammonium bromide (DDA). Mice immunized with DDA alone (which were not protected against Listeria-infection) were used as negative controls. Mice immunized with RNA plus DDA were found to have an increased capacity to mobilize polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) and macrophages to the inflamed peritoneal cavity compared to mice immunized with adjuvant alone. Intraperitoneal (i.p.) inflammation was induced by injection of the sterile irritant proteose peptone. The protective capacity of various cell-populations was investigated by i.p. transfer of cells to normal recipient mice and concomitant challenge of recipient animals with a lethal dose of viable Listeria. Inflammatory PMNs as well as inflammatory macrophages from mice immunized with RNA plus DDA protected recipient animals against listeriosis whereas cells from mice immunized with DDA alone failed to do so. Therefore, enhanced mobilization as well as activation of PMNs and macrophages may have contributed to the expression of protection against L. monocytogenes induced with RNA plus DNA.
