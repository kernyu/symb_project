The minimal inhibitory concentrations of penicillin G, ampicillin, gentamicin, erythromycin and rifampicin were determined for nine strains of Corynebacterium equi. The effect of combinations of any two of these antibiotics on the killing of these strains was determined at antibiotic concentrations achievable in horses using recommended drug dosages (ampicillin 4.0 microgram/ml, gentamicin 1.0 microgram/ml using recommended drug dosages (ampicillin 4.0 microgram/ml, gentamicin 1.0 microgram/ml and erythromycin 0.25 microgram/ml). Penicillin G was used at 4.0 microgram/ml and rifampicin at 0.063 microgram/ml. The combinations of gentamicin with erythromycin or rifampicin gave antagonistic effects on killing compared to either drug alone. Combinations of erythromycin with rifampicin or penicillin showed synergistic effects, as did penicillin--gentamicin. All other combinations, and a triple combination of penicillin--rifampicin--erythromycin, showed additive effects only.
