Methods have been elaborated for detecting the individual changes in the resistance of cells on the basis of the analysis of alcohol- and heat resistance of isolated muscles of Rana temporaria L. A correlation has been determined between the initial resistance level of cells and its change induced by experimental effects. This method allows to identify a really existing relation as opposed to the seeming one caused by random factors. The study of this makes it possible to detect the responses which fail to be found by traditional methods of statistical treatment of experimental material.
