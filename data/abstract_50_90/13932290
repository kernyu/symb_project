Among 652 salmonellae examined, Salmonella typhimurium displayed a much higher incidence of resistance to chlortetracycline than did other serotypes. Among S. typhimurium cultures from man, the incidence of resistance (38%) increased markedly over that of cultures isolated 3 years previously (13.9%), whereas a similar increase was not noted among cultures from fowls. Resistance among cultures from animals other than fowls (72.5%) was due largely to the high incidence of resistance among cultures from bovine sources (93.7%).
