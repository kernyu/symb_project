Pseudomonas aerugionsa phages F 116 and G 101, propagated on ML 4262 strain into which gentamicin-tobramycin resistance determinants have been increased by means of conjugation, from wild-type strains Vy 28, 29 and 34, were capable to transduce R determinants to PAO 1670 strain. Transfer ability was co-transduced as well, with exception of transductants selected with streptomycin. "Autoplaque formation" ability, occurring in original wild-type strain Vy 28, could be co-tranduced with all tobramycin-resistant determinants by F116 but not G 101 phage.
