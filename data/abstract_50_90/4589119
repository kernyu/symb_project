A battery of five tests was used for presumptive identification of the pathogenic streptococci. The non-serological methods included determination of hemolysis for all strains, bacitracin susceptibility for group A streptococci, hippurate hydrolysis by group B streptococci, and bile-esculin reaction for group D streptococci. Enterococcal group D streptococci were differentiated from non-enterococcal group D streptococci by 6.5% NaCl tolerance. Two other categories of streptococci resulted: beta-hemolytic streptococci non-groups A, B, or D; and alpha- or nonhemolytic streptococci, not enterococci, not further identified (viridans streptococci). The tests were used as a battery and not as single entities. In this manner more than 99% of the group A, 99% of the group B, 81% of the beta-hemolytic streptococci non-group A, B, or D, 99% of the group D enterococci, 97% of the group D non-enterococci, and 94% of the viridans streptococci were correctly identified.
