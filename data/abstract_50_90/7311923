Reported is the case of a 32 years old man, who developed a severe condition with recurrent fever episodes, lymphadenopathy, liver and spleen enlargement, and severe headaches 6 weeks after having been bitten by a rat. The headaches even increased during the further course. Psychological tests indicated an increased instability and irritability. The brain scan revealed diffuse cerebral ischemias (on the basis of an increased cerebrovascular resistance). Following the treatment with penicillin, the symptoms cleared almost completely. Although the pathogenic organism could not be identified, the findings and the clinical course of the disease indicate the presence of sodoku with meningoencephalopathic involvement.
