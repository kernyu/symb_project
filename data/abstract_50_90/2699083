Sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine-resistant and chloroquine resistant, but mefloquine sensitive (MIC 5 x 10(-9] isolates of Plasmodium falciparum were used to study the emergence of mefloquine resistance. The continuously cultured isolates which were exposed intermittantly to varying concentrations of mefloquine alone became insensitive to the drug at 1 x 10(-7) M after 12 months, whereas the culture line exposed to the combination of mefloquine, sulfadoxine and pyrimethamine became only slightly insensitive to mefloquine (MIC 2 x 10(-8]. Thus, the efficacy of mefloquine may be prolonged through use in combination with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine.
