This report evaluates the effectiveness of cephalexin in the treatment of bacteriuria in 93 children. Cephalexin therapy eradicated sensitive organisms in 97 per cent of the cases regardless of recurrence, structural abnormality, or status of renal function. Nevertheless, recurrences with a new, resistant organism occurred significantly in certain patients, expecially those with major anatomic abnormalities, during a six-week follow-up period. The incidence of drug reactions was low.
