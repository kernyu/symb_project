The data in the present paper consider, for a longer period, the secondary and the initial drug resistance in pulmonary and extrapulmonary tuberculosis. The paper studies mainly the period of the last 9 years (1979-1987) in comparison with a previous period of 6 years (1973-1978). The 2,194 antibiograms performed for 7 common tuberculostatics show an increase, in the last years, of the general resistance of the germs from 24.3% to 36%. The increase of the resistance is noticed to all the tuberculostatics, but mainly to Rifampicin, from 14.8% to 49.3% and to streptomycin, from 22.7% to 44.8%. An important increase is found, at present, mainly in the drug resistance of germs in the extrapulmonary specimens (lymph nodes 28.5% and CSF 40%) to streptomycin and INH.
