After condinous cultivation in the presence of chloroquine, an African strain of the malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparu, acquired resistance to the drug. The resistance was stable and comparable in vitro to that occurring naturally in a strain from Southeast Asia. This suggests that chloroquine resistance, absent until now in Africa, might arise in the future.
