In this study, 154 cases of suspected bacterial urinary tract infection were examined bacteriologically. Urine cultures yielded, E. coli in 84 patients Citrobacter in 22 (C. freundii: 9, C. diversus: 9) Proteus in 21 (P. vulgaris: 6, P. morgani: 4, P. rettgeri: 2. P. mirabilis: 4, lactose fermenting strains: 5), Pseudomonas in 12 (P. aeruginosa: 5, other strains of Pseudomonas: 7), Klebsiella in 9 (K. aerogenes: 3, K. pneumonia: 6) and Enterobacter in 6 patients (E. aerogenes: 1, E. cloacae: 5). In vitro antibiotic sensitivity tests showed that gentamicin, nalidixic acid, bactrim and gantrisin were the most effective antibacterial agents respectively. Multiple resistances was found in 39 strains of E. coli out of 84. In other species multiple resistance was found in varying degrees. It is concluded that. Every measure should be taken to eradicate the causative organisms in the urinary tract in children.
