Pyridoxine deficiency and 4'-deoxypyridoxine produce acrodynia in rats and seborrheic dermatitis in man. They also produce tumor inhibition in man and animals. Pyridoxine is extensively involved in metabolism and its relationship to the inhibitor 4'-deoxypyridoxine is complex. Pyridoxine deficiency and antagonism increases ground substance viscosity. This increase the inflammatory reactivity of the skin to produce acrodynia in rats and seborrheic dermatitis in man. The increase in ground substance viscosity would explain the increased resistance to tumors in man and animals. Pyridoxine is important in protein metabolism. The protein moiety of glycosaminoglycans in ground substance is small but plays a major role in tissue viscosity. Pyridoxine deficiency or antagonism by itself does not offer a definitive answer for tumors. Combined with substances that stimulate fibroblast or glycosaminoglycans production it may have a significant additive effect.
