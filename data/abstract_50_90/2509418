The antibacterial activity in vitro of meropenem was compared with another carbapenem, imipenem, the penem HRE 664, and ceftazidime. MICs were not influenced by pH nor by inoculum size below 5 X 10(5) cfu/ml: higher inocula caused a modest increase in MIC. Cation supplementation of Mueller-Hinton broth was without effect. Meropenem was more active than imipenem and the other comparative agents against the majority of Gram-negative species (in particular proteus, providencia, morganella, haemophilus, neisseria and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, including isolates from patients with cystic fibrosis). Against Gram-positive organisms, the activity of meropenem was equal to or slightly less that of imipenem. Neither meropenem nor imipenem were influenced by the extended spectrum beta-lactamases that confer resistance to third generation cephalosporins produced by Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca or Serratia marcescens.
