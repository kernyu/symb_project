Mice were irradiated and infused with BALB/c Friend virus-induced FLD-3 erythroleukemia cells. Growth of the cells was estimated by measuring splenic incorporation of 5-iodo-2'-deoxyuridine-125I 5 days after cell transfer. BALB/cJ and C3H mice were 'poor responders' in that FLD-3 cells grew well in their spleens, while mice of other strains were 'good responders', resisting the growth of FLD-3 cells. No H-2 or Fv genetic locus was associated with resistance. Athymic nude mice and mice depleted of marrow tissue by 89Sr or estradiol resisted FLD-3 cells, indicating that the effectors were thymus- and marrow-independent. Silica, carrageenan and Propionibacterium acnes organisms all altered resistance, suggesting a function of macrophages. Neither interferon nor anti-interferon serum treatment altered resistance. Anti-asialo GM1 serum inhibited resistance to FLD-3 cells in vivo and inhibited natural cytotoxic (NC) activity against FLD-3 cells in vitro. NC (FLD-3) activity was greatly decreased in spleens 3 days after irradiation, in contrast with NK (YAC-1) and NC(WEHI-164.1) activities. Moreover, a 3-day delay in infusion of FLD-3 cells 'synergized' with silica in weakening genetic resistance in vivo. Thus, natural immunity to FLD-3 cells in vivo differs from that of genetic resistance to normal bone marrow cell allografts, and the lysis of FLD-3 cells in vitro seems to be mediated by cells which do not easily fit into the definition of natural killer (NK) or natural cytotoxic (NC) cells.
