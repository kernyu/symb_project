Germs in patients suffering from nonspecific odontogenous infections described in a previous paper were analysed with regard to their resistance to chemotherapy (1964 to 1971). At the same time it was discovered that in the bacteria groups: staphyloccocus aureus, streptococci and pneumococci and enterobacteriaceae plus pseudomonas (344 strains) their sensitivity to penicillin, streptomycin, chloramphenicol, oxytetracyclin, erythromycin, polymyxin B and nifurantin varied in several and significant ways. Significant changes were established in the resistance of staphylococcus aureus to all the potentially effective antibiotics, while from 1969 to 1971 the strains with the least resistance appeared. In the 1970 to 1971 period strepto- and pneumococci showed insensitivity to penicillin and streptomycin more frequently than before. From 1969 to 1971 entero-bacteriaceae and pseudomonas also showed evidence of increasing loss of sensitivity to chloramphenicol and oxytetracyclin, whereas the frequency of strains resistant to polymyxin B and nifurantine diminished. The findings are being discussed.
