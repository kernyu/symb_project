Netilmicin was administered to 1 case of simple acute pyelonephritis and 21 cases of complicated urinary tract infections, 22 cases in total, and the effects were evaluated clinically. Total clinical effects of netilmicin evaluated by the UTI standard for evaluation of drug effects showed 61.9% of clinical effectiveness in 21 cases, and the results are satisfactory because 11 cases out of 21 cases were catheterized. The result was examined bacteriologically; the frequency of detection of particular strains among 23 strains clinically isolated from complicated urinary tract infections was that 10 strains of P. aeruginosa (43.5%), 3 of S. marcescens (13.0%), and 3 of E. coli (13.0%), and the ratios of bacteriologically disappeared strains were 70%, 33.3% and 66.7%, respectively, and the overall disappearance ratio was 73.9%. The MIC's determined for 17 strains and disappearance of the bacteria were examined; when MIC was less than 6.25 mcg/ml, 10 strains out of 12 disappeared, that is, 83% of disappearance was obtained. When MIC was larger than 100 mcg/ml, 2 strains out of 5 disappeared, that is, 40% of disappearance was obtained. Disappeared 2 strains of bacteria were isolated from patients who were not catheterized. Neither subjective symptoms nor abnormal laboratory findings related to the drug were observed. It may be said from these findings that netilmicin is an effective drug for urinary tract infections.
