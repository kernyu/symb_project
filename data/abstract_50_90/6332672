The effect of levamisole (LMS) on T-cell-mediated antitumor immunity was examined in adult and aged mice hyperimmune to L1210 leukemia. The immune resistance of aged mice was depressed compared with that of adult mice, which almost completely rejected 5 X 10(7) L1210 cells inoculated IP. A significant level of tumor-specific cytotoxicity was detected in the spleen cells of adult hyperimmune mice by the 51Cr-release assay after in vitro sensitization with mitomycin C-treated L1210 cells. This was mediated by cytotoxic T cells, since in vivo administration of antithymocyte serum or in vitro treatment of the spleen cells with anti-Thy 1.2 antibody and complement abrogated the cytotoxicity completely. In aged mice, however, cytotoxic T-cell activity was lower although the animals were immune to L1210. Administration of LMS (0.38 mg/kg) restored the depressed cytotoxicity of aged mice to the level seen in adult mice. Furthermore, in adult hyperimmune mice LMS augmented T-cell-mediated cytotoxic activity and restored the reduced cytotoxicity caused by in vivo administration of antithymocyte serum. These results indicate that LMS was effective in augmenting T-cell-mediated tumor immunity in immunologically competent or deficient hosts.
