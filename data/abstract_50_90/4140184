Growth of Proteus mirabilis harboring R100-1 (fi(+)drd str(r)cml(r)tet(r)sul(r)) factors in Penassay broth containing sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) leads to the loss of all or part of the genetic elements in high frequencies. In media containing SDS at concentrations as low as 0.03%, both lysis of R(+) cells and elimination of the R factors occur at high frequencies. Appearance of drug-susceptible cells in R(+) cultures occurs during the exponential phase of growth; however, the frequencies of susceptible cells increase substantially after the culture reaches the stationary phase. Reconstruction experiments, coupled with other observations, suggest that the major factor in altering the frequency of drug-susceptible variants is the greater resistance of the variants to the lytic action of SDS. This resistance correlates in most cases with the loss of the transfer functions in the resistance transfer factor.
