The author discusses the conditions which an experimental pyelonephritis must fulfill to provide therapeutic results which will allow the assessment of new therapeutic agents. He subjects the chosen model to the therapeutic effect of four antibiotics and three antimicrobial drugs. A numeric value is given to the bacteriuria recession slope observed during the experiment. A comparison of the results being obtained with the bacteriological and pharmacological data normally evaluated, the author demonstrates the value of the present study. The analysis of the results collected during the tests shows that comparison between antibiotics are of greater value when they are of the same family. Nevertheless, the experimental pattern, when applied to antibiotics as different as kanamycine and cephalosporins, give a very good correlation particularly when the overstepping coefficient, as proposed by Canetti, is calculated on the results expressed as free products.
