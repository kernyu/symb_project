Tye specific T antigen formation has been demonstrated in primary and secondary chick embryo cells (CEC) infected with adenovirus type 12. The frequency of cells synthesizing T antigen was closely dependent on the multiplicity of infection (MOI). At a MOI of 2.85 TCD50 per cell, T antigen was formed in 50% of cells. Cycloheximide inhibited T antigen formation while cytosine arabinoside had no such effect. CEC infected with adenovirus 12 produced interferon and T antigen, both appearing early and at about the same time of infection Exogenous chick interferon had no inhibitory effect on the formation of T antigen. In adenovirus 12-infected CEC, virus specific structural antigen could not be detected.
