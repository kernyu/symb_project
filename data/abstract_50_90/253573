The minimal inhibitory concentrations of piperacillin and seven other betalactam antibiotics were determined against 407 bacterial isolates. Piperacillin was found to be more active than ampicillin against susceptible gram-negative bacilli and more active than either carbenicillin or ticarcillin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and streptococci. Although piperacillin was active against Klebsiella pneumoniae, this activity was less than that of the cephalosporins. Piperacillin was not active against penicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Enterobacteriaceae that were resistant to the other test antibiotics.
