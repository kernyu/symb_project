In vitro enzymatic alteration of plasmid phenotype and in vitro construction of recombinant plasmids containing genetic information derived from the plasmid pSC101 have been used to investigate the mechanism of function of tetracycline resistance determined by the plasmid pSC101. The resistance has been shown to be inducible and involves the increased synthesis of membrane-associated polypeptides of 34,000, 26,000 and 14,000 daltons that are encoded for by the plasmid. The 34,000 dalton polypeptide along with another plasmid-encoded polypeptide of 18,000 daltons function in an ATP-independent manner to prevent the accumulation of tetracycline by the cell. These polypeptides are sufficient for resistance. A second component of plasmid-determined resistance involves the 14,000 dalton polypeptide and reduces the initial adsorption of tetracycline by sensitive cells, but is not alone sufficient for the generation of resistance. The role of the 26,000 dalton polypeptide in tetracycline resistance has not been identified.
