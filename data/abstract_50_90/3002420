Identification of various prognostic factors at the start of chemotherapy allows patients with gestational trophoblastic tumours to be categorized into low-, medium- and high-risk groups so that they can be given the minimum treatment necessary to eliminate their disease. Most patients in the low-risk category can be treated with minimal toxicity using a methotrexate/folinic acid regimen and these patients are not considered in this report. Before 1979 patients in the medium-risk category were treated with a sequence of drugs which included, hydroxyurea, methotrexate, 6-mercaptopurine, actinomycin D, vincristine and cyclophosphamide. Since 1979 etoposide has been substituted for vincristine and cyclophosphamide. The 76 patients treated between 1979 and 1983 are all alive and in remission 1.1.85. Three patients (4%) relapsed and required retreatment and all are in remission. Fifty-six patients in the high-risk group, most at risk of developing drug resistance, were treated with a regimen incorporating etoposide with methotrexate, actinomycin D (EMA) and vincristine and cyclophosphamide (CO). EMA and CO were given on alternate weeks, resulting in an overall survival rate of 84%. Patients who had received prior chemotherapy had a survival rate of 74% and a relapse rate of 19% compared with 93% survival and 3% relapse rate in those who had not received prior chemotherapy. Toxicity with the EMA/CO regimen was significantly less than with an earlier regimen (CHAMOCA) used in the high-risk group.
