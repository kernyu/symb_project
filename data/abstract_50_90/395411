A group of 30 independent mutants of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, resistant to the respiratory inhibitor antimycin A, was investigated from a genetical and biochemical point of view. All the mutants can be grouped into two nuclear loci: AMY1 maps on the VII chromosome, between leu 1 and trp 5; AMY2 is close to its centromere on either chromosome XVIII or XIX. Both genes do not affect mitochondrial structures or functions.
