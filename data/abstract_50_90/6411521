A system for obtaining regenerating protoplasts of highly active Bacillus licheniformis 1001 strain was developed. Transformation of protoplasts by pUB110 and pminiKC plasmids (constructed from plasmids pUB110 and pC194) leading to the expression of kanamycine resistance, was demonstrated. It is supposed that in Bac licheniformis, the pminiKC plasmid is integrated into cellular chromosome, in contrast to pUB110 and parental Bac subtilis (pminiKC) strain. Still, the integrated plasmid seems to be not completely under control of the host chromosome. As a result of such integration, the plasmid conversion takes place, resulting in alteration of cytokinesis (filament formation) and sporulation, but not interfering with the ability to produce antibiotic bacitracin.
