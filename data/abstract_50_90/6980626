Carriage of ampicillin-resistant (Ampr) Haemophilus parainfluenzae has become frequent among children in our community, although carriage of Ampr Haemophilus influenzae remains uncommon. In this study we characterized the mechanism of ampicillin resistance in 27 representative isolates of H. parainfluenzae. As determined by isoelectric focusing, each isolate had a TEM-1 beta-lactamase; substrate profiles assessed for enzymes from 10 strains were also consistent with TEM-1 enzyme. Agarose gel electrophoresis revealed a plasmid of 23 to 34 megadaltons in each isolate and a small plasmid (less than or equal to 4 megadaltons) in 14 isolates. Transfer of ampicillin resistance to H. influenzae Rd was achieved during membrane mating with 14 of 15 donors. The transconjugants exhibited high-level ampicillin resistance (greater than or equal to 50 micrograms/ml), which was stable despite serial passage of isolates on antibiotic-free media. The transconjugants tested retained fertility. Cryptic plasmids were discovered in 7 of 25 antibiotic-susceptible H. parainfluenzae isolates. Our data suggest that H. parainfluenzae may play an important role in the exchange of Ampr genes among throat bacteria.
