A mutant of Saccharomyces cerevisiae NCYC 239 with a high minimum inhibitory concentration (35 micrograms ml-1) for nystatin, compared to that of the parent strain (2 micrograms ml-1), was derived by a series of subcultures in media containing increasing antibiotic concentrations. In the absence of nystatin, the growth rate of the mutant was significantly lower than the parent strain, although mean cell-size and size-distribution were similar. No differences between strains were detectable by electron microscopy. Analysis of whole cells showed the total sterol present and the ratio of ergosterol:24(28)dehydroergosterol was similar. However, there were marked differences in amino acid content and chain-length of fatty acids in the cell wall, and protoplasts from resistant cells had decreased amounts of unsaturated fatty acids. It is suggested that alterations in cell wall components in the mutant may be directly linked to the mechanism of nystatin resistance.
