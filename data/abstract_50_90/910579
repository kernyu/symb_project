505 out of 1369 S. panama strains isolated mainly from animals, foods, and feedstuffs from 1969 to 1975 were phage-typed. 41% (= 207) of the S. panama isolates examined originated from swine, 26% from cattle and calves, 15% from dogs, and 13% were from other animal species and materials. 465 strains (=92%) showed typical reactions. 23% were specified as phage-type A, 24% as phage-type B and 36% as phage-type G. Phage-types D, E, and F did not occur. In swine, being the most frequent carriers of S. panama, phage-types A, B, and G had nearly the same shares. In dogs, phage-type G predominated to which nearly one half of the examined S. panama isolates from this species belonged. 205 (=41%) out of 505 strains examined for their resistance to antibiotics proved to be tetracycline-resistant. All 123 strains of phage-type B were tetracycline-resistant, all 35 strains of phage-type C were tetracycline-sensitive. 5 strains of phage-type A exhibited transferable tetracycline-resistance determinants.
