In the course of treating twenty patients with acute urinary tract infections, the toxicity and efficacy of a small dosage regimen (50 mg p.o., t.i.d.) of minocycline were evaluated. No vestibular symptoms attributable to minocycline treatment were observed in any of the cases entered in this study. Adverse reactions included mild nausea in 1 case and urticaria in another case. Minocycline with this dosage regimen sterilized the urine of 90% of patients with acute urinary tract infections.
