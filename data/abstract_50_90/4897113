Experimental infections were induced in weanling pigs orally both with nalidixic acid (NA)-sensitive and -resistant strains of Salmonella choleraesuis var. kunzendorf, designated RC221 and RC221NA, respectively. Prior to the time of infection, cultures of normal bacterial flora were isolated from swine fecal matter and screened for the presence of R factors. A majority of these bacterial isolates harbored transferable resistances. Both strains RC221 and RC221NA have been shown to be competent recipients in vitro of the R factors present in the normal intestinal flora. The property of NA resistance greatly facilitated recovery of the infecting organism. After infection, salmonellae from liver, lung, spleen, lymph node, intestine, and feces were screened for the presence of R factors. Transfer of drug resistance in vivo was a rare occurrence; however, if infected specimens, particularly intestinal, were incubated in nutrient broth prior to plating, R factor transfer occurred, presumably in the test tube. Changes in recipient cultures were frequently observed after introduction of R factors from organisms of pig origin into the S. choleraesuis var. kunzendorf test organisms. Alterations include changes in typing reaction, granular growth in broth, differences in colony form, and reduction of virulence.
