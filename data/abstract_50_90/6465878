Chloramphenicol-resistant mutants of Kluyveromyces lactis were isolated following manganese mutagenesis. Mutants were characterized biochemically in order to determine the effect of CAP on respiration. The genetic basis of the resistance was determined using mitotic segregation analysis of fused hybrids where the transmission of mitochondrial genes from a parent in each parasexual cross was impaired by treatment with ethidium bromide.
