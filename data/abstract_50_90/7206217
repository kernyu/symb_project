KW-1062 was administered intramuscularly at a daily dose of 360 mg for 5 days to 50 patients suffering from chronic complicated urinary tract infections. The following results were obtained. 1. Clinical response was excellent in 3 cases (6%), moderate in 23 (46%) and poor in 24 (48%); the overall effectiveness rate was 52%. 2. In bacteriological results, 58 (75.3%) out of 77 strains were eradicated and 19 strains (24.7%) persisted. P. aeruginosa was eradicated in 9 (52.9%) of 17 strains and Serratia in 10 (83.3%) of 12 strains. 3. The MIC levels of KW-1062 were slightly lower than those of gentamicin (GM) and almost the same as those of dibekacin (DKB). But against clinically isolated Serratia, KW-1062 was found to be more active than DKB. 4. As to side effects, this series showed no evidence of hepatic and renal dysfunction and hearing disturbance except a case which showed elevated GOT and GPT.
