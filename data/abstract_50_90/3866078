Cefmenoxime (CMX) was administered to protect against postoperative infections in 52 cases of cesarean section and 50 cases of total abdominal hysterectomy. These two represent common operations in the gynecological field. Group I was given the agent at a total dose of 14 g (postoperatively 4, 4, 2, 2 and 2 g), group II at a total dose of 10 g (postoperatively 2, 2, 2, 2 and 2 g) and group III at a total dose of 10 g (2 g during operation and postoperatively 2, 2, 2 and 2 g). 1. When comparing the fever index between the groups, group III showed the lowest level regardless of the type of operation. 2. When comparing clinical test values between the groups, low values of white blood cell count (P less than 0.05, P less than 0.01) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (P less than 0.05) were observed in group III with cesarean section, and significant decreases in white blood cell count (P less than 0.05) and CRP (P less than 0.01, P less than 0.001) were observed in group III with total abdominal hysterectomy. The above results indicate that the administration of CMX during operation was the most effective method of administration for protection against postoperative infections in terms of changes in fever index and clinical test values.
