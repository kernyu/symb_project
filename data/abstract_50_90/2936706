Ciprofloxacin appears to have useful activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We have studied its in-vitro activity against ten strains of Ps. aeruginosa with multiple antibiotic resistance. We have confirmed that ciprofloxacin is very active against Ps. aeruginosa with minimal inhibitory concentrations ranging from 0.07 to 0.7 mg/l. Killing curves show ciprofloxacin to be rapidly bactericidal with no regrowth after 24 h. Checkerboard studies with ciprofloxacin in combination with gentamicin, azlocillin and ceftazidime show no consistent interaction. These studies suggest that ciprofloxacin should prove a useful antibiotic in treating infections caused by multiresistant Ps. aeruginosa.
