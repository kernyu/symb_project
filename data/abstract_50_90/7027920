The efficacy of rifampicin (benemycin) in combined therapy of salmonellosis in 145 infants, including 25 newborns was studied. The data indicated that it was highly effective and superior to the other drugs, such as levomycetin, polymyxin, ampicillin and furazolidone, widely used at present for the treatment of salmonellosis in children. The efficacy of rifampicin was due to the high sensitivity to it of various Salmonella strains, including polyresistant strains of S. typhimurium, as well as the peculiar characteristics of its pharmacokinetics, i. e. the ability for rapid absorption into the blood, the effect on the bacteria located in the cells and excretion with bile. When used orally or rectally in a daily dose of 15--20 mg per 1 kg bw for a short-term treatment course rifampicin induced no side effects or allergic reactions. It is concluded that rifampicin (benemycin) may be used as a valuable reserve drug for the treatment of the severe forms of salmonellosis caused by polyresistant strains of S. typhimurium in infants and newborns. It is not advisable to use the drug for the treatment of children with moderate and nonsevere forms of salmonellosis since it may be the cause of the development of resistance to it in Salmonella.
