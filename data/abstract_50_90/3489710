A low level of recombination between homologous regions of plasmids and the host chromosome occurred during cell growth. The plasmids contained antibiotic resistance markers on the homologous regions which were only expressed when they were integrated into the chromosome. Such recombination took place in Rec+ rec-2 mutants but not in rec-1 mutants.
