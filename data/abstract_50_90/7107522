The activities of tobramycin derivatives acetylated and ethylated on the 6'-N,2'-N and 3-N positions were examined. The MICs of these derivatives against tobramycin sensitive strains indicated that 2'-N-ethylated and 6'-N-ethylated derivatives have a fairly good activity, and confirmed that the 3-N position is the most important one for antibiotic activity since 3-N derivatives were less active. The MICs of these derivatives against tobramycin resistant strains, and their inactivation by tobramycin modifying enzymes were examined. These results showed that 2'-N or 6'-N ethylation protects the drug against inactivation by AAC(2') or AAC(6'), respectively, and 2'-N-ethyltobramycin and 6'-N-ethyltobramycin were active against strains containing these modifying enzymes. On the other hand, 3-N ethylation protects the drug against inactivation by AAC(3) but 3-N-ethyl tobramycin does not inhibit strains containing this enzyme.
