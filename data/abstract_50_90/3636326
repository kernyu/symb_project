A clinical trial with Timentin (ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid) was undertaken in patients with hospital-acquired lower respiratory tract infections. Two formulations, 3.2 and 5.2 g consisting of 200 mg clavulanic acid and 3 or 5 g ticarcillin, respectively were usually given three times daily. Eighty-one patients were evaluable for clinical efficacy and 89 for tolerance. The clinical cure rate was 96% of the assessable cases even though all patients had severe concurrent or underlying diseases. The pronounced synergism between ticarcillin and clavulanic acid resulted in a bacteriological elimination rate of 94%. Adverse effects were very rare and of a mild nature, and restricted to those usually seen with the well-tolerated penicillins. No toxicological abnormalities could be detected in extensive laboratory screening. Timentin is a highly effective broad-spectrum antibiotic with good tolerance. Its potentiated action in comparison to other penicillins against beta-lactamase-producing strains, could reduce the usage of aminoglycosides in the future.
