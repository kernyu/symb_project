Rhizobium trifolii strain B1, which is infective and fixes nitrogen during symbiosis with clover plants, shows a peculiar property to undergo morphological change during growth, i.e. rods are changing into spheroplast-like forms. Moreover, it failed to grow at 38 degrees. It was found that mutation to high level of streptomycin resistance (above 1000 microgram per/ml) caused loss of this property. Further studies showed that simultaneously with the changes in streptomycin resistance other features of this strain were also changed: infectivity for clover plants, sensitivity to high temperature, phages and antibiotics. Mutation to low level of streptomycin resistance did not change the above mentioned features of the strain B1.
