A number of compounds having antiviral and antibacterial (antistaphylococcal) activity was found in the beta,beta-dichlorvinyl- and alpha-chlor(alpha-oxy)-beta,beta,beta-trichlorethylamide series of carboxylic acids. The antistaphylococcal activity of the compounds under study was found to depend, to a certain extent, ontheir chemical structure, whereas no such dependence was established in respect of their antiviral activity. In the treatment of combined influenza-staphylococcal infection a decrease in antistaphylococcal effect was observed, while antiviral activity remained stable.
