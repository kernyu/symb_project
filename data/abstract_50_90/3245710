Clinical efficacy of rifampicin, a semisynthetic broad spectrum antibiotic was estimated in 247 patients with purulent inflammations. It was shown advisable to use rifampicin intravenously in treatment of severe bronchopulmonary pathology, disorders of the bile excretion system, osteomyelitis, severe wound infections and in prophylaxis of postoperative purulent complications in cardiovascular surgery and other cases. High rifampicin sensitivity of staphylococci and streptococci belonging to various species was revealed. Rifampicin was found to be less active against gramnegative pathogens. The isolation frequency of rifampicin sensitive strains of E. coli, Proteus spp., Klebsiella spp. and P. aeruginosa amounted to 88.4, 52.1, 58.8 and 49.3 per cent respectively.
