It was found that a resistant strain R2 of C. albicans obtained as a result of passages on media containing increasing concentrations of amphotericin B differed from the initial strain by its lower pathogenicity. Treatment of the infection caused by the resistant strain on modeling of candidiasis in mice was not successful. The decrease in the average life span of the mice infected with the resistant strain R2 and treated with amphotericin B was lower than that in the control animals and such indices of the disease as the levels of the kidney dissemination and the cell vegetation even increased under the effect of amphotericin B. The results of the study suggest that the resistant strain R2 of C. albicans depend on amphotericin B in the host. The data obtained emphasize the necessity of determinining the antibiotic sensitivity of C. albicans strains isolated from patients.
