Neutralization of endogenous gamma interferon by treatment with a rat monoclonal antibody caused enhancement of infection with the protozoon Eimeria vermiformis in naive BALB/c mice. The effect was dose dependent and was apparent when a monoclonal antibody was given at 2 h before infection or up to 7 days postinfection, but it decreased with increasing time postinfection between days 4 and 7. The titers of parasite-specific antibodies in the serum were not significantly affected by the injection of monoclonal antibodies. Treatment during priming did not prevent the development of resistance to challenge, and treatment at the time of challenge did not abrogate established immunity. The results indicate that gamma interferon is involved in the control of primary infection with E. vermiformis in BALB/c mice but not in the expression of immunity to challenge.
