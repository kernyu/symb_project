The ampicillin-sulbactam combination was evaluated in vitro to determine the optimal susceptibility testing conditions among five combination ratios and four fixed concentrations of sulbactam. The organisms tested were markedly resistant to aminopenicillins and most other beta-lactams. The ratio of 2:1 is recommended to assure recognition of the ampicillin-sulbactam spectrum and minimize false-susceptible results among strains known to be resistant to this combination. Proposed MIC breakpoint concentrations were compatible with levels in serum achieved with recommended clinical doses. Cross-resistance analyses comparing ampicillin-sulbactam and amoxicillin-clavulanate showed comparable activity and spectra. However, the major interpretive disagreement was sufficient to require separate testing of these aminopenicillin-inhibitor combinations. The recommended ampicillin-sulbactam MIC susceptibility breakpoints are as follows: (i) less than or equal to 8.0/4.0 micrograms/ml for tests against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, anaerobes, nonenteric gram-negative bacilli, staphylococci, Haemophilus influenzae, and Branhamella catarrhalis; (ii) the ampicillin MICs alone interpreted by National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards criteria should predict ampicillin-sulbactam susceptibility for the enterococci, streptococci, and Listeria monocytogenes. MIC quality control ranges were determined by multiple laboratory broth microdilution trials for the ampicillin-sulbactam 1:1 and 2:1 ratio tests.
