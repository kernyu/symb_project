Susceptibility of 4-week-old mice of different strains to lethal murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) infection was studied. Strains homozygous for H-2k and C57BL strains were resistant to greater than or equal to 10(5.5) PFU. B10.BR mice congenic for C57BL background genes and H-2k were about 10-fold more resistant than either C3H/HeN or C57BL strains. BALB/c mice (H-2d) were susceptible (50% lethal dose, 10(5.05) PFU). This susceptibility was dominant over resistance associated with H-2k but not that associated with C57BL background genes. The dominant susceptibility trait segregated in backcross mice as if carried by a single gene. Virus replication in spleen cells in vivo correlated with susceptibility to lethal infection. A similar trend was found in tests of salivary glands. Replication of MCMV in vitro in cultures of adherent spleen cells and primary mouse embryo cells correlated with replication in vivo. Neutralization of interferon (IFN) in cultures of adherent spleen cells reversed H-2k-linked restriction of viral replication but had minor effects on cells of other strains. Natural killer cell responses to infection were often higher in more resistant strains, but B10.BR mice developed minimal natural killer cell responses. Specific antibody and cytotoxic T cell responses in B10.BR mice were similar or lower than in other strains. Thus, resistance to lethal MCMV infection was not immunologically mediated, was dependent on and reflected by the capacity of cells from a given mouse strain to support replication in vivo and in vitro, and was IFN dependent and recessive if linked to H-2k but IFN independent when associated with C57BL background genes.
