Mutagenicity of various mycotoxins and the efficiency of mutagenic mycotoxins in producing DNA single-strand breaks and chromosome aberrations were examined using a mammalian cell line. It was found that aflatoxin-B1, mycophenolic acid, patulin, penicillic acid, and sterigmatocystin induced 8-azaguanine-resistant mutations. Aflatoxin-B1, mycophenolic acid, and sterigmatocystin had little effect on DNA single-strand at high concentrations. In the treatment with patulin and penicillic acid, severe breaks were found at higher concentration than at the concentration where the mutation was induced. Incidence of chromosome aberrations by the treatment with these mycotoxins correlated fairly well with their mutagenic activity. Chaetoglobosin-B, fusarenon-X, (--)luteoskyrin, and ochratoxin-A did not induce 8-azaguanine-resistant mutation.
