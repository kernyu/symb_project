The efficacy of chloroquine and pyrimethamine as malaria chemoprophylactics was investigated in young Nigerian children. Chloroquine resistance had not been documented in the study area; pyrimethamine resistance was probably present but uncommon. Children who received weekly chemoprophylaxis with pyrimethamine had a lower prevalence of malaria parasitaemia and malaria antibodies than children who received weekly chemoprophylaxis with chloroquine. Pyrimethamine given monthly gave a comparable degree of protection to chloroquine given weekly. Chloroquine frequently induced vomiting in young children and this may have impaired its efficacy as a prophylactic. We conclude that, in an area where neither chloroquine nor pyrimethamine resistance is prevalent, pyrimethamine is a better chemoprophylactic for young children than chloroquine.
