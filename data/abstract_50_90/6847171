A total of 229 clinical isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae recovered from 225 patients were serotyped and tested for susceptibility to penicillin G, ampicillin, mezlocillin, cefazolin, erythromycin, clindamycin, chloramphenicol, and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim. Of all the isolates, 48 (21.0%) showed intermediate resistance and 17 (7.4%) showed resistance to penicillin G. Penicillin-resistant strains had higher minimal inhibitory concentrations of ampicillin, mezlocillin, and cefazolin than did penicillin-susceptible strains. Resistance to erythromycin and clindamycin was rare (1.3 and 0.9%, respectively). Of the isolates, 8.7% were resistant to sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, and all were susceptible to chloramphenicol. Penicillin resistance was associated with 13 serotypes. Serotypes 14, 19F, 19A, and 23F were both highly prevalent and frequently penicillin resistant.
