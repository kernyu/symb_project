The effect of polymyxin on two sets of Salmonella mutants was studied by thin-section and scanning electron microscopy. Polymyxin (in increasing concentrations, starting just below bactericidal effect) caused the appearance of the previously described rodlike projections on the cell surface of wild-type (smooth, polymyxin-sensitive) bacteria. These projections seemed to involve the outer membrane of the cell wall. In rough mutants, which are deficient in lipopolysaccharide, the projections were much smaller and flat. Higher concentrations of polymyxin were required to produce morphological effects in polyxmin-resistant mutants of both smooth and rough forms. Furthermore, in these mutants polymyxin caused vesicle-like bulging of the total outer membrane quite different in appearance from the rodlike projections of the wild type.
