A patient who contracted urethritis from a beta-lactamase-producing strain of Neisseria gonorrhoeae was successfully treated with the cephalosporin derivative cefuroxime. As expected, neither cefuroxime nor cefamandole was hydrolysed by plasmid-coded gonococcal beta-lactamase. Cefuroxime ought to be a valuable and efficacious substitute for penicillins in the treatment of gonhorrhoea due to beta-lactamase-producing gonococcal strains.
