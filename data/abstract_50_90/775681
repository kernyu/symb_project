550 Strains of E. coli, isolated from poultry, were typed. In addition, their sensitivity to various drugs was tested. A wide variety of serotypes was found to be present. Approximately 50% of the isolated strains of E. coli were found to be resistant to the tetracyclines, streptomycin and sulphafurazole. Chloramphenicol, neomycin and furazolidone usually were effective.
