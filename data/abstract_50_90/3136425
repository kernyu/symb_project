The evolution of the prevalence of the bacterial strains isolated from UTI cases (bacteriuria greater than or equal to 10(5)/ml has been studied over a 11 year-period from 1976 to 1986, in a clinical practice microbiological laboratory from a rural area. E. coli was the overall most frequently isolated species, followed by P. mirabilis (74.4% and 11.2% respectively), by the Klebsiella-Enterobacter group (4.8%), and staphylococci (represented by coagulase negative staphylococci) (4.9%). The relative frequency of the different species has been relatively stable year after year during the considered period. The evolution of the resistance to 4 antibiotics has been studied species by species and year after year for the Gram negative bacilli: a definite evolution towards resistance has been noted for ampicillin until 1985, followed by a decrease in 1986. The same tendency, although less pronounced, has been noted for cotrimoxazole. The frequency of the resistance to nalidixic acid has slightly increased from 1976 to 1986 (1.9% to 6.5%), as well as to pipemidic acid from (0% to 4%). The quinolones stand in 1987 as a good first line treatment of UTI in community, and especially in rural areas, and the role of the clinical practice microbiological laboratory for the epidemiological surveillance has to be stressed.
