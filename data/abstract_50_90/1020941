The study of the staphylococcal population heterogeneity with respect to methicillin resistance by 2 methods revealed different numbers of the resistant cells in the population. Thus, when the microbial suspension was plated on an agarized medium with methicillin (50 gamma/ml), only 0.0007--0.0005 per cent of the resistant cells were found. When the colonies were replicated from a medium without methicillin to a medium containing methicillin (50 gamma/ml), 84.3--97.3 per cent of the resistant microbial cells were found in the population of the same strains. The main mechanism in the heterogeneity of the staphylococcal population with respect to methicillin resistance was impairement of the phenotype manifestation of the antibiotic resistance under definite conditions.
