Genetic nature of the bacteriogenicity factor of the Staphylococcus epidermidis No. 259 strain was studied by acting upon the strain with ultraviolet irradiation, acridine orange at a temperature of 37 and 44 degrees C, and cultivation of the strain at a temperature of 44 degrees C for 24 and 96 hours. The most effective elimination of the bacteriocinogenicity factor was reached with the action of acridine orange at 44 degrees C and the strain passage at 44 degrees C for 96 hours. A study of 212 subcultures which lost the bacteriocinogenicity factor under the effect of various factors demonstrated that they failed to differ by properties from the initial strain and retained the bacteriocin resistance of the initial strain. A conclusion was drawn that the bacteriocinogenicity factor was an extrachomosomic agent, and was not associated with any other strain properties.
