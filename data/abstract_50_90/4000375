The offspring of rats fed a diet containing 12.5% (v/v) ethanol prior to, and during, gestation (LTE) were compared to the offspring of rats fed the same diet during gestation only (STE) in three studies. In Study I the neonates were tested on a variety of neuroreflex tasks, in Study II the offspring were tested in an activity wheel and open field, and in Study III the offspring were trained in a runway under partial or consistent reward conditions. Results indicated that STE offspring were delayed in developing fur and in opening their eyes, they righted more rapidly, and were slower in developing a reaction to and habituating to an auditory stimulus than their controls (STC) and the LTE offspring. Generally, movement was greater for ethanol exposed offspring and the LTE offspring showed more persistent fear-related responses than the STE offspring. No statistically reliable differences in learning or extinction were found among the groups, although a trend towards better learning and less resistance to extinction was noted in the LTE animals. Long-term alcohol use seems to attenuate the effects of gestational alcohol in rats.
