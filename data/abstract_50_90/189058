A thick fibrous walling of amoebic abscess of the liver is very rare. Using as a basis the case of drug and immunodiagnostic resistant amoebic liver abscess in an adult Nigerian, an account is given of the possible mechanisms for such therapeutic and diagnostic failure. A theory of blood-abscess cavity barrier is postulated and suggested as a mechanism for the constant failure to detect antibodies to E. histolytica in the small percentage of cases of amoebic liver abscess (Morris, Powell and Elsdon-Dew, 1970). A study of the rate of diffusion of amoebic excretion/secretion through a thick fibrous tissue or artificial membrane of comparable properties is strongly advocated.
