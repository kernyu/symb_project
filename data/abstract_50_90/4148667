Transformation of the pneumococcus mutant 401 by DNA's bearing the standard reference marker and several other markers belonging to two unlinked loci has shown that differences in the integration efficiencies of these markers were considerably reduced in this strain compared to the wild-type strain Cl(3). The sensitivities of mutant 401 to ultraviolet light and to X-ray irradiation are the same as those of Cl(3). However, in 401 all the markers tested are more resistant to inactivation as shown by transformation of 401 and Cl(3) by ultraviolet-irradiated DNA. The increase in resistance is greater for low efficiency (LE) markers than for high efficiency (HE) markers.-The decreased discrimination between LE and HE markers in strain 401 is not due to a mechanism related to modification of markers in the transforming DNA by the recipient cells, nor are the proteins inducing competence of the cells responsible for the differences in the integration efficiencies of various markers.-Genetic studies of the fate of recombinants as well as the measure of the amount of DNA taken up have shown that all the markers are integrated in strain 401 by the same recombination process, that specific to high efficiency markers.
