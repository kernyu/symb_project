Two-cell and four-cell preimplantation mouse embryos were cocultured in vitro with fibroblasts producing the recombinant retrovirus M-MuLV-neo. No wildtype helper virus was detected in these cultures. Of the embryos that survived the in vitro cultivation and the reimplantation into foster mothers, 2 of 15 that were tested contained the proviral genome. The provirus integrated as a single copy at a unique site. We estimate that approximately equal to 20% of the cells in each of the two transgenic fetuses contained the provirus.
