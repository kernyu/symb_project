The concentration of Ceftizoxime (CZX) was determined in the prostatic tissue and serum of 130 patients with benign prostatic hypertrophy. Two grams of CZX was given by intravenous injection prior to TUR. The mean value of CZX levels in prostatic tissue and prostatic level/serum levels ratio (p/s ratio) after administration were 47.2 +/- 2.8 micrograms/g, 49.1% at 30 minutes, 33.3 +/- 2.2 micrograms/g, 51.4% at one hour, 22.2 +/- 2.7 micrograms/g, 60.8% at 2 hours, 13.6 +/- 3.9 micrograms/g, 64.2% at 4 hours, 3.04 +/- 0.54 micrograms/g, 74.5% at 8 hours, respectively. In conclusion, the concentration of CZX in the prostatic tissues attained the minimal inhibitory concentration of 80% for the gram-negative bacteria, the excluding P. aeruginosa. Thus clinical effectiveness of CZX could be expected on bacterial prostatitis and bacterial infection after prostatic operations.
