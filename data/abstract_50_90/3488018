A cefoxitin-resistant Bacteroides fragilis isolate, TAL 4170, which inactivates cefoxitin, was able to transfer beta-lactamase-mediated cefoxitin resistance to a susceptible B. fragilis recipient. Cefoxitin-resistant transconjugants acquired a new beta-lactamase with a pI of 8.1 and were able to inactivate cefoxitin and retransfer cefoxitin resistance. No plasmids were detected in the donor or transconjugants.
