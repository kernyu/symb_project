Experimental and clinical studies on ceftizoxime (CZX), a new cephalosporin derivative, were carried out and the following results were obtained. 1. The minimal inhibitory concentrations of CZX, cefazolin (CEZ), cephalothin (CET), cefotiam (CTM) and cefmetazole (CMZ) against Gram-positive cocci (31 strains) and Gram-negative rods (169 strains) isolated from the patients with oral infections were determined. CZX, though somewhat less active against Gram-positive cocci than the other cephalosporins, was the most active of the antibiotics tested against Gram-negative rods. 2. The mean serum levels in 19 patients who received 1 g of CZX by intravenous drip infusion for 1 hour were as follows. 19.6 micrograms/ml 30 minutes after the start of intravenous drip infusion, 52.2 micrograms/ml after 1 hour, 25.0 micrograms/ml after 1.5 hours, 20.3 micrograms/ml after 2 hours, 7.9 micrograms/ml after 4 hours, 3.5 micrograms/ml after 6 hours. The mean peak tissue levels of CZX after 1 g dose by intravenous drip infusion for 1 hour were 14.3 micrograms/g (n = 5) in gingiva and 8.5 micrograms/g (n = 2) in bone marrow at the end of intravenous drip infusion. 3. CZX was administered to 17 patients with various infections in the oral surgical field at daily dose of 1 approximately 2 g for 3 approximately 6 days. The therapeutic effect was as follows: 'excellent' in 6 cases, 'good' in 9, 'fair' in 1 and 'poor' in 1. The final rate of effectiveness was 88.2%. No adverse reaction was observed except for 2 cases of slight elevation of S-GPT.
