We have developed a technique for cannulation and internal perfusion of crayfish segmented lateral axons. Experiments on perfused and non-perfused axons lead to the following conclusions: 1. Internally perfused segmented axons behave very similarly to non-perfused axons. 2. The axial electrical resistance of the junctional region is almost as low as a comparable segment of axon. 3. Neither intracellular Ca2+ nor H+ is effective in disrupting the intercellular communication pathway in perfused axons. On the basis of these findings we have formulated a hypothesis for cellular control of intercellular coupling based on the existence of a soluble intermediate for Ca2+ or H+-induced uncoupling. This hypothesis is consistent with data from both internally perfused and non-perfused axons.
