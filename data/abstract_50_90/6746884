Vibrio fluvialis and Vibrio furnissii have been associated with diarrhea but have rarely been isolated in the United States. We received strains of V. fluvialis and V. furnissii that were isolated from the stool of a 1-month-old baby. A description of these two strains and the case history of the patient are given in this report.
