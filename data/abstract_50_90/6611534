The antimicrobial susceptibility of 106 strains of Campylobacter jejuni/coli recovered from animals and humans was studied using broth microdilution panel. Human and animal strains exhibit similar susceptibility, with the exception of the strains from pigs which are more resistant to erythromycin and clindamycin. Among the hippurate negative strains (C. coli), these strains are also recognizable from those recovered from other hosts.
