We immortalized the GG2EE macrophage (M phi) cell line by infection of freshly isolated bone marrow cells with the recombinant J2 retrovirus carrying v-raf and v-myc oncogenes. We investigated the expression of J2 virus mRNA in relationship with the proliferative ability and tumoricidal activity of GG2EE cells exposed to biologic response modifiers (BRM). Calcium ionophore (Ca2+I), picolinic acid (PA), or IFN-gamma were employed to activate GG2EE cells. Each BRM was due to inhibit the proliferation of GG2EE cells in a dose-dependent manner, whereas only Ca2+I or the combined treatment with PA plus IFN-gamma induced tumoricidal GG2EE cells. J2 virus mRNA expression was not affected by PA or IFN-gamma, but it was dramatically decreased by Ca2+I or PA plus IFN-gamma. These results indicated that the expression of J2 mRNA can be inhibited in GG2EE cells by appropriate BRM such as Ca2+I or IFN-gamma plus PA. In contrast, the expression of 2'5'-oligoadenylate synthetase mRNA was augmented to similar levels by treatment of the GG2EE cells with IFN-gamma alone or in combination with PA. The down-regulation of J2 mRNA expression was not associated with the antiproliferative activity of the BRM but rather with their ability to induce tumoricidal activity. These results suggest that the process of activation of tumoricidal macrophages also triggers a mechanism(s) of resistance to viral mRNA expression. Moreover, the finding that IFN-gamma or PA inhibit cell proliferation but not J2 mRNA expression indicates that the intracellular targets of these BRM are intact, independent from and unaffected by J2 virus expression.
