Ultraviolet absorption data and thermal chromatography through hydroxyapatite (HAP) column revealed that furazolidone treatment of Vibrio cholerae cells produced more than 80% of DNA reversibly bihelical due to the formation of interstrand cross-links and the reaction obeyed a first order relation. Sensitivities of the Escherichia coli strains to the lethal action of the drug were in the order: AB 2480(uvr- rec-) greater than AB 2463(rec-) greater than AB 1886(uvr-) greater than AB 1157(repair proficient) or AB 4401(wild type). Furazolidone was 'Rec test' positive, produced dose-dependent prophage induction in E. coli cells and also dose-dependent streptomycin-resistance forward mutation in V. cholerae cells. The quantitative aspect and also the mode of furazolidone action on DNA were discussed.
