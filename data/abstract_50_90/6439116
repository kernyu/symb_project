The in vitro activity of enoxacin (CI 919, AT 2266), a new oral quinolone carboxylic acid compound, was compared with those of gentamicin, tobramycin, amikacin, azlocillin, piperacillin, aztreonam, moxalactam, imipenem, cefsulodin, ceftazidime, and cefoperazone against 101 aminoglycoside-susceptible and 105 aminoglycoside-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains. Among these 206 P. aeruginosa isolates were 25 strains with known mechanisms of resistance to amikacin. The activity of enoxacin was similar to that of tobramycin against aminoglycoside-susceptible strains, with MICs of 1.0 to 2.0 micrograms/ml and 0.5 to 1.0 microgram/ml, respectively, for 90% of the strains. Enoxacin was the most active agent in this in vitro study against aminoglycoside-resistant P. aeruginosa strains, with MICs of 2.0 to 4.0 micrograms/ml for 90% of the strains. Strains with enzymatic resistance to amikacin were more resistant to beta-lactams (except enoxacin and imipenem) than were strains with decreased permeability.
