An antibiotic drug of aminoglycoside group, tobramycin (TOB) for parenteral use was used to 18 hospitalized patients: 5 with cholecystitis, 10 with acute appendicitis and 3 others. TOB in a dose of 60-90 mg were administered before the operation, 9 cases were administered by intravenous drip infusion for 1-2 hours, 7 cases by intramuscularly and 2 cases by intravenously. The materials of A-bile, B-bile, wall of the gallbladder, the appendix, ascites and serum samples were taken during the operation. TOB concentration was measured by bioassay method with Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633 strain. TOB concentration in B-bile and gallbladder wall were higher than those in the A-bile. TOB concentration in gallbladder wall and appendix were directly proportional to degree of pathological changes of the inflammation. For the therapeutic purpose, TOB were given to the 15 patients of the above 18 cases. TOB in a dose of 60-90 mg were administered by intravenous drip infusion for 1-2 hours, twice or 3 times a day for 3-18 days. Clinical response was excellent in 2 cases, good in 11 cases, fair in 1 case and poor in 1 case. No adverse effect was observed. Therefore, it was supposed that TOB could be used safety by intravenous drip infusion.
