Four beta-lactam antibiotics, cefazolin, cefamandole, cefoxitin, and cefuroxime, were tested for their ability to penetrate the bacterial cell wall, to inhibit target proteins, and to resist degradation by beta-lactamase enzymes. Cefuroxime was the only tested antibiotic that performed well in all three categories.
