A total of 118 epidemiologically related Staphylococcus epidermidis strains from hospital patients, staff, and fomites were examined with a provisional set of 18 typing phages. Seventy (59.3%) of these strains were typed using phage concentrations of 100 times routine test dilution. The remainder were nontypable. Thirty-six (30.5%) of the strains were of related phage types, 71/108/275A/459 and 71/108/275A. These latter strains were associated with clinical S. epidermidis endocarditis in patients with prosthetic valve replacements. Ninety-eight strains were characterized by the Baird-Parket biotyping schema. Eighty-three (84.7%) were biotype 1, and the majority (68.4%) of these were resistant to penicillin, ampicillin, methicillin, cephalothin, erythromycin, and clindamycin. Type 71, 71/108/275A/459, 71/108/275A and 71/108/275/459 strains were generally resistant to penicillin, ampicillin, erythromycin, and methicillin, whereas a less consistent resistance pattern was noted among miscellaneous and nontypable strains.
