Spontaneous mutants of mouse FM3A cells (AC1, AC2, and AC3), highly resistant to aphidicolin (3000-, 2500-, and 300-fold increase in resistance, respectively), were isolated by multistep selection. The DNA synthesizing activity in permeabilized cells of all three mutants was substantially resistant to aphidicolin, like that in intact cells. The DNA polymerase activity in nuclear extracts in AC1 and AC3, but not AC2, was resistant to aphidicolin. Partially purified DNA polymerase alpha from AC3, but not from AC1 or AC2, showed resistance to aphidicolin. The apparent Ki value for aphidicolin of AC3 polymerase alpha was three to four times that of the enzyme from the parent cells, but the apparent Km values of the enzyme for dCTP and dTTP were normal. All the mutants showed cross-resistance to both arabinofuranosyladenine and arabinofuranosylcytosine. The AC3 mutant had expanded deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate pools. On two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, AC1 gave a new protein (mol wt 40 kDa). The aphidicolin-resistance trait was reversible in AC2, unlike in AC1 and AC3. These results show that in mammalian cells there are at least two mechanisms of aphidicolin-resistance that involve an altered DNA polymerase alpha that is resistant to aphidicolin and simultaneous expansion of the four DNA-precursor pools.
