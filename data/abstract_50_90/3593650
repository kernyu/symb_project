A prospective study was undertaken to determine the effectiveness of an empirical antibiotic therapy regimen in 34 neutropenic patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation or remission-induction chemotherapy for leukaemia. Throughout the study period a total of 90 pyrexial episodes were monitored in which organisms designated to be pathogens were isolated from blood cultures on 38 occasions. The response rate to the combination of a ureidopenicillin with gentamicin fell sharply from 50% during patients' first pyrexial episodes to zero during the third and subsequent episodes. The preponderance of Gram-positive bacteria and the high overall resistance of bacterial isolates to these antibiotics have led us to reconsider our approach to empirical therapy and to include antibiotics with greater activity against Staphylococcus epidermidis. The emergence of fungi as a major cause of morbidity in patients with prolonged neutropenia underlines the necessity to introduce early empirical antifungal therapy in this group of patients.
