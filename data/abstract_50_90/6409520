An agar dilution technique was used to determine the MIC of pristinamycin for 124 clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. All were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.5 mg/1, quite similar to the sensitivity of a number of methicillin-sensitive strains. MICs obtained using a microdilution method were also comparable. Antagonism was seen with the combination of pristinamycin and erythromycin.
