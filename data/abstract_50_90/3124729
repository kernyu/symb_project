Beginning in 1985, relatively penicillin G-resistant (Penr) meningococci which did not produce beta-lactamase were isolated from the blood and cerebrospinal fluid of patients in Spain. We identified 16 Penr (mean MIC, 0.3 microgram/ml; range, 0.1 to 0.7 microgram/ml) and 12 penicillin-susceptible (Pens; mean MIC, less than or equal to 0.06 microgram/ml) strains of Neisseria meningitidis by the agar dilution technique using an inoculum of 10(4) CFU and questioned which disk susceptibility test would best differentiate these two populations. We compared the disk susceptibility of these strains using disks containing 2 (P2) and 10 (P10) U of penicillin G, 2 (Am2) and 10 (Am10) micrograms of ampicillin, and 1 microgram of oxacillin (OX1). We also investigated susceptibility with disks containing 30 micrograms of each of cephalothin (CF30), cefoxitin (FOX30), cefuroxime (CXM30), and cefotaxime (CTX30) and 75 micrograms of cefoperazone (CFP75) and determined by cluster analysis any correlation with the zone diameters obtained with P2 disks. Using the P2 and AM2 disks (in contrast to the P10 and AM10 disks), we correctly differentiated all the Penr from Pens isolates. In addition, the zone diameters with the P2 disk gave the best correlation with the penicillin G MIC determinations. All 16 Penr strains and 3 of 12 Pens strains showed zone diameters of 6 mm around OX1 disks, limiting the usefulness of OX1 disks. The zone diameters obtained with CF30, CXM30, and OX1 disks correlated with those obtained with the P2 disk, which suggests that these antibiotics have similar effects on these strains. In contrast, the data obtained with FOX30, CTX30, and CFP75 disks did not cluster with those obtained with the P2 disk, which suggests that there was a difference in the bacterial target or reflects their greater activity. We conclude that the P2 disk tests more readily identify Penr meningococci than do the standard P10 disk tests.
