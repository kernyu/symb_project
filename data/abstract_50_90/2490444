The results obtained in the CNMVIS from 1983 to 1987 are reported for the different mycobacterial species identified, the susceptibility of M. tuberculosis to drugs, and the age and sex distribution of the infected patients, to provide additional data regarding the status of mycobacteriosis in this country. 3682 of the 4,015 isolated mycobacteria were identified as tuberculous; among these, the vast majority (99.4%) corresponded to M. tuberculosis. The other mycobacterial species amounted to 25 varieties. On the other hand, no significant changes developed during the five year period regarding predominance of the different species. Primary resistance of M. tuberculosis to chemotherapeutic agents was observed in 7.5% of instances, and acquired resistance in 25.4%; isoniazid, streptomycin and rifampin were the drugs to which resistance more commonly developed. The sex distribution of the affected individuals disclosed a mean males/females ratio of 3.7:1, as shown in similar studies. However, the age distribution did not fit with the reported pattern for other european countries, as in our study there was a greater frequency of tuberculosis in young adults aged 20-39 years.
