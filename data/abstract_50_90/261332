Cefamandole is a new cephalosporin active against non beta-lactamase producing enterobacteria, at lower concentrations (mean of MIC: 0.79 mcg/ml) than those of cefalothin taken as a reference amongst current cephalosporins (mean of MIC: 6.84 mcg/ml). This improved activity was also seen against enterobacteria producing extra-chromosomal penicillinase (mean of MIC: 3.59 mcg/ml for cefamandole and 12.76 mcg/ml for cefalothin). These findings would suggest that cefamandole is better able to reach the site of action of beta-lactamines within the bacteria. In contrast to current cephalosporins, cefamandole is active against enterobacteria producing chromosomal cephalosporinase, by virtue of its stability against the hydrolytic activity of this type of enzyme. It thus is the leader of a new generation of cephalosporins.
