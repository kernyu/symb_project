Pseudomonas cepacia was recovered from a number of infected sites in three patients with chronic granulomatous disease of childhood. The organisms were identified on the basis of their oxidative utilization of a variety of carbohydrates and their positive beta-galactosidase and oxidase activities. They were resistant to most antimicrobial agents and moderately susceptible to chloramphenicol. Peripheral blood leukocytes isolated from two siblings with chronic granulomatous disease, including one of the patients in this series, failed to kill P. cepacia in vitro. Prolonged prophylactic and antimicrobial therapy may well have played a significant role in the colonization and infection of these patients with P. cepacia.
