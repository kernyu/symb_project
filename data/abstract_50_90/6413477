The resistance of bacterial spore monitors is markedly influenced by the environmental conditions existing during development of spores and, subsequently, in the preparation and evaluation of the monitor. Sporulation medium, suspending medium, pasteurization and storage conditions influence resistance of spores of Bacillus subtilis var. niger to ethylene oxide, but incubation temperature and age of sporulating culture appear to be unimportant. The conditions under which the spore suspension is dried on the supporting medium of the monitor exerts a major influence on resistance. Spores exposed to ethylene oxide are abnormally susceptible to damage by shaking with Ballotini, a method frequently used to recover spores from monitors. Nutritional conditions, pH and temperature of incubation influence the ability of survivors to form colonies on solidified media.
