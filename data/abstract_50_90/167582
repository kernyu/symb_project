Anaerobic bacterial organisms are a frequent cause of female genital tract infections. There has been a lack of appreciation of the significant role anaerobes play in obstetric and gynecologic infections. Utilization of newer appropriate anaerobic culture techniques has shown the importance of these organisms as pathogens in serious infections of the genital tract. Many species of anaerobic bacteria appear to be part of the normal microflora of the lower genital tract in female subjects. Similar organisms are frequently isolated from pelvic infections. Bacteroides, anaerobic cocci, and Clostridia are the most commonly isolated anaerobes associated with clinical infections. The clinician must recognize the presence of anaerobic infections, utilize proper anaerobic culture methods, and institute appropriate antibiotic and/or surgical therapy.
