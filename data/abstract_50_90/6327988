Most phage-Group-II Staphylococcus aureus have been shown to carry at least one plasmid. The proportion of strains that are resistant to tetracycline appears to have increased during the last 17 years. Restriction maps of several of the small plasmids isolated from Group-II strains are presented and compared with those known for staphylococcal plasmids. These small plasmids are similar to previously characterised plasmids from staphylococci of other phage groups.
