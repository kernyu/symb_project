During the three years 1985 to 1987 an increasing number of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains were identified in New Zealand each year. A total of 66 strains of MRSA were identified among isolates received from 418 patients and health personnel. The majority (337/418, 80.6%) of the isolates were from two independent large outbreaks of MRSA. All strains of MRSA were sensitive to vancomycin, rifampicin and fusidic acid. An overseas origin, usually Australia, was identified for 48.4% of strains. The majority of isolates were from patients whose host defences had been breached. Postoperative and cutaneous wounds were the commonest sites of acquisition.
