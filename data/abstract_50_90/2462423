The electropermeabilization (EPN) of living cells allows the uptake of non-permeant molecules and can reveal their potential activity on cells without the constraints of the plasma membrane crossing. We decided to compare the cytotoxicity of some anticancer drugs on electropermeabilized (EP) and non-permeabilized (NEP) cultured DC-3F cells exposed to the drugs for a short time. After EPN, the increase in cytotoxicity varies between 1 and more than 700 times, depending on the usual cell uptake pathway of a given drug. The most relevant increase of toxicity was observed with molecules such as netropsin (200-fold) and bleomycin (700-fold) which in ordinary conditions weakly diffuse through the plasma membrane. Only a 3-5-fold increase of the cytotoxicity was observed with lipophilic drugs able to rapidly diffuse through the plasma membrane (actinomycin D, NMHE) both in the case of drug-sensitive and resistant cell strains. This increased toxicity is clearly related to a facilitated uptake because, after electropermeabilization, the effects of melphalan (a drug which enters intact cells via leucine transporters) are not modulated by the external leucine concentration. Thus, EPN enables us to reveal the intrinsic toxicity of hydrophilic molecules which have a limited access to their intracellular targets. We propose that EPN can be used as a novel screening procedure of new cytotoxic molecules which could be modified thereafter in order to facilitate their cellular uptake.
