A V79 Chinese hamster fibroblast cell line selected for resistance to the toxic effects of 5-fluorouracil (Kaufman, 1984b) was found to be cross-resistant to the toxic effects of the thymidine analog 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd). When tested for sensitivity to BrdUrd mutagenesis, the fluorouracil-resistant cells were found to be resistant to mutagenesis induced by high concentrations of BrdUrd in the medium (INC mutagenesis) but not to mutagenesis induced by the replication of DNA containing 5-bromouracil (REP mutagenesis). Analyses of deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate pools indicated that high endogenous dCTP levels in the mutant prevented the high BrdUTP/dCTP ratio associated with INC mutagenesis. However, the mutant phenotype had no effect on the nucleotide pool imbalance associated with REP mutagenesis. This mutant provides further genetic evidence for the existence of two independent mechanisms for BrdUrd mutagenesis in mammalian cells.
