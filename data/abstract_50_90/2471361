The results of the study of the effect of double-stranded (ds) RNA from killer yeasts Sac. cerevisiae on the parameters of nonspecific protection are presented. Inoculation of dsRNA in a dose of 5 mg/kg intramuscularly was shown to induce interferon production, to increase body temperature, the activity of adrenal cortex, phagocytic activity of macrophages of the peritoneal exudate and blood neutrophils, the level of lysozyme in the blood, and the activity of macrophage acid phosphatase. The increase in the functional activity of the system components was observed at similar intervals, within 3-6 hours after administration of the preparation. The mutual induction of factors of nonspecific protection and their cooperative participation in the formation of antiviral resistance under the effect of dsRNA is discussed.
