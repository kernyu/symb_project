Susceptibilities in various types of clinical isolates to cefmetazole (CMZ) were determined by the disk method and the serial agar dilution method for MIC measurement. CMZ showed high antibacterial activity for all Gram-positive cocci except E. faecalis, and for H. influenzae, E. coli, Klebsiella sp. and Proteus sp.. CMZ was administered on 33 patients with infections, mainly biliary tract infections, in the field of internal medicine. The clinical efficacy of the drug was 86.7% for infections of the biliary tract, 80.0% for respiratory tract infections, 100% for urinary tract infections and 76.7% for all cases. There were no adverse reaction or changes in laboratory findings caused by CMZ in any of the patients.
