Topical antibacterial treatment is of major importance in the burn patient. Silver sulfadiazine is an effective agent with low toxicity and few side effects. Deposition of silver in tissues, and absorption of sulfadiazine are both minimal. Present and future problems are represented by the emergence of resistant Gram negative bacilli, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The development of related metal sulfadiazines to be used against resistant bacteria is on an investigational stage, and clinical trials are few. Silver sulfadiazine may be used in a variety of other conditions than burns.
