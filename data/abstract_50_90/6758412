The analysis of 168 patients with chronic infections of the urinary tract served to clarify whether different findings are obtained concerning the spectrum of germs and resistance in cases of primary, secondary monoinfected and secondary superinfected pyelonephritis. It was found that in cases of secondary obstructive pyelonephritis the degree of chemotherapeutic sensitivity is reduced and especially where problem germs (proteus, pseudomonas, Klebsiella) are concerned therapy will hardly be successful except by means of aminoglycosides. In this context the recognition and senitation of multifactorial urological primary diseases which cause infection are of special importance.
