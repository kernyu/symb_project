Escherichia coli Sd-4-73 drug dependent strain was sensitive to kanamycin, gentamicin and neomycin in the absence of drugs stimulating cell multiplication. This senstivity was not considerably influenced by streptomycin, while paromomycin afforded protection against both bacteriostatic and bactericidal effects. The paromomycin concentration optimum for protection was different from its concentration optimum for multiplication.
