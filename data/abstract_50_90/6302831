In a non-randomised trial 15 women with Staphylococcus saprophyticus bacteriuria were treated with pivmecillinam 200 mg t.i.d. for 1 week. At follow-up 2-4 weeks post treatment only 11 patients were cured. As a complement to the study the occurrence of Staph. saprophyticus bacteriuria was analysed according to age, sex and season. Mecillinam MIC's and viability curves of Staph. saprophyticus were investigated. It is concluded that mecillinam should only be used to treat urinary tract infections caused by bacteria sensitive in vitro.
