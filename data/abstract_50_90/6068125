Microorganisms isolated from chlortetracycline (CTC)-treated ocean perch were individually tested to determine their relative sensitivity to CTC by use of CTC-impregnated paper discs. The CTC sensitivity varied among isolates obtained from untreated fish. The proportion of CTC-resistant species increased with higher CTC concentration and the length of storage at 7 C. Among individual generic groups, "coryneforms" and yeasts were more resistant to CTC than other groups. Pseudomonas, Achromobacter, Flavobacterium, Bacillus, and Lactobacillus all contained species either resistant or sensitive to CTC. More CTC-resistant species in these genera accumulated with the increased CTC concentrations and with the length of storage in the presence of CTC.
