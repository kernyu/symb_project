Aphidicolin is an antibiotic of novel structure produced by the mold Cephalosporium aphidicola. It is a potent inhibitor of cellular deoxyribonucleic acid synthesis, and it also strongly inhibits the growth of herpes simplex virus both in tissue culture and in the rabbit eye. Aphidicolin is active against iododeoxyuridine-resistant herpes virus, and does not itself readily induce the formation of drug-resistant strains of herpesvirus.
