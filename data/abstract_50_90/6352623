Eighteen patients were evaluated after treatment with ceftazidime: these included nine nosocomial lower respiratory tract infections, four soft tissue infections, three bacteraemias and two bone infections. Thirty-five bacterial pathogens were isolated from these 18 patients. Two were resistant to ceftazidime and required alternative therapy. Sixteen of the 18 evaluable patients had a favourable response to ceftazidime. Seven of eight patients with Pseudomonas aeruginosa lower respiratory tract infections responded favourably. Fifteen possible complications were observed in ten of 23 patients who received ceftazidime. In three patients ceftazidime was discontinued due to possible complications of therapy. This trial provides preliminary support for the use of ceftazidime as an alternative to aminoglycosides in the treatment of serious infections caused by Gram-negative organisms, including Ps. aeruginosa.
