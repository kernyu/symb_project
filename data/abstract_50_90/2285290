The resistance mechanisms of methicillin-resistant strains of Staphylococcus saprophyticus were characterized. Penicillin-binding protein (PBP) studies demonstrated an inducible PBP identical to PBP 2a in the membranes of these isolates. The amount of beta-lactamase produced was minimal. PBP 2a is responsible for the methicillin resistance observed in these strains of S. saprophyticus.
