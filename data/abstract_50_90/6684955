Cells of a nystatin-resistant mutant of the obligatory aerobic yeast Rhodotorula gracilis displayed an electrical potential difference, delta psi, across the plasma membrane which was, in contrast to the wild-strain cells, virtually independent of the pH of cell suspensions down to 4.5. In addition, the delta psi in mutant cells was insensitive to extracellular K+ concentrations. The mutant cells failed to cotransport measurable amounts of H+ by the onset of monosaccharide transport and to take up K+ in exchange for H+. Taking into account the lower passive permeability of the mutant plasma membrane for cations, it has been concluded that the pH dependency of delta psi in wild-strain cells is correlated with the electrogenic leak of H+ back into the cells in course of increasing delta pH across the plasma membrane.
