Potent sheep anti-mouse interferon globulin has been used to determine the role of virus-induced interferon in mouse hepatitis virus type 3-infected susceptible (C57BL/6), semiresistant (C3H/He), and resistant (A/J) strains of mice. Injection of anti-interferon globulin accelerated the onset of death in C57BL/6 mice, induced almost 100% mortality in C3H/He mice that usually do not die of acute disease, and caused death in 4- and 6-week-old A/J mice, but not in older mice. We conclude that interferon is an important host defense factor in the initial response of different strains of mice to MHV-3 infection. Other factors, however, such as the capacity of macrophages to restrict viral multiplication probably underlie the genetically determined susceptibility or resistance of mice to MHV-3 infection.
