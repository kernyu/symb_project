A total of 865 Salmonella isolates from wastewaters and sewage-contaminated natural waters were tested for antimicrobial resistance by using NR10 medium and incubation at 43 degrees C. Of the strains, 12.7% were resistant to one or more of the compounds tested, and 30% transferred resistance to an Escherichia coli recipient. The highest minimal inhibitory concentrations were ca. 1,000 micrograms/ml. Transfer frequencies ranged from 10(-3) to 10(-7).
