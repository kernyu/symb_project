During the period of June to October 1985, a study in vivo was made on 162 patients suffering from malaria by P. falciparum, in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the parasite to the drugs: Chloroquine, Amodiaquine and Pyrimethamine-Sulfadoxine (Fansidar). As an alternative treatment, in the resistant cases, Quinine with Fansidar or Quinine with Tetracycline was given. The following cases of resistance were found: 17 cases to Chloroquine (5-RI, 9-RII, 3-RIII), 7 cases to Amodiaquine (5-RI, 2-RII) and 2 cases to Fansidar (1-RI, 1-RII). It is recommended that the epidemiologic studies of the resistance by P. falciparum to the anti-malarials be increased, following up the evolution of its scope, and the organization of a program to fight against malaria. Also the use of Fansidar is recommended as the principal medicine against P. falciparum in malaria without complications, in the zones where there is strong resistance to the 4-amino-quinoleines. In case of multi-resistance in malaria by P. falciparum, the use of Quinine is recommended. At a prophylactic level we do not advise the use of Chloroquine as the only medicine, nor the use of Fansidar because of its potential toxic effects.
