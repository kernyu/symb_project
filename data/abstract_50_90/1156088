The pattern of ribosomal proteins in plastids of a nonmendelian streptomycin resistant mutant does not differ from that of wildtype cells when compared by two-dimensional gel-electrophoresis. The protein pattern of a mendelian resistance mutant is changes, however. Since the resistance in this mendelian mutant is probably caused by a change in the ribosomal proteins, the resistance in the nonmendelian mutant must be considered as a change of the ribosomal RNA.
