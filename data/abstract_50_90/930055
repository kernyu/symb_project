The effect of rifamycine on the infectivity and accumulation in tissues of potato X-virus (PXV) and tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) in local and systemic infections of plants was studied. High concentrations of rifamycine (50--100 microgram/ml) were found to inhibit and low (2 microgram/ml) to stimulate the infectivity of the viruses. Rifamycine reduced accumulation of PXV in isolated leaves of thornapple and growth of necrotic lesions caused by TMV on tobacco leaves. The effectiveness of the antibiotic depends on its concentration, method and time of its use and the kind of the experimental system. The activity of rifamycine towards the induced tobacco resistance to reinfection with TMV was found to be insignificant.
