The in vitro activity of cefazaflur, a parenteral cephalosporin, was determined against 590 clinical isolates. Cefazaflur inhibited the majority of gram-positive cocci at concentrations below 1 mug/ml except for enterococci. The agent was as active as cefamandole or cefoxitin against most Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis. Although it inhibited a number of strains of Enterobacter, indole-positive Proteus, and Serratia resistant to cephalothin, it was much less active against these organisms than were cefamandole or cefoxitin.
