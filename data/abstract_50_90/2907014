The incidence of cephaloridine resistance (minimum inhibitory concentration, MIC greater than 8 mg L-1) in isolates from urinary tract infections was 45.1% in Glasgow, 22.6% in Dundee and 25.9% in Edinburgh. The incidence of ampicillin resistance (MIC greater than 8 mg L-1) was even higher:- being 45.2% in Dundee and 48.5% in Edinburgh. In Glasgow, the incidence was 71.9% which is the highest proportion of ampicillin resistance reported in the United Kingdom. The cephaloridine resistant strains were examined for beta-lactamase production. Amongst these strains 50.8% produced only a chromosomal beta-lactamase, whereas 47.9% produced beta-lactamases which were potentially plasmid-mediated on the basis of biochemical tests. Only 1% of the resistant strains produced no detectable beta-lactamase.
