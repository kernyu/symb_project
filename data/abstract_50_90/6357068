Ceftazidime was administered intravenously or intramuscularly or both in doses of 1 to 6 g per day to 33 patients with serious gram-negative bacillary infections (12 pulmonary, 10 urinary tract, 4 soft tissue, 4 intraabdominal, and 3 miscellaneous infections). Twenty-one patients were septicemic. We identified 20 isolates of members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and 13 isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Seventeen patients had failed to respond to previous antimicrobial therapy. A total of 23 patients were clinically cured, 7 patients improved, and 3 patients failed to respond to therapy. The selection or emergence of resistant organisms during treatment (mostly Candida spp., Staphylococcus aureus, and enterococci) was noted in 11 patients. Toxicity was minimal (reversible mild liver function abnormalities and eosinophilia). The results of this study suggest that ceftazidime is an effective and well-tolerated new cephalosporin for the therapy of serious infections due to susceptible gram-negative organisms.
