Three clones have been prepared from the Honduras I/CDC strain of Plasmodium falciparum by a method of microscopic selection. One of these (HB-2) does not form gametocytes whereas the others (HB-1 and HB-3) do. All three are as resistant to pyrimethamine as the original line, and all three form knobs on the erythrocyte surface.
