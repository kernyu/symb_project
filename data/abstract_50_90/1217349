The authors describe a method of isolation of anaerobic streptococci from the blood. A high seeding efficiency of anaerobic streptococci from the depth of the tonsils (75.1%) and from their surface (59.7%) and also from the blood (36%) pointed to the leading role of these microbes in the etiopathogenesis of chronic tonsillitis. In healthy individuals anaerobic streptococci are revealed (by culture method) on the surface of the tonsils but rarely (6%). Str. micros are the most incident in chronic tonsillitis (in 85.3% of cases-from the depth of the tonsils and in 77.5%-from the surface), whereas Str. anaerobius and Str. intermedius occur in individual cases only (8.4-7.5% and 6.3-15%, respectively). Pure culture of Str. micros was found in 36% of cases. Pathogenetic scheme of development of bacteriemia in chronic tonsillitis and rheumatism is presented. The isolated cultures were found to be resistant to the widely-used antibiotics.
