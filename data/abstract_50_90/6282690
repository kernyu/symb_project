We have constructed three new subcloning plasmid vectors, pRC1, pRC2, and pRC3, derived from pKC7, which allow the rapid, single-step subcloning of yeast genes. Subcloning with these vectors utilizes a partial digestion with Sau3A to generate a quasi-random set of DNA fragments from the original plasmid. All three vectors contain a kanamycin resistance gene. Therefore, if the original cloned yeast DNA fragment is present in a vector that does not specify kanamycin resistance, the subclone pool can be propagated in Escherichia coli in the presence of kanamycin to select against parent plasmids that escaped restriction by Sau3A. Selection by complementation in yeast yields a collection of plasmids with smaller yeast DNA inserts containing the gene of interest. In the vectors pRC2 and pRC3, constructed from pRC1, the unique BamHI site is located within an intact tetracycline resistance gene, thus making it possible to screen bacterial transformants for those containing recombinant plasmid molecules. Vectors pRC2 and pRC3 also contain the yeast 2 micrometers DNA replication origin, and thus are more stable than plasmids carrying only the TRP1-associated replicator (ars1).
