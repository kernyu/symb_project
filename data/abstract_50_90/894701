Amphotericin B enhances Na+ conductance of the mucosal membrane of gallbladder epithelial cells and in such a way it modifies the brush border electromotive force. On this basis a method to measure cell and shunt resistances by comparing changes of the mucosal membrane potential (Vm) and of the transmural p.d. (Vms) is developed. This method is applied in gallbladders of different vertebrate species (i.e. rabbit, guinea pig, goose, tortoise, toad, trout). The two tested mammals, rabbit and guinea pig, exhibited a lower shunting percentage (89--93%) than the nonmammals (96--97%), but this fact did not bring about a homogeneous positive Vms. This means that shunting percent contributes, but it is not the only source of differences in Vms, in accordance with that reported by Gelarden and Rose (J. Membrane Biol. 19:37, 1974). Moreover, mammals exhibited a lower luminal resistance and a lower ratio between luminal and basolateral resistance than nonmammals. Possible causes of these differences are discussed.
