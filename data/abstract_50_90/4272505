One hundred and eighty-seven males with uncomplicated gonorrheal urethritis were treated with spectinomycin hydrochloride in a dosage of 2 g. given intramuscularly. A failure rate of 3.2% was observed and no complications of therapy were encountered. In addition, 310 strains of N. gonorrhoeae were tested for susceptibility to penicillin G and spectinomycin. All strains were sensitive to 20 mug./ml. of spectinomycin and this susceptibility appeared to decrease as penicillin resistance increased. A greater incidence of relative resistance to penicillin G was observed than in similar studies from other Canadian areas.
