A Swedish tourist who had visited Kenya fell ill with Plasmodium falciparum malaria 11 days after returning home, in spite of taking pyrimethamine (50 mg weekly) as malaria prophylaxis. Chloroquine treatment (25 mg base/kg body-weight) giving serum concentrations of 0.30 mumol/l cleared the patent parasitaemia and the patient recovered. Recrudescence occurred, however, within 42 days. A second chloroquine course (30 mg base/kg) gave serum levels up to 1.28 mumol/l. The patient improved rapidly and remained healthy during 28 days without renewed parasitaemia. Further follow-up for 10 months was uneventful. We consider it urgent to assess chloroquine concentrations in serum in patients being treated for falciparum malaria in order to obtain data on fully effective levels. Ineffective serum levels should be ruled out in cases not responding to chloroquine, especially when chloroquine-resistance is suspected.
