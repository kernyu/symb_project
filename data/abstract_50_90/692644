It was shown that ability of developing resistance to QAC by Moraxella ssp. is limited, while marine strains of Pseudomonas sp. are able to develop both homological and heterological resistance to Sterinol and Laurosept. Five months storage in medium without QAC caused partial loss of resistance of strains which previously gained resistance to this compound. None of the tested marine bacteria strains was able to get resistance against Chloramina T. Strains with developed resistance to Laurosept and Sterinol became more sensitive to Chloramina T. On the other hand, as a result of contact of the same bacteria with sublethal doses of Chloramina T increase of sensitivity to QAC was observed.
