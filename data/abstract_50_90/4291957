Mice receiving statolon intraperitoneally were 1,000 times more resistant to intraperitoneal challenge with mengovirus than were untreated controls. Protection was afforded when statolon was administered 1 day before or 1 day after intraperitoneal inoculation with the virus. No therapeutic effect was observed when treatment with statolon was delayed for 2 days or more after virus infection. Exposure of mice to a simulated space cabin environment did not increase their susceptibility to the lethal effects of mengovirus infection or eliminate the protective effect of statolon.
