The combination of penicillin and streptomycin did not act synergistically in vitro against three streptomycin-resistant strains (MIC, greater than or equal to 1,000 micrograms of streptomycin/ml) of penicillin-susceptible streptococci. Using a model of experimental infective endocarditis, we infected rabbits with a control streptomycin-susceptible strain, with an intermediately streptomycin-resistant strain (MIC, 1,000 micrograms/ml), and with a highly streptomycin-resistant strain (MIC, greater than 32,000 micrograms/ml). Treating animals with a combination of procaine penicillin and streptomycin was more effective (P less than .01) than treating them with procaine penicillin alone only for those animals infected with the control streptomycin-susceptible strain. Treatment with procaine penicillin plus gentamicin was more effective (P less than .01) than treatment with procaine penicillin alone for all three treatment groups and was more effective (P less than .01) than treatment with procaine penicillin and streptomycin for those animals infected with an intermediately or highly streptomycin-resistant strain of streptococci.
