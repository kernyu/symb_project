A new mutation has been described which confers resistance to catabolite repression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The mutant allele, termed grr-1 for glucose repression-resistant, is characterized by insensitivity to glucose repression for the cytoplasmic enzymes invertase, maltase, and galactokinase, as well as the mitochondrial enzyme cytochrome c oxidase. Hexokinase levels in grr-1 mutants are approximately 3-fold higher than the corresponding activity of the parental strain. Although the grr-1 allele is expressed phenotypically similarly to the hex-1 (hxk-2) and hex-2 mutations described by Entian et al. (1977) and Zimmermann and Scheel (1977) respectively, we have shown genetically and physiologically that grr-1 represents a new class of mutation.
