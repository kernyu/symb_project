Twenty-one patients with urinary tract infections due to Pseudomonas and coli-form bacilli were treated with 80-120 mg of tobramycin per day in two daily doses. Of these patients, 14 (67%) were cured, one improved, three (14%) showed no improvement, and three (14%) showed a substitution of the original pathogen by another organism. Urine cultures demonstrated rapid sterilization in the cases in which patients responsed well, and long-term sterility persisted in at least 50% of the subjects.
