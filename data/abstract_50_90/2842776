Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) manifests a range of phenotypes in culture that may be important in understanding its relationship to non-SCLCs and to tumor progression events in patients. Most SCLC-derived cell lines, termed "classic" SCLC lines, have properties similar to SCLC tumors in patients, including high expression of neuroendocrine markers and low c-myc oncogene expression. A significant number of SCLC lines characterized as "biochemical or morphologic variant" SCLC lines have decreased levels of endocrine differentiation markers associated with increased proliferative indices, amplification of the c-myc oncogene, and growth patterns and biochemical markers more typical of non-SCLCs. To delineate further the relationships between these phenotypes and the molecular events involved, we have inserted the v-Ha-ras gene in SCLC cell lines with (biochemical variant) and without (classic) an amplified c-myc gene. These two SCLC subtypes had markedly different phenotypic responses to similar levels of expression of v-Ha-ras RNA. No biochemical or morphologic changes were observed in classic SCLC cells. In contrast, in biochemical variant SCLC cells, v-Ha-ras expression induced features typical of large cell undifferentiated lung carcinoma, including adherent monolayer growth patterns, increased cloning efficiency, increased levels of non-SCLC cell markers, ultrastructural characteristics and an acquired resistance to polyamine depletion typical of large cell carcinoma, but not SCLC, in vitro. Expression of v-Ha-ras in biochemical variant SCLC cells directly demonstrates that important transitions can occur between phenotypes of human lung cancer cells and that these may play a critical role in tumor progression events in patients. The findings provide a model system to study molecular events involved in tumor progression steps within a series of related tumor types.
