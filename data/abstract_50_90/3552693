Oral single-dose therapy with fosfomycin-trometamol (F-T) was used in 18 patients with lower urinary tract infections. The isolated bacterial strains presented a minimum inhibitory concentration of greater than 128 micrograms/ml in vitro. In spite of this 'resistance' in vitro, a clinical and bacteriological cure was obtained in 12 cases (66%). There were relapses in 2 cases, and clinical and bacteriological failure in only 2 cases. These results are due to the high urinary levels and prolonged bactericidal activity of urine after single-dose therapy with 3-5 g F-T. The clinical and biological tolerance was very good.
