Liveweight gain, food intake, wool growth and concentration of serum constituents were measured in four groups of three-month-old lambs. Groups 1 and 2 were infected on five days each week with 2500 Trichostrongylus colubriformis larvae for 18 weeks. Group 2 lambs were treated with fenbendazole (5 mg kg-1) at week 10 and week 15. Group 3 lambs were similarly infected for 10 weeks, treated with fenbendazole, but given no further larvae. A fourth control group remained uninfected throughout the trial. All lambs were killed at week 20. Mean worm populations were 16,130, 430 and zero for groups 1, 2 and 3 respectively. Over the first 10 weeks of infection, liveweight gain was reduced by 52, 43 and 51 per cent and wool growth by 33, 28 and 27 per cent respectively, in groups 1, 2 and 3. Serum hypophosphataemia and hypoalbuminaemia occurred in all three infected groups. Between weeks 10 and 20 overall weight gain and wool growth in group 1 lambs were 44 and 46 per cent lower than the controls, whereas weight gains of group 2 and group 3 lambs were similar to or slightly higher than in the controls. However, wool growth in these two groups after treatment was only 73 to 74 per cent of control values. Serum phosphorus concentrations increased to control levels within one week of anthelmintic treatment and serum albumin concentrations by two to four weeks. The ability of group 2 lambs to improve their performance after anthelmintic treatment, in the face of continued challenge, was attributed to development of resistance to reinfection.
