The effect of several agents on 3H-colchicine, uptake by L cells and resistant to colcemide and colchicine L-53 cells was studied. Vinblastin to which L-53 cells are cross-resistant increases labeled colchicine uptake by L and L-53 cells 3- and 8-fold, respectively. The substances which decrease ATP level in the cells (olygomycin, etc.) enhance colchicine uptake by L and L-53 cells 2--4-fold. In the presence of these substances colchicine uptake by resistant cells is more intensive than by sensitive L cells. The structural analogue of colchicine, lumicolchicine, inactive in binding the microtubular protein tubulin enhances colchicine uptake by L and L-53 cells to about equal degree.
