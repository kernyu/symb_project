Six cephalosporins and three aminoglycosides were examined for activity against 1,693 isolates belonging to six species of Proteeae. The most notable species-specific differences included the marked susceptibility of Providencia alcalifaciens and Proteus mirabilis to cephalothin, the resistance of Proteus vulgaris to cefamandole, and the resistance of Providencia stuartii to gentamicin and tobramycin. The third-generation cephalosporins cefotaxime and moxalactam were substantially more inhibitory than were cefoperazone, cefamandole, and cefoxitin. P. stuartii, generally the most resistant species, was, however, markedly susceptible to moxalactam and cefotaxime.
