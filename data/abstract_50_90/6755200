During our work which covers a period of 9 consecutive years, in the laboratories of two pediatric hospitals in Ankara Salmonella strains isolated mostly came out multiple resistant S. typhimurium strains. Phage typing and plasmid characterization studies showed that the cause of this situation was due to the presence of a FIme group antibiotic resistance plasmid. S. typhimurium strains carrying the same plasmid was shown to be present in many Middle Eastern countries located near by Turkey. The clinical problem is the resistance of this bacteria, which cause the epidemic, against the conventional drugs such as Chloromycetin and ampicillin used for the treatment of Salmonellosis.
