A total of 52 strains of Prototheca zopfii were studied with a series of beta-lactam compounds in order to test possible existence of beta-lactamase capable of inactivating these compounds. The method used was based on the iodimetric technique. Results showed the existence of beta-lactamase which worked in different degrees depending on the beta-lactam compounds.
