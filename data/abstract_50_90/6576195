Treatment of a natural killer cell-resistant (NKR) DBA/2 lymphoma with L-cell interferon (IFN) enhanced its reactivity to serum natural antibody in vitro in cytolysis and absorption studies and increased the in vivo acquisition of natural and antitumor antibody in the peritoneal cavity. The IFN effects were both time- and dose-dependent. In vitro IFN-treated, [131I]5-iodo-2'-deoxyuridine-labeled tumor cells, when injected ip into normal syngeneic mice, were more rapidly eliminated than were untreated control cells. IFN treatment of the NKR tumor decreased "cold-target" inhibition of NK lysis and did not alter binding or lysis by macrophages. These findings indicated that the enhancement of natural resistance to the IFN-treated tumor did not involve NK cells or macrophages and suggested that IFN may enhance host antitumor resistance by increasing tumor reactivity to antibody.
