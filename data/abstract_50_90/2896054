The characteristics of excitatory amino acid-evoked currents and of excitatory synaptic events have been examined in lamprey Muller neurons using voltage clamp and current clamp recording techniques. Application of glutamate evoked depolarizations associated with a decrease in input resistance. The reversal potential of the responses was -35 mV. Under voltage clamp conditions, a series of excitatory amino acid agonists evoked inward currents associated with little or no increase in baseline current noise. The order of potency of the excitatory amino acid agonists was quisqualate greater than kainate greater than glutamate greater than aspartate, while N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) was inactive. Inward currents evoked by glutamate, as well as by kainate and quisqualate were attenuated reversibly by 1 mM kynurenic acid (KYN). In contrast, glutamate-evoked currents were not affected by 100 microM D(-)-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (APV), a selective NMDA antagonist. Spontaneously occurring and stimulus-evoked excitatory postsynaptic events were antagonized reversibly by 1 mM KYN. At this concentration, KYN had no effect on membrane potential, input resistance, or excitability of the cells. In contrast, excitatory postsynaptic currents were unaffected by APV. It is concluded that both glutamate responses and excitatory synaptic transmission in lamprey Muller neurons are mediated by non-NMDA-type receptors and that these receptors are associated with ionic channels with a low elementary conductance. The combined pharmacological and biophysical characteristics of these responses are therefore different from those previously reported in other preparations. Spontaneous (but not stimulus-evoked) inhibitory synaptic events in Muller neurons were blocked reversibly by 1 mM KYN but not by 100 microM APV, suggesting that excitation of interneurons inhibitory to Muller cells was also mediated by non-NMDA receptors.
