Following are the results obtained from studies made with cefoxitin in the field of pediatrics: (1) The peak serum level observed upon completion of the one hour drip infusion in a dose of 20-25 mg/kg of cefoxitin varied from 66.4 to 93.0 mcg/ml. This fell to a remarkably low level after 2 hours. The serum half-life varied from 18.84 to 27.86 minutes. (2) The cumulative quantity of cefoxitin excreted in the active form in the urine by the end of 6 hours after completion of the drip infusion was 92.9-93.8%. (3) All of the 42 patients with acute pediatric infection (such as various kinds of acute upper or lower respiratory tract infection, urinary tract infection were treated with either cefoxitin by a single shot (23 patients), or by drip infusion (19 patients). The dosage employed was approximately 50-100 mg/kg/day divided into two to three treatments. There was no major difference in the clinical efficacy between administering two times or three times, the efficacy rates being 96% and 89% respectively. The overall efficacy rate was 93%. (4) In either case of intravenous injections by either a single shot or drip infusion, excellent clinical responses were obtained in most patients. These people had a variety of infections, which were considered to be caused by various kinds of Gram-positive cocci, E. coli (including ABPC resistance), P. mirabilis, Kl. oxytoca and Haemophilus. (5) Out of the 42 patients who received cefoxitin in a daily dose of 5-100 mg/kg divided into two or three times either by a single shot or drip infusion, no hepatic or renal function abnormality was observed except for 2 cases of temporary eosinophilia. (6) On the basis of these results, cefoxitin was found to be a highly useful antibiotic in the treatment of acute pediatric infection caused by microorganisms which are sensitive to cefoxitin.
