Six isolates of Serratia marcescens were recovered sequentially from the respiratory tract of a single patient. The first three isolates were of the 'opaque' (wild-type) colony type and were susceptible to amikacin, cefotaxime, and lamoxactam. The following three isolates were of the small, 'gray' colony variety, significantly less susceptible to the three antibiotics, and revealed three altered outer membrane proteins, as determined with the SDS-PAGE procedure.
