Hospital infections are of a major and growing health concern worldwide. They are the cause of appreciable economic loss, but what raises the particular alarm, both ethically and as a public health problem, is their continuous trend towards increasing lethality. The incidence of nosocomial infections can be prevented by creating a system of barriers that would interrupt their spread and transmission. Apart from strict adherence to general hygiene rules and the rational employment of examination methods it is essential in this respect that a prime attention is paid to the sensible use of antimicrobials, i.e. the persuance of a sound antibiotic policy. Its integral components are the systematic laboratory control, continuous epidemiological surveillance of bacterial drug resistance patterns, study of variations in the biological properties of multiple resistant bacterial strains, and the development of, and adherence to, effective and indicated treatment schedules. The particular problems related to bacterial enzyme activities and the genetic information (plasmids) coding for resistance to antimicrobials, as well as the virulence and pathogenicity of agents responsible for the onset of hospital infection are also discussed in this context. It is pointed out that for an effective hospital infection control it is essential to avoid the onesided pressure of badly applied antibiotic therapy.
