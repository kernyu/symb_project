Two naturally occurring forms of gonococcal peptidoglycan (PG) were tested for their susceptibility to human PG hydrolases. Purified 3H-labeled PG substituted extensively with O-acetyl derivatives (O-PG; from Neisseria gonorrhoeae FA19) and 14C-labeled O-acetyl-deficient PG (non-O-PG; from N. gonorrhoeae RD5) were mixed together and treated with either normal human sera (NHS) or with lysozyme purified from human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN-LZ). The initial rate of hydrolysis of O-PG by NHS or by PMN-LZ was two- to fourfold less than that of its non-O-PG counterpart in the same tube. When the reactions were allowed to go to completion. NHS solubilized both PGs completely, whereas PMN-LZ solubilized all of the non-O-PG and left ca. 60% of the O-PG insoluble. The PMN-LZ-soluble fraction of O-PG consisted largely of glycosidically linked fragments with molecular weights greater than ca. 10(4), whereas the corresponding non-O-PG was degraded to lower-molecular-weight fragments, exclusively. At completion, NHS hydrolyzed both PGs to fragments whose size was equal to or smaller than that of the free disaccharide unit of PG, suggesting that human sera contain a peptide-splitting (amidase) activity and a glycosidase activity, in addition to that of the well-known muramidase. NHS also promoted the release of high-molecular-weight PG fragments from intact gonococci. The persistence of human hydrolase-resistant PG in the form of soluble macromolecular fragments may potentiate the biological effects of gonococcal PG in vivo.
