The effect of tetracycline and rifampicin on R. prowazekii, strain Breinl and R. sibirica, strain X1 was studied in the experiments with chick embryos exposed to the antibiotic mixture with the infection material. It was shown that tetracycline in doses of 0.1 and 1 mg/embryo had the rickettsiostatic and rickettsiocidic effects respectively on R. sibirica. Rifampicin had only the rickettsiostatic effect in a dose of 0.1 mg/embryo and no rickettsiocidic effect even in a dose of 2 mg/embryo. Higher doses were toxic for 100 per cent of the embryos. The rickettsiostatic and rickettsiocidic effects of tetracycline on R. prowazekii were evident in doses of 0.05 and 0.1 mg/embryo, respectively. Rifampicin in a dose of 0.05 mg/embryo had both the rickettsiostatic and the rickettsiocidic effects on R. prowazekii. Therefore, rifampicin was more active with respect to R. prowazekii and tetracycline was more active with respect to R. sibirica. In addition, R. sibirica was more resistant to both tetracycline and rifampicin as compared to R. prowazekii.
