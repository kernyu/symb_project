This paper deals with so-called "indicator germs" in the air of stables, such as Micrococci, E. coli and Pasteurella species. It is pointed out, that mostly the sources of these germs are the animals themselves. Studying the sources of airborne bacteria our working group found a close correlation between applicated antibiotics (Chloramphenicol) and the resistance of airborne bacteria against this antibiotic. Spreading models lead to the conclusion that about 250-500 m around a stable there is a region of higher contamination by dust and infectious risk is increased.
