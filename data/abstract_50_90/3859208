In an open, prospective, multicenter trial the efficacy and tolerance of imipenem/cilastatin for the treatment of bacterial pneumonia was investigated. Forty-three adults were studied: 29 with nosocomial and 14 with community-acquired infections. Significant underlying disease was present in 91 percent of patients. Nosocomial infection was frequently associated with endotracheal intubation (48 percent), prior antibiotic therapy (48 percent), and recent surgery (31 percent). Most frequent sputum isolates included Pseudomonas aeruginosa (10, all nosocomial), Hemophilus influenzae (10), Escherichia coli (eight), Staphylococcus aureus (seven), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (six). Treatment with imipenem/cilastatin was associated with clinical cure in 93 percent of patients. Two of three failures and one superinfection occurred in association with isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa resistant to imipenem. Overall, six of 10 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated prior to therapy developed resistance to imipenem after an average of 10 days of therapy. Adverse effects occurred in nine patients (21 percent) and included one case of pseudomembranous colitis. Monotherapy with imipenem/cilastatin of serious lower respiratory tract infections was relatively safe and highly effective with the exception of disease associated with P. aeruginosa.
