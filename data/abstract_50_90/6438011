In the present investigation many of the isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa from human beings, poultry and pigs fell in the same aeruginocine type. Aeruginocine A1 of Ps. aeruginosa was isolated from pigs and also from one of the pig attendants on the farm. Majority of the strains of Ps. aeruginosa of the same aeruginocine type also exhibited similar drug sensitivity patterns. The organism appeared to be polyphagous in nature and infection with this agent may be considered as amphixenosis.
