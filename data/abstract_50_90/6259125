It is well established that Pseudomonas aeruginosa cells grown in Mg2+-deficient medium acquire nonmutational resistance to the chelator ethylenediaminetetraacetate and to the cationic antibiotic polymyxin B; this type of resistance can be reversed by transferring the cells to Mg2+-sufficient medium for a few generations. Stable mutants resistant to polymyxin B were isolated and shown to have also gained ethylenediaminetetraacetate resistance. Both the mutants and strains grown on Mg2+-deficient medium had greatly enhanced levels of outer membrane protein H1 when compared with the wild-type strain or with revertants grown in Mg2+-sufficient medium. It was determined that in all strains and at all medium Mg2+ concentrations, the cell envelope Mg2+ concentration varied inversely with the amount of protein H1. In addition, the increase in protein H1 in the mutants was associated with an increase in resistance to another group of cationic antibiotics, the aminoglycosides, e.g., gentamicin. We propose that protein H1 acts by replacing Mg2+ at a site on the lipopolysaccharide which can otherwise be attacked by the cationic antibiotics or ethylenediaminetetraacetate.
