A total of 5.584 bacterial strains of different species from urine samples of various University clinics were isolated in 1983. These were tested with regard to their susceptability towards antibacterial substances. E. coli was the most common rod bacteria isolated, followed by Proteus species, Klebsiella und Pseudomonas. Staphylococci and Enterococci were found relatively frequently. A list was set up concerning the resistance pattern of the most important gram-negative rod bacteria toward four penicillin- and three cephalosporin derivatives as well as towards gentamicin and three chemotherapeutics in a stricter sense. For the first substance group mezlocillin supplied the best results. In the second group cefotaxime was most effective. More unfavorable on the whole were the results of the three chemotherapeutics. Enterococci were inhibited most by azlocillin, mezlocillin, ampicillin and nalidixic-acid. Cefsulodin as a special Pseudomonas cephalosporin showed strong activity towards this bacterial species.
