Two cases of oral candidiasis are described which failed to respond to nystatin therapy when used in combination with triamcinolone acetonide. The isolates of C. albicans obtained from the patients after treatment showed high in vitro resistance to nystatin when tested in combination with triamcinolone acetonide. Triamcinolone acetonide was detected in the saliva of both patients after treatment. Addition of this saliva to the isolates of C. albicans obtained after treatment was found to confer nystatin resistance. Both patients were treated with miconazole nitrate and a mycological and clinical cure was obtained in one of the cases.
