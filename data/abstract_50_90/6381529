Synergy between sulfamethoxazole (SMZ) and trimethoprim (TMP) was predicted by a two-plate agar dilution breakpoint MIC system. Comparison of the results of this new system with those of the disk diffusion system (P.M. Waterworth, Postgrad. Med. J. Suppl. 45:21-27, 1969) after tests with 1,518 Enterobacteriaceae isolates showed an overall correlation of 99.8%, a sensitivity of 99.7%, and a specificity of 100%. The method involves spot inoculation of 10(3) organisms onto each of two plates, one containing 160 micrograms of SMZ per ml and the other 8 micrograms of TMP per ml (in Oxoid IsoSensitest medium with 3% agar supplemented with 7% saponin-lysed horse blood), and then incubation overnight at 37 degrees C in air. All but three organisms for which SMZ-TMP was found to be synergistic by disk testing were inhibited on both plates. Three isolates of Proteus mirabilis, which failed to correlate with disk testing by this new system, all showed SMZ MICs of 1,000 micrograms/ml. The SMZ-TMP combination was falsely predicted to be nonsynergistic against these three organisms. There were no false synergy predictions by the breakpoint MIC system. Laboratories should report susceptibility to the SMZ-TMP combination only when there is synergy between the constituents. This simple, reliable agar dilution technique enables laboratories to accurately report synergy between SMZ and TMP.
