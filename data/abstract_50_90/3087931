The cidal activity of the antimicrobial agent, noxythiolin, was investigated against a laboratory strain and a fresh isolate of Candida albicans. The order of resistance to noxythiolin was hyphal form (isolate) greater than or equal to 25 degrees C-grown blastospores (isolate) greater than 37 degrees C-grown blastospores (isolate) greater than laboratory strain blastospores. Noxythiolin activity was superior to that of 'equivalent' formaldehyde concentrations. Mycelial transformation in C. albicans was examined by light and scanning electron microscopy and measured in terms of percentage germination and hyphal extension. Noxythiolin, 2.5%, in contact for 30 min prevented germination of the blastospore population whereas the decomposition products, formaldehyde and N-methylthiourea, showed no appreciable effect in the expected concentrations. The implications of these results are discussed in relation to the observed clinical efficacy of noxythiolin.
