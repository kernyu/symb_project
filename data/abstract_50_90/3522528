Timentin (ticarcillin + clavulanic acid) and cefamandole were compared in 484 patients undergoing elective thoracic or vascular surgery. Two hundred and forty eight patients received three 3 g/200 mg injections of Timentin and 236 patients received three 0.75 g injections of cefamandole. The patients were evaluated at discharge. Among the 248 patients given Timentin, only six (2.4%) had a post-operative infection, while nine (3.8%) of the 236 patients given cefamandole had a post-operative infection. There was no statistically significant difference between the two treatment regimes. This comparative study shows that Timentin may be used for antibiotic prophylaxis of clean vascular or thoracic surgery.
