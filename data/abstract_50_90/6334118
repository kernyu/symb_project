Invasive Haemophilus influenzae infections diagnosed in Cambridge between January 1975 and December 1981 are reviewed. Altogether, 81 sites in 77 patients were infected. Of these patients, 41 had meningitis, 20 epiglottitis, 8 bone or joint infections (2 with concurrent meningitis), 4 cellulitis, 5 pneumonia (2 with concurrent epiglottitis) and 3 septicaemia in the absence of documented localised infection. Most patients (88%) were children less than 5 years of age. Only 8 adults with such infections were identified. Of these, 6 had an identifiable predisposing condition. The incidence of meningitis was 18 cases per 100 000 children less than 5 years of age. There were 3 deaths. Of the strains of H. influenzae isolated, 16% were ampicillin-resistant. The unusual age-specific incidence of epiglottitis and the incidence of deafness after meningitis are emphasised.
