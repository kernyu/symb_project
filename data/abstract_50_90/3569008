The appearance in the faeces of resistant bacteria after oral treatment with Rifaximin, a new, non-absorbable rifamycin derivative, was investigated. To evaluate the degree of colonization of the intestinal tract by the Rifaximin-resistant strains, long-term bacteriological monitoring of the faeces of drug-treated volunteers was carried out. The data obtained showed that after suspension of treatment the resistant bacteria disappeared rapidly.
