A new DNA amplification is described from an isolate of the lizard parasite Leishmania tarentolae. This DNA is present in up to 50 copies in the Trager line of this species and present but not amplified in all other lines tested. This amplification has been named the T amplification (for Tarentolae/Trager). Restriction enzyme digestion and electrophoresis of total DNA reveal amplified fragments totalling 19 kb following staining with ethidium bromide, a finding confirmed by the use of specific hybridization probes. Much of the amplified T DNA occurs as extra-chromosomal circular molecules. No cross-hybridization was observed between the T region and other amplified DNA of Leishmania, or the maxicircle of L. tarentolae, nor was resistance to methotrexate, chloroquine or primaquine detected in the T-amplified line. Combined with our previous results showing H region amplification in 2 other unselected lab stocks, these data demonstrate the prevalence of apparently spontaneous gene amplifications in L. tarentolae.
