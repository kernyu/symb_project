800 samples of pharyngeal exudate were taken from healthy children and 28 healthy intrafamilial contacts of children with meningitis caused by H. influenzae type b. H. influenzae type be was isolated in 8.7 per cent of nursery children, H. influenzae type e in 0.12 per cent and non typifiable H. influenzae in 5.8 per cent. On intrafamilial contacts, 32 per cent had H. influenzae type b and non typifiable in 3.5 per cent. Percent age of ampicillin resistant H. influenzae type b was 14 per cent. No strains were found resistant to chloramphenicol. S. pneumoniae was isolated in 37 per cent of pharyngeal exudate samples. 25.5 per cent of strains tested were penicillin sensitive; 74.5 per cent has a decrease sensitivity. Based on these results we consider chloramphenicol to the the first drug of choice for treatment of severe H. influenzae infections and penicillin for S. pneumoniae infections recommending in the latter higher doses when dealing with central nervous system infections.
