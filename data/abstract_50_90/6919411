Forty isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus were tested for in vitro susceptibility to cephalothin, cefamandole, cefotaxime, and moxalactam, using the disk diffusion and microbroth dilution methods at incubation temperatures of 30 and 35 degrees C. Resistance to all four antibiotics was more clearly evident at an incubation temperature of 30 degrees C.
