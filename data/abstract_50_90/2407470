The in vitro susceptibilities of 703 clinical isolates of Salmonella to ciprofloxacin (CIP) and pefloxacin (PEF) were compared with those to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMZ), chloramphenicol (CO) and ampicillin (AP). All isolates were susceptible to CIP, while PEF inhibited 90.7% of the strains. In contrast, resistance rates of 40, 29.2 and 27% were detected for AP, TMP-SMZ and CO, respectively. PEF resistance was detected in S. panama (1), S. typhi (3) and S. typhimurium (17), the latter representing the most frequently serovar isolated in our country. None of the S. typhi isolates was resistant to CO. Combined resistance was most frequently found among S. typhimurium isolates, with the patterns PEF-TMP-SMZ-AP (10) and PEF-TMP-SMZ-CO-AP (5) predominating.
