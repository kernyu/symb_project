During the whole of 1983, all anaerobes cultured from clinical specimens were identified using both the Minitek system and gas chromatography. Antimicrobial susceptibility patterns were established using a broth microdilution test. The results show isolation rates for the individual species to be in good agreement with previous studies. Despite widespread use (even for prophylactic purposes), mezlocillin, latamoxef, cefoxitin, metronidazole and clindamycin retained their high activity against anaerobic bacteria and no clusters of resistance were observed. Augmentan also showed excellent in vitro activity. Penicillin was found to be inactive against most gram-negative anaerobic rods while tetracycline showed a rather high degree of resistance.
