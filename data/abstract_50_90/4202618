Cold-sensitive restriction of Pseudomonas phage CB3 by Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain PAT2 involves some aspect of CB3 specific RNA synthesis at 20 C. Experiments using chloramphenicol treatment and RNA-DNA hybridization establish that the amount of CB3 RNA present at 20 C is consistent with the known percentage of phage yielder cells at 20 C. Thus, it appears that nonyielder cells of PAT2 synthesize little or no phage-specific mRNA. Burgess technique extracted PAT2 RNA polymerase (RNAP) is cold sensitive when assayed in vitro with CB3 DNA at 20 C. However, it is not cold sensitive when either calf thymus or PAT2 DNA are the templates for transcription. Low ionic strength assay conditions eliminate the cold sensitivity of PAT2 RNAP. The effect of low ionic environments on transcription initiation along with the in vivo and in vitro suppression of cold sensitivity by host rifampin resistance suggests that the inability of CB3 to reproduce in PAT2 at 20 C is a cold-sensitive step in host RNAP initiation. Our modified RNAP extraction procedure for PAT2 and PAO1C also results in the recovery of cold-sensitive PAT2 RNAP with respect to CB3 DNA templates and points to basic enzymological differences between the two hosts. A model is presented for the unusual influence of temperature on the initiation process of both PAT2 and PAO1C on RNAP transcription.
