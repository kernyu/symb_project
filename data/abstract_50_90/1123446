Bacteriological details are given of a patient with chronic purulent bronchitis, who was being followed up during a survey of relapse in chronic bronchitis. A strain of Streptococcus pneumoniae, serotype 10, was isolated from the sputum over a period of six months, followed by a type 47A strain and later a type 28 strain. The patient was receiving prophylactic treatment with tetracycline throughout. The type 10 strain was sensitive to tetracycline in vitro by both the disc diffusion and doubling dilution sensitivity tests and mice infected with this strain were protected by tetracycline. In contrast, both the type 47A and type 28 strains were sensitive by the disc diffusion technique, but showed a low degree of tetracycline resistance by the doubling dilution method; mice infected with both these strains were not protected by tetracycline.
