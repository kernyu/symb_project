The induction of interferon by avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) and the sensitivity of IBV to interferon were studied. The results of experiments with ten IBV strains are summarized as follows. 1. All the IBV strains tested induced interferon in chick embryo (CE) cells, chicken kidney (CK) cells and embryonated eggs. The Iowa-609 strain induced about 1000 units of interferon in CE cells while the Beaudette-42 strain induced about 200 units of interferon in embryonated eggs; the interferon titers induced by other strains usually ranged from 5 to 60 units. No IBV strain induced interferon in HeLa or BHK-21 cells. 2. IBV particles inactivated by ultraviolet irradiation or by heating lost their ability to induce interferon. 3. The properties of the interferon produced in the present study are similar to those of other interferons produced in chicken cells. 4. HeLa or BHK-21 cells did not acquire resistance to virus infection, after incubation with interferon produced in CE cells. On the other hand, CK cells acquired the same degree of resistance to virus infection as CE cells after incubation with interferon produced in CE cells. 5. All the IBV strains tested were sensitive to interferon in CK cells. The sensitivities of Massachusetts-41 and Holte strains to interferon were similar to that of vesicular stomatitis virus.
