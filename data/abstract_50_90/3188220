Representatives of 200 urban and 200 rural households were interviewed to determine the extent and appropriateness of the use of chloroquine obtained over-the-counter for malaria prophylaxis. Malaria prophylaxis was taken by 38 urban and 65 rural respondents. Chloroquine was the only drug used and was found in 7 urban and 40 rural households. The presence of chloroquine was detected in 4/130 urban and 11/136 rural urine samples tested. Knowledge about chloroquine was unsatisfactory with 6 urban and 10 rural respondents aware that chloroquine could have harmful adverse effects. The doses of chloroquine taken for prophylaxis varied widely, and of the 103 respondents who took prophylaxis only 16% (urban) and 31% (rural) were taking the correct dose. Self-medication accounts for a substantial, little acknowledged, portion of chloroquine use. To limit appropriate use of a powerful, potentially dangerous antimalarial drug and perhaps extend the useful therapeutic life of chloroquine clear recommendations and population education are needed.
