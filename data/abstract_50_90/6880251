The lysogenic state of the methylotrophic strain Acetobacter MB 58/1 is completely demonstrated by curing and lysogenization experiments. During these investigations we found that some phenotypic characteristics are modified by the presence or loss of the prophage MO 1. It could be shown that changes of the serological behaviour, the adsorption of the phages and the sensitivity against oxytetracycline are caused by lysogenic conversion. The phenotypic alterations of the bacterial cells induced by the phage genome are the result of modifications of the lipopolysaccharide structures on the cell surface. In the case of oxytetracycline resistance, interactions between the modified lipopolysaccharide structures and specific transport proteins of the cell membranes must be assumed.
