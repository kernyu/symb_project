An in vivo test using the WHO protocol (chloroquine 25 mg/kg within 3 days, trial over 7 days) was performed in 72 children in the province of Zou, Benin, in July-August 1987. The blood concentration of chloroquine was dosed before, during and after treatment by a sensitive method. This study showed a low rate of drug resistance (4.2%), even though surveys in Cotonou exhibited a high level of chloroquine resistance.
