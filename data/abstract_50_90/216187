A non pathogenic variant of Clostridium perfringens and the wild type strain were characterized. The strains agreed in most of the biochemical properties, in susceptibility against antibiotics and in bacteriocin production. Contrary to the wild type the variant did not produce lecithinase and gelatinase. In deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) of both strains centrifuged in cesiumchlorid-ethidiumbromide equilibrium there was found a satellite peak containing three distinct, covalently closed circular (CCC) DNA elements. The sum of the average molecular weight or contour length of the two small circular molecules was equal to the average molecular weight or contour length of the third. The presence of the plasmids in the variant indicated that the synthesis of lecithinase might not be coded by a plasmid.
