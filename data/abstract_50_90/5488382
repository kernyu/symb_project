One hundred and sixty-three patients with bacteriuria in pregnancy were treated with a single dose of antibiotic. Four regimens were used: sulfadoxine (sulphormethoxine) 2 g., sulfametopyrazine 2 g., streptomycin 1 g., and a combination of sulfametopyrazine 2 g. and streptomycin 1 g. The highest cure rate of 77% was achieved with streptomycin and sulfametopyrazine. The long-acting sulphonamides alone gave a cure rate of 55% while streptomycin alone eradicated 43% of the infections. Despite the high cure rate with combined therapy bacterial resistance developed in some cases.
