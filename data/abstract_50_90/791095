A new cephalosporin is described that overcomes, in a novel way, the general susceptibility of this group of agents to enterobacterial beta-lactamases. The new compound carries a substituent that is released on cleavage of the beta-lactam ring and then exhibits antibacterial activity in its own right. The possible therapeutic benefits of such an antibiotic are discussed.
