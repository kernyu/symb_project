The eighth generation of adult Haemonchus contortus, selected by subjecting infected pairs of sheep to suboptimal ivermectin treatment once per generation from parent (P; BBH isolate) through F7 (IV-A; selected isolate), required an approximate 4-fold increase in the ivermectin dose to produce 95% efficacy compared with its contemporary parent isolate. In a dose titration experiment the dose-response curve of the drug pressure-derived isolate, IV-A, was significantly (0.02 less than P less than 0.05) less steep than was the response curve of the parent, BBH, isolate. Potency estimates based upon these nonparallel dose-response curves would not remain constant over a range of efficacy levels but would decrease rapidly at efficacies greater than 95%. Passage of a closed population of the F8 generation of IV-A sequentially through pairs of sheep for an additional 11 generations (F8A-F8K) without additional drug pressure being applied produced no reversion to sensitivity to ivermectin relative to the F7 generation, thus suggesting that the selected "resistance" was stable.
