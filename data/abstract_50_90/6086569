Clostridium perfringens 11268 CDR (Rifr Tcs), the strain transformed in our experiments, was generated by curing a spontaneous, rifampicin-resistant mutant of C. perfringens 11268 (Rifr Tcr). High-temperature growth yielded tetracycline-sensitive, rifampicin-resistant cells which no longer contained pCW3, a 42.8-kilobase plasmid. The tetracycline-sensitive, rod-shaped cell was then converted to an L-phase variant by growth in the presence of penicillin G (10 micrograms/ml) and 0.4 M sucrose. After several passages, the antibiotic was removed from the medium, and cells continued to grow as L-phase variants. Another large plasmid, pJU124 (38.8 kilobases), which confers tetracycline resistance, was used for transformation. Transformation of L-phase variants of C. perfringens 11268 CDR (Rifr Tcs) was mediated by polyethylene glycol. Transformation frequency is a nonlinear function of DNA concentration. Restriction analysis showed that the plasmid isolated from the transformants was identical to that supplied. Stable L-phase variants do not revert to rod-shaped cells, but autoplasts can be both transformed and reverted.
