It was shown in experiments on mice, rats and rabbits that resistance of animals in the state of acute radiation sickness to severe intoxication by aminoglycoside antibiotics, such as streptomycin, dihydrostreptomycin and monomycin did not significantly change. The exception was kanamycin the toxicity of which during the period of the acute state of radiation sickness increased by 30 per cent. The use of cystamine and merkamine before irradiation or their administration to non-irradiated animals resulted in lowering of the antibiotic tolerance by 1.5--2 times. The above aftereffects of the radioprotectors was observed within 3--12 days after their use and was most pronounced for the combination of cystamine and streptomycin. The acute toxicity of tetracyclines did not significantly differ at various stages of radiation disease and at the background of cystamine use. No significant cumulation of the toxicity of aminoglycoside antibiotics and tetracyclines or signs of adaptation in the healthy and irradiated animals was observed on prolong treatment with therapeutic doses. Cystamine had no effect on the tolerance of the antibiotics on their prolonged use.
