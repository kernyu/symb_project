Insertion sequence (IS) regions have been identified previously as a cause of strongly polar mutations in Escherichia coli and several bacteriophages. The present experiments indicate that genetically characterized IS regions occur on bacterial plasmid deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) as both direct and inverted DNA sequence duplications. The DNA insertion which has been shown previously (Sharp et al., 1973) to control expression of tetracycline resistance in the R6-5 plasmid, and which occurs as directly and inversely repeated DNA sequences adjacent to the region believed to contain the tetracycline resistance gene, has been identified as IS3. A second genetically characterized insertion sequence (IS1) has been identified as a direct DNA duplication occurring at both junctions of the resistance transfer factor and R-determinant components of R6-5 and related plasmids. A model is presented for the reversible dissociation of resistance transfer factor and R-determinant components of co-integrate R plasmids at the sites of DNA sequence homology provided by the repeated IS regions.
