For 15 months the anticoccidial effect of 200 ppm clopidol/methyl benzoquate and of 50 ppm robenidine, and the development of immunity against five different species of Eimeria were followed in a closed rabbit population. In unmedicated rabbits, oocyst output decreased progressively with increasing age to a very low level in animals older than four months, but none of the species present disappeared completely in adult animals. No clinical symptoms nor mortality from coccidiosis was noted in reproduction stock. In field conditions E magna and E perforans seemed to induce the weakest resistance, whereas a more marked resistance has been found for E intestinalis and E irresidua. E media appeared to have an intermediate position. Robenidine reduced oocyst output of E magna, E intestinalis, E irresidua, E media and E perforans significantly, whereas clopidol/methyl benzoquate reduced oocyst output of the latter four species only and was least active against E magna. Both drugs also reduced coccidiosis-induced mortality significantly. Medication only before weaning had no distinct influence on coccidial infection, or on mortality by coccidiosis after weaning; nor did those parameters differ significantly between continuously medicated rabbits and rabbits medicated after weaning only. As reproductive stock is protected by immunity, this makes the necessity of medicating does and bucks with anticoccidials questionable in intensive or semi-intensive reproduction systems.
