Aldrich, K. M. (The University of Kansas, Lawrence), and C. P. Sword. Methicillin-induced lysozyme-sensitive forms of staphylococci. J. Bacteriol. 87:690-695. 1964.-Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis grown in the presence of sublethal amounts of methicillin were converted to enlarged spheres within 2 to 4 hr, as shown by phase microscopy, Gram stain, and electron microscopy. Addition of lysozyme to cells incubated in the presence of methicillin, and to methicillin-induced spheres suspended in hypotonic saline, caused lysis of methicillin-treated cells but not of untreated cells.
