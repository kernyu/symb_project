Penicillin sensitivity of gonococci isolated from patients with relapses and reinfection of gonorrhea was studied. The results of the study were compared with those of the sensitivity tests in primary patients. The gonococcal strains with decreased sensitivity to penicillin were isolated from 82 per cent of the gonorrhea relapses, 47.8 per cent of the patients with reinfection and 33.2 per cent of the primary patients. The average sensitivity of the gonococcal strains isolated from the patients with relapses was 0.404 U/ml, while that in the primary patients and the patients with reinfection was 0.136 U/ml. Strains sensitive to 0.6--1.2 U/ml predominated among gonococci with decreased sensitivity in the patients with relapses, while in the primary patients and the ones with reinfection the value amounted to 0.1--0.2 U/ml. The penicillin sensitivity of gonococci may be used as a parameter in differential diagnosis of relapses and reinfection of gonorrhea.
