Synthetic 2-stranded RNA-a helical complex formed by duplexing homopolymers of polyriboinosinic and polyribocytidylic acids (poly I:C)-induced host resistance to foot-and-mouth disease virus when microgram quantities were injected into mice. There was a graded response as shown by titrations of polynucleotide complex or virus. Protection was effective for >48 hours after a single injection of polynucleotide complex. Survival and serum interferon titers were directly related.
