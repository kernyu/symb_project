One hundred and twelve penicillinase producing Neisseria gonorrhoeae (PPNG) isolates and the same number of non-PPNG isolates were obtained from patients attending the genitourinary department of this hospital. Susceptibilities to six beta lactam antibiotics--ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, cefuroxime, ceftazidime, amoxycillin, and temocillin--to the combined formulation of amoxycillin and clavulanic acid, Augmentin, and to the aminocyclitol, spectinomycin, were compared by assessing their minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs). Results showed that all the cephalosporins used in this study had good in vitro activity against both PPNG and non-PPNG strains, and ceftriaxone had the lowest MICs. Temocillin and Augmentin also showed good activity against both types of strain. Spectinomycin resistance was shown in about 4% of the PPNG isolates but was not found in any non-PPNG strains.
