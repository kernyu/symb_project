A Swedish farmer's wife aged 46 developed a unilateral panophthalmitis 6 weeks after a visit to Gambia in Africa. Vitreous puncture revealed growth of Staphylococcus aureus, but in spite of adequate treatment the eye had to be enucleated 5 weeks after the onset of symptoms. Gram-positive microorganisms in botryomycosis-like granules in the vitreal abscesses were at first suspected to be Histoplasma capsulatum. Electron microscopic examination revealed microorganisms, consistent with staphylococci. There was extensive proliferation of mesosomes, most probably due to the intense treatment. The poor nutrition and slow resorption of the dead microorganisms from the avascular vitreous did possibly also play a part in the proliferation of the mesosomes.
