The recipient capacity of the strains of Staph. epidermidis and Staph. areus belonging to different phage groups, as well as the possibility of epidemic distribution of the erythromycin resistance marker among the clinical staphyloccal strains on using the defective phage obtained from strain 8325 P IIde was studied. The defective phage P IIde may be the source of epidemic distribution of the drug resistance among the competent strains of Staph. aureus. All erythromycin sensitive strains of Staph. aureus lysed by the phages of groups I and III proved to be competent recipients of the erythromycin resistance marker. The strains of Staph. aureus of phage group II and phage type 80/81, as well as the strains of Staph. epidermidis were not competent recipients under our experimental conditions. It was not possible to transfer the high level of erythromycin resistance (1000 gamma/ml) on transduction to the strains of phage group I with a relatively low level of resistance to this antibiotic (20-50 gamma/ml.
