Spectinomycin-resistant (Spcr) mutants of Escherichia coli were isolated from nutrient agar plates containing 20% sucrose and 100 mug of spectinomycin per ml. About one-third of the Spcr mutants thus obtained were sucrose dependent (Sucd) and were classified into two types: I, those unable to grow on sucrose-free medium in the presence of spectinomycin; and II, those unable to grow on sucrose-free medium irrespective of the presence of spectinomycin. Most of these mutants were hypersensitive to antibiotics, dyes, and detergents and were abnormal in cell morphology, suggesting changes in cell envelopes. Reversion experiments indicated that the sucrose-dependent spectinomycin resistance and hypersensitivity to various chemicals were not independently induced properties. The Sucd-Spcr mutations of type I mutants were transducible by phage P1 and were mapped at the strA-aroE region.
