We conducted an in vitro susceptibility study of bacterial pathogens to various antimicrobials. Strains of Shigella, Salmonella, Escherichia coli, and Klebsiella pneumoniae collected in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s at the Hospital Infantil de Mexico Federico Gomez were tested against ampicillin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, amikacin, gentamicin, and furazolidone. Over the 3-decade period, the resistance of enteropathogens to furazolidone showed the least overall increase. Klebsiella susceptibility to the aminoglycosides decreased during the same period. Worldwide reports of enteropathogenic resistance to antimicrobials are also reviewed. In comparing the results of these worldwide studies with our own, we conclude that there is a need for periodic surveillance and testing of bacterial resistance to antimicrobials.
