In this paper a method which allows the measure of microbial death rate during spray-drying by means of a streptomycin-resistant mutant that can be grown on a streptomycin-containing agar is described. Plate counts of Microbacterium lacticum, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus recovered from skim milk powders were done on plate count agar in the presence and absence of streptomycin and on various selective media. The powders were produced from evaporated milk previously inoculated with those organisms. Our results showed that the proposed method allows the recovery of 78% of M. lacticum, 61% of E. coli, and 100% of S. aureus that survived spray-drying. Recoveries of surviving E. coli on violet bile agar and brilliant green bile 2% were 34% and 29% respectively. Baird-Parker and mannitol salt agar media allow the recovery of all surviving S. aureus, thus showing that S. aureus cells did not lose their ability to grow in media containig 7.5% NaCl. Our results show that physiological injury of the cells during spray-drying differs from injury due to heating only.
