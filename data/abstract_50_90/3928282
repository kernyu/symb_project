In vitro activity of nine new cephalosporins and penicillins was determined against 417 isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Carbenicillin, ticarcillin, gentamicin, tobramycin and netilmicin were also included in the study. Imipenem showed highest activity. More than 90% of the isolates were susceptible to ticarcillin, piperacillin, azlocillin, cefoperazone, cefsulodin and to tobramycin. 57 isolates included in the study were resistant to gentamicin (MIC greater than 4 mg/l); of these, none were resistant to imipenem, and more than 80% were susceptible to piperacillin, azlocillin, cefoperazone and cefsulodin.
