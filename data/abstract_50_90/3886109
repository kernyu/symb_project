Fourteen strains of Escherichia coli of serogroups characteristic of porcine class 2 enterotoxigenic E. coli isolated from pigs or calves were selected for genetic studies. The strains were examined for their ability to cotransfer a number of plasmid-mediated properties during conjugation with E. coli K-12. These properties were antibiotic resistance, and the production of heat-stable enterotoxin, the K99 antigen and colicin and the ability to ferment raffinose. Distinction was made between the two types of heat-stable enterotoxin, STa and STb. All 14 strains were antibiotic resistant and 11 of them cotransferred antibiotic resistance and heat-stable enterotoxin. One strain which transferred heat-stable enterotoxin also transferred the raffinose gene. Among six K99-positive strains which transferred heat-stable enterotoxin, five always cotransferred K99. Three strains had 100% cotransfer of colicin as well as heat-stable enterotoxin and K99. Drug resistance determinants were cotransferred at high frequency with heat-stable enterotoxin for six of eight multiple drug resistant enterotoxigenic E. coli. A 100% cotransfer of combinations of heat-stable enterotoxin, K99, colicin and antibiotic resistance was often associated with a single plasmid band on agarose gel electrophoresis. For some strains, the genes for STa and STb were on the same plasmid and for others they were on separate plasmids. The enterotoxin plasmids ranged in size from 5.2 to 85 Mdal. Heterogeneity in molecular size occurred among enterotoxin plasmids in E. coli of the same serogroup and recovered from the same animal host species.
