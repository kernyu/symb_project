The resistance level of Haemonchus contortus was studied on a farm where benzimidazole resistance had been detected in 1980 and where, since 1982, only levamisole had been used for worm control. Egg development tests gave LD50 values of 0.18, 0.19 and 0.21 microgram ml-1 thiabendazole for samples taken from ewes in 1988 compared with 0.21 microgram ml-1 in 1981. Studies on sheep experimentally infected with larvae cultured from the faeces of these ewes confirmed the continued resistance of H contortus to benzimidazoles, and demonstrated the absence of benzimidazole resistance in other nematode species together with the susceptibility of all species to levamisole.
