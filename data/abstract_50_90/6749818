Mitotic segregation of oligomycin resistance and oligomycin sensitivity was observed among the prototrophic progeny of protoplast fusion between drug-resistant and drug-sensitive complementary auxotrophs of Saccharomycopsis lipolytica. The transfer of oligomycin resistance by protoplast fusion without karyogamy suggests a cytoplasmic inheritance of this drug resistance determinant.
