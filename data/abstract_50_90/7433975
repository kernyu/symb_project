Trimethoprim in a concentration of 4 micrograms per milliter of Bacto-Casitone (Difco) medium inhibits the growth of nonvirulent Naegleria fowleri isolates. The growth of virulent strains is unaffected even with 400 micrograms of the drug per milliliter of medium. Differences in sensitivity constitute the possibility of a simple selection of environmental isolates. The pathogenicity and virulence of Naegleria species may be connected with the metabolism of folic acid.
