Host-mediated antiviral effect of 2 biological response modifiers (BRM), OK-432, and PS-K, against murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) was evaluated in chronically or latently infected mice. In the early stage of chronic MCMV infection, the BRM-induced resistance was evidenced by decrease in infectious viruses replicated in the salivary glands and by augmented cytotoxic activity of the spleen cells against YAC-1 cells and MCMV-infected mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF). In the late stage of chronic MCMV infection, the BRM treatment did not eliminate MCMV from the mice, but did prevent exacerbation of MCMV infection in the salivary glands induced by administration of cyclophosphamide (CY). In mice latently infected by MCMV, BRM treatment suppressed CY-induced reactivation of MCMV in the salivary glands. It was suggested that the antiviral effect of BRM against MCMV in chronically or latently infected mice was based on activation of natural killer (NK) cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL).
