In the study of 255 V. cholerae strains unrelated to vibrio O group I (NAG vibrios), which were isolated from water bodies in the region of the Volga delta in 1977-1982, antibioticograms of 17 types were obtained and R factor was detected in 37.7% of the strains under study. The pronounced heterogeneity of NAG vibrio populations, evaluated in minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values with respect to different antibiotics, is specifically manifested by the presence of various dominating subpopulations of these microorganisms, depending on their sensitivity to some chemical drugs. Various representatives of the genus Vibrio were used as a model for demonstrating the ability of the microbial population to enhance its variability as regards MIC values with a seasonal rise in the number of microorganisms.
