26 of 32 patients with multiple myeloma (MM) were successfully tested in vitro for human leucocyte interferon (IFN) sensitivity by use of the human tumour stem cell assay (HTCA) and/or 3H-thymidine incorporation (LI). Altogether, 12 patients were sensitive to IFN in vitro and 14 were resistant. All patients received treatment with leucocyte IFN. 8 patients were classified as responders, 3 as partial responders and 15 as non-responders. Correlating the in vitro/in vivo results, we found that the in vitro tests of the myeloma cells reflected a true sensitivity in 9 patients (75%) and a true resistance in 12 patients (86%). Furthermore, stimulation by IFN was found in 9 in vitro tests, of which 8 were obtained from non-responsive patients. Our results show that in vitro testing for IFN sensitivity is of clinical importance in predicting response to IFN treatment. Also, a stimulating effect by IFN in vitro will imply an unfavourable response in vivo.
