Methanol stimulates the hydrolysis of GTP catalyzed by bacterial ribosomes in the presence of the chain elongation factor T (EF-T). The methanol-stimulated activity is uncoupled from aminoacyl-tRNA binding to the ribosomes and does not require the presence of either synthetic polynucleotide messenger or aminoacyl-tRNA. When these reactants are present, along with EF-T, GTP, and methanol, the ribosomal binding of aminoacyl-tRNA is inhibited by thiostrepton but the uncoupled, EF-T-dependent hydrolysis of GTP is resistant to the antibiotic.
