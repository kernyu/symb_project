The use of erythromycin in Sweden has increased since 1975. An increasing prevalence of Haemophilus influenzae (H.i.) with reduced susceptibility to erythromycin has been noted in our laboratory during the years 1980 to 1985. The largest consumers of erythromycin were found to be children less than 4 years of age. Variations in resistance level of H.i. isolated from patients within this age group and variations in consumption of erythromycin were analysed for each year. The highest prevalence of resistant strains was found during spring and summer. The consumption of the antibiotic was highest during the first quarter of the year, gradually decreasing, and increasing sharply again during the fourth quarter of the year. Judging also from deviations from this pattern there seems to be an association between consumption and resistance. The different levels of resistance reported in the literature may reflect different populations of patients with different consumption of erythromycin, and different levels at different time of the year. Considering the present high level of H.i. with decreased susceptibility to erythromycin the drug is not likely to have clinical effect in H.i. infections.
