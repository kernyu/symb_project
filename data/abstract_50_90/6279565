The tetracycline resistance regulatory gene (tetR) of transposon Tn10 was analyzed by a combination of methods involving gene fusion and cloning. This gene is located on a 695-base pair HincII DNA fragment near the center of Tn10. The direction of transcription is opposite to that of neighboring gene tetA, which encodes the TetA protein. The gene product of the tetR gene (the TetR protein) has a molecular weight of 23,000. tet-R-lacZ gene fusions encode fusion beta-galactosidases that are membrane bound, indicating that the TetR protein itself is membrane associated. Mutants defective in tetR result in constitutive tetracycline resistance, but the level of resistance is reduced. Expression of the tetR gene is induced by tetracycline; in the absence of tetracycline, the TetR protein turns off its own synthesis.
