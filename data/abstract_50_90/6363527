Resistance of faecal Escherichia coli to ampicillin, tetracycline, sulphamethoxazole and gentamicin was studied in patients admitted to seven different departments in two hospitals. The resistance of ampicillin, tetracycline and sulphamethoxazole in the seven patient groups was 27-57%, 26-56% and 35-63%, respectively. Resistance to gentamicin was found in only one department. An E. coli flora predominantly resistant to ampicillin, tetracycline or sulphamethoxazole (greater than 50% of the E. coli strains in a faecal sample resistant) was found in 10-38%, 4-30% and 21-35% of the samples. A cross-sectional study focusing on the influence of the use of antimicrobial agents on the occurrence of resistant strains revealed a positive correlation between the annual turnover of broad-spectrum penicillins in various departments and the occurrence of predominantly ampicillin-resistant E. coli strains in these departments.
