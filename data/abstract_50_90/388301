Staphylococcus aureus methicillin resistants strains cultivated on subinhibiting methicillin concentrations are not modified as concern protein A and type antigen 18. Low protein A production of these resistant strains known to be heterogenous as concern their resistance to methicillin does not correspond to absence of protein A on the highly resistant fraction of the population.
