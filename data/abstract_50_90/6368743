We have isolated a strain of Escherichia coli from chicken caeca which produces two E colicins and colicin M. This strain has seven plasmids, five of which have been transferred to E. coli K12. Two E. coli K12 derivatives which produce the two E colicins separately have been tested against seven standard E colicin producing strains which define seven different immunity groups. Our results indicate that these new E colicins define two further immunity groups, E8 and E9.
