Antibiotic-resistance genes were shotgun cloned from antibiotic-producing Streptomyces sp. using pock-forming plasmids (pSF689 and pSF765), as cloning vectors. Streptomyces chartreusis SF1623 and S. lividans 66 were used as host strains. The ribostamycin (RSM) resistance gene was cloned from S. ribosidificus SF733 DNA (on a 2.3 Md PstI fragment) into both S. chartreusis SF1623 and S. lividans 66, using pSF689 as vector. Kanamycin (KM), novobiocin (NB), destomycin (DM) and racemomycin (RM) resistance genes were cloned from S. kanamyceticus M1164, S. spheroides M1469, S. rimofaciens M1470 and S. lavendulae A249 genomic DNA into S. lividans 66, using pSF765 as vector. Furthermore two types of KM resistance determinants derived from S. kanamyceticus M1164 were cloned using S. lividans 66, the pSF689 vector. The RSM resistance gene showed no homology to plasmid pSF733 of S. ribosidificus SF733, but hybridized to PstI or BclI digested total DNA of S. ribosidificus SF733.
