Antimicrobial susceptibilities were determined for 845 clinical isolates by the standardized Bauer-Kirby disk diffusion method and the automated Abbott Ms-2 system. There was an overall correlation of 90% between the two methods. The Abbott MS-2 susceptibility instrument offers a rapid and accurate method for the antimicrobial susceptibility testing of bacteria.
