As demonstrated by microbiological assays, a decrease in the active minocycline level occurs in spent media from each Escherichia coli K12 recipient containing one of 10 different plasmids bearing tetB determinants. No such decrease was detected when tetA, C, D or E determinants were tested under the same conditions. Likewise, no decrease in tetracycline or doxycycline levels was detected when 20 plasmids bearing tetA to E determinants were tested. Studies carried out by nuclear magnetic resonance and high pressure liquid chromatography proved that minocycline is broken by a mechanism mediated by the tetB determinant. This new mechanism can be considered as additional to the active efflux of minocycline.
