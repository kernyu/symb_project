MICs, the frequency of clinical and statistic resistance and the antiseptic activity index were studied in complex on out-of-hospital and hospital ecovars of P. aeruginosa. The forms resistant to a number of antiseptics, i.e. chloramine B, chlorhexidine, decamethoxine and dioxidine whose frequency eventually increased were shown to be widely distributed. The antiseptic sensitivity spectrum was more narrow and more heterogeneous than that of other bacteria, the heterogeneity level being dependent on the antiseptic type and bacterial ecovar. The activity of pervomur, phenol, resorcin and boric acid was higher against the clinical strains of P. aeruginosa while iodopyrin, sulfacetamide sodium and dioxidine were less active. The P. aeruginosa strains had natural resistance to cetylpyridinium chloride, rokkal, ethonium, sodium laurate and laurylsulfate and rivanol. It was recommended to assay antiseptic sensitivity of agents causing purulent inflammatory infections and to control circulation of antiseptic resistant variants of bacteria in hospitals.
