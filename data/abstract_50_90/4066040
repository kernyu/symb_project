Significant resistance against influenza virus and Mycobacterium tuberculosis infections was induced when trehalose dimycolate from M. tuberculosis or M. bovis but not M. avium was combined with muramyl dipeptide. Trehalose dimycolate from M. tuberculosis, in contrast to that from M. avium, could confer resistance against Toxoplasma gondii infections.
