Experiments were conducted on rats; it was shown that insulin, adrenaline, hydrocortisone, somatotropin, estradioldipropionate, deoxycorticosteroneacetate caused a rise of the membrane potential of individual muscle fibers, hepatocytes, motor neurons of the spinal cord, critical depolarization threshold, membrane resistance, shifts, in the K+, Na+ content. Simultaneously with these changes of the electrical properties of the membrane there occurred a rise of the RNA fraction synthesis, transcribing capacity of chromatin. Inhibitors of protein biosynthesis (actinomycin D, olivomycin, X-irradiation) prevented the hyperpolarization development and activation of genetic apparatus, whereas energy metabolsim inhibitors (sodium fluoride, monoiodine acetate, 2,4-dinitrophenol) failed to influence the rise of the membrane potential caused by hormones. Shifts in the electrical properties of cell membranes caused by hormones are connected with the genetic apparatus activation.
