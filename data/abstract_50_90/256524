The antibacterial activities of three aminopenicillins ampicillin, epicillin and amoxycillin were compared in vitro and in vivo. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of the three penicillins were very similar and the compounds were active against non-beta-lactamase-producing strains of Escherichia coli, Salmonella and Shigella species, Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Streptococci including Streptococcus faecalis, and non-beta-lactamase-producing staphylococci were also sensitive to the compounds but Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella aerogenes, Enterobacter and indole-positive Proteus species were resistant. At concentrations close to MIC value epicillin and ampicillin showed similar bactericidal activity against E. coli and against S. typhi and both compounds caused a slower rate of kill than was seen with amoxycillin. Microscopical observation of the cells exposed to ampicillin and epicillin for 1 h showed the presence of filamentous forms which lysed slowly, whereas cells exposed to amoxycillin for the same period rapidly. Epicillin was similar to or slightly less active than ampicillin against experimental mouse infections, and against the majority of infections both compounds were significantly less effective than amoxycillin by the oral and subcutaneous routes of administration.
