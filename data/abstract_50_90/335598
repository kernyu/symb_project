Chemical agents in subtoxic concentrations prolongate the survival time of living muscles and the time of contractile ability of glycerinated muscles. They preserve also the native property of actomyosine over the control time. The increase of resistance of living muscles and their models may be explained by stabilization of proteins or of their complexes. It is accompanied by the change of the indices of the functional state of the living muscle--by the decrease of the binding of vital dyes, by the hyperpolarization, by reducing the consumption of O2 and by the conservation of the quantity of SH groups at the high level.
