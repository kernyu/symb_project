KMR plasmids controlling antibiotic resistance and the capacity for production of the colonization antigen were identified in wild strains of E. coli (026, 0126, 0124) and S. sonnei isolated from patients with acute intestinal diseases. The strains of E. coli 026 and E. coli 0126 carried p KMR207-1 plasmid determining resistance to chloramphenicol and tetracycline and the adhesive properties. The molecular weight of the plasmid is 98 mD. The strain of S. sonnei carried p KMR 208-1 plasmid responsible for resistance to streptomycin, chloramphenicol and tetracycline and the adhesive properties. The molecular weight of this plasmid is 98 mD. The resistance to streptomycin and tetracycline and the capacity for the synthesis of the colonization antigen in E. coli 0214 was controlled by p KMR209 plasmid with the molecular weight of 2.66 mD. The restriction analysis suggests that p KMR207a-1 and p KMR 207b-1 plasmids detected in E. coli of different serotypes were identical, since they could be broken with BamH1 endonuclease into equal numbers of fragments similar by their molecular weights. p KMR207-1 and p KMR208-1 plasmids differed in their sensitivity to BamH-1 endonuclease. However, they were broken into 6 fragments similar by their molecular weights. p KMR207-1 and p KMR208-1 plasmids are probably closely related but not identical.
