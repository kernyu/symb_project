Sensitivity to actinomycin D(AD) varies in Pseudomonas fluorescens cells grown in glucose or succinate minimal salts medium. Growth is inhibited in succinate minimal medium by much lower concentrations of AD than in glucose minimal medium. Uptake of selected radioactive metabolites is inhibited by AD in cells incubated for 2 h in succinate medium containing AD but glucose-grown cells were not sensitive. EDTA treatment promotes increased sensitivity to AD in succinate-grown cells but does not alter sensitivity in glucose-grown cells. Succinate-grown cells bound 2-3 times as much 3H-AD as glucose-grown cells. Glucose-grown cells had much higher lipopolysaccharide levels in the envelope than succinate-grown cells. It is proposed that the lipopolysaccharide masks the binding sites and, therefore, is responsible for the difference in binding of AD by the glucose- and succinate-grown cells. The availability of the binding sites is also reflected in the sensitivity of the cells to the antibiotic.
