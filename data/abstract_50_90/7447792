The association between nutrient deficiencies, steroid administration, anti-flagellate therapy and giardiasis was examined using the Giardia muris/mouse model. Administration of steroids to BALB/c mice resulted in persisting high levels of infection with G. muris, whereas untreated animals were able to eliminate this parasite. In addition, steroid treatment significantly reduced the efficacy of anti-flagellate therapy. Protein-deficient mice eliminated the parasite at the same rate as mice on an optimum diet and also developed strong acquired resistance to re-infection. A similar pattern was observed in iron-deficient mice, except that the number of parasites that became established during the first 2 weeks of infection was significantly reduced. Thus, there was no evidence of synergism between iron and protein deficiency and infection in this model.
