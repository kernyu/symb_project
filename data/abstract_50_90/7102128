Vessels implants as possible vessel connections for chronic haemodialysis have to meet certain requirements concerning resistance to cutting and kinking and ability to be sewn under tolerable intraoperative damage risk. Preservation in peroxyethanic acid significant reduces the mechanical resistance of the biological primary material; by contrast, preservation in methanal clearly raises the mechanical stability of the preparations.
