A randomized trial to compare the efficacy and safety of 1 g of ceftriaxone daily and 3 to 4 g of cefazolin daily was conducted in 84 hospitalized adults with skin and soft tissue infections. A variety of infections including bacteriologically proven cellulitis, suppurative diabetic foot ulcer, soft tissue abscess, and other miscellaneous infections were treated. Side effects were minimal. Colonization with various microorganisms was observed during therapy with both agents. Clinical cure with or without surgery was achieved in 81 percent (34) of 42 patients treated with ceftriaxone and 77 percent (32) of 42 patients treated with cefazolin. The major difference between antibiotics was the rate of failure in infections caused by multiple organisms: five failures among 13 patients treated with cefazolin compared with no failures among 12 patients treated with ceftriaxone. Ceftriaxone appears to be an effective agent when given once daily as therapy for many serious skin and soft tissue infections.
