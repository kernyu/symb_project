From the reports of bacterial sensitivity testing reviewed here, it can be concluded that gentamicin has currently a very broad spectrum, with few resistant organisms. Gentamicin, amikacin, and tobramycin are the most effective of the aminoglycosides against Pseudomonas. They are also effective against Escherichia, salmonellae, staphylococci, pasteurellae, Klebsiella, and others; they are less effective against streptococci. Streptomycin is effective but bacterial resistance to it develops very rapidly and there are a large number of resistant strains involved in animal diseases. It is the least effective aminoglycoside that is commercially available. Neomycin is fairly effective against staphylococci, less effective against streptococci, and fairly effective against gram-negative intestinal organisms.
