Each of three isolates of Streptococcus faecalis subsp. zymogenes harbored three R plasmids and a hemolysin-bacteriocin plasmid. The plasmids carried by one of these strains were physically characterized after their conjugative transfer. In each strain one of the plasmids carried genetic markers for resistance to gentamicin, kanamycin, sisomicin, netilmicin, and tobramycin.
