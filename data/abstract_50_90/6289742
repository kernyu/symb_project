Acyclovir (ACV) has been shown to inhibit the replication of herpes simplex virus (HSV) in vitro. We examined a wide variety of HSV clinical isolates for the presence of naturally occurring ACV-resistant (ACVr) variants. Although the ACV doses that inhibited 50% of these isolates were within the range of doses inhibiting 50% of the ACV-susceptible wild-type strains, we successfully isolated variants resistant to high ACV concentrations (25 to 75 microM) from each virion population even in the absence of prior drug exposure. Furthermore, we demonstrated, by fluctuation analysis of two encephalitis strains, that the ACVr variants were clonally distributed in the virus populations before exposure to ACV and did not result from rapid adaptation to ACV. All variants isolated after a single exposure to a high dose of ACV were true ACVr variants, as demonstrated by their plating efficiencies in the presence of ACV. We found that 36 and 50% of the ACVr variants of the two strains examined in detail displayed plating efficiencies in phosphonoacetic acid of greater than 0.1, possibly indicating that many of the ACVr variants contained alterations in the DNA polymerase gene locus. Because the distribution of ACVr variants in natural populations is relatively high (10(-4), these results suggest that selection of ACVr strains during ACV therapy is possible.
