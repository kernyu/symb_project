Experimental and clinical studies were carried out on cefmetazole (CMZ), a synthetic antibiotic of cephamycin group, and the following results were obtained. 1) The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of CMZ against Gram positive cocci (30 strains) isolated from the patients with oral infections showed slightly inferior to those of ABPC, CEZ, while MICs against Gram negative bacilli (166 strains) of CMZ exhibited stronger activity than ABPC, CEZ. 2) The mean serum concentration of CMZ at 60 minutes after drip infusion showed 65.6 micrograms/ml. The concentration of CMZ in oral tissues varied in 4--60% of serum level at 60 minutes after drip infusion. The concentration in pus showed 15.2 micrograms/g at 60 minutes after drip infusion. 3) CMZ was administered by the drip infusion to 22 patients with various infections in the oral surgical field. The efficacy rate was 90.9%. 4) No side effect was observed.
