The effect of grisin on survival and variation of Actinomyces griseus producin grisin was studied. The efficiency of various concentrations of grisin on induction of variation according to the feature of the antibiotic production was compared. A possibility of increasing the productivity of strain. VNIIGenetics-115 by the use of the mutations of resistance to grisin is shown.
