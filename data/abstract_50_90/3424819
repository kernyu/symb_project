Meningitis caused by Yersinia pestis developed in 6 (6%) of a total of 105 patients with plague reported to the Centers for Disease Control from 1970 to 1979. Five of the six cases occurred in children aged 10 to 15 years. All six patients received antibiotic therapy before meningitis developed, which appeared between the 9th and 14th days after the onset of acute illness in five of the six patients. There were no neurologic sequelae. The antigenic and biochemical profiles of the Y pestis strains isolated from cerebrospinal fluid in the meningitis cases did not differ from those of the Y pestis strains obtained from blood and bubo aspirates in the other 99 patients, and neither did in vitro studies suggest antibiotic resistance. While plague meningitis is an uncommon complication of acute plague infection, physicians in the western United States should be aware that it may develop as much as 14 days after antibiotic therapy for the acute plague infection has been initiated.
