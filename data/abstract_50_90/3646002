Coagulase-negative staphylococci were tested for susceptibility to methicillin, cephradine, ceftriaxone, cephalothin, and cefamandole by standard broth microdilution. Most of the 26 methicillin-resistant isolates were susceptible to cephalothin and cefamandole, but very few were susceptible to ceftriaxone, and none was susceptible to cephradine. The proportion of bacterial cells that grew in the presence of 128 micrograms of methicillin per ml was calculated for each methicillin-resistant isolate. Those with every cell or 1 in 10 cells resistant to 128 micrograms of methicillin per ml included the isolates that were most resistant to the cephalosporins and highly resistant to methicillin. Those with 1 cell resistant in 10(5) or 10(6) cells were the isolates most susceptible to the cephalosporins, and their methicillin MICs were lower. When cells resistant to 128 micrograms of methicillin per ml were used as inocula for broth microdilution tests, resistance to cephradine remained the same, but resistance to ceftriaxone, cephalothin, and cefamandole increased significantly. Cefamandole was the only cephalosporin which retained antibacterial activity against some methicillin-resistant isolates (12 of 26). Cephradine, ceftriaxone, cephalothin, and cefamandole resistance appeared to be expressed by the same cells that expressed methicillin resistance. In this way, cross resistance was demonstrated between methicillin and the cephalosporins.
