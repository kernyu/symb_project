Chloroquine uptake by Plasmodium falciparum-infected human erythrocytes (RBC) was studied in vitro before and during culture by measuring the chloroquine gradient between the cells and medium (C/M) by high-pressure liquid chromatography. The C/M values were 5.9 +/- 2.7 (n = 23) for uninfected RBC, 13 to 34 for six chloroquine-susceptible isolates (concentration required to inhibit 50% of parasite growth, less than 100 nmol/liter) in partially infected RBC (parasitemia from 0.3 to 5%) (n = 28), and 8.4 to 4.9 for four chloroquine-resistant isolates (concentration required to inhibit 50% of parasite growth, 320 to 1,500 nmol/liter) in partially infected RBC (parasitemia from 0.4 to 5%) (n = 26). Two isolates were studied before and after adaptation to continuous culture. C/M was found to decrease (34.2 to 2.1 and 19.3 to 4.9), whereas the concentration required to inhibit 50% of parasite growth increased (35 to 1,400 and 54 to 1,500 nmol/liter), thus indicating the acquisition of chloroquine resistance. These results demonstrate that chloroquine uptake decreased in RBC in which the infective strain, initially susceptible, became resistant in culture and imply that the drug is bound to ferriprotoporphyrin IX to a lesser extent or that a parasite protein competes with ferriprotoporphyrin IX to a greater extent. We suggest that genotypic modifications in the mechanism of chloroquine uptake might occur in the parasite.
