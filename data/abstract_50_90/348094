An outbreak of prosthetic valve endocarditis due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis prompted a change in antimicrobial prophylaxis for open heart surgery in a general hospital from a regimen of aqueous penicillin G, methicillin, and kanamycin to a 5-day regimen of cefazolin and gentamicin. As a result, total gentamicin use in the hospital more than doubled. Increased resistance of pseudomonas and serratia isolates paralleled the increased total use of gentamicin. For pseudomonas species, the incidence of gentamicin resistance increased from 3 to 15%; for serratia species, from 8 to 88%; and for the total of both organisms, from 4 to 28%. Resistance decreased rapidly after removal of gentamicin from the prophylaxis regimen. Review of serratia isolates from the urinary tract showed that gentamicin resistance was associated with prior antibiotic therapy, especially with gentamicin, care on the surgical services, especially the surgical intensive care unit, and presence of indwelling bladder catheters. Gentamicin use in a 5-day antimicrobial prophylaxis regimen for open heart surgery can represent a large proportion of the total hospital use of that antibiotic, with potential adverse effects on hospital flora.
