The in vivo and in vitro sensitivity of P. falciparum to quinine were studied simultaneously on 20 isolates of P. falciparum from infected patients in Rangoon and in Tharrawaddy Township. The in vivo study showed 85% sensitive and 5% resistance at RI level. The peak plasma quinine level in all the cases were above mean MIC on days 1, 3, 5 and 7. Schizont maturation was inhibited at 128 p.mol/well in 15% of the cases but the rest were at or below 64 p.mol/well in vitro test. However, no relationship was detected between the in vivo and in vitro sensitivity of quinine.
