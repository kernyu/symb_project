Fifty strains of Branhamella catarrhalis were examined for susceptibility to sulphamethoxazole, trimethoprim and a combination of the two by determinating minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and fractional inhibitory concentrations (FICs). All strains were susceptible to sulphamethoxazole and resistant to trimethoprim. On the basis of the MIC results it was predicted that greater synergy between sulphamethoxazole and trimethoprim would be observed with approximately equal proportions of each component. The lowest FIC values were obtained with a ratio of 1:1 and the greatest synergy was observed at this ratio with 39 strains (78%). Only seven strains were most synergistically inhibited at the ratio of 20:1 (sulphamethoxazole: trimethoprim) although this ratio was still synergic for most strains. Overall the 1:20 ratio was not synergic.
