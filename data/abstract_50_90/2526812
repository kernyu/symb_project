Intestinal brush border enzyme glycoproteins are transported to the microvillar membrane at different rates in the differentiated intestinal cell line Caco-2. This asynchronism is due to at least two rate-limiting events, a pre- and an intra-Golgi step (Stieger B., Matter, K., Baur, B., Bucher, K., Hochli, M., and Hauri, H.P. (1988) J. Cell Biol. 106, 1853-1861). A possible cause for the asynchronous protein transport might be differential trimming of N-linked oligosaccharide side chains. The effects of two trimming inhibitors on the intracellular transport of sucrase-isomaltase, a slowly migrating hydrolase, and dipeptidylpeptidase IV, a rapidly migrating hydrolase, are described. 1-Deoxymannojirimycin, an inhibitor of Golgi alpha-mannosidase I, had no influence on the rate of appearance of these hydrolases in the brush border membrane as assessed by subcellular fractionation. In the presence of N-methyl-1-deoxynojirimycin, an inhibitor of glucosidase I, 30-40% of the newly synthesized molecules appeared at the cell surface, and half-time for appearance of this pool was identical to that found in control cells. The reduced maximal transport to the cell surface observed with N-methyl-1-deoxynojirimycin may suggest that proper glycosylation is necessary for an efficient transport from the Golgi apparatus to the microvillar membrane. Inhibition of glucosidase I does not prevent the acquisition of endoglycosidase H resistance. Furthermore, evidence is presented that the processing in the presence of N-methyl-1-deoxynojirimycin leads to glycosylated endoglycosidase H-resistant glycoproteins.
