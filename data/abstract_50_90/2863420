Prophylactic administration of dibazol (5 mg/day) prevents a decrease of nonspecific resistance and ensures stable variations of adaptive processes in men working in enclosures for a long time. The positive effect of the drug occurs 10-15 days after the administration and involves a combined action on phagocytosis, blood homeostasis, and skin antimicrobial resistance. The integrated parameters of nonspecific protection of the test subjects who took dibazol are close or even better than the pretest level. For instance, the efficiency of intracellular digestion increases and the microbial content of blood decreases. Coincidentally, the health condition improves and physical work capacity increases. Dibazol also exerts a beneficial effect on the adaptive process and morbidity rate of the subjects. The data obtained suggest that dibazol affects favorably the nonspecific resistance of the human body. In view of this, it can be recommended as a stimulating and training agent.
