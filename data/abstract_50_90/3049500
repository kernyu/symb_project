Since 1982, when olaquindox was introduced as a pig-feed additive in the UK, about 12 commercial farms in Suffolk have been monitored annually to check for the possible emergence of resistance to olaquindox and chloramphenicol among the coliform flora of the pigs and their environment. In spite of the sampling variability and the impossibility of controlling the use of feed additives and management on the farms, the overall results obtained were consistent and, it is suggested, the method is widely applicable. A steady, albeit low, increasing incidence and level of resistance to olaquindox was recorded (1982-1984) on farms using it and, to a lesser degree, on neighbouring farms that did not. No significant increase in the level of chloramphenicol resistance was observed. Genetical studies on a selection of olaquindox-resistant isolates suggested that the genes determining resistance were likely to be borne on the chromosome.
