Analysis of stool samples from 912 cases of diarrhea among Chilean infants and 1,112 controls resulted in the isolation of 17 enteroinvasive Escherichia coli (EIEC) strains from diarrhea cases (1.9%) and 3 EIEC from the asymptomatic controls (0.3%). Biochemical analysis of the 20 isolates showed variability among them. However, the majority were lysine decarboxylase negative and nonmotile and utilized sodium acetate. The strains belonged to the O groups 28ac, 124, 143, or 144 or were untypable with the antisera used. Most of them had conjugative plasmids which mediated multiple antibiotic resistance. There was a strong correlation in this group of strains between a positive Sereny test, the presence of a plasmid of 120 megadaltons, and hybridization with the invasiveness probe, an HindIII fragment derived from the plasmid pPS15A. The isolates had a wide range of plasmid profiles. Bioassays and colony and Southern hybridization tests with iron uptake DNA probes indicated that 80% of the EIEC strains produced aerobactin and expressed its receptor, the genes for which are known to be chromosomally located.
