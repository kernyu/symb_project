The clinical effect of sodium nucleinate (SN) was investigated by comparison of the clinico-laboratory findings in 70 patients treated with this drug during the acute stage of erysipelas in addition to antibiotic therapy and the same tests in 100 patients treated with the antibiotics alone. It was shown that SN had a favourable therapeutic effect on the patients with erysipelas. It accelerated the elimination of the local inflammation foci and lowered the incidence of relapses. The therapeutic effect of SN was due to its stimulating effect on the cell and humoral immunity and natural resistance to infection. The results of the study allowed recommending the use of SN in combined therapy of erysipelas for increasing the antibiotic efficacy.
