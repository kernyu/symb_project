In previous investigations, it was demonstrated that interferons (IFN) have antiproliferative effects in human urothelial carcinomas. However, appreciable differences were found in the sensitivity of the individual tumors investigated. We therefore examined whether this might be due to a different receptor status of the cells. The IFN-sensitive cell lines RT4 and SD as well as the IFN-resistant cell line 639V were investigated with regard to their IFN receptor status. It was demonstrated that IFN receptors were present on the cell surface in all three urothelial carcinomas investigated. The number of IFN receptors calculated for the IFN-resistant cell line 639V was 4.661 per cell, whereas the IFN-sensitive cell line SD had 4.391 receptors and RT4 had 3.307 receptors. The IFN affinity of the three cell lines tested differed only slightly. Therefore IFN affinity is unlikely to account for their marked differences in IFN sensitivity.
