The occurrence of secondary and primary dapsone resistance in 199 patients in our control area and the influence of certain variables such as age, initial bacteriological and morphological indices, duration of regular dapsone monotherapy, on the emergence of dapsone resistance was investigated. Ninety one of 122 patients and 29 out of 77 showed secondary (SDR) and primary (PDR) resistance to dapsone respectively. Very low BI (BI:2.5) group also showed both SDR (60%) and PDR (40%). Low or high MI group exhibited the same degree of resistance. Multiplication of M. leprae was obtained even when the MI of the inocula was zero. Even in the group who had 1 to 5 years duration of regular dapsone treatment, 85% patients showed SDR. Significance of such results are discussed in relation to chemotherapy. The overall minimum prevalence of SDR was found to be 5.6% and 21% in the case of PDR in our control area.
