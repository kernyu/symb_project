Antibiotic resistance pattern in clinical isolates of selected gram-negative bacteria at Groote Schuur Hospital during two three-month periods with a ten year interval were investigated. The antibiotic resistance is represented by means of the cross product, or odds ratio, using the log-linear model. This was found to be a simple method of monitoring the change or increase of antibiotic resistance, and enabled an overall analysis, catering for antibiotic and organism effects, to be performed
