This study sought to determine in a district general hospital (a) the frequency and nature of bacterial contamination at operation, (b) the incidence of consequent infection and (c) the prophylactic effect, if any, of interparietal povidone-iodine against postoperative wound infection. Bacterial contamination was shown in 49 per cent of all the abdominal surgical wounds at the end of operation. From 61 per cent of the subsequently infected wounds, organisms identified as contaminants at operation were again found. Interparietal instillation of povidone-iodine resulted in a statistically significant reduction in wound infection (P less than 0.01) in treated patients compared with untreated, randomized, matched controls. It was of significant value in cases of intestinal resection and peritonitis, in obese patients and in those with paramedian incisions. Laboratory studies indicate that povidone-iodine does not induce bacterial resistance. This chemical antibacterial agent may thus provide a preferable alternative to antibiotics in preventing such infections.
