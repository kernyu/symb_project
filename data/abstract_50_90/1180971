The N gene product induces lambda-delayed early mRNA synthesis. This transcription was sensitive to chloramphenicol at the very early stage of phage development, but became resistant within 2-4 min after infection. However, the same transcription was sensitive to the antibiotic throughout phage development if lambda tof- mutant was used as the infecting phage. The results suggest involvement of the tof gene in lambda early transcription; the tof product may act as a stabilizer of the N gene function.
