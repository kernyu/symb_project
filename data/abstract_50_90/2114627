Gamma-interferon (IFN-gamma) has immunosuppressive and immunostimulatory effects. Net results in clinical disease are difficult to predict. We studied possible anti-allergic effects of IFN-gamma in a double blind study in 30 patients with bronchial asthma. We performed quantitative skin prick and bronchial allergen provocation tests using each patient's main allergen prior to and after 20 injections of either recombinant IFN-gamma (100 micrograms each) or placebo, measuring skin wheal area, specific airway resistance (SRaw) and the maximal expiratory flow at 50% of vital capacity (MEF50). IFN-gamma reduced skin wheal area significantly but had no effect on allergic bronchoconstriction.
