In this study we have examined antibiotic susceptibility of anaerobic bacteria isolated from various samples of 75 patients. Anaerobic bacteria from 22 (29.3%) patients, and only aerobic bacteria from 29 (38.7%) patients have been isolated; there has been no growth in cultures from 24 (32%) patients. Of 75 isolates from 51 patients 38 (50.6%) are anaerobic and 37 (49.4%) are aerobic bacteria. Following anaerobic bacteria have been isolated: Peptostreptococcus (13), Peptococcus (5), microaerophilic streptococci (2), Veillonella (1), Bacteroides (9), Fusobacterium (4) and non spore forming anaerobic gram positive bacilli (4). Among the 38 anaerobic bacteria the highest resistance has been shown against tetracycline (65.8%). Resistance rates for cephalothin, erythromycin and penicillin G are 28.9%, 15.8% and 7.8%. In our investigation we have shown no resistance against carbenicillin, clindamycin and chloramphenicol.
