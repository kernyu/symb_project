The mutation frequency of L5178Y mouse lymphoma cells to resistance to 5'-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine increased 6- to 14-fold after growth in ethylene oxide-sterilized polycarbonate culture flasks compared to growth in glass flasks. No comparable increase was observed when L5178Y cells were grown in identical polycarbonate culture flasks sterilized by autoclaving.
