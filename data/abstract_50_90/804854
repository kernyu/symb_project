During the summer of 1973 cultures of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other fluorescent pseudomonads capable of growth at 41 C were obtained from swimming pool waters at a training center for the mentally retarded. Isolates were subjected to selected physiological tests, pyocine typing, and immunotyping. High counts of P. aeruginosa or other fluorescent pseudomonads consisted mainly of single predominant types. Both P. aeruginosa strains and unidentified fluorescent Pseudomonas strains predominated in pool waters at different times.
