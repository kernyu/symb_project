Gonococci that resist standard penicillin regimens by production of a penicillinase are now well established in certain areas of the world. Because cefoxitin, a semisynthetic cephamycin, resists gonococcal penicillinase in vitro, we compared procaine penicillin G and cefoxitin in treatment of gonorrhea in an area where 40 per cent of isolates produce penicillinase. One hundred and seven men with culture-proved gonococcal urethritis were given a single dose of either procaine penicillin G, 4.8 million U, or cefoxitin, 2 g, intramuscularly. Both groups took 1 g of probenecid orally; cefoxitin was given with lidocaine to reduce pain at the injection site. In men infected with penicillinase-negative gonococci, both cefoxitin and penicillin were highly effective. Penicillin failed in 77 per cent of men with penicillinase-positive strains, whereas cefoxitin was completely successful. Cefoxitin is an effective alternative to spectinomycin for single-session therapy of urethritis caused by penicillinase-producing Neisseria gonorrhoeae.
