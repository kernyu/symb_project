A consideral by increased incidence of severe infections in 1975 provided the impetus for a critical analysis of such cases (n = 29) during the last four years. In the group of infections acquired outside the hospital setting, 13 were adnexal infections and 2 were amniotic infections. The group of true hospital infections (n = 14) consisted of 4 entoplastic cases, 7 cases with contaminated infusions and 3 cases of amniotic infections. A shift in the pathogenic spectrum in favor of gram-negative bacteria, particularly Klebsiella, Pseudomonas and anaerobes, was observed in those infections acquired within the hospital setting-- The mortality rate for the whole group was 10% (!).-- In addition to the usual hygienic measures used in hospitals to successfully combat endemic diseases resulting from severe nosocomial infections, a short-term perioperative prophylactic antibiotic, the advantages and disadvantages of which were mentioned, was integrated in the resistance dispositive. In severe adnexal inflammation (2 times in connection with an intrauterine device), the method of choice for surgical therapy was adnexectomy or, if necessary, hysterectomy and drainage. Septicemic diseases in connection with venipuncture material (entoplastic) can be avoided, for the most part, by carefully selecting the type and nature of the material as well as through preventive hygienic measures. The infusions contaminated exclusively by Klebsiella led to particularly serious infectious disease.
