Previous studies have shown that Vibrio alginolyticus and Vibrio parahaemolyticus can be isolated from similar types of marine samples. In this report, the results of an examination of 567 V. alginolyticus and V. parahaemolyticus strains, isolated from seawater in Jakarta Bay and from more than 30 types of seafood from markets in Jakarta, Indonesia, are presented. Most isolates were from mackerel, shrimp, or squid. Numerical taxonomic analyses clustered 337 isolates and three V. alginolyticus reference strains at S greater than or equal to 80%. These strains produced acid from sucrose, but only approximately 80% produced acetoin or grew in the presence of 10% NaCl. The frequency of occurrence of V. alginolyticus in seawater samples ranged from 0% (in February and March 1972) to 100% (in September and December 1972) and was highest in seafood samples from August to December 1972. A second cluster of 230 isolates and seven V. parahaemolyticus reference strains was observed at S greater than or equal to 82%. These strains did not produce acetoin or acid from sucrose, and approximately 20% grew in the presence of 10% NaCl. V. parahaemolyticus was detected in seawater samples each month, with the highest frequency of occurrence (83.3%) in May 1972. Twenty-nine K antigen serotypes were demonstrated in V. parahaemolyticus isolates, and another 40% were untypable. The modal antibiotic resistance pattern for each species included five drugs. Only 12% of the V. parahaemolyticus strains were Kanagawa positive, and 10% elicited fluid accumulation in ligated rabbit ileal loops. All of the 7 V. alginolyticus strains and 94 (70%) of the V. parahaemolyticus strains tested killed mice when inoculated intraperitoneally.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
