2713 salmonella strains having been isolated by veterinary laboratories in the Federal Republic of Germany including West Berlin in 1974 were tested for resistance to tetracyclines, ampicillin, chloramphenicol, kanamycin, gentamycin, furazolidone, nitrofurazone, and trimethoprim. 21.7% of the strains tested were resistant to one or several of the antibacterially effective substances examined. The proportion of the resistant strains amounted to 52% for S. typhimurium and 4.7% for S. typhimurium var. copenhagen, 16.8% for S. enteritidis, and 22.1% for S. panama, 85.1% of all resistant strains belonged to these types. Out of 589 resistant strains found, resistance determinants were present in 93.7% to tetracyclines, 34.6% to ampicillin, 32.4% to chloramphenicol, 25.3% to kanamycin, 3.4% to furazolidone, and 0.5% to nitrofurazone. 1 strain of S. typhimurium var. copenhagen had a transmissible determinant of resistance to trimethoprim. No strain was resistant to gentamycin. 93.4% of the strains transmitted resistance determinants to E. coli K-12. A transmission of resisance to furazolidone and nitrofurazone could not be demonstrated. The serotypes were exhibiting clear-cut differences in their resistances patterns.
