34 penicillinase-producing (PPNG) and 102 nonpenicillinase producing (non-PPNG) strains of Neisseria gonorrhoeae were tested against 9 antibacterial agents. Cefoxitin, latamoxef, cefotaxime and imipenem inhibited all PPNG (MIC less than 2 mg/l); chloramphenicol (2 mg/l) inhibited 86%, and 3% and 8%, respectively, were inhibited by 1 mg/l of doxycycline when disk diffusion or agar dilution sensitivity testing were performed. All PPNG strains were sensitive to spectinomycin (MIC less than 32 mg/l). Non-PPNG strains were uniformly sensitive to all antibacterial agents, doxycycline being slightly less active than the other compounds.
