SF 86-327 (Sandoz Forschungsinstitut) is an orally active allylamine derivative related to naftifine. The antifungal activity of SF 86-327 was compared in vitro with those of naftifine, ketoconazole, and itraconazole (R 51,211, Janssen Pharmaceutica) by agar dilution. 120 fungal isolates were tested. Also, the antifungal activities of SF 86-327 and naftifine against 18 dimorphic pathogens were assayed in vitro by broth dilution. Results of these studies support claims that SF 86-327 is a broad spectrum antifungal agent. Results of the broth dilution studies also revealed that SF 86-327 was both fungistatic and fungicidal in vitro for isolates of Blastomyces dermatitidis, Histoplasma capsulatum and Sporothrix schenckii at concentrations as low as 0.05 micrograms ml-1 (18 isolates tested, MIC90 = 0.39 micrograms ml-1, MFC90 = 12.5 micrograms ml-1).
