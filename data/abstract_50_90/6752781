Twenty-five hospitalised patients were evaluated after treatment with oral augmentin (amoxycillin and clavulanic acid). Ten of 14 with respiratory tract, four of eight with urinary tract and five of five with miscellaneous infections (two with osteomyelitis, two typhoid carriers and one with typhoid fever) were cured. Three of four infections caused by amoxycillin resistant bacteria were cured. The drug was well tolerated even at relatively high clavulanic acid doses up to 1.0 g/day. Augmentin is a potentially useful antibiotic combination.
