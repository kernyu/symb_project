Sensitivity to lysozyme of the representatives of various species of gramnegative microflora (476 strains) was studied with a new modified procedure, which is more exact and economic as compared to the method of serial dilutions in agar. High resistance of Eltor vibrio cholerae and Pseudomonas to lysozyme was found. Cultures of various sensitivity levels to lysozyme were detected among Aeromonas, enteropathogenic E. coli and NAG-vibrios.
