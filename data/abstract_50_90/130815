Samples from blowhole and pharynx of 1 dolphin ill with a respiratory tract infection and 31 healthy dolphins at 2 oceanariums were examined by bacteriologic cultural technique. During the same period, nasal and volar forearm skin samples were collected from 32 healthy personnel and from a furuncle on the forearm of 1 attendant. Coagulase-positive staphylococci were isolated from 8 dolphins (including the ill dolphin) and from 14 persons. Antibiotic sensitivity patterns (8 drugs were tested) differed markedly for the staphylococcal isolates recovered from dolphins, as compared with those from persons. Staphylocci from the dolphins were totally or partially sensitive to every antibiotic, whereas almost all of the isolates from persons were resistant to penicillin and ampicillin, as well as to certain other antibiotics. Staphylococcus bacteriophage typing revealed that only 1 isolate from a dolphin could be typed (type D11). Six of the isolates from persons were typable, but no isolate was sensitive to only type D11. It was concluded that, although Staphylococcus aureus could be isolated commonly from captive dolphins, there was no evidence of cross infection between the dolphins and the oceanarium personnel.
