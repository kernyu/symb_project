Thirteen patients with Aeromonas species septicemia were seen at Westmead Hospital between 1983 and 1987. In 10 patients (77%) septicemia was caused by A. sobria, and in 3 (23%) by A. hydrophila, A. caviae was not isolated. Chronic underlying illness was present in 10 patients (77%), hematological malignancy being the most common (46%). The average age of the patients was 65.8 years. Seven patients (54%) presented with clinical sepsis, diarrhea and abdominal pain. The biliary tract, lung and soft tissue were other primary sites of infection. Nosocomial infection occurred in 5 patients (38%). Cross-infection was not seen. Contact with fresh water or fish was observed in only 2 patients (15%). The majority of cases occurred in the warmer months of the year. The overall mortality was 46%. All isolates of Aeromonas species were resistant to ampicillin 8 mg/L. Ten isolates were resistant to tobramycin 1 mg/L, and 3 to tobramycin 4 mg/L. In contrast, 3 isolates were resistant to gentamicin 1 mg/L, and none to 4 mg/L. The isolates showed a varied pattern of resistance to other antibiotics tested, but all were susceptible to piperacillin 64 mg/L, imipenem 4 mg/L, ciprofloxacin 1 mg/L, and amikacin 16 mg/L.
