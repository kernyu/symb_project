The case of an infertile man with oligospermia and symptoms of urethritis-prostatitis, whose spouse had a vaginal discharge, is reported. Microbiological analysis of appropriate specimens revealed a strain of tetracycline-resistant ureaplasma urealyticum in both patients. Using the transmission electron microscope, it was possible to demonstrate spermatozoal heads "infected" with microorganisms strongly resembling ureaplasma urealyticum.
