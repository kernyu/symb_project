The disk diffusion method was employed to test the sensitivity of a total of 330 Pasteurella multocida strains to streptomycin and kanamycin, of 309 strains to erythromycin, of 315 strains to chloramphenicol, of 240 strains to tetracycline, of 213 strains to gentamycin, of 211 strains to ampicillin, of 209 strains to neomycin, of 199 strains to novobiocin, of 169 to spectinomycin, of 162 to borgal, and of 67 strains to furazolidon. All tested strains were isolated from birds with cholera and from mammals with pneumonia, showing 100 per cent sensitivity to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, tetracycline, gentamycin, and borgal, 88.2 per cent to spectinomycin, 86.6% to furazolidon, 74.2% to neomycin, 52.7% to kanamycin, 23.7% to streptomycin, 32.7% to novobiocin. 13.9 per cent of the P. multocida strains only were resistant to streptomycin. Strains of intermediate sensitivity were as follows: 67.3%--to novobiocin, 62.4%--to streptomycin, 47.3%--to kanamycin, 25.8%--to neomycin, 13.4%--to furazolidon, and 11.8%--to spectinomycin. Ninety-seven strains (42 from birds, 23 from pigs, and 32 from rabbits) were tested for sensitivity in solid media to lowest inhibiting concentrations of tetracycline--4 micrograms/cm3, gentamycine--6 micrograms/cm3, chloramphenicol--12.5 micrograms/cm3, kanamycin--6 micrograms/cm3, erythromycin--8 micrograms/cm3, ampicillin--8 micrograms/cm3, and imekil--0.8 microgram. All tested strains were sensitive to these concentrations. For the treatment and prophylaxis of birds (fowl cholera) and mammals (pasteurellosis) a wide set of antibiotics and chemotherapeutic agents can be used.
