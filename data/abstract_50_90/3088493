Research was conducted in 39 cases of urinary infections caused by Pseudomonas Aeruginosa in patients in various hospital wards. The aim was to assess the onset of such opportunistic infections in the hospital environment as reported earlier by other authors. A comparison was then made between the most commonly used antibacterial drugs used to combat such infections assessing their percentage efficacy on the basis of the germs' resistance to the drug.
