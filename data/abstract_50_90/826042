1. The Authors present the antibiotic sensitivity pattern of 62 Neisseria meningitidis strains isolated in Northern Ghana (Bawku, Navrongo, Bolgatanga and Nalerigu) in February-March, 1973. The following antibiotics or chemotherapeutic drugs were effective in vitro: Penicillin 100%, Ampicillin 100%, Chloramphenicol 100%, Tetracycline 100%, Erythromycin 100% (Nalidixic acid 100%, Nitrofurantion 100%), and the following were less effective: Streptomycin 61.2%, Novobiocin 100% (weakly sensitive), Oleandomycin 95.1% (weakly sensitive), Septrin 87%, Sulphafurazole 91.9%, Sulphadiazine 91.9%. All the isolates were Colistin resistant. 2. The sex and age distribution of patients with positive culture for Neisseria meningitidis shows the preponderance of males over females and the dominance of the group of 5-15 years of age over the other age groups. These results are in good agreement with previous data collected in other countries of the "meningitis belt".
