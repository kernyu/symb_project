Econazole is a broad-spectrum antimicrobic substance which acts by permeabilizing the cell membranes. Glucocorticoids by their surface activity may counteract this effect by protecting the cell membranes. In fact, a protective action of glucocorticoids in high concentrations against econazole nitrate could be demonstrated in yeasts, not in staphylococci. The techniques applied were the Warburg assays (resting yeasts, resting and proliferating bacteria). The elicitation of a blanching reaction on human skin by triamcinolone acetonide was not altered in the presence of econazole nitrate. The data collected in this study were discussed in regard to the combined use of antimicrobic drugs and glucocorticoids in topical therapy.
