The in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility of Yersinia enterocolitica and newly related species isolated from foods was examined. Only 4 of 375 isolates displayed resistance to non-ss-lactam antibiotics. MICs of ampicillin and carbenicillin determined by agar dilution with respect to 125 isolates showed the high susceptibility of Y. kristensenii and biovar 3 of Y. enterocolitica to carbenicillin (MIC for 90% of the strains, less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml).
