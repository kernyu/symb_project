Informational suppressors and antisuppressors have been previously isolated in Podospora anserina, and a range of exclusively genetic arguments have led to the assumption that they correspond to ribosomal mutations. An in vivo and in vitro comparison of the effect of the ribosomal inhibitor cycloheximide on wildtype and mutant strains described in this paper confirms the ribosomal hypothesis for at least some mutants. Indeed, the four mutants in the AS3 gene were cycloheximide resistant, and their ribosomes were found to be resistant when analyzed by polyuridyl-directed polyphenylalanine systhesis. On the other hand, ribosomes from two su 1 mutants were hypersensitive to the drug.
