Results of antibiotic resistance of strains belonging to 9 species of so-called Problem bacteria, recorded by 10 District Public Health Laboratories in Slovakia during 6 months of 1977 (altogether 32641 strains) have been compared with results, obtained with identical computer-assisted system in 1973. The position of "Reserve antibiotics" (gentamicin, colistin, cotrimoxazole, oxacillin, lincomycin, spiramycin) remained favourable during precedent 4 years and even improved (with exception of gentamicin in P. aeruginosa). In classical antibiotics a typical steady-state situation was establishedin that period. Beta-lactam antibiotics in general deteriorated in gramnegatives, with certain improvements in special cases. In "specific pathogens", i.e. enteropathogenic strains of E. coli and in strains of P. aeruginosa, resistance to antibiotics generally increased. On the other hand, in S. aureus strains a better susceptibility to almost all antibiotics could be recorded. Surgical services still seem to use the bacteriological services infrequently and this should improve on an all-nation basis.
