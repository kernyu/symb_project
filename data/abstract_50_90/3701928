In Friend leukemia virus-induced tumor cell lines derived from mice congenic with respect to the H-2 complex, most cell lines expressing the H-2k haplotype continuously produced infectious exogenous virus in culture, whereas most cell lines expressing the H-2b or H-2d haplotype stopped producing virus during in vitro passage. This apparent H-2-linked control of virus production did not appear to be the result of alteration of the provirus or resistance to superinfection. The implications of this finding with respect to virus-induced leukemogenesis are discussed.
