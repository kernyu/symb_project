Shunt infections after implantation or revision of a shunt for CSF drainage in hydrocephalic patients are serious complications. In view of their frequency, this study investigated the efficacy of prophylactic administration of a single dose of the antibiotic cefazedone in reducing in the post-operative infection rate. Fifty children of up to 14 years of age suffering from hydrocephalus of various etiologies were treated prophylactically and compared with a similar untreated group. The diagnosis of infection was based mainly on microbiological and clinical observations and investigations. Classical infection parameters were also recorded and evaluated, but played only a secondary role in establishing the diagnosis as they can change post-operatively without an infection being present. The infection rates observed were 6% in the group of patients who received antibiotic treatment prophylactically and 14% in the untreated control group.
