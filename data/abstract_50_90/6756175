Halofantrine (WR 171,669) was administered to 27 nonimmune subjects infected with the multi-drug resistant Vietnam Smith strain of Plasmodium falciparum. It was also administered to three other subjects, one infected with the Cambodian Buchanan strain of P. falciparum, and two with blood-induced infection with the Chesson strain of P. vivax. It cured infections with all three parasites. Against the highly chloroquine-resistant Smith strain, it was curative in single day treatment regimens. The drug was well tolerated and produced rapid clearance of parasitemia in every case.
