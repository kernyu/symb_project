Experiments designed to establish stable chloroplast transformation require selectable marker genes encoded by the chloroplast genome. The antibiotic lincomycin is a specific inhibitor of chloroplast ribosomal activity and is known to bind to the large ribosomal subunit. We have investigated a defined region of the chloroplast 23 S rRNA genes from four lincomycin resistant Nicotiana plumbaginifolia mutants and from wild-type N. plumbaginifolia. The mutants LR415, LR421 and LR446 have A to G transitions at positions equivalent to the nucleotides 2058 and 2059 in the Escherichia coli 23 S rRNA. The mutant, LR400, possesses a G to A transition at a position corresponding to nucleotide 2032 of the E. coli 23 S rRNA.
