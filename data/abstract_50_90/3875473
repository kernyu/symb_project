Infection due to Gram-negative bacteria continues to be a common problem in the hospital environment, for which a wide variety of antibiotics is available. Among Enterobacteria, resistance is expressed most commonly via beta-lactamases. Temocillin is the first penicillin to show stability to beta-lactamases of Gram-negative bacteria, therefore it is in this type of infection that the initial assessments of temocillin should be made.
