Effective treatment of mice with six to eight week-old patent S. mansoni infections with any one of five schistosomicidal agents (Oxamniquine, Praziquantel, potassium antimony tartrate, Niridazole and Hycanthone) resulted in a reduction in the degree of resistance to homologous challenge in the treated animals when compared with the level of resistance to reinfection observed in untreated mice with intact primary infections. Mice challenged five to six weeks after treatment with Praziquantel, Niridazole or Hycanthone demonstrated a lower level of resistance than mice challenged within 10 days of the termination of the chemotherapeutic schedules. Direct comparison of Praziquantel with potassium antimony tartrate indicated that treatment with the former drug allowed retention of a greater level of acquired resistance than the antimonial in the immediate post-treatment period. Resistance to reinfection in Hycanthone-treated mice was not restored by intravenous injection of S. mansoni eggs before challenge.
