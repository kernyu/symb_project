A new antibiotic drug of cephalosporin group, with marked resistance of beta-lactamase, cefmenoxime (CMX) for parenteral use was tested in 15 patients with acute peritonitis. CMX in a dose of 500 mg was given intramusculary before the operation, to 8 cases with appendicitis, and 2 cases with intestinal obstruction. In 3 cases with appendicitis and a case with intestinal perforation, CMX in a dose of 500-1,000 mg was given by intravenous injection before or during the operation. And in a case with appendicitis, CMX in a dose of 1 g was given by intravenous drip infusion before the operation. Tissue specimens of different sites or body fluids were taken during the operation and from the removed organs. The materials of purulent ascites were subsequently taken at intervals. Determination of CMX concentration was performed according to cup bioassay method with Proteus mirabilis ATCC 21100 strain. The peak of CMX concentration in purulent ascites of patient with panperitonitis for intestinal perforation was 39.5 microgram/ml at 41 minutes after 1 g intravenous administration. Concentration of CMX in pus in the appendix was 52.5 microgram/ml at 20 minutes after 1 g intravenous administration. In 15 patients with acute peritonitis, 11 patients were given CMX in a dose of 500 mg by intramuscular administration twice a day, and the serious 4 patients were given in a dose of 500 mg to 1 g by intravenous drip infusion twice a day. Clinical response was excellent in 10 cases, good in 5 cases, fair and poor were none.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
