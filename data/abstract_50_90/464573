A total of 38 adult patients with acute leukemia who were undergoing remission induction chemotherapy in regular patient rooms were randomly allocated to one of two oral nonabsorbable antibiotic regimens for infection prophylaxis (gentamicin, vancomycin, and nystatin [GVN] or gentamicin and nystatin [GN]) to evaluate whether vancomycin was a necessary component. The patient population in both groups were comparable. Tolerance to GVN was less than GN but compliance was approximately equal (>85% in both groups). Patients receiving vancomycin demonstrated greater overall alimentary tract microbial suppression; however, acquisition of potential pathogens was approximately equal in both groups. The incidence of bacteremia, as well as the overall incidence of infection as related to the number of days at various granulocyte levels, was also approximately equal in both groups. Group D Streptococcus species were poorly suppressed by GN compared with GVN, although no patient developed an infection with these organisms. Colonization by newly acquired gram-negative bacilli was significantly less in the GN group (GN, 3 colonizations; GVN, 13 colonizations; P < 0.01). It is concluded that vancomycin may be safely eliminated from the GVN regimen provided microbiological data is monitored to detect resistant organisms.
