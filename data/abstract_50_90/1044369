The optimal treatment of any inflammation within the area of conjunctiva, after recognition of pathogen and determination of resistance, is not always feasible in the daily practice of the ophthalmologist because usually immediate treatment is necessary. To test the (in vitro) efficacy of the medications available, determinations of pathogen and resistance were made in 100 conjunctival swabs taken from patients with inflammations of the conjunctiva and lacrimal duct. The relatively high incidence of resistance to penicillin, chloramphenicol and tetracycline should be the reason for using more effective substances such as gentamycine and rifamycin. The pathogens and resistance found at present are important criteria for the selection of appropriate chemotherapeutic agents.
