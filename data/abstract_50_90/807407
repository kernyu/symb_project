The study of ultrafine sections of the yeasts of Candida show a difference in the cell between sensitive and resistant strains to 5-fluorocytosine (5-FC). The sensitive strains show a thin border of granular material inside of the clear internal layer which is absent for the majority of resistant strains. After trypsinization, the sensitive strains show a resistance which is reversible and the granular layer disappears. These data permit the conclusion that the middle layer of resistant strains is of protein nature and interferes with the metabolization of 5-FC.
