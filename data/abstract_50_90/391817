Forty-five strains of ureolytic Escherichia coli of human origin, isolated in the United States between 1956 and 1977, were characterized by geographical distribution, site of infection, serotype, resistance to antibiotics, and biochemical reactions. All strains were studied for the ability to generate clones of nonureolytic E. coli (segregants), and a subset of these were selected for plasmid analysis and a variety of bacterial matings. There did not appear to be a common geographical distribution, serotype, antibiogram, or other aberrant biochemical reactions other than the hydrolysis of urea among these strains. The predominance of urinary tract isolates (46.7% total) may reflect a relationship between urea hydrolysis and pathogenesis at this site. Ten of the strains (22.2%) did segregate nonureolytic E. coli colonies, and all possessed at least one common plasmid species with a molecular weight of about 65 X 10(6). Only strain 1138-77 serotype O16:H6 conjugally transfered the ability to hydrolyze urea, ferment sucrose, and resist inhibition by sulfadiazide simultaneously. The resulting, recombination-deficient E. coli K-12 tranconjugant was found to possess a plasmid with a molecular weight of about 80 X 10(6) to 90 X 10(6).
