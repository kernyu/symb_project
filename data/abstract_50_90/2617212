The effects of erythromycin acistrate (2'-acetyl erythromycin stearate), a new erythromycin derivative, and erythromycin stearate on the faecal microflora were compared in a randomized cross-over study. 12 healthy volunteers were given either drug 500 mg t.i.d. for 1 week. Their faeces were studied before, immediately after, and 1 week after the drug administration period. After a wash-out period of 4 weeks, the drugs were interchanged. Both erythromycin acistrate and erythromycin stearate induced changes in the normal colonic microflora to about the same extent. The most marked effect was the suppression of gram-negative anaerobic and aerobic rods. Clostridium difficile appeared in 1 subject on both drugs. Also the counts of aerobic gram-positive cocci were altered; enterococci increased in number. An increased resistance to erythromycin was noted among staphylococci and enterococci after both drugs.
