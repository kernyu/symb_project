A triple (aphr ara-Ar and araCr) mutant (AP7) of Chinese hamster ovary cells resistant to DNA polymerase inhibitors is described. The aphidicolin-resistance of the mutant was stable and inherited as a dominant genetic trait. The DNA polymerase alpha from the wild type (aphs) and the mutant (aphr) cells differed in their elution profiles on DEAE-cellulose chromatography and in their molecular weights which were 192,000 for the wild type (CHO-K-1, AC6a) and 165,000 for the mutant (AP7) enzymes.
