The role of antibiotic treatment was evaluated in 190 hospitalized patients with Salmonella enteritis and 80 with asymptomatic Salmonella infection (without typhoid or paratyphoid). The results indicate that antibiotic treatment does not shorten the duration of excretion (compared with non-treated patients). Because of the danger of prolonged bacterial excretion under antibiotic treatment in complication-free Salmonella enteritis as well as the possible development of resistant Salmonella strains, antibiotic treatment of Salmonella infections (other than typhoid or paratyphoid) should be limited to systemic forms. Treatment of complication-free Salmonella enteritis and Salmonella excretors should be limited to intestine-cleansing measures.
