Strains of Escherichia coli resistant to ceftazidime but susceptible to other third generation cephalosporins were detected in three patients at two different locations (Munchen, Bremen). The resistance was self-transmissible to other E. coli strains. Resistance against ampicillin, kanamycin, chloramphenicol and sulfonamide was co-transferred. The isoelectric point (pI) of the beta-lactamase was similar to the pI of the AER-1 and LCR-1 beta-lactamases. These enzymes, however, do not confer resistance to ceftazidime. Therefore the beta-lactamase described is the first example for a ceftazidimase.
