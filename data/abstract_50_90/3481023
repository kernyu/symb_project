In vitro protein synthesis was used to characterize the antibiotic sensitivity of cytoplasmic ribosomes from wild-type and antibiotic-resistant strains of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Cytoplasmic ribosomes from two cycloheximide-resistant mutants, act-1 and act-2, were resistant to the antibiotic in vitro. The alteration effected by the act-1 mutation, which was dominant in diploids, was localized to the large subunit of the cytoplasmic ribosomes, but no ribosomal protein alterations were detected using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. The act-2 mutation, which was semidominant in diploids, was frequently associated with a charge alteration in the large subunit ribosomal protein (r-protein) cyL38 that segregated independently from the antibiotic-resistant phenotype in crosses.
