In a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strain, electron micrographs showed that cell wall septa continued to be formed in the presence of methicillin, although they became distorted and enlarged. The results indicated that peripheral cell wall synthesis was inhibited. It is concluded that a methicillin-resistant mode of septal peptidoglycan synthesis is an important determinant of methicillin resistance.
