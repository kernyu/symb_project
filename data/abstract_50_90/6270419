The basic and clinical studies of cefotiam (CTM) in pediatric infections were carried out, and the following results were obtained: 1. The antibacterial activity of CTM against S. aureus was equal or slightly less than that of cefazolin (CEZ). Those of CTM against E. coli and K. pneumoniae were eight times more active than those of CEZ. 2. CTM 20 mg/kg was administered wither by 30 minutes or 1 hour intravenous drip infusion. The peak serum levels were obtained at the end of each drip infusion, with the mean peak levels being 44.8 and 41.4 mcg/ml respectively. The serum levels at 1.5 and 2 hours after drip infusion were 2.8 and 2.2 mcg/ml respectively, and at 3.5 and 4 hours after drip and 4 hours after drip infusion were 0.3 and 0.7 mcg/ml respectively. The half lives were 0.62 and 1.15 hours, respectively. The mean urinary excretion over 6 hours were 52.8% in ;the 30 minutes drip infusion group and 42.6% in the 1 hour drip infusion group. 3. Clinical efficacy was evaluated in sixteen cases suffering from tonsillitis (4 cases), pneumonia (4), bronchitis (2), cervical lymphadenitis (2), purulent meningitis (2), suppurative arthritis (1) and suspected sepsis (1). Good and excellent responses were obtained in 15 of 16 cases (93.8%). Bacteriological response in the form of eradication was noted in 4 of 6 cases. Side effect observed was rash in 1 case, and laboratory abnormalities were elevation of BUN in 1 case and elevation of GPT in 2 cases.
