The investigation of plasmid similarity is an important component in the surveillance of antimicrobial resistance and in the detection of epidemic plasmids. The use of restriction endonucleases in the classification of transferable, multiply-resistant plasmids from faecal Enterobacteriaceae isolated at the Children's Emergency Hospital, Khartoum was investigated. Twenty-four transconjugant plasmids, coding for 11 different resistance patterns, each of molecular weight 62 MDa, were studied using four restriction enzymes; Pst I, EcoR I, Hind III and Ava II. Fifteen different digest profiles were obtained. Restriction profiles discriminated between plasmids with differing resistance patterns and demonstrated homology of plasmids with common resistance patterns. Restriction endonuclease digest patterns provide a potentially rapid and reproducible method of plasmid classification, that could contribute towards surveillance systems in tropical countries with a high prevalence of antimicrobial resistance.
