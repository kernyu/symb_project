Glucan, a beta-1-3-polyglucosidic component of the cell wall of Saccharomyces cervisiae, was evaluated for its ability to influence the survival rate in rats with induced intraabdominal sepsis. To mimic closely the human bacteriological intestinal flora, the rats, in 4 groups each of 15 animals, were fed a lean meat diet. Intraabdominal sepsis was induced by resecting 1 cm of the intestine and reimplanting it in the abdominal cavity, reestablishing intestinal continuity by one-layer end-to-end anastomosis. The rats were injected with glucan, isovolumetric saline, and ampicillin or glucan plus ampicillin. The results indicate a significant decrease in mortality in the group treated with ampicillin compared with the group treated with saline only. The group treated with glucan plus ampicillin differed significantly from the group given ampicillin. The bacterial flora was not qualitatively influenced by glucan administration. It is concluded that glucan, in combination with ampicillin, has a significant effect on the survival rate of rats with induced peritonitis, probably by enhancing the activities of the reticuloendothelial system--an important part of the total host resistance.
