For many years the chloroquine-resistant problem in Africa was circumscribed to East Africa, but in the last two years it has been spreading progressively to the West. We report here the two first cases of chloroquine-resistant falciparum malaria imported into Spain from Equatorial Guinea. Both cases show a parasitological grade III resistance in a W.H.O. in vitro macrotest. The clinical recovery with the alternative treatment (Fansidar) was satisfactory.
