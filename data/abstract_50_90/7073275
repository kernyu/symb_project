The effect of environmental storage relative humidity (RH) on the moisture content, viability, and moist heat and gaseous ethylene oxide (EO) resistance of biological indicators (BIs) was evaluated. No statistically significant difference was observed between the initial Bacillus stearothermophilus spore population and the spore population of BIs stored at 20 degrees C and 0, 20, 44, of 55% RH or under ambient, 4 degrees C, or -20 degrees C conditions after 12 months. A statistically significant decrease in moist heat resistance from initial starting levels was found for BIs stored at 20 degrees C and either 0 or 20% RH. There was a statistically significant decrease in the B. subtilis BI spore population, compared with initial levels, when the BIs were stored at 20 degrees C and 0% RH concomitant with a significant increase in their EO resistance. BI storage at 20 degrees C and 20 or 44% RH, or under ambient, 4 degrees C, or -20 degrees C conditions, had no significant effect on EO resistance. BIs stored at 20 degrees C and 66% RH demonstrated a significantly lower EO resistance compared with starting levels.
