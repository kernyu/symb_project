Two plasmids were found and studied in the bacteriocinogenic strain N5 of Clostridium perfringens: one is a bacteriocinogenic factor (MW=5.7 X 10(6)) and the other a cryptic plasmid (MW 32.4 X 10(6)). Simultaneous loss of the ability to produce bacteriocin and of the bacteriocin resistance in a "cured" variant corresponds to the loss of the bacteriocinogenic plasmid DNA. The syntheses of haemolysin 0 and phospholipase C do not seem to be coded for by the cryptic plasmid.
