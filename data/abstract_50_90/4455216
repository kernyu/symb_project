1. The cytosol alcohol dehydrogenase (alcohol-NAD oxidoreductase, EC 1.1.1.1) of Astasia longa was partially purified and characterized from cells grown in the presence of air+CO(2) (95:5) or of O(2)+CO(2) (95:5). 2. Under both these growth conditions, the cells contained a fraction, ADHII, which was characterized by its electrophoretic properties, by a high degree of resistance to heat inactivation, by a sharp pH optimum at 8.2 and by its kinetic properties. The estimated molecular weight of this fraction was approx. 150000, which is similar to that of yeast alcohol dehydrogenase. 3. Cells grown in air+CO(2) (95:5) contain another fraction, ADHI, which can be further separated into two subfractions by polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis and by DEAE-cellulose chromatography. This was termed fraction ;ADHI-air'. 4. In addition to fraction ADHII, cells grown in the presence of O(2) have a twofold increase in fraction ADHI-air activity as well as two new fractions that could not be demonstrated in air-grown cells. These new fractions which we have called fraction ;ADHI-O(2)', account for about 10% of the total activity. 5. The ADHI fractions (air) and (O(2)) have similar broad pH-activity curves and similar kinetic properties, both having a lower K(m) for ethanol and NAD than fraction ADHII. However, they differ from each other with respect to their activity with various substrates. The estimated molecular weight of these two ADHI fractions and their chromatographic behaviour on hydroxyapatite and on DEAE-cellulose also distinguish them.
