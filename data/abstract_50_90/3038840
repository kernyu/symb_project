Tn4551, a clindamycin resistance (Ccr) transposon from the R plasmid pBI136, was cloned onto an Escherichia coli-Bacteroides shuttle vector which could replicate normally in E. coli but was maintained unstably in Bacteroides fragilis. To aid in cloning and to ensure maintenance of Tn4551 in E. coli, a kanamycin resistance determinant (Kmr) was inserted in the transposon. The transposon-bearing shuttle vector pFD197 was transformed into B. fragilis 638, and putative insertions of Tn4551::Kmr were identified by screening for resistance to clindamycin and plasmid content. Southern hybridization analyses were used to verify integration of the transposon in the B. fragilis chromosome, and the frequency of insertion was estimated at 7.8 X 10(-5) events per generation. In 57% of the isolates tested a second integration event also occurred. This second insertion apparently involved just a single copy of the 1.2-kilobase repeat sequence which flanks the transposon. In addition, Tn4551::Kmr appeared to function as a transposon in E. coli. Evidence for this was obtained by the isolation of transposon insertions into the bacteriophage P1 genome. Finally, the transposon vector, pFD197, could be mobilized to other B. fragilis strains in which transposition was detected. Mobilization from the strain 638 background was via a conjugation like process, but occurred in the absence of known conjugative elements or other detectable plasmids. This result suggested the presence of a host-encoded transfer system in this B. fragilis strain.
