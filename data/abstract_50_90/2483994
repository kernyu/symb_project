Streptomyces lividans TK21 possesses inducible ribosomal RNA methylase activity that confers high-level resistance to lincomycin and lower levels of resistance to certain macrolides. The methylase gene (designated lrm) is inducible by erythromycin and other macrolides and also by celesticetin (a lincosamide) but not by lincomycin. The lrm enzyme monomethylates the N6-amino group of adenosine at position 2058 within 23S-like ribosomal RNA.
