Treatment of three murine tumor cell lines, L929, P388, and Pan-02, in vitro with recombinant human tumor necrosis factor (rhTNF) produced evidence of oxidative damage as measured by (a) increases in intracellular glutathione levels, (b) the formation of intracellular oxidized glutathione and (c) the formation of thymine glycols in DNA. L929, the most sensitive of the three cell lines to the cytotoxic activity of rhTNF, had the lowest total glutathione content and was observed to have the highest levels of oxidized glutathione and thymine glycol formation. In addition, the radical buffering capacity of these cells was significantly compromised within 7 h of treatment with rhTNF. The P388 and Pan-02 cell lines, with total glutathione levels about 50-fold higher than L929, also showed evidence of oxidative attack, although to a lesser extent than L929. The radical buffering capacity of these cell lines was not altered by rhTNF treatment. A rhTNF-resistant subline of L929 (L929r), produced by successive passaging in vitro in the presence of TNF, increased its glutathione and oxidized glutathione levels in response to a subsequent rhTNF challenge. Meth A, a cell line resistant to rhTNF in vitro but not in vivo, showed no evidence of oxidative damage following rhTNF treatment, despite having a low radical scavenging capacity and a sensitivity to H2O2. The results with Meth A suggest that the interaction of rhTNF with this cell line does not occur in the same manner as the other cell lines, perhaps due to receptor differences or to some type of "uncoupling" of the signal-response network between the TNF receptor and a putative secondary messenger(s). These results are consistent with the hypothesis that: (a) the mechanism of action of rhTNF involves the production of oxidative damage, including damage to the DNA; (b) the sensitivity to rhTNF in vitro is related to the radical scavenging capacity of the cell; and (c) cells can respond to rhTNF challenge by increasing their free radical scavenging capacity.
