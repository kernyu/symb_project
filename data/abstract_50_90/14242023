An antagonistic action can be demonstrated between lincomycin, a new antibiotic, and erythromycin, when the two drugs are allowed to diffuse into the same area of an agar plate seeded with a strain of Staphylococcus which is resistant to erythromycin but sensitive to lincomycin. The increase in the minimum inhibitory concentrations of lincomycin in the presence of erythromycin may be significant in clinical application. The antagonism does not depend on a reaction between the two antibiotics, but appears to be the result of an altered metabolism stimulated by erythromycin on erythromycin-resistant staphylococci.
