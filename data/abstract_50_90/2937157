The in vitro sensitivity of 26 isolates of Plasmodium falciparum from Rangoon and Tharrawaddy areas in Burma were studied on chloroquine, mefloquine and quinine. The results indicated that the parasites were highly resistant to chloroquine but sensitive to mefloquine and quinine. The existence of correlation of sensitivity to mefloquine and quinine was detected and discussed. No correlation between the parasite sensitivity to chloroquine and mefloquine and or chloroquine and quinine was detected.
