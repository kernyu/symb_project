B. circulans NRRL-B 3312 is a butirosin-producing strain, butirosin being one of aminoglycoside antibiotics. We used shotgun strategy for molecular cloning of butirosin biosynthesis genes. EcoRI digests of B. circulans NRRL-B 3312 chromosome DNA were ligated to EcoRI digests of plasmid pUB110 with T4-DNA ligase. Recombinant DNA was transformed into competent cells of B. subtilis 168. Kanr transformants were selected on medium containing kanamycin (5 micrograms/ml). Results showed that kanamycin and neomycin resistance levels were higher than that of pUB110 for both No. 2 and No. 11 recombinant plasmid DNA. Restriction enzyme maps were constructed for two recombinant plasmid DNA No. 2 and No. 11 respectively. Southern hybridization showed that there were some homogenous DNA sequences between No. 2 and No. 11 recombinant plasmid DNA and B. circulans NRRL-B 3312 DNA.
