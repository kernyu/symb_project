Forty six episodes of infection in 43 cancer patients were treated with oral ciprofloxacin at a dose of 750 mg every 8 h. The overall clinical response was 85%. Patients with microbiologically proven infections had a higher response rate (90%) than patients with infections from whom no causative organism(s) could be isolated (69%). Two of three neutropenic patients responded favourably. Favourable responses were seen in a variety of infections including bacteraemia, urinary tract infection, respiratory tract infection and skin and soft-tissue infection. Resistance to ciprofloxacin developed in one isolate of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Side effects were mild and were predominantly gastrointestinal in nature. Orally administered ciprofloxacin is safe and effective for the therapy of many serious infections in cancer patients. However, more data are required in patients who are neutropenic.
