A benzimidazole-resistant strain of Ostertagia circumcincta (HFRO) was used experimentally to infect lambs. The level of resistance, measured by an egg hatch assay, was studied throughout each infection and also after treatment of the lambs with fenbendazole. The HFRO strain was highly resistant to benzimidazoles. There was day-to-day variation in the level of resistance throughout a single infection with a high level of resistance in the early part of the infection, around Day 27 post-inoculation of infective larvae, falling to a lower level later in the infection. Egg hatch assays on the 3 days immediately post-treatment with fenbendazole showed the resistance level was high then resistance fell to the pre-treatment level after 7 days. Selection for benzimidazole resistance using fenbendazole treatment at the normal dose rate of 5 mg kg-1 over five passages of the HFRO strain in lambs failed to increase the resistance level. Storage of larvae over a 5-month period at 4 degrees C, prior to infection of lambs, did not produce any alteration in the resistance level. The possible reasons for the variations in resistance found with the HFRO strain are discussed along with the implications for sheep parasite control and further development of benzimidazole resistance.
