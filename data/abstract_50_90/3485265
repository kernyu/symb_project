20 patients suffering from severe lower respiratory tract infections were included in the study. 10 patients were given ceftriaxone (1-2 g/day) and the other 10 cefotaxime (2-4 g/day) for a week. The results of microbiological findings and both local and systemic tolerance were found to be similar for both drugs. This indicates that 7-14 g of ceftriaxone and 14-28 g of cefotaxime are equivalent quantities in the treatment of severe respiratory tract infections.
