The narrow spectrum of vancomycin includes the common causal bacteria of endocarditis. This agent has been used since the 1960s for therapy and prophylaxis of infections when first-line drugs are inappropriate because of antibiotic resistance or drug allergy. Some personal experiences of vancomycin usage and a literature survey are presented in this paper which is based on the subdivision of endocarditis into medical, surgical (early--less than 60 days after operation--or late), and addict-related. The commonest bacterial causes of medical or late surgical infections are streptococci, and of the early surgical and addict-related infections are staphylococci. Vancomycin is bactericidal for Gram-positive cocci, except enterococci, but for optimal action it is arguable that combinations with gentamicin, fusidic acid, rifampicin or erythromycin should be used for staphylococcal endocarditis. The attainment of bactericidal blood levels may still be accompanied by failure of monotherapy and the need for early surgery is stressed. The prophylaxis of endocarditis is primarily required for tooth extraction and for cardiac surgery. The streptococci and staphylococci involved are normally vancomycin-susceptible, and the rabbit model shows that it is a suitable alternative to a beta-lactam and aminoglycoside combination. The combination is therefore suitable for patients already in hospital, especially those with prosthetic valves or undergoing cardiac surgery.
