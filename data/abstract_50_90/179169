A new class of 15-azasteroid analogues has been synthesized and tested for antimicrobial activity. The compounds 1, 10, 11, 11a-tetrahydro-7-methoxy-11a-methyl-2H-naphth (1,2-g) indol (methoxyimine) and 1,10,11,11a-tetrahydro-11a-methyl-2H-naphth (1,2-g) indol-7-ol (hydroxyimine) inhibit the growth of Bacillus subtillis and Escherichia coli at concentrations as low as 10-5 M. Addition of either compound to the growth medium casued a rapid inhibition in the transport of radioactive glucose, uracil and several amino acids. The inhibition of growth and substrate transport was reversed following removl of the steroid from the medium. The evidence is consistent with a site of steroid action at the cell periphery. Combining the methoxyimine with polyor circulin at subinhibitory concentrations produced greatly enhanced antimicrobial activity against Pseudomonas fluorescens. Similar action was observed against B. subtilis when the azasteroid was combined with vancomycin or chloramphenicol. The inhibitory action of other antibiotics such as penicillin or erythromycin was not affected by addition of the test compound. The results suggest formation of a molecular complex between the azasteroid and antibiotic which is responsible for the enhanced biological activity.
