Mutants of Bacillus brevis ATCC 10068 were isolated which produced less than 1/100 of the amount of tyrocidine produced by the parent strain. These mutants produced spores at the same frequency and which were as resistant to heating at 80 degrees C for up to 3 h as were those produced by the parent strain. A partially purified tyrocidine synthetase from strain ATCC 10068 catalyzed [32P]PPi-ATP exchange reactions dependent on added tyrocidine-constituent amino acids. These activities were separated into three groups (I, II, and III) by fractionation on an Ultrogel AcA34 column. Each group was similar to one of the three components (heavy, intermediate, and light, respectively) found previously for strain ATCC 8185 except that glutamate-dependent activity was not detected in the group I activities and some amino acyl-tRNA synthetase activities were associated with the group III activities. Some of the mutants were shown to have defective tyrocidine synthetase enzymes. Mutant BH30 was defective in two of the group II amino acid-dependent [32P]PPi-ATP exchange reactions, mutant BH16 was defective in one of the group I and one of the group II reactions, and mutant BH34 had alterations to activities in all of the groups. It is unlikely that any of these mutants could synthesise tyrocidine. We conclude that tyrocidine is not involved in either the sporulation process or the resistance of spores of B. brevis ATCC 10068 to heating at 80 degrees C for up to 3 h.
