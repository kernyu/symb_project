A spontaneously occurring, noninducible, chloramphenicol-resistant mutant of Bacillus subtilis 168 has a mutation (cam-2) which maps in the ribosomal protein region of the chromosome near dal. Its presence does not confer dependence on chloramphenicol. Ribosomes of the cam-2 strain remained sensitive to chloramphenicol in in vitro protein synthesis. No chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity could be detected.
