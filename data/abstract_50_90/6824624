The aerobic microbial flora of 823 eyes with acute bacterial conjunctivitis, corneal ulceration, dacryocystitis, discharging sockets, blepharitis, and postoperative infections has been investigated. Staphylococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and nonfermenting Gram-negative bacilli including Pseudomonas aeruginosa were the main pathogens. Fermenting coliforms were also infrequently isolated. The least overall resistance of 30.9% was to chloramphenicol, but no one antibiotic was effective against all pathogens. Cloxacillin is the best drug for staphylococcal and polymyxin B for pseudomonas infections.
