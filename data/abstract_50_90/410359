Sensitivity of 1492 strains of the causative agents of the surgical purulent infections, i. e. pathogenic Staphylococcus, Proteus, Ps. aeruginosa and E. coli to benzylpenicillin, streptomycin, levomycetin, tetracycline, erythromycin, oleandomycin, monomycin, kanamycin, novobiocin, ampicillin, oxacillin, ceporin, gentamicin and rifampicin was studied. Gentamicin was most active against all the bacterial species tested. The staphylococci were in addition sensitive in a high percentage of the cases to rifampicin, novobiocin, ceporin, monomycin and kanamycin. The isolates of E. coli were in addition sensitive to ceporin, monomycin and kanamycin. Sensitivity of the strains of Ps. aeruginosa and Proteus was low to all of the antibiotics except gentamycin. Most of the strains of the causative agents of the surgical purulent infections were multiresistant to 4 antibiotics. The number of the staphylococcal strains sensitive to benzylpenicillin, streptomycin and levomycetin increased in 1976 as compared to 1975 on the background of a limited use of these antibiotics in clinics.
