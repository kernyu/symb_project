The strain classified as Enterobacter hafniae has been isolated in a severe epidemy of porcine diarrhoea. Its pathogenicity has been found to be cotransmissible with resistance to oxytetracycline when the strain was grown in a mixed culture with some nonpathogenic E. hafniae strains as well as with Escherichia coli. Toxinogenity seems to be responsible for virulence of the strain.
