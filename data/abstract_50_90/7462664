Interactions between dermatophyte fungi and staphylococci or brevibacteria on a new skin-based culture medium are described. Penicillin production by the fungus selects penicillin resistant S. aureus or B. epidermidis. Fungi are inhibited by brevibacteria but not by the staphylococci. "Keratolysis" by fungi may contribute to the growth nutrients of staphylococci.
