Pretreatment of pig isolated bronchial preparations with isoproterenol (Iso) caused a time and concentration-related decrease in both the relaxant potency (pD2) and maximal relaxant effect (Emax) of Iso. Exposure to Iso (5 microM) caused an apparent reduction in the Iso pD2 at 6 hr of approximately 74-fold with a concomitant decrease in Iso Emax from 108 +/- 2 (n = 43) to 55 +/- 6% (n = 11). Responsiveness to the relaxant effects of Iso recovered spontaneously but slowly, being still incomplete 4 hr after desensitization with Iso (1 microM, 3 hr). Responsiveness to norepinephrine and fenoterol was also reduced markedly after exposure to Iso (5 microM), although the relaxant effects of the nonbeta agonists theophylline and forskolin were not reduced. Indeed, the potency of forskolin, was increased 4-fold. The beta antagonists propranolol (nonselective) and atenolol (beta-1 selective) protected bronchi from Iso-induced desensitization, whereas ICI-118551 (beta-2 selective) did not. Furthermore, the dextro (+)-isomer of Iso was virtually inactive as a desensitizing agent. Pretreatment with norepinephrine and fenoterol also decreased the relaxant effects of Iso, although they were at least 100 times less potent than Iso in desensitizing pig bronchi. These results indicate that desensitization was specifically mediated via beta-1 adrenoceptors which predominate in pig bronchus. Alpha adrenoceptor activity mediating increased bronchial tone was apparent in Iso-desensitized bronchi but not in nondesensitized preparations even in the presence of beta adrenoceptor blockade. Neither the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin, nor the phospholipase A2 inhibitor mepacrine had any significant effect on the extent of Iso-induced desensitization in pig bronchus.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
