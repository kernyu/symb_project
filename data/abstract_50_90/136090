Experiments on elimination and transfer of resistance-plasmids in S. aureus (controlling resistance to penicillin, chloramphenicol and oxytetracycline) show that these plasmids have no restricting influence on phages used for typing of staphylococci. Prophages in lysogenic strains control a mechanism of restriction and modification which is active on phages and on chromosomal markers. The resistance-plasmids used in these experiments are insensitive to prophage controlled restriction.
