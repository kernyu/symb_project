The carbonyl-conjugated pentaenes flavofungin, nigrofungin and flavopentin exhibit considerable lytic activity toward Micrococcus lysodeikticus and Bacillus megaterium protoplasts. The antibiotics at concentrations of 5 to 14 microgram/ml cause lysis of 50% of the protoplasts within 15 min of their incubation. The antibiotics inhibit the activity of NADH oxidase and malate oxidase by 50% in the lysates of Micrococcus lysodeikticus and Bacillus megaterium protoplasts at concentrations of 30 to 50 microgram/ml; preincubation of the lysates with the antibiotics intensify the inhibiting action of the polyenes. Growth of the bacteria is inhibited when the minimal concentration of the polyenes is 75 to 100 microgram/ml. Interaction of the polyenes with bacterial membranes lacking sterols indicates that resistance of at least some bacteria to polyenes is caused by impermeability of the cell wall for these substances rather than by the absence of sterols in the membranes.
