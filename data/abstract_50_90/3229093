The in vitro activity of 10 antibiotics was determined for 231 strains of methicillin resistant (MRSA) Staphylococcus aureus. Oxacillin was a very good antibiotic to determine methicillin-resistance. Its agreement with methicillin-resistance was in all the strains tested. On the contrary, the correlation with nafcillin was established only in 95% of the strains tested. Cloxacillin and flucloxacillin are not good methicillin-resistance indicators. The strains tested against macrolides, such as erythromycin, and lincosamides, such as lincomycin and clindamycin presented a susceptibility of 68, 78, and 80%, respectively. All tested strains were susceptible to vancomycin.
