A case is reported of Plasmodium falciparum malaria from East Africa resistant to chloroquine in the in vivo test at the RII level. Serum chloroquine concentrations and the in vitro test indicated RIII resistance. The need for further comparative studies of parasitaemia, serum chloroquine concentration and in vitro chloroquine sensitivity assessment is emphasized.
