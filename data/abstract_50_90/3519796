Because of the recent spate of reports of primary resistance to dapsone among patients with lepromatous leprosy, largely to small concentrations of the drug, a survey was made of the results of dapsone-susceptibility testing of strains of Mycobacterium leprae isolated before 1977 among six laboratories which employed the mouse foot pad technique for this work prior to that time. Data have been found for strains that had been isolated from 73 patients, representing 19 countries and dependencies, with previously untreated lepromatous leprosy; all 73 strains were inhibited from multiplication by dapsone administered to mice in a concentration of 0.0001 g per 100 g mouse diet. These data suggest that the properties of M. leprae isolated from previously untreated patients with respect to susceptibility to dapsone have changed since the years preceding 1977.
