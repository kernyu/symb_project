The sensitivity of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) isolated in our hospital during the period from November 1988 through April 1989 to various antibacterial agents was examined. Isolates were obtained from blood (4 isolates), sputum (40), bile (1), ascites (1) and urine (4). All isolated MRSA were resistant to cefazolin, cefmetazole, cefuzonam, flomoxef, and tobramycin. More than 80% of the isolates were resistant to fosfomycin and amikacin. 60% were resistant to ofloxacin (OFLX). 46% were sensitive to minocycline. 50% or more of the isolates were sensitive to gentamicin (GM), dibekacin (DKB) and astromicin (ASTM). 88% were sensitive to netilmicin. All the isolates were sensitive to vancomycin and arbekacin. The incidence of OFLX-resistant isolates was increased compared with the results of the previous study. Most of the isolates were coagulase type II. GM, ASTM and DKB were less active against type IV isolates, but they had sufficient antibacterial activity against the type II isolates.
