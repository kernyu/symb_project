Using the spin probe 5-doxylstearic acid, we studied the structural perturbations of rat liver mitochondrial membranes produced by exposure to ethanol in vitro and by chronic ethanol feeding. The addition of ethanol in vitro to mitochondria from control animals appears to "fluidize" the membranes, as evidenced by a pronounced decrease in the order parameter. By contrast, in membranes from rats fed ethanol chronically, there was no effect on the order parameter. This resistance of the mitochondrial membranes from chronically intoxicated animals to the fluidizing effect of ethanol probably results from a change in the composition of the phospholipids, because the same differential response to ethanol was observed upon using vesicles of mitochondrial phospholipids extracted from control and chronically treated rats. In the presence of 0.025--0.1 M ethanol, a range that prevails in the blood of chronic alcoholics, the order parameter of mitochondrial membranes from rats fed ethanol was comparable to that of control membranes without ethanol in vitro. Analysis of extracted mitochondrial phospholipids showed that the cardiolipin from ethanol-fed animals had fatty acyl residues that are more saturated than those of controls. These findings point to the underlying molecular mechanism of our previous observation that mitochondria from chronic alcoholic rats are more resistant to uncoupling by ethanol at physiological temperature [Rottenberg, H., Robertson, D. E. & Rubin, E. (1980) Lab. Invest. 42, 318--326]. We suggest that an adaptive change in the phospholipid composition leads to structural alterations, which result in increased resistance to disruption of mitochondrial membranes by ethanol. These changes in lipid composition and structure may explain many, if not all, of the mitochondrial abnormalities that have been previously reported to result from chronic ethanol intoxication.
