Three infants with histologically confirmed chronic interstitial pneumonitis were treated with monthly intravenously administered high doses of methylprednisolone with or without daily hydroxychloroquine therapy. We applied the multiple occlusion technique to measure the static respiratory system compliance, and the end-inspiratory occlusion technique to measure passive respiratory system compliance, resistance, and time constant. When assessed by clinical criteria and pulmonary function measurements, all three patients showed improvement with this treatment. Clinical improvement was associated with an increase in respiratory system compliance as measured by both techniques (60% to 100% increase in all patients). The passive respiratory resistance and the time constant did not closely reflect the clinical course. We conclude (1) that high doses (pulses) of methylprednisolone and daily oral doses of hydroxychloroquine are effective in the treatment of infantile chronic interstitial pneumonitis and (2) that the respiratory system compliance, measured by both pulmonary function techniques, correlates well with the response to treatment and change in clinical status.
