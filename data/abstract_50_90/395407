In acute dysenteries or diarrhoeas shigellae are the bacterial organisms which are the most frequently isolated from coprocultures. The most frequent sub-group is sub-group B (S. flexniri). In vitro, shigellae are sensible to all antibiotics but often resistant to sulfamids. Treatment is not difficult.
