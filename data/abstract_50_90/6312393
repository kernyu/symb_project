MIC of ceftriaxone, moxalactam and cefotaxime is determined for 827 strains of Enterobacteriaceae isolated in the Central Laboratory of the Pitie-Salpetriere Hospital between december 1981 and september 1982. Results are distributed according to the species involved and the pattern of sensitivity (S) and resistance (R) to ampicillin (A), carbenicilline (Ca) and cephalotin (Ct). Among the strains ASCaSCtS and ARCaRCtS cefotaxime and ceftriaxone have the lowest MICs. Among the most sensitive strains ARCaSCtR and ARCaRCtR cefotaxime, ceftriaxone and moxalactam have the similar MICs, whereas among the less sensitive ones moxalactam has the lowest MICs. The latter might be the cephalosporin of choice for the treatment of serious infection due to the less sensitive Enterobacteriaceae. On the other hand, cefotaxime and ceftriaxone might be the cephalosporins of choice for the treatment of serious infections due to the most sensitive Enterobacteriaceae.
