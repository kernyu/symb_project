The authors report the data on immunoglobulins G, A, M content and their relationship with other factors of natural immunity in 55 patients with acute myeloblastic leukemia and in 43 patients with chronic lymphatic leukemia. The results have evidenced the impaired synthesis of immunoglobulins in acute in acute leukemia and the reduction of IgA and IgM already in the initial stage of chronic lymphatic leukemia. A correlation between mean values of immunoglobulins content and other factors of immunological resistance allowed a statement to be made that in the absence of impaired immunoglobulins synthesis there is a distinct coincidence of immunoglobulin content curves and titres of agglutinating and bacteriolytic antibodies.
