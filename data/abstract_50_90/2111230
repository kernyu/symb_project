The wild diastatic yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae NCYC 625 has been shown to be homozygous for the glucoamylase-specifying gene STA2. spoII-1-mapping has positioned STA2 on chromosome II. Expression of STA2 is suppressed in some but not all diploids capable of sporulation, and is also inhibited by unlinked nuclear suppressor genes (SGL) found in some S. cerevisiae tester strains. EMS-induced glucoamylase-negative mutants often contain STA2-suppressor mutations. Depending on the allelic status of GEP1, a nuclear gene which also appears able to antagonise SGL-mediated suppression, STA2 expression can be blocked in petite mutants.
