Cefoperazone has the usual antimicrobial spectrum of the cephalosporins, but the ratios of resistance to the various bacterial strains - even if they are problematic-are very low. It remains to be seen, however, whether a widespread use of the drug induces an increase in the number of resistant strains. An outstanding advantage of cefoperazone is its efficacy against Pseudomonas aeruginosa; only one of 75 strains investigated was resistant. In the case of Providencia, an important germ in the field of urology that is often difficult to be affected by antibiotics, we could not find any resistant strains. We did, however, find moderate sensitive strains. Concerning Enterococci we did not find any resistant strains, but 96% of the strains were classified as moderate sensitive. That leads to the conclusion that the drug should only be effective in high dosage, when Enterococci are found. Even multi-resistant bacterial strains still respond considerably to cefoperazone. This applies in particular to Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
