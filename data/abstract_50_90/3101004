The in vitro activity of spiramycin and erythromycin has been determined by an agar diffusion method against relevant clinical isolates. Generally, erythromycin was more active than spiramycin on a weight-for-weight basis. Spiramycin showed only moderate activity against Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pyogenes. Gonococci were sensitive in vitro to both agents. Many erythromycin-resistant staphylococci were sensitive to spiramycin.
