A new, heterologous, dominant marker for selection of Aspergillus transformants is described. This marker is based on the Escherichia coli hygromycin B (HmB) phosphotransferase gene (hph). Expression of the hph gene is controlled by A. nidulans gpd and trpC expression signals. An Aspergillus transformation vector was constructed which contains this marker and confers HmB resistance to Aspergillus species. With both A. niger and A. nidulans, transformation frequencies of 5-20 transformants per micrograms vector DNA were obtained. Cotransformation with other vectors was shown to be very efficient in both species, when selection for HmB resistance was applied.
