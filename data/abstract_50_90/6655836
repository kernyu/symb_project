Fundamental and clinical studies of cefpiramide (CPM), a newly developed cephem antibiotic with a broad spectrum, were performed and the following results were obtained. The serum levels of CPM after the intravenous injection or the drip infusion of CPM at dose of 10.0 approximately 46.7 mg/kg reached the peak of 75.8 approximately 274.0 micrograms/ml at 30 approximately 60 minutes after infusion and were 3.9 approximately 55.1 micrograms/ml at 8 hours after the infusion. Half-life of CPM in the blood was between 2.4 and 7.0 hours. The excretion rates of CPM into urine up to 24 hours after the infusion were 5.7 approximately 20.4%. Twenty-five patients with acute respiratory tract infection (RTI, 15 cases), urinary tract infection (UTI, 8 cases), cellulitis (1 case) and salmonellosis (1 case) were treated with CPM. The treatment by intravenous injection or drip infusion of 22 approximately 55 mg/kg/day (40 approximately 50 mg/kg/day) for mean 6 days resulted in 100% of good response in 15 cases of RTI and in 88% of good response in 8 cases of UTI. S. aureus, H. influenzae, E. coli, Proteus, Klebsiella and Salmonella group B were isolated from the culture of sputum or urine in the patients, and they were all eradicated by the treatment with CPM. No side effects were observed except eosinophilia in 1 case and the elevation of GOT and GPT in 1 case.
