The human normal intestinal flora prevents the colonization of exogenous bacteria, maintaining a constant microecology: this property is called "colonization resistance". In leukemia patients antibiotics used for prevention and/or therapy of infectious episodes can alter the intestinal microecology, so that the gut can represent the trigger zone for generalized septicemia. Moreover cytotoxic drugs used in these patients can favour intestinal disturbances. In our study we evaluated the in vitro activity of three commonly used antineoplastic drugs (Daunorubicin, Cytosine arabinoside, Methotrexate) against aerobic and anaerobic intestinal bacteria and Clostridium difficile that is the aetiological agent of pseudomembranous colitis. Daunorubicin proved to be the most active inhibiting, in concentration ranging from 16 to 128 micrograms/ml, 50% of Bacteroides strains and 90% of Clostridium difficile and Enterococci strains tested. Methotrexate showed activity only against some Bacteroides strains, while Cytosine arabinoside had no activity at all. We conclude that in these patients the use of these drugs may represent another factor of risk altering the intestinal flora and so lowering the colonization resistance.
