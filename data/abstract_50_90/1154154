Lysosomal disruption with release of lysosomal enzymes has been described in shock. Our study was designed to demonstrate the release of lysosomal enzymes in the liver and lung in addition to determining circulating serum lysosomal enzyme values. Terapeutic means of reducing or inhibiting lysosomal disruption were also investigated. Five groups of baboons were investigated: Group A: (control group) - no endotoxin or treatment administered. Group B: (endotoxin only) - liver and lung tissues showed an increase in free lysosomal enzymes, and a similar increase in curculating serum lysosomal enzymes was demonstrated. Group C: (chloroguine treatment (lysosomal stabiliser) following endotoxin administration) - the liver and lung tissues showed a smaller increase in free lysosomal enzymes and a corresponding lesser increase in circulating serum lysosomal enzymes was demonstrated. Group D: (dexamethasone treatment (lysosomal membrane stabiliser) following endotoxin administration) - the rise in lysosomal tissue and serum enzyme values was less than that in group B. Group E: (combination of chloroquine and dexamethasone treatment following endotoxin administration) - the rise in lysosomal tissue and serum values was less than that demonstrated in group B. The survival of the animals in the various groups correlated well with the lysosomal enzyme tissue and serum values, as did the monitored haemodynamic, hoematological and other parameters.
