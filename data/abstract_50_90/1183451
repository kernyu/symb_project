Ribosomal proteins from three mutant strains of Chlamydomonas reinhardi were analysed and compared by one-dimensional and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. One mutant was streptomycin-sensitive the other two were streptomycin-resistant, one with a Mendelian the other with a non-Mendelian pattern of inheritance. In the 30-S subunits of chloroplast ribosomes approximately 25 proteins are found and in the 50-S subunits 34 proteins. The 40-S subunits of cytoplasmic ribosomes contain about 31 proteins and the 60-S subunits 44 proteins. The molecular weights of most proteins in all subunits are in the range of 10 000 to 35 000. However, the 60-S subunits contain in addition a protein of molecular weight 50 000 and the 30-S subunits show 6-7 bands of molecular weights from 50 000 to 83 000. The proteins of the cytoplasmic 80-S ribosomes or of their subunits from all three mutants are electrophoretically identical. The proteins of the 70-S organellar ribosomes and both of their subunits show distinct differences between the three strains. Our results indicate that organellar ribosomal proteins are in part controlled by nuclear DNA and in part by organellar DNA.
