Ten cases of bacterial infections, showing no or insufficient response to antibacterial chemotherapy, were treated with a new intravenous human gamma-globulin (SM-4300). SM-4300 was administered intravenously (68-172 mg/kg/day) once a day for 1-3 days. SM-4300 was effective in 6 out of 8 pneumonia cases and also in 1 out of 2 septicemia cases. In none of the 10 cases, any side effects were observed.
