A historical review of testing for antibacterial residues in slaughtered animals is presented. In recent developments, much attention was paid to microbiological methods. Because of changing views and new possibilities increasing attention is being paid to purely chemical methods of detection. However, so long as chemical multi-purpose methods are not available, there will be a need for microbiological methods. The common misunderstanding that prevention of residues of antibacterial compounds in slaughter animals will contribute to reduction of the problem of bacterial resistance to antibacterial agents, is warned against.
