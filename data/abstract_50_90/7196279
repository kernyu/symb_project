The results of a computer model designed to demonstrate the effect of antimicrobial exposure (therapy) on the likelihood of isolating putative pathogens and on the proportion of successfully isolated organisms resistant to specific antimicrobials are presented. The results indicate that the observed percentage resistant is not a reliable indicator of the actual percentage resistant in the source population. Data from the Bruce County Beef Project in 1979-80 are used to verify some of the assumptions used in the model.
