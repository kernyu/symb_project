Potassium clavulanate is a novel beta-lactamase inhibitor, which, in combination, expands the spectrum of amoxicillin to include many amoxicillin-resistant organisms. Potassium clavulanate is excreted 30-50 percent unchanged renally and its plasma time-course parallels that of amoxicillin. Several studies suggest that an increased incidence of gastrointestinal side effects may occur with this combination. In the current oral formulation, its greatest utility may be in pediatric infections due to beta-lactamase-producing Haemophilus influenzae and B. cattarhalis. In adults, the combination has not been adequately studied against other effective antibiotics.
