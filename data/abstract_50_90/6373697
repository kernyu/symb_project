Epidemiologic approaches to parasite control, with reduced reliance on the use of anthelmintics, were studied in 6 groups of weaned lambs and 4 groups of suckling lambs grazing fertilized pastures. Strategies tested included prophylactic treatments in the spring, provision of safe pastures, treat-and-move strategies, and winter (prelambing) treatment of ewes. Suppressive treatment with a non-benzimidazole drug was used as a production yardstick against which the epidemiologic approaches were judged. Suppressive treatment with a benzimidazole drug was used to determine the drug resistance status of the flock. The success of each strategy was evaluated by measurements of body weight, wool growth, fecal egg counts, pasture larval counts, and total worm burdens. Prophylactic treatments in the spring were just as effective as suppressive treatments throughout the entire grazing season and resulted in significant (P less than 0.001) increases in weight gain. Effective parasite control also was obtained by moving ewes and lambs to safe pastures (low infectivity) in May, and resulted in significant (P less than 0.001) increases in weight gain. A treat-and-move strategy led to significant (P less than 0.001) increases in weight gain until September, but then a loss of weight in October, suggesting the need for a double treat-and-move strategy in the case of late-marketed lambs. The value of winter (prelambing) treatments for ewes also was demonstrated. Suppressive treatments with a benzimidazole drug confirmed the presence of benzimidazole-resistant nematodes.
