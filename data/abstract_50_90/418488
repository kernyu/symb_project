Primary resistance to tuberculostatics between 1971 and 1975 was studied in a lot of 676 adults with pulmonary tuberculosis, as well as the incidence and overall prevalence of primary and secondary resistance within the district covered by the tb. dispensary of Craiova. The incidence of primary resistance was of 13,61% of the entire lot, falling from 20.41% in 1971--1972, to 14.28% in 1973--1974 and to 7.25% in 1975. The incidence fell from 6.66 per 100 000 in 1971 to 2.3 per 100 000 in 1975, and the total prevalence of resistance from 27.7 per 100 000 in 1971 to 6.67 per 100 000 in 1975. Monoresistance was predominant (8.14% of the total), followed by biresistance (5.18%); primary triresistance was seldom recorded (0.29%). Biresistance rapidly decreased with years down to 1.55% in 1975 and triresistance disappeared in 1975. Although the frequency of primary resistance varies in terms of environment, sex and age of the patients, the differences are not statistically significant. Primary resistance to isoniazide and streptomycin occured in 7.99% of cases each, to ethambutol in 0.15% and to rifampicin in 0.51%. In order to reduce the cases of tuberculosis with primary resistance, endeavours should be directed towards the detection of all M. tuberculosis eliminators, applying a surveyed chemotherapy and following up the bacteriologic evolution of patients under specific treatment.
