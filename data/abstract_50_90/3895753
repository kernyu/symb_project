In a two-year-study, the primary feces of all children with gastroenteritis or acute abdominal symptoms were checked for the presence of Campylobacter jejuni (C. j.) even when there was no diarrhea. C. j. could be isolated 19 times from among 974 fecal samples. The most frequent admission diagnosis after gastroenteritis was the suspicion of appendicitis. In the forefront of the clinical picture was abdominal pain, which radiated into the right lower abdomen especially in children of school age, and which was frequently not accompanied by diarrhea. Apart from a leucocytosis with left shift, the laboratory results obtained revealed no parameters which could be utilized for early diagnosis of C. j. infection. 16 out of 19 isolated strains were sensitive to erythromycin. It is still uncertain whether the clinical picture under discussion can indeed be mitigated by administration of erythromycin, and for this reason controlled prospective studies would be desirable.
