Penicillin and streptomycin in experimental staphylococcal intoxication had different effects on the disease depending on the period of their use. Penicillin injections prior to administration of the toxin increased significantly the resistance of the animals to it, while with the use of streptomycin there was only a tendency to its increase. The use of both antibiotics against the background of the intoxication had a reverse effect: there was a tendency to a decreased animal resistance to a greater extent with the use of streptomycin. The use of tetracycline hydrochloride had no effect on the animal resistance to the staphylococcal toxin.
