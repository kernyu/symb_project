The authors report five cases of invading and diffuse pulmonary aspergillosis. Clinically they are characterized by a development in a still clear pulmonary field in patients with a lessened organic resistance and under corticosteroid treatment. Necrotic phenomenons occurred very quickly and prognosis was poor. Anatomically, foci were spreading, rapidly necrosing and contained Aspergillus. Diagnosis was based, besides etiological circumstances, on the presence of Aspergillus in sputum and of anti-aspergillus precipitins in serum.
