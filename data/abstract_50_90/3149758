The nucleotide sequence of a 1883 bp fragment isolated from a resistance plasmid harbored by a Staphylococcus aureus clinical isolate and carrying the gene, vgb, encoding a hydrolase inactivating the B components of virginiamycin family has been determined. The sequence contains one open reading frame which extends from the ATG codon at nt 641 to a TGA codon at nt 1537 and which potentially codes for a protein of 33.035 Da. This value is in agreement with the apparent size (33 kDa) of the protein observed, in minicell extracts. Inactivation of the B components of the virginiamycin antibiotics as well as resistance to these antibiotics were expressed in a virginiamycin sensitive mutant of Escherichia coli recipient containing the gene on a high copy number plasmid.
