Intravenous inoculation of a penicillin-resistant, phage type 80/81 staphylococcus caused lethal infection in 8 of 15 untreated monkeys. Daily intragastric administration of 50 mg/kg of triacetyloleandomycin, erythromycin estolate, and erythromycin ethylsuccinate was followed by mortalities of 0 of 16, 3 of 16, and 3 of 10, respectively. At dose levels of 25 and 12.5 mg/kg, none of 7 and 4 of 7 receiving triacetyloleandomycin and erythromycin estolate, respectively, died, as compared to 3 of 4 deaths in controls. In vitro sensitivity data and serum antibacterial levels would suggest that triacetyloleandomycin would be the least effective therapeutically. However, this prediction was not fulfilled in these studies of experimental infections in monkeys wherein triacetyloleandomycin was a very effective antimicrobial agent.
