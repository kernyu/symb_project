By 1 hr after infection, 36% of input Semliki Forest virus ribonucleic acid (RNA) which was cell associated was found in a membrane structure. This structure had many similarities to the membrane-associated replication complex (MRC) which had previously been identified in arbovirus infections. Interferon treatment did not affect the association of viral RNA with the MRC structure, but cycloheximide treatment inhibited it.
