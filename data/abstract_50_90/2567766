Routine isolation adequately controlled MRSA strains in two burns units with a restrictive antibiotic policy. Ventilation control and more rigorous change of clothing offered no further advantage. No carriers among staff were found, but some suffered minor skin lesions that were the source of further MRSA spread. Spread of MRSA from the unit to other parts of the hospital was prevented by early identification of colonized patients and by restricting patient and staff movement.
