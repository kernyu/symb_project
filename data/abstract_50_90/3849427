The susceptibility of a total of 2014 Gram-negative clinical isolates (except Pseudomonas aeruginosa) to a number of antibiotics, including temocillin, was investigated in 2 geographically distinct areas. Overall, more strains were sensitive to temocillin than to mezlocillin, piperacillin, amoxycillin plus clavulanic acid, cefotaxime, cephazolin, latamoxef (moxalactam), cefoxitin, or netilmicin. Susceptibility to temocillin of multiple-resistant strains was studied.
