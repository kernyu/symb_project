The data presented are evident of the fact that the causative agents of pyelonephritis in pregnant women and puerpera are mostly Ecsherichia. Ilebsiella, Enterococcus and Ps. aeruginosa were isolated not so often. Strains with multiple antibiotic resistance were mainly isolated from the urine. It should be noted that 64 per cent of the Klebsiella strains and 90 per cent of the Proteus strains were sensitive to ampicillin. It should be taken into account in development of rational therapy of pyelonephritis in pregnant women and puerpera.
