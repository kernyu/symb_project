To discriminate between methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus from 5 nosocomial outbreaks and from sporadic nosocomial infections, the efficacy of a complex typing scheme by phage typing, biochemical typing, resistance phenotype, plasmid profiles, plasmid patterns and attribution of resistance determinants to the chromosome was studied. In addition to the International Basic Set and experimental phages 88-93, 10 experimental phages from the Public Health Laboratory Service, Colindale, London, were used for phage-typing. The 10 experimental phages from PHLS in particular, in combination with plasmid profiles and plasmid patterns, were of special discriminative value.
