Thirteen serotypes of Salmonella isolated from imported ornamental aquarium frogs, snails, and their waters were shown to be multi-drug-resistant. Among the resistances exhibited were resistance to gentamicin, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, cephalothin, and nalidixic acid. Frog isolates displayed eight different patterns and snails isolates had two different resistance patterns. The most common serotype, Salmonella typhimurium, was resistant to 18 antibacterials while other salmonellae were resistant to 9 to 16 antibacterials. Resistances in S. typhimurium and S. bovis-morbificans were conjugative and a number of R plasmids participated in the resistance. The plasmid-mediated resistance in S. typhimurium was stable and the levels of resistance conferred were markedly higher than in the other salmonellae tested. Resistance of other serotypes was non-conjugative and resistance to the beta-lactam antibiotics was unstable.
