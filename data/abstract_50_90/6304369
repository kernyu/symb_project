Susceptibilities of 737 strains of 19 species of bacteria to cefotaxime (CTX) were determined based on the inhibition zone diameter obtained by the single-disc method. Four categories were assessed. 1. Susceptibility of clinical isolates to CTX and 6 other antibiotics Against most strains, CTX showed higher antibacterial activity than other drugs (CET, ABPC, SBPC, CMZ, GM, AMK), especially for S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes and S. agalactiae. Furthermore, CTX was more active than the other antibiotics against E. coli, Indole (+) Proteus, P. mirabilis, Klebsiella sp., S. marcescens, H. influenzae and E. cloacae. 2. Susceptibility of strains isolated from different clinical materials CTX showed the highest antibacterial activity against most strains isolated from sputum, urine, pus, blood and cerebrospinal fluid. However, CTX was occasionally less than potent AMK and GM against strains isolated from bile. Against P. aeruginosa strains derived from clinical materials, the following results were obtained: AMK greater than CFS, FOM greater than CTX greater than GM greater than SBPC 3. Susceptibility of clinical isolates in 7 different fields CTX was the most active antibiotic tested in the fields of internal medicine, pediatrics, urology, obstetrics & gynecology, dermatology and otorhinolaryngology. But in surgery, CTX was less potent than GM and AMK. 4. Susceptibility of clinical isolates of inpatients and outpatients CTX showed excellent activity against many beta-lactamase resistant strains isolated from patients.
