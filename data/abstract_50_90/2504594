In 210 strains of Enterobacteriaceae which were isolated in four hospitals and which showed reduced susceptibility to cefotaxime, high synergy was demonstrated between amoxicillin (20 micrograms) + clavulanate (10 micrograms) and cefotaxime (30 micrograms) using a simple double-disk test. Isoelectric focusing on gel and specific iodometric detection using ceftriaxone identified four extended broad-spectrum beta-lactamases (isoelectric points 7.6, 6.3, 7.0 and 5.9) produced by the strains.
