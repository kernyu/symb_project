By the method "test-vector" the influence of solutions of chlorinated lime, chloramine, sodium base formalin was investigated over 30 strains Salm. abortus ovis isolated from fecal and vaginal samples, as well as from aborted foetus. It was established that S. abortus ovis manifests different stability against the separated disinfectants. These microorganisms are most sensitive to the action of chlorine preparations. For that reason is recommended to use the chlorinated lime and the chloramine with priority for disinfection of Salm. abortus ovis.
