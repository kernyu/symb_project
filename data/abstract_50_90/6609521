Seventy-five children not older than 11 years, with secretory otitis media of more than 3 months' duration were randomly divided into two groups prior to myringotomy. One group remained untreated, whereas the other received erythromycin ethylsuccinate (Abboticin) in standard dosage for the last 10 days before surgery. Nasopharyngeal cultures were taken under general anaesthesia, which ensured an uniform mode of sampling. In the erythromycin-treated group the occurrence of Streptococcus pneumoniae (3%) and Branhamella catarrhalis (0%) was significantly lower than in the control group (35% and 32%, respectively); and the frequency of cultures with no pathogen was significantly higher in the treated group. The occurrence of Haemophilus influenzae remained essentially unchanged.
