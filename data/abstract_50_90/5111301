Reported high activity of rifampin for Pseudomonas pseudomallei could not be verified by extensive in vitro tests conducted with 31 recently isolated strains. Minimal inhibitory concentrations of rifampin were 25 mug/ml for three strains and greater than 25 mug/ml for 28 strains. Rifampin had relatively poor in vitro activity when compared with tetracycline drugs and chloramphenicol antibiotics now commonly used for treating melioidosis.
