pMV120 was reported to carry the tetracycline resistance (Tcr) determinant of class N. We obtained tetracycline-susceptible transconjugants harboring plasmids with restriction enzyme profiles indistinguishable from those of pMV120 isolated from tetracycline-resistant clones. We conclude that pMV120 is a cryptic plasmid and that class N of Tcr determinants does not exist.
