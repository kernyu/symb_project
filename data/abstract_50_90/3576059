In 71 subjects (23 atopic patients, 22 hyperreactive patients and 26 normal test subjects) the authors twice performed a nasal provocation test with formaldehyde in three different concentrations. The test proved to be very much reproducible. There existed no clear-cut significant difference in the threshold for rhinorrhea, sneezing, tearing and pain in the three different groups. The difference in threshold for nasal blockade was very significantly different for the atopic and hyperreactive patients on one hand, and for the normal test subjects on the other hand. After the provocation a small increase in the mucociliary transport time was observed.
