To evaluate the efficacy and safety of parenteral ofloxacin in the treatment of septicemia, a multicenter study was carried out in 88 patients, 53 men and 35 women, hospitalized either in intensive care units (41 patients) or in medical wards (47 patients). Ofloxacin was administered at a dose of 200 mg every 12 hours for a mean duration of ten days. Ofloxacin was administered as single agent to 62 patients. A clinical cure was obtained in 81 patients. Death occurred in 3 cases, relapse in 2, superinfection in one, and persistence of the infecting organism in another case (with acquired resistance to ofloxacin). 89 of the 94 isolated organisms (75% Gram negative-bacilli and 20% staphylococci) were eradicated. The adverse effects were rare, mild or moderate in severity, and always reversible. We conclude that I.V. ofloxacin is efficacious and safe in the treatment of septicemia due to Gram-negative bacilli or staphylococci.
