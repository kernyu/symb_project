We have measured the in vitro response of several isolates of Plasmodium falciparum to chloroquine, quinine and mefloquine. We show that parasites which are resistant to chloroquine also have a reduced sensitivity to quinine. However, there appears to be no correlation between chloroquine resistance and reduced sensitivity to mefloquine. We conclude that the emergence and spread of chloroquine resistance could also be establishing a population of parasites with a reduced sensitivity to quinine which may provide the basis for the eventual emergence of quinine resistance.
