An antibiotic complex active against multiply resistant strains of staphylococci and other Gram-positive bacteria was isolated from cultures of Streptomyces albus G. Silica gel and Sephadex LH-20 column chromatography gave two congeners with Mr values of 786 and 772, which differed by one -CH2-group. The two homologues contained an isothiocyanate group, and proved to be identical with paulomycins A and B produced by Streptomyces paulus; the FAB mass spectra, in addition, proved the same two congeners to be present in proceomycin obtained from Streptomyces alboniger.
