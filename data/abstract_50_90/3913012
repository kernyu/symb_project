Several antifungal agents, at concentrations of 10 micrograms/ml, were shown to suppress ATP concentrations very rapidly in intact cells and spheroplasts of Candida albicans. The highest ATP-suppressing activity was shown by the highly lipophilic imidazole derivatives difonazole, clotrimazole, econazole, isoconazole, miconazole, oxiconazole and tioconazole, which all caused a reduction of cellular ATP content of more than 50% in 10 min. Relatively hydrophilic imidazole derivatives such as ketoconazole were essentially inactive in the test, as were the triazole derivatives fluconazole, ICI 153066, itraconazole and terconazole, and 5-fluorocytosine. Amphotericin B and terbinafine possessed intermediate ATP-suppressing activity, and the dose-response and pH-response curves for these compounds suggested their mechanism of ATP suppression differed from that of the active imidazole derivatives. ATP suppression by azole antifungals did not involve leakage of ATP from the cells and the effect was entirely abrogated by the presence of serum. Intact cells and spheroplasts of yeast-form and hyphal-form C. albicans were generally equally sensitive to ATP suppression, but stationary-phase cells of both morphological forms were less sensitive than exponential-phase cells. The extent of ATP suppression was significantly reduced in stationary-phase yeast cells of a C. albicans strain with known resistance to azole antifungals, but exponential-phase cells of resistant and susceptible strains were equally sensitive. The effect is tentatively ascribed to membrane damage caused directly by the antifungals.
