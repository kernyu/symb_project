Eighteen isolates of Nocardia asteroides were tested for in vitro susceptibility to trimethoprim (TMP) and sulfamethoxazole (SMZ) alone and in various combinations using disc and paper strip diffusion tests. TMP-SMZ showed synergistic action for two-thirds of teh nocardia isolates tested. Five patients with Nocardia pneumonia were treated with TMP-SMZ and all were cured. Four of the patients' isolates were tested and all showed synergistic patterns of inhibition with the spaced disc and paper strip methods. The agar diffusion disc and synergy tests of TMP-SMZ appear to correlate with clinical usefulness when the Nocardia are susceptible with large zones of inhibition around the combination TMP-SMZ disc.
