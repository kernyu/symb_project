When plated in medium containing 0.5 microgram/ml coformycin and adenosine (or adenine) fibroblasts were killed, even if pyrimidines were supplied. Measurements of N-formylglycine amide ribonucleotide synthesis showed that lethality is a manifestation of purine starvation. In the case of adenosine kinase deficient cells, growth was restored by hypoxanthine. The adenylic derivatives block only purine biosynthesis, presumably by inhibition of PRPP-amidotransferase. In this same medium, wild-type cells exhibited symptoms of PRPP deprivation: purine and pyrimidine syntheses were both shut off and HGPRT was simultaneously inactivated. The pleiotropic control by adenosine was abolished in adenosine-resistant mutants that behaved as PRPP "over-producers." These mutations conferred partial resistance to various toxic purine and pyrimidine analogs and preserved HGPRT activity in adenosine-containing medium. This permits selection against these mutants. Evidence suggesting that adenosine kinase products may fulfill a specific function in the regulation of PRPP synthesis is discussed.
