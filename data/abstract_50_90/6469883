The effect of subinhibitory concentrations of lincomycin on the production of lipase, coagulase and alpha-haemolysin by one lincomycin-resistant strain of Staphylococcus aureus was investigated. The highest concentration of lincomycin, which had little effect on growth, completely inhibited enzyme and haemolysin formation. The antibiotic at the concentrations used did not inactivate enzymes. Lincomycin caused no intracellular accumulation of these products, indicating a possible effect on enzyme and haemolysin synthesis. Subinhibitory concentrations of erythromycin and chloramphenicol showed no effect on enzyme and haemolysin formation.
