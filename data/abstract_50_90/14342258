1. Three variants of staphylococcal exopenicillinase (types A, B and C) can be distinguished on chemical, enzymological and immunological grounds. 2. Enzyme type A has a higher specific activity than that of type B, but has a similar combination affinity with anti-(exopenicillinase type A) serum. 3. Enzyme types A and C have a similar specific activity, but enzyme type C has a lower combination affinity for anti-(exopenicillinase type A) serum than has enzyme type A. 4. The sedimentation coefficients and amino acid analyses of the three enzyme types are similar. 5. All three enzyme types have small but significant differences in kinetics of action when hydrolysing benzylpenicillin, methicillin, cloxacillin and cephalosporin C. 6. Peptide maps, obtained from enzyme types A and C after digestion with trypsin, show that these two variants probably differ in the nature of only a very few amino acid residues. 7. Enzyme type B seems to be confined to staphylococci that are members of staphylococcal phage group II. Enzyme types A and C are produced by staphylococci that are members either of phage group I or III, but never group II. 8. The low specific enzyme activity and affinity of enzyme type B towards all penicillins tested suggest that this enzyme type has a lower ;efficiency' in hydrolysing penicillin and therefore in protecting bacteria from the action of penicillin. This could account for the low incidence among ;hospital staphylococci' of penicillin-resistant staphylococci that are members of phage group II.
