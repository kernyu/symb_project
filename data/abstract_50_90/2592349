Pentalenolactone (PL), an antibiotic produced by Streptomyces arenae, is a potent inhibitor of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). The producer strain contains different isoforms of GAPDH: a PL-sensitive enzyme on nonproduction media and a PL-insensitive enzyme on production media. After induction of PL synthesis, the sensitive GAPDH disappears parallel to the disappearance of its activity, as shown by Western (immunoblot) hybridization. The two isoenzymes exhibit little immunological cross-reactivity and differ in size, amino acid composition, and several amino acid residues of their amino termini. Two different types of plasmids from a S. arenae genomic library, named pBRPLR1 and pBRPLR2, were cloned in Escherichia coli by selection for enhanced PL resistance. Both contain a GAPDH structural gene. Plasmid pBRPLR1 increases E. coli PL tolerance 7-fold, and plasmid pBRPLR2 increases it 30-fold. GAPDH from pBRPLR1 transformants shows biphasic PL inactivation kinetics. These cells contain PL-sensitive GAPDH from both E. coli and S. arenae. GAPDH from pBRPLR2 transformants tolerates higher PL concentrations than either E. coli or S. arenae PL-sensitive GAPDH but is less resistant than S. arenae PL-insensitive GAPDH. Nondenaturing polyacrylamide electrophoresis showed this GAPDH to be a hybrid of E. coli and S. arenae PL-insensitive GAPDH. The hybrid enzyme could be purified to homogeneity. Induction of the lacZ promoter of pUC subclones of both GAPDH genes had only a small effect on raising the level of intracellular GAPDH.
