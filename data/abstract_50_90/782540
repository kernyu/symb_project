Mutagenesis of Escherichia coli K12 cells with ethyl methanesulfonate and selection of streptomycin-resistant mutants after a long delay for phenotypic expression allowed us to isolate new types of streptomycin-resistant ribosomes. Misreading patterns of the ribosomes in the presence of streptomycin revealed that most of the streptomycin-resistant mutants isolated under these conditions differed from the four classical types of streptomycin-resistant mutants studied and characterized by Strigini, P. and Gorini, L. (1970) J. Mol. Biol. 47, 517-530.
