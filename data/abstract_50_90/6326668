The mechanism of high-level resistance to streptomycin was studied in 12 clinical isolates of Streptococcus faecalis. Six strains produced streptomycin-modifying enzymes. Each of three enzyme-negative strains tested demonstrated ribosomal resistance to streptomycin. Lack of ribosomal susceptibility is a significant cause of high-level streptomycin resistance among clinical enterococcal isolates.
