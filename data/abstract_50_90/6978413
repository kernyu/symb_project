MOM was administered at a daily dose of 20 to 40 mg/kg q.i.d. orally to 65 pediatric patients. These consisted of 37 cases of acute feverish respiratory tract infection, 13 cases of Mycoplasma infection, 1 case of scarlet fever and 14 cases of whooping cough. Forty pathogenic bacteria were isolated from the 37 patients with acute feverish respiratory tract infection and 1 pathogenic bacteria was isolated from the patient with scarlet fever. Thirty-five of these clinical isolates disappeared as a result of MOM administration. For these 65 cases, the clinical efficacy was good in 51 cases (78.5%), fair in 5 cases (all whooping cough) and poor in 9 cases. Twelve strains of St. pyogenes were isolated from 12 cases and 3 of these isolates persisted (25%). Ten strains of S. aureus were isolated from 10 cases and 1 of these isolates persisted. Superinfection was observed in 3 cases, 2 of which were the same species. Although the clinical effect in the 40 mg/kg/day treatment group was superior to the effects in the 20 mg/kg/day and 30 mg/kg/day treatment groups, the difference was not statistically significant.
