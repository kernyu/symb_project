Apolactoferrin and apotransferrin lost their ability to subsequently bind iron when exposed to an excess of either HOCl or myeloperoxidase plus H2O2 and Cl-. Apolactoferrin, however, was more resistant than apotransferrin. By oxidizing a mixture of the two proteins, then separating them by immunoprecipitation, the difference in susceptibility was shown to be due to the greater reactivity of transferrin iron-binding groups, rather than protective groups on the lactoferrin molecule. The iron-saturated proteins were much more resistant to oxidative modification than the apoproteins. The greater resistance of apolactoferrin should be advantageous for maintaining its iron binding capacity when co-released with myeloperoxidase and reactive oxygen species from stimulated neutrophils.
