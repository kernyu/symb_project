The uptake of nystatin by protoplasts derived from sensitive and resistant cells of Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been studied as a function of nystatin concentration, temperature and pH. The presence or absence of glucose in the uptake experiments was also studied. Activation energies (Ea) for nystatin uptake revealed profound differences between protoplasts derived from sensitive and resistant cells. Those for the latter closely resembled their whole cell counterparts. The values of Ea for the uptake of nystatin under all the conditions studied indicate the importance of the cell wall in the uptake process.
