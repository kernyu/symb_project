A mutant derivative of Escherichia coli K-12 has been isolated which is permissive for bacteriophage T5 infection even when harboring a wild-type ColIb plasmid. The fully permissive phenotype was the result of two mutations that are located near the rpsL-rpsE region on the E. coli chromosome and are recessive to the wild-type alleles. These mutations had little or no effect on induction of colicin synthesis and did not affect the expression of antibiotic resistance by the resistance plasmids R64drd11 or R1drd19. Cells harboring the mutant alleles grew more slowly than isogenic wild-type derivatives in either minimal or complete media.
