In a patients with P. falciparum malaria contracted in Thailand, the course of the disease under treatment suggested resistance to both chloroquine and pyrimethamine-sulfadoxine, as well as reduced sensitivity to quinine. This was confirmed by in vitro tests on continuous culture of the strain. Therapeutic success was obtained with a quinine-cycline combination. The problems raised by the emergence of P. Falciparum strains resistant to polychemotherapy are emphasized.
