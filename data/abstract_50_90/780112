The lipopolysaccharides of ampicillin-resistant cell-wall-defective mutants of Escherichia coli K-12 were analyzed. From their lipopolysaccharides the respective core oligosaccharides were obtained. Following dephosphorylation,the core oligosaccharides were methylated and analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. From core-defective mutants substructures of the K-12 core were obtained. Analysis of the lipopolysaccharide preparations from wild-type K-12 indicated the presence of several core structures with different degrees of completion. The lipopolysaccharide preparation was degraded and the oligosaccharide mixture was partially resolved by gel filtration chromatography. Methylation, gas chromatography and mass spectrometry of the oligosaccharides permitted the tentative formulation of the K-12 core structure. Alternative interpretations for this heterogeneity are discussed.
