We compared the activity of norfloxacin (MK-0366), a new orally absorbable derivative of naladixic acid, with those of other antipseudomonal agents against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Norfloxacin was the most active against both gentamicin-susceptible and gentamicin-resistant strains, having 90% minimal inhibitory concentrations of 2 and 8 micrograms/ml, respectively. This excellent in vitro activity may make norfloxacin effective for oral therapy of P. aeruginosa urinary tract infections.
