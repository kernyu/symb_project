A software package for analysis of antimicrobial drug resistance traits has been developed. It is written in PASCAL and implemented on a microcomputer. The microbiological data to be analysed is reduced to the different patterns of drug resistance found and the associated numbers of isolates. Based upon these patterns of drug resistance, the incidence of resistance to individual drugs and combinations is calculated. Furthermore, the extent and nature of the multiple drug resistance within a group of microorganisms is examined by looking at various aspects of the statistical association of drug resistance traits.
