Eighty-eight strains of staphylococci were isolated from a variety of specimens collected from patients at our university hospital from June to August 1982. These strains were identified as Staphylococcus aureus (86%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (6.8%), Staphylococcus haemolyticus (2.3%), Staphylococcus capitis (2.3%), and Staphylococcus simulans (1.1%). One strain could not be identified with certainty as a currently recognized species. A majority (70%) of the S. aureus strains was resistant to two or more of the following drugs; penicillin G, kanamycin, doxycycline, erythromycin, and chloramphenicol. As for susceptibility to beta-lactam antibiotics, most of the strains that were resistant to penicillin G were also resistant to aminobenzyl penicillin and cephalexin. Whereas none of the strains was resistant to methicillin, cloxacillin, dicloxacillin, nor cefmetazole, and only a few strains were resistant to cefoperazone or cefazolin or both. Over 50% of the S. aureus strains were found to be resistant to each of four aminoglycosides (Kanamycin, gentamicin, tobramycin, and sagamicin), while only 5% of the strains were resistant to amikacin. Multiple resistance to the above four aminoglycosides was observed among more than 40% of the S. aureus strains, and also observed among three of six strains of S. epidermidis.
