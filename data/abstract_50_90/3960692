On the basis of antimicrobial activity, resistance development, pharmacokinetics, side effects and pre-clinical results, the applicability of the quinolones ciprofloxacin, enoxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin and pefloxacin is assessed. These quinolones seem especially useful in infections in hospitalized patients, in gonococcal infections and in urinary tract infections. Also salmonellosis and shigellosis might be indications for quinolones.
