Three hundred and seventeen recent clinical isolates were tested for in vitro susceptibility to the three cephalosporins available in India--cephalexin, cefazolin and cefotaxime by the Kirby--Bauer disc diffusion method. Cefazolin was the most effective cephalosporin against Gram positive cocci (71.8% sensitive) followed by cefotaxime (62.7%) and cephalexin (52.7%). Cefotaxime was very effective against commonly isolated Gram negative bacilli with only 10 (8.8%) isolates being resistant to it while 44 (39%) and 65 (57.5%) were resistant to cefazolin and cephalexin, respectively. All isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were resistant to cephalexin and cefazolin and only 29 (32.6%) were sensitive to cefotaxime.
