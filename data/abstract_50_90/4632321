R1822, a plasmid specifying multiple drug resistances, has been transferred to a variety of species representative of related and unrelated genera. The host range of the plasmid includes Enterobacteriaceae, soil saprophytes, Neisseria perflava, and photosynthetic bacteria. With the acquisition of drug resistance(s), these strains became sensitive to a small, ribonuclease-sensitive bacteriophage, designated PRR1, isolated by enrichment from sewage.
