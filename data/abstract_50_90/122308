Tuberculosis bacilli strains isolated from patients with pulmonary tuberculosis were tested to antituberculosis drugs in our laboratory since 1967 with the same method and by the same staff. However, there was a great fluctuation in the primary resistance rates calculated from one year to another and from one area to another. The analysis of strain sample showed that the main reasons were : the unprecision of patients questionnary, the preselection of strains sent to the laboratory and the unrespect of sanitary sectorisation.
