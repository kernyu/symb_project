The continuously proliferating clones L/B AgA2, CB/Bm 7, Ba/C1, and Bc/Bm 11 were established from bone marrow of MRL/LPR, CBA/J, and BALB/c mice. These clones carry the B cell lineage surface antigen B-220 but not antigens normally expressed on mature B lymphocytes, myeloid cells, or T lymphocytes. Their immunoglobulin mu heavy chain and kappa light chain genes are in germ-line configuration. The G418 resistance gene was introduced into each clone with a retrovirus vector and then used as a selective marker for the progeny of transfected cells. Clones L/B AgA2, CB/Bm 7, and Bc/Bm 11, but not Ba/C1, could develop into antibody-secreting cells after in vivo transfer. None gave rise to cells responsive to polyclonal T cell activators, nor did any differentiate into cells that could develop into granulocyte/macrophage-colony-forming cells in vitro. All grew in interleukin 3 but not in other cytokines. We conclude that clones L/B AgA2, CB/Bm 7, and Bc/Bm 11 are early precursors of B lymphocytes.
