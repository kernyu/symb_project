We developed a marker rescue system for study of competence development and genetic transformation in Streptococcus mutans. The system involved the recombinational rescue of a tetracycline resistance (Tcr) determinant by a homologous, inactive locus (Tcs because of a small deletion). Streptococcal cells harboring this in vitro-prepared Tcs construct (pVA1208) were restored to Tcr when plasmid (pVA981) DNA was used as donor material. pVA981 contained the intact streptococcal Tcr locus and was unable to autonomously replicate in streptococci. Marker rescue with this system followed first-order kinetics and occurred at a frequency 8- or 160-fold higher than did transformation with homologous chromosomal or plasmid DNA, respectively. By using the rescue system, we were able to confirm that competence of S. mutans appeared to be inducible. This was indicated by a sequential increase and then decrease in Tcr transformation frequencies during growth in complex medium. Also, donor DNA binding was not sequence specific, since the recovery of Tcr transformants was reduced by increasing the concentrations of heterologous DNA. We investigated the fate of donor DNA and the kinetics of plasmid establishment in the transformation of S. mutans with plasmid DNA. Monomeric plasmid molecules transformed S. mutans as a second-order process, whereas multimeric plasmid DNA and chromosomal markers were recovered as a first-order process. Approximately 50% of the initially bound donor plasmid DNA was found to remain in a trichloroacetic acid-insoluble form. Our results suggested that molecular cloning in S. mutans would be conducted most efficiently by using helper plasmid systems or shuttle vectors and that gene transfer by transformation of S. mutans occurred in a manner similar to that observed in Streptococcus sanguis.
