During an observation period of 20 months (from January 1978 to September 1979) 123 children with clinically suspected salmonellosis were admitted to the Department of Pediatrics, 70 males and 53 females varying in age from 17 days to 14 years. S. typhi or S. enteriditis was isolated from the stool, urine, blood or cerebrospinal fluid in 85% (105/123) of the cases. The results of the microbiologic examination showed that 28 out of the 105 cases (27%) were resistant to chloramphenicol of which the S. sero-group C1 was predominant. It appeared that 28 cases conformed to the clinical data. In all these cases chloramphenicol was replaced by other antibiotics according to the sensitivity test. The mortality rate was 7% (9/123). Four of the fetal cases were from the chloramphenicol resistant group.
