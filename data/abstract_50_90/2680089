Gel electrophoresis of deoxyribonucleic acid from 11 clinical isolates of Salmonella typhimurium resistant to antibiotics revealed plasmids of different sizes. Most of the plasmids ranging in size from 13 kilobase pairs to 4.360 base pairs were present (1,500 base pairs = 1 megadalton). Some of the plasmids were smaller than 4.360 base pairs.
