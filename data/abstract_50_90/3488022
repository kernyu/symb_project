The in vitro susceptibilities of 16 independent, geographically distinct clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus to trimethoprim (TMP) in combination with sulfamethoxazole (SMX) were evaluated. Although methicillin-resistant S. aureus strains appear to be universally resistant to SMX, the combination TMP-SMX was found to be synergistic in vitro (in combination, the MICs of both drugs decreased 6- to 25-fold) as well as in vivo (5- to 6-fold reduction in TMP at 50% effective doses).
