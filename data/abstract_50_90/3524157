Cinoxacin (CINX) was administered twice a day for 7 consecutive days (400 mg X 2/day) to 34 female patients suffering from acute simple cystitis. The overall clinical efficacy was excellent in 15 cases (94%) and moderate in one case (6%) according to the criteria for clinical evaluation by the UTI committee. The efficacy was not determined in 18 cases. Bacteriological examination revealed 11 cases of single infection by E. coli, 2 cases of single infection by P. cepacia and S. epidermidis and one case of single infection by S. sunguis. MIC of E. coli ranged from 3.13 to 6.25 micrograms/ml. MIC of P. cepacia was 3.13 micrograms/ml and MIC of S. epidermidis more than 100 micrograms/ml. All the strains were eradicated with the efficacy of 100%. There was no relapse of acute simple cystitis in 16 cases after 7 days treatment of CINX. No serious side effects were recognized except for slight general fatigue and heart burn in 2 cases. It was thus concluded that CINX is clinically effective and safe for acute simple cystitis caused by E. coli and P. cepacia.
