Organization of the work of bacteriological laboratories in tuberculosis institutions of the RSFSR is discussed in regard to the aspects of their lawful status, functions and activity results. It was shown with extensive materials (from more than 30 administrative territories) that systemic bacteriological examination of the groups of high tuberculosis risk markedly lowered the number of the sources of tubercle bacilli isolation not registered in tuberculosis dispensaries. Patients with urogenital pathology were found to be frequent sources of tubercle bacilli isolation. It was recommended to decrease the number of assays for drug resistance of the isolates, to perform them only by clinical indications and to change the investigation procedure by testing mainly the resistance of tubercle bacilli.
