A decreasing susceptibility of gonococcal strains to penicillin and other antibiotics has been observed in most parts of the world, including the WHO South-East Asia and Western Pacific regions. In the Neisseria Department, Statens Seruminstitut, Copenhagen, the antibiotic sensitivity of about 100 gonococcal strains from these regions has been determined. The strains were collected during 2 periods, one in 1961 (Ceylon and the Philippines), the other in 1967-68 (Thailand, Taiwan, Viet-Nam and Hong Kong).It was found that the incidence of gonococcal strains with decreased susceptibility to penicillin and most of the more generally used antibiotics is increasing in these regions. The distribution of the 50% inhibitory concentrations of penicillin, tetracycline, streptomycin and spiramycin was similar for the strains isolated in the Philippines in 1961 and for those from the other areas in 1967-68, namely, strains with "normal sensitivity" were lacking. Most of the strains collected in 1961 were fully sensitive to chloramphenicol and erythromycin, whereas about 25% of the strains collected in 1967-68 were only moderately sensitive to chloramphenicol, and about 75% were moderately sensitive to erythromycin; 1 strain was resistant to erythromycin. Only 10% of these strains were sensitive to all the antibiotics employed.In contrast to these findings, several authors report an increasing susceptibility of the gonococcal strains in northern Europe. Possible explanations for the reversion to "normal sensitivity" are discussed briefly.
