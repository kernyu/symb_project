The first evidence is presented for the presence of inducible macrolides-lincosamides-streptogramin B resistance in Bacteroides species. Different macrolides induced clindamycin resistance in Bacteroides vulgatus RYC18F6, an erythromycin-resistant and clindamycin-susceptible strain. A study of 144 Bacteroides isolates indicated that erythromycin resistance was linked to diminished clindamycin susceptibility.
