Development of resistance to ampicillin and tetracycline in Escherichia resulted in an increase in the electrokinetic potential and a decrease in the level of hydration and isoelectric values of pH. The changes in the hydration level mainly depended on the accompanying dissociation. Studies on 3H-tetracycline binding revealed a low accumulation capacity of the resistant mutants. The rate of 3H-tetracycline binding did not depend on the changes in the physico-chemical parameters of the cell surface due to resistance and dissociation.
