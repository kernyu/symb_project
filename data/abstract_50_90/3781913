Protoplast regeneration carried out in a carriomycin producing organism, Streptomyces hygroscopicus 358 AV2, lose carriomycin productivity without loss of carriomycin-resistance and the ability of formation of aerial mycelium. Ethidium bromide treatment on the 358 AV2 strain generated a bald mutant that produced carriomycin and a new antibiotic curromycin. In some other media, however, the parent strain produced curromycin, indicating that the ethidium bromide treatment altered the regulation of antibiotic production. Ethidium bromide treatment on a protoplast-regenerated strain derived from the parent strain resulted in derivatives capable of producing carriomycin and curromycin. These strains were unstable and tended to lose the recovered antibiotic productivity easily.
