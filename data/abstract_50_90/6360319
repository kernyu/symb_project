Among the strains of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae we investigated, the organic form of mercury:methylmercury (II) does not seem to induce any cytoplasmic mutant "petite colonie" rho-. However, it induces a significant number of the erythromycin-resistant mutant Eryr. A dose response is shown. These effects are discussed in the view of the part that discrete DNA lesions could take in the explanation of the mechanism of toxicity of the organomercurial.
