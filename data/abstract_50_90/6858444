In human gnotobiotic studies the number of cfu/g feces expresses the interspecies-specific relations within this biotop. In our study we tried to culture the resident anaerobe microflora diluting 1 g feces to 10(-6) - 10(-9), and using the cystein-blood-agar (Beerens mod. Werner) together with the dextrose-water-blue agar. M. elsdenii appear as big, smooth and yellow colonies, which may be recognised at "first sight" diagnosis. In a retrospective study of 2255 fecal samples we compared the isolation-rate of M. elsdenii in the range of greater than or equal to 10(7)/g feces from healthy people to that of persons with gastrointestinal troubles. M. elsdenii has not been isolated from fecal samples of healthy people but in 12% from those of adults and 7.4% from children, both suffering from gastrointestinal disorders. So we consider that M. elsdenii in the range of greater than or equal to 10(7)/g feces does not belong to the resident anaerobe flora of the intestine. Further studies have to establish wether its normal range may be 10(3)-10(4)/g feces like that of C. perfringens. Comparing the isolation-rate from patients with colon-carcinoma to that of patients with dermatological affections, we found a relation of 8% to 20%. The biochemical activities of our isolates were according to the Anaerobe Laboratory Manual. Additional tests e.g. API-Zym and others make us assume an activity inner the metabolism of fatty-acids and amino acids e.g. inner the aspartat and pyruvat-family.
