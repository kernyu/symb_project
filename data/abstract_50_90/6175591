The in vitro established lines of murine placental trophoblast cells showed little membrane expression of H-2 antigens and a high degree of sensitivity to natural killer (NK)-cell-mediated cytotoxicity. This NK-sensitivity was decreased either by short-term treatment of these cells with murine interferon (IFN) or by culture for more than 4 days in the presence of a tumor promotor, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). This effect of TPA was reversible after removal of TPA from the culture medium. However, IFN treatment of trophoblast cells cultured previously in TPA medium resulted in restoration of NK-sensitivity to the original level exhibited by cells untreated with IFN or TPA. The mechanism for this antagonistic effect is not clear. The decrease in NK-sensitivity of IFN- or TPA-treated trophoblast cells was not due to the loss of NK-recognition membrane structures, or to induction of prostaglandin which elevates cyclic-AMP levels. Inhibition of protein synthesis by cycloheximide restored the NK-sensitivity or TPA-treated trophoblast cells, indicating the possible contribution of de novo synthesized protein(s) which could confer NK-resistance. The TPA-treated trophoblast cells became more tumorigenic, producing larger tumors and a higher mortality than the untreated controls when inoculated into mice. The possible roles of NK cells in trophoblastic diseases and feto-maternal relationships are discussed.
