Exposure of sensitive cells of Staphylococcus aureus to concentrations of gentamicin higher than the minimal inhibitory concentration, results in the recovery of low level resistant strains with a greatly altered phenotype (variants). Because the phenotypic alteration in these strains is so great the expected diagnostic characterization of these variants as S. aureus is obscured. Starting with a genetically-marked parent strain, a comprehensive cytological, physiological, morphological, genetic and biochemical analysis of the variants isolated from it was carried out. The genetic lineage of the variants to the parent was also established by DNA/DNA hybridization. Variants result from mutations in the hemin biosynthesis locus, the effect of which is to disrupt the synthesis of components of the electron transport system, lipid synthesis and selected nucleotide synthesis. Thus the strains are defective in aerobic and anaerobic respiration, (res-), in active transport of aminoglycosides (which confers low level resistance), export of characteristic exo-enzymes, and in cell wall composition and structure.
