The authors propose a complex method of treatment of patients with freshly detected pulmonary tuberculosis suffering also of chronic alcoholism with inclusion of obligatory detoxication measures and intensive combined chemotherapy in conditions of a routine hospital. Treatment directed to alcohol detoxication and abstinence permitted to carry out prolonged systematic treatment with results analogous to those treated only for tuberculosis. In patients combining tuberculosis and alcoholism bacteria elimination ceased by discharge from the clinic in 87.3 +/- 4.5%, destruction closed in 65 +/- 6.4% of patients.
