Two hundred and twenty strains of Streptococcus faecalis (103 isolated in Poland and 117 in Federal Republic of Germany), were tested for antibiotic-susceptibility to 32 antimicrobial agents by agar dilution technique. Most effective in vitro appeared ampicillin, penicillin G, and a combination (1:1) of penicillin and streptomycin. Partly effective were also macrolide antibiotics, trimethoprim + sulfamethoxazole and five tetracyclines. Other antibiotics, including five cephalosporin derivatives, five aminoglycoside antibiotics, two lincomycins, two polymyxins, chloramphenicol and fucidin, appeared practically ineffective in vitro. Effectiveness of antimicrobials in vitro was considered on the basis of standard bioavailability of antimicrobial agents. No differences in antibiotic-susceptibility patterns of any practical significance were found, when strains isolated in Poland and Federal Republic of Germany were compared.
