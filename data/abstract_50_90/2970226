Insulin and insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) stimulate glucose transport in skeletal muscle through separate receptors. The proximal postreceptor events in coupling insulin and IGF-I receptors to glucose transport have been suggested to differ. Denervation of skeletal muscle produces a postreceptor insulin resistance presumably at an early step in the signaling cascade. We examined the effects of denervation and phenylarsine oxide (PAO), an agent believed to block insulin action on transport at a postreceptor step, on insulin and IGF-I stimulated 2-deoxy-D-glucose transport in isolated solei. Denervation (24 h) produced severe IGF-I resistance without affecting IGF-I receptor number or affinity. PAO inhibited insulin and IGF-I stimulation of transport in control muscles by approximately 90 and approximately 70%, respectively. In denervated muscle PAO inhibited transport stimulation by both hormones less than in controls. Conclusions are that 1) skeletal muscle insulin and IGF-I receptors signal transport mainly through a PAO-sensitive mechanism, but IGF-I's action involves a larger PAO-resistant component; 2) the denervation-induced postreceptor resistance of glucose transport to both hormones involves primarily the PAO-sensitive pathway.
