Chloramphenicol resistance (Cmlr) of Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) behaves like a transposon locus, not being localisable in any region of the map and yet being transferable in crosses at a rate comparable to that of chromosomal markers. It can also be transposed onto a plasmid (SCP1) and back to the chromosome. Some traits, such as arginino-succinate synthase production (ArgG), aerial mycelium formation (AmyA), resistance to tetracycline and to rifamycin C appear to be joined to Cml in three processes: co-mutation, i.e. simultaneous loss, post-mutation, i.e. spontaneous loss at high frequency in subclones from Cmls strains, co-transfer, i.e. joint transfer with the cml locus in crosses or during infection by the aggregate SCP1::SCTn1 plasmid. All these processes have been consistently observed with special attention to the argG locus.
