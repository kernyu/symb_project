A Leptomonas of insect origin was highly susceptible to several standard trypanocides and leishmanicides in vitro. Resistance was induced to some of these drugs; clones were isolated from each strain. Cross-resistance patterns of the clones were derived for diamidines, quinapyramine (Antrycide), acriflavin, phenanthridines, and other drugs active against trypanosomes and leishmanias. Clones tested included two each that were resistant to acriflavin, Antrycide, diminazene aceturate (Berenil), and pentamidine and one that was resistant to stilbamidine. Appreciable cross-resistance was evident for all clones. Differences were observed between clones from the same parent strain. Collateral susceptibility towards isometamidium and oxophenarsine was detected in most clone-derived populations. In clones passaged without drug to test for drug fastness, acriflavin and pentamidine clones lost resistance within 10 transfers, whereas Berenil and Antrycide clones retained considerable resistance after 20 to 30 subcultures without drug. Considerations of differences in life cycles suggest that the clone collection may be useful in screening for agents effective against leishmanias and stercorarian trypanosomes rather than against salivary trypanosomes.
