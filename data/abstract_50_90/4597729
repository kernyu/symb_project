In vivo interbacterial transfer of R factor was observed in two patients. Resistance to ampicillin, tetracycline, streptomycin, and chloramphenicol was transferred from Escherichia coli in the intestine of a patient with shigellosis to a Shigella sonnei strain. In a second patient with partial ureteral obstruction, a resistant E. coli strain transferred ampicillin, tetracycline, and streptomycin resistance to a Proteus mirabilis strain.
