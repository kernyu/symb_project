The uptake of labeled palmitoyl carnitine and palmitoyl lysophosphatidylcholine by CHO cells was studied by measuring the extractability of these amphiphiles by bovine serum albumin. A multidrug-resistant cell line, CHRC5, showed a more rapid uptake, compared with the parental line, of these amphiphiles into a pool that was no longer susceptible to extraction with bovine serum albumin. The more rapid uptake by the drug-resistant cell line was reversed back to the rates observed with the parental cell line in the presence of verapamil, quinacrine or cyclosporin A. These latter three drugs also reverse the multidrug-resistant phenotype. These results demonstrate a relationship between the rate of amphiphile uptake and multidrug resistance.
