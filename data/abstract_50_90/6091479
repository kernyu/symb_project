The clinical efficacy and safety of ceftriaxone when administered twice daily was evaluated in the treatment of serious infections, including 9 episodes of bacteremia, 4 of pneumonia, 7 of intra-abdominal or soft tissue infections, 11 of urinary tract infections, 3 of osteomyelitis, and 5 of meningitis. Causative pathogens were Strep. pneumoniae, other hemolytic streptococci, E. coli, P. mirabilis, K. pneumoniae, and species of Enterobacter, Serratia, and Pseudomonas. The overall clinical cure rate was 87 percent and the bacteriologic cure rate was 77 percent. Cures were achieved in infections due to organisms resistant to ampicillin, cefazolin, cefamandole, carbenicillin, and gentamicin. Peak plasma levels were far in excess of the minimal inhibitory concentrations of Enterobacteriaceae. Adverse effects were infrequent, and in only one instance was it necessary to discontinue treatment. Resistance to ceftriaxone developed during therapy with several Enterobacter and Pseudomonas species isolates. Ceftriaxone appears to be a useful agent for treatment of serious gram-negative infections in seriously ill patients.
