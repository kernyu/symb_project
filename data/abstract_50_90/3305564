All strains of Escherichia coli isolated from cases of hemorrhagic colitis and sent to the Centers for Disease Control, Atlanta, Ga., over a 3-year period were assayed for toxicity in Vero cell cultures. Strains that produced moderate or high levels of verotoxin were characterized by serotype, biotype, antimicrobial resistance, plasmid profile, and adherence to HeLa cells. Over 200 isolates were typical O157:H7 strains. Six isolates were atypical O157:H7 strains; two were resistant to antimicrobial agents; one was indole negative, two were citrate positive, and one was urea positive. Six isolates were nonmotile O157 strains. All of these isolates were similar to typical O157:H7 strains by plasmid profile and negative or slow sorbitol fermentation. Eleven other verotoxigenic isolates did not possess the O157 antigen, had a variety of plasmid profiles, and were sorbitol positive. Two of the eleven were enteropathogenic serotypes (O111:NM and O26:H11), yet none were adherent to HeLa cells. We conclude that verotoxigenic E. coli associated with hemorrhagic colitis includes atypical O157 strains and other serotypes. Hence, investigators should use current screening methods with caution.
