An in vitro study of sensitivity of Plasmodium falciparum to chloroquine and mefloquine in Ghana is described. Results of 60 short-term cultures from 36 patients are evaluated. No sign of chloroquine resistance was found as all microtests showed complete inhibition of maturation at a level of 0.8 X 10(-6) M. For mefloquine schizont maturation was seen at higher levels of the drug. However, the estimated EC99, with 2.2830 X 10(-6) M is probably within the range of sensitivity.
