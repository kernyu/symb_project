Candida albicans cells were exposed to equal concentrations of amphotericin B (AmB) administered either as a single large dose or as repeated small doses. Toxicity to C. albicans cells was less pronounced when AmB was administered in fractionated doses. Increased catalase activity in C. albicans cells was induced after exposure to fractionated doses of AmB; this increase may have contributed to the greater resistance of cells to AmB used according to this schedule.
