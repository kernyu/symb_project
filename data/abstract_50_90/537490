A review of 130 children cases of typhoid fever in Saigon (Vietnam). Leuco-neutropenia is far from regular but thrombopenia is frequent. The typhoid bacillus is generally cultivated from blood during the first two weeks of the evolution. There is evidence in most S. typhi strains of a plasmid resistance for streptomycine, chloramphenicol, tetracycline and sulfamides. Strains of the various other enterobacteria of the intestinal flora are generally resistant for many more antibiotics than S. typhi.
