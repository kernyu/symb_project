Two hundred and forty-three cases of impetigo, which were seen in children in Sydney in the three-year period from July, 1983 to June, 1986, were studied. The great majority of cases was seen in summer and autumn, and over half the cases occurred in the preschool age group. Staphylococcus aureus was grown from 86% of the cases; in 69% of cases it was the only organism to be found, indicating the predominant importance of this organism in impetigo in Sydney in the 1980s. Antibiotic-sensitivity testing of the staphylococci that were cultured demonstrated that fewer than 2% of strains were sensitive to penicillin and fewer than 50% of strains were sensitive to erythromycin. Our experience suggests that flucloxacillin is the antibiotic agent of choice in the treatment of impetigo in children in Sydney.
