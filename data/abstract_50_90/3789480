Eight Capnocytophaga infections are described: bacteremia in immunodepressed patients (three cases), endocarditis (one case), pneumopathy (one case), buccal infection (two cases) and endometritis during use of an intrauterine contraceptive device (one case). The role of this bacterium in infections presented by immunodepressed patients is discussed in terms of literature data. Identification of the genus posed no problems. Species diagnosis is considered in terms of the use of conventional biochemical tests and the API ZYM collection.
