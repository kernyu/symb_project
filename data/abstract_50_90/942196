As a result of the experiments it was found the negativation of the sputum was 2 times higher in patients treated in addtion with inhalation of antibacterial drugs as compared to that in patients using no aerosol therapy. The rate of isolation of pathogenic staphylococci to the end of the treatment course was statistically insignificant though there was some tendency to an increase. No significant difference was observed in the antibiotic resistance development in the coccal and bacterial flora of the patients treated and not treated with streptomycin in the form of inhalation.
