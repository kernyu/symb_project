Between December 1988 and March 1989 twelve patients in the Utrecht University Hospital developed an infection with a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Twenty other patients and 39 personnel members became colonized with the same MRSA strain. In spite of early isolation measures, progression of this epidemic was probably caused by the extreme degree of contagiousness of the first patient, who had a drug-induced allergic skin eruption. It seems likely that spread occurred via personnel and via a computer tomographic scanner. To contain the epidemic it was necessary to institute a special isolation ward with dedicated personnel. Although several MRSA strains have been introduced in the University Hospital since 1986, the strain we describe here is the only one which spread epidemically.
