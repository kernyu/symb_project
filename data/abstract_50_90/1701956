Previous work showed that interferon (IFN) can protect target cells from NK mediated lysis in vitro. In the present study we investigate the effect of IFN alpha/beta or IFN gamma treatment of three different murine leukemia cell lines. For this purpose FLC-745 (susceptible to the antiproliferative activity of IFN alpha/beta and gamma), FLC-3C18 (IFN alpha/beta -resistant and IFN gamma - susceptible) of DBA/2 origin and EL-4 (IFN alpha/beta - susceptible and IFN gamma - resistant) leukemia of C57B1/6 origin were treated with IFN alpha/beta or gamma in vitro and assayed for their susceptibility to natural resistance measured in vivo as organ rapid clearance 4 hr after iv injection into syngeneic mice. Using young or Poly I:C stimulated hosts, but not mice with low levels of natural resistance (i.e. older animals or mice treated with cyclophosphamide), slower elimination of treated cells was observed with: (a) FLC-745 cells treated with IFN alpha/beta and IFN gamma and (b) FLC 3C18 treated with IFN gamma. Such a delayed clearance was not observed with: (a) FLC-3C18 cells treated with IFN alpha/beta and (b) EL-4 leukemia cells preincubated with IFN alpha/beta or IFN gamma. These results suggest that under selected conditions IFNs can protect leukemic cells from in vivo natural reactivity.
