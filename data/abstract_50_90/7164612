The resistance of 708 germs isolated from 656 samples of ambulatory urological and gynecological origin was determined. The sensitivity of E. coli, proteus types and Pseudomonas aeruginosa to internationally used antibiotics was registered in detail as percentages. On the basis of the frequency of the germs and their resistence, an antibiotic "hierarchy" is drawn up, which can simplify the initial choice of therapy, especially in out-patient treatment.
