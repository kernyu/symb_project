Methionine-requiring and pantothenic acid-requiring auxotrophs of Rhizobium japanicum USDA 31, as well as highly antibiotic-resistant mutants of R. japonicum strains USDA 31, USDA 110, USDA 138, and Webster 48, were isolated. These mutants were used to transfer the P-1 group plasmids R68.45 and RP4 within and between strains USDA 31, USDA 110, and Webster 48. Attempts to demonstrate transfer of either plasmid to strain USDA 138 were unsuccessful.
