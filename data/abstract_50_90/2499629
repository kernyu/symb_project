C3H/HeN mice that are naturally resistant to cutaneous disease and systemic infections with the protozoan parasite, Leishmania major, were treated at the time of infection, and weekly thereafter, with mouse anti-rat IFN-gamma mAb or an irrelevant antibody of similar isotype. Anti-IFN-gamma-treated mice developed cutaneous lesions; parasites spread to the regional lymph nodes and then metastasized to spleens and livers. The course of disease in these animals was similar to that of genetically susceptible BALB/c mice. Two exceptions in the pathology of L. major infections were noted between BALB/c and anti-IFN-gamma-treated C3H/HeN mice: 1) BALB/c mice died of systemic complications, whereas C3H/HeN mice did not, and 2) multinucleated giant cells were observed in lymph nodes and spleens of infected BALB/c mice, whereas these cells were not observed in infected C3H/HeN mice. Control mice, those treated with either saline or irrelevant antibody of the same isotype as the anti-IFN-gamma monoclonal, showed no evidence of cutaneous disease (development of footpad lesions) or systemic infection (by histopathology). Total abrogation of the natural resistance of C3H/HeN mice could be achieved by treatment with as little as 0.5 mg/mouse/wk of anti-IFN-gamma antibody, or by a single dose of 1 mg/mouse anti-IFN-gamma antibody administered at the time of parasite inoculation. If antibody treatment was delayed for as little as 1 wk after parasite inoculation, the infections in treated animals resembled that of untreated or control antibody-treated mice: no cutaneous lesions (by footpad swelling or viable counts of leishmania in footpad tissue) or systemic disease (by microscopic analysis of touch preparations of internal organs, and histopathology of same). The production of IFN-gamma during the initial interaction of the parasite and host cells appears to be a major component of genetic control of natural resistance to infection with L. major in C3H/HeN mice.
