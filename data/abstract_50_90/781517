pKM101, a plasmid R factor of the N compatibility group increases methylmethane sulfonate mutagenesis and diminishes UV-killing in recA+ LEX+ and recA+ lex- strains, , but not in recA-lex+ strains. The induction of a "reclex" dependent colicin is not present in lex- strains carrying the pKM101 factor. These facts indicate that pKM101 acts through an error-prone DNA repair system which is recA+ dependent, but not lex+ dependent.
