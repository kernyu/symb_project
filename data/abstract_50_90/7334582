For the purpose of preventing postoperative orthopedic infections, investigation was carried out on effectiveness and safety of amikacin (AMK) after washing wound surface with its solution. 500 ml saline solution containing 400 mg AMK was used for washing. As the result, no postoperative infections were observed in all the 19 patients operated in our department. Neither abnormal findings to be regarded as abnormalities in blood test nor side-effects caused by washing were also observed. The blood samples obtained after washing did not show measurable AMK in all cases. It is said that use of antibiotics with 1) a wide-range of spectrum, 2) a bactericidal action and 3) low cross resistance against other antibiotics is preferable in washing wound surface in order to prevent postoperative infections. Under these circumstances, administration of aminoglycoside antibiotics is used frequently. Concerning the use of aminoglycoside antibiotics, however, it is necessary to pay attention to auditory and renal impairment. The previous study has revealed that AMK is lower in auditory and renal toxicity than other aminoglycoside antibiotics. AMK is thought, therefore, to be free from fear of auditory and renal impairment after washing and also to be one of effective antibiotics.
