A line of Eimeria tenella (H) resistant to robenidine, decoquinate and amprolium has been produced by genetic recombination. It was not possible to obtain a cross between this line and lines resistant to clopidol or arprinocid and halofuginone. Recombination between lines resistant to arprinocid and halofuginone resulted in a loss of pathogenicity.
