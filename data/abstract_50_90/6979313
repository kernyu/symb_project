Certain technical considerations which affected the status of methicillin tolerance in Staphylococcus aureus strains were studied. Methods which consistently demonstrated tolerance or intolerance of a given strain were avoidance of inoculum splashing, use of stationary-phase inoculum, 24-h tube incubation, and minimization of antibiotic carry-over. These studies suggested a need for the establishment of a standardized reference for the determination of tolerance.
