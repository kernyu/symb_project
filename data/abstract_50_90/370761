A comparative study of investigations from 1970 (before the prohibition against therapeutically used antibiotics as food additives for growth promotion) and from 1978 respectively proves that the prevalence of young pigs and calves with resistant E. coli has increased significantly from 61% to 92% and from 69% to 86% (tables I and II). Figures 1 and 2 show the prevalence of young pigs and calves with antibiotic resistant E. coli with resistance determinants towards sulfonamides, tetracycline, streptomycin, ampicillin, chloramphenicol, neomycin and furazolidone. This shows that the prevalence of young pigs with resistance determinants towards sulfonamides, tetracycline, streptomycin, ampicillin, and chloramphenicol has increased significantly from 1970 to 1978. The same facts apply to the calves. However, the increase in tetracycline resistance is not significant. Neomycin resistant E. coli for both young pigs and calves were only found in 1978. Figure 3 shows the distribution of the number of resistance determinants per young pig and calf with resistant E. coli. The figure shows the significant tendency that the pigs and calves investigated contain resistant E. coli with more resistance determinants in 1978 than in 1970. The distribution of R-factors among resistant E. coli seems to be reduced at first sight but a closer examination establishes that this only goes for R-factor mediated sulfonamide resistance (the experimental conditions may account for this). R-factor mediated streptomycin resistance has increased while R-factor mediated tetracycline resistance was at the same level. On the basis of literature the causes and risks of an increased distribution of antibiotic resistant E. coli are discussed.
