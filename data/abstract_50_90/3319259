The number of P. falciparum malaria cases, contracted in Africa, diagnosed by the department of Parasitology and Tropical diseases of the Pitie-Salpetriere Hospital Group has shown a significant increase in 1985-1986 when compared with the 15 past years (+23%). This fact is related to the spread of chloroquine or amodiaquine resistant falciparum malaria from East Africa (1980-1983: 54%) to Central Africa (1985: 54.5%) and now to a country of west Africa (Benin 1986).
