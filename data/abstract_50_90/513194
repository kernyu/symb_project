The expression of the interferon-induced antiviral state was studied in heterokaryons and cytoplasmic hybrids (cybrids). An autoradiographic assay for the antiviral state, in which the percentage of cells containing vaccinia viral DNA factories was determined, was used. The expression of the antiviral state was dominant in homokaryons and heterokaryons formed by fusion of interferon-treated cells with untreated cells. Cytoplasts derived from treated cells conferred resistance to virus growth on cybrids formed by fusing such cytoplasts with untreated cells. Treatment of L cell x HeLa cell heterokaryons with human interferon or mouse interferon was much less effective in inducing a detectable antiviral state than was similar treatment of parental cells with homospecific interferon. The antiviral state was fully induced when heterokaryons were treated simultaneously with both types of interferon. Cybrids formed by fusing L cell cytoplasts with HeLa cells or HeLa cytoplasts with L cells did not enter a detectable antiviral state after treatment with interferon specific for the cell type of the enucleated parent. However, treatment of cybrids with interferon specific for the cell type of the nucleated parent was effective in inducing a detectable antiviral state.
