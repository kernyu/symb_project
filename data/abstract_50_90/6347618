Cinoxacin is a urinary antibacterial drug closely related structurally to nalidixic acid. It has a spectrum of in vitro antibacterial activity which qualitatively resembles that of the latter agent, covering most common Gram-negative pathogens, excluding Pseudomonas. In acute or recurrent urinary tract infections it has been shown to be at least as effective as nalidixic acid or co-trimoxazole, and in a few studies was as effective as amoxycillin or nitrofurantoin. Cinoxacin appears to be well tolerated and may have a low propensity to induce bacterial resistance during clinical use, although the latter needs further confirmation. Thus, cinoxacin is an effective alternative for treating urinary tract infections due to common Gram-negative pathogens, and its apparently low incidence of adverse effects may offer worthwhile advantages over the related compounds nalidixic and oxolinic acids. Its use as prophylactic therapy in patients with recurrent urinary tract infections is not yet well established, although this appears a worthwhile area for further study.
