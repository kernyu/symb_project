The methicillin resistant strain of Staphylococcus aureus NCTC 10442 when aged in a broth culture at 42 degrees C yielded variants showing responses of sensitivity, dependence and indifference to the antibiotic. These responses and that of resistance in the parent cells were displayed in agar dilution and agar diffusion experiments at 30 degrees C. At 42 degrees C, all four organisms were sensitive to methicillin.
