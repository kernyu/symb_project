A heat-inducible lysis-defective lambda prophage has been integrated directly into the E. coli chromosome at a site (bfe) very closely linked to the ribonucleic acid polymerase mutation rif(d), a dominant rifampin resistance allele. This unusual lysogen has facilitated the isolation of specialized transducing phages conferring rifampin resistance to sensitive cells, and carrying at least the beta subunit gene of RNA polymerase in intact form.
