Attempts to manipulate the level of C16:1 fatty acids in membrane phospholipids were made by using Bacillus subtilis and its protonophore-resistant mutants to test the hypothesis that C16:1 fatty acid levels relate to the bioenergetic properties of the mutant strains. Growth of the three mutants in the presence of palmitoleic acid restored the level of C16:1 fatty acids in the membrane lipids to somewhat above those found in the wild type. The palmitoleic acid was preferentially incorporated into diphosphatidylglycerol (cardiolipin) and phosphatidylethanolamine and was associated with increased levels of these phospholipids. These membrane preparations showed no increase in the levels of free fatty acids. The increase in C16:1 fatty acids achieved by growth in the presence of palmitoleic acid was accompanied by secondary changes in membrane lipids as well as a pronounced diminution in the protonophore resistance of growth and ATP synthesis. Other membrane-associated properties that had been observed in these mutants, e.g., elevated ATPase levels, were not altered coordinately with protonophore resistance and C16:1 fatty acid levels. Growth of the wild type in the presence of palmitic acid caused a modest elevation of the C16:0 of the membrane lipids and a modest increase in the protonophore resistance of growth and ATP synthesis. Growth of the wild type at elevated temperatures, in the absence of fatty acid supplementation, also enhanced its resistance to protonophores. The results support the hypothesis that specific changes in membrane lipid composition underlie the bioenergetic changes associated with protonophore resistance.
