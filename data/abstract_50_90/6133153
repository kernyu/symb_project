254 patients with serious gram-negative bacillary infections were enrolled into a multicentre, randomised, blind clinical trial and treated with tobramycin-ticarcillin or netilmicin-ticarcillin. The two treatment groups were similar as to sex, age, and weight. The mean daily dose of netilmicin (237 mg) was higher than that of tobramycin (211 mg), p less than 0.01, but the mean duration of therapy was longer with tobramycin (9.4 days versus 8.7 days), p less than 0.01. The netilmicin cohort also had more serious underlying diseases, p less than 0.028. Clinical (tobramycin, 93% and netilmicin, 91%) and bacteriological responses (tobramycin, 87% and netilmicin, 89%) were similar. 84 tobramycin and 73 netilmicin patients had serial audiograms. Eighth nerve deficits developed in 10 (12%) tobramycin and two (3%) netilmicin patients, p = 0.037. Drug-related renal dysfunction developed in 5 (4%) of 114 tobramycin patients whose renal function was monitored and in 1 (1%) of 116 netilmicin patients, p = 0.12.
