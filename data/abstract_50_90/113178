The in vitro effects of Bay k 4999 in combination with gentamicin, tobramycin, amikacin sisomicin and netilmicin in bacteriostatic (MIC) and bactericidal (MBC) concentrations were compared using the checkerboard dilution technique against 20 different strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and indole-positive-negative Proteus species. On average 63% of Bay k 4999-aminoglycoside (AG) combinations inhibited Pseudomonas, Proteus and Klebsiella strains additively and/or synergistically in bacteriostatic as well as in bactericidal concentrations as compared to only 14% additive or synergistic activity on E. coli. 35% of the combinations tested proved to be synergistic in K. pneumoniae, 20% in Proteus, 13% in Pseudomonas, but only 5% in E. coli. No significant differences between various Bay k 4999-AG combination effects could be demonstrated.
