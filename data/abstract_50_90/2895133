An outbreak with a strain of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus began in The London Hospital in 1982 and continues to be associated with significant morbidity and mortality. This particular strain, termed epidemic methicillin-resistant S. aureus, is recognized by its characteristic antibiogram, phage-type and plasmid profile. In this outbreak various means of control have been attempted. Sideroom isolation did not curtail spread of the organism and containment was only achieved with the combination of extended screening, mupirocin for treatment of carriage and the use of an isolation ward.
