The growth of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) was examined in two cell lines resistant to aphidicolin by inhibition of infectious progeny production in the presence of the drug. The results reported show that the virus yield, which was severely inhibited by the drug in sensitive cells, was only slightly inhibited in the resistant cell lines. This suggests that the metabolic alteration known to confer resistance to the cell line (that is the altered deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate pool) may also allow viral growth to proceed in the presence of aphidicolin, and that therefore HSV replication at least partially depends upon the host replicative apparatus.
