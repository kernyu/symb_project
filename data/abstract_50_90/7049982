Over a four year period 8 cases of Pseudomonas cepacia (PC) infection were diagnosed in our unit. Two patients developed PC septicemia following the insertion of porcine arterio venous grafts for hemodialysis access. Six developed PC peritonitis whilst on peritoneal dialysis and one a PC urinary tract infection following cystoscopy. Of the three patients who died two were known to have had PC septicemia. This infection was seen in patients whose host defence mechanisms were considerably impaired or when foreign or prosthetic material had been inserted. PC has developed a resistance to most broad spectrum antibiotics and antiseptics and is easily cultured in ordinary media. Prophylactic use of antibiotics such as the cephalosporins in peritoneal dialysis solutions appears to greatly increase the risk of developing serious infection with PC. Early detection and treatment of this unusual organism with appropriate antibiotics is mandatory.
