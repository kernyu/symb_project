Transfer of the broad-host-range resistance plasmids pIP501 and pAM beta 1 from Streptococcus faecalis to Leuconostoc dextranicum and Leuconostoc cremoris occurred between cells that were immobilized on nitrocellulose filters in the presence of DNase. Transfer of pIP501 to Leuconostoc spp. also occurred when Streptococcus sanguis and Streptococcus lactis were used as donors. In addition, transfer of pIP501 and pAM beta 1 was observed from L. cremoris and L. dextranicum transconjugants to S. sanguis and S. faecalis. Expression of the pAM beta 1 erythromycin and pIP501 erythromycin and chloramphenicol resistance determinants was essentially equivalent in donors and transconjugants. Frequencies of transfer generally ranged from 10(-4) to 10(-7) transconjugants per input donor cell. Intrageneric transfer of pIP501 and pAM beta 1 occurred between L. cremoris and L. dextranicum strains in the same approximate range. These data further extend the host range of pIP501 and pAM beta 1 and demonstrate another example of gene transfer in the genus Leuconostoc.
