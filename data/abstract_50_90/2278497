Methodical aspects of developing rational schemes of combined use of antibiotics and immunomodulators are discussed. Chemotherapeutic drugs are synergists of the factors of nonspecific resistance i. e. enzymes, cationic proteins, etc. However, prediction of the effect of both etiotropic agents and immunomodulators on resistance and immunity is rather complicated. A system for estimating efficacy of combined chemo- and immunotherapy based on multifactorial analysis is described. The main steps of the system are the following: choice of the quality criteria, determination of the experimental factors and levels, choice of the experimental design, performance of the experiment, computer processing of the results, construction of a polynomial statistic model and solution of the therapy problems. The method is universal and applicable to any combination of chemotherapeutics and immunomodulators.
