The rates of lactate accumulation and glucose oxidation by the clinic strains of Staphylococcus aureus were determined. The inhibition grade of the glucose oxidation by cyanide indicates that respiratory chain of staphylococci participates in the oxidizing processes. During glucose oxidation the respiratory chain generates the difference of electric potentials -156 divided by -179 mV. The comparative assessment have shown that the antibiotic-resistant staphylococci are characterized by a higher rate of glucose oxidation as well as by value of the greater transmembrane difference of electric potentials.
