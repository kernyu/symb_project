Report of a case of P. falciparum malaria observed in Rwanda. Relapse and positive blood thick smear has been observed 8 days after the beginning of the treatment of the previous fit of fever by chloroquine. Authors recall the resistance criteria fixed by O.M.S. for antimalarial drugs and question wether drug-resistant malaria is not spreading in East-Africa, considering some similar cases reported in the region.
