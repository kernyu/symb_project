Antimalarial activity of tetrandrine was studied using a continuous in vitro culture of Plasmodium falciparum. Experimental results showed that tetrandrine has potent antimalarial effect on both chloroquine sensitive and resistant strains of Plasmodium falciparum. Interestingly, tetrandrine is about three times more potent against the chloroquine resistant strain than it is against the sensitive strain based on their IC50 values, which were 5.09 x 10(-7) M for the sensitive strain and 1.51 x 10(-7) M for the resistant strain. In addition, reversal experiments revealed that tetrandrine cannot reverse chloroquine-resistance, although it has verapamil-like, calcium-channel-blocker activity.
