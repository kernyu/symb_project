Since proteus inconstans turns out to be the causative agent of an increasing amount of hospital infections, studies on this species are necessary. By means of bacteriocines, biochemical reactions and antibiograms 53 strains were subclassified. 47 strains displayed same biochemical properties, 44 strains showed the same antibiogram. By the method on the basis of bacteriocine typing 15 groups were established. The strains with the same biochemical properties and the same antibiograms could be further subclassified. The distribution of the different bacteriocine groups showed that the infections were not due to a single strain. In contrast there were some indices for cross-infections on some stations.
