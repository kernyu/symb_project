Vero and McCoy cell cultures were tested for their susceptibility to Chlamydia psittaci in the presence of several antimetabolites, such as cortisone acetate, cytochalasin B and cycloheximide. Vero cells were more susceptible than the McCoy cell cultures as demonstrated by cytopathic changes, fluorescent antibody activity, and titer of C. psittaci. Although all of the antimetabolites increased these parameters, a mixture of cortisone and cytochalasin B was the most effective.
