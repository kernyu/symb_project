AF 2 (2-(2-furyl)-3-(5-nitro-furyl)acrylamide) was toxic to Chinese hamster V 79 cells and normal human fibroblasts in aerobic media. However, the toxicity of the drug was increased many times by hypoxia. Similarly, the frequency of AF 2-induced azaguanine- and ouabain-resistant mutants of V 79 cells was much higher in hypoxia than under aerobic conditions. Both hamster V 79 cells and human fibroblasts metabolized AF 2 and other nitrofurans rapidly only under hypoxic conditions. Human fibroblasts were more sensitive to AF 2 both under aerobic conditions and in hypoxia than were V 79 cells under similar conditions. The Chinese hamster cells consistently gave survival curves with marked shoulders while human cells did not. Aerobic cultures of fibroblasts derived from xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) patients were markedly sensitive to AF 2 while fibroblasts from two ataxia telangeictasia patients had normal sensitivity. Under hypoxic conditions the sensitivity of both types of cells was increased but the XP line remained 5--10-fold more sensitive than normal or ataxia cells. These results suggest that the DNA lesions produced by AF 2 may be regarded as similar to those produced by ultraviolet light, at least in terms of their repairability in human cells.
