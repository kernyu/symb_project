A revised system for antibiotic sensitivity testing in Sweden was proposed in 1977. The new SIR system has been in sue in almost all Swedish routine bacteriological laboratories since 1979. The SIR system implied 2 main changes: 3 sensitivity groups instead of previous 4 and new breakpoints for the sensitivity groups. The new system is presented in comparison with 3 standardized systems currently in use (NCCLS, ICS and DIN systems).
