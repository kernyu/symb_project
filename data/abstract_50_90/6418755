A recently developed method of drug susceptibility testing of Mycobacterium tuberculosis which measures the evolution of labeled CO2 from [1-14C]palmitic acid (BACTEC 460 system) was compared to three conventional methods. The proportion method of drug susceptibility testing was the standard against which all test results were compared. Indirect drug susceptibility to isoniazid, streptomycin, rifampin, and ethambutol of 245 isolates belonging to the M. tuberculosis complex was determined. In 95% of the cases, results obtained by the radiometric method were available within 1 week, as opposed to 3 to 6 weeks needed in conventional methodology. Overall agreement was 96.4%. Specificity values ranged from 0.98 to 1.0; sensitivity values of 1.0 for rifampin, 0.96 for streptomycin, 0.91 for isoniazid, and 0.18 for ethambutol were obtained. The specificity of the absolute concentration and resistance ratio drug susceptibility testing methods were 0.99 and 1.0, respectively. The sensitivity of the former was higher than that of the radiometric method (0.99 verus 0.92), whereas that of the latter was lower (0.88 verus 0.96). Further testing indicated that the low sensitivity determined for ethambutol may be due to the choice of the critical concentration used, rather than to a shortcoming of the procedure. The radiometric method thus does not significantly differ in reliability from conventional methods of drug susceptibility testing of M. tuberculosis.
