In the mouse system, acquired resistance to Listeria monocytogenes can only be demonstrated after immunization with viable microorganisms. A successful state of immunity cannot be elicited with formalin-killed organisms or bacterial cell-derived products. Viable, serologically cross-reactive organisms (not mouse pathogenic) do not induce a state of immunity as measured by acquired resistance. The duration of immunity, once established, is dose independent, and the absolute interval of its existence is not extended by secondary challenge with large numbers of viable organisms. The decline of immunity in actively immunized animals is not altered by antigenic challenge with formalin-killed cells or cell products. This indicates that the cellular requirements for the development of host resistance are similar for induction as well as maintenance. In vitro measurements of cellular immunity by migration inhibition indicate that formalin-killed organisms as well as cell products were recognized by actively sensitized lymphocytes obtained from immune animals.
