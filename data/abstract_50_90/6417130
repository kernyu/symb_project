The activity of the de novo pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway has been measured in resistant and sensitive murine tumors in vivo following a single intraperitoneal dose of N-phosphonacetyl-L-aspartate (PALA) (400 mg/kg). For these studies, we utilized a gas chromatograph-mass spectrometric technique which enabled measurement of 13C incorporation from 13CO2 into the uracil nucleotide pool (sigma uracil) of tumors in situ. Flux through the de novo pathway was 75-85% inhibited 1 h after PALA treatment in both sensitive (Lewis lung carcinoma) and the resistant (L1210) tumors, but there was a lag time before this inhibition was reflected in reduced sigma uracil pools. The activity of the pathway in the Lewis lung carcinoma tumors remained maximally depressed (5-15% of control activity) for up to 48 h after the dose of PALA. In contrast, flux through the pathway of L1210 tumors remained 80% inhibited for up to 4 h following PALA administration, but recovered to 70% of control activity between 4 and 12 h after PALA treatment. Recovery of the remaining 30% of control activity in the L1210 tumor was at a much slower rate requiring between 12 and 48 h after PALA treatment to regain full activity of the pathway. This recovery of flux through the de novo pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway did not correlate with the measurement of recovery of aspartate transcarbamylase activity in similarly treated tumors. These data argue strongly in favor of the importance of the de novo biosynthetic pathway, rather than salvage mechanisms, for determining in vivo sensitivity or resistance of these tumors to PALA treatment.
