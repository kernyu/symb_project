The sensitivity to 5-fluorocytosine (5-FC), 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and 5-fluorouridine (5-FUri) of 583 strains of C. albicans of human origin shows a relationship between their ecology, their serotype and their sensitivity to 5-FC. The incidence of the primary resistant strains isolated from patients with systemic candidiasis is of 4%, and 88.8% of the resistant strains belong to serotype B. In a closed community of premature infants the only resistant isolate amongst 78 strains recovered during hospitalization also belong to the B serotype and was introduced from outside. African strains of vaginal origin showed a higher incidence (21.6%) of resistance than did the european strains (4.5%) and this resistance was related to the B serotype predominant in the African environment. This raises the problem of the structure of the cell wall in connection with the active sites, the antigenic determinants and the enzymatic equipment.
