Conjugative transfer of RP4 plasmid into Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO at 30 degrees C results in inhibition of growth of plasmid-containing cells. No inhibition of growth of exconjugants takes place under special conditions (usage of minimal M9 medium or incubation at 42 degrees C) and when cells have specific mutations. These mutations were designated as rpm (RP4 maintenance). Some of them render cells resistance to temperate phages of P. aeruginosa. The frequency of transfer of RP4 into PAO1rpm, in comparison with that of transfer into PAO1rpm+, is increased 7-10 times and is equal 0.8-0.9 per a donor cell.
