Spectrum and sensitivity of bacteria were studied at the Surgical (534 positive wound smears) and the Urological Clinics (7879 urine specimens). Krankenhaus Nordwest, Frankfurt/M., during the period of 1969-1971 and in 1973. The most common organisms identified in wound smears were E. coli, followed by Staph. areus, Aerobacter and Proteus species. E. coli were also predominant in urine, but followed by Enterococci, Proteus and Pseudomonas. E. coli, Proteus species and especially Pseudomonas increased in number whereas Enterococci decreased. There was no pronounced increase in resistance to 9 current antibiotics as well as to chemotherapeutics during the observation period which was particularly striking in the case of Ampicillin used on a large scale. The results of our study support the presently employed therapeutic method using bactericidal antibiotics of the penicillin group in strict indications.
