The use of a computer system for an antibiotic review program is described. A commercial system was selected as the software base for the development of the antibiotic use review (AUR) program. The AUR system is composed of three parts: (1) editing and verifying data from the patient's pharmacy profile card, (2) updating the data base, and (3) generation of reports. The system is flexible in its reporting capabilities. Potential functions of the system include identifying patterns of bacterial resistance. The computer system is an efficient tool for the clinical review of antibiotic use in a quality assurance program.
