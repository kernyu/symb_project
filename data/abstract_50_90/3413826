G-banded metaphase chromosomes of Chinese hamster V-79 RJK cells resistant to ethidium bromide (2.5 and 10 mcg/ml) have been analysed. The cells of the first selection step (clone IVerb-2, the 9th passage) revealed definite karyotypical instabilities. Amplifications or, in rare cases, deletions were found in chromosomes Z1 and Z6 which appear to have derived from chromosome 1. The amplified region in chromosome Z6 varied considerably in morphology. The chromosome instability, detected in Z1 and Z6, was reproducible in cells throughout the eight independent clones isolated from clone IVebr-2 under non-selective conditions. The data obtained allow to suggest a genetically conditioned mechanism of the above chromosome instability. In the population of resistant cells on the second step of selection (clone I Vebr-5, the 9th passage) the frequency of the cells with amplification increased up to 100%. The length of amplifications increased in the majority of cells. In the cells of the third step of selection (clone IVerb-10, the 12th passage) with near-tetraploid chromosome composition, besides amplifications some specific rearrangements of chromosomes 2 and 7 (markers Z16, Z17) were revealed. The above rearrangements are indicative of the karyotypical destabilization in the drug resistant cells, and may be evaluated as secondary phenomena casually connected with amplifications found at the earlier steps of selection.
