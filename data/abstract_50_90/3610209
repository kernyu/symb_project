18 neurosurgical patients were given 15 g fosfomycin at 8-hour intervals. Simultaneously serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations were determined periodically over 8 hrs. In patients with noninflamed meninges the CSF-concentrations ranged between 6.48 and 8.98 micrograms/ml. In patients with meningitis the CSF-levels amounted to 20.28 and 39.80 micrograms/ml. For perioperative short-time prophylaxis and postoperative infections in neurosurgical patients therapeutically relevant fosfomycin levels against Staph. aureus und Staph. epidermidis can be achieved.
