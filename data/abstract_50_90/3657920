The quantitative relations of various groups of microbes, the biological properties of lactobacilli in the luminal and mucosal microfloras of the gastrointestine of rats after having received kanamycin and after starvation, of conventional and germfree mice after irradiation and of piglets of different ages were compared. It was revealed that there exists a positive correlation between the mucosal and the lumenal microfloras which remains considerably stable under different conditions. Nevertheless, in case of irradiation or starvation influencing the gastrointestine microflora, the mucosal microflora gets more changed and the translocation of microbes through the mucosa into blood circulation takes place. The mucosal lactoflora of piglets is formed during the first (1-5) days of life on account of microbes with well-expressed antagonistic activity and lysozyme resistance.
