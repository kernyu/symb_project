Three spontaneous derivatives of Streptococcus faecium ATCC 9790, originally isolated as conditionally Triton X-100 detergent-resistant at 25 degrees C, displayed normal penicillin-induced rates of lysis at 37 degrees C but substantially reduced rates of lysis and killing at 25 degrees C. The addition of exogenous unsaturated fatty acids at 25 degrees C restored wild-type penicillin lysis rates.
