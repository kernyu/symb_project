To demonstrate the value of a computer assisted microbiological diagnosis and database system for clinical use, epidemiological aspects of three important infections were investigated: urinary tract, respiratory tract and wound infections. The first two examples presented revealed significant differences in incidence of pathogens between a single patient group and the overall statistic. The third example demonstrates that even within a department susceptibility patterns of staphylococcus epidermidis were changing in dependence of the ward investigated. In the last example the evaluation of susceptibility testing revealed changing patterns of some pathogens during the observation periods. By means of a computer assisted diagnosis and database on file at the moment of diagnosis thus allowing statistical evaluations at every time within a few hours. The clinician provided with actual data concerning his ward or department may administer an empiric therapy according to the real situation. Besides this, automated susceptibility testing may shorten the time required for diagnosis up to 24 h, thus further contributing to a more rational antimicrobial therapy. In conclusion computer assisted diagnosis and automated instruments support the clinician by means of actual epidemiological data and rapid reporting in choosing and controlling antimicrobial therapy.
