Challenge of distal colonic epithelium from Trichinella spiralis-infected guinea pigs with parasite-derived antigen elevated short-circuit current (Isc) for approximately 60 min. The maximum elevation (delta Isc) was approximately 250 microA/cm2 at 5 min after the addition of trichinella antigen. The antigen-induced alterations in Isc were of greater magnitude and duration than those evoked in jejunum. Colonic electrical resistance was transiently reduced after exposure to antigen. There was no significant effect of antigen on electrical parameters of colon from nonimmunized (uninfected) guinea pigs. The antihistamine pyrilamine (10(-5) M) and the prostaglandin synthesis inhibitor indomethacin (10(-6) M) reduced the colonic Isc response to antigen by 40% when used in combination but had insignificant effects when used singly. In contrast, the jejunal Isc response to antigen was totally eliminated by the combined use of those inhibitors. Antigenic stimulation of sensitized colon released histamine and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). However, the histamine released was only about one-tenth that stimulated by antigen in the jejunum, and PGE2 released was only one-tenth of that stimulated by bradykinin in the colon. PGE2 was not released after antigenic stimulation of jejunum. The antigen-induced colonic delta Isc was reduced approximately 50% by either furosemide or tetrodotoxin. Although histamine- and indomethacin-sensitive factors contribute greatly to the mediation of the antigen-induced delta Isc in jejunum, these autacoids contribute to a lesser extent to the antigen-induced delta Isc in guinea pig colon.
