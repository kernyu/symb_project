Experiments with skin allotransplantation on mice showed that 2-fold administration of prodigiozan in a dose of 0.5 mg/kg increased inhibition of transplantation immunity induced by 5-fold administration of prednisolone (50 mg/kg) or its combination in a dose of 30 mg/kg with azathioprin (25 mg/kg). An increase in the resistance of the mice used as the recipients to staphylococcal infection was observed simultaneously. Prodigiozan also lowered development of local infection caused by Proteus vulgaris in the recipients treated with the combination of prednisolone and azathioprin. When azathioprin was administered intraperitoneally 5 times in a dose of 60 mg/kg, the effect of prodigiozan on the transplant survival and animal resistance to infection was not observed. Under the same conditions levamisol in doses of 2.5 mg/kg (per os, 5 times) and 20 mg/kg (intraperitoneally, 10 times) lowered the effect of the immunodepressants within the period of the allotransplant life and slightly increased resistance of the animals to infection.
