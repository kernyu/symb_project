1. The effects of intraportal and hepatic arterial infusion of prostaglandins E1 and E2 on liver function and circulation was studied in fasting chloralose anaesthetized cats. 2. Infusion of the prostaglandins at rates of 0-1, 1-0 and 5-0 mug/kg.min caused a 35-40% increase in bile flow. This may be explained by a decrease in the reabsorption or a secretion of sodium ions by the ductular cells. The canalicular bile production and bile flow. This may be explained by a decrease in the reabsorption or a secretion of sodium ions by the ductular cells. The canalicular bile production and bile acid excretion was not affected by the prostaglandins. 3. Infused at rates of 1-0 and 5-0 mug/kg.min the prostaglandins caused a transient decrease in mean arterial blood pressure and mesenteric vascular resistance. The resistance in the intrahepatic arterioles and low-pressure vessels was not affected. 4. The prostaglandins did not influence the splanchnic uptake of oxygen and ethanol, whereas a slight increase in the splanchnic glucose output occurred. 5. The effects of the two prostaglandins were identical and not related to the route of administration.
