Genetic analysis of cycloheximide-resistant mutants has shown that at least three genes control the resistance to cycloheximide in Podospora anserina and that the antibiotic resistance is recessive to sensitivity. In vitro and in vivo studies of protein synthesis indicated that for two mutants cycloheximide resistance is associated with the ribosomes. For one of these mutants, the elongation step in protein biosynthesis is insensitive to cycloheximide over a wide range of concentration. In this mutant the resistance to cycloheximide is a property of the 60S subunit.
