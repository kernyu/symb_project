Studies carried out on feedlot cattle show Berenil at 7 mg/kg to be the treatment of choice in trypanosomiasis although repeated doses may be necessary. Resistant strains of Trypanosoma (Duttonella) vivax and Trypanosomas (Nannomonas) congolense survived dosages of between 0.5 mg/kg and 1.0 mg/kg of Trypamidium and were cross resistant to Homidium bromide.
