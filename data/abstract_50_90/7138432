Three years after the start of an experiment to assess the merits of thiabendazole (TBZ) treatment of trichostrongylid parasites in weaner sheep, field isolates of Ostertagia spp and Trichostrongylus spp were made from weaner sheep treated under one of three treatment schemes. Treatment frequencies were "nil", "planned" (5 or 6/year) and "regular" (every 3 weeks). In addition an isolate was taken from a group of "tracer" sheep drenched with TBZ every 10 days. Resistance to TBZ was assessed using an in vitro egg hatch assay, pre- and post-treatment faecal egg counts and a controlled anthelmintic efficiency test. Pre- and post-treatment egg counts revealed the presence of TBZ-resistance in field isolates of mixed species. Egg hatch assays indicated a level of resistance for Ostertagia spp which was proportional to the frequency of TBZ treatment. The "planned", "regular" and "tracer" strains of Ostertagia spp had resistance ratios for eggs of 4, 13 and 15 respectively when compared to the "nil" strain. In the anthelmintic efficiency assay treatment with 44 mg kg-1 and 88 mg kg-1 of TBZ removed 82 and 96% respectively of the total Ostertagia burden (adults and larvae) from the "nil" strain and 30 and 75% respectively from the "planned" strain. The same dose rates against the "regular" and "tracer" strains and additional rates of 132 or 176 mg kg-1 against the "tracer" strain failed to reduce the Ostertagia burden significantly. Intestinal Trichostrongylus spp from all isolates were fully susceptible to TBZ at 44 mg kg-1. Levamisole at 7.0 mg kg-1 was highly effective (99% reduction) against the "tracer" strain of Ostertagia.
