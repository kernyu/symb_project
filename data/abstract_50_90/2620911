The phospholipid composition, distribution and metabolism in mono drug resistant mutants towards antitubercular drugs, viz, streptomycin, ethambutol and isoniazid, were investigated. Though their total phospholipid content was not altered significantly, changes were observed in their individual phospholipid content. Reduced biosynthesis and degradation of phospholipids (monitored by pulse and chase technique using [32P]orthophosphoric acid as a precursor) was observed in all the mutants studied. The subcellular distribution of phospholipids revealed accumulation of phospholipids in the cell walls and reduction in cell membranes of the drug-resistant mutants. Similar alterations were seen in individual phospholipids of these subcellular fractions.
