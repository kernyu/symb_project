A transposon, Tn733, encoding the gentamicin acetyltransferase AAC(3) was found on two gentamicin R plasmids of IncW at Hammersmith Hospital. Transposon TN733 has a molecular mass of 5.8 megadaltons and gives a characteristic 2.4 megadalton fragment on digestion with EcoRI. The appearance of gentamicin resistance on a transposon will increase the chances of spread of this gene.
