One hundred thirty six strains of Mycobacteria isolated from patients with genitalia tuberculosis were analysed. Out of them 92 (67.7%) strains were classified as those of human origin, 17 (12.5%) as those of bovine origin, and 27 (19.7%) were referred to as opportunistic. The study of cultural properties, virulence and drug sensibility demonstrated that the genitalia tuberculosis agent featured oligobacillary excretion, relationship between their rapid growth and the nature of material under observation, and multiple inoculation. Mainly low and medium virulence is determined. Overwhelming majority of the cultures show responses to the essential antituberculous drugs.
