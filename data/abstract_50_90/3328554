The incidence of leprosy in Singapore is declining over the past 20 years. More than one third of new cases are now over 50 years while no child under 5 years has been affected since 1970. Male to female ratio is 2:1. Indians are more significantly affected compared to the other races and a higher proportion has tuberculoid leprosy. Tuberculoid leprosy accounts for 50.4% of cases seen during the past decade. Case detections from household contacts is still worthwhile as it accounts for 3% to 13.5% of the yearly incidence of the disease. The first four cases of dapsone resistance was confirmed in 1969. Since then the yearly incidence of clinically diagnosed dapsone resistant cases averaged 2.9 per thousand. Hence, various regimens of multiple drug therapy have been instituted.
