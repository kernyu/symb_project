Various phenotypes of the resistance to aminoglycoside- and peptide-antibodies of Mycobacterium tuberculosis strain H37Rv were produced by single- and/or two-step selection of the parent strain. Mutants obtained by single-step selection with antibiotics were classified into ten phenotypes; one of single resistance, two of triple resistance, three of quadruple resistance, and four of sextuple resistance. There were two kinds of sextuple resistance (high resistance to enviomycin, viomycin, capreomycin, kanamycin, lividomycin). One was isolated from the parent strain by single-step selection and could be eliminated by mutation to isoniazid resistance, the other was obtained by two-step selections and was not eliminated by mutation to isoniazid resistance. Interaction between mutation to streptomycin resistance and mutation to quadruple resistance (4R phenotype) was observed. Streptomycin resistance interfered with the formation of the 4R phenotype and produced a different phenotype, KR instead of the 4R phenotype. The existence of mutation of the 4R phenotype did not usually interfere with mutation to streptomycin resistance, but a small portion of the mutants with the 4R phenotype were altered in their phenotype from 4R to KR after addition of the mutation to streptomycin resistance. This effect of the mutation to streptomycin resistance was not observed in mutants which already had a mutation to klR phenotype (mutation to low concentrations of kanamycin only).
