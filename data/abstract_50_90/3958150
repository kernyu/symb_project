The reliability of the 10-micrograms clindamycin disk was evaluated for susceptibility testing of anaerobes by the aerobic thioglycolate broth disk method. A good correlation between the aerobic thioglycolate broth disk method and the reference agar dilution procedure of the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards was obtained by using a 4-microgram/ml breakpoint. Improved correlation was obtained when the medium of the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards was buffered.
