Fundamental and clinical studies on aztreonam (AZT), a new monobactam antibiotic, were performed in the pediatric field. The MICs of AZT were assessed against the clinically isolated strains in the pediatric infections. AZT showed an excellent antibacterial activity against Gram-negative bacteria, i.e., against E. coli (20 strains), K. pneumoniae (9), P. mirabilis (16), P. vulgaris (5), P. aeruginosa (10), S. typhimurium (4) and H. influenzae (11); the MICs of AZT against the above strains were less than 0.39 microgram/ml, 0.10 microgram/ml, 0.024 microgram/ml, 0.024 microgram/ml, 6.25 micrograms/ml, 0.10 microgram/ml and 0.10 microgram/ml, respectively. However, antibacterial activity of AZT against Gram-positive bacteria was inferior to that against Gram-negative bacteria, i.e., against the strains of S. aureus (16) and S. pyogenes (4), those MICs were more than 400 micrograms/ml and 3.13 micrograms/ml, respectively. Serum concentrations and urinary excretion of AZT were measured in 2 children aged 7 and 11 years after a single intravenous injection at the dose of 20 mg/kg. The mean serum concentration of AZT followed by the injection 62.5 micrograms/ml at 1/4 hour, 28.5 micrograms/ml at 1/2 hour, 16.5 micrograms/ml at 1 hour, 12.0 micrograms/ml at 2 hours, 3.6 micrograms/ml at 4 hours and 1.1 micrograms/ml at 6 hours, respectively. The mean half-life (beta-phase) was 1.24 hours. The mean urinary concentrations after the injection were 5,000 micrograms/ml in 0-2 hours, 1,650 micrograms/ml in 2-4 hours and 611 micrograms/ml in 4-6 hours and the mean urinary recovery rate up to 6 hours was 61.2%. These results in our studies were considered to be comparable with those reported in adults. In our clinical studies, AZT was administered to a total of 14 cases, i.e., acute pneumonia (4 cases), acute pyelonephritis (4), acute enteritis (5) and acute sppurative cholangitis (1). Clinical effect of AZT was excellent or good in 13 cases except fair in 1 case with acute enteritis and the efficacy rate (excellent and good) was 92.9%. With regard to bacteriological effect, all the strains of H. influenzae (3), E. coli (2), P. mirabilis (1) and P. vulgaris (1) were eradicated, but, S. typhimurium (4) was not eradicated. Neither side effect nor abnormal laboratory findings were observed during the study.
