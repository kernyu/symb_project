The incidence of amikacin resistance among gram-negative bacilli isolated at the New York V.A. Medical Center increased from 2.0% to greater than 7% during an 18-month period from January 1980 to July 1981. This increase coincided with a threefold increase in amikacin use at this institution. The amikacin-resistant (AKR) isolates most frequently recovered in 1981 were species of Klebsiella, Serratia, and Pseudomonas. These organisms were recovered from multiple sites, including urine, sputum, wounds, blood, peritoneal fluid, and pleural fluid. The amikacin-modifying enzyme 6'-N-acetyltransferase was detected in 27 (67.5%) of 40 randomly selected AKR isolates. These data indicate that resistance to amikacin in this hospital is enzymatically mediated in most strains of AKR Klebsiella and Serratia and in about one-third of AKR strains of P. aeruginosa. This finding supports the conclusion that amikacin resistance is enhanced by the pressure of increased amikacin use.
