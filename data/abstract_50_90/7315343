In 1979 seven gentamicin (G)-resistant (res.) Staphylococcus aureus strains caused epidemic episodes in eight Danish hospitals. Furthermore, a total of 37 resistant strains were isolated from separate incidents. All the G-res. strains were resistant to kanamycin, sisomicin and tobramycin, five to amikacin and two to cephalothin. None were resistant to netilmicin. Twelve out of the total of 44 strains were multiply-res. (resistant to penicillin, streptomycin and tetracyclines), and 10 of these were also resistant to methicillin (M). All phage groups/complexes were represented, group III by 13, and the 83A complex by seven strains. Multiply-res. strains, resistant to both M and G were all resistant to mercury, but sensitive to arsenate, whereas such strains resistant to either M or G usually have been found resistant to both metals. Twenty-three strains lost resistance to G upon storage, among them only one multiply-res. Loss of resistance did not influence the metal resistance pattern. From one patient only, the various isolates (nine) differed in respect to bacteriological properties. It was concluded, however, that they all were descendants of the same unstable strain. In the majority of the cases treatment with G had preceded isolation of the resistant strain.
