Pefloxacin and ciprofloxacin are two new quinoline carboxylic acid derivatives that have activity in vitro against a wide range of gram-negative bacteria, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Using a well-standardized model of Pseudomonas pneumonia in neutropenic guinea pigs, we tested the efficacy in vivo of these new agents. Both were highly effective in increasing survival and decreasing bacterial counts in the lungs of surviving animals. Pefloxacin and ciprofloxacin were significantly better (P less than 0.05) than aminoglycosides or beta-lactams tested in prior studies with this model, and they were as effective as combination therapy with aminoglycosides and beta-lactams. Resistance to either ciprofloxacin or pefloxacin did not emerge during the study period. Further studies with these drugs in the therapy of Pseudomonas sp. infections are warranted.
