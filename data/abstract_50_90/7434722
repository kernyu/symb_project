The paper presents the results of the studies on the possibility of the development of influenza A virus resistance to effective anti-influenza drugs remantadine and ribavirine in serial passages in cell culture. Influenza virus forms resistant to remantadine were shown to develop quite rapidly. No formation of resistance to ribavirine was observed. The simultaneous presence in the maintenance medium of remantadine and ribavairine prevents the development of influenza A virus mutant resistant to remantadine.
