The efficacy of azlocillin, ticarcillin, and amikacin as single agents and the penicillin/amikacin combinations for treatment of Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteremia during cyclophosphamide-induced severe neutropenia in a rat model were assessed. Equivalent antibiotic dosing was based on the time rat serum antibiotic levels were above the minimal bactericidal concentration for the challenge organism. Antibiotic therapy was administered for 62 hours after bacterial challenge. Antimicrobial efficacy was based on the rate of bacteremia, the emergence of resistant organisms during therapy, life-table survival analysis, and rat survival seventy-two hours after bacterial challenge. For infection with a P. aeruginosa strain susceptible to all study antibiotics, therapy with azlocillin and ticarcillin (given so as to be equipotent) were equivalent, as judged by bacteremia rates or rat survival. However, combination therapy prevented the emergence of organisms resistant to azlocillin, but not to ticarcillin. Amikacin-containing combinations were more effective than single-agent regimens.
