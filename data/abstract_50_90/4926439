The prevalence of Escherichia coli carrying resistance factors (R factors) was examined in meat-consuming individuals and in those not consuming meat (vegetarians and babies below the age of 6 months). Assuming that the transport of resistant E. coli from animals through meat and meat products to the human consumer is most important, with regard to the incidence of resistant E. coli in man, we expected a significant difference in the proportions of people with resistant E. coli between the two groups. However, the percentage with resistant E. coli was larger in the group of vegetarians and babies than in the group of meat-eating individuals.
