Fumarate reductase activity in a thiabendazole-resistant strain of Haemonchus contortus was found to be significantly lower than that from a susceptible strain. However, the fumarate reductase activity in a mebendazole-resistant strain did not differ from that in the susceptible strain, even though it was cross-resistant to thiabendazole. Published reports of fumarate reductase activity in strains of H. contortus susceptible or resistant to benzimidazoles were reassessed. A second, unrelated Australian thiabendazole-resistant strain also proved to have significantly diminished fumarate reductase activity, whereas two American strains, one resistant to thiabendazole and one to cambendazole, possess fumarate reductase activities indistinguishable from corresponding susceptible strains. It therefore appears that the phenomenon of benzimidazole resistance cannot be generally correlated with diminished fumarate reductase activity, although in the specific case of the Australian thiabendazole-resistant strains it may be a contributory factor.
