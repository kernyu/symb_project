The incidence of Listeria monocytogenes (LM) infection has increased in recent years, particularly in immunocompromised patients or in those with severe underlying diseases. However, it still is an unusual pathogen. In the present study we report 14 cases of listeriosis in adults, seen from 1978 to 1988. The organism was isolated from the blood in 10 instances, from cerebrospinal fluid in 5, and from a cervical abscess in one. The ages of the patients ranged from 29 to 81 years and there was a clear male predominance. In all cases except in one there was a previous underlying disease, and four had received immunosuppressant therapy. Listeria monocytogenes was sensitive to ampicillin, erythromycin, vancomycin, gentamicin, rifampicin, ticarcillin, azlocillin, mezlocillin and tetracyclines.
