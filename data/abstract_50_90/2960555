Between April 1983 and December 1985, 576 strains of Neisseria gonorrhoeae were isolated in our laboratory from patients attending Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STD) clinics. Of these, 61 (10.6%) were penicillinase-producing. Studies on these strains by plasmid analysis, auxotyping and serogrouping showed that the predominant type strains harboured the Asian resistance plasmid, were prototrophic, and were of serogroup W II/W III. About half of the strains, both of the African and Asian type, harboured the transfer plasmid. Strains of serogroup W II/W III were less sensitive to tetracycline and cefoxitin than serogroup W I strains.
