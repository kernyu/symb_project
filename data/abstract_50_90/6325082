Detecting changes in viral antigen by immunoperoxidase staining of infected cell monolayers was extended to antiviral susceptibility testing. The same endpoints of viral replication, in the presence of acyclovir, were obtained by staining monolayers by immunoperoxidase at 18 hr as by a 72-hr cytopathic effect assay. Levels of acyclovir effectively reducing viral replication by 50% when determined by estimation of reduction in replication of herpes simplex virus or derived from dose-response curves, were comparable for a number of herpes simplex virus isolates from genital sources. Overall, the immunoperoxidase staining method is more rapid, applicable to a broader range of virus groups, complements rapid detection and confirmation techniques, is readily adaptable for use in the diagnostic virology laboratory, and is potentially automatable .
