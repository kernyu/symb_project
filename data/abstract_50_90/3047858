Since 1973, when doxycycline was introduced as preoperative prophylaxis in elective colorectal surgery at Malmo General Hospital, Sweden, there has been an unchanged and low rate (8% to 12%) of septic complications in colonic surgery. For treatment of postoperative infections, ampicillin and cefuroxime have been used since 1973 and 1980, respectively. The sensitivity of Escherichia coli to these three antibiotics used for prophylaxis and treatment was followed for five years (1981-1985). Only minor changes were observed during the period. A lower frequency of antibiotic resistance was found in bacterial strains isolated peroperatively than in strains isolated postoperatively after colorectal surgery or from infections in other patients. Considering the low frequency of postoperative infectious complications and the low frequency of antibiotic resistance in peroperative isolates, doxycycline still remains an alternative for prophylaxis in bowel surgery.
