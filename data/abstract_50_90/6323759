Recombinant viral genomes carrying a selectable drug resistance marker have been constructed by insertion of a hybrid gene for neomycin resistance into the helper-independent adenovirus vector, delta E1/X. The hybrid gene consists of sequences coding for the aminoglycoside 3'-phosphotransferase II from Tn5, under the control of the simian virus 40 early promoter, and renders mammalian cells resistant to the neomycin analog, G-418. Most of adenovirus early region 1 is deleted from delta E1/X (nucleotides 455 to 3330), and recombinant viral genomes carry the hybrid gene in its place. The large and small XbaI fragments of delta E1/X were ligated to the hybrid gene, and the mixture was transfected into 293 cells. Single plaques were isolated and subsequently passaged in 293 cells to produce virus stocks. The recombinant viruses efficiently rendered cultured rat (Rat2) and simian (CV1) cells resistant to G-418. Cloned cell lines selected for resistance to G-418 contained viral DNA integrated into the host cell genome, demonstrating that early region 1 is not essential for integration of the viral genome. Southern transfer experiments revealed that (i) the sites of integration in the host genome were not unique; (ii) in general, transformed CV1 cell lines contained single-copy, full-length viral genomes, colinear with the infecting virus; (iii) transformed Rat2 cell lines generally contained one to several copies of full-length viral genomes integrated colinearly with the infecting viral DNA; and (iv) three of these five lines of transformed Rat2 cell lines contained tandemly repeated viral DNA sequences in which the right and left ends of the viral genome were joined to each other.
