The in vitro activities of 39 antimicrobial agents were assessed versus 74 clinical isolates of Branhamella catarrhalis. Resistance was observed only with penicillin and ampicillin and then only with beta-lactamase-producing strains. The results of in vitro susceptibility tests with agar dilution and broth microdilution procedures were found to be comparable. The results of broth tube macrodilution tests were, in general, one twofold-concentration increment higher.
