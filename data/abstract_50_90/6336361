A total of 85 strains of nontyphoid Salmonella isolated in Buenos Aires during the period 1978-1982 from animal products, were examined for susceptibility lo 11 antimicrobial agents, by the agar dilution n method. Only 23.5% of the strains were resistant to ampicillin, cefalotin, streptomycin, or sulfisoxazole. All the strains were sensitive to chloramphenicol, tetracycline, gentamicin, amikacin, kanamycin, tobramycin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Multiply resistant strains were not found, except the only isolate of S. oranienburg that was found resistant to streptomycin and sulfisoxazole. Ampicillin- and cefalotin-resistance were found in five strains of S. infantis. These resistances might be due to the activity of one beta-lactamase.
