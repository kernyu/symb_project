The A. examined 525 biologic samples that reached the Laboratory for normal bacteriological research. From those samples 625 bacterial species have been isolated, which have been tested with six antibiotics of commoner use, according to the method of Kirby-Bauer, employing two sorts of medium, the Mueller-Hinton Agar and the Brain Heart Infusion Agar. From these sensitivity-tests there resulted a very high rate of antibiotic resistance to of the six antibiotics examined. Several reasons have been invoked to explain the phenomenon but the most plausible explanation is that, it is due to the genetic modifications that the bacteria have undergone.
