The efficacy of ticarcillin (100 mg/kg), tobramycin (1 mg/kg), and rifampin (43 and 7.2 mg/kg) individually and in combination was assessed in neutropenic mice infected with an LD90 of one of four Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates. The study end point was survival at 120 hours after infection. Treatment with the triple combination, ticarcillin plus tobramycin plus rifampin (43 mg/kg), was significantly superior to the double combination of ticarcillin plus tobramycin (p less than 0.01). Although treatment with rifampin (43 mg/kg) alone yielded results similar to treatment with the triple combination in mice infected with three of the four isolates, rifampin-resistant mutants (minimal inhibitory concentration greater than 1000 micrograms/ml) of P. aeruginosa were frequently isolated from surviving mice (26% of mice sampled). In contrast, in mice treated with the triple combination, rarely were rifampin-resistant mutants isolated (3% of mice sampled). Rifampin alone was active against P. aeruginosa isolates only when peak serum concentrations of rifampin exceeded the rifampin minimal bactericidal concentration of the infecting isolate. The addition of rifampin to a "standard" therapy of antipseudomonal penicillin plus aminoglycoside may be useful in the treatment of serious P. aeruginosa infection.
