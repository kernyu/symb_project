Bacteriophage-resistant mutants isolated and classified in a previous study were examined for alterations in their lipopolysaccharide (LPS) composition, and properties likely to be affected by alterations in LPS composition were studied. It was found that many of the mutants of the Ktw (K2-resistance), Ttk (T2, T4, or K19 resistance), Bar (bacteriophage), Wrm (wide-range mutants), and miscellaneous resistance groups were altered in their response to a series of antibiotics and to two LPS-specific bacteriophages, C21 and U3. Furthermore, many of the bacteriophages to which these mutants were resistant adsorbed to LPS preparations. By direct sugar analysis of the mutant LPS preparations, it was shown that the mutants fitted into six distinct classes, which are readily derived from LPS core with a structure resembling that of Salmonella or Escherichia coli O100. A number of the mutants were shown to map between pyrE and mtl, which has been previously shown to be the site of a cluster of rfa genes in both Salmonella and E. coli. Outer membrane protein composition was studied in the above mutants using polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Some strains were shown to have alterations in the amount of major proteins. The nature of the bacteriophage receptors involved and the alterations leading to resistance are discussed.
