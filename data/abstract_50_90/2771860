New quick-acting blood schizontocides are needed to contain the spread of multiple drug resistant strains of P. falciparum and for the treatment of the cerebral malaria cases. A multiple drug resistant strain of P. yoelii nigeriensis resistant to mefloquine (128 mg/kg x 6 days), quinine (300 mg/kg x 7 days) and chloroquine (64 mg/kg x 8 days) was found to be completely susceptible to arteether (a 30:70 mixture of alpha and beta enantiomers) and a dose of 5 mg/kg x 3 days by i.m. route was curative in Swiss mice. Artemisinin at 50 mg/kg x 7 days had only suppressive action against this strain.
