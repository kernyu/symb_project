The growth of Chinese hamster ovary cells in medium containing reduced concentrations of threonine is inhibited by borrelidin, a macrolide antibiotic. Borrelidin-resistant clones have been isolated after ethyl methanesulfonate mutagenesis. One clone, 1C-1, has a 3-fold increased level of threonyl-tRNA synthetase [L-threonine:tRNAThr ligase (AMP-forming), EC 6.1.1.3] as determined by both activity measurements and antiserum titrations. The levels of four other aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases and of tRNAThr are the same in strain 1C-1 and in the wild-type parent. The phenotype of increased threonyl-tRNA synthetase activity is recessive to wild type in cell hybrids.
