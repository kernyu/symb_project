The bactericidal activity of mouse macrophages with different sensitivity to Salmonella infection has been studied. The sensitivity of BALB/c mice to S. typhimurium infection is associated with the low bactericidal activity of their macrophages. The introduction of interferon stimulates the bactericidal activity of macrophages sensitive to Salmonella infection of mice, which sharply enhances the resistance of the animals to this infection.
