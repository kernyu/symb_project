A bacterial phospholipid extract (EBP) inoculated intraveinously at a dose of 1 mg/25 g body weight 30 hours before infection protects mice against the lethal effect of Frog Virus 3 (FV 3). The anti-FV 3 resistance produced by EBP requires protein synthesis during the period of pretreatment. The treatment with the bacterial extract has no effect on the inhibition of the macromolecular synthesis of the liver (RNA and DNA) which is observed at the beginning of the infection. However 48 hours after FV 3 infection, there is a notable stimulation of DNA synthesis which probably corresponds to liver regeneration.
