We report here a novel system for the conjugal transfer of bacterial chromosomes which utilizes the transfer origin (oriT) of plasmid RK2 cloned into transposon Tn5. Tn5 with oriT was inserted by transposition into the chromosomes of Escherichia coli and Rhizobium meliloti. The oriT sequence then served as the origin of high-frequency chromosome transfer when a helper RK2 plasmid was present in the same cell. The broad host range features of RK2 make this system of oriented chromosome mobilization applicable to most gram-negative bacteria.
