The indications and methods for sensitivity testing of mycobacteria, fungi, anaerobes, and other fastidious bacteria are described in a study which is part of a series on sensitivity testing (this journal, 1984; 114: 1079-1086 and 1987; 117: 509-517). Since these tests are rarely indicated and involve methodological problems, they are best performed by larger laboratories or by reference units.
