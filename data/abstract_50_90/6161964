In a previous study, it was demonstrated that T cells from adult individuals were able to suppress the transformation of B cells after infection by EBV. In this paper, it is shown that this suppression is mediated by interferon. Thus, the suppression is abrogated by anti-interferon serum and mimicked by human leukocyte interferon. Furthermore, the interferon is released in response to the virus-infected B cell, not the virus alone. The relevance of these results to previous clinical evidence, indicating a role for interferon in recovery from EBV infection, is discussed. Interferon will also suppress the transformation of adult B lymphocytes by the mitogen phytohemagglutinin (PHA). However, interferon at concentrations 2 to 3 orders of magnitude higher was unable to suppress the transformation of neonatal B lymphocytes by either EBV or PHA. These experiments suggest that EBV and PHA induced transformation share a common interferon sensitive step. Lastly, the resistance of newborn lymphocytes to the protective effect of interferon may be an important consideration in the application of interferon as an antiviral or anti-tumor agent.
