Biological properties and sensitivity of 6 Corynebacteria strains to 9 antibiotics were studied in vitro. The rate of the development of resistance to neomycin, levomycetin, decamine and decamethoxin in the diphtheria causative agents was determined. Biological properties of the decamethoxin resistant variants of the diphtheria causative agents were investigated: 100 passages on media with increasing amounts of the drug. The rate of the development of resistance to decamethoxin was slower than that to neomycin, levomycetin and decamine. Changes in the biological properties and antibiotic sensitivity of the decamethoxin-adapted strains were revealed.
