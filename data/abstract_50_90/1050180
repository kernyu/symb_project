The effect of benzylpenicillin, streptomycin and tetracycline on the animal resistance to infection caused by the antibiotic resistant staphylococci was studied. It was found that the effect of the antibiotics on the infectious process outcome was not limited by their antibacterial properties. Changes in the natural resistance of the host under the effect of the antibiotics were not always the same and depended on both the antibiotic type and the moment of its administration.
