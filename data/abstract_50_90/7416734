The capacity of polyenic antibiotics, such as water soluble forms of amphotericin B, mycoheptin, nystatin and levorin to stimulate immunogenicity and interferonogenic activity of inactivated antiviral vaccines was shown. The protective effect of the vaccine against rabies or forest-spring encephalitis in albino mice was more pronounced on its two-fold use in combination with the antibiotic than that on its use alone. The most significant results were obtained with highly diluted vaccines supplemented with amphotericin B. In this case the resistance index was 2 times higher than on vaccination without amphotericin B. In comparative assays of 4 various lots of vaccines against rabies the ED50 of every inactivated vaccine corresponded to thrice as low levels of the antirabies antigen than on vaccination without the polyen. The problems of the mode of action of the polyenic antibiotics and antiviral inactivated vaccines used in combination are discussed.
