Sodium and potassium intracellular concentration, rate constants of sodium and potassium and rubidium influx were determined for cultured CHO-K1 cell lines, both sensitive and resistant to ethidium bromide. The emission technique was used to measure cation fluxes into potassium and sodium-free magnesium medium. Ethidium bromide sensitive and resistant cell have similar potassium concentrations, whereas sodium concentration in the latter is by almost 2.5 times higher than that in the former. A wide range of changes both in ouabain-sensitive and ouabain-resistant fluxes was found in resistant cells: the ouabain-inhibited rubidium influx is by 3-5 times lower, the ouabain-sensitive sodium efflux is practically absent, and ouabain-inhibited potassium efflux appears. In resistant cells the ouabain-insensitive influx of rubidium is decreased by almost 2 times. It is assumed that the selection of cells for resistance to ethidium bromide is accompanied by ":pleiothypic" changes of cell membrane, involving both active and passive cation transport.
