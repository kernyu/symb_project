82 candida strains isolated from clinical material were tested for their sensitivity to nystatin, 5-fluorocytosine (5-FC) and to clotrimazole. Strains were showing high M.I.C. values against nystatin and 45% primary resistance to 5-FC by the tube dilution technique. No resistance was noted to clotrimazole. The resistance, developed in candida strains against several antifungal drugs, will establish the problem encountered in the antibiotic treatment of bacterial infections. Also the necessity of the sensitivity tests with the isolated candida strains in candida infections is emphasized.
