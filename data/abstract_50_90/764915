The length of a course of antibiotic treatment for urinary tract infection varies with the habits of the prescriber. Many patients do not complete a course of treatment once their symptoms have subsided. In uncomplicated urinary tract infection among women seen in general practice a three-day course of amoxycillin was as effective as a 10-day course of the same drug in the same dose. Relief of symptoms was equal in both groups and bacteriuria was eliminated equally successfully in both regimens. There was no significant difference between the two groups in the incidence of side effects from the drugs. The financial saving which could accrue from adopting this therapeutic regimen would be significant.
