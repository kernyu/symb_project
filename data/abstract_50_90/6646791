Josamycin, one of the more recent macrolide antibiotics, was evaluated in 29 children aged from 2 months to 13 years with bronchopulmonary or otorhinological disease. With a daily dose in the range 30 to 60 mg/kg bodyweight, and an average treatment period of 7.7 days, 24 children were cured and 5 markedly improved. In only 4 children were minor side effects, such as gastrointestinal disturbances, observed, which in no case necessitated interruption of therapy. By virtue of its spectrum of activity josamycin seems to be an ideal antibiotic for the treatment of bacterial respiratory tract infections. In addition, josamycin displays a high degree of activity against mycoplasmas and chlamydiae. Only a very low percentage, reported as 6%, of staphylococcal are primarily resistant to the antibiotic, and the rapid development of resistance to other macrolides, has not been reported for josamycin. No cross resistance exists between josamycin and penicillins, cephalosporins, tetracycline or aminoglycosides. These characteristics represents josamycin for the treatment of respiratory tract infections. The pleasant taste of the preparation used in this study ensured its ready acceptance by the children treated.
