Fundamental and clinical evaluation of ceftriaxone (Ro 13-9904, CTRX) was performed in the pediatric field. Antibacterial activity The MIC80 of CTRX against clinical isolates such as S. aureus (23 strains), S. pyogenes (23 strains), E. coli (20 strains), K. pneumoniae (23 strains), H. influenzae (15 strains) and P. aeruginosa (23 strains) were 6.25 micrograms/ml, 0.024 microgram/ml, 0.20 microgram/ml, 0.05 microgram/ml, less than or equal to 0.006 microgram/ml and 12.5 micrograms/ml, respectively. The antibacterial activity of CTRX was therefore poor against S. aureus and P. aeruginosa, but quite excellent against S. pyogenes, E. coli, K. pneumoniae and H. influenzae. Compared with cefotaxime (CTX), cefoperazone (CPZ), cefmetazole (CMZ), cefazolin (CEZ) and ceftazidime (CAZ), CTRX was the highest in the antibacterial activity against H. influenzae, next to CTX against S. pyogenes, E. coli and K. pneumoniae, similar to CTX, CPZ and CAZ against S. aureus and similar to CTX against P. aeruginosa. Absorption, Excretion The mean serum levels of CTRX after an intravenous one shot injection with about 20 mg/kg in 3 children aged 10 to 14 years were 160.0 +/- 23.3 micrograms/ml after 1/4 hour, 134.3 +/- 27.5 micrograms/ml after 1/2 hour, 115.0 +/- 33.2 micrograms/ml after 1 hour, 95.3 +/- 28.4 micrograms/ml after 2 hours, 75.3 +/- 14.5 micrograms/ml after 4 hours, 30.3 +/- 13.5 micrograms/ml after 12 hours and 8.2 +/- 3.1 micrograms/ml after 24 hours, while the half-life time was 5.92 +/- 0.43 hours on the average. The mean urinary levels were 1,060 +/- 461 micrograms/ml from 0 to 2 hours, 309 +/- 122 micrograms/ml from 2 to 4 hours, 375 +/- 83 micrograms/ml from 4 to 6 hours, 237 +/- 77 micrograms/ml from 6 to 12 hours and 122 +/- 23 micrograms/ml from 12 to 24 hours, the mean urinary recovery rate up to 24 hours being 38.9 +/- 13.6%. The concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid The mean levels of CTRX in the cerebrospinal fluid of the patients with purulent meningitis were 4.30 +/- 4.22 micrograms/ml 1 hour after an intravenous one shot injection with 42 to 51 mg/kg, 4.64 +/- 3.53 micrograms/ml after 3 1/2 hours to 6 hours, 3.79 +/- 2.15 micrograms/ml after 7 1/2 hours to 12 hours and 1.79 +/- 0.23 microgram/ml after 19 hours.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
