The inhibiting activity of ovotransferrin was tested towards different species belonging to genus Candida. Of one hundred strains tested, only C. krusei showed a noticeable resistance, while the other species appeared to be more sensitive than bacteria to the action of ovotransferrin. The influence of anions, such as bicarbonate and citrate, on the inhibiting activity of ovotransferrin was also investigated. Moreover it was observed that iron saturated ovotransferrin retained its activity, thus suggesting an interaction between the protein and Candida cells.
