Moxalactam (latamoxef) is a new synthetic oxa-beta-lactam antibiotic administered intravenously or intramuscularly. It has a broad spectrum of activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, is particularly active against Enterobacteriaceae and is resistant to hydrolysis by beta-lactamases. Moxalactam has moderate activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but on the basis of present evidence can not be recommended as sole antibiotic treatment of known or suspected pseudomonal infections. Like the related compounds, the cephalosporins, moxalactam is effective in the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections and lower respiratory tract infections caused by Gram-negative bacilli. As moxalactam is also active against Bacteroides fragilis it has considerable potential in the treatment of intra-abdominal infections in patients with normal immunological mechanisms, as well as in immunocompromised patients, when used alone or in combination with other antibiotics. Likewise, its ready penetration into the diseased central nervous system, its high level of activity against Gram-negative bacilli, and the lack of necessity to monitor drug plasma concentrations, indicate its potential value in the treatment of neonatal Gram-negative bacillary meningitis. Further clinical experience is needed before it can be determined whether moxalactam alone can be used in the treatment of conditions for which the aminoglycosides are drugs of choice, but if established as equally effective, moxalactam has the advantage of being devoid of nephrotoxicity. Bleeding is a potentially serious problem, however, particularly in the elderly, malnourished and in the presence of renal impairment.
