Elucidation of antibiotic resistance correlation with manifestation of the pathogenic properties and aggressiveness in particular is of definite importance. Because of a wide spread of antibiotic resistance among staphylococci and ever increasing in pathology the role of S. epidermidis, the changes in penetration of the internal organ tissues, activity and intensity of capture and digestion by phagocytes of S. epidermidis mutants D-5/240 carrying the chromosome markers of penicillin and erythromycin resistance were analyzed. It was shown that the chromosome markers of the antibiotic resistance in staphylococci promoted their more active penetration into the tissues of the internal organs, affected permeability of the cell membranes, changed the activity of the digestion enzymes in the phagocyting cells (lowering the number of the acid phosphatase), prevented phagocytosis completeness and decreased the microorganism immunogenic properties.
