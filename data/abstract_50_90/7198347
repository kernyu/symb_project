Whilst Staphylococci isolated from goats may possess "bound" coagulase, they do not seem to produce "free" coagulase. Of the 85 isolates that gave positive slide-coagulase test with human plasma, only 13 (15.3%) gave positive tube-coagulase tests. When goat's plasma was used, 78 isolates gave positive slide-coagulase test and 9 (10.3%) gave positive tube-coagulase tests. 16 (13.22%) of the isolates which showed complete haemolysis on human blood agar, gave positive slide-coagulase tests. The 120 isolates obtained from clinically healthy and sick goats were tested for sensitivity to 12 chemotherapeutic agents. They were most sensitive to kanamycin, cephaloridine and ampicillin. Resistance to tetracycline and streptomycin was prominent. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of on the antibiotics to which the isolated were resistant ranged from 500, 250, 125 to 0.0448 mcg/ml for streptomycin and chloramphenicol whilst the (MIC) of the isolates for tetracycline and penicillin G ranged from 5.0, 2.5, 1.25 to 0.009 mcg/ml and units/ml respectively.
