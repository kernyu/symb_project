Intradermal injection of cell walls or cell wall constituents (Peptidoglycane) of Streptococcus sanguis II in experimental animals caused a similarly severe inflammatory reaction as with Streptococcus A. The three "viridans" species of streptococci proved to be resistant to complement (active serum) as well as to lysozyme and were superior to Streptococcus A in their capacity for resistance to another type of muralytic enzyme isolated from Streptomyces albus. The new acylureido penicillins (Mezlocillin, Azlocillin) had an almost equally inhibitory effect on the growth of the various species of bacteria. The "viridans" and beta-haemolytic types of streptococci which induce a chemotactic reaction in vitro were about equally rapidly and effectively killed in the phagocytes (granulocytes, monocytes) isolated from a patient.
