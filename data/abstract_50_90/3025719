The technique of localized in vitro mutagenesis in the cohesive ends of plasmid pBR322 DNA has been elaborated (separately for BamHI and HindIII sites). Plasmid DNA digested by restriction endonucleases has been treated with sodium bisulphite deaminating cytosine to form uracil in single stranded DNA (cohesive ends of the plasmid). The mutagenized plasmid DNA, free of mutagen, has been treated with bacteriophage T4 ligase. E. coli C600 cells were subsequently transformed by the ligated DNA preparation. The clones having tetracycline gene mutagenized represented 4.0-11.1% and 1.2-3.1% among HindIII and BamHI mutants, respectively, selected as TcR----TcS transformants. Selection of mutagenized DNA by the second endonuclease restriction has increased the mutant yields up to 55.6-78.0% and 10.0-75.4%, respectively. The yield of TcS mutations in the control DNA treated at all stages of experiment, except for mutagen treatment, has reached 0.06% and 0.2%, respectively.
