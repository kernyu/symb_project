In blood of patients with diabetes mellitus receiving bucarban or adebit antibodies to these drugs were discovered. Patients medicated with bucarban demonstrated an elevated content of antibodies to insulin. The appearance of specific antibodies occurred in rabbits and rats following introduction of bucarban, glucophage or adebit per se or when mixed with adjuvants. An increased production of antibodies to endogenous insulin was observed in all animals reveiving bucarban. Introduction to rats of inactivated (at 56 degrees C for 30 minutes) serum of patients with diabetes mellitus that contained antibodies to bucarban or adebit as well as immune rabbit sera greatly mitigated the hypoglycemic effect of the latter. Introduction to rats of the blood serum taken in patients reveiving bucarban allso attenuated the effect of exogenous insulin. These findings suggest that, possessing neutralizing properties, these antibodies to bucarban, adebit and glucophage cause habituation to these substances. Accumulation in the blood of autoantibodies to insulin following introduction of bacarban reduces the sensitivity to the exogenous hormone and manifests the existence of an immune mechanism securing the preservation of chemical homeostasis in the organism.
