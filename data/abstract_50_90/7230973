The clinical efficacy of the prophylactic use of cephradine was evaluated prospectively in 118 women who underwent cesarean section. The patients of the cephradine group had a significantly lower (p less than 0.01) postoperative morbidity rate (17.79%) as compared with the control group (51.06%). The mean hospitalization time was also significantly shorter (p less than 0.01) in the cephradine group (7.2 +/- 0.13) than in the control group (10.9 +/- 0.23). Cephradine was proved to be an effective antimicrobial agent for chemoprophylaxis, due to its wide antimicrobial spectrum, beta-lactamase resistance, low percentage protein binding, large volume of distribution and non metabolic degradation.
