The comparative release of periplasmic enzymes and proteins from two strains of Serratia marcescens by osmotic shock and polymyxin B treatment was studied. There were significant qualitative and quantitative differences in the materials released by these two techniques. The osmotic shock procedure released a higher level of alkaline phosphatase activity and a greater number of protein components than the polymyxin B treatment. The molecular weights of the active components released by the two techniques were shown to be 190,000 +/- 10,000 (A'), 140,000 +/- 10,000 (A) and 110,000 +/- 10,000 (B) daltons. Components released by polymyxin B were also released by osmotic shock. However, the reverse was not true. Component B in the osmotic shock fluids was by far the most active. The differences in the release mechanisms of the two techniques were discussed. It is suggested that polymyxin B treatment is the method of choice because of its selectiveness and mildness, despite the rather low level of activity of alkaline phosphatase released.
