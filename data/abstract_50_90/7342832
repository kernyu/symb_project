Eight antiseptics to be used in footbaths for cattle, were compared : formol, cuprum sulphate, formol associated with cuprum sulphate, Javel water, Cresyl and some other products more recently introduced into practice. For each one, evolution of antibacterial activity connected with utilization on animals, moistening power and possible injury caused were observed. The best results have been obtained with formol, formol associated with cuprum sulphate and Cresyl which have exhibited persistent high level antibacterial activity without related injury in spite of numerous applications. On the other hand, weak organic matter resistance which seems to characterize Javel water, synthetic phenols, amphoteric amino acids and iodophores makes them unsuitable for use in footbaths.
