The epidemiology and therapy of 29 episodes of bacteremia caused by oxacillin- and aminoglycoside-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (OARSA) were compared with 29 episodes of bacteremia due to oxacillin-sensitive S. aureus (OSSA) that occurred during a 36-month period. Patients with bacteremia due to OSSA were younger (P less than 0.05) and were admitted more frequently with acute traumatic injury (P less than 0.01). The overall survival rate one month after persistent bacteremia was 74% for patients with OARSA bacteremia treated with vancomycin compared with 70% for patients with OSSA bacteremia treated with a beta-lactam antibiotic. The results indicate that vancomycin is an effective antibiotic for the treatment of bacteremia caused by OARSA and suggest that its effectiveness is comparable to that of beta-lactam antibiotic treatment of bacteremia due to OSSA.
