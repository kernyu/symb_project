The composition of lipid and protein components of the membrane structures was studied in the strains of Candida albicans susceptible and resistant to polyene antibiotics. The content of sterols was lower and the content of free fatty acids was higher in the cells of resistant strains cf. susceptible strains. The composition of sterols was also different in the resistant strains: analysis of absorption spectra of sterol extracts in heptane in UV revealed complete absence of ergosterol, the main component of the susceptible strain, and appearance of a heterogenous peak at 215--240 nm.
