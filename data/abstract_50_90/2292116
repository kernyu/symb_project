This study observed the effect of chemotherapy combined with Chinese herbs and western drugs on white blood cell count in 31 patients with gastric cancer. These patients were divided into 3 groups: (1) Fu Zheng (strengthen the body resistance) with invigorating the Spleen and Kidney recipe; (2) Fu Zheng with western drugs raising WBC and enhancing immunity; (3) Gong Xiao (eliminating the evil factors and mass) with promoting blood circulation to remove blood stasis recipe or eliminating the evil factors and mass recipe. After chemotherapy, the mean of WBC count was greater than 4.0 X 10(9)/L in group I; less than 3.5 X 10(9)/L in group II; less than 3.0 X 10(9)/L in group III. Because of WBC count below 3.0 X 10(9)/L, in group II there were 5 cases (5/14) whose chemotherapies had to be discontinued, and in group III there were 4 cases (4/6). While all patients were completed their chemotherapies in group I. Its statistical difference was significant (P less than 0.05). It suggested that invigorating the Spleen and Kidney recipe had specific effect on decreasing the toxicity and side effect of chemotherapy, preventing bone marrow suppression and leukopenia, and was better than western drugs used in group II. It showed in the treatment of cancer with TCM, we must pay attention to the relationship between the Fu Zheng and the Gong Xiao.
