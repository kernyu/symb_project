Combination with tazobactam substantially enhanced the activity of piperacillin against routine isolates of staphylococci, various Enterobacteriaceae, Acinetobacter anitratus, and Bacteroides fragilis. Tazobactam enhanced the activity of piperacillin more than fourfold against Pseudomonas aeruginosa spp. harboring eight of 12 plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases.
