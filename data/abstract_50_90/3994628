A class of arabinosyladenine-resistant baby hamster kidney (BHK) cell mutants, isolated in our laboratory, shows cross-resistance to deoxyadenosine, alteration of adenosine kinase, elevation of spontaneous mutation rate, and extreme sensitivity to adenosine. One of these adenosine sensitive mutants, ara-s10d, was isolated spontaneously and studies with Ador revertants suggest the involvement of a single pleiotropic mutation. The enhanced adenosine toxicity in ara-s10d cells can be attributed to pyrimidine nucleotide starvation and to at least one other mechanism, which is associated with a 200-fold elevation of IMP, 3-5 fold elevation of ATP, GTP, S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) and methylthioadenosine (MeSAdo).
