Aminoglycoside resistance genes were cloned from transconjugates of aminoglycoside resistant clinical strains of gramnegative bacteria. The resistance determinant cloned from the strains of E. coli transferred kanamycin, monomycin and neomycin resistance to laboratory strains. It was shown that the cloned resistance gene encoded the type I 3'-aminoglycoside phosphotransferase. The results of spot and blot hybridization of the gramnegative bacteria clinical strains with the Bam HI-Pst I fragment of the cloned resistance determinant were indicative of wide-spread distribution of the APH 3' (I) and closely related genes in clinical microbial populations.
