One gram of ceftizoxime (CZX) was administrated before transurethral resection in 38 cases of benign prostatic hypertrophy. Then the serum and tissue concentration of CZX was measured, and compared with the sensitivity of CZX to the bacteria separated from the urine of inpatients. The concentration of CZX in prostatic tissue was higher than the MIC80 for E. coli for 16.7 hr, for Klebsiella for 18.7 hr, for Proteus for 14.7 hr and for Serratia for 8.86 hr. Therefore, CZX was considered to be an effective drug against bacterial prostatitis.
