By its antagonistic function normal microflora provides the intestine with resistance to colonization with exogenic opportunistic and pathogenic microorganisms. The drug was effective in inducing a decrease in the intestine colonization resistance which in its turn leads to filling of free ecological niches with exogenic microflora. In this connection the suggestion that specification of a new chemical agent should include along with other criteria its effect on colonization resistance is valid. It was shown with the use of indicator microorganisms that when administered per os in doses of 40 and 80 mg/kg daily for 3 and 6 days, respectively, a new original compound 1929, a derivative of 5-alkyl-3H-furanones, with high antimicrobial activity induced no significant or more pronounced changes in the colonization resistance of the gastrointestinal tract of noninbred albino mice than furagin used as the reference drug.
