Drug resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains prevalent in the Western Region of Libyan Arab Jamahiriya was studied for the years 1984, 1985 and 1986 at the regional tuberculosis control centre at Gurgi, Tripoli. Records of resistance to streptomycin, isoniazid, ethambutol and rifampicin were analysed. Whereas primary drug resistance was observed in 5.1%, 19.5% and 3.8%, acquired drug resistance was found in 12.2%, 34.0% and 15.3% of the strains in 1984, 1985 and 1986 respectively. Only 3 out of 598 strains (1.2%) were found to show acquired resistance to rifampicin. No primary resistance to rifampicin was observed. The situation of drug resistance in pulmonary tuberculosis in the Jamahiriya is discussed.
