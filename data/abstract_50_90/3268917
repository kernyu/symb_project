This paper reports the results of a study carried out on 4614 samples of urine from inpatients and outpatients according to the sex. The positive monomicrobic urine specimens were examined and isolated strains were tested against various antimicrobial drugs. Our findings showed that 43.1% of urine specimens examined from inpatients and 38.4% from outpatients proved to be positive. Among the bacterial species more frequently isolated, significant differences among Enterobacter spp. in males and coagulase-negative Staphylococcus spp. in females from general practice, and Pseudomonas spp. in females from the hospital were observed. Statistical analysis reveals that: a) no significant differences were found in antibiotic-resistance among Escherichia coli, Proteus rettgeri, Streptococcus faecalis, Enterobacter spp. and Pseudomonas spp., isolated from inpatients and outpatients as regards males and females; b) Klebsiella spp., Proteus rettgeri and coagulase-negative Staphylococcus strains isolated from females inpatients are more chemo-resistant than those from females outpatients.
