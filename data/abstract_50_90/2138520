Activated macrophages synthesize and release numerous tumoricidal soluble factors that can be divided into receptor- or nonreceptor-dependent agents. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) would be an example of the former. In our experimental model the killing of EL4 thymoma cells by syngeneic activated macrophages involves, but not exclusively, TNF. Our results show that approximately 50% of the anti-EL4 activity expressed by macrophages can be specifically inhibited with rabbit anti-mouse TNF antibody. EL4 variants resistant to the lytic activity of TNF were still susceptible to macrophage-mediated lysis. A tumor-promoting phorbol ester, TPA, rendered TNF-sensitive and -insensitive EL4 cells resistant to M phi-mediated lysis. However, TPA down-regulated TNF-specific binding sites on both TNF-sensitive and -resistant cell surface membranes, suggesting that resistance to TNF involves postligand:receptor events. Tumor cell G-protein involvement (ADP-ribosylation), as a result of TNF-TNF receptor interactions, was investigated. The results showed that pertussis toxin was cytotoxic against TNF-sensitive and -resistant EL4 cells but not against TPA-treated target cells. Inhibitors of ADP-ribosyltransferase inhibited pertussis toxin cytotoxicity and macrophage-mediated lysis but did not interfere with recombinant TNF lytic activity.
