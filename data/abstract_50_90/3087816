Two aphidicolin-resistant cell mutants (AC 12 and AC 41) with a fourfold increase in spontaneous frequency of sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs) were obtained out of over 400 aphidicolin-resistant mutants isolated from mouse lymphoma L5178Y cells. They also exhibited three- to fourfold increases in spontaneous frequency of chromosome aberrations (CAs). To determine whether the high level of SCE frequency in AC 12 is caused by 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) used for visualizing SCEs, the effect of BrdUrd incorporated into DNA on SCE induction was analyzed. The SCE frequencies in AC 12 remained constant at BrdUrd incorporation levels corresponding to 2-90% substitution for thymidine in DNA. In addition, the small amount of BrdUrd incorporated into both daughter and parenteral DNA strands in AC 12 had minimal effect on SCE induction. Furthermore, AC 12 and AC 41 were slightly resistant to BrdUrd with respect to the induction of CAs, the inhibition of cell-cycle progression and the decrease in mitotic activity. These findings suggest that the high incidence of SCEs in AC 12 and AC 41 is formed by their intrinsic defects, not by the effects of BrdUrd used. The analysis of SCE frequencies in hybrid cells between these mutants and the parental L5178Y revealed that the genetic defects in AC 12 and AC 41 appear to be recessive, and that these two mutants belong to the same complementation group. Furthermore, AC 12 belonged to a different complementation group from ES 4, which was isolated previously from L5178Y as an SCE mutant with a twofold higher frequency of spontaneous SCEs. This finding indicates that at least two different genetic defects participate in the formation of the high incidence of spontaneous SCEs in mouse cells. These SCE mutants would provide valuable cell materials for studying the molecular mechanism of SCE formation.
