The effect of PSK on the depressed bactericidal activity of macrophages and delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) to Listeria monocytogenes in BALB/c mice bearing transplantable Meth A fibrosarcoma was studied. In tumor-bearing mice pretreated with PSK, L. monocytogenes was cleared rapidly from the circulating blood and bacterial growth in the liver was inhibited effectively in the early phase of infection. This resistance to the infection could be transferred with adherent peritoneal exudate cells (PEC) but not with nonadherent or adherent spleen cells of PSK-treated mice. In the early phase of infection, tumor-bearing mice developed a lower level of DTH to L. monocytogenes than nongrafted control mice. However, the control levels of DTH could be obtained by pretreatment with PSK in tumor-bearing mice. These results suggest that the restoration of DTH to L. monocytogenes by pretreatment with PSK may be attributable to the restoration of the depressed immunological responsiveness to the normal levels in tumor-bearing mice.
