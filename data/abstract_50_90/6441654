287 strains of Neisseria gonorrhoeae isolated in Dakar during a 26 months period (April 1981-May 1983) were sent to Pasteur Institute of Paris for auxotyping. They are distributed in (+): 56%, (PRO-): 21%, (ARG-): 13%, and nine minor auxotypes to the exclusion of (AHU-). Auxotypes distribution according to the sex, the kind of samples and the race do not give proof of significant difference. Monthly distribution shows an endemic circulation of auxotypes (+) and (PRO-), as well as an unstability of auxotype (ARG-) that was prevailing in early months. 22 strains of penicillinase-producing Neisseria gonorrhoeae (among which the first strains isolated in Senegal) belong to auxotypes (+), (PRO-) and (PRO-, ARG-). This distribution does not differ from that of non-producer strains. Gonococcal auxotyping provides an useful epidemiologic marker in order to search after the source of a contamination, to discern a failure of the treatment from a later infection and, on a wide plan, to survey the resistant strains spreading.
