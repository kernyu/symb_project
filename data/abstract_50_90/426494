Sensitivity of 241 Shigella strains isolated from patients at various regions of the USSR in 1975--1978 was tested with respect to 14 antibiotics by the method of serial dilutions. 90.5 per cent of the isolates proved to be resistant to the antibacterial drugs and the greater part of 75.9 per cent of them had multiple resistance. The resistance of the Shigella was most pronounced and frequent with respect to tetracycline, streptomycin, levomycetin, as well as ampicillin and carbenicillin. Gentamicin, cephaloridin, polymyxin M, kanamycin, monomycin, neomycin and rifampicin were highly active against the Shigella. More than 50 per cent of the isolates were sensitive to levomycetin, ampicillin and carbenicillin. Differences in the frequency of the resistant strains and the spectrum of the antibiotic resistance of different Shigella subgroups (species) were observed. The study of 173 multiple resistant Shigella strains showed that about 67 per cent of the strains had a capacity for transduction of the resistance markers into the recipient cells of E. coli. The conjugative R-plasmids were most frequent in Sh. boydii and Sh. sonnei (95 and 95 per cent respectively), less frequent in Sh. flexneri and Sh. newcastle (68 and 53 per cent respectively) and least frequent in the mannitol negative Shigella (25 per cent). The capacity for transduction of R-plasmids in the strains carrying the determinants of resistance to 2 or 3 antibiotics was higher than in the strains carrying the determinant of resistance to one antibiotic. The clinical Shigella strains tested mainly had transmissive R-plasmids of fi--character (79 per cent).
