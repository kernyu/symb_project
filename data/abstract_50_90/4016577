The antibiograms of 408 Salmonella species isolated from large animals were collected during a three year study from 1981 through 1983. The predominant Salmonella serogroup among these isolates was group B. A consistently high percentage of all isolates were resistant to ampicillin and tetracycline. A pattern of increasing resistance to chloramphenicol and gentamicin was documented for serogroup B isolates while the susceptibility of the isolates to neomycin increased. There was a decrease in the incidence of susceptibility to sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim among the group E isolates. These changes were not as remarkable, nor as alarming, as the overall decreased susceptibility to chloramphenicol and gentamicin. An evaluation of the principles concerning use of antimicrobial agents in veterinary medicine for treatment of Salmonella infections is recommended.
