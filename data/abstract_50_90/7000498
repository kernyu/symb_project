To investigate the mechanism of the development of insulin resistance in hypothalamic obesity, we studied insulin binding, glucose transport, and glucose oxidation in adipocytes from ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH)-lesioned rats 1 and 2 weeks after injury. One week after injury, insulin binding and insulin-stimulated glucose oxidation were increased, but insulin-stimulated glucose transport was similar to control. Two weeks after injury, insulin binding and insulin-stimulated glucose transport were similar to control, but insulin-stimulated glucose oxidation was decreased. Thus, cellular insulin responsiveness was increased in adipocytes from VMH-lesioned rats 1 week after injury; this increase in insulin responsiveness was due mainly to the increased intracellular glucose metabolism. On the other hand, cellular insulin resistance existed in adipocytes from VMH-lesioned rats 2 weeks after injury; this insulin resistance was also due mainly to a defect in intracellular glucose metabolism.
