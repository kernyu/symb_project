In matings between Escherichia coli 2492(pJB4JI) and Erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora Ecc71 and E. carotovora subsp. atroseptica Eca12, Kmr Gms transconjugants were obtained at high frequencies, indicating instability of the Mu-containing plasmid pJB4JI and transposition of Tn5 into the recipient genome. This was verified by Southern blot hybridization with pRZ102 DNA containing Tn5 as the 32P-labeled probe. Examination of Kmr Gms transconjugants of Ecc71 and Eca12 disclosed that a proportion (2 to 3%) were either auxotrophic or defective in catabolism of specific carbohydrates. Spontaneous prototrophic revertants were obtained for all markers with the exception of ilv, tyr, and suc. Genetic and physical data indicate that scattered insertions of Tn5 from pJb4JI into the chromosome of Ecc71 and Eca12 produced a variety of altered phenotypes due mostly to single insertions of Tn5 not accompanied by Mu DNA.
