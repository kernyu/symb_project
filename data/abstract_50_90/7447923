It has recently been shown that paromomycin, an antibiotic of the aminoglycoside family, is also active on eukaryotic cytoplasmic ribosomes. In the fungus Podospora anserina, genetic analysis of ten mutants resistant to high doses of paromomycin shows that this resistance is caused by mutations in two different nuclear genes. These mutants display pleiotropic phenotypes (cold sensitivity, mycelium and spore appearance and coloration, cross-resistance to other antibiotics). Double mutants are either lethal or very altered and unstable. Moreover, the cytochrome spectra of these mutants seem to indicate that cytoplasmic protein synthesis is affected. The mutants also display a slight suppressor effect. We can therefore assume that these mutations affect cytoplasmic ribosomes.
