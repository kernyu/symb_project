The maintenance of mtDNA has been examined in human intraspecific hybrid cells constructed from the fusion of HEB7A, a HeLa tumor cell line carrying the mitochondrially coded chloramphenical (CAP) resistance mutation, and GM 2291, a limited lifespan human diploid fibroblast which is CAP sensitive. These two cells can be distinguished by a polymorphism in a site for the restriction endonuclease, HaeIII. Independently isolated clones of hybrid cells were characterized for their growth properties (either normal limited lifespan or transformed and "immortal"). Whole cell DNA preparations were made from each hybrid, digested with HaeIII, and the resultant fragments were detected by hybridization to 32P labelled mouse mtDNA as probe. Experiments with mixtures of HEB7A and GM 2291 DNA reveal that HEB7A mtDNA can be detected when it constitutes as little as 5% of the total cell mtDNA. The results indicate that the HEB7A mtDNA is lost from most hybrids, and when it does persist it is usually a minor component of total mtDNA. The addition of CAP at the time of fusion slightly increases the quantity of HEB7A mtDNA, but not enough to confer CAP resistance. Furthermore, five limited lifespan hybrids contained no detectable HEB7A mtDNA, while three transformed hybrids contained varying quantities of HEB7A mtDNA, suggesting that retention of this tumor form of mtDNA is associated with tumor growth behavior. These results suggest that cytoplasmic genetic incompatibility occurs in intraspecific hybrids.
