The newer beta-lactam antimicrobials offer an expanded spectrum of activity and a similar safety profile compared to their older counterparts. The penicillins appear to be useful in the combination treatment of systemic Pseudomonal infections, and cefuroxime and the third generation cephalosporins may be valuable in the management of meningitis caused by susceptible organisms. However, to avoid the emergence of resistance and to help contain the cost of antimicrobial therapy, these newer agents should be reserved for those clinical situations where older beta-lactams would not be indicated.
