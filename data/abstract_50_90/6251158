A restriction endonuclease cleavage map of the tetracycline resistance plasmid pAB124, originally isolated from Bacillus stearothermophilus, was constructed using ten enzymes. Tetracycline resistance was associated with a 1 x 95 megadalton (Md) region of pAB124 lying between two EcoRI sites, and this region was circularized to produce a viable tetracycline resistance plasmid (pAB224), with two EcoRI fragments of pAB124 deleted amounting to 0 x 95 Md. A second plasmid (pAB524) with one EcoRI fragment (0 x 6 Md) of pAB124 deleted was also constructed. Restriction endonuclease cleavage maps of pAB224 and pAB524 were constructed.
