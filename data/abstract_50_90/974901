The role of macrophages on the course of an infection with Toxoplasma gondii has been examined. Stimulation of macrophage function by killed Bordetella pertussis cells did not show any beneficial effect as an increased susceptibility became apparent. The functional blockade of macrophages by dextran sulfate or carbon particles did not result in a higher susceptibility of mice to the lethal primary infection with T. gondii. Thus in vivo macrophages apparently do not play an essential role as effector cells as they do in infections with other obligate intracellular infective organisms such as Listeria monocytogenes. The spleen is apparently of crucial importance for resistance against T. gondii infection, since death occurred earlier in splenectomized mice than in control animals.
