Following infection by mouse hepatitis virus (JHM strain), an induction of natural killer (NK) cell activity was observed in C3H mice, which are considered to be sensitive to JHM virus infection. In contrast, mice of the resistant SJL strain did not show any increase of NK cell activity after JHM virus infection. However, infection of both SJL and C3H mice with mouse hepatitis virus type 3 (MHV3) resulted in an increase of NK level, comparable to that observed with the JHM virus infection in the C3H strain. No significant differences were observed in the NK cell activity of the peritoneal exudate or spleen cells of infected mice. Low levels of interferon were detected in serum or peritoneal exudate of C3H mice infected with JHM virus 18 or 24 hours before, but no detectable early interferon production was found. Also no interferon could be detected in the resistant SJL mice. After JHM virus infection, the number of peritoneal exudate cells (PEC) was increased significantly in C3H mice but not in SJL mice. Macrophages obtained from the C3H mice supported virus replication, whereas SJL macrophages did not. Our data suggest that NK cells do not play a role in the resistance of SJL mice against JHM virus infection but may participate in the defence mechanisms against this virus in C3H mice.
