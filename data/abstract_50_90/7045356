A short-course, low-dose perioperative prophylactic regimen of cephradine was found to be highly effective in preventing serious postoperative infections (wound, vaginal cuff/pelvic and endometrial) in patients undergoing cesarean sections and vaginal hysterectomies. In patients undergoing abdominal hysterectomy no significant difference was observed in the prevalence of wound and pelvic infections in the antibiotic and placebo-treated groups. In all three operative procedures there was no significant reduction in urinary tract infections. The postoperative length of stay was significantly decreased in cesarean section patients, and a similar trend was observed in vaginal hysterectomy patients. An analysis of risk factors in cesarean section revealed that anemia and labor reduced the effectiveness of prophylaxis. Among vaginal hysterectomy patients those who were anemic and those who were premenopausal were at greater risk of infection. There was a low incidence of adverse drug reactions (less than 0.5%) and no evidence of the promotion of bacterial resistance in cephradine-treated patients.
