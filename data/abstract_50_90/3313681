The in vitro activity of ciprofloxacin against bacterial enteropathogens isolated from cases of travellers' diarrhea in Egypt was compared to trimethoprim (TMP) and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (SXT). No resistance to ciprofloxacin was noted for any of the Campylobacter jejuni/coli, Shigella spp., and enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli strains examined. However, resistance to TMP and SXT was noted among these same strains. Because of its broad spectrum and lack of resistance, ciprofloxacin is potentially a useful drug for the treatment of diarrhea caused by bacterial enteropathogens encountered in this region of the world.
