Mutants of Escherichia coli were isolated by their resistance to the bacteriocidal effects of the membrane-active drugs polymyxin B, levallorphan, and tetracaine. The mutants were examined for additional changes in cellular physiology evoked by the lesions; many polymyxin-resistant strains had a concomitant increased sensitivity to anionic detergents, and several strains of each type had concomitant alterations in generation time and morphology. Mutants of each class (polymyxin resistant, tetracaine resistant, and levallorphan resistant) were transduced into recipient strains. The levallorphan resistance site (lev) was located at approximately 9 min on the E. coli chromosome. Polymyxin (pmx) and tetracaine (tec) resistance loci were also transduced. The lev and tec strains had a slight prolongation of generation time, in contrast with their isogenic wild-type strains. The tec transductant produced long filaments in the absence of tetracaine and had an altered colonial morphology, it reverted at high frequency, with the morphological abnormalities reverting along with the tetracaine resistance. The pmx transductant had an increased sensitivity to levallorphan and to anionic detergents. In contrast, both lev and tec mutants were more resistant to acriflavine than was the wild type or the pmx transductant. The pmx, lev, and tec loci differed in sensitivity to mitomycin C; the lev strain was more resistant, the tec strain was more sensitive, and the pmx strain was much more sensitive than the wild type. There was no difference in sensitivity to several other dyes and detergents, colicins, or T bacteriophage between the transductant and isogenic wild-type strains. Thus, lev, tec, and pmx loci confer more subtle alterations in the permeability barrier than do lipopolysaccharide-deficient mutants previously studied.
