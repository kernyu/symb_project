LM(TK-) mouse fibroblast cells that were biochemically transformed to the dThd kinase-positive phenotype by restriction nuclease fragments of herpes simplex virus or marmoset herpesvirus DNA, all of which contained the virus dThd kinase coding region, or by HeLa S3 DNA were more resistant to mutagenesis by N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine or 5-bromodeoxyuridine than were dThd kinase-positive LM and LM(TK-) cells. Measurements of dNTP pool sizes did not reveal relative imbalances for representative cell lines under several conditions of growth.
