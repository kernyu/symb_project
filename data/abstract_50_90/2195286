100 cases of imported malaria were registered in Hospitals of Bordeaux in 1987 and 85 in 1988. Origin of infestation is Africa in 88 p.c. of the cases mainly from Central Africa (50 p.c.) in 1987 and western Africa (67 p.c.) in 1988. The most frequent species was Plasmodium falciparum 73 p.c. in 1987 and 82 p.c. in 1988. Admitted cases in Bordeaux were mainly French (81 p.c.) with a significant male prevailing and young adults. Mean age was 29 for Europeans and 19 for the others mainly Africans. Infestation risk is in close correlation with the duration of stay in endemic zones. It is maximum for stays between 2 and 11 months. Delay for first symptoms to appear following return from an endemic zone depends of species concerned during the first month, 83 p.c. of malaria fever at Plasmodium falciparum during the second quarter, 50 p.c. of fever at Plasmodium vivax, and after one year or more 40 p.c. at Plasmodium ovale. Only 1/4 of the cases were diagnosed during the first 48 hours. Delay in diagnosing may be prolonged and is in relationship with Plasmodium falciparum chemoresistance and self-medication. 21 strains of Plasmodium falciparum were chloroquinoresistant in vitro: 1 from French Guyana, 9 from Western Africa, and 11 from Central Africa. The strain from Guyana was also less sensible to quinine with a IC 50 = 480 nmol/l.
