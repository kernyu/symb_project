This study reports high incidence tumourigenic activity of the pSV2neo plasmid demonstrated by transfection of NIH 3T3 cells. The plasmid is frequently used as a dominant selectable marker for confirming successful gene transfection, and the findings indicate a need for caution in interpretation and design of assays for oncogenes which use co-transfection and subsequent selection with neomycin.
