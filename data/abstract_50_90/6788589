Addition of ppApp to Sterlini-Mandelstam medium stimulates sporulation of a conditionally asporogenous rifampin-resistant mutant of Bacillus subtilis to the same extent as the effect of 4 amino acids. Mutant cells sporulating in the presence of amino acids also produce 2 phosphorylated nucleotides one of which comigrated with ppApp on PEI thin layer chromatogram.
