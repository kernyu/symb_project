We present the nucleotide sequence of the oriT region from plasmid R100. Comparison to other IncF plasmids revealed homology around the proposed nick sites as well as conservation of inverted repeated sequences in the nonhomologous region. Three areas showed strong homology (eight of nine nucleotides) to the consensus sequence for binding of integration host factor, suggesting a role for this DNA-binding protein in nicking at oriT.
