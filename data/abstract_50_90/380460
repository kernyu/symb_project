A group H1 R factor encoding resistance to chloramphenicol, streptomycin, sulfonamide, and tetracycline was transferred into Salmonella typhimurium LT-2. The virulence of LT-2 for mice, as assessed by intraperitoneal 50% lethal dose and the number of organisms in the spleen, was not affected by the R factor. On the other hand, the R factor conferred resistance in mouse infections to therapy with chloramphenicol and trimethoprim plus sulfamethoxazole.
