Acute exacerbations of bronchitis are probably best treated with erythromycin or cotrimoxazole. The rising incidence of ampicillin resistance is reducing its value. Oxytetracycline and cephalosporins are best avoided. Trimethroprim may prove a safer alternative to cotrimoxazole. However, all these conclusions are based on theoretical reasons rather than large comparative trials.
