Aztreonam (AZT) was given intravenously to 20 children with the following acute bacterial infections: 13 cases of bronchopneumonia, 5 cases of urinary tract infection, 1 case of cervical lymphadenitis with acute tonsillitis and 1 case of acute enteritis. Clinical effectiveness was obtained in 17 cases of 20 cases and bacteriological effectiveness in 10 strains out of 11 strains. No side effect was observed except for 2 cases with eruption, 1 case with slight elevation of GPT, 1 case with slight elevation of GOT and 1 case with slight elevation of GOT and GPT. From the above clinical results, it is apparent that AZT is a useful antibiotic for treating pediatric patients with various kinds of bacterial infections.
