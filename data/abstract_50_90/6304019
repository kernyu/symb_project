A plasmid useful for locating the chromosomal site of cloned DNA fragments that lack intrinsic genetic activity, for insertional mutagenesis, for single-copy complementation, and for dominance studies was constructed. Some plasmids containing Bacillus subtilis DNA were only active in transformation when the tetracycline resistance determinant of the plasmid was inactivated. The results suggest that production of the tetracycline gene product is lethal to B. subtilis.
