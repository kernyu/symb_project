After considering the different reasons that make the problem of bacterial resistance of Gram-negative bacilli to antibiotics of great interest in a long-term hospital, the AA. present their cases.

One thing seems to be noteworthy in their opinion: the bacterial resistance of the germs isolated from the urine is bigger than the one of the germs isolated from the respiratory apparatus.
