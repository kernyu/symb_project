Eleven clinical strains of Chromobacterium violaceum were tested for their susceptibility to 25 antimicrobial agents. Ciprofloxacin was the most active of the compounds tested although norfloxacin and pefloxacin were highly active. No resistance was detected to mezlocillin, piperacillin, apalcillin, imipenem, and aztreonam while a single strain was resistant to ticarcillin. Among the cephalosporin/cephamycin group only cefotetan showed good in vitro activity. Gentamicin was more active than amikacin and tobramycin. Good in vitro activity was also noted for chloramphenicol, doxycycline, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole while C. violaceum strains were highly resistant to rifampin and vancomycin. The bactericidal activity of selected agents was shown to be concentration dependent using time-kill kinetic studies. Addition of clavulanic acid did not increase the activity of ticarcillin and in one case was shown to induce beta-lactamase. High correlation was noted between the broth microdilution and disk diffusion susceptibility tests in predicting the susceptibility patterns of C. violaceum.
