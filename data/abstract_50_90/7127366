Third-generation beta-lactam antibiotics are effective against a wider range of microorganisms than are older antibiotics. Cefotaxime, moxalactam, cefoperazone, ceftizoxime, ceftazidime, cefsulodin, and ceftriaxone were used to treat 102 patients hospitalized with orthopedic infections. Sensitivity of the pathogens to the antibiotic used was established in all cases. Patients allergic to penicillin were given either moxalactam or ceftazidime. Pathogens were eradicated in all but six instances, five of which were Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Four of these developed resistance during therapy. Only three patients had clinical responses that were less than satisfactory. No serious adverse reaction occurred, and no allergic reactions developed. This new class of antibiotics is thus safe and effective as the sole therapeutic agent for many orthopedic infections, including those that require long periods of treatment.
