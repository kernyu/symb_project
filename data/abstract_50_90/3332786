Although gonorrhea rates for the 1980s appear to have plateaued or even declined slightly in developed nations, in the developing world rates appear to be continuing to increase. In recent years, worldwide gonorrhea control efforts have been compromised by the continuing emergence of antimicrobial resistance resulting from plasmid-mediated beta-lactamase production, plasmid-mediated tetracycline resistance, and chromosomally mediated resistance to many antimicrobial agents. Intensive investigation of gonococcal physiology and structure has provided insights into gonococcal pathogenesis and epidemiology. Application of knowledge gained through basic research is being used to provide improved methods of gonorrhea diagnosis and to identify components of potential gonococcal vaccines.
