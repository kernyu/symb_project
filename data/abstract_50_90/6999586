Study of the behaviour to 7 antibiotics and chemotherapeutics of the Shigella and E. coli strains, isolated from the feces samples of children and adults in a closed community, revealed the high incidence of multiple resistance, especially to the currently used drugs tested. The existence of the phenomenon of plasmid transferable resistance in commensal or pathogenic E. coli strains is an important factor in the appearance of epidemic foci caused by Shigella and T. coli strains, multiply resistant to antibiotics.
