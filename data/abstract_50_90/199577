Previous publications showed that a covalently closed circular (CCC) Rts1 plasmid deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) that confers kanamycin resistance upon the host bacteria inhibits host growth at 42 degrees C but not at 32 degrees C. At 42 degrees C, the CCC Rts1 DNA is not formed, and cells without plasmids emerge. To investigate the possible role of cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP) in the action of Rts1 on host bacteria, Rts1 was placed in an Escherichia coli mutant (CA7902) that lacks adenylate cyclase or in E. coli PP47 (a mutant lacking cAMP receptor protein). Rts1 did not exert the thermosensitive effect on these cells, and CCC Rts1 DNA was formed even at 42 degrees C. Upon addition of cAMP to E. coli CA7902(Rts1), cell growth and formation of CCC Rts1 DNA were inhibited at 42 degrees C. The addition of cAMP to E. coli PP47(Rts1) did not cause inhibitory effects on either cell growth or CCC Rts1 DNA formation at 42 degrees C. The inhibitory effect of cAMP on E. coli CA7902(Rts1) is specific to this cyclic nucleotide, and other cyclic nucleotides such as cyclic guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate did not have the effect. For this inhibitory effect, cells have to be preincubated with cAMP; the presence of cAMP at the time of CCC Rts1 DNA formation is not enough for the inhibitory effect. If the cells are preincubated with cAMP, one can remove cAMP during the [(3)H]thymidine pulse and still observe its inhibitory effect on the formation of CCC Rts1 DNA. The presence of chloramphenicol during this preincubation period abolished the inhibitory effect of cAMP. These observations suggest that cAMP is necessary to induce synthesis of a protein that inhibits CCC Rts1 DNA formation and cell growth at 42 degrees C.
