Sulbactam/ampicillin (SBT/ABPC) was given intravenously to 20 children with the following acute bacterial infections; 14 cases of pneumonia, 2 cases of purulent cervical lymphadenitis and 1 case each of bronchitis, pyothorax, cellulitis, and purulent meningitis. Good clinical responses were obtained in 18 out of 20 patients, and bacteriologically, all of the 14 isolated strains were eradicated. No side effect was observed except 2 cases of eosinophilia, and 1 case each of loose stool and elevated thrombocyte. From the above clinical results, it is apparent that SBT/ABPC is a useful antibiotic for the treatment of pediatric patients with various kinds of bacterial infections.
