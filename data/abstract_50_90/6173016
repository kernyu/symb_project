The effects of 61 synthetic tuberactinomycin derivatives on polypeptide synthesis were tested in bacterial cell-free systems. Di-beta-lys-capreomycin IIA was more effective than the natural product. Palmitoyl tuberactinamine N inhibited the growth of tuberactinomycin-resistant mutants and was not a ribosome inhibitor.
