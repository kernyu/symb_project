The number of primary malaria attacks caused by imported infections notified in the Federal Republic of Germany during the period of 1963 through 1975 has increased five fold from 30 to 154 per year. The total number of deaths in the same period was 55. This gave rise to outline again the established methods of chemotherapy and their parasitological basis. The chloroquine resistance of P. falciparum strains is discussed. No causal relationship exists between drug resistance and the fatalities by imported malaria. The need for early diagnosis and treatment in falciparum malaria is emphasized. In order to avoid diagnostic difficulties in medical practice it is suggested to have blood films for parasitological diagnosis sent to a specialized laboratory, and to start chloroquine treatment immediately without awaiting confirmation or rejection of the diagnosis. This procedure would minimize the risk for the patient and would cause no harm if malaria should not be confirmed.
