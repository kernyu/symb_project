To evaluate the activity of antiseptics and the sensitivity-resistance of bacteria to antiseptics, a number of characteristics has been used, including the minimum inhibiting concentration for different strains, the frequency of statistical and clinical resistance, the antiseptic activity index. A wide spread of S. aureus strains isolated from patients with hospital infections has been revealed. Differences in the resistance of bacterial strains have been established, depending on the type of the antiseptic and the ecovar of bacteria: among hospital ecovars, resistant strains occur more frequently and can resist a wider range of antibiotics. In staphylococcal hospital ecovars the occurrence and level of resistance to a number of widely used antiseptics increase with time. In connection with a wide spread of staphylococcal hospital strains resistant to antiseptics, measures on the control of the circulation of such strains should be introduced into hospitals, and the data thus obtained should be used for the periodic reevaluation of antiseptics used in medical practice and for the choice of preparations to be used for individual therapeutic and prophylactic antisepsis.
