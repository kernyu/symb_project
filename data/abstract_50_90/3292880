The test for susceptibility to kanamycin is useful for differentiating between the genera Rhodococcus and Nocardia. All rhodococci except R. equi, R. erythropolis, and R. aurantiacus are susceptible to kanamycin, whereas all nocardiae except N. otitidis-caviarum are resistant to kanamycin. Tests for susceptibility to rifampicin, streptomycin, and minocycline also are useful for differentiating among the species of each genus.
