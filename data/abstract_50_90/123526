The ability of phage group II staphylococcal strain UT 0101 to produce exfoliative toxin and bacteriocin could be eliminated at a high frequency after growth at high temperatures or in the presence of ethidium bromide or sodium dodecyl sulfate. Extrachromosomal deoxyribonucleic acid, associated with the genes for exfoliative toxin and bacteriocin production, was isolated from strain UT 0101 but was absent from an ethidium bromide-cured substrain. The molecular weight of the exfoliative toxin plasmid, determined by co-sedimentation with the penicillinase plasmid, PI258, was 3.3 times 10-7. The 56S covalently closed circular form of the exfoliative toxin plasmid converted to a 38S open circular form after storage or exposure to sodium dodecyl sulfate. Plasmid deoxyribonucleic acid associated with penicillin resistance could not be identified in the penicillin-resistance Tox+ strains, UT 0007 and UT 0001.
