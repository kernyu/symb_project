During the first three months of 1976 and 1978 the sensitivity patterns of bacteria and the antibiotic usage at the National Hospital of Norway was recorded. The computerized results showed that bacteria isolated at the department of pediatrics was more resistant to penicillins. Isolates from two other departments did not differ very much in their sensitivity patterns. Comparing the sensitivity patterns, a tendency of increased sensitivity to antibiotics from 1976 to 1978 was seen. Exception was the increasing resistance to gentamicin. Furthermore, tobramycin was found less effective than gentamicin on our isolates. The antibiotics most widely used at the hospital are the penicillins which account for more than 50 per cent of the usage. From 1976 to 1978 the usage of antibiotics increased about 30 per cent. A more extensive use of penicillin V and G, and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim was responsible for most of the increase. No clear cut relationship between the antibiotic usage and the changes in sensitivity patterns of the bacteria from 1976 to 1978 was seen. Our work confirms, the usefulness of using "daily defined doses", as recommended by WHO, for estimating the antibiotic usage in a hospital.
