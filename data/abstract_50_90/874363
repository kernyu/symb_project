The role of RNA metabolism in human PMN phagocytosis was examined. By the inhibition of RNA synthesis with actinomycin D, intracellular killing of a strain of actinomycin D-resistant S. epidermidis was unaffected by 1 hr but significantly decreased by 2 and 3 hr. After 1 hr, phagocytosis began to decrease, and iodination of proteins also decreased in the presence of actinomycin D. Hexosemonophosphate shunt activity remained similar for both actinomycin D treated PMN's and control cells at 30 min and 2 hr. Protein synthesis was inhibited by incubating PMN's with puromycin. The ability of the PMN's to kill puromycin-resistant S. epidermidis was significantly decreased at 2 and 3 hr.
