The activity of 2'-5' oligo(A) synthetase has been measured both in control and interferon-treated lymphoid cells. While control or interferon-treated Raji and Namalwa cells exhibit low activity of the 2'-5' oligo(A) synthetase, the activity of this enzyme is increased 20-fold when Daudi cells are treated with the same dose of human interferon. The same enzyme is induced by interferon in R3HR-1 cells to a lesser extent.
