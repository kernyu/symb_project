A detection procedure was developed in which a newly devised lysine-iron medium was used as a one-step selective and enrichment medium for detection of salmonellae by the fluorescent-antibody technique. Incubation was conducted in two steps: initially at 30 C for 5 hr to resuscitate sublethally stressed cells, followed by incubation at 39 C for 17 hr. Twenty-seven strains of salmonellae from groups A-I were utilized in the development of this procedure which was sensitive enough to detect one Salmonella bacterium in 100 g of nonfat dry milk.
