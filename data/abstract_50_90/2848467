Activity of polymyxin B nonapeptide alone and in combination with other antibiotics against clinical strains of Pseudomonas and enteric bacteria was studied. It was shown that nonapeptide was highly active against Pseudomonas and moderately active against enteric bacteria. In combination with rifampicin, fusidic acid or erythromycin the nonapeptide had a potentiating effect on the tested strains.
