Sensitivity to levomycetin, streptomycin, chlortetracycline, oxtetracycline, tetracycline, neomycin, monomycin and erythromycin of 548 fresh isolates of Salmonella of 32 serotypes of the main groups A, B, C, D and E was studied. The cultures were isolated from salmonellosis patients within 1967-1974. Sensitivity to neomycin, monomycin, levomycetin and streptomycin was found respectively in 96.9, 91.1, 76.5 and 74.8 per cent of the cultures. High sensitivity of the cultures was observed only to levomycetin (15.1 per cent). With respect to tetracyclines the isolates were mainly resistant (24.2-47.2 per cent) or low sensitive (25-26.5 per cent). 70.3 per cent of the strains were resistant to erythromycin and 24.1 per cent were of low sensitivity. The causative agents of typhoid fever, paratyphoid fever A and B were more sensitive to levomycetin and tetracycline as compared to other Salmonella. A polyvalent Salmonella bacteriophage lyzed from 94.2 to 100 per cent of the Salmonella cultures tested.
