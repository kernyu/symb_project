It was shown that cyt+-determinant could not be eliminated when the Sh. flexneri cultures were treated with ethidium bromide under the regimen providing the elimination of the F'lac-factor in a part of shigellae population. The cytotoxic Sh. flexneri strains which acquired the R-factor transmitted the multiple drug resistance to the cyt minus -strain of Sh. flexneri, but not the cyt+-properties. There was found no correlation between the cytoxicity of the Sh. flexneri strains and their capacity to mobilize the nontransmissive STr-ex-episome in the triple cross experiments. The results obtained were in favour of the chromosomal nature of cyt+-determinants controlling the capacity of Sh. flexneri to produce the lethal action on the macrophages.
