From the results of taxonomic studies, Streptomyces sp. strain No. K-82 isolated from a soil sample collected in Kumamoto city, was identified as a strain belonging to Streptomyces lavendulae WAKSMAN & HENRICI 1948. The strain produced an active new antibiotic called K-82 A and minor components named the B complex. Antibiotic K-82 A was isolated as dark reddish needles by silica gel column chromatography and found to have both antibacterial activity and high phage induction activity. The K-82 B complex was found to consist of at least five components, among which K-82 B2 and B3 were isolated as crystals. Substances K-82 B2 was identified as benzoic acid from its physicochemical properties. Substance B3 like B2 had only marginal antibiotic activity.
