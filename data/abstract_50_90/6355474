The prevalence of strictly anaerobic bacteria in the secretions from untreated cases of mastitis in lactating dairy cows was investigated. The study involved 147 Friesland cows in 12 highveld herds. All herds yielded cows with anaerobic udder infections. No anaerobic bacteria were recovered from cows with normal quarters or those with latent aerobic infections. Only anaerobes were present in 10% of so-called 'aseptic' mastitis cases. A variety of anaerobic organisms was isolated concurrently with facultative bacteria from 5,3% and 58,8% of cases classified as subclinical and clinical respectively. Peptococcus spp. was associated with Corynebacterium pyogenes and Bacteroides spp. with Staphylococcus aureus and/or Streptococcus agalactiae in 80% anaerobic udder infections. Gram positive anaerobic species were mostly sensitive to penicillin-G but all the Gram negative rods were resistant. In addition, all B. fragilis strains produced beta-lactamase. The ability to produce heparinase was demonstrated in one strain of Peptococcus indolicus and a Peptostreptococcus sp.
