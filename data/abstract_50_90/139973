The transmissible Carbenicillin resistance factor R (56 BE) was isolated in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. It was not cured by usual agents and not isolated by ultra-centrifugation. So the plasmidic nature may be doubtful. We demonstrate in this paper that it is possible: 1) to transduce this factor into bacteria which is then able to conjugate and to transfer resistance to another bacteria, 2) to transfer carbenicillin resistance to arginine deficient strains without bringing chromosomic genes, 3) to obtain the carbenicillin resistance maintenance in Rec deficient strains. All these results are in favour of a plasmid.
