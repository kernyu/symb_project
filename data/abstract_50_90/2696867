In this study, we researched the susceptibility of group A Beta-hemolytic Streptococcus to antibiotics which are isolated from 218 Aydinlikevler primary blind boarding school students aged between 7-16 and a group of patient's throat and nose culture with acute and chronic upper respiratory tract infection. The susceptibility to 9 antibiotics of (100) group A Beta hemolytic Streptococcus which were isolated 52 from throat, 48 from nasal discharge were examined by the method of disc diffusion test after determination of the colony, hemolysis and staining characteristics also the sensibility to optochine and bacitracin (0.04 U) discs colonies. The antibiotic resistance ratio are observed as 24%. For Penicillin-G, 59% for Ampicillin, 17% for Amoxicillin, 31% for Methicillin, 22% for Cephalexin, 33% for Carbenicillin, 77% for Lincomycin, 60% for Trimethoprim/Sulphamethoxazole, 26% for Chloramphenicol. This finding shows that group A Beta hemolytic Streptococcus are getting being resistant to this 9 antibiotics. Also this results indicate that the treatment after antibiotic susceptibility test of group A Beta hemolytic Streptococcus is more effective.
