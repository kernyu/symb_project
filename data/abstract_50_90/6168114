Investigation of 112 influenza A (H1N1 and H3N2) virus strains isolated in different years demonstrated their different interferon-inducing activity. The detection of strain differences in the process of interferon production is very important for the study of influenza infection pathogenicity. Of special importance are the studies of influenza virus strain sensitivity to the effect of exogenous interferon. Overcoming of resistance to interferon is important for effective influenza control. The experiments done by the authors confirm that interferon is a factor of natural immunity. When exogenous interferon is given to an infected host, it interacts with interferon induced by the infectious process. The therapeutic-prophylactic effect of interferon was clearly manifest with increasing age.
