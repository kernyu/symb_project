A number of novel indolo (3,2-c) quinoline-N-oxides possess antimalarial activity. One of the series, compound CM 6606, has a superior blood schizontocidal action against drug-sensitive Plasmodium berghei in the mouse to that of chloroquine, although it is not fully active against strains highly resistant to chloroquine or mefloquine. It also shows some tissue schizontocidal (causal prophylactic) and gametocytocidal action in mice infected with P. yoelii nigeriensis. The structure activity of this chemical series and the possibility that CM 6606 functions through an active metabolite are discussed.
