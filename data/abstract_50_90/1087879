There are six drugs usually implicated in peptic ulceration and these are adrenal corticosteroids, aspirin, phenylbutazone, indomethacin, ethanol and caffeine. The types of data upon which these conclusions rest follows three lines of evidence. First, the production of ulcers in experimental animals; all the drugs mentioned above can produce experimental ulcers. Second, the cause and effect relationship in man, i.e. epidemiological evidence; the epidemiological evidence is very weak except for aspirin. Third, a mechanism suspected of participating in the pathogenesis; the pathogenesis of drug ulceration is not fully understood but aspirin may be the only one with a body of data to support its ulcerogenic effect. The pathogenesis of peptic ulcer is usually considered in terms of the equation, acid-pepsin versus mucosal resistance. Caffeine is a moderately strong stimulus of acid secretion but corticosteroids, phenylbutazone, ethanol and indomethacin are very weak stimulants or have no effect. Aspirin decreases acid secretion...
