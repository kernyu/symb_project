S. typhimurium strains isolated in 14 regions of the USSR have, parallel with considerable similarity in their biological characteristics, a number of essential differences. These differences become manifest in the determination of the plasmid spectra of the above organisms. The transfer of R-plasmid PLE518 F1 me fin+ with a molecular weight of 96 Md to strains, sensitive to the action of typing bacteriophages, renders these strains resistant to the lytic action of a number of phages, which leads to the conversion of their phage type. In some cases it may deteriorate the validity of the method of phage typing, used for epidemiological purposes.
