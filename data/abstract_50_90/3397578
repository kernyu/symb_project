Altogether, 488 consecutive strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae isolated from clinical specimens were serotyped and their antibiotic susceptibility determined. Of all strains isolated, 89.7% (90.6% for strains isolated from patients with serious infection) were of types present in the new polyvalent (23-valent) pneumococcal vaccine. Four strains showed reduced susceptibility to penicillin (minimum inhibitory concentration 0.1-1.0 mg/l). Two of those strains (both serotype 23) were also of intermediate susceptibility to other antibiotics (ampicillin, cephradine, chloramphenicol and tetracycline) but were sensitive to erythromycin. A significant proportion (12%) was resistant to tetracycline.
