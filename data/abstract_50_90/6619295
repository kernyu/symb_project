Five yeast strains, causally associated with septicemia and death in a patient after peritonitis, were identified as Candida lusitaniae van Uden et do Carmo-Sousa by standard methods. The organism was initially susceptible to 5-fluorocytosine but strongly resistant to amphotericin B, requiring 50 micrograms/ml for complete inhibition at 48 h.
