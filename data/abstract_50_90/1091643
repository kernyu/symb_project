The transcription of Azotobacter phage A21 DNA by Escherichia coli or Azotobacter vinelandii RNA polymerase differs from that of some other DNAs in its inhibition by moderate concentrations of KCl. This characteristic results in an apparent low template activity for this DNA as compared with T4 DNA under standard assay conditions. From an analysis of the dependence of the various steps in initiation on KCl it is concluded that the effect is exerted on an equilibrium between an inactive polymerase-DNA complex and an active preintitiation complex. This salt-sensitive equilibrium favors the inactive complex at a lower KCl concentration than with other templates. It can be approached from other low or high salt concentrations at a measurably slow rate.
