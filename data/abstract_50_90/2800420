Occurrence of methicillin resistant staphylococcal strains in hospital environment is more frequently found. These strains are multiresistant so that diseases caused by them require a special therapeutical approach. They are significant causative agents of intrahospital infections which may have epidemic character. Using two methods for detection of methicillin resistant staphylococcus 335 strains were tested. Methicillin resistance was found in 36 (20.6%) of 175 strains of St. aureus and 49 (30.5%) strains of coagulase negative staphylococci. The largest number of methicillin resistant strains is isolated from materials of patients hospitalized at surgical and hematological clinics.
