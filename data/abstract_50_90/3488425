The in vitro susceptibilities of various causative organisms recently isolated from patients with genital infections to BRL 25000 (a formulation with 2 parts of amoxicillin and 1 part of potassium clavulanate), amoxicillin (AMPC), cefaclor (CCL), cephalexin (CEX), cefadroxil (CDX) and cefroxadine (CXD) were determined. beta-Lactamase-producing strains were detected by the nitrocefin disc method. Frequencies of isolation of beta-lactamase producing strains of E. coli, K. pneumoniae and B. fragilis were 36%, 96% and 100%, respectively. The activity of BRL 25000 against S. agalactiae and anaerobic GPC (anaerobic Streptococci, Peptostreptococcus spp.) was slightly less than that of AMPC but was 2- to 4-fold higher than CCL and 8- to 16-fold higher than CEX, CDX and CXD. Against E. coli and K. pneumoniae, the activity of BRL 25000 was superior to that of AMPC and approximately equal to CEX, CDX and CXD but 2-fold less than CCL. Against the B. fragilis group, BRL 25000 was much more active than AMPC or any of the cephalosporins tested, clearly demonstrating the beta-lactamase inhibitory properties of the clavulanic acid in BRL 25000. At inocula of 10(6) CFU/ml, MIC values of BRL 25000 were 12.5-50 micrograms/ml against some strains of E. coli, K. pneumoniae and B. fragilis. A mechanism of resistance other than beta-lactamase production is obviously prevalent in these strains. It is speculated that the resistance may be due to a low affinity of the drug to target proteins. Mixed infections of B. fragilis and E. coli or K. pneumoniae are commonly found in the obstetric and gynecological patients. BRL 25000 shows activity against these strains and also against both aerobic and anaerobic GPC. Therefore, BRL 25000 is considered useful for the treatment of genital infections.
