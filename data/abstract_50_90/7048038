Over 250 strains of Staphylococcus aureus isolated from patients who presented with infections acquired outside the hospital were tested for susceptibility to penicillin G, minocycline and erythromycin. Only 15.5% of strains could be regarded as sensitive to penicillin, whereas 99.2% and 90.2% were sensitive to minocycline and erythromycin respectively. Beta-haemolytic streptococci were found in association with Staph. aureus in 17.5% of the lesions cultured in this survey. The susceptibility of a further 100 strains of methicillin-sensitive Staph. aureus to a wider range of antimicrobial agents was also examined.
