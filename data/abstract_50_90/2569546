Antibiotic sensitivity of opportunistic microflora of men before and after exposure to an enclosed environment for as long as 2-8 to 96-175 days was investigated. It was found that after exposure the spectrum of opportunistic enterobacteria resistant to antibacterial drugs was enlarged. The results of serotyping of the isolated bacteria showed that one of the pathways that led to an increase in the number of antibiotic-resistant microorganisms was individual variations in the intestinal automicroflora which were characterized by a decrease in the amount of some species of enterobacteria and an increase in the amount of other species.
