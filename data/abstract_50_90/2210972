Fifty-four patients with complicated UTI were administered ciprofloxacin in doses of 500 mg (30 subjects) and 250 mg (24 subjects) at 12-hour intervals. While a positive effect was noted in 96-100% upon termination of therapy, the effect was still present 3 weeks later in 90% of the high-dose, but only in 71% of the low-dose group. In 23 patients with uncomplicated UTI, a positive effect of the three-day therapy with 100 mg of ciprofloxacin at 12-hour intervals was observed in 91% of subjects. Intolerance to the agent was found in one case only. Development of resistance to ciprofloxacin was not observed.
