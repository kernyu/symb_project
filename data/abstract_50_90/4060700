Mechanism of specific resistance development in experimental tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) and possible effects on this mechanism were studied. Thorough characterization of the immune status of animals included quantitative and functional changes in populations of T and B lymphocytes determined over time via changes in the rosette-forming and antibody producing cells, antihemagglutinins, and index of migration inhibition. Stimulation or inhibition of some links of immunogenesis by means of preparations of directed effect (carageenan, ascorbic acid, heterologous serum, theophylline, levamisole) was reflected in parameters of the immune status and pathogenetic features of TBE. The appearance in the first days after infection of marked specific sensitization, high values of RFC in passive rosette-formation and inhibited function of antibody producing cells, no IgG synthesis by the end of the 1st week were accompanied by high lethality which indicated the lack of resistance to primary infection. The degree of specific sensitization and responsiveness of the animals to antigen was inversely, and antibody response directly related to the degree of resistance.
