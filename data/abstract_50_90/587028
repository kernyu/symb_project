Fifty random clinical isolates of Haemophilus parainfluenzae were tested for their susceptibility to 10 antibiotics by a microtiter broth dilution method. Three of the strains tested were resistant to ampicillin, whereas eight were resistant to tetracycline. All strains tested were susceptible to chloramphenicol, kanamycin, gentamicin, cephalothin, and colistin. The ranges of minimal inhibitory concentrations for the three remaining antibiotics were: 0.5 to >/=128 mug of penicillin G per ml, 0.03 to 4 mug of carbenicillin per ml, and 1 to 16 mug of erythromycin per ml. Elevated minimal inhibitory concentrations for penicillin and carbenicillin were noted for the three ampicillin-resistant strains. Tests for beta-lactamase production demonstrated the presence of this enzyme in each of the three ampicillin-resistant strains.
