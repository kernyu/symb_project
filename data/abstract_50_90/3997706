A study of urinary coliform isolates, from patients attending their general practitioner, between 1981 and 1983 showed that 10.2% were resistant to trimethoprim. Forty-four trimethoprim-resistant Escherichia coli were collected for further study and the results compared with those obtained from hospital isolates collected during 1979-80 and 1982. Thirty-two (73%) were highly resistant to trimethoprim (MIC greater than 1024 mg/l) a similar proportion to that in the hospital isolates. The highly resistant isolates bore a close resemblance to the hospital isolates in that 66% carried multiple plasmids, 97% were multiply drug-resistant and all were highly resistant to sulphamethoxazole. The frequency of antimicrobial resistance transfer (59%) was similar to that from the hospital isolates. More than half of the trimethoprim resistance plasmids characterized were indistinguishable in terms of mol.wt and resistance pattern from those found in isolates from the hospital collections. Our results suggest that, whereas trimethoprim-resistant E. coli are less commonly isolated from patients in the community than in hospitals, many of the community isolates may have originated from a hospital source.
