New biochemically marked Djungarian hamster cell line (DX-TK-) was established. These cells are resistant to 5-bromodeoxyuridine (25 mkg/ml) and deficient in thymidine kinase activity (TK-). Due to this biochemical defect they have lost the ability to grow in HAT medium. DX-TK- cells are malignant. They grow as tumours after the inoculation to newborn Djungarian hamsters. Tumorigenecity of DX-TK- cells was decreased as compared with the parent TK+ cell line. DX-TK- cell line is a hypodiploid cell culture (26 chromosomes) with 7 chromosome markers easily identified by means of G-band staining. This line is a new model for somatic cell genetic experiments, particularly for somatic cell hybridization.
