The kanamycin resistance transposon Tn903 consists of a unique region of about 1000 base pairs bounded by a pair of 1050-base-pair inverted repeat sequences. Each repeat contains two Pvu II endonuclease cleavage sites separated by 520 base pairs. We have constructed derivatives of Tn903 in which this 520-base-pair fragment is deleted from one or both repeats. Those derivatives that lack both 520-base-pair fragments cannot transpose, whereas those that lack just one remain transposition proficient. One such transposable derivative, Tn903 delta I, has been selected for further study. We have determined the sequence of the intact inverted repeat. The 18 base pairs at each end are identical and inverted relative to one another, a structure characteristic of insertion sequences. Additional experiments indicate that a single inverted repeat from Tn903 can, in fact, transpose; we propose that this element be called IS903. To correlate the DNA sequence with genetic activities, we have created mutations by inserting a 10-base-pair DNA fragment at several sites within the intact repeat of Tn903 delta 1, and we have examined the effect of such insertions on transposability. The results suggest that IS903 encodes a 307-amino-acid polypeptide (a "transposase") that is absolutely required for transposition of IS903 or Tn903.
