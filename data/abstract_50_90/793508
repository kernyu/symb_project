Sensitivity of Proteus clinical strains to benzylpenicillin, ampicillin and ceporin, as well as the dynamics and stability of the drug resistance was studied. It was found that the beta-lactamides were active against Proteus, ceporin being the most effective antibiotic. Strains resistant simultaneously to 2 or 3 drugs were also resistant to higher concentrations of each of them. The Proteus cultures isolated from various pathological materials did not differ by their sensitivity to benzylpenicillin and ceporin, while the strains isolated from the patient urine were least sensitive to ampicillin. The cultures of Proteus vulgaris were more resistant to the beta-lactamides as compared tcal material were more resistant to benzylpenicillin and ceporin as compared to the cultures in the H-form. No increase in the number of the Proteus strains resistant to benzylpenicillin, ampicillin or ceporin was observed within 1968-1973. The Proteus resistance to ampicillin and ceporin was not stable and was lost on storage. Reversion to sensitivity depended on the individual properties, the period of storage and the resistance level. The studies showed that the clinical strains of Proteus preserved their sensitivity to the above beta-lactame antibiotics which provided their recommendation for therapy of Proteus infections.
