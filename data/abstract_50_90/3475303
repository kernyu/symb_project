The effect of aging four commercially-available dental composites in water or ethanol at 37 degrees C for periods of up to 28 days was assessed by measuring changes in the materials' plane-strain fracture toughness (KIC). The results, obtained by means of a mini Short Rod Fracture Toughness Test specimen design, suggest that while water aging does not produce significant changes in KIC, aging in ethanol does cause significant increases in fracture toughness for three of the four dental composites studied. In view of previously-reported loss of wear resistance for dental composites aged in ethanol solutions, the present study emphasizes the difficulties in using fracture toughness to predict wear properties.
