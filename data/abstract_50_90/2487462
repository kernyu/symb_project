The in-vitro activity of ampicillin, chloramphenicol, oxytetracycline, trimethoprim-sulfamethaxazole (TMP-SMX), cefoperazone, ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, ceftizoxime, ofloxacin, pefloxacin, ciprofloxacin and fleroxacin against clinically isolated strains of Shigella spp. (n 42) have been determined in this study. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were established using the microtube dilution technique. In shigella strains relatively high percentage of resistance was found against ampicillin (% 36.5), chloramphenicol (% 34), oxytetracycline (% 35), and TMP-SMX (% 25.6). The antibiotic therapy proposals reviewed according to these results.
