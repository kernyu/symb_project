Antibacterial activities of cefotiam (CTM), cefazolin (CEZ) and cefmetazole (CMZ) against various causative organisms isolated from clinical materials were investigated. CTM showed excellent antibacterial activities against Gram negative bacilli. Especially against E. coli and Klebsiella, CTM showed superior antibacterial activities to other antibiotics, CMZ and CEZ. The MICs of CTM against Serratia and Enterobacter dispersed very widely, but showed small values comparing with CMZ and CEZ. The antibacterial activity of CTM against P. mirabilis was slightly superior to that of CMZ, but against P. vulgaris was rather inferior to that of CMZ. However, these 3 antibiotics, CTM, CMZ and CEZ, showed slightly less active against non-glucose-fermentation bacilli.
