The effect of ingestion of moderate amounts of alcohol, on nasal airway resistance, was investigated in eight normal human subjects. Alcohol was found to significantly increase both inspiratory and expiratory nasal airway resistance, P less than 0.01. The implications of this finding are discussed, in terms of its relevance to the obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome.
