The susceptibility to antimicrobial agents of 410 strains belonging to six serotypes of epidemic Salmonella (S. wien, S. saint-paul, S. panama, S. heidelberg, S. isangi and S. brandenburg) was studied. Resistance to one or more antibiotics was shown for 228 of these strains. Study of resistance transfer was investigated for 25 multiresistant strains of different epidemic origin. Resistance was coded for by conjugative R plasmids except in the case of S. brandenburg. From 20 strains of Salmonella, 39 plasmids were transferred to E. coli K12. Twenty-nine of these plasmids were classified into 7 incompatibility groups: IncFI, FII, I1, I2, N, C, M. These same groups were also found for 84 R plasmids from different enterobacteria. The "epidemic character" of these Salmonella serotypes does not seem to be associated with carriage of any particular R plasmid.
