In vitro activities of two monobactams (RO 172301 and aztreonam), ceftazidime and cefotaxime against 739 bacterial strains belonging to different species of Gram negative aero-anaerobic bacilli were studied comparatively. Strains were studied according to their resistance phenotype to beta-lactams. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of the four antibiotics were determined using the agar dilution method. RO 172301 and aztreonam exhibited a similar activity against P. aeruginosa with a MIC around 2 mg/l for 50% of strains and around 4 mg/l for 90% of strains. As compared to the two monobactams, ceftazidime was more active and cefotaxime less active (one halving dilution either way). Activity of antibiotics was not dependent upon the mechanism of resistance to beta-lactams, except for strains producing a constitutive cephalosporinase. Against Enterobacteriaceae, RO 172301 proved slightly more active than aztreonam and cefotaxime; ceftazidime was the least active drug. Only 12 of the 739 strains tested (1.6%) had a MIC for RO 172301 above 32 mg/l. The percentage of resistant strains was 2.4% for aztreonam and ceftazidime and 8.8% for cefotaxime.
