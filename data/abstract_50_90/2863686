Between 1971 and 1975, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) caused sporadic infection in eight Dublin hospitals although a case of bacteraemia was not recorded until 1976. From then on gentamicin-resistant MRSA rapidly became endemic in Dublin hospitals. The frequency of MRSA bacteraemia reached a peak in 1979-82 but MRSA infection remains an important problem. The most effective antimicrobial agent in treatment of invasive infection was vancomycin; little drug toxicity was seen. Where appropriate, concomitant surgical treatment such as debridement and drainage was usually necessary. Infection control measures directed at eliminating carriage proved effective in reducing spread. Molecular analysis showed two distinct MRSA phenotypes with similar phage-typing patterns. Gentamicin resistance was chromosomally encoded.
