In a colony with nonimmune foreigners in Maputo city (Mozambique People's Republic) active detection and treatment of patients suffering from malaria has been carried out for 1.5 years. It was shown that even in a city with some hyper- and mesoendemic regions where less than 10% of colony members were treated with chemoprophylaxis, yearly morbidity among them did not surpass 20-30 cases per 1000 population. Such index is considered to be admissible risk for health if adequate diagnosis and treatment of infection is available. Despite predominance of drug-resistant strains of tropical malaria agents among the local population, resistance to chlorochin or phancidar was observed in 3 foreign patients out of 31. In one case the clinical pattern of infection was atypical.
