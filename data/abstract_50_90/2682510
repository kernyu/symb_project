Eradication of pulmonary infection by Pseudomonas aeruginosa in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients has long presented a significant challenge to the medical community. Many antimicrobial agents have proved incompletely effective against this persistent pathogen, and even the aminoglycosides, which represent the traditional therapy for such infections, have been associated with considerable toxicity and resistance. The monobactam antibacterial agent aztreonam is used both as single-agent therapy and in combination with other drugs. Several controlled, clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy of aztreonam in the treatment of CF patients with pulmonary exacerbations caused by P. aeruginosa. The only side effect of aztreonam therapy commonly encountered in these studies was elevation of hepatic transaminase concentrations; this effect was of uncertain significance. It was concluded that aztreonam may offer clinical efficacy comparable to that provided by the combination of tobramycin plus azlocillin. Further, there does not seem to be any appreciable difference in the development of resistance to aztreonam compared with traditional therapies.
