The antibacterial activity of cefaclor against 100 non-beta-lactamase producing and 11 beta-lactamase producing isolates of Haemophilus influenzae was compared with that of cephalexin, ampicillin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline and co-trimoxazole. A new standardized microtiter dilution technique was used. Cefaclor showed greater activity than did cephalexin and inhibited beta-lactamase producing H. influenzae isolates. Ampicillin was the most active compound against non-beta-lactamase producing isolates. One of our strains was resistant to chloramphenicol and one resistant to tetracycline.
