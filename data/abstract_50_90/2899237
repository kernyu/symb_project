Halofantrine hydrochloride given to 46 Kenyan children with falciparum malaria at 10 mg/kg for two doses, and to 60 other children at 8 mg/kg for three doses, resulted in rapid parasite clearance, mean parasite clearance times being 45.4 h and 54.8 h, respectively. In-vitro chemosensitivity tests showed that most infections were due to chloroquine-resistant parasites, and that parasite maturation was inhibited by considerably lower concentrations of halofantrine than of chloroquine.
