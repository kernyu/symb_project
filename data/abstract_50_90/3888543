The activity of ceftazidime was compared with those of aztreonam, newer cephalosporins and Sch 29482 against nonfermentative gram-negative bacilli. Ceftazidime was consistently more active (MIC less than or equal to 8 micrograms) against the nonfermenters. Only Flavobacterium odoratum, F. spp., Pseudomonas alcaligenes, P. maltophilia and P. stutzeri demonstrated substantial resistance (MIC90 greater than or equal to 64 micrograms) to ceftazidime. Sch 29482 and ceftriaxone also exhibited good activity (MIC90 less than or equal to 8 micrograms) against many of the nonfermenters. The broad activity of ceftazidime, however, makes it a potentially more useful therapeutic agent against these microorganisms.
