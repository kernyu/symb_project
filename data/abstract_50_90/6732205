Sensitivity of 371 clinical strains of gram-negative bacteria not fermenting glucose. was studied with respect to 11 antibacterial drugs with the use of indicator discs. The strains were isolated from patients with purulent inflammatory diseases in 1980-1981. Gentamicin proved to be the most active in vitro against the majority of isolates. Among Pseudomonas 56 per cent of P. maltophilia strains were resistant to this antibiotic. More than 80 per cent of the strains belonging to Acinetobacter and Moroxella were sensitive to nitrofurantoin and nalidixic acid. Analogous sensitivity of these bacteria was observed with respect to streptomycin and kanamycin. About a half of the not fermenting bacteria were sensitive to chloramphenicol, rifampicin and tetracycline. The majority of the bacteria were resistant to one or more of the chemotherapeutic drugs. Strains with multiple resistance to at least 6 drugs predominated among. P. aeruginosa, P. maltophilia and P. cepacia. Such polyresistant strains were mainly isolated from the urine, from wound and ear discharge.
