Resistance of Cooperia curticei against fenbendazole was demonstrated in The Netherlands. Experimental infection of lambs followed by intraruminal injection of 5 mg kg-1 showed a 100 per cent survival of the C curticei population. With an in vitro egg development assay LC50 values between 0.23 and 0.38 micrograms ml-1 thiabendazole were found. This is the first record of a Cooperia species resistant against an anthelmintic.
