Fifteen independent E. coli strains of avian, bovine and porcine origin in Peninsular Malaysia were tested for antibiotic resistance and conjugative R plasmids. Eight (53%) isolates were found to be antibiotic resistant. Among them, 37.5% were mono-resistant and 62.5% were resistant to three or more antibiotics, i.e., multi-resistant. All of them were resistant to Tc and sensitive to Gm and Nx. Three of the eight antibiotic resistant strains were able to transfer all or part of their resistance to an E. coli K12 recipient by conjugation. The transfer frequencies of Km, Sm and Tc resistance of the three donors varied between 4.5 X 10(-8) to 6.8 X 10(-7). Analysis of the plasmid profiles of all the three donors and their respective transconjugants after agarose gel electrophoresis provided conclusive evidence that the transferable resistance traits were plasmid-mediated.
