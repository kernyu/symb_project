The insertion sites of elements Tn9 and Tn601 which determine chloramphenicol and kanamycin resistance have been detected restriction analysis. The functioning of transposons i.e. their stability or instability, has been found to influence the specificity of their insertions into the genome of lambda att80 bacteriophage. During transposition from stable integration sites both transposons are inserted into the regions of the lambda att80 bacteriophage genome, definite for each transposon. However, during transposition from the site of unstable integration both determinants of drug resistance are inserted into different regions of the phage genome.
