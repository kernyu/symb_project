The prevalence of benzimidazole-resistant small strongyles was determined in a survey, conducted on 14 thoroughbred studs, which compared the faecal egg counts of groups of horses before and after treatment with the recommended doses of cambendazole (20 mg kg-1 b.w.) or febantel (6 mg kg-1 b.w.). Benzimidazole-resistant cyathostomes were found on all farms examined. Pyrantel pamoate (19 mg kg-1 b.w.), oxibendazole (10 mg kg-1 b.w.) and ivermectin (0.2 mg kg-1 b.w.) reduced the strongyle egg counts on these studs by 97-100% at 2 weeks post-treatment. However, 6 weeks after dosing the reduction of the strongyle egg output had decreased to an average of 67.8% (8.7-97.1%) with pyrantel pamoate and 51.2% (0-95.8%) with oxibendazole, whereas ivermectin still suppressed the egg counts by 98.2% (95-100%).
