Lyt phenotypes of interleukin-2 and interferon producing Balb/c cortisone resistant thymocytes, stimulated by concanavalin A in vitro, were studied using cytotoxic anti-Lyt-1.2 and anti-Lyt-2.2 alloantisera and monoclonal antibodies. It was found that while interleukin-2 was produced by both Lyt1+ and Lyt2+ cells, the ability to secrete IFN was limited to Lyt2+ cells only.
