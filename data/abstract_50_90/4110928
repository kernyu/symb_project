A strain (DA82) having peculiar osmotic properties was isolated in Salmonella typhimurium. The mutant shows increased elasticity of its cell wall and makes spherical instead of elongated cells, regardless of the osmolality of the medium. The strain withstands dilution in distilled water without disruption or death and grows normally in 0.1 molal NaCl broth (240 milliosmol), but it dies exponentially in low-osmolality broth (40 milliosmol). Addition of salts or sucrose instantly stops death and allows growth and cell division to proceed. Death is not due to lysis because this appears at later times and at a much lower rate. Osmotic inactivation is temperature-dependent: higher death rates occur at higher incubation temperatures. Inhibition of protein synthesis by chloramphenicol (20 mug/ml) prevents osmotic death. At 37 C and at lower temperatures, the phenomenon of osmotic death is transient. After a variable interval, growth of the osmotic-sensitive strain resumes. It is assumed that the strain's osmotic behavior is due to membrane defectiveness. The membrane disfunction and the wall defect shown by the strain may be consequences of a single genetic alteration or the results of independent mutations.
