Ten antibiotics were comprehensively screened for effectiveness against 105 microbes, specifically isolated from seventy-eight teeth involved with acute pulpal-alveolar cellulitis. On the basis of effectiveness and compatibility, erythromycin was regarded as the drug of choice for initial therapy. Streptococci were the predominant class of microbes isolated; enterococci were the most resistant. No resistance was noted wit erythromycin; 52 percent resistance was obtained with clindamycin. Tetracycline was the most effective of the common drugs for aerobic gram-negative rods. Polyantibiotic resistance was noted among microbes of all types. A clinical perspective in drug therapy for acute oral infection is discussed.
