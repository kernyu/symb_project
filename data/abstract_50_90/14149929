A survey of Staphylococcus albus urinary infections is reported from a general hospital. The infection followed urethral instrumentation in 75% of the patients, and was usually caused by organisms already present in the urethra. Novobiocin-resistant strains caused infections in four out-patients with no predisposing lesions or instrumentation of the urinary tract.
