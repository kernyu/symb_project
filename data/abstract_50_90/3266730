The susceptibilities of 52 clinical isolates of Bacteroides fragilis to five monoanionic cephalosporins were examined. Cefoperazone showed the highest antibacterial activity, followed by ceftezole, cefazolin, cefamandole, and cephalothin. There were two groups of resistant strains: one group (ca. 15%), of which B. fragilis G-232 was a typical sample, was resistant to ceftezole (MIC, 100 micrograms/ml), cefazolin (MIC, 100 micrograms/ml), and cephalothin (MIC, 200 micrograms/ml) but not cefoperazone (MIC, 6.25 micrograms/ml) or cefamandole (MIC, 25 micrograms/ml). On the basis of studies of stability to beta-lactamase, outer membrane permeation, and affinity for penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), we conclude that decreased affinity for PBP 3 may play an important role in the resistance to ceftezole, cefazolin, and cephalothin in B. fragilis G-232. Another group (also ca. 15%), of which B. fragilis G-242 was a representative, was resistant to all five cephalosporins (MIC, 100 to 400 micrograms/ml) and produced a high amount of beta-lactamase. Similar broad-spectrum resistance was seen in a mutant of strain G-232 that had a greater-than-30-fold increase in beta-lactamase production.
