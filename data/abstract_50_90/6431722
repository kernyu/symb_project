Sixty-four patients were examined clinically and immunologically at a long-term period following craniocerebral trauma. In patients with a history of head trauma impaired adaptation mechanisms were shown to underlie the neurologic disorders, which was reflected in changes in the natural immunity system. The severity and duration of natural resistance impairments were correlated with the gravity of clinical manifestations. The study of the time-course of natural resistance parameters allows the objective evaluation of the degree of central nervous system recovery following closed craniocerebral trauma.
