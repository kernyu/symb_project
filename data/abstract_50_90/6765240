Rifampicin-resistant mutants of Salmonella typhimurium were isolated and tested for pleiotropic defects in the regulation of pyr gene expression. Seven per cent of all the Rifr mutants were inhibited in growth by addition of uracil (uracil-sensitive). The uracil-sensitive phenotype ( UraS ) was reversed by arginine or citrulline, but not by ornithine, and it was suppressed by mutations in either argR or pyrH , which causes increased expression of pyrA . It was shown that the basal levels of carbamoylphosphate synthase (the pyrA gene product) was reduced to approximately 60% in the mutants, and that addition of arginine and/or uracil to the growth medium caused hyperrepression of pyrA expression. The expression of other genes of the arginine and pyrimidine biosynthetic pathways was not affected significantly in the mutants. The mutations were located in the rpoB gene coding for the beta-subunit of RNA polymerase, suggesting a regulatory function of RNA polymerase in the control of pyrA expression.
