Trends in relative susceptibility of clinical isolates, mostly from newborns with nosocomial infections, to the aminoglycosides in use in a hospital for children are described and related to practical therapeutic aspects. Currently, amikacin is the most effective of the available antibiotics against many gram-negative bacterial species, and its administration appears to be as complicated as that of other aminoglycosides. With 5 mug/ml taken as the cut-off point for susceptibility in vitro, 90% of 211 clinical isolates (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Serratia, and other species) could be considered sensitive to amikacin; the respective figures for sensitivity to sisomicin, gentamicin, and tobramycin were 80.5%, 66%, and 70%. Cross-resistance of microorganisms to amikacin and gentamicin, sisomicin, or tobramycin has not been demonstrated. Treatment with amikacin was successful in 13 of 15 children (premature and normal newborns with primarily septicemia); death of two patients was attributable to the underlying disease. For neonatal infections we recommend 12 mg of amikacin/kg per day; determination of the minimal inhibitory concentration for the causative pathogen and monitoring of serum concentrations are desirable.
