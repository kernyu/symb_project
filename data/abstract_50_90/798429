With the help of an analysis of the world literature pharmacological, pharmacokinetic and electrophysiological properties as well as the possibilities of the clinico-therapeutic use of Bretylium tosylat are demonstrated. The pharmacon is of increasing interest as antiarrhytmic, especially in the commandment of otherwise therapy-refractory ventricular disturbances of rhythm. A positively inotropic effect is proved. More severe side effects, such as arterial hypotension and increase of the pulmonary vascular resistance have an objection to routine application. The antifibrillatory effect needs particular consideration. This effect might promote this pharmacon to the "chemical defibrillator" in the emergency situation.
