Variants Br-0.5 and Br-1 of minimally transformed mouse fibroblasts of C3H10T1/2 line were selected for their ability to proliferate in the medium with 0.5 and 1 mkg/ml of ethidium bromide (EB) toxic for cells of the parent line. Karyological analysis of metaphase chromosomes, stained by Giemsa for G-bands, revealed the number of significant changes in the karyotype of cells resistant to EB. In cells of the resistant sublines the variability of chromosomes was higher than in those of the sensitive population. Two groups of cells are distinguished in the Br-0.5 subline: those with near-diploid and tetraploid chromosome numbers, respectively. The number of polyploid cells in the EB-resistant sublines increases up to 38%, compared to 2% in the parent population. The marker chromosomes in resistant cells originated from translocations, deletions and inversions, with preferential involvement of the material from chromosomes 1.4 and 6. The pericentromeric region of chromosome 4 and the distal region of chromosome I (region 1H1-1H6) were characterized by the increased variability and preferential involvement in rearrangements. In cells of both resistant sublines double mini-chromosomes (1-5 copies per cell) were found. The relation between the revealed chromosomal rearrangements and the mechanism of EB-resistance is discussed.
