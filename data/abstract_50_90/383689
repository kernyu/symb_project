By heteroduplex and hybridization analysis we showed that the inverted repetition (here called IS10) at the ends of the translocatable tetracycline resistance element Tn10 is not IS3, as had previously been reported by Ptashne and Cohen (J. Bacteriol. 122:776--781, 1975). Further analysis confirmed the homology between IS3 and the alpha beta sequence of F and demonstrated that IS10 was not present in the genomes of Salmonella typhimurium LT2 or Escherichia coli K-12.
