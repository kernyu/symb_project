Pseudomonas aeruginosa was cultivated at low growth rates under iron-limiting conditions on acrylic tiles. Biofilm cells exhibited increased tobramycin resistance compared with that of planktonic cells, and in old biofilms were more resistant than were cells in young biofilms. However, on suspension of the biofilm bacteria, glycocalyx-mediated resistance was lost.
