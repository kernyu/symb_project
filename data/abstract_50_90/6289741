A novel nucleoside analog, 9-[[2-hydroxy-1-(hydroxymethyl)ethoxy]methyl]-guanine (BIOLF-62), was found to have potent antiviral activity against herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2 at concentrations well below cytotoxic levels. For example, the Patton strain of herpes simplex virus type 1 was susceptible at concentrations 140- to 2,900-fold below that which inhibited cell division by 50%, depending upon the cell line used for assay. Different herpesvirus strains varied considerably in their susceptibility to the drug, as did results obtained with the same virus strain in different cell lines. BIOLF-62 compared favorably with 5-iodo-2'-deoxyuridine and acyclovir with respect to ratios of viral to cell inhibitory drug concentrations. Patterns of drug resistance to herpesvirus mutants suggested that the primary mode of action of BIOLF-62 is different from that of known antiviral compounds. Human adenovirus type 2, varicella-zoster virus, and Epstein-Barr virus were inhibited by this drug but at concentrations within the cell inhibitory range. Vaccinia virus and human cytomegalovirus were not inhibited at high drug concentrations.
