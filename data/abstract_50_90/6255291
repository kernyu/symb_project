We have isolated and identified an IS1-flanked transposon from the plasmid R1drd19. This transposon specifies resistance to kanamycin and is 10.4 kg long. It exhibits a frequency of transposition two orders of magnitude lower than that of the smaller, IS1-flanked transposon Tn9. We have named it Tn2350.
