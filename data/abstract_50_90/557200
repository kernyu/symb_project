Synchronous plasmodia of cycloheximide-sensitive and cycloheximide-resistant strains of Physarum polycephalum were labelled with 3[H]-deoxyadenosine in pulse and pulse-chase experiments in presence and absence of cycloheximide. The replication products were studied with alkaline sucrose gradient sedimentation analysis. We show that the action of cycloheximide on DNA replication in Physarum is mediated through the ribosome, since the ribosomally located resistance also makes the plasmodial DNA replication refractile to the action of cycloheximide. Cycloheximide caused inhibition of three stages in DNA replication in the wild type: first, the formation of primary replication units ("Okazaki" size fragments), secondly, the ligation of primary units into secondary ("Replicon" size) units and thirdly, the ligation of secondary units into mature DNA.
