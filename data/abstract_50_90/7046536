Twenty broiler chickens were fed bambermycins (Flavomycin; an antibiotic produced by Streptomyces) at the rate of 3 g/ton (US) for 63 days, and 20 control birds were fed nonmedicated feed. The birds were inoculated (dosed) on the 10th and 11th feeding day with Salmonella typhimurium. The study evaluated the effects of bambermycins on Salmonella incidence, shedding, and antimicrobial resistance. Bambermycins had no effect on body weights, duration of shedding of salmonellae, number of salmonellae shed on postdosing day 3, tissue recoverability of salmonellae, and total number of resistance patterns. Bambermycins resulted in the decrease of salmonellae to be more gradual; however, both treatments were comparable at the end of the study. The majority of S typhimurium from bambermycins-treated birds maintained the original antibiogram of streptomycin, sulfadiazine, and nalidixic acid. The salmonellae isolated from the control birds were more resistant to 2 drugs (varying antibiograms). Bambermycins as a feed additive in broiler diets given at the dose level of 3 g/ton had no detrimental effects based on salmonellae shedding and antimicrobial resistance.
