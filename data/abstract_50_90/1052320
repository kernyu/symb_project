Several non-lethal deletions of the broad host range plasmid RK2 (molecular weight of 37.6 . 10(6) have been produced in vitro. The method employed relied on the single HindIII restriction nuclease site in RK2 and the ability of phage Mu to insert and thereby add new HindIII restriction sites at various positions in the plasmid. The deleted plasmids have in each case lost kanamycin (Km) resistance, and in two cases are defective in self-transmissibility. The method used to reduce the size of the RK2 plasmid also results in the cloning of each of the two ends of the Mu phage DNA on the plasmid derivatives.
