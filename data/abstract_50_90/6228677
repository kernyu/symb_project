Subsequent to studies of clinical effects of spectinomycin (SPCM) and ampicillin (ABPC) given in combination on acute gonorrhea in female patients, sensitivity of N. gonorrhoeae to each of these antibiotics was determined. Furthermore, cervical discharge of female patients was searched for other organisms. Combined antimicrobial action of SPCM and ABPC were also examined. Aerobic and anaerobic organisms were obtained from cervical discharge of 20 cases of acute gonorrhea. The predominant aerobe (45%) was S. agalactiae, while the predominant anaerobes (combined 70%) were Peptococcus spp. and Peptostreptococcus spp.. The results indicate that mixed infections of N. gonorrhoeae and aerobic and anaerobic Gram-positive cocci should be considered in acute gonorrhea in female. MICs of SPCM for 20 strains of N. gonorrhoeae were determined. SPCM showed MICs of 3.13 approximately 12.5 micrograms/ml against 10(8) and 10(8) CFU/ml. There were no strains with MICs of 25 micrograms/ml. ABPC had MICs of 0.2 micrograms/ml against 10(8)CFU/ml and 0.1 micrograms/ml against 10(8) CFU/ml. Five strains (25%), MICs of which were greater than or equal to 6.25 micrograms/ml against 10(8) CFU/ml and greater than or equal to 1.56 micrograms/ml against 10(6) CFU/ml, were all beta-lactamase producing. In vitro combined antimicrobial action of SPCM and ABPC is additive.
