In a preliminary study a new antitumour antibiotic, adriamycin, was found to be capable of inducing complete remission in 6 out of 17 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and in one out of four with lymphoblastic lymphosarcoma despite the fact that these patients had either failed to respond or had relapsed after chemotherapy with agents recognized to be potentially successful in each condition. In five cases of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia adriamycin was used in combination with cytosine arabinoside-three achieved complete remission and two good partial remissions. This combination seems to merit further study in patients who have relapsed on the more conventional chemotherapeutic regimens in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia.In 13 patients with acute myelogenous leukaemia previously treated with daunorubicin and cytosine arabinoside no remissions were obtained with the dose range used.
