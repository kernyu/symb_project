It is referred to the possibility of the splenectomy in the early phase of the chronic myelosis in the time of the first remission. The intervention cannot be recommended generally and should be used only now and then in centres which have rooms at their disposal which are poor in germs. Own experiences speak for the fact to extend the polychemotherapy of the blast crisis of the chronic myelosis to its prephase, when an increasing therapy resistance occurs, the spleen becomes clearly larger, the number of blasts in the bone-marrow increases and single blasts may be proved in the peripheral blood. Combinations of two or three medicaments, such as Busulfan, Myelobromol, Merkaleukin, Methotrexat, Hydroxyurea, Alexan, Vinkristin or Rubomycin seem to be favourable.
