The transposon A sequence Tn1 containing the ampicillin resistance determinants was transposed from RP4 to a plasmid of the marine fish pathogen Vibrio anguillarum. Curing experiments in which plasmid loss was determined by analysis of the segregation of the ampicillin resistance phenotype showed the association of virulence with the specific V. anguillarum plasmid class.
