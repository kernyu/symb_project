A case of post-traumatic meningitis with otorrhea due to Staphylococcus aureus was successfully treated with a cefotaxim-fosfomycin (CTX-FOS) combination. Serial samples of CSF leaking from the ear showed that maximal concentrations of CTX and FOS, 3.24 mg/l and 19.10 mg/l respectively, occurred one hour after the infusion of both antibiotics was terminated. For desacetyl-cefotaxim (D-CTX), maximal concentration (1.24 mg/l) occurred two hours later. These findings suggest that lumber puncture to control maximal penetration of CTX and FOS into CSF should be done one hour after infusion of both antibiotics.
