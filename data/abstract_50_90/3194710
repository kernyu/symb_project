A total of 21 erythromycin-resistant strains were found among 355 (5.9%) beta-hemolytic streptococci group A isolated in Goteborg during spring of 1987. T-typing showed 17 to be T12, 1 T4 and 3 nontypable. Spread of resistant strains could be demonstrated within 2 families and 1 day-care-center. Monitoring of erythromycin resistance among beta-hemolytic streptococci is advocated.
