In our study of opportunistic pathogens, we have some indication that Staphylococcus aureus can increase resistance in mice against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Intraperitoneal injections of sublethal doses of S. aureus had a protective effect in mice against lethal doses of P. aeruginosa, more so if living and coagulase-positive S. aureus strains were injected. This protective effect was obtained both with laboratory and freshly isolated hospital strains. The interval between these infections can be extended from 2 h up to 1 week and it is still possible to observe the resistance phenomenon. The increased resistance was accompanied by a decrease in viable units of P. aeruginosa in the peritoneal cavity of mice 6 h after the injection of this species. There was no protection by S. aureus against Candida albicans in similar experimental conditions. These observations indicate that intermicrobial ecology, understood here as the previous presence of another species in a host, may be a significant factor in the resistance to infection with opportunistic pathogens such as P. aeruginosa.
