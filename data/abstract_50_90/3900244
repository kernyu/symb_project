Studies were undertaken in three independent centers to compare the newer, in vitro radiometric macrophage (M phi) assay with the conventional mouse foot pad infection for the diagnosis of dapsone resistance. Results obtained on 12 bacilliferous patients showed good concordance in both assays. One strain diagnosed as sensitive in the M phi assay was found to be resistant in the mouse foot pad. Three Mycobacterium leprae strains considered to be partially resistant in the mouse infection behaved as resistant strains in the M phi cultures. Attention is drawn to a rapid in vitro method for the identification of drug-resistant bacilli in leprosy patients.
