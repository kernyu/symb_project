The incidence of intrauterine infections following premature rupture of the membranes is high in indigent populations. In 1970 a prospective study was carried out to determine the value of prophylactic antibiotics in preventing puerperal endometritis in such patients. Penicillin and kanamycin were administered when the patients went into labor or when a move was made toward delivery by induction of labor or cesarean section. Antibiotics were continued for two days postpartum. Puerperal endometritis was significantly decreased. Six-year follow-up has shown no problems with masked infections, superinfections or changes in the antibiotic resistance patterns of cultured pathogens.
