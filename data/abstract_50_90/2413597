A study was made of the effect of an DNA methylation inhibitor 5-azacytidine (azaC) on the frequency of reversion to a thymidine kinase-positive (TK+) phenotype in 5-bromodeoxy-uridine (BrdU)-resistant subclones obtained from clones of Chinese hamster cells transformed by thymidine kinase gene (tk-gene) of Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV1). It is shown that in 8 of 15 BrdU-resistant subclones azaC increases 2-1000-fold the frequency of reversion to TK+ phenotype. Variations in the inducibility of reversions to TK+ phenotype indicate that the DNA methylation associated with TK- phenotype affects but differently tk gene of HSV1. Cultivation of TK+ cells of transformant clones in the presence of azaC may lead to stabilization (or decrease in the rate of the loss) of TK+ phenotype, or may not influence the stability of transformant phenotype. The reaction of TK+ cells of transformant clones depends both on genetically determined rate of the loss of TK+ phenotype, and on the structure of transforming DNA introduced to cells. A conclusion is drawn that the TK- phenotype of transformant clone cells arises due to processes which are not associated with methylation of tk gene of HSV1 in spite of the fact that such a methylation may later stabilize significantly the TK- phenotype.
