The critical inhibition of ribosome function by aminoglycosides has long been established. But the binding of drug to ribosomes is reversible: why then are aminoglycosides bactericidal? Several groups have shown that irreversible action (lethality) results from irreversible uptake into susceptible cells; conversely, resistance in cases such as anaerobiosis is associated with the failure of uptake. Oddly, the pattern of results excludes all traditional transport mechanisms; most unusual is the apparent dependence of uptake on the interaction of drug with ribosomes. A traditional view that ribosomes may function during uptake as a "sink" for aminoglycosides cannot explain all the data. Instead, the alternative is considered that cycling ribosomes at the cell membrane help to induce "one-way endocytic pores." Although no detailed mechanism is formulated, the results do suggest a way that the permeation of antibiotics might be systematically controllable to render them more cidal.
