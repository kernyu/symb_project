The reaction of cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II) and several synthetic or natural double-stranded polydeoxyribonucleotides has been carried out in the presence of such intercalating agents as ethidium bromide, proflavine, and acridine. After incubation of the reaction mixtures at 37 degrees C for 24 hr, some ethidium or proflavine, but no acridine, molecules are tightly bound to nucleic acids. Tight binding is defined by resistance to extraction with butanol, assayed by filtration at acid pH or by thin-layer chromatography at basic pH. In the ternary complexes, there is about one tightly bound ethidium (or proflavine) per platinum residue. At 37 degrees C, but not at 4 degrees C, tightly bound ethidium exchanges with free ethidium, whereas platinum residues do not exchange. The binding and the release of tightly bound ethidium are very slow (several hours). It is suggested that in the ternary complexes, nucleic acid-cis-Pt(NH3)2-intercalating agent, a bidentate adduct (guanine-ethidium or -proflavine)-cis-Pt(NH3)2, is formed. No tightly bound ethidium or proflavine is found when cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II) is replaced by trans-diamminedichloroplatinum(II). Competition experiments between cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II), poly(dG-dC), and poly(dG)-poly(dC) or poly(dA-dT) show that the presence of ethidium bromide, proflavine, or acridine interferes with the distribution of platinum between the polynucleotides. These results might help to explain the synergism for drugs used in combination with cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II) and in the design of new chemotherapeutic agents.
