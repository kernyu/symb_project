Coccidia were propagated from litter samples obtained from broiler production flocks being medicated with monensin. Eimeria tenella was isolated from 48.9% of the litter samples from which coccidia were propagated. Tests of the monensin sensitivity of the 73 E. tenella isolants obtained revealed no monensin-resistant isolants.
