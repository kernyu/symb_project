Three cases of H. influenzae type b meningitis with resistance to ampicillin and cloramphenicol are described. All infants were treated with new cephalosporin derivates. CSF sterilization was achieved in all patients. Clinical evolution was good in the two old infants treated with cefotaxime, nevertheless younger infant treated with cephoxitin developed serious neurologic and psychologic sequelae. H. influenzae b was erradicated of a carrier mother after four days of rifampicin therapy. Finding of multiple-resistance H. influenzae type b meningitis and therapeutics problems are emphasized by authors.
