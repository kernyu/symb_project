Streptococcus mitis resistant to most of the commonly used antimicrobial agents but sensitive to cefotaxime, clindamycin, vancomycin and rifampicin was isolated from conjunctival exudate of newborns. The isolate had group C streptococcal antigen, was beta-haemolytic on horse but alpha-haemolytic on sheep blood agar plates and might therefore be misidentified as beta-haemolytic group C streptococci.
