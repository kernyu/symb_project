A series of acyclovir-resistant mutants of varicella zoster virus (VZV) were selected in vitro by serial passage of VZV-infected human fibroblasts in increasing drug concentrations, or by continuous exposure of cultures infected at high multiplicity to 100 microM acyclovir. The in vitro susceptibility of these mutants to several antiherpetic agents was measured by the plaque-reduction assay. The capacity of extracts of cells infected with these mutants to phosphorylate acyclovir was examined and compared with that of their acyclovir-sensitive parent strains. Based on these studies, VZV could be shown to acquire resistance to acyclovir through diminished acyclovir phosphorylation. This was presumable due to loss of viral specific thymidine kinase (TK) function. Two acyclovir-resistant mutants remained TK competent but demonstrated phenotypic changes in sensitivity to antiviral agents known to act at the herpes simplex virus (HSV)-specific DNA polymerase level. These results suggest that the resistance of VZV to acyclovir results from qualitative or quantitative alterations in the virus-specified TK or DNA polymerase.
