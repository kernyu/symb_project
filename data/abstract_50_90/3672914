The disk method with Ericson and Bauer's solid nutrient media were employed to ascertain the drug resistance of a total of 54 strains of Escherichia coli, 25 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, 11 strains of Streptococcus pyogenes, 7 strains of Corynebacterium pyogenes, 7 strains of Streptococcus uberis, 2 strains of Streptococcus agalactiae, and 1 strain of Streptococcus disgalactiae isolated from utero-cervical exudate and milk samples of sows with clinical symptoms of mastitis-metritis-agalactia (MMA). It was found that gentamycin only suppressed 100 per cent of the strains. So far as the other chemotherapeutic agents were concerned the organisms showed a varying extent of resistance. After determining the sensitivity of the strains to drugs two groups of pigs (from which the strains referred to were isolated) were subject to treatment. All 20 sows of the first group were treated with oxytocin only, while the 446 animals of the second group were treated with gentamycin in combination with oxytocin. It was found that effective therapy in the case of MMA was impossible with the application of preparations on the base of the hind lobe of the pituitary only. It is necessary to use chemotherapeutic means tow which the isolated organisms are susceptible.
