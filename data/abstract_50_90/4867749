Enterobacter cloacae (strain DF13) was found to produce a bacteriocin which could be induced by mitomycin C. In the supernatant fluid of the induced culture phagelike particles were found. The bacteriocin was partially purified from induced cultures by ammonium sulfate precipitation and gel-filtration on Sephadex G-150. Ultraviolet-absorbing material was eluted from the Sephadex column in three fractions. The biological activity was mainly present in the second fraction and is associated with a protein with a molecular weight of about 61,000. The phagelike particles were found in the first fraction and show no biological activity. Upon conjugation of E. cloacae strain DF13 with another strain of the same species and with Escherichia coli K-12S, the ability to produce bacteriocin was transferred. The new bacteriocinogenic strain produced bacteriocin, which could not be distinguished from that produced by E. cloacae strain DF13. Although transfer of the bacteriocinogenic factor often occurred together with transfer of the ability to produce phagelike particles, it was shown that these two factors are two separate genetic entities. In addition to a bacteriocinogenic factor, E. cloacae strain DF13 was found to carry two other transferable plasmids: one determining resistance against streptomycin and sulfanilamide and another determining resistance against penicillin.
