In an attempt to investigate the possibility of re-establishing the use of penicillins in the treatment of gonorrhoea in Singapore, a series of studies were conducted between 1981 and 1984, to evaluate the efficacy of a variety of penicillin-clavulanic acid combinations. A total of 6 different regimens were evaluated, and we concluded that 3 regimens consisting of 2 doses of Augmentin 3.25 g P.O., 4 hours apart (regimen C), aqueous procaine penicillin G (APPG) 4.5 mega units I.M. + Augmentin 375 mg + probenecid 1g P.O. (regimen E), and APPG 4.5 mega units I.M. + Augmentin 750 mg + probenecid 1g P.O. (regimen F) were very efficacious against infection due to PPNG and non PPNG. The cure rates obtained were 96.6% (regimens C and E), and 95% (regimen F) for infection due to PPNG and 95.6% (regimen C), and 100% (regimens E and F) for those due to non PPNG. Regimen E consisting of aqueous procaine penicillin G 4.5 meg units I.M. + Augmentin 375 mg + probenecid 1g P.O. was felt to be economical as well as effective against PPNG and non PPNG, and had the potential advantage of being effective against incubating syphillis. Regimen consisting 2 oral doses of Augmentin 3.25 g, 4 hours apart was an effective therapy for patients who preferred oral medication alone. However, this therapy was most costly. No serious side effects of treatment were observed with any of the regimens used.
