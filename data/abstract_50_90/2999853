One-kilobase, direct repeats were found on either side of the chloramphenicol resistance gene of plasmid pSa. The right repeat corresponded to the region coding for sulfanilamide resistance. The repeats were not identical as judged by distances between restriction enzyme sites, hybridization, and by the ability to confer resistance to sulfanilamide.
