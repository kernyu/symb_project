The effects of five inhibitors of the cytochrome bc1 complex: 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (diuron), 2-n-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline-N-oxide (HpHOQnO), antimycin A, funiculosin and mucidin were measured in submitochondrial particles of strains of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae belonging to two classes of diuron-resistant mutants Diu 1 and Diu 2 which are modified in different exons of the split mitochondrial gene of cytochrome b. 1. The oxidation of NADH and of cytochrome b-561 exhibits a similar resistance to diuron and HpHOQnO in Diu 1 and Diu 2 mutants. 2. No extra reduction of cytochrome b-561 and cytochrome b-565 is observed in the presence of diuron and HpHOQnO. 3. Both Diu 1 and Diu 2 mutants exhibit the red shift of cytochrome b-561 induced by concentrations of HpHOQno 2 -- 3-times higher than those required in the parental strains. 4. The spectral and respiratory effects of antimycin A, funiculosin and mucidin and generally similar in the diuron-resistant mutants and in their parental strains. However a cross-resistance between diuron and antimycin A is indicated in one Diu 2 mutant. 5. From the combined genetic and biochemical data it is concluded that the interaction of diuron and HpHOQnO with cytochrome b is mediated by at least two specific amino acids located apart in the central region of the apocytochrome b peptide coded by mitochondrial DNA. These two amino acids control tightly the extra reduction of cytochromes b-565 and b-561 as well as the flow of electrons through the bc1 complex. However the binding of HpHOQnO required for the expression of the red shift of cytochrome b-561 is only slightly affected by the diu-1 and diu-2 mutations.
