The cat and tet genes of chloramphenicol- and tetracycline-resistant clinical isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae from Paris and Japan were shown to be contained in adjacent heterologous insertions into the chromosome. The two insertions transformed laboratory strains at frequencies that were low, unequal, and, for tet, very sensitive to the length of the donor deoxyribonucleic acid strand. In contrast, the transforming activity of cat was relatively stable. There was an unusual asymmetric cotransfer, in that a majority of the tet transformants also acquired cat, whereas only a few of the cat transformants also acquired tet. The evidence for chromosomal insertion came from genetic data showing linkage of cat to a chromosomal gene and from cosedimentation of cat with chromosomal markers in both velocity and dye-buoyancy experiments. Genes on a known plasmid introduced into pneumococcus from Streptococcus faecalis showed very different physical behavior. Most of the transformation properties of these genes can be readily accounted for by analogy to transformation of deletions of normal genes. Whether transposition contributes any of the transfers remains to be determined. The presence of one of the genes in the recipient promoted the integration of the other, demonstrating enhanced accumulation of heterologous genes by a process that did not involve plasmids in the species of concern.
