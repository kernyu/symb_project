The cardiovascular effects of an intravenous infusion of a 5% ethanol-10% fructose-solution was examined in 10 healthy late pregnant women with the method of quantitative sphygmometry. There are insignificant changes of the arterial pressure, but increase of stroke volume, cardiac output, work and power and a decrease of total peripheral resistance. In spite of these favourable hemodynamic alterations, particularly the constant heart rate, ethanol should be used only for a short-time-tocolysis.
