The possible direct role of inflammatory cells in resistance to Trichinella spiralis was studied by observing the effects of lamina propria cells from the small intestine (LP cells) of immunized rats on various stages of the parasite. Effects produced by physically disrupted cells were compared to those produced by intact cells on worms exposed to phytohemagglutinin or immune serum. LP cells were isolated from the rat intestine by collagenase digestion of everted gut segments that were previously denuded of epithelium by treatment with hyaluronidase. Disrupted cells, but not intact ones, selectively killed T. spiralis juvenile and adult worms in vitro, whereas larvae were unaffected by similar treatment. Attempts to identify the lethal component of disrupted cells led to an evaluation of the enzyme, peroxidase. Mucosal peroxidase is localized in LP cells and its activity increases several-fold during intestinal trichinosis. It is presumed to be myeloperoxidase, a particulate-bound enzyme of myeloid-derived leukocytes that functions as part of a potent antimicrobial system in combination with H2O2 and a halide. Results indicated that the vermicidal component of LP cells was associated with the pellet fraction of disrupted centrifuged LP cells, but was not linked to a peroxidase-H2O2-halide system.
