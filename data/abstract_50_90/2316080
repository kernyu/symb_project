Despite different treatment modalities, resistance to treatment is observed in 4-15% of patients with anogenital condylomata acuminata. A total of 16 patients with resistant condylomata acuminata or extended infection affecting an area of more than 6 cm2 were treated with a prospectively defined therapy entailing laser treatment and adjuvant systemic interferon-alpha 2B (3 x 1 MU/day for 7 days). Of the 16 patients, 13 (81%) were in complete remission after an 8-month period of follow up. The typical side-effects of interferon were attenuated in 80% of cases by simultaneous paracetamol (3 x 500 mg/day). The combination of laser treatment and adjuvant systemic interferon-alpha 2B seems to be highly effective in the treatment of resistant or extended condylomata acuminata. At present, these results are being tested for significance in a prospectively randomized study.
