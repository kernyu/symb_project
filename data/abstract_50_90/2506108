Incubation of protoplasts of Penicillium chrysogenum with the plasmid pBT-3 permitted selection of transformants on the basis of increased resistance to the anti-fungal agent benomyl. Transformants were obtained at a frequency of 1-2 per microgram of DNA. Southern analysis revealed that transformation had occurred by integration of vector sequences into the host genome.
