The implication of nosocomial infection due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa is demonstrated by comparing the bacteriological findings with the clinical picture of ten patients in a surgical intensive care unit. The occurrence of this organism and its resistance to beta-lactam-antibiotics and aminoglycosides is demonstrated. Ticarcillin was administered to ten patients following bacteriological and clinical evidence of infections due to P. aeruginosa. The pathogenicity of P. aeruginosa as an organism complicating the course of severely injured patients is discussed. Therapeutic consequences in regard to possible combination with other antibiotics are suggested.
