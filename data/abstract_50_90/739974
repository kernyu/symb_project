A double mutant strain combining two ribosomal mutations conferring resistance to cycloheximide exhibits a cold-sensitive phenotype. At low temperature the biosynthesis of the 60S subunit is impaired. Genetic analysis of cold-resistant revertants have shown that this double mutant strain can be used efficiently to isolate new ribosomal mutations.
