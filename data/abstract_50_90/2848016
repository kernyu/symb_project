We replaced the Escherichia coli lexA gene by a segment of DNA coding for resistance to spectinomycin and streptomycin. The use of this segment expands the range of selectable markers usable for allele replacement. The availability of this null lexA mutation will facilitate genetic analysis of lexA and the SOS regulon.
