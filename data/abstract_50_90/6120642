The sensitivities to amantadine and rimantadine of influenza A virus epidemic strains were assayed by the haem-adsorption reduction test in mouse Ehrlich ascites cells in comparison with prototype strains and a rimantadine-resistant mutant. Besides a majority of sensitive strains, two relatively resistant epidemic strains were identified. The possible origin of resistant strains and their importance for medical practice are discussed.
