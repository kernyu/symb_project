Temafloxacin disk susceptibility test criteria were evaluated by testing 697 bacterial isolates. Either 5- or 10-micrograms disks could be used satisfactorily. A 5-micrograms temafloxacin disk with zone size breakpoints of less than or equal to 12 mm for resistance (MIC, greater than 4.0 micrograms/ml) and greater than 16 mm for susceptibility (MIC, less than or equal to 2.0 micrograms/ml) is recommended.
