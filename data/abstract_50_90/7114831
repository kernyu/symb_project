Sensitivity of Acinetobacter calcoaceticus var. anitratum isolated from infected burn wounds was studied with respect to 24 antibiotics. It was found that the isolates were multiple drug resistant. Sensitivity was observed at least to 8 out of 24 antibiotics. The majority of the isolates were resistant to 10--15 drugs. Many strains were resistant to 16--17 antibiotics. 11 antibacterial drugs, i. e. tobramycin, sisomicin, gentamicin, amicacin, neomycin, carbenicillin, polymyxin M, erythromycin, tetracycline, rifampicin and dioxidine proved to be most active against Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. The strains were resistant to 6 antibiotics, i. e. penicillin, oxacillin, lincomycin, ceporin, fusidin and ristomycin. The activity of streptomycin, ampicillin and levomycetin was negligible.
