Pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) is the common precursor of several pituitary hormones including alpha-melanotropic hormone, adrenocorticotropic hormone, beta-lipotropin and beta-endorphin. The porcine POMC cDNA was inserted downstream from the late promoter of an SV40-derived expression vector and co-transfected in NIH 3T3 cells with a marker plasmid carrying the neomycin resistance gene. Colonies resistant to the neomycin analog G418 were selected and analyzed for the production of POMC-related peptides by radioimmunoassay. Three clones were found to produce from 350 to 1750 pg of POMC-related peptides per 10(6) cells in 16 h and selected for further analysis. The number of POMC cDNA copies integrated in the host cell genome was determined and the levels of transcription were compared. POMC-related material released in the culture medium by the best producing clone (NJP 4-4) was further analyzed by gel filtration and reversed-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography combined with radioimmunoassays. POMC was found to be synthesized and secreted without further processing or degradation. Negligible amounts of POMC-immunoreactive species were found in cellular extracts indicating that the prohormone is secreted from the NIH 3T3 cells without storage, presumably through a constitutive pathway. Our results suggest that NIH 3T3 fibroblasts do not contain the enzymatic machinery to process complex precursors such as POMC.
