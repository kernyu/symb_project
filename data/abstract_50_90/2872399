A risk-benefit analysis has been used to balance the risks to travellers of death from malaria against the toxicity of various drug regimens. The mortality of travellers who take no prophylaxis is estimated to be surprisingly low, and it is concluded that most travellers, even in areas of drug resistance should take only non-toxic drugs, such as a combination of chloroquine and proguanil.
