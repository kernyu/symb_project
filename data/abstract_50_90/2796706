The author is discussing the conclusions of C. de Souza et al on the resistance of Staphylococcus aureus to oxacillin got by studying the in vitro sensitivity to different antibiotic disks. Oxacillin appears to be rather subject to ageing, temperature and humidity variations, transport and storage. Utilization of Sensitabs pellets manages to gain more reliable results than with the usual oxacillin disks, and, a better rationalization in the antibiotic prescription to cure Staphylococcus aureus infections in Africa.
