Antibacterial potency of cephalosporins depends on inhibition (acylation) of one or more penicillin-binding proteins (PBP). Recently, reduced affinity of PBP for cephalosporins and other B-lactam agents has been found in some cases. Mechanism for these changes in affinity are analyzed in this review.
