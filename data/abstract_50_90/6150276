117 infants with gonococcal ophthalmia neonatorum, including 27 with infections due to penicillinase-producing Neisseria gonorrhoeae, were treated as outpatients with five different regimens of single-dose intramuscular kanamycin (75 mg or 150 mg) with saline eye washes, gentamicin eye ointment, or chloramphenicol eye drops. There were no treatment failures among 68 patients treated with 75 mg or 150 mg kanamycin and gentamicin eye ointment (for 3 days). However, the minimum and maximum cumulative probabilities of cure of single-dose kanamycin with saline eye washes (for 3 days) were only 60% and 89%. 1 patient of 15 treated with 150 mg kanamycin plus chloramphenicol eye drops did not respond to treatment. Postgonococcal conjunctivitis developed in 14 (12%) infants, of whom 13 had positive cultures for Chlamydia trachomatis. Nasopharyngeal infection with N gonorrhoeae was eradicated in 9 of 11 infants colonised.
