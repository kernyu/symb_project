This article describes a case of disseminated Mycobacterium chelonei infection in a renal transplant recipient. This patient, who underwent thoracic duct drainage prior to cadaveric renal transplantation, developed M chelonei bacteremia and numerous subcutaneous nodules a few weeks after transplantation. The M chelonei initially responded to amikacin and tetracycline. Because of side effects and bacterial resistance, however, these drugs had to be discontinued. Subsequent treatment with cefoxitin led to reduction in size of subcutaneous nodules, but control of the infection was not achieved until an intravascular nidus of infection at the anastomotic site of an arteriovenous fistula was removed.
