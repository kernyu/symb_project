Resistance to cefoxitin among species of the Bacteroides fragilis group of organisms has remained low (8%-10%) in a multicenter nationwide survey. However, a statistically significant increase in the percentage of B. fragilis group organisms resistant to cefoxitin was found at Tufts-New England Medical Center from 1981 to 1982. Non fragilis species accounted for most of the resistance. The presence of cefoxitin resistance in B. fragilis isolates correlated with resistance to other antibiotics. The presence of cefoxitin-resistant B. fragilis group organisms also correlated with the presence of other cefoxitin-resistant bacteria. No difference could be detected in therapeutic outcome of patients with cefoxitin-sensitive or cefoxitin-resistant B. fragilis group organisms, regardless of treatment with cefoxitin or other antibiotics.
