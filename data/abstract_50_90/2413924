It has been shown that the immunostimulant inosiplex (IP) is capable of inducing interferon production in mice and of stimulating interferon induction by high-molecular inducers. The combined use of IP and poly (G)-poly (C) or dsRNA (RFf2) leads to a longer interferon circulation in the blood. All the combination schemes ensuring the effect of interferon production prolongation were tested for anti-viral activity. The prophylactic administration of the drugs permitted the attainment in mice of the increased resistance to experimental influenza.
