The properties of stabilized alkaline 2% glutaraldehyde solution (SGS) are discussed. SGS is discussed with regard to its chemistry, antimicrobial properties, organic soil resistance, toxicity, corrosivity and chemical stability. SGS retains the maximum antimicrobial activity of alkaline glutaraldehyde solutions and the chemical stability heretofore observed only with acidic glutaraldehyde solutions. These improvements, along with the inherent resistance of glutaraldehyde to neutralization by organic soil, allow SGS to be continuously used for 14 days in situations of high dilution, or 28 days in situations of low dilution.
