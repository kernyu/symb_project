The 6(2'-methylpiperidine-, 2',6'-dimethylmorpholino-, imidazolyl- and triazolyl)-2-cyanopyrazines were prepared from 2-cyano-6-chloropyrazine. The -CN group was then transformed into COOH, CONH2, CSNH2, CONHNH2, CONHOH and C(NOH)NH2 functions. All compounds obtained were of weak tuberculostatic activity. Comp. 13 was active against isoniazide, capreomycin and ethionamide resistent strains at the concentration range of 31.2--62.5 microgram/cm3.
