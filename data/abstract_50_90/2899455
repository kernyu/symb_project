Two vincristine-resistant Chinese hamster ovary cell lines have been shown previously to be hypersensitive to the calcium channel blocker, verapamil. They are now shown to be hypersensitive to the membrane-active agent quinidine sulfate and to the calcium channel blockers diltiazem and nicardipine. Hypersensitivity to quinidine sulfate implies that calcium channels are not the primary target for these drug effects on these cell lines and is consistent with our previous observation that their calcium accumulation is normal in the presence and absence of verapamil. The two cell lines have elevated levels of membrane P-glycoprotein and of two cytosolic proteins, Mr 27,000 and pI 6.0 and 6.4. Revertants have normal levels of these cytosolic proteins, suggesting that these proteins may play a role in conferring resistance. [3H]Verapamil accumulation by the two cell lines is lower than in controls. One of the cell lines has been hybridized to normal cells and the vincristine resistance and verapamil sensitivity of three hybrid clones has been determined. Vincristine resistance is semidominant but verapamil hypersensitivity is completely recessive.
