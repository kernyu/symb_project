A microbiological procedure for determination of the group and concentration of antibiotics in combinations was developed. The method was based on the use of a collection of recombinants of test-microbes with episomal resistance (R-factor) to various antibiotics and their combinations. The collection of the test-cultures including 31 recombinant strains of E. coli obtained through conjugation provided determination of the concentration and group of any antibiotic in combination with the method of serial dilutions or agar diffusion. The antibiotics were the following: tetracyclines, levomycetin (chloramphenicol), streptomycin, aminoglycosides (kanamycin, neomycin, monomycin), penicillinase sensitive penicillins (ampicillin, carbenicillin, benzylpenicillin). The ranges of the research may be widened by including recombinants with episome resistance to other antibiotics or test-microbes with other species sensitivity to antibiotics into the collection. The procedure may be of use in experimental studies, clinical trials and screening of new antibiotics.
