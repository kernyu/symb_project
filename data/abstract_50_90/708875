The authors carried out comparative study of the incidence of spontaneous plasmide-negative variants occurrence in the S. aureus 8325phi IIde population developing under various conditions in vitro and in vivo. The mean percentage of such variants in the population developing in vitro constituted 0.9 +/- 0.2 in broth, 1.2 +/- 0.3 in the exudate, 6.3 +/- 2.0 in the population developing in vivo in the subcutaneous purulent-inflammatory focus, 9.5 +/- 2.6 in the kidneys. The mean percentage of plasma-negative variants in the purulent exudate in vivo was significantly greater than in the purulent exudate in vitro. The incidence of negative variants occurrence in vivo depended on the macroorganism properties.
