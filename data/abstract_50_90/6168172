The cells of a newly isolated neomycin sensitive and neomycin resistant strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa contained similar level of catalase activity. The difference spectrum of the cells revealed the presence of cytochrome c-554 and cytochrome b-560-. The presence of both cytochromes in the same molecular ratio in the cells and subcellular fractions indicates that they are tightly bound to the cytoplasmic membrane. The neomycin resistant strain contained five times less cytochromes than the sensitive strain. The lower cytochrome level in the neomycin resistant cells was found to be independent of the presence or absence of neomycin in the medium. The difference spectra of the cells and particulate fractions did not reveal any cytochromes of alpha-type.
