The efficacy and safety of ceftriaxone (Ro 13-9904, CTRX) a new broad-spectrum semisynthetic cephalosporin with an outstanding long serum half-life, was evaluated in 22 patients with chronic complicated urinary tract infections. Although the overall clinical efficacy evaluated on day 5 and 10 were similar, the rate of excellent effectiveness was higher on day 10 than on day 5. Eighteen bacterial strains were cultured from freshly voided urine. Eighty percent of the bacteria were eradicated on day 5 and 86.2% were eradicated on day 10. Bacterial replacement had occurred in 3 cases on day 5 and in 6 cases on day 10.
