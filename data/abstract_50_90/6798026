A recombinant plasmid was constructed by ligation of chromosomal DNA from a sulfanilamide-resistant strain of Bacillus subtilis to the plasmid vector pUB110 which specifies neomycin resistance. Recombinant molecules generated in vitro were introduced into a B. subtilis recipient strain which carried the recE4 mutation, and selection was for neomycin-sulfanilamide-resistant transformants. A single colony was isolated containing the recombinant plasmid pKO101. This 6.3-megadalton plasmid simultaneously conferred resistance to neomycin and sulfanilamide when transferred into sensitive Rec+ or Rec- cells by either transduction or transformation.
