Most of the known antibiotics interfere with the translational apparatus due to the extraordinary complexity of the translational organelle, the ribosome. After a short survey on structure and function of the ribosome the action of some antibiotics is explained and integrated in an extended scheme of ribosomal functions. Furthermore, various resistance strategies of the translational apparatus against the antibiotics are described.
