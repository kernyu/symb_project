Treatment of mice with Corynebacterium parvum enhances their resistance to encephalomyocarditis (EMC) virus infection. In EMC-virus-infected mice, pretreated with C. parvum, neither interferon production nor antibody responses were increased. A decrease of virus recovery was observed in cultures of macrophages taken from the peritoneum of mice early after injection of C. parvum and infected with EMC-virus in vitro. The data suggest that C. parvum acts by increasing intrinsic antiviral activity of macrophages.
