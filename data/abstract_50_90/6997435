Polyethylene glycols of different molecular sizes have been used to study the penetrability of the cell wall of Candida albicans harvested at the end of the growth phase and after prolonged incubation in the stationary phase. No differences were found which could account for the greater resistance of cells from stationary phase cultures of C. albicans to the antimycotic agents amphotericin B methyl ester and miconazole.
