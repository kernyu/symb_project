Differential light-scattering measurements of Staphylococcus aureus cultures were made before and after treatment with streptomycin. Changes were observed in the light-scattering characteristics of streptomycin-treated sensitive cells within 5 min after suspension in a hypotonic solution. No changes were observed with a resistant strain of cells nor with either strain in an isotonic solution. The observed effects occur more slowly when the cells are growing slowly. The physical effects consonant with the changes in the light-scattering curves are a broadening of the cell size distribution, a slight reduction in mean size, and the appearance of clumps or debris. We conclude that streptomycin rapidly alters the selective permeability of the cell membrane and makes the cells susceptible to increased osmotic stresses.
