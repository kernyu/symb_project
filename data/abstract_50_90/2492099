The compositions and partial structures of the oligosaccharides from the lipopolysaccharides (LPS) of a pyocin-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae (strain JW31R) have been determined by liquid secondary ion mass spectrometry (LSIMS), tandem mass spectrometry, and methylation analysis. Four major structures were identified with Mr 2123, 2000, 1961, and 1838, as well as seven species of lower abundance of Mr 1758-1272. The largest of the major oligosaccharides (Mr, 2122) consists of 3-deoxymanno-2-ketooctulosonic acid (KDO)-Hep2GalNAcGlcNAcGal4Glc2 (Hep, heptose) and phosphoethanolamine (PEA). The smaller oligosaccharides are truncated versions of this larger oligosaccharide. The oligosaccharides consist of a common triantennary structure containing KDO at the reducing terminus attached to a heptose disaccharide. A hexose (Hex)2-3 branch is attached to the heptose linked directly to KDO and a GalNAc-Hex3, GlcNAc, and PEA are separately attached to the second heptose. These oligosaccharides are the first structures to be determined for a gonococcal LPS and should further our understanding of the structural and antigenic diversity of these glycolipids.
