Serratia marcescens septicemia represents a serious problem in high risk critical care patients. Treatment is difficult because Serratia is usually resistant to most antibiotics. Amikacin is at present the most effective antibiotic in vitro against gentamycin-resistant Serratia, although significant loss of activity may occur in vivo in the group of compromised patients, whose ultimate prognosis may depend eventually upon other associated conditions. In this Medical ICU, 15 patients with Serratia septicemia who were treated with in vitro effective antibiotics (14 were given amikacin) had a mortality of 60%, while 5 patients who received ineffective in vitro antibiotics had a mortality of 100%. In this ICU, 80% of the Serratia isolates were resistant to gentamycin, while only 2.8% were resistant to amikacin. Because amikacin-resistant strains of Serratia have already emerged, appropriate use of this antibiotic is essential in order not to promote the selection of amikacin-resistant strains.
