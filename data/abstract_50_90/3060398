The data on allele interactions of nystatin resistance genes are presented. It has been shown that the mutant phenotype of heteroallelic hybrids NYS1, NYS4 and, probably, NYS3 is strengthened. The intragenic complementation has been found in NYS2 gene, allowing to imply the multimeric structure of delta 8----delta 7 isomerase which is controlled by this gene.
