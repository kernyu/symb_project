Strains of enterobacteria, isolated from pathologic material (dead pigs, birds, lambs, sheep fetuses, swab fecal samples from calves) were biochemically identified by the methods of Costin, Le Minor, and Eming. One-hundred forty of them proved to belong to Escherichia coli and 236 -- to Salmonella. The sensitivity of the isolated bacteria to antibiotics (ampicillin, streptomycin, tetracyclin, kanamycin, neomycin, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, oleandomycin polymyscin), sulfonamides (norsulfasol, sulfaguanidine, and sulfadimesine), and nitrofuran preparations (furazolidon and orafuran) was tested by the disk diffusion method. There was in a high per cent of the cases resistance to tetracyclin, erytromycin, oleandomycin, sulfanilamides, streptomycin, ampicillin, and comparatively well expressed susceptibility to polymyxin, furazolidon, orafuran, kanamycin, neomycin and chloramphenicol. Prevailing were the enterobacteria polyresistant to antibiotics, the observed resistance being expressed to 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 antibiotics at the same time (out of all nine of them that were studied). The only exception were Salmonella typhimurium and Salmonella dublin which were resistant to 2 or 3 antibiotics only. In connection with the data obtained on the tolerance of enterobacteria to chemotherapeutics it is necessary to reevaluate the programmes for the prophylaxis and control of diseases in farm animals and birds caused by Escherichia coli Salmonella spp.
