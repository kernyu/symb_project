The frequent and inappropriate use of antibiotics in hospitals increases the number of resistant hospital bacterial strains. Apart from Staphylococci and Streptococci, different Gram negatives--such as Klebsiella, Serratia, Pseudomonas, Proteus and E. coli strains--have been found in the hospitals and in the patients. Due to the resistance, it is difficult to find antibiotics against them. This fact puts forward the possibility of immunization especially by vaccination. Phenol-treated vaccine was prepared from the usual hospital strains and patients with colorectal cancer were immunized intramuscularly 7-10 days prior to the operation. The efficiency of the vaccine treatment was judged by the incidence of wound infections. The best results were obtained in patients whose previously estimated immunoreactivity was strong or normal. Immunospecificity could not be detected in the above treatment.
