The properties of 100 erythromycin resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus obtained from clinical material have been compared with the properties of mutants selected in vitro for resistance to erythromycin. The properties, including inducibility of the resistance and cross-resistance to spiramycin and lincomycin, of the two groups of isolates were always different. The risk that staphylococci will mutate to erythromycin resistance during therapy with this antibiotic is remote.
