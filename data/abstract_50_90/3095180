We have tested the hypothesis that genetic differences among conspecific populations may result in diverse responses to selection, using natural populations of Drosophila melanogaster. Selection for ethanol tolerance in a tube measuring knockdown resistance was imposed on five West Coast populations. In 24 generations the selected lines increased their mean knockdown times, on average, by a factor of 2.7. An initially weak latitudinal cline was steepened by selection. The two southernmost populations showed the same increases in the selected character, but differed consistently in their correlated responses in characters related to ethanol tolerance. This result indicates that the populations responded to selection by different genetic changes. Selection decreased female body weight and increased resistance to acetone, suggesting components of the response unrelated to ethanol metabolism. The Adhs allele was favored by selection in all populations at the onset, but increased in frequency only in the selected lines of the southernmost population. There was a correlation between latitude and Adh frequency changes, suggesting that fitnesses of the Adh alleles were dependent on the genetic background. Genetic background also had a large effect on the loss of fitness due to selection. Genetic drift between replicate lines caused more variation in selection response than initial genetic differences between populations. This result demonstrates the importance of genetic drift in divergence among natural populations undergoing uniform selection, since the effective population sizes approached those of small natural populations. Drift caused greater divergence between selected replicates than control replicates. Implications of this result for the genetic model of selection response are discussed.
