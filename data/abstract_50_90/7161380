A group of 254 isolates of coagulase-negative staphylococci were tested in parallel for novobiocin susceptibility by using P agar and Mueller-Hinton agar. Zones of inhibition of 16 mm or less around a 5-micrograms novobiocin disk on Mueller-Hinton agar indicated novobiocin resistance, as demonstrated by Staphylococcus saprophyticus.
