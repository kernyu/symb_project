The effect of antibiotic therapy on the intestinal flora was studied qualitatively and quantitatively in 41 infants. The results have been compared with 27 normal children of the same age and background. Antibiotics were responsible for the suppression of sensitive strains and for their replacement by resistant organisms but above all to a rapid multiplication of the intestinal flora. Colistin and pristinamycin caused these changes when given orally. Ampicillin when given both orally and parenterally but Colistin and the aminoglycosides when given parenterally did not have any effect. Fourteen cases of secondary septicaemia due to resistant organisms were observed but other factors were also important, namely the young age of the patients and intestinal problems (stasis and diarrhoea).
