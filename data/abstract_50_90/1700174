O-serotypes, biochemical properties and drug resistances of Serratia marcescens (129 strains) isolated from clinical specimens in Showa University Fujigaoka Hospital from April 1985 to March 1987, were compared with those of the previous results (Jpn J Clin Pathol 35:555-560, 1987). The isolation frequencies of serotype O 3 and O 23 strains were 35.7% and 8.5%, respectively. These strains with serotype O 3 or O 23 were wide-spread in the hospital. The urea-positive strains which occupied 61.2% of all isolates tended to increase more than those of the previous report. The isolation frequency of gelatin-positive and melibiose-negative strains was 85.5%. The resistance rate of all isolates to latamoxef and aminoglycosides significantly increased, comparing with the previous report (p less than 0.01, chi 2-test). The susceptibility of serotype O 3 strains to gentamicin and minocycline significantly increased (p less than 0.005). All of serotype O 23 strains were urea-negative. The resistance rate to kanamycin, tobramycin, gentamicin and nalidixic acid was higher than that of the other serotype strains. Furthermore, the resistance rate to ofloxacin showed the lowest (8.6%) among pyridonecarboxylic acids.
