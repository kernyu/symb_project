Although techniques based on immunologic or chromatographic analyses have been described for identifying mycobacteria in clinical laboratories, most microbiologists continue to rely on a series of specialized physiological and biochemical tests for this purpose. The recognition of additional significant species over the past decade has required the addition of more tests to the battery used for mycobacterial identification. This paper will review briefly the taxonomic status of species likely to be encountered in clinical specimens and the most useful tests for characterizing them. Strategies will be presented for using these tests in the most efficient way to provide optimal resolution of taxa without use of an unreasonably large battery of tests. A brief survey of techniques that may become more practical in the future will also be included.
