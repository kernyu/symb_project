The characteristics of 167 isolates of S. aureus from 106 mice suffering dermatitis were examined. All 167 isolates coagulated both rabbit and human plasmas and 161 of them also coagulated bovine plasma. All the isolates produced heat-stable and heat-labile DNase, phosphatase and yellow pigment, reduced nitrate, hydrolysed egg yolk, Tween 80, and hippurate, and grew on crystal violet agar in colonies of the negative type C and on medium with 10% NaCl. The majority of them produced fibrinolysin, protease and acetoin. Fifty-three percent were gelatinase positive. In hemolysis tests, 25, 57 and 45 isolates showed alpha-, beta-, alpha beta-hemolysis, respectively. Forty isolates did not produce hemolysins in the rabbit and sheep blood agar. All of 75 isolates tested produced acid from fructose, galactose, glucose, glycerol and mannose, but did not from arabinose, dextrin, inulin, raffinose, salicin, sorbitol and xylose. Most of these isolates produced acid from lactose, mannitol, sucrose and trehalose. All of the 75 isolates were highly sensitive to penicillin, methylphenylisoxazolyl penicillin, erythromycin, spiramycin, lincomycin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, kanamycin, gentamicin and cephaloridine, but were resistant to sulfisoxazole. With phages of human set, all 167 isolates were typable at 100 X RTD. All but one of the typable isolates belonged to mixed lytic groups. These were I + III (35 isolates), I + M (1), I + III + M (124) and I + II + III + M (6), with long phage patterns. When the 167 isolates were biotyped as described by Hajek and Marsalek [7, 8], 5 belonged to biotype A, 1 to biotype B and 60 to biotype C.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
