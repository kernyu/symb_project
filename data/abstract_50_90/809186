Antimicrobial activity of pure preparations of seven mycotoxins, coumarin and dicoumarin, was studied against various strains of Bacillus thuringiensis (Berliner). The acquisition of resistance to Aflatoxin B1, by a new strain designated "stable variant", obtained in the presence of mycotoxin lethal dose, is very specific. However, a relation seems to exist between Aflatoxin B1 susceptibility and sensitivity to compounds which possess a double furan ring. In vitro, coumarin exhibits an inhibitory effect against antibacterial activity of Aflatoxin B1.
