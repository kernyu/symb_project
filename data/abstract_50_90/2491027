104 patients with (UI) non-complicated urinary infection, diagnosed at the emergency department of a third level hospital, are presented. The median age (x +/- DE) was of 58.12 +/- 20, 48 years; 78 were female (73%) and 22 male. 81 had fever and/or micturitional syndrome, the rest of the patients were without symptoms. The most frequent germ was escherichia coli, which was isolated in 80 patients (84.6%) followed by proteus mirabilis in 9 patients (8.6%) and enterococo in 2 patients (1.9%), other differing germs were also isolated, one for each remaining case. The only active antibiotic "in vitro" for all the germs isolated was gentamicin; other showed varying resistance. The best effectivity "in vivo" was also obtained with gentamicin followed by cotrimoxazole, despite the resistance which was superior to cefalexin. There were no deaths reported during the ambulatory treatment. We concluded that non-complicated UI can be treated in an ambulatory regimen. The most effective antibiotic is gentamicin, cotrimoxazole being a valid alternative.
