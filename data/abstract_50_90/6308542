The in vitro synergistic activities of cefotaxime (Ctx) or moxalactam (Mox) in combination with gentamicin, amikacin, dibekacin or netilmicin were compared against 15 beta-lactamases non-producing or producing isolates of Enterobacteriaceae. The strains were classified according to their resistance to ampicillin (Am), carbenicillin (Cb) and cephalotin (Ce), but all were sensitive to the antibiotics tested in combination. In vitro checkerboard studies were performed using a microtiter technique for the selected strains. The FIC index was less than or equal to 0.62 for AmR CbR CeR strains (E. coli, E. cloacae, Serratia), for AmR CbS CeR strains (E. cloacae, Serratia, P. vulgaris) and for AmS CbS CeR strains (Serratia, P. morganii). These combinations were frequently additive (FIC = 0.75 - 1.0) against the AmS CbS CeS or AmR CbR CeS strains. Thus, the synergistic activities of Ctx and Mox in combination with an aminoglycoside seem to be correlated with beta-lactamase type produced by the Enterobacteriaceae.
