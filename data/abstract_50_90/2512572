The effect of low frequency ultrasound on various strains of tubercle bacilli was studied in 105 experiments. The analysis of the experimental results showed that under the conditions corresponding to those of dissection, sawing and sanation during the surgical operations the ultrasound had a bactericidal action on tubercle bacilli, both sensitive and resistant to antituberculous drugs. In 75 per cent of the objects there was an ultrasound-induced change in the drug resistance of tubercle bacilli in the direction of its lowering. Low frequency ultrasound had not stimulant effect on the growth and multiplication of tubercle bacilli.
