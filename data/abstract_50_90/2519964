In Aden, the incidence of diarrhoea among infants and children is still high. The present work aimed at investigation of Shigelleae and Vibrionaceae as etiologic agents of enteric infections. Stool specimens obtained from 1056 children complaining of diarrhoea were cultured on plating media and on enrichment media. Suspected colonies were then serotyped and antibiotic sensitivity tests performed. Seven percent of the specimens were found positive for Shigella strains. Shigella boydii was the commonest, particularly serotypes 14 and 1. Two percent of specimens were positive for Vibrionaceae, Plesiomonas shigelloides had the highest frequency. Several Shigella strains revealed multiple resistance to antibiotics, this was explained as due to a plasmid role.
