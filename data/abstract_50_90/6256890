The efficiency of vancomycin hydrochloride in the treatment of septicemia due to polyresistant aureus staphylococcus is illustrated by the observation of a patient affected with a necrotic and hemorrhagic acute pancreatitis and post-operative septicemic syndrome, which has been cured after a one-month treatment with a daily dose of two grammes. The vancomycin hydrochloride, because of its potential toxicity on the kidneys and cochlea should be reserved to the treatment of major staphylococcic infections. It could be prescribed either alone or in association, with a mean daily dose of 30 milligrammes a kilo, slowly administered by intravenous way. The side effects are prevented by adjusting the doses in case of renal insufficiency and by controlling the serous concentrations in case of a long continued treatment.
