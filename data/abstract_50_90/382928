Salmonella isolates from random-source cats designated for use in research were examined for antibiotic susceptibilities and the presence of plasmids containing R factors. The serotypes studied were Salmonella derby, S typhimurium, S anatum, S enteritidis, and S bredeney. Eighty percent of the isolates were resistant to one or more antibiotics. The greatest frequency of resistance was to streptomycin. The majority of the salmonella isolates transferred all or a part of their antibiotic resistance to an Escherichia coli K-12 recipient. Thermosensitive R factors were found in two S typhimurium isolates.
