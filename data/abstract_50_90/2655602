A non-steady-state model is discussed for the study of the interplay between beta-lactamase activity and outer membrane permeability with slowly hydrolysed beta-lactams. The analysis shows: (1) that the simple, steady-state model presented in the accompanying paper remains valid as long as kcat (i.e. k3 with chromosome-encoded class C beta-lactamases) is larger than 10(-3)/sec (generation time = 20 min or more); (2) that among the beta-lactam antibiotics studied here, the complete, non-steady-state model needs only be used in the case of aztreonam; (3) that the term "trapping" should be replaced by "formation of a covalent acyl-enzyme" and that such a phenomenon only contributes significantly to the resistance when penetration and hydrolysis are very slow and the periplasmic beta-lactamase concentration is very high. Aztreonam seems to be the only compound which fulfils the first two conditions.
