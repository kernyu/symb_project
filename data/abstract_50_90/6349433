Eleven patients with malaria seen over five years in one emergency department demonstrate a trend toward more efficient diagnosis and outpatient treatment. Ten patients were diagnosed using a routine Wright's stained peripheral blood smear (three fortuitously). Because treatment of hospitalized patients consists of no more than oral chloroquine, the current regimen allows for outpatient management. Determination of species and extent of drug resistance, as well as eradication of Plasmodium vivax and P ovale, are referred to a consultant after 2 days of oral chloroquine therapy.
