Conjugation systems that transfer antibiotic resistance in the absence of detectable plasmids are common in Bacteroides, but the mechanism of transfer is poorly understood. We found that linked transfer of tetracycline (TcR) and clindamycin (ClR) resistance by Bacteroides fragilis strain 1126 is induced by growth in either Tc or Cl. We cloned the transferable TcR locus as a 13 kb fragment on the shuttle vector pPH6 in Escherichia coli and showed that this region expresses TcR in Bacteroides but not E. coli. The TcR gene was mapped to a 3 kb region and the ClR gene was shown not to be present in the 13 kb insert. Homologous TcR genes are found in B. fragilis V479 and 1792. Using pulsed-field electrophoresis, the transferable TcR gene was shown to be physically associated with high molecular-weight DNA, suggesting that it is located on the chromosome. A new TcR shuttle vector, pPH7 delta 1.1, was constructed to facilitate use of this selective marker in Bacteroides genetics.
