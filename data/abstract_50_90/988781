Water containing ornamental fishes was found to frequently contain countable numbers of bacteria that were resistant to one or more antibiotic or chemotherapeutic agents. The multidrug-resistant strains most commonly isolated were lactose-fermenting Citrobacter freundii. The overall resistance of these aquaria strains was greater than the previously described resistance of clinical isolates of C. freundii. Although the strains examined appeared to lack R-factors, this pool of resistant bacteria may have public health implications.
