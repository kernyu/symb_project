Penicillin-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae from 405 patients were studied by determination of penicillin minimal inhibitory concentrations an penicillinase production. Eighteen percent were identified as penicillin-producing N. gonorrhoeae and the mean minimal inhibitory concentration, for all except penicillin-producing strains, was 0.805 micrograms/ml.
