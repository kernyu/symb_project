Severe staphylococcal pneumonia developed secondary to pyomyositis of the buttock in an adult male Melanesian in East New Britain, Papua New Guinea. Penicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus was cultured from the abscess, and S. aureus, together with Gram-negative organisms, were cultured from sputum. Despite treatment with high dose cloxacillin together with supportive chemotherapy, progressive deterioration of lung function occurred and acute respiratory failure developed. As suitable ventilators were unavailable, tracheal intubation was performed, and manual assisted ventilation was carried out for 4 days. Progressive improvement in ventilation and general status resulted, and the patient recovered without sequelae.
