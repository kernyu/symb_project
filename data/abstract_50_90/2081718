A cell culture technique was used to test the in-vitro susceptibility of the type strain of Chlamydia pneumoniae to 23 antibiotics including macrolides, tetracyclines and quinolones. The activity of the antibiotics tested was similar to previous findings with C. trachomatis. Clarythromycin had the lowest MIC overall (0.007 mg/l). Other macrolides were found to have similar MICs to erythromycin (0.06 mg/l). Both the macrolides and the tetracyclines were more active than the quinolones. It is proposed that the tetracyclines and erythromycin should be the drugs of choice for treating infections with C. pneumoniae; however several other antibiotics need to be evaluated.
