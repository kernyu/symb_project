An outbreak of nosocomial infections occurring in a postoperative intensive care unit was caused by a single strain of oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Six patients were infected, or colonized, by this strain, which was traced by using the following four epidemiological markers: antibiogram, bacteriophage type, capsular polysaccharide type, and esterase electrophoretic type. This strain was compared with S. aureus isolates obtained from the noses of 13 carriers from a group of 42 staff members. A good correlation in terms of phenotypic markers was found between the epidemic strain and a strain isolated from one carrier. Both exhibited the same pattern of multiple resistance as well as the same phage type, 77, capsular polysaccharide type, 5, and esterase electrophoretic type, 6. In contrast, an oxacillin-resistant strain, isolated from another carrier, differed from the epidemic strain by susceptibility to rifampin and by susceptibility to four additional bacteriophages. The other 11 strains isolated from carriers were susceptible to oxacillin and exhibited widely different phenotypes. These results confirm the interest of using several epidemiological markers to trace the spread of epidemic S. aureus strains and to delineate the carrier strains.
