Using DNA flow cytofluorimetry technique, the effect of ionizing and gamma irradiation on cell cycle in Chinese hamster cells of clone CHO K1 773 and of its derivative EBR-30 resistant to ethidium bromide was examined. Irradiation in doses of 1 and 5.5 Gr leads to a reduced rate of cell passing from G1 into S phase, to a prolonged S phase and to a larger postsynthetic block in EBR-30 cells than in 773 cells. Our data correlate with some delay in repair of gamma-induced (200 Gr) DNA single-strand breaks in the EBR-30 clone. Clones under investigation are not distinguished in their survival. Our results may arise from deficiency in some regulatory process usually involved in cell response to radiation-induced lesions.
