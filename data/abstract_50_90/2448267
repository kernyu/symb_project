Morphine pellet implantation in mice was demonstrated to diminish resistance to encephalomyocarditis virus infections. The variations in the response to three different interferon (IFN) inducers--Newcastle disease virus, Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide and a tilorone analogue--were evaluated. A close relationship between morphine dependence and IFN response was detected. A clear inhibition in IFN induction appeared as a concomitant phenomenon with the syndrome of morphine dependence. In the response intensity, the mice strain tested was more important than the total drug dose in the pellet. This effect of morphine on IFN responses presented a characteristic age-related pattern and, perhaps, may also be influenced by the H-2 murine phenotype.
