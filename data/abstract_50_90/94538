Four-week-old weanling mice survived, whereas 1-week-old suckling mice died, after intraperitoneal inoculation of mouse hepatitis virus, MHV-S strain. The factors involved in this difference in susceptibility were studied. After virus inoculation, differences in virus growth in the liver and spleen were observed, which correlated with the susceptibility of animals to the virus. Interferon, detected at an early stage of infection, was considerably lower in suckling mice than in weanling mice. Titers of MHV-S in peritoneal cells from infected animals were at least 100 times greater in suckling than in weanling mice, and a similar, but less prominent difference in virus growth was also found in the corresponding cultured macrophages. After transfer of peritoneal cells from weanling to suckling mice, a decrease in mortality of infected suckling mice was observed. These results suggest that both interferon and macrophages may be important in the age-dependent resistance of mice to MHV-S infection.
