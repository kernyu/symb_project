Twenty-three patients were treated with Augmentin for severe respiratory tract infections caused by beta-lactamase producing organisms. The success rate, clinically and bacteriologically, was 19 out of 23. One non beta-lactamase producing H. influenzae, and three mixed organisms including Staph aureus accounted for the four failures. The elimination of the organisms, sensitive to Augmentin were quick and clinical improvement was seen in 72 hours. The only side effects noted were nausea in three patients, which abated on taking the tablets with meals. Augmentin is a useful drug in the treatment of respiratory tract infection particularly in acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis.
