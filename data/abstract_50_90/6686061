The effect of the interaction between poly(I).poly(C) and cis-dichloro-diammineplatinum(II) (cis-Pt), its trans analogue and chloro-diethylene-triamminoplatinum(II) (dien-Pt) on interferon induction activity was investigated. The covalent monodentate fixation of the three compounds on N7 of inosine has different effects on the structure and thermostability of poly(I). poly(C) which is well reflected by the interferon induction activity of the samples. Thus, the sandwich stabilization by dien-Pt at low binding ratios is manifested by an increased interferon induction and a high resistance towards RNAase degradation. The destabilization of the duplex by cis-Pt decreases interferon induction, accompanied by an increase in RNAase sensitivity of the complexes. In the case of trans-Pt the duplex structure is little perturbed and interferon induction is essentially maintained.
