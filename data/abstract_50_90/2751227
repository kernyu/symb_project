A micromethod for the in vitro determination of Mycoplasma bovis sensitivity to antibiotics, based upon growth inhibition in liquid medium in which growth is directly estimated by measuring medium turbidity is described. The variability of inoculum density has little influence on corresponding minimal inhibitory concentration values. This method, regardless of the mycoplasma species used, gives results similar to those obtained with standardized procedures for other bacteria in liquid media.
