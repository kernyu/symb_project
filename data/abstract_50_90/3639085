Salivary samples were examined for a period three weeks before, and three weeks after the administration of 3 g of amoxycillin in ten volunteers. There was a marked drop in the concentration of streptococci in all subjects in the first 4 h but most had substantially recovered within 48 h. All had recovered at seven days. No strains were resistant to 1 mg/l amoxycillin in the pre-treatment control series, and no resistant streptococci emerged.
