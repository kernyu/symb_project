Two of six mutations at a base-paired site in Escherichia coli 16S rRNA confer resistance to nine different aminoglycoside antibiotics in vivo. Chemical probing of mutant and wild-type ribosomes in the presence of paromomycin indicates that interactions between the antibiotic and 16S rRNA in mutant ribosomes are disrupted. The altered interactions measured in vitro correlate precisely with resistance seen in vivo and may be attributable to specific structural changes observed in the mutant rRNA.
