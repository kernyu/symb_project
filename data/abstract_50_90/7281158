The antibiograms of the most important pathogenic bacteria isolated from pigs and cattle in the laboratory of the Animal Health Service of the province of Gelderland during the period from 1974 up to and including 1979 are reviewed. The findings are compared with those during a previous period. Adverse developments were not found to be present as regards P. multocida, B. bronchiseptica, H. parahaemolyticus, streptococci and S. typhimurium in pigs. Only pathogenic E. coli as the causative organism of oedema disease (colibacillary) enterotoxaemia) showed reduced sensitivity to co-trimoxazole; an increase in sensitivity to streptomycin, tetracycline and neomycin was observed. The pattern of pathogenic E. coli in breeding calves showed a variable, through on the whole not so favourable picture. There was a negative development as regards S. dublin in veal calves in view of the fact that sensitivity, particularly that to chloramphenicol and tetracycline, but also that to furazolidone and co-trimazole, had diminished. In the case of S. typhimurium, there was a relationship between the sensitivity pattern and a number of phage types. Ever since 1977, P. haemolytica has shown a diminishing and partly variable sensitivity to penicillin, streptomycin, tetracycline and sulphonamide. This was the case to a far less extent with P. multocida.
