Urinary tract infections (UTI) caused by organisms resistant to trimethoprim (TMP), as well as their faecal carriage were studied in two geriatric wards. TMP-resistant UTI was common (26 and 50% of admission and ward-acquired infections, respectively) and was associated with male sex, recurrent and transferred admissions and length of stay. There was a strong relationship between faecal carriage and isolation of TMP-resistant organisms from urine. Antimicrobial exposure was the major determinant of TMP-resistant faecal carriage.
