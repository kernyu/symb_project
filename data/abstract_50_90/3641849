Four commercially available slide agglutination systems for identifying Staphylococcus aureus were compared with the conventional slide (clumping factor) and tube coagulase tests. The systems evaluated included Bacto Staph Latex (Difco Laboratories, Detroit, Mich.), Staphyloslide (BBL Microbiology Systems, Cockeysville, Md.), Mini ID Accu-Staph (Carr-Scarborough Microbiologicals, Inc., Decatur, Ga.), and Staphaurex (Wellcome Diagnostics, Research Triangle Park, N.C.). A total of 338 clinical isolates, including methicillin-resistant S. aureus (n = 149), methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (n = 78), methicillin-resistant, coagulase-negative staphylococci (n = 45), and methicillin-susceptible, coagulase-negative staphylococci (n = 66), were tested by each method. The slide test for clumping factor, the 4-h tube coagulase test, Bacto Staph Latex, Staphyloslide, Mini ID Accu-Staph, and Staphaurex detected 212 (93.4%), 218 (96%), 223 (98.2%), 223 (98.2%), 221 (97.4%), and 224 (98.7%) of the S. aureus (44% methicillin-resistant) isolates, respectively. There were no false-positive results with any of the methods when the 111 strains of coagulase-negative staphylococci were tested. The results of this evaluation suggest that the four slide identification methods tested can provide rapid and accurate identification of methicillin-resistant S. aureus strains.
