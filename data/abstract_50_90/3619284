Hemophilus parainfluenzae may be a normal inhabitant of the pharynx, but it can have pathogenic potential elsewhere in the body. It has been identified as a cause of bacteremia and meningitis. The case discussed here represents the first report of H parainfluenzae-induced supraglottitis in a child. In reviewing its pathogenic potential in the upper respiratory tract, it appears that its major effect could be the ability to transfer ampicillin resistance to ampicillin-susceptible Hemophilus influenzae.
