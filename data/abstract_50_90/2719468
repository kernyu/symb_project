The MICs and MBCs for 90% of strains tested (MIC90 and MBC90, respectively) of rifampin for 75 clinical isolates of pathogenic coagulase-negative staphylococci (PCNS) were 0.03 and 0.25 microgram/ml, respectively, while the MIC90 and MBC90 of clindamycin were both greater than 25 micrograms/ml. Although no synergy between rifampicin and clindamycin was found among the 15 strains studied by the checkerboard method, 6 of 12 selected strains showed synergy by the kill-curve method. No antagonism was observed by either method. All 30 strains rapidly developed resistance to rifampin in vitro, and this could be prevented by the simultaneous presence of 1.0 microgram of clindamycin per ml in the 24 methicillin-susceptible PCNS strains. The synergy between rifampin and clindamycin observed in vitro for some strains of PCNS, together with the prevention of emergence of resistance to rifampin by clindamycin, suggests that this antibiotic combination may be useful for the treatment of infections caused by methicillin-susceptible PCNS.
