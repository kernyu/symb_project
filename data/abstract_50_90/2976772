An immunoblotting system was developed for typing of oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Clinical isolates recovered during a 40-month period at a single institution were evaluated with this typing scheme. Results were compared with susceptibility patterns and with bacteriophage typing results for 100 clinical isolates and with plasmid fingerprints for 14 isolates. Immunoblotting was found to be a useful method with good reproducibility that distinguished seven major groups of patient isolates that were clinically and epidemiologically related. Susceptibility patterns showed specific correlations with other typing results but were inferior to immunoblotting and phage typing for differentiating major groups of organisms. Plasmid profiles failed to distinguish two major groups that were readily identified by immunoblots and phage typing. There was evidence of increasing antimicrobial resistance of endemic hospital strains. Immunoblotting correlated well with phage typing, offered an alternative method for typing isolates that could not be typed by phage typing, and was superior to susceptibility testing and plasmid profiles for distinguishing different groups of oxacillin-resistant S. aureus at our institution.
