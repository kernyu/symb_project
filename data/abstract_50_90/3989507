A microtitre-plate method for evaluating the inhibitory effect of dyes on the growth of mycoplasmas in fluid medium is described. Different species were shown to differ in their sensitivity to dyes. Statistical analysis (a) compared the general sensitivity and resistance of different mycoplasma species to the dyes and (b) showed that the dyes fell into two main groups in their effects on the mycoplasma species.
