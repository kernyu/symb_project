The therapeutic efficacy of pefloxacin in experimental endocarditis caused by methicillin-susceptible or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus was evaluated. In rabbits infected with a methicillin-susceptible strain, 4 days of pefloxacin therapy significantly reduced both the number of bacteria per gram of vegetation and the mortality rate compared with untreated controls, and pefloxacin was equivalent to cephalothin. Pefloxacin was also as effective as vancomycin in reducing vegetation titers and mortality rate in animals with endocarditis caused by a methicillin-resistant strain. These results suggest that pefloxacin may be an effective agent in the therapy of serious infections caused by either methicillin-susceptible or -resistant strains of S. aureus.
