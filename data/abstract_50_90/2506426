A streptomycin resistant Nicotiana plastome mutant, X/strR6, was subjected to molecular analysis. In this mutant, a single nucleotide transition, C----T, in the chloroplast gene for ribosomal protein S12 alters codon 90 from proline to serine while the nucleotide sequence of the chloroplast 16 S rRNA gene is identical to that of the wild type. Mutant X/strR6 thus differs from several previously reported streptomycin resistant chloroplast mutants which are altered in the gene for 16 S rRNA.
