Supernatants of Con A-stimulated rat spleen cell cultures contain a factor that induces relative resistance to NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity in the YAC cell line, a line that is otherwise highly susceptible to murine NK cell-mediated lysis. This NK-lysis resistance-inducing factor (LRIF) has a Mr of 12,600 Da, as determined by gel filtration chromatography, and an isoelectric pH of 4.8. NK-LRIF is heat labile and is de-activated by treatment with proteolytic enzymes. Unlike immune-IFN (IFN-gamma), NK-LRIF is not inactivated by pH 2 treatment, and antibodies capable of neutralizing IFN-alpha and IFN-gamma do not abrogate the effect of NK-LRIF. Highly purified IL-2 preparations lack NK-LRIF activity. NK-LRIF does not induce a general resistance to lysis in YAC cells, because control and NK-LRIF-treated YAC cells were equally susceptible to alloimmune cytotoxic T cells. YAC cells treated with NK-LRIF showed a marked enhancement (5- to 10-fold) in the expression of class I MHC Ag. This observation supports the proposition that the NK susceptibility of target cells could be inversely related to the expression of class I MHC Ag.
