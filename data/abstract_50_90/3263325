Recombinant human interleukin-1 alpha augmented resistance of mice to microbial infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Salmonella typhimurium, and Candida albicans. The effective doses of interleukin-1 alpha ranged from 0.01 to 10 micrograms per mouse, depending on the infecting organism, route of administration, and challenge dose. Intravenous interleukin-1 alpha was, dose for dose, more effective than intravenous muramyl dipeptide and lentinan against the P. aeruginosa and K. pneumoniae infections. Augmentation by interleukin-1 alpha of resistance to infection was also observed in P. aeruginosa-infected mice in a state of cyclophosphamide-induced leucopenia. Interleukin-1 alpha may be useful for controlling obstinate infections not curable by antimicrobial agents alone.
