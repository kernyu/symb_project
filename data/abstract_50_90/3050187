Cefuzonam (CZON, L-105), an antibiotic injectable of cephalosporin family, was studied pharmacokinetically, clinically and bacteriologically to examine its distribution to female genital tissues and the activity on infections in the field of obstetrics and gynecology. Maximum concentrations in serum and genital tissues achieved 19-46 minutes after intravenous injection of CZON 1 g were 69.6 micrograms/ml for serum, 63.1 micrograms/g for oviduct, 34.2 micrograms/g for ovary, 22.5 micrograms/g for endometrium, 33.4 micrograms/g for myometrium, 30.7 micrograms/g for cervix uteri, and 37.1 micrograms/g for portio vaginalis. Clinical efficacies on 15 cases of intrauterine infection and adnexitis were proved with 4 cases of 'marked improvement' and 11 cases of 'improvement', thus the efficacy rate was 100%. Of 21 strains of aerobes and anaerobes isolated from infectious lesions, 19 strains were eliminated after administration of the drug. No side effects were observed. From these results of fundamental and clinical studies CZON appeared to be a highly useful drug fro the obstetric and gynecological infections.
