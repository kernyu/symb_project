The role of the host polymerase in Bacillus subtilis infected with phage SPP1 was studied in vivo with regard to production of phage-specific and host-specific ribonucleic acid (RNA) and to phage yield. Evidence is presented that the subunit(s) of B. subtilis RNA polymerase which is sensitive to rifampin and streptolydigin is necessary at all times during infection for phage production. The synthesis of phage RNA and the phage yield in strains resistant to either antibiotic were unaffected by the drug. Host RNA synthesis continued throughout infection; phage-specific RNA never accounted for more than 20% of pulse-labeled RNA at any time during infection.
