Microscopic examination of the articular cartilage of adult and young rabbits after daily intraperitoneal injections of 0.50 g/kg of nalidixic acid for four weeks demonstrated the presence of characteristic lesions due to nalidixic acid in the young animals only. No modification of the texture of the cornea or sclera was noted after microscopic examination of either young or adult animals, and no alterations were present in the juxtascleral cartilage.
