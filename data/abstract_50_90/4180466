From 1964 to 1967, 6,646 monkeys, representing 10 primate species, were examined for Shigella and Salmonella infections upon arrival at the National Center for Primate Biology. Of these animals, 12% were infected with Shigella, and 75% of the Shigella isolates were S. flexneri 4. The incidence of Salmonella infections decreased from 12 to 3% during the period of study. Epidemiological studies of animals in the colony for 90 days or more indicated no seasonal variation in the occurrence of Shigella and Salmonella. Many of the isolates from incoming monkeys as well as from laboratory-conditioned animals were resistant to chloramphenicol, dihydrostreptomycin, and tetracycline. The possible operation of drug-resistance factors in these infections is discussed.
