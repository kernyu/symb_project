Kanamycin, gentamicin, tobramycin, and amikacin are potent aminoglycoside antibiotics useful in treatment of infections with aerobic Gram-negative bacilli. For many bacteria, no other effective agents exist. These antibiotics must be used prudently. Prescribing physicians have a responsibility to avoid unnecessary therapy with agents that have the potential of causing serious ototoxic and nephrotoxic effects and to avoid indiscriminate use that may encourage the emergence of resistant organisms. These medications are much too valuable to be rendered ineffective by unwise use.
