One hundred consecutive donor corneas which had been preserved in McCarey-Kaufman medium and used in actual keratoplasties were studied. The residual medium and button remnants were cultured for bacterial and fungal growth. Coagulase-positive staphylococci were recovered in three cases, coagulase-negative staphylococcus in one and Rhodotorula sp. in another; no associated postoperative infections were reported, although one patient was regrafted 48 hours after the initial keratoplasty for "graft decompensation"--the initial button was not submitted for reculture. One additional specimen was processed. A cracked vial with clear contained fluid was held for culture; Pseudomonas cepacia was grown from the fluid. Other samples in undamaged vials from the same lot did not show contamination.
