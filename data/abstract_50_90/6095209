A vector molecule for the efficient transformation of higher plants has been constructed with several features that make it efficient to use. It utilizes the trans acting functions of the vir region of a co-resident Ti plasmid in Agrobacterium tumefaciens to transfer sequences bordered by left and right T-DNA border sequences into the nuclear genome of plants. The T-region contains a dominant selectable marker gene that confers high levels of resistance to kanamycin, and a lac alpha-complementing region from M13mp19 that contains several unique restriction sites for the positive selection of inserted DNA.
