The number of opportunistic yeast infections has increased during the last years. Therefore, testing of antimycotica has become important in terms of reliability and speed. Todays testing is essentially based on the disc diffusion susceptibility test and to a minor extent on the evaluation of the minimal inhibitory concentration. Two disc diffusion tests were compared. Both tests were shown to be practicable as a screening test. However, false positive results were obtained at a rather high percentage. Therefore, a new antimycotica test based on the disc elution test was developed and compared to a disc diffusion test. The resistance patterns for 5-fluorocytosine assayed by the disc elution test were in good agreement to the minimal inhibitory concentration. The test was shown to be adaptable for the imidazole-antimycoticas as well.
