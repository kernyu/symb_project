It was shown that long-term oral administration of rifampicin (40 mg/kg) to rats was accompanied by a marked decrease in the number of enterococci and staphylococci in their large intestine. A significant decrease in the number of colibacilli and anaerobic nonsporulating gramnegative bacteria was also observed. Discontinuation of the antibiotic administration resulted in rapid recovery of the intestinal flora with respect to all the indices tested. It was found for the first time that pregany of rats with experimental disbacteriosis was characterized by lowered colon resistance in spite of similarity in the intestinal flora of the experimental and control pregany. This was evident from increased periods of indicator microorganism retention in the animal intestine.
