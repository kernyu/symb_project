The activity of three alpha-(substituted-ureido) penicillins was evaluated in vitro against 599 clinical isolates of gram-negative bacilli, by use of the broth-dilution technique. At a concentration of 12.5 mug or less/ml, BL-P1597 inhibited 90% of isolates of Pseudomonas sp., 56% of Enterobacter sp., 67% of indole-positive Proteus spp., 72% of Escherichia coli, and 85% of Proteus mirabilis. BL-P1654 had similar activity, whereas BL-P1532 was much less active. At a concentration of 25 mug or less/ml, BL-P1597 also inhibited nearly 60% of isolates of Klebsiella sp. and nearly 40% of Serratia sp. BL-P1597 and BL-P1654 were as active as ampicillin and carbenicillin against E. coli and P. mirabilis. They were less active than carbenicillin against indole-positive Proteus spp. Both drugs were substantially more active than carbenicillin against Pseudomonas sp. A strain of Pseudomonas sp. which developed resistance to carbenicillin also developed resistance to the alpha-(substituted-ureido) penicillins simultaneously.
