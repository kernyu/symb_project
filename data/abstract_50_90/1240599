Sensitivity tests were done against two isolates of Scopulariopsis brevicaulis, using amphotericin B in combination with chloramphenicol, Chloramphenicol alone, amphotericin B in combination with 5-fluorocytosine, and 5-fluorocytosine, myxin and clotrimazole alone. Results indicated that the effectiveness of amphotericin B was improved in the presence of chlormaphenicol or 5-fluorocytosine. Growth inhibitory values recorded for chloramphenicol alone and combined with amphotericin B did not show much variation. Resistance of the fungus has been noticed to 5-fluorocytosine; but the organism's response was much better when tested against 5-fluorocytosine in the presence of amphotericin B. Both myxin and clotrimazole proved very effective and their ED50 was 50 and 2.5 mug/ml of the medium, respectively. Thus, clotrimazole may be the drug of choice in the cases of deep scopulariopsis.
