A polymyxin B-resistant strain of Proteus mirabilis was converted into L forms and spheroplasts in the presence of penicillin G. This treatment caused a 400-fold increase in polymyxin B susceptibility. The acquired susceptibility was in the range of the natural susceptibility reported for susceptible gram-negative bacteria ( approximately 1 mug/ml). The high susceptibility to polymyxin B was lost as soon as the spheroplasts and L forms were allowed to reconvert into the bacillary form in penicillin-free media. This behavior is strong evidence that the natural resistance of Proteus strains to polymyxins is due to the impermeability of the outer cell wall structures to these antibiotic substances.
