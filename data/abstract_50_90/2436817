Altered baby hamster kidney (BHK-R) cells which were subcultured in the continuous presence of HVJ (hemagglutinating virus of Japan--the Sendai strain of parainfluenza 1 virus) showed a high susceptibility to natural cell-mediated cytotoxicity, although BHK-R cells are not transiently or persistently infected with HVJ but contain the restricted amount of sialic acid. By repeated subcultivation of BHK-R cells in growth medium free of HVJ, the sensitivity to natural killer cytotoxicity decreased to the level of normal BHK cells with a counter increase of cellular sialic acid, and the subsequent treatment of the cells with neuraminidase caused a loss of proper sialic acid residues, once again resulting in a significant enhancement of lysis by natural killer cells. In the BHK-R cell system which exhibits a reversible resistance to the interferon action, the enhancing effect induced by interferon on target cell susceptibility to natural killer activity became more pronounced in accord with the recovery of sensitivity to the antiviral action of interferon.
