Fundamental and clinical studies of cefotaxime (CTX), a new semisynthetic cephalosporin antibiotic were carried out in the field of obstetrics and gynecology. The following results were obtained. 1. CTX was almost equally active to SCE-1365 and less active than cefotiam (CTM) and cefazolin (CEZ) against S. aureus, much more active than these 3 antibiotics against E. coli, more active than the 3 antibiotics against Enterobacter, equally active to SCE-1365 and a little weaker than CEZ against anaerobic Gram positive cocci, and superior to SCE-1365 and CEZ against Bacteroides. 2. CTX was more stable to B. fragilis-producing beta-lactamase than CET, CEZ and cefoperazone (CPZ). 3. The concentrations of CTX transferred to the female genital organs after CTX 1 g d. i. were sufficiently effective against facultative or strict anaerobic bacteria mainly isolated from obstetrical and gynecological infections. 4. CTX was administered to 10 patients with genital infections. CTX was excellent in 1 case, good in 8 cases and poor in 1 case. The response rate of CTX was 90%. Bacteria, isolated in 5 cases before CTX treatment, were eradicated in 4 cases. The bacteriological effectiveness of CTX was thus 80%. 5. No side effect attributable to CTX was observed.
