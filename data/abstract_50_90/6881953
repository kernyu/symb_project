Sensitivity of 120 staphylococcal strains belonging to different species isolated from newborn infants with pyoseptic infections was studied with respect to 13 antibiotics. Methicillin, cephaloridin, rifampicin, ristomycin, gentamicin and novobiocin were mainly highly active against the isolates, while some of the strains were resistant. The coagulase negative species were as a whole characterized by higher resistance levels with respect to some antibiotics, as compared to Staph. aureus. The predominant part of the coagulase negative strains with exceedingly high resistance levels did not belong to Staph. epidermidis. The sensitivity of staphylococci depended on the source of their isolation. At large the strains isolated from purulent excretions of localized foci were characterized by lower levels of resistance to a number of antibiotics (benzylpenicillin, tetracycline, erythromycin, methicillin and others) as compared to the strains isolated from the blood.
