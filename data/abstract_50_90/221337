By constructing crosses involving the genes coding for the enzyme deoxypyrimidine kinase and for resistance to the drug phosphonoacetic acid, it has been possible both to extend the genetic analysis of HSV-1 such that the eight possible progeny genotypes which arise from a three-factor cross can be identified and also to precisely locate the gene for the plaque-morphology marker syn, the gene for deoxypyrimidine kinase dPYK and the gene for resistance to phosphonoacetic acid PAAr.
