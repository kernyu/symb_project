Carbocyclic arabinofuranosyladenine (cyclaradine), a novel nucleoside analog with such desired features as hydrolytic and enzymatic stability, adenosine deaminase resistance, and low systemic toxicity, inhibited the replication of herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2. The 5'-methoxyacetate prodrug form exhibited significant efficacy in the topical treatment of genital infections by herpes simplex virus type 2.
