Antimicrobial resistant Salmonella spp. were found in double-crested cormorants and common loons in Florida. Single or multiple resistance occurred in all Salmonella agona isolates from cormorants, primarily to ampicillin, sulfonamids, streptomycin, neomycin, and kanamycin. Similar patterns of resistance were found in S. agona isolates from common loons. In addition, isolates of S. Saint paul from loons were found resistant to tetracycline and streptomycin, while 2 of 7 isolates of S. infantis were resistant to tetracycline only.
