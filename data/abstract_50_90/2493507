To test the hypothesis that susceptibility to NK cell-mediated cytolysis varies inversely with the levels of target cell class I HLA expression, NK-susceptible K562 and MOLT-4 target cells have been transfected via electroporation with cloned human class I HLA-A2 and HLA-B7 genes. Stably transfected cells expressing varying levels of cell-surface class I HLA have been selected by fluorescent activated cell sorting and tested for susceptibility to NK-mediated cytolysis by freshly isolated peripheral blood NK cells from nine normal volunteers as well as by cloned human NK effectors and tumor cells from a patient with an NK cell lymphoproliferative disorder. Expression of class I HLA did not alter the susceptibility of K562 or MOLT-4 target cells to NK-mediated cytolysis by any of the effectors tested. In addition, the class I HLA-expressing transfectant cells were identical to mock transfected cells in their ability to compete for lysis in cold target inhibition assays. Treatment of both mock-transfected and class I HLA-transfected K562 cells with IFN-gamma resulted in decreased susceptibility to NK-mediated cytolysis which was independent of the total level of class I HLA expression. These results demonstrate that the level of target cell class I HLA expression is not sufficient to determine susceptibility or resistance to NK-mediated cytolysis of the classical NK targets K562 and MOLT-4.
