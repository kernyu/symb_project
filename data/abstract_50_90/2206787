1. The multiple-dose kinetics of dapsone (DDS), its major metabolite monoacetyldapsone (MADDS) and pyrimethamine (PYR) were studied in six healthy adult male volunteers following weekly administration of Maloprim (100 mg DDS plus 12.5 mg PYR). 2. After the last maintenance dose of Maloprim, the following kinetic parameters (mean values) were determined for DDS and PYR, respectively: maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) = 1,134 and 116 ng ml-1; elimination half-life (t1/2) = 23 and 105 h; plasma clearance (CL) = 37.6 and 15.9 ml h-1 kg-1 and apparent volume of distribution (Vss) = 1.20 and 2.29 l kg-1. The mean t1/2 of MADDS was 22 h. 3. The mean whole blood to plasma (B/P) and erythrocyte to plasma (E/P) concentration ratios for DDS were 1.04 and 1.09, respectively. MADDS had a B/P ratio of 0.69 and an E/P ratio of 0.33. The B/P and E/P ratios for PYR were 0.98 and 0.54, respectively. 4. The drug combination was assessed in vitro by measuring inhibition of re-invasion of two Plasmodium falciparum isolates grown in the presence of volunteers' sera. The chloroquine (CQ)- and PYR-sensitive FC-27 isolate was completely inhibited by the sera but the drug combination was ineffective against the CQ- and PYR-resistant K1 strain. The in vitro findings suggest that Maloprim may not be effective against strains of P. falciparum with a high level of resistance to pyrimethamine.
