High level lincomycin resistant strains of Escherichia coli were isolated and screened for altered ribosomal proteins and functions. Amongst 58 strains investigated by electrophoresis one had an altered ribosomal protein S7, another one a mutated L14 and two showed altered L15 proteins. A correlation between these alterations and lincomycin resistant growth could not be demonstrated by genetic analysis for any of the mutants. In vitro, however, extracts from the two L15 mutants were less sensitive to inhibition by the drug. A gene locus (linR) responsible for the lincomycin resistance phenotype was mapped at min 30 of the Escherichia coli chromosome near tyrR; it seems to be identical to the previously described linB locus (Apirion, 1967); however, in contrast to these reports it does not seem to alter any ribosomal function.
