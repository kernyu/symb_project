In 1977, from March through April, 16 strains of N. meningitidis were isolated among 400 healthy subjects: 334 school-children 6-11 years of age and 66 adults, with a carrier rate of 3.85% and 4.5% respectively. The serological identification carried out by slide agglutination showed: 1 strain belonging to serogroup A; 4 strains to serogroup B; 1 strain to serogroup C; 1 strain to serogroup Y; 3 strains were autoagglutinable and 5 nonagglutinable. Minimum inhibiting concentrations of sulfamethoxypyrazine and some antibiotics (penicillin, streptomycin, rifampicin, chloramphenicol, chlortetracyclin) were determined for 12 strains. All the isolates were inhibited by a concentration of rifampicin of 0.2 microgram/ml, whereas 2 strains were resistant, respectively, to 0.8 UI/ml of penicillin (M.I.C. greater than 0.8 less than or equal to 1 UI/ml) and to 4 UI/ml (M.I.C. greater than 4 less than or equal to 6 UI/ml). Various levels of resistance to sulfamethoxypyrazine and other antibiotics were also noted.
