This article reviews some of the more recent developments relating to the clinical usage of erythromycin. The bactericidal and tissue-penetrating properties of this antibiotic are described and the suggestion that erythromycin has a very useful spectrum of activity in respiratory tract infections is supported by a variety of studies. We examine the increasing application of erythromycin in an extending number of problems such as sexually acquired disorders, a variety of diseases produced by infection with Legionella species and the enteritides associted with Campylobacter and Shigella species. The influence of erythromycin in particular, and of antimicrobial agents in general, on the immune system of the host is discussed. The immunomodulatory capacity of the antibiotics used deserves more attention. The interactions of erythromycin with theophylines and with carbamazepine are noted and amplified, and the consequences of the binding of erythromycin to plasma alpha 1-glycoprotein are examined. After some 3 decades of use, this remarkably safe antibiotic continues to display activities which deserve the attention of the clinician.
