Strain PP808 of Pseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolicola contains pEXC8080 (34.6 kb), the smallest of several plasmids that originated by partial excision of the cryptic plasmid, pMMC7105 (150 kb), from the host chromosome. This excision plasmid is derived entirely of sequences from pMMC7105 and contains a 24 kb region referred to as common DNA, which is present in each of the other excision plasmids. A six enzyme restriction endonuclease map was constructed of pEXC8080. The replication region was mapped by identifying small restriction fragments that conferred replication properties to pMB1 plasmids that otherwise fail to replicate in Pseudomonas. This region is located within the common DNA and is 0.8-3.8 kb in size. Sequences from pEXC8080 failed to stabilize pMB1 derivatives in Pseudomonas in the absence of antibiotic selection, but stability functions were mapped to a region of pMMC7105 that presumably remains integrated in the chromosome of strain PP808. An incompatibility region was mapped to a 7.3 kb region on pEXC8080 that is closely linked to, but not included within, the replication region. The recombination site was mapped to a 1.2 kb region of the fusion fragment that was formed upon excision of pEXC8080. RS-I, a repetitive sequence found on pMMC7105 was present in the fusion fragment at the site of recombination. RS-I was also mapped to BamHI fragments that recombined upon excision of pEXC8080 and suggest that it provides sites for homologous recombination.
