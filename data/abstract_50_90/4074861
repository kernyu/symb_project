Contractile function of the isolated right atrium was studied in male Wistar rats adapted to short-term stressor exposures at varying times after adaptation was completed. Adaptation to short-term stressor exposures induced a limited decrease in myocardial contractility immediately after adaptation was over. On the 3d day an additional reduction in the characteristics of contractile function was still observed. However, by the 5th day the characteristics recovered to the control level. At the same time adaptation completely prevented the derangement of myocardial contractility, induced by exposure to a prolonged stress. That protective effect was observed as early as adaptation was completed, on days 3 and 5 after adaptation, and became lessened on the 10th day. It is assumed that on the 5th day after adaptation the animals are in a postadaptation state where the untoward effect of adaptation disappears whereas the protective effect is demonstrable to a full extent. As a result all the characteristics of myocardial contractility following a prolonged stress on the 5th day after completion of short-term stressor exposures differed in no way from the control parameters.
