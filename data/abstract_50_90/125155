Symbiotic effectiveness of 45 mutant strains selected from four wild effective strains of Rhizobium leguminosarum for resistance to streptomycin, spectinomycin or kanamycin was determined on Vicia faba. Loss of effectiveness occurred in twenty of these mutants; distribution of ineffective mutants was uniform among the three types of antibiotic resistant mutants but varied with the parent strain from which mutants have been derived.
