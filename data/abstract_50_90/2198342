7-(2-Aminoethoxy)-, 7-(2-aminoethylthio)-, and 7-(2-aminoethylamino)-1-cyclopropyl-6-fluoro-1,4-dihydro-4-oxoq uin oline-3- carboxylic acids and their derivatives (11a--f, h, j, k, 12a--f, and 13a--f) were synthesized and their antibacterial activities were tested. Among them, compounds (13a, d) having a primary amino group at the terminal position of alkoxy and alkylthio groups were found to have excellent in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activity comparable to those of ciprofloxacin (5). Structure-activity relationship of these compounds was also stated.
