Tinidazole in capsules was given orally in doses of 150 mg twice per day for 7 days to ten subjects. Saliva, throat, and faecal specimens were taken up to 16 days after administration for cultivation of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria and for assay of tinidazole. Mean peak serum levels of tinidazole varied between 3.3 microgram/ml to 5.4 microgram/ml. The saliva concentrations of tinidazole were between 2.9 microgram/ml to 5.9 microgram/ml. No concentration of tinidazole was detected in faeces. In saliva, a slight decrease in the numbers of fusobacteria was found, but no other changes in the oral, throat, or colon microflora were observed.
