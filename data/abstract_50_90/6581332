Cefotetan (CTT), a new cephamycin antibiotic, was administered to 21 pediatric patients, 1 year and 1 month to 9 years of age, with moderate or severe infections. CTT was intravenously administered 3 times a day at daily doses of 26.5 to 120 mg/kg for 2 to 14 days, and 0.75 to 31.0 g of the drug were totally given. Total of 21 cases, 12 cases of respiratory tract infections (each 1 case of acute pharyngitis, acute tonsillitis and asthmatic bronchitis, 6 cases of acute pneumonia, 1 case of lung fibrosis and 2 cases of primary atypical pneumonia), 2 cases of urinary tract infections, 1 case of acute appendicitis, 1 case of perianal abscess, 2 cases of sepsis, 1 case of MCLS, 1 case of ReYE's syndrome and 1 case of meningoencephalitis, were received CTT. Five cases were excluded for the evaluation of clinical efficacy, and good response were obtained in 11 cases (effective rate of 68.8%), fair in 1 and poor in 4. Out of 3 strains of causative organisms isolated before the treatment, H. influenzae and K. pneumoniae were disappeared after the CTT treatment, S. faecalis which was resistant against CTT persisted. Neither adverse effects nor abnormal laboratory findings were observed except 1 case of eosinophilia.
