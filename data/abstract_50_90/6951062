Fundamental and clinical studies were carried out to objectively evaluate the effectiveness and safety of cefmetazole (CMZ) in the treatment of S. aureus infections of the skin, and the following results were obtained. 1. Blisters are induced with cantharis ointment to determine transfer of CMZ and cefazolin (CEZ) into the sclerosity and skin. The sensitivity of clinically isolated S. aureus was measured to these drugs. 2. In case of CMZ, antibacterial activity, exudate and tissue transfer were favorable, and the sclerosity and skin concentration of the drug was such that it covered the major portion of MIC distribution of the clinically isolated S. aureus. 3. In the crossover test following one shot intravenous injection of CMZ and CEZ at the doses of 1 g, drug concentrations in the serosity and skin were higher after CMZ as compared with those after CEZ. 4. Clinical effect of this drug in the treatment of S. aureus infections of the skin in 10 cases was such that it was markedly effective in 4 cases, moderately effective in 4 and slightly effective in 2 cases. Bacteriological, effect of CMZ was eradication of the bacteria in 9 cases and change of bacterial flora in 1 case. In addition, the clinical effect of the drug in 2 cases in which cephalexin had been ineffective was that it was markedly effective in 1 and slightly effective in the other. 5. Side effect was not observed in any of the treated cases. From the above, it was concluded that CMZ is highly useful drug in the treatment of S. aureus infections of the skin.
