The in vitro activity of 4 beta lactam compounds (carbenicillin, ampicillin, cefotaxim, azlocillin), 4 aminoglycosides (gentamicin, dibekacin, netilmicin, amikacin), chloramphenicol and tetracyclin chlorhydrate was studied on 30 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Amikacin is the most efficient with 97% of sensitive strains, then dibekacin (80%), azlocillin (76%) and carbenicillin (73%). Gentamicin and netilmicin are the less efficient with respectively 43% and 63% resistant strains. Chloramphenicol, ampicillin and cefotaxim have not any activity on these strains. This study reveals that 3% of the strains are polyresistant.
