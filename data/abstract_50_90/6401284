Treatment of penicillin-sensitive and intrinsically resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae strains with their respective inhibitory concentrations of penicillin caused rapid cell death. When the peptidoglycan syntheses of these two strains were examined in the presence of penicillin, the sensitive strain continued to make this cell wall polymer for an extended time, whereas the resistant strain underwent a rapid and marked depression in synthesis. Examination of the labeled sodium dodecyl sulfate-insoluble peptidoglycan made in the presence of inhibitory concentrations of penicillin revealed further differences. The primary effect on the penicillin-sensitive gonococcus was a slight change in peptide cross-linking and a sharp decline in the degree of O-acetylation. In contrast, the resistant strain exhibited a substantial decline in cross-linking, with a very moderate change in O-acetylation. The degree of saturation of the individual penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) was assessed under these conditions. PBP 2, which exhibits a reduced affinity for penicillin in the resistant strain, appeared to be related to O-acetylation, whereas PBP 1 was implicated in the transpeptidation reaction.
