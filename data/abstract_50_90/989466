DNA/cell distributions were recorded by automated cytofluorometry (=pulse cytophotometry) in bone-marrow aspirates of leukaemia and lymphosarcoma patients subjected to chemotherapy. In most cases, early perturbations in DNA/cell histographs were observed, characteristically reflecting the known mode of action of the drugs. These changes in general preceded the clinical observation of drug response. In a series of 23 measurements in 19 patients, a positive correlation between early cytophotometric changes and clinical effects of chemotherapy was observed in 17 patients. Five patients were negative for both cytophotometric and clinical reactions and one patient was probably false-positive. The validity of the assay for early detection of drug resistance in acute leukaemia and related diseases is discussed.
