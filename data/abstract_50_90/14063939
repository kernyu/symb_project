Gonorrhea has increased in incidence over the past five years in Manitoba as elsewhere. Cases which did not respond to routine penicillin treatment were noted to be occuring more often. In 1948, strains of N. gonorrhoeae isolated in Canada were all sensitive to 0.06 unit of penicillin per c.c. in vitro. Commencing in May 1962, strains of N. gonorrhoeae were isolated from 100 patients of each sex attending the clinic at the St. Boniface General Hospital. Eighteen per cent required concentrations of more than 0.05 unit of penicillin per ml. to inhibit growth; 31% were not inhibited by the 2 mug. disc of dihydrostreptomycin; but only one strain was found resistant to sulfisoxazole and none to oxytetracycline. Results of penicillin treatment were markedly less successful in the patients with strains that demonstrated reduced penicillin sensitivity. Use of streptomycin and a sulfonamide proved to be a satisfactory substitute. Intramuscular oxytetracycline was less successful despite the laboratory findings.
