Exudates from bacterial infections of oral soft tissues were cultured and tested for antiobiotic susceptibility. Of 74 specimens tested, 68 were cultivable on blood agar; 56 of the cultivable exudates were pure cultures and 12 were mixed cultures. Strepococci and staphylococci accounted for 57% and 34%, respectively, of the pure cultures. Anaerobic bacteria were found in nearly 15% of the pure culture exudates. Gramnegative organisms accounted for about 4% of the pure cultures. Virtually all of the pure and mixed streptococcal cultures were sensitive or moderately susceptible to ampicillin, cephalothin, and penicillin; however, approximately 50% of the streptococal and staphylocococcal isolates were resistant to demeclocycline hydrochloride and erythromycin.
