Resistance parameters of 17 clinical strains of Staph, aureus to oxacillin were studied with the methods of agar diffusion and serial dilutions in liquid and solid media. Statistically reliable correlation between the parameter values of resistance and growth inhibition zone diameters on diffusion into agar of 100 gamma of oxacillin was found. The latter method provided classification of the strains into groups with high, intermediate and low resistance levels. However, calculation of the resistance parameters according to the corresponding correlation equation was not enough correct for providing distinction in the resistance levels within the groups.
