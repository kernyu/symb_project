A highly penicillin-resistant strain of Bacteroides fragilis, strain GN11499, was found among 80 clinical isolates of the B.fragilis group and appears to produce a new type of penicillinase. Penicillinase activity was detected in crude extracts and had a specific activity of 0.25 U/mg of protein. About 20% of the enzyme was released into the surrounding medium during growth. The enzyme hydrolyzed ampicillin and cloxacillin more rapidly than it did penicillin G, carbenicillin, and cephaloridine. Relative rates in a crude extract with penicillin G as 100 were ampicillin, 357; carbenicillin, 57; cloxacillin, 271; and cephaloridine, 71. Enzyme activity was inhibited by clavulanic acid, CP-45, 899, N-formimidoyl thienamycin, cefoxitin, moxalactam, and p-chloromercuribenzoate. The enzyme had a molecular weight of approximately 41,500 and an isoelectric point of 6.9. Penicillinase production and tetracycline resistance were transferred from B.fragilis GN11499 to two susceptible strains of B.fragilis and Bacteroides vulgatus by filter mating.
