R factor 1818 is shown to be eliminated from a thymineless strain of Escherichia coli J6-2 (R-1818) during thymine starvation. Readdition of thymine to the starved cultures produces a partial recovery in viable count but does not affect the proportion of R(-) cells. The R factor is not cured from exponential- or stationary-phase cultures which are starved of required amino acids as well as thymine, nor from cells which are deprived of thymine in the presence of chloramphenicol. However, in both of these cases, the extent of thymineless death is reduced. It is suggested that protein synthesis is a requirement for R-1818 elimination, and the possible nature of this protein is discussed.
