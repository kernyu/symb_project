On the basis of the presented results and those published by other investigators it can be stated that in the throat (i) bacterial interference is a multifaceted phenomenon; (ii) bacterial interference not only varies individually but also fluctuates in the individual by time and the epidemiological situation; (iii) bacterial interference among the microbes in the normal flora apparently helps the individual to combat the invading microorganisms; (iv) bacteriocins, if present, in the invading bacteria represent an important virulence factor; (v) bacterial interference as a factor of the host resistance to infection can be influenced negatively by antibiotic therapy; (vi) bacterial interference can act synergistically with antibiotics given in optimal doses saving the normal flora.
