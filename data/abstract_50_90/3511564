Approximately 20,000 strains of Salmonella were screened annually for resistance to tetracycline, chloramphenicol, kanamycin and ampicillin since 1959, and also to trimethoprim since 1978. Tetracycline-resistant strains increased in human subjects and pigs from 1961. After the ban on incorporation of tetracycline in animal feeds for nutritive purposes in 1974, the proportion of tetracycline-resistant strains in pigs and human subjects decreased. In veal calves, the number of strains of S. typhimurium and S. dublin resistant to multiple drugs increased from 1972. Strains resistant to multiple antibiotics in man were mainly isolated from adoptive children from Indonesia. No further spread of these strains was observed. So far, strains similar to those in calves resistant to multiple drugs were only incidentally isolated from human patients.
