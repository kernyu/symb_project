Lactobacillus plantarum is aerotolerant during log-phase growth on glucose, but is an obligate aerobe on polyols. Respiration was cyanide resistant and under certain conditions was associated with the accumulation of millimolar concentrations of H(2)O(2). On glucose, optimal growth was observed in the absence of O(2). Extracts of L. plantarum did not catalyze the reduction of paraquat by reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, but plumbagin (5-hydroxy-2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone) was readily reduced. Such extracts produced O(2) (-) in the presence of NADH plus plumbagin. Plumbagin caused a 10-fold increase in the rate of respiration of intact cells in the presence of glucose and also imposed a loss of viability which was dependent upon both glucose and O(2). Although extracts of L. plantarum were devoid of true superoxide dismutase activity, this organism was comparable to superoxide dismutase-containing species in its resistance toward hyperbaric O(2) and toward the oxygen-dependent lethality of plumbagin. L. plantarum required Mn-rich media and actively accumulated Mn(II). Soluble extracts were found to contain approximately 9 mug of Mn per mg of protein and 75 to 90% of this Mn was dialyzable. Such extracts exhibited a dialyzable and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid-inhibitable ability to scavenge O(2) (-). This O(2) (-)-scavenging activity was due to the dialyzable Mn(II) present in these extracts and could be mimicked by MnCl(2). Cells grown in Mn-rich media were enriched in dialyzable Mn and were more resistant toward oxygen toxicity and toward the oxygen-dependent plumbagin toxicity than were cells grown in Mn-deficient media. L. plantarum exhibited no nutritional requirement for iron and little or no iron was present in these cells, even when they were grown in iron-rich media. L. plantarum thus appears to use millimolar levels of Mn(II) to scavenge O(2) (-), much as most other organisms use micromolar levels of superoxide dismutases.
