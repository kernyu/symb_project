Interferon-treated L cells did not transfer priming to chick embryo fibroblasts (CEF) during cocultivation. Nor could transfer be observed when CEF were treated with homologous interferon in the mixed cultures. The results indicate that the lack of transfer by cocultivation is another characteristic of priming different from antiviral resistance.
