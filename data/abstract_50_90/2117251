A heat-resistant factor in ethanol extracts of the fungus Craterellus cornucopioides completely inhibited the mutagenicity of aflatoxin B1, benzo[a]pyrene, the acridine half mustard ICR-191 and 2-nitrofluorene in a forward-mutation system using Salmonella typhimurium TM677 (screening for 8-azaguanine resistance). There was no inhibitory effect on the mutagenic activity of 4-nitroquinoline-N-oxide, methyl methanesulfonate or N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine. Experiments performed to elucidate the mechanism of the antimutagenic effect showed that neither an alteration of cell viability nor an interference with the excision-repair and the inducible SOS-repair system was involved. The conceivable mechanisms for the antimutagenicity of the ethanol extract include direct chemical interaction with the mutagen and/or inhibition of the activation process in the case of the promutagens. The antimutagenic activity of Craterellus cornucopioides is not unique among mushroom species. The ethanol extracts of 6 other mushrooms showed a similar antimutagenic activity.
