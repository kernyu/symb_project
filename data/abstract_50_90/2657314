According to the existence of Plasmodium falciparum chloroquine-resisting cases in Madagascar and, someone, in the Comoro Archipelago, a study using in vivo W.H.O. test was conducted in Mayotte Island. Between the end of 1985 and 1987, despite the great difficulties for ambulatory blood collection in a rural population, 24% of malaria cases had been followed up during 28 days, using a dose of 25 mg/Kg in 3 days. During 1986 and 1987, 5 cases showed positive serology of thin blood films. Either the possibility of reinfection cannot be excluded, these cases may be notified as R I and R II resistant type according to the W.H.O. standard test. In vitro W.H.O. test is necessary to confirm this fact but is not possible in local laboratory conditions. Thus, the surveillance of chemosensitivity of Plasmodium falciparum local strains is a priority. Nevertheless, chloroquine remains efficient for prophylactic (new travelers only) or curative purpose in the main cases.
