The location of T4D phage-induced dihydrofolate reductase (dfr) has been determined in intact and incomplete phage particles. It has been found that phage mutants inducing a temperature-sensitive dfr (dfrts) procude heat-labile phage particles. The structural dfr produced by these ts mutants was shown to assume different configurations depending on the temperature at which the phage is assembled. Morphogenesis of incomplete phage particles lacking the gene 11 protein on their baseplates was found to be inhibited by reagents binding to dfr, such as antibodies to dfr. Further, cofactor molecules for dfr, such as reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate and reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, also inhibited the step in morphogenesis involving the addition of gene 11 product. On the other hand, inhibitors of dfr, such as adenosine dephosphoribose, stimulated the addition of the gene 11 protein. It has been concluded that the phage-induced dfr is a baseplate component which is partially covered by the gene 11 protein. The properties of phage particles produced after infection of the nonpermissive host with the one known T4D mutant containing a nonsense mutation in its dfr gene suggested that these progeny particles contained a partial polypeptide, which was large enough to serve as a structural element.
