The clinical study of CZX-S in the field of pediatrics was performed and the following results were obtained. The overall effect of CZX-S was "markedly improved" in 2 and "moderately improved" in 4 of the 6 patients with bacterial infection. Bacteriological findings show that causative organisms were eradicated in all the 5 patients observed. The breakdown of the organisms was S. aureus, S. pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae and E. coli. The serum concentration of CZX was 3.3 approximately 15.4 micrograms/ml (mean +/- S.E. 8.9 +/- 2.0 micrograms/ml) at 15-37 minutes after initial rectal administration with CZX-S 125 (dose: 7.7-11.9 mg/kg). While, in the CZX-S 250 administratered group, the serum concentration was 3.1 micrograms/ml and 10.5 micrograms/ml at 20 minutes after initial rectal administration (dose: 5.6 mg/kg and 14.7 mg/kg). The urinary recovery rate up to 6 hours after initial rectal administration was 68.6% in 1 patient given CZX-S 125 and 28.3-52.5% (mean +/- S.E. 38.7 +/- 7.2%) in 3 patients given CZX-S 250. Side effects and abnormalities in laboratory test values were not observed in any cases.
