Bacteriophage PBS2 replication is unaffected by rifampicin and other rifamycin derivatives, which are potent inhibitors of Bacillus subtilis RNA synthesis. Extracts of gently-lysed infected cells contain a DNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity which is specific for uracil-containing PBS2 DNA. The PBS2-induced RNA polymerase is insensitive to rifamycin derivatives which inhibit the host's RNA polymerase.
