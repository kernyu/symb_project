The method of multifactor dispersion analysis was used to reveal that the synchronizing effect resulting from the action of the complex of climatic and geophysical environmental factors (day length, barometric pressure, magnetic field perturbations) on the non-specific mechanisms of protection from infections during the year exceeded the results obtained by the mere summation of the influences contributed by each factor. Therefore, the seasonal fluctuations in the functions of the nonspecific resistance of the body against infection were due to the synchronizing action of the complex of geophysical factors changing with the seasons.
