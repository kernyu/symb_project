Rhizobium trifolii strains IARI and Rel-1 produced substances with broad and narrow activity spectra, respectively. Reproducible inhibitory zones of various sizes produced by R. trifolii IARI (2 to 14 mm) and R. trifolii Rel-1 (2 to 6 mm) were detected, depending upon the indicator organism used. The maximum production of these substances by both strains of R. trifolii was observed on l-arabinose agar. A preliminary characterization of the antimicrobial substance produced by strain IARI showed resistance to heat (75 to 80 degrees C for 45 min), trypsin, lysozyme, DNase I, and RNase A. On the other hand, the substance produced by strain Rel-1 showed sensitivity to heat (75 to 80 degrees C for 45 min) and trypsin, but resistance to lysozyme, RNase A, and DNase I.
