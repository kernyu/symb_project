Malaria should be considered in a patient with unexplained fever and a history of travel to an endemic area. Aggressive therapy must be started if Plasmodium falciparum infection is a possibility. Travelers must be educated about mosquito bite protection and appropriate chemoprophylaxis. Travelers can, however, acquire malaria despite chemoprophylaxis, and symptoms may appear up to one year after the trip.
