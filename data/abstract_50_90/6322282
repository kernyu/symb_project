HSV-2-ACG, a mutant of herpes simplex virus type 2, which is resistant to acycloguanosine and also capable of inducing fusion of BSC1 cells, was isolated. The viral-induced surface changes in these cells were studied using scanning electron microscopy. The formation of gigantic fused cells with increased number of microvilli and virus-like particles, extensively covering the infected cell surface, were investigated. Tunicamycin (50 micrograms/ml), an inhibitor of glycosylation of polypeptides, blocks the production of infectious virus, as well as the cell-fusion and efficiently prevents the viral induced alterations occurring on the surface of the cells.
