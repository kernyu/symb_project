Netilmicin was compared with gentamicin and streptomycin for in-vitro activity against 30 strains of penicillin-tolerant streptococci including 16 strains of enterococci. Both netilmicin and gentamicin tested alone at 4 mg/l caused 99.9% kill of more than half of the 13 strains of viridans streptococci tested, whereas streptomycin, 4 mg/l, had no bactericidal effect against these strains. Netilmicin, gentamicin and streptomycin tested alone at 8.0 mg/l against 10 strains of Streptococcus faecalis resulted in 99.9% kill of six, one and zero strains respectively. Combinations of penicillin with 2 mg/l of either netilmicin or gentamicin resulted in bactericidal synergy against 12 of 13 strains of viridans streptococci and all 10 strains of S. faecalis after 18 to 24 h incubation. Parallel experiments showed that higher concentration of penicillin were required to obtain 99.9% kill of 10 streptococcal strains when 4 mg/l streptomycin was compared with 2 mg/l of the other aminoglycosides. Killing curves showed similar bactericidal synergy for netilmicin-penicillin and gentamicin-penicillin combinations against most streptococci tested after 24 h incubation but there was sometimes a greater bactericidal effect noted with netilmicin after only 6 h incubation of the broth or after 48 h incubation. The results of this in-vitro study suggest that netilmicin is at least as effective as gentamicin as a bactericidal synergic agent with penicillin against penicillin-tolerant viridans streptococci and S. faecalis strains isolated from patients with endocarditis. Neither gentamicin or netilmicin were effective as bactericidal synergic agents with penicillin against 4 of 6 strains of S. faecium tested.
