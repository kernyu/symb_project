IncFII plasmids consisting of a basic replicon and of an additional fragment(s) unrelated to plasmid maintenance were all less stable in polA1 than in its wild type. Reversion to UV-resistance recovered stability and vice versa. UV irradiation promoted instability in polA1 cells. Larger plasmids showed a greater instability and a fewer number of copies in a same host. Surprisingly, polA1 cells with Tn3 on the plasmid showed a higher ampicillin resistance than the wild type, apparently suggesting that the polA1 mutation increases the copy number. The size-dependency of instability was less marked in polA1 than in its parent. Comparison of the generation times has suggested a detrimental effect exerted by a basic replicon in polA1 hosts.
