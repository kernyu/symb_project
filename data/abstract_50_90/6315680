The regulatory region controlling the expression of tetracycline resistance and repressor genes contains two nearly identical regions of dyad symmetry. Deletions of this control region were isolated by digestion with S1 nuclease. The ability of these deletions to bind the tet repressor was determined by an in vivo repressor titration assay. The results indicate that repressor specifically binds both regions of dyad symmetry.
