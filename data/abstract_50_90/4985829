Streptomycin-dependent cholera vibrio strains were derived from Inaba, Ogawa, and NAG vibrios by the method of Mel. These phenotypes grew more slowly and attacked fermentable substances after a longer period of time than the streptomycin-sensitive parent strains. Rabbits injected with streptomycin-sensitive strains and their streptomycin-dependent forms showed homologous agglutinin production. Patas monkeys fed with 10(9) streptomycin-dependent strains shed them for 1 to 2 days without ill effect, whereas the same number of streptomycin-independent organisms caused disease. The possibility of the application of multiple doses of streptomycin-dependent organisms in oral immunization against cholera was considered.
