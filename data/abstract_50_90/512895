Reproducible growth rates of Pseudomonas cepacia were obtained. P. cepacia had a markedly different resistance pattern to single and combined antibacterials from that characteristic of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Benzalkonium and chlorhexidine were more active against log phase P. cepacia than against log phase P. aeruginosa, but polymyxin B sulfate was inactive against log phase P. cepacia at all concentrations tested (smaller than or equal to 16 units/ml). Antagonism of antibacterial activity between edetate disodium-benzalkonium and edetate disodium-chlorhexidine combinations was marked with 16-hr P. cepacia and with 16-hr Staphylococcus aureus. Phenylethanol-benzalkonium and phenylethanolchlorhexidine combinations had no more than additive activity against log phase P. cepacia. These results have relevance to hospital disinfection and preservation of pharmaceutical solutions.
