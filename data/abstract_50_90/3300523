The combined effect of various polyenic antibiotics and other antifungal and antibacterial drugs on Candida was studied. The efficacy of the combinations was estimated with the method of square titration followed by quantitative plating out of the samples. By the interaction type the combinations were divided into 3 groups. The character of the drug interaction in these groups might be considered as indifferent, additive or synergistic. No antagonistic effect was observed in any of the combinations. The findings may be useful in more successful treatment of candidiasis when monotherapy is not sufficiently efficient, as well as in optimization of schemes for treating mixed infections.
