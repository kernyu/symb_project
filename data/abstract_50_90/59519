Specific delayed-type hypersensitivity was induced in guinea pigs with bovine albumin + complete Freund adjuvant, bovine gamma globulin + complete Freund adjuvant and BCG vaccine. The animals were subsequently tested for nonspecific antimicrobial resistance. Sensitized and control groups were challenged intraperitoneally with Listeria monocytogenes 2 hr after reinjection with the sensitizing antigen. The listeria content of the spleens was determined 1 or 5 days after the infection. The number of organisms recovered from the spleen one day after infection was significantly less in guinea pigs sensitized with bovine gamma globulin and BCG than in the control group; after 5 days no such difference was recorded. There was no difference between the bovine albumin sensitized and the control group 1 day after infection, while on the 5th postinfection day listeria counts were higher in the sensitized than in the control animals.
