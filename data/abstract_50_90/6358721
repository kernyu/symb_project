In summary, Table XVI shows the inhibition profiles of representative beta-lactamases from each major class of Richmond and Sykes. Either resistance (R) or sensitivity (S) is given as a general guide to the type of compounds likely to inhibit each class. Thus the (qualitative) statements regarding the effectiveness of clavulanic acid can be taken to represent those for the penam sulfones and similarly for MM4550 and the other olivanic acids, carpetimycins, PS series, and asparenomycins. This can also be said of cloxacillin and the other aromatic carboxamido penicillins. Compounds are also included which are specifically or particularly inhibitory to certain beta-lactamases.
