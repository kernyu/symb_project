Perhydroderivatives of polyene antibiotics have a much lower activity against eukaryotic cells than the polyene antibiotics itself. Bacterial cells are normally resistant against most polyene antibiotics and their perhydroderivatives. In earlier experiments with wall less L-form cells of Escherichia coli we have shown that the bacterial cell wall may be responsible for the resistance of the intact bacterial cells against polyene antibiotics and their perhydroderivatives by masking internal target sites. In the present paper we studied the effect of polyene antibiotics and their perhydroderivatives on intact cells and protoplasts of Candida guilliermondii. Our experiments have shown that most of the perhydroderivatives studied had a lower activity against intact cells as well as protoplasts than the corresponding polyene antibiotics. This means that in the case of eukaryotic cells the cell wall as a penetration barrier cannot mainly be responsible for the low activity of perhydroderivatives. The results are compared with those obtained previously with intact cells and protoplast type L-form cells of E. coli.
