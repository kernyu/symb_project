The antibacterial activities of cefotaxime (CTX), cefoperazone (CPZ), ceftizoxime (CZX), cefmenoxime (CMX), latamoxef (LMOX), cefotiam (CTM), cefazolin (CEZ), gentamicin (GM) and cefsulodin (CFS) were investigated. All causative organisms were isolated from patients with urinary tract infections treated in Tokai University Hospital. The results were as follows. 1) The MICs of CMX, CTX, and CZX against most of clinically isolated strains of E. coli, K. pneumoniae, Indole (-) Proteus sp. were 0.1 microgram/ml and lower. And then CTM, LMOX and CPZ showed similar antibacterial activities. 2) LMOX and GM showed potent antibacterial activities against C. freundii which was considered to be causative organisms of infections in rare cases. 3) Against S. marcescens, CMX, CTX, CZX, and LMOX showed very potent antibacterial activities. 4) Against P. aeruginosa, CFS, GM and CPZ showed moderate antibacterial activities. 5) Against Enterobacter sp., GM and CMX showed potent antibacterial activities.
