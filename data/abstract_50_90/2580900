The quinoline-3-carboxamide LS 2616 administered to mice in drinking water increased spontaneous cytotoxicity against YAC-1 cells in a dose-dependent manner. The enhancement of spontaneous cytotoxicity was found to be mediated by NK cells, as judged by their lack of adherence to nylon wool columns, relative resistance to treatment with antibodies to Thy-1.2 and complement, and almost total abrogation after depletion of asialo-GM1+ cells. Enhancement of NK activity was evident after 2 days of treatment, was maximal after 4 days, and remained elevated during the 14-day exposure period studied. NK activity returned to control levels 4 days after cessation of treatment. NK activity was significantly increased in spleen, peripheral blood, lymph nodes, and bone marrow of LS 2616-treated mice, while activity in peritoneal exudate cells and thymus remained low. LS 2616 was able to elevate NK activity in several mouse strains studied, including mice homozygous for the beige gene. Serum interferon levels were not increased during treatment with LS 2616. Combined injection of the interferon inducer Poly I:C and LS 2616 did not increase NK activity above that of animals injected with Poly I:C alone. However, Poly I:C, in contrast to LS 2616, increased NK activity in peritoneal exudate cells. Studies at the single cell level revealed that LS 2616 increased NK activity by increasing the number of lytically active cells via recruitment of new target-binding cells and not by increasing the lytic activity of pre-existing binders.
