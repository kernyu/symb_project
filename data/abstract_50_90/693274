A bacteriological investigation of 199 urinary specimens from dogs with symptoms of urinary tract infections is presented. No bacterial growth was detected in 55.7% of all specimens examined. Isolation rates from urine specimens from noncatheterized and catheterized dogs were 35.2 and 66.7%, respectively, thus emphazising the importance of the sampling method and also that urinary tract infections in dogs can not be diagnozed solely on the basis of clinical symptoms. Bacteria belonging to the Enterobacteriaceae were most common isolated. Ampicillin was the drug to which resistance was least common (16.2%) while 79.1% of the strains examined were resistant to sulphonamide.
