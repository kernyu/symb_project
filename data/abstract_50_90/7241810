Serotypes and antibiotic susceptibility of Streptococcus pneumoniae from various clinical specimens from Jan. 1979 to July 1980 were examined. (1) The serotype of the organism widely distributed, and predominant serotypes were type 6, type 15, type 19, type 3 and type 23. Strains of type 2, 12 and 25, which were used as pneumococcal vaccine, were not found. (2) From the results of susceptibility test the most active drug was PCG among penicillins and CER among cephalosporins. There was one strain which was resistant to PCG and CER as well as CP and TC. Sixty-five% and 48% of the strains were resistant to TC and CP respectively. Almost of the strains were sensitive to macrolides and LCM. The occurrence of resistant strains to CP, TC, EM and LCM varied to the serotypes.
