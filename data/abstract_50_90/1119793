The effect of repeated cycles of tetracycline and oleandomycin administration on the complement titer, content of lysozyme and bactericidal properties of the serum in rabbits with experimental staphylococcal sepsis was studied. It was shown that the septic process induced by intravenous inoculation of staphylococci was accompanied by stimulation of the host nonspecific resistance. However, repeated inoculations of the animals resulted in exhaustion of the host protective forces and decreased non-specific resistance. The use of tetracycline in experimental staphylococcal sepsis was accompanied by an increase in the complement titer, lysozyme content and bactericidal properties of the serum after both the 1st and 2nd cycles of the drug administration. The use of oleaudomycin induced an increase in the contents of the complement, lysozyme and bactericidal properties of the serum at the background of staphylococcal sepsis only after the 1st cycle. The repeated cycle of oleandomycin administration was accompanied by a decrease in the above indices. Such conditions should be taken into account in choosing the antibiotic for treatment of septic cases especially when repeated cycles of the drug administration are used.
