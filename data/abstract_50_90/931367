In the absence of selective pressure by antibiotics, resistant enterobacteria implanted rapidly in the intestinal tract of chickens, where these organisms subsequently persisted in high numbers. Food could be an important source of this contamination: resistant Escherichia coli present in small numbers in the diet became rapidly and persistently established in the gut. The human caretaker played a passive role in the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria between separate groups of chickens. Resistant enteric organisms colonized the gut of animals, with different population sizes. Some strains were able to reach high numbers (10(7) to 10(9)/g), and other strains established themselves at a lower level (10(3) to 10(5)/g), whereas a third type seemed to be only transient inhabitants, unable to persist.
