In the new agent 3-(5-tetrazolyl)penam, hereafter referred to as CP-35,587, the carboxyl function at C3 in the penicillin nucleus has been replaced with the 5-tetrazolyl moiety. Marked changes in spectrum and resistance to gram-negative beta-lactamases, particularly with regard to Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates, were conferred by this modification. The anti-Klebsiella activity clearly distinguishes the antibacterial spectrum of CP-35,587 from any known broad-spectrum penicillin. Compared to orally active cephalosporins, the spectrum advantage of CP-35,587 encompasses Enterobacter, Serratia marcescens, Citrobacter, Providencia, Haemophilus influenzae, and Streptococcus faecalis, both in vitro and in murine infections produced by many of the above-named microorganisms. Thus, CP-35,587 combines and extends the antibacterial activity of broad-spectrum penicillins and orally active cephalosporins.
