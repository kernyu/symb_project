The killing of Staphylococcus aureus strain 1030 and derived variants of it by lysozyme increased with increased lysozyme concentrations or decreased concentrations of sodium chloride. beta-Lactamase-producing and non-producing derivatives of strain 1030 were constructed. The former were less susceptible to lysozyme. Induction of beta-lactamase synthesis with 2-2'carboxyphenyl-benzoyl-6-penicillanic acid increased the resistance of producer strains to lysozyme. These results are discussed in relation to the spread of beta-lactamase-producing strains of S. aureus.
