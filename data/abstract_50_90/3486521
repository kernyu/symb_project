Isolates of Staphylococcus aureus (106) from bovine mastitis were tested for susceptibility to antimicrobial agents. beta-lactamase was produced by 69.8 per cent of isolates and 7.5 per cent were resistant to streptomycin (minimum inhibitory concentration more than 32 micrograms/ml). Resistance to other agents was rare. Intrinsic resistance or tolerance to beta-lactam antibiotics was not found.
