The in vitro activity of carbenicillin, ticarcillin, sisomicin and netilmicin alone and in combination against 35 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was investigated. Ticarcillin was more active than carbenicillin and sisomicin was more active than netilmicin. There was enhanced killing of many strains of P. aeruginosa by the combination of carbenicillin or ticarcillin with sisomicin or netilmicin.
