The role of the energy status of the yeast cell in the sensitivity of cultures to two yeast toxins was examined by using 12K release from cells as a measure of toxin action. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae killer toxin bound to sensitive cells in the presence of drugs that interfered with the generation or use of energy, but it was unable to efflux 12K from the cells under these conditions. In direct contrast, the Torulopsis glabrata pool efflux-stimulating toxin induced efflux of the yeast 42K pool was insensitive to the presence of energy poisons in cultures. The results indicate that an energized state, maintained at the expense of adenosine 5'-triphosphate from either glycolytic or mitochondrial reactions, is required for the action of the killer toxin on the yeast cell.
