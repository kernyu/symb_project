Mupirocin (2 percent) ointment is a unique topical agent recently developed for use in the treatment of superficial skin infections. It has shown excellent in vitro and in vivo activity against gram-positive staphylococci and streptococci, which are the predominant pathogens in most superficial skin infections, and against gram-negative Hemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. At present, mupirocin (2 percent) ointment has been approved for use in the treatment of impetigo, but an analysis of several recent clinical trials has also indicated the potential for mupirocin treatment of other primary and secondary skin infections. Furthermore, because mupirocin apparently has fewer adverse effects than systemic antibiotics, is less expensive, easier to administer, and less likely to induce antibiotic resistance, it should be considered as an alternative to oral agents in the antimicrobial therapy of a variety of primary and secondary skin disorders.
