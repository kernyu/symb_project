The tube dilution method of performing antibiotic sensitivity tests is commonly employed as an accurate method for defining the minimal inhibitory concentration in relation to pathogenic organisms. It is also used as a reference for comparing minimal inhibitory concentrations with the size of the zone of inhibition in the agar diffusion test. Although surveys have shown that there is no standardized method and technique of performing the tube dilution test, it is generally assumed that all of the diversified methods will yield the same results and interpretations. With the assistance of five experts, seven different tube dilution methods were compared; 16 antibiotics, and three organisms for each antibiotic, were used. The conclusions drawn are that, although the accuracy of a single method within its own confines is acknowledged, the minimal inhibitory concentrations and interpretations cannot be interpolated from one laboratory to another where a different technique is employed. The results are frequently discrepant. It is suggested that a uniform method be developed and promulgated for general use.
