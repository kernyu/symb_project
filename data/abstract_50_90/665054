S. epidermidis D-5/48, D-5/240, and S. aureus 209 P caused a local infectious process with an analogous course in intrascrotal infection of male albino mice; this process was characterized by the changes of the relative weight coefficient of the affected tissues, positive staphylococcus culture, and exudative inflammation. This confirmed the role of epidermal coagulase-negative staphylococci in the infectious pathology. Benzylpenicillin treatment of local staphylococcus infection proved to be ineffective, although the staphylococcus strains used for the infection were sensitive to this antibiotic. This treatment led to the selection of the antibiotic-resistant forms of the microorganisms and to the aggravation of the infectious process, suggesting greater virulence of the antibiotic-resistant strains. The minimal suppressive acridines concentrations prevented the development of penicillin resistance and selection of resistant staphylococci, increased the therapeutic efficacy of this antibiotic.
