Males with acute gonococcal urethritis were treated at random with 2.4 million units aqueous procaine penicillin G intramuscularly plus 1.0 g. probenecid orally, 3.5 g. ampicillin orally plus 1.0 g. probenecid orally, or 2.0 g. spectinomycin intramuscularly. The overall follow-up was 97%. All treatments were of equal efficacy, eradication of gonococcal disease being observed in 93 to 97% of treated patients. Treatment failures occurred in each drug group and pre-treatment isolates recovered from these cases showed decreased susceptibility to the agent used. Aqueous procaine penicillin G plus probenecid remains the preferred therapy for gonorrhea. For patients hypersensitive to penicillin, spectinomycin is currently a reasonable alternative drug. This agent, unlike procaine penicillin-probenecid, is probably ineffective against concurrent incubating syphilis, and future development of bacterial resistance is a definite possibility.
