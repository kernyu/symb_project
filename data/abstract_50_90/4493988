Surveillance of infections at the Ottawa General Hospital between September 1, 1971 and August 31, 1972 showed that the overall infection rate was 13.5% of which 5.6% was community-acquired while 7.9% was of nosocomial origin. These figures are comparable to those for equivalent hospitals in the United States and lower than those reported from the Boston City Hospital, but they nevertheless indicate that over half the infected patients in the hospital were infected after admission. Urinary tract infections accounted for 44.8% of all nosocomial infections and clearly dominated the picture. The postoperative wound infection rate was 3.9% and accounted for only 18% of nosocomial infections. It is probable that these findings are representative of general hospitals throughout Canada and indicate conditions which will not long be tolerated. The knowledge and techniques exist for the prevention of all hospital cross-infection and much autogenous infection. Specific measures are suggested for working towards this goal. These are (1) the replacement of archaic hospitals and hospital facilities, (2) the establishment in every hospital of an efficient surveillance program, (3) the institution of good catheterization and catheter care techniques, and (4) the establishment by hospitals of a quality control program whereby a specific explanation is required for every infection occurring within the hospital.
