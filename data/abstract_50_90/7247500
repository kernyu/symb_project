Enzymatic patterns, antibiotic sensitivity, penicillinase, production, mercury ion resistance have been studied in St. saprophyticus strains in comparison with St. epidermidis, both isolate from urinary infections of hospital patients. The St. saprophyticus has shown to have a lower number of virulence factors, to be more sensitive to antibiotics and to have a lower potential epidemiological value.
