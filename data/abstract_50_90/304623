A study was made of the effect of maintenance of m. sartorius of the grass frog in several concentrations of chloral hydrate (0.0025 M, 0.005 M, 0.008 M, 0.01 M, and 0.02 M) on their resistance to 0.08 M concentration of this substance. The increase in resistance of muscles was observed after the maintenance in all the several concentrations of the agent except one (0.02 M). The increase in resistance was maximal after a 5 minute maintenance in any concentration. The optimal dose of the effect was a 5 minute maintenance in 0.005 M chloral hydrate solution. In this case the increase in resistance to 0.08 chloral hydrate was the highest (about 23%). The study of the effect of optimal doses on the resistance of muscle tissue to 0.12 M solution fluoride, 3.48 M ethyl alcohol and to 36 derees showed a statistically significant increase in resistance from 22.7 to 39.4%.
