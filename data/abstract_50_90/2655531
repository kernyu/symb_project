Time-kill studies were performed to determine the effect of tetracycline resistance (tet) gene expression on gentamicin killing of Escherichia coli. Expression of tet increased gentamicin killing in laboratory strains and clinical isolates. A role for tetracycline in inducing tet expression and increasing the bactericidal activity of aminoglycosides is suggested.
