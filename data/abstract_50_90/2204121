The sensitivity to chloroquine of Plasmodium falciparum from the Kavango region of Namibia was determined by a 24-hour test in vitro. Twenty-six isolates were successfully tested, of which 11 were resistant to a low degree, schizogony being inhibited at 8 pmol/well. The results of the Dill-Glazko test for the presence of 4-aminoquinolines in urine indicate that chloroquine is not widely used in the area.
