Twenty-six episodes of Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteremia treated with intravenous ceftazidime, 4-6 g/day were evaluated. Treatment was begun within the first 24 hours after the isolation of the microorganism and was maintained for 10-12 days. In two patients with neutropenia amikacin was added during the initial 48-72 hours until the susceptibility to ceftazidime was known. All isolates were sensitive to ceftazidime. The most common underlying diseases were neoplasia (12), diabetes with stroke (4), neurosurgical and vascular procedures (4), rheumatoid arthritis (2), burns (2), cor pulmonale (1), and hypertension (1). The origins of bacteremia were urinary (12), pulmonary (9), and unknown (5). The infection was hospital-acquired in 77% and community-acquired in 23%. A critical clinical status and the presence of complications were significantly (p less than 0.01) associated with an increased mortality rate. Clinical outcome was good in 18/26 (70%), with a 30% mortality rate. The microbiological evolution showed 14 eradications, 6 persistences, 3 relapses and 3 colonizations. Resistance did not develop during therapy. Ceftazidime may be a good alternative therapy for these severe infections, although wider comparative studies are required for a better evaluation.
