Antibiotic testing by Disc was compared with Break-Point method using 535 clinical isolates; Disc sensitivity method was carried out in the routine way using the disc provided by pharmaceutical company. Break-point sensitivity was done by incorporating the substrate into solid medium, the results obtained showed greater resistance by Break-point which appears to be more realistic in the light of indiscriminate usage of antibiotic. The method is simple, cost effective, reliable and realistic (JPMA 39 : 94, 1989).
