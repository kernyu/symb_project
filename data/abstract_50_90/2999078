A single copy of the Streptococcus faecalis transposon Tn917, located in the Bacillus subtilis chromosome, was able to transpose onto the SPO2 cos plasmid pPL1017, which codes for chloramphenicol resistance and contains the bacteriophage phi 105 immunity region. Selection for pPL1017::Tn917 chimeras was performed by SPO2-mediated plasmid transduction of transposon-borne resistance to macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B antibiotics (MLSr). The transposition of Tn917 onto plasmid pPL1017 occurred with a frequency of 10(-5) and was dependent on the presence of a subinhibitory dose of erythromycin. Twelve chimeras were subjected to genetic and physical analyses. Two Cams transductants harbored plasmids whose chloramphenicol acetyltransferase genes had been insertionally inactivated by Tn917. Several transpositions in the vicinity of the phi 105 immunity region were detected. However, all of the 300 MLSr, Camr transductants screened were immune to phi 105 infectious activity. One pPL1017::Tn917 chimera, pLK200, was transferred by SPO2 plasmid transduction into the Bacillus amyloliquefaciens prototrophic strain DSM7. Plasmid pLK200 was effective in the mutagenesis of the DSM7 chromosome and yielded auxotrophs at a frequency of 0.5 to 5.3%. Generation of auxotrophs was also dependent on the presence of a subinhibitory dose of erythromycin. Forty-four auxotrophs representing at least nine amino acid requirements were recovered.
