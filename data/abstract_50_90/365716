14 lots of 6 different commercial media for susceptibility testing were compared by agar diffusion test with 161 bacterial strains. The result "resistant" to sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, or co-trimoxazole varied in wide limits between the media. The lot employed by the "Work-Group on Resistance" of the Paul Ehrlich Society is of limited value for testing of the investigated drugs.
