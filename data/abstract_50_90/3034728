A fifth tetracycline(Tc)-resistance determinant, designated class E, has been identified on a transferable plasmid found in a fecal strain of Escherichia coli. This determinant does not show homology by DNA-DNA hybridization at high stringency with any of four other Tc resistance determinants (classes A, B, C and D) previously described among the Enterobacteriaceae. Resistance is inducible by 1 microgram Tc/ml and increases the minimum inhibitory concentration 130-fold for Tc and 3.5-fold for minocycline. The mechanism, like that of the other four determinants examined, appears to involve an active efflux of the drug. Using a 32P-labeled cloned fragment containing the resistance determinant, we have found the determinant in Aeromonas, but not in any of over 200 other E. coli strains tested.
