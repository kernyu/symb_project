Gnotobiological studies showed that under natural conditions normal microflora (microsymbiocenosis) is necessary for normal vital activity. In addition to autochthonous flora microsymbiocenosis includes an insignificant number of facultative pathogenic bacteria. In etiotropic antibiotic therapy it is important to preserve the autochthonous portion of the microsymbiocenonosis: bifidobacteria, lactobacilli, propionic bacteria and others. However, with respect to certain indications (diseases associated with suppression of resistance to infections) total decontamination with obligatory isolation of the patient under gnotobiological conditions is possible. In selective decontamination the facultative pathogenic portion of the intestinal microflora is the sole target of antibiotics. Selective decontamination is one of the methods for control of nosocomial infections, dysbacteriosis. It is indicated that establishment of departments in charge of investigation of intestinal microflora of patients and medical staff in hospitals is required for detecting risk groups which can be both the source of infection and the population most susceptible to hospital strains of antibiotic resistant facultative pathogenic bacteria.
