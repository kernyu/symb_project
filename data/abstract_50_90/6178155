The oligonucleotide (2'-5') oligoadenylate that is induced in interferon-treated animal cells protects plant tissue from infection by the tobacco mosaic virus. This inhibition of virus multiplication was obtained at concentrations comparable to those affecting protein synthesis and antiviral activities in animal cells. After treatment with (2'-5') oligoadenylate, the multiplicability of tobacco mosaic virus was reduced by 80 to 90 percent as measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. These results, along with the observation that human interferon protects tobacco tissue from infection by tobacco mosaic virus, indicate that plants and animals may have a common pathway for virus resistance.
