The antibiotic susceptibility of 2297 strains of Staphylococci aureus isolated from mastitic milk has been tested. The percentage of strains of S. aureus "resistant" to penicillin was 16.5%. Approximately 97% of these strains were susceptible both to tetracyclines and sulfonamides. The frequency of "resistant" strains is in good agreement with the results from a comparable survey done ten years ago. In this investigation, however, the strains of S. aureus showed great variation in their sensitivity to penicillin according to their geographical origin. Thus, the percentage "resistant" strains within counties varied from a minimum of 9.26 to a maximum of 53.05.
