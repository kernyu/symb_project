Forty-seven strains of Citrobacter diversus were isolated during a 12-month period from clinical material obtained from patients in a general hospital in Israel. The majority of cultures (38) were recovered from urine and wound discharges. There was one case of septicemia. The biochemical reactions of all cultures were typical for this species, except one that was anaerogenic, and they could be divided into five biotypes (a through e). Thirty-nine strains were identified serologically and found to belong to one of seven O groups described by Gross and Rowe (1974). All cultures were sensitive to tetracycline and nalidixic acid. All strains were resistant to carbenicillin and ampicillin and produced beta-lactamase.
