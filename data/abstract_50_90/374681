The ultrastructure of the wall of Candida albicans strain 6406 was examined in polyeneresistant organisms obtained by continued incubation after the cessation of growth. The walls of organisms harvested either during the exponential phase of growth or after 24 h starvation, when examined in situ, showed the typical layered appearance. After 72 h starvation, when the resistance to amphotericin B methyl ester (AME) was 60 times greater than that of exponentially growing organisms, both the periplasmic material and the distinct electron-dense layers were absent from the wall. At this stage there was no increase in the thickness of the wall. After 144 h starvation the thickness of the wall had increased from 143 +/-22 nm (exponential phase organisms) to 211+/-58 nm. If after 144 h starvation the organisms were incubated for 1 h in fresh nutrient medium they regained their sensitivity to AME and the wall regained the periplasmic material and its characteristic multilayered appearance. During the first 24 h starvation there was a considerable fall in the soluble glucan fraction, but on continued incubation there was little change in the relative proportions of the major carbohydrate constituents of the cell. Thin sections of purified walls isolated from organisms harvested either during exponential growth or after 144 h starvation were identical in appearance and characterized by the absence of the electrondense layers observed in sections of intact cells and by a reduction in thickness to 100+/-20nm.
