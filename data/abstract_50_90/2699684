Malaria is still the most important parasitic disease in the southeastern part of Iran. The in vivo and in vitro studies of the response of Plasmodium falciparum to chloroquine in Sistan-Baluchestan and Hormozgan provinces (1985-1987) have shown resistance in Iran-Shahr and Bandar Abbas areas. However the parasite was sensitive in Minab area. From 38 chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum (CRPF) cases, found in the studied malarious areas, 13 cases were in Afghan immigrants, 3 in Pakistani and 3 in Iranians who had travelled to Pakistan. Also from 14 CRPF imported cases studied in Teheran, since 1984, four patients were Afghans, 2 Bangalese, one Pakistani and 2 Iranians returned back from India. These findings indicate the great role of migration in introduction and establishment of CRPF in the malarious areas of the southeastern part of Iran. The responses of P. falciparum to mefloquine in the above malarious areas were in general satisfactory. However in few sporadic cases, innate tolerance was observed.
