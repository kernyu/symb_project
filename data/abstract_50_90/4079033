Intact gamma-globulin (SM-4300) was studied for its clinical efficacy in 13 of 23 cases of surgical severe bacterial infections. The drug was administered intravenously either 2.5 g/day for 3 days or 5 g for a day and the results were as follows. Clinical effects of SM-4300 in 13 cases of surgical severe bacterial infections were excellent in 1 case, good in 3, fair in 3 and poor in 6. SM-4300 was effective in all of 5 cases of intraperitoneal abscess. The elevation of serum IgG was observed after the administration of SM-4300 in all cases tested. As to complement, the slight elevation of serum CH50 was observed in the half of cases documented. Clinical side effects were not confirmed in any case. These results suggest that intact gamma-globulin (SM-4300) was effective in combination with antibiotics.
