Amphotericin B (2.5 mg/kg, administered intravenously) increased vascular resistance (renal more than pulmonary more than systemic) and decreased glomerular filtration and urine flow 94% in 16 anesthetized female mongrel dogs. Dopamine decreased renal vascular resistance 31% in 14 dogs; when amphotericin B was given with dopamine, there was partial antagonism of amphotericin B-induced renal vasoconstriction. Saralasin partially antagonized amphotericin B-induced renal vasoconstriction in seven dogs. When amphotericin B was given during combined infusion of dopamine and saralasin in eight dogs, renal blood flow remained at initial control levels, urine flow increased above initial levels, and glomerular filtration decreased only 21% from initial values. Amphotericin B increased renal vascular resistance 296% when given alone but only 41% in dogs during injection of both dopamine and saralasin (P = 0.002). The antagonism of amphotericin B-induced renal effects by the combination of dopamine and saralasin was significant and specific for the renal vascular bed.
