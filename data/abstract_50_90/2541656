An Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae strain contained a plasmid (pHD8.1) conferring resistance to streptomycin and sulfonamide. Restriction endonuclease mapping and DNA-DNA hybridization showed that pHD8.1 is related to RSF1010 from Salmonella panama, which also confers resistance to streptomycin and sulfonamide, and to pHD148 from Haemophilus ducreyi, which confers resistance only to sulfonamide.
