Shigella flexneri and Sh. shigae which are the two most common shigellae encountered in Vellore (south India) were found to exhibit resistance to trimethoprim and trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole. Eighty four per cent of this was high level resistance. Transfer studies conducted with these strains indicated that this high level resistance is plasmid mediated.
