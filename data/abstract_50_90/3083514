Isolates of Neisseria gonorrhoeae from patients attending the sexually transmitted disease clinics of the Cape Town Municipal Health Department were examined for beta-lactamase (penicillinase) production by a chromogenic cephalosporin test. Of the 208 isolates, 4 (less than 2%) produced beta-lactamase. When grown on chocolate blood agar plates 3 isolates showed no inhibition of growth around a penicillin disc; the 4th had a markedly reduced zone of inhibition. The minimum inhibitory concentrations of penicillin for these 4 strains were from 1 to 4 micrograms/ml.
