Acute spinal epidural abscess is an uncommon disease. Recommended management has been mainly surgical. We recently treated three cases within 4 weeks. Lowered immune resistance played a role in two of the cases. We suggest that acquired immunodeficiency syndrome will increase the incidence of this uncommon entity and advise that acute spinal epidural abscess can be successfully treated by nonsurgical means in some cases.
