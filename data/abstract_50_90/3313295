The authors examined 88 patients (32 Males and 56 Females) aged between 1 day and 13 years, suffering from urinary tract malformation, diagnosed during 1981-82 . The vesicoureteral reflux was the urinary tract malformation most frequently observed (56.81%). The patients showed symptoms of the illness within the first year of life in a percentage of 52%, while the 82% was symptomatic in 5 years. 30 months and 11 days was the average age at which the symptoms of the illness appeared, while the diagnosis was effected at an average of 47 months and 15 days. The authors pointed out the reasons of this diagnostic delay and the possibilities of filing it up. Urinary tract infection was found at the time of hospitalization in a percentage of 55%. The authors described the kind of germs isolated and their resistance to the most common antibiotics.
