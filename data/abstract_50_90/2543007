The staphylococcal transposon Tn4001 was introduced into Mycoplasma pulmonis using an Escherichia coli-derived vector by polyethylene glycol-mediated transformation. Using a reaction mixture containing 10 micrograms plasmid DNA, 10 micrograms yeast tRNA, and 34-35% polyethylene glycol per 1 x 10(8) cells, Tn4001 could be introduced into M. pulmonis at a frequency of 5 x 10(-5) per colony forming unit. DNA-DNA hybridization studies illustrated that Tn4001 could occupy a diversity of insertion sites in the M. pulmonis chromosome. These data indicated that Tn4001 is a potentially useful tool for the introduction of mutations and for genetic studies in M. pulmonis.
