One hundred fifty-two bacterial strains that possess resistance to kanamycin A, gentamicin, or tobramycin, or to more than one of these antibiotics, were collected from various sources in Canada, Europe, Japan, and the United States. This collection was composed of Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and members of the Enterobacteriaceae family. Their susceptibility to BB-K8 (amikacin), a new broad-spectrum semisynthetic derivative of kanamycin A, and to the other agents, was determined on Mueller-Hinton Medium by the twofold agar dilution method. Test results revealed that 60.5% of the isolates were resistant to 8 mug of tobramycin per ml, 67.1% to 8 mug of gentamicin per ml, 86.2% to 20 mug of kanamycin A per ml, and only 8.6% to 20 mug of amikacin per ml. Of interest is the fact that the amikacin-resistant strains were generally resistant to all of the other aminoglycosides. The broad spectrum of amikacin was not totally unexpected, because the compound has been shown to be a poor substrate for most enzymes that inactivate other aminoglycosides through O-phosphorylation, O-adenylylation, or N-acetylation. A number of susceptibility profiles were obtained when the organisms were tested against a series of nine aminoglycosides. The majority of these profiles resembled those found for organisms that possess known mechanisms of enzymatic inactivation.
