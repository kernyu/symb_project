Ofloxacin is one of a new generation of fluorinated quinolones structurally related to nalidixic acid. It is an orally administered broad spectrum antibacterial drug active against most Gram-negative bacteria, many Gram-positive bacteria and some anaerobes. Ciprofloxacin is the only other quinolone with superior in vitro antibacterial activity. However, the pharmacokinetic profile of ofloxacin is superior to that of ciprofloxacin, with more rapid absorption and a peak serum concentration several times higher. Moreover, ofloxacin achieves high concentrations in most tissues and body fluids. The results of clinical trials with ofloxacin have confirmed the potential for use in a wide range of infections, which was indicated by its in vitro antibacterial and pharmacokinetic profiles. It has proven effective against a high percentage of infections caused by Gram-negative organisms, slightly less effective against Gram-positive infections, and effective against some anaerobic infections. Clinical efficacy has also been confirmed in a variety of systemic infections as well as in acute and chronic urinary tract infections, and ofloxacin has generally appeared to be at least as effective as alternative orally administered antibacterial drugs. Ofloxacin is well tolerated and, although experience with the drug in clinical practice to date is limited, bacterial resistance does not appear to develop readily. Thus, ofloxacin is an orally active drug which offers a valuable alternative to other broad spectrum antibacterial drugs.
