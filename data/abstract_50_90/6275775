Migration of Tn 1 from plasmid RP4 into the chromosome of enteropathogenic Escherichia (EPE) of serogroups O124 and O111 was studied. E. coli K 12 LC 411 (RP4) was used as the donor. It was shown that the transposition rate markedly differed depending on the period of ;the cell isolation from Tn 1 in the chromosome, i. e. during conjugation or after several subcultures of the transconjugants from the autonomic plasmid onto the selective media. During the conjugation process the migration rate of Tn 1 was equal to 0.5 and 0.8 per cell acquiring the plasmid. The transposition rate in the EPE carrying the R factor for a long period of time was 2.4 . 10(-2) and 1.4 . 10(-2) respectively for each serogroup. The above differences in the migration rate of Tn 1 were not concerned with changes in the environment.
