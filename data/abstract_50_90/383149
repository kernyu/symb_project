Candida albicans cells have low levels of ergosterol when grown in ascorbic acid-supplemented media. When cells are grown in hydroquinone-supplemented media, the ergosterol levels became higher as compared to normal cells. The uptake of lysine, glycine, glutamic acid, proline, methionine and serine is reduced in hydroquinone-supplemented cells. In contrast to hydroquinone-supplemented cells, the rate and level of accumulation of these amino acids are higher in ascorbic acid-supplemented cells. Nystatin-resistant isolates of C. albicans with low ergosterol contents also exhibit an increased rate and level of accumulation of these amino acids. The uptake of phenylalanine and leucine remained unaffected by such a change in ergosterol levels brought about by different supplementation of the media. The results demonstrate a correlation between ergosterol levels and amino acids uptake. Contrary to various reports, the rate of K+ efflux does not seem to correlate with the amino acid uptake in C. albicans cells.
