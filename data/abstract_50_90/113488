The presence of 10 microM-Cu2+ increased the lethal effect of hydrogen peroxide on spores of Clostridium bifermentans but not on those of Clostridium sporogenes PA 3679, Clostridium perfringens, Bacillus cereus or Bacillus subtilis var. niger. Cu2+ at 100 muM also increased the lethal effect of heat on spores of C. bifermentans but not on those of B. sutilis var. niger. The rate and extent of Cu2+ uptake by spores of C. bifermentans and B. subtilis var. niger were similar, but examination of unstained sections of spores by electron microscopy suggested that Cu2+ is bound by the protoplasts of spores of C. bifermentans but not of B. subtilis var. niger.
