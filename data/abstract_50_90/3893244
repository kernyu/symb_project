During an epidemiologic study of poultry colisepticemia on 2 Saudi Arabian poultry broiler farms, Escherichia coli was isolated from 101 (40.4%) of the 250 specimens examined. The antigenic structure and the drug resistance pattern of 65.4% of the E coli isolates from different sources were used as epidemiologic markers to trace the source of the infection. The predominant E coli serotypes involved in infections of 2 poultry broiler progeny farms were 033:H4 (51.8%) and 078:H- (19.6%) that had the following respective drug resistance patterns: furazolidone-streptomycin-sulfathiazole and streptomycin-sulfathiazole-tetracycline. Escherichia coli strains with typical epidemiologic markers were isolated from various sources on a broiler breeding farm, but not from well waters of the infected progeny farm. Three other E coli serotypes (045:H10[14.3%], 0119:H27[1.8%], and 0145:H25[1.8%]) were involved in poultry infection, but to a lesser extent. These 3 serotypes were multiply resistant against 5 to 6 of the antimicrobials evaluated.
