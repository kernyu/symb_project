Results of continuing studies on the influence of dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) on reversion of sensitivity to rifampicin (RMP) and isonicotinic acid hydrazide (INH) in tubercle bacilli are reported. Nineteen strains of RMP-resistant bacilli, and 61 strains of IHN-resistant bacilli were studied. Reversion to INH sensitivity was obtained in 19 of the 61 resistant strains examined. Ten strains reverted completely, and 9 partly. All 19 RMP-resistant strains reverted to complete sensitivity.
