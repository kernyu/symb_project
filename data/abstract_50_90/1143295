No detectable induction of mutation to streptomycin resistance could be used in wild-type Micrococcus radiodurans and its radiation-sensitive and super-resistant mutants by ionizing or UV-radiation. N-methyl-N'-nito-N-nitrosoguanidine (NTG) was mutagenically active. The results suggest that repair of radiation-damaged DNA in Micrococcus radiodurans is mutation-proof.
