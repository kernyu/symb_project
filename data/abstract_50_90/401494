Transferable plasmids in gram-negative bacteria that confer resistance to potassium tellurite or tellurate were found. This re-istance was distinct from resistance to mercury, silver, or arsenic compounds and was unrelated to antibiotic resistance. In Escherichia coli, plasmids determine a 100-fold increase in the minimal inhibitory concentration for tellurite and a 10-fold increase in tellurate resistance. Many, but not all, of the plasmids belong to incompatibility group S. In Pseudomonas aeruginosa, tellurium resistance is specifically associated with incompatibility group P-2 and involves a 5- to 10-fold increase in tellurite or tellurate resistance.
