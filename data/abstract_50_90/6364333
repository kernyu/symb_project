In a double-blind, randomized trial twenty-six patients with non-specific vaginitis were treated with tinidazole/placebo (4 X 500 mg in one single dose). Thirteen patients received placebo, of which one was cured. Thirteen patients received tinidazole, of which six were cured. The nineteen non-responders received tinidazole (4 X 500 mg in one single dose), which resulted in the cure of eight patients (seven from the original placebo-group and one from the original tinidazole-group). Of the eleven patients not responding to tinidazole seven were successfully treated with metronidazole (250 mg, 4 times daily, for one week).
