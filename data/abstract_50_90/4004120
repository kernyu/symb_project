Cerebral cryptococcomas are not unusual and occurred in 7.8% of our cases of cryptococcal meningitis. This warrants a careful lookout for it if treatment is to be prompt and effective. CAT Scanning has proved to be an important adjunct in investigative exclusion of such instances. Although cerebrospinal fluid shunting proved to be of great importance in patients with demonstrable hydrocephalus, total surgical extirpation of the granuloma when demonstrated would appear to be essential, if cure is to be assured. 5-Fluorocytosine continues to be the drug of choice although recent indications of resistance to it are real. Modifications to antifungal chemotherapy will hence have to be judiciously made. Agglutination studies, besides typing, have indicated their usefulness in this regard, in the management of our cases.
