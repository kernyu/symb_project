Two rare species of Pseudomonas were isolated from corneal ulcers in two patients. In the first case P. acidovorans was isolated and suspected as the primary pathogenic microorganism in human disease. In the second case P. stutzeri was isolated from ocular sources, but this is the first report of its role in causing corneal disease. The patient in the second case had a scarred cornea, possibly caused by a previous herpetic infection, and this may have been a predisposing factor to the development of the infection by P. stutzeri. Susceptibility studies of both organisms revealed sensitivity to a wide range of antibiotics but resistance to carbenicillin, a drug currently used in the treatment of infections from P. aeruginosa.
