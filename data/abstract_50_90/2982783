Genetic and physical analyses were used to characterize the Bacteroides ovatus R plasmid pBI136. Results from restriction endonuclease cleavage studies were used to construct a physical map of the plasmid for the enzymes EcoRI, BamHI, ClaI, XbaI, SalI, and SmaI. Based on the sizes of restriction fragments generated in these studies, the plasmid was estimated to be 80.6 kilobase pairs (kb). A 7.2-kb region of the plasmid required for resistance to lincosamide and macrolide (LM) antibiotics was mapped by analysis of spontaneously occurring LM-sensitive deletion derivatives. Hybridization studies showed that this region and an adjoining 2.9-kb EcoRI fragment were responsible for the previously reported homology among Bacteroides plasmids pBF4, pBFTM10, and pBI136. Within this region of homology, 0.5 kb was attributed to a directly repeated sequence thought to bound the LM resistance determinant on pBF4 and pBFTM10. Two pBI136 EcoRI fragments spanning the putative LM resistance region were cloned in Escherichia coli, and heteroduplex analysis of these recombinant plasmids revealed the presence of a 1.2-kb directly repeated sequence. These results suggested that the pBI136 LM resistance determinant resides on an 8.4-kb segment of DNA containing 6.0 kb of intervening DNA sequences bounded by a 1.2-kb directly repeated sequence.
