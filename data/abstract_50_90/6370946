Swine from two herds with different histories of antibiotic exposure were fed diets containing 0 or 55 mg of chlortetracycline (CTC)/kg. One of five pigs in each herd-diet treatment group was infected orally with Escherichia coli strain BEL15R that was resistant to nalidixic acid (NA), chloramphenicol (C), streptomycin (S), sulfamethizole (TH) and tetracycline (TE). Effects of CTC on the quantity and duration of fecal shedding of E. coli BEL15R and on the transmission of strain BEL15R and its R-100 plasmid from infected pigs to uninfected pigs and chicks were determined. Quantity and duration of shedding were greater in infected antibiotic-herd pigs than in infected nonantibiotic-herd pigs. Feeding on CTC increased the duration of shedding in infected pigs from both herds. Strain BEL15R colonized and was shed in one uninfected antibiotic pig in each treatment group, but it did not colonize in any of the uninfected nonantibiotic-herd pigs or in the uninfected chicks. In vivo transfer of resistance to C, S, TH and TE occurred in the infected antibiotic-herd pigs but not in the infected nonantibiotic-herd pigs. Transfer of the R-100 plasmid occurred from the infected to the uninfected antibiotic-herd pigs and to the uninfected chicks housed near the antibiotic-herd pigs fed CTC, but not to the chicks housed with the antibiotic-herd pigs fed the control diet. No transfer of resistance occurred from the infected nonantibiotic-herd pigs fed either CTC or control diet.
