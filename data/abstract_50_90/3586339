Bacterial isolates from patients with pulmonary infections have been collected over the last 4 years in collaboration with investigators at 14 hospitals in various parts of Japan to study isolation frequency of pathogens from patients and drug susceptibilities of these isolates. Possible causative pathogens mainly isolated from sputum of patients with lower respiratory tract infections were collected during a period from September 1984 to March 1985. We first determined types of respiratory diseases and found that, between 1981 and 1983, 57.9 approximately 64.5% of the examined diseases were chronic respiratory infections such as chronic bronchitis, chronic bronchiolitis and bronchiectasis, and that these infections including diffuse panbronchiolitis accounted for 63.1% in 1984. Bacterial pneumonia was found to be 24.8% in 1981, but it was 11.0% in 1983 and 15.1% in 1984. These results seemed to reflect decreases in the occurrence of bacterial pneumonia in young population. We then investigated the correlations between these infections and isolates and found that distributions of causative organisms of chronic bronchitis and bronchiectasis during the 4 years were similar while the detection rate of Staphylococcus aureus from bacterial pneumonia increased in 1982 and 1983, and that of Gram-positive organisms such as Enterococcus faecalis rose in 1984. Branhamella catarrhalis was considered to be a non-pathogenic organism normally harbored in the upper respiratory tract. Recently, however, respiratory infections caused by this organism have been reported by some investigators. In our research also, this Gram-negative diplococcus was isolated as a causative organism of respiratory infections as 6 strains were found in 1983 and 29 strains in 1984, hence an increase was observed.
