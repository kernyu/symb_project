In French Guyana we have treated 72 paucibacillary leprosy with an association of Rifadine + Lamprene + Trecator + Disulone given twice monthly under supervision during 6 months. Results have been satisfying and side effects rare. The sequential character of treatment shows a substantial advantage on the operational side but may appear to be favorable to bacterial resistance.
