Cefroxadine (CXD) was studied in the field of obstetrics and gynecology and the following results were obtained. MIC values of CXD against 55 clinical isolates were investigated, from 6.25 to 12.5 micrograms/ml for 8 strains of E. coli, 6.25 micrograms/ml for 3 strains of K. pneumoniae and from 0.39 to 3.13 micrograms/ml for 9 strains of anaerobes such as Peptostreptococcus and Peptococcus in 10(6) cells/ml. Transfer of CXD into intrapelvic organ such as uterus, uterine tube and ovary after the oral administration of 500 mg was investigated. The concentrations in the tissues of genitalia ranged from 5.84 to 7.44 micrograms/g about 2 hours later after the administration. CXD was orally given to 18 patients with infections of genital organs at daily dose of 1,500 mg (500 mg 3 times a day). The clinical response was good, and efficacy rate was 88.9%. No remarkable side effects were observed.
