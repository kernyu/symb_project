Streptomyces achromogenes subsp. rubradiris plated at low density on 1,000 micrograms of spectinomycin per ml initially produces slow-growing, bald colonies from which arise, in a spatially and temporally random fashion, foci of rapidly growing aerial mycelium-forming cells whose DNA contains an approximately 200- to 300-fold amplification of an 8-kilobase (kb) sequence. This sequence was cloned in Escherichia coli on pBR322 and physically characterized. It was separately cloned also in Streptomyces lividans as a BglII fragment and shown to impart high-level resistance to spectinomycin in an orientation-independent manner when present in either the high-copy-number vector pIJ702 or the unit-copy-number vector pIJ943. A spectinomycin resistance determinant was shown to reside on a 1.7-kb SphI-BglII subfragment. Analysis of Southern blots of restriction enzyme digests of wild-type S. achromogenes DNA probed with the labeled 8-kb DNA sequence resulted in the identification and subsequent cloning in S. lividans of a 10.4-kb BamHI fragment which probably includes the complete 8.8-kb amplifiable unit of DNA. This unit is present in wild-type S. achromogenes and in the initially slow-growing, bald colonies arising on 1,000 micrograms of spectinomycin per ml as a single copy. It carries two 0.8-kb direct repeats at its termini as well as the spectinomycin resistance determinant close to one of these termini. About 5% of protoplast regenerants from wild-type S. achromogenes and 77% of protoplast regenerants from the rapidly growing strains lost both the ability to grow on spectinomycin at 10 micrograms/ml and the sequences that hybridize with the 8-kb probe DNA. The 1.7-kb Bg/II-SphI resistance fragment, when introduced via the vector pIJ702 into an S. achromogenes strain sensitive to 10 microgram of spectinomycin per ml, permitted its vigorous growth on 1,000 micrograms of the antibiotic per ml.
