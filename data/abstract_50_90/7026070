17 cases of resistant P. falciparum malaria are reported. They were observed in different populations: on one hand 9 Cambodian children refugees in France, on the other hand 8 French adults consulting after travels in South America or in South-East Asia. Different resistance levels to amino-4-quinolines and to a combination of sulfadoxine and pyrimethamine were found: they were more often from the RI type but sometimes from the RIII type also. 6 patients were treated with Mefloquine. Its activity was constant and rapid.
