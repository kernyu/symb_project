Plasmodium falciparum susceptibility to chloroquine and amodiaquine at a posology of 25 mg/kg per os in 3 days was evaluated in the pupils of 6 primary schools of South-West Cameroon during the first semester 1989. Parasitic index was 75%. Plasmodium falciparum was present in 96% of the infections 24% of the 357 children treated with chloroquine were carriers of trophozoites at D3 and 17% at D7. Complete resistance, at level R III, was observed in 4% of the children. By the 55 children treated with amodiaquine, 13% and 10% were carriers of few trophozoites at D3 and D7. The significance of these results is discussed.
