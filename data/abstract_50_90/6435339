The benzethonium chloride resistance of 341 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from Jikei University Hospital was determined. The distribution pattern of the susceptibility to benzethonium chloride clearly revealed two peaks, and the resistance was differentiated by 1000 micrograms/ml (0.1%) of benzethonium chloride. The frequency of resistance to benzethonium chloride was 51.6%. Furthermore, the frequencies of resistance to SM, TC, CP, KM, GM, PIP, Hg, Cd, As and chlorhexidine were 42.5, 15.8, 41.3, 29.6, 14.0, 8.2, 88.3, 97.9, 97.1, and 74.5%, respectively.
