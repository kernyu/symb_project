The increasing number of ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae recoveries have required a change in the treatment of meningitis due to this organism. Chloramphenicol has been recommended and is an effective though toxic substitute. Streptomycin combined with sulfisoxazole has been as effective as ampicillin in treating H influenzae meningitis. The results of treating 61 children with ampicillin were compared with results of those given streptomycin intramuscularly, in three intrathecal doses with sulfisoxazole intravenously, and by mouth to 50 children. Permanent neurological sequelae, including deafness, mental retardation, and persisting seizures, developed in the six given ampicillin; communic-ting hydrocephalus occurred in one who had been treated with streptomycin and sulfisoxazole. There was no phlebitis, buttocks abscess, or drug eruptions, and treatment was better tolerated in the streptomycin and sulfisoxazole group. This combination is suggested as an effective alternative to ampicillin.
