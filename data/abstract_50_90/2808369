In addition to its cytotoxic/cytostatic action on many tumor cells in vitro, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) was recently shown to stimulate the growth of some types of cells in culture. We examined the action of TNF in BALB/c 3T3 cells which have been used extensively to study growth regulation. In subconfluent, rapidly dividing 3T3 cultures, murine (Mu) TNF was cytotoxic, while human (Hu) TNF had virtually no antiproliferative action on the cells. In contrast, in density-arrested BALB/c 3T3 cells maintained in a chemically defined, serum-free medium, MuTNF produced a dose-dependent stimulation of DNA synthesis. In stimulating DNA synthesis, MuTNF acted synergistically with both epidermal growth factor or platelet-derived growth factor. While stimulating DNA synthesis in quiescent 3T3 cultures, high doses of MuTNF (100 or 10 ng/ml) were also cytotoxic for a portion of the cells in the same cultures. Cytotoxicity was apparent 2 h after the addition of MuTNF, well before the onset of DNA synthesis. BALB/c 3T3 cell variants selected for their resistance to the cytotoxic action of MuTNF retained the capacity to respond to the mitogenic action of MuTNF, indicating that the stimulation of DNA synthesis by TNF is not a consequence of a TNF "wounding effect." Addition of TNF to density-arrested 3T3 cells resulted in the release of free arachidonic acid and palmitic acid from the cells. Quinacrine, a phospholipase inhibitor, inhibited both cytotoxicity and DNA synthesis in response to TNF, and melittin, a phospholipase activator, mimicked both the cytotoxic and mitogenic actions of TNF in quiescent BALB/c 3T3 cells. These results suggest that phospholipid breakdown is part of the essential early signal transduction events required both for the cytotoxic and mitogenic response to TNF action.
