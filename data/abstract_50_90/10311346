Although antibiotic prescribing has historically been based on antimicrobial spectrum, the increasing numbers of agents with similar coverage have added new dimensions to antibiotic selection. P & T Committees must now evaluate antibiotics based on in vitro activity, pharmacokinetics, and resistance, as well as cost-effectiveness and dosing schedules. Issues may become confusing, and it is important to focus on what is most critical when making antibiotic formulary decisions. Perspectives are offered on the issues of antibiotic features, dosing schedules, and cost-containment; recommendations for optimal antibiotic therapy are made.
