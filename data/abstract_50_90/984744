The minimal inhibitory concentration of 10 antibiotics for 244 isolates of group B streptococci was determined. Susceptibility to penicillin G, ampicillin, cephalothin, chloramphenicol, and carbenicillin was uniform. Tetracycline and bacitracin resistance among these isolates was frequent (87.5 and 97.9%, respectively). Three strains (1.2%) failed to be inhibited by 100 mug of lincomycin or clindamycin per ml. Susceptibility of these 244 strains to the agents tested was unrelated to source of the isolate, year of isolation, or strain serotype. No apparent change in the suceptibility of group B streptococci to penicillin G has occurred during the past 2 decades.
