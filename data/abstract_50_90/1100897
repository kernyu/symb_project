Those who live in areas where Malaria is endemic, acquire immunity by continuous contact. This immunity cannot be acquired during a short holiday. Children in endemic areas acquire a more severe form of malaria during the period of developing immunity and more often suffer complications like acute hemolytic anemia and, in the case of plasmodium falciparum infection, cerebral malaria. This is a report of 39 cases of cerebral malaria which corresponds to an acute encephslopathy with high temperatures, generalized tonic-clonic spasms and unconsciousness. All children were between 6 months and 5 years old. Cerebral malaria at higher ages is rarely seen in Malawi. But its frequency depends on the intensity of endemic infection and the geographic distribution of the types of malaria. 11 (29%) of the 39 children died. Treatment was with chloroquine against which there was no resistance in East Africa for falciparum infections and with plasmaexpanders. In 1 case permanent neurologic changes a spastic cerebral paresis, were seen. Unconsciousness lasting more than 36 hours appears to be a bad prognostic sign. The CSF is clear and normal except for an occasional rise in protein never higher than 90 mg%.
