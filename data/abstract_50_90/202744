Human/mouse somatic cell hybrids with chromosome 21 as the only detectable human genetic material were sensitive to both human leukocyte and fibroblast interferons. The presence of additional human chromosomes decreased the amount of interferon needed to attain a given level of virus resistance. Decreased cytopathic effects, decreased virus yields, and the appearance of a specific phosphorylated protein associated with interferon treatment were all observed in hybrids maintaining only human chromosome 21. The phosphorylated protein found in extracts of these human interferon-treated hybrid cells was of mouse origin.
