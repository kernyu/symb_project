55 intensive care patients with an internal underlying disease were treated with cefotaxime, and 12 patients with bronchopulmonary infections were treated with the combination cefotaxime/ticarcillin. The following aspects were evaluated: clinical success, antimicrobial activity of bacteria in evidence before and after therapy, persistence of pathogens, and resistance. Renal function was monitored continuously in 21 patients over a period of 20 days in order to demonstrate nephrotoxic side-effects of cefotaxime when administered simultaneously with furosemide (in doses of mre than 1 g/day). In view of the clinical results and of the fact that the cefotaxime/ticarcillin combination is well tolerated by the kidneys, the possibility of efficient chemotherapy without aminoglycosides is being discussed for treatment of bronchopulmonary infections in patients under intensive care.
