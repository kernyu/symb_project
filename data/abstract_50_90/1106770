The nystatin induced conductivity of artificial phospholipid membranes containing ergosterol or 7-dehydrocholesterol drops sharply under the action of ultra-violet light as a result of the transformation of these provitamins into adequate D2 and D3 vitamins. The UV-light does not change the conductivity of the membranes containing cholestrol in nystatin solution. Nystatin slightly effects the membrane resistance in the presence of D2 and D3 vitamins.
