The epidemiology of aminoglycoside-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa was evaluated in an intensive care unit (ICU) with serial surveillance cultures of throat and rectum. Bacterial population analysis performed by replica plating of primary isolation plates onto gentamicin-containing agar revealed the presence of resistant subpopulations in the initial isolates from 41 (71%) of 58 consecutive assessable patients; these isolates were stably resistant and proportionately less susceptible to other aminoglycosides. An increase in resistant subpopulations occurred during the ICU stay in 34% of 38 colonized patients cultured serially as opposed to none of 23 followed after ICU discharge (P = .0008). Isolates of P. aeruginosa from patients who received aminoglycosides in the ICU were more likely to show an increase in resistance than were isolates from other patients (55% vs. 11%; P = .005); decreasing resistance after ICU discharge followed discontinuation of antibiotic administration. ICU mortality was higher in patients with increasingly resistant subpopulations (69% vs. 16%; P = .0004). The difficulty in treating infections with P. aeruginosa and in controlling drug resistance likely relates to the common carriage of clinically undetected resistant subpopulations that emerge during therapy.
