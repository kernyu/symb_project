The clinical and laboratory research into the immunological status of children with diabetes mellitus in the stage of clinicometabolic decompensation and investigation of the function of the insular apparatus of the pancreas according to the IRI and C-peptide data were carried out in 115 children aged 3 to 14 years with diabetes mellitus and 30 normal children. The data obtained indicate dysfunction of the immunogenesis system in children with diabetes mellitus and reduction of the functional potentialities of the insular apparatus of the pancreas. The immunological status of children with diabetes mellitus was characterized by dysimmunoglobulinemia at the expense of elevation of the IgA and reduction of IgG levels, deficiency of T cells and decrease in their function, elevation of the B lymphocyte level, reduction in non-specific defence factors. The degree of the abnormalities cited was in agreement with the standing and degree of pathological process, the levels of IRI and C-peptide, and insulin therapy. The immunological tests are helpful in the detection of insulin resistance of the immune type and in administering appropriate therapy. Insulin administered exogenously stimulates the B-lymphocyte component of the immunopoiesis.
