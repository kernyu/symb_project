The in vitro sensitivity of 132 gram positive and gram negative bacterial strains to Netilmycin and Ceftizoxime was assessed in order to update the statistics on the a priori efficacy of the antibacterial drugs. The flora studied were carefully selected as an extreme case of resistance to the standard antibiotics. Netilmycin was found to be effective against Staphylococci, Pseudomonas and Enterobacter, Ceftizoxime against Serratia, Acinetobacter, Proteus and Klebsiella. Both drugs were equally effective against E. coli and Citrobacter.
