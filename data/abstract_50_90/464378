A disseminated infection due to Mycobacterium chelonei occurred in a hemodialysis patient after rejection of his second renal transplant. Painful subcutaneous nodules and abscesses were found on both legs. Therapy with sulfisoxaxole and kanamycin produced a prompt response twice, as did sulfisoxazole alone on 2 additional occasions, despite resistance in vitro to both drugs. Clinical relapses occurred 3 times when administration of sulfisoxazole was discontinued.
