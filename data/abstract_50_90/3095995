In a retrospective study over a period from 1970 to 1984 the distribution of frequency and the behaviour of the resistance of urine germs out of more than 43,000 sendings from outpatient and hospital institutions of the county of Suhl were analysed. In the period of observation the proportion of isolated E. coli redoubled and was nearly 68% in 1984. Conspicuous were a decrease of the isolates of Str. faecalis from 32 to 4% and an increase of problem germs of the Klebsiella group to 9.7%. The resistance situation is characterized by a distinct decrease of the resistance of E. coli in comparison to antimicrobial substances with smaller consumption (sulphonamides, chloramphenicol, nitrafurantoin) without homogeneous behaviour of the problem germs.
