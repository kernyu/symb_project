Populations of cells suspended anaerobically in buffered (pH 4.5) M ethanol remained viable to a greater extent when their plasma membranes were enriched in linoleyl rather than oleyl residues irrespective of the nature of the sterol enrichment. However, populations with membranes enriched in ergosterol or stigmasterol and linoleyl residues were more resistant to ethanol than populations enriched in campesterol or cholesterol and linoleyl residues. Populations enriched in ergosterol and cetoleic acid lost viability at about the same rate as those enriched in oleyl residues, while populations grown in the presence of this sterol and palmitoleic acid were more resistant to ethanol. Suspending cells in buffered ethanol for up to 24 h did not lower the ethanol concentration.
