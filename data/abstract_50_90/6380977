There is no solid evidence that pregnancy has an adverse effect on tuberculosis. With early diagnosis and prompt, adequate chemotherapy, the outcome of pregnancy in a woman with tuberculosis is likely to be good. Routine therapeutic abortion is not indicated. Data in the literature do not support the notion that pregnancy is a major risk factor for the development of tuberculosis, although no well-designed studies have been conducted. Screening of pregnant patients for tuberculosis should be based on consideration of other proved risk factors not on the fact of pregnancy. Preventive therapy should be given during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy to selected patients at high risk of progressive disease developing. Treatment of disease should be instituted promptly when disease is detected. The preferred regimens are INH-EMB, INH-RIF, or INH-EMB-RIF, although other drugs may be needed if the disease is recurrent or if there is resistance to these primary drugs. Mothers taking antituberculosis drugs can nurse their infants with little risk. With proper medical management, both tuberculosis and pregnancy can be expected to reach a happy conclusion in virtually all cases.
