In comparative in vitro studies, broad spectrum penicillins and cephalosporins showed a relatively weak action in the range of beta-lactamase-positive bacteroides species (B. fragilis, B. thetaiotamicron) bacteroidaceae activity being otherwise good. Clindamycin was more effective against bacteroides species than against bacteria of the fusobacterium-sphaerophorus group. Metronidazole, however, showed no gap in its efficacy against bacteroidaceae, peptococcaceae and clostridium spp. with the exception of Propionibacterium acnes. The substance is therefore suitable alone and in combination for the chemotherapy of anaerobic infections.20
