Frequency of occurrence of fungal species distinct from C. albicans isolated from vaginal mucosa and their sensitivity to antimycotic chemotherapeutics was determined. Material consisted of 452 fungal strains isolated from vagina from patients suffering from afflictions within genital area. Fungal strains isolated belonged to 13 genera. Fungi distinct from C. albicans constituted 27.1% of all the strains. Fungi the most frequently isolated from vagina belonged to following genera: T. glabrata 35.2% C. krusei 18.4% C. pseudotropicalis 15.2% S. cerevisiae 10.4%. In the majority of cases of vaginal infections caused by fungi distinct from C. albicans, Lactobacillus sp. was present and normal pH values of vaginal content 3/4 with variable number of leucocytes were observed. Evaluation of sensitivity to antimycotic drugs of fungal strains was performed by agar dilution technique. In this study the following chemotherapeutics were assayed: nystatin, pimaricin, amphotericin B, flucytosine, clotrimazole, miconazole and ketoconazole. It is worth to underline resistance of T. glabrata and S. cerevisiae to clotrimazole and ketoconazole. Moreover, resistance of strains belonging to genera C. krusei and C. pseudotropicalis to amphotericin B and C. krusei strains to nystatin and flucytosine was noted.
