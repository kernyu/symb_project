Six cases of severe infections in pediatrics, which showed no or insufficient responses to treatment with antibiotics, were treated with additional intravenous infusion of SM-4300. Results were as follows. Three cases of bacterial infections with high fever, showing no response to chemotherapy, were treated with SM-4300, (68-135 mg/kg). Administration of SM-4300 resulted in defervescence, decreasing pain and swelling and showing a trend for improvement in CRP values. Administrations of SM-4300 (61-100 mg/kg) against pleurisy caused by Mycoplasma were effective in defervescence and improvement in chest findings. Clinical effects of SM-4300 were excellent in 2 cases, good in 3 and fair in 1. In this study, no clinical side reactions nor abnormal laboratory values in blood, liver or renal functions were observed.
