Using direct chimpanzee inoculation as an assay method, we tested the abilities of the following chemical or physical treatments to inactivate hepatitis B virus in human plasma: 1% aqueous glutaraldehyde at 24 degrees C for 5 min, 0.1% aqueous glutaraldehyde at 24 degrees C for 5 min, 80% ethyl alcohol at 11 degrees C for 2 min, and heat at 98 degrees C for 2 min. All treatments were shown to be effective, indicating that the resistance level of the hepatitis B virus is not extreme.
