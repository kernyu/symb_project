The clinical efficacy and tolerability of ciprofloxacin orally administered at the dosage of 250 mg twice a day was evaluated in 25 patients affected by acute bacterial pharyngotonsillitis. All patients were non-responders to previous conventional antibiotic therapies due to in vitro resistance of the responsible bacteria, or possibly the low antibiotic concentration at the infection site. None of the patients had infections caused by group A beta-haemolyticus streptococcus. Treatment with ciprofloxacin lasted for 5-10 days (mean 6.7). A favorable clinical response was observed in 92% of patients (15 resolutions and 7 improvements) at the end of the therapy and two weeks later (follow-up). One patient was not evaluable because of the unfortunate onset of glossitis that caused the interruption of the treatment. No other side-effects were recorded in the other 24 patients. The bacteriological response was excellent: 83% bacteriological eradication, 13% persistence and super-infection in only one patient (4%). Ciprofloxacin administered orally at low dosages is highly effective in the treatment of bacterial pharyngotonsillitis and is also well tolerated.
