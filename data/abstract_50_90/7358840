A long-term outbreak of urinary tract-associated multiply resistant Providencia stuartii occurred in a large medical facility that included a 513-bed chronic care unit. The unique characteristics of this outbreak were that from within a single medical facility, P. stuartii with multiple serotypes, biotypes, and antibiograms could be identified. The organisms isolated had five different biotypes, seven different antibiograms, and two major serotypes. All of the organisms were susceptible to amikacin, cefamandole, and cefoxitin. Application of standard infection control measures impeded the spread of this outbreak, and it slowly terminated 16 months later.
