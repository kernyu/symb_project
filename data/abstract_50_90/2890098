The regulation of IMP dehydrogenase (IMPDH) was analyzed in Chinese hamster V79 cell variants that exhibit different degrees of resistance to the cytotoxic effect of mycophenolic acid, a specific inhibitor of IMPDH. Western blot (immunoblot) analysis with an IMPDH antiserum revealed a 14- to 27-fold increase in the amount of enzyme in the mycophenolic acid-resistant cells. The antiserum was also used to screen for a phage containing the IMPDH cDNA sequence from a lambda gt11 expression library. Northern blot (RNA blot) analyses of total cellular and poly(A)+ RNA showed that an IMPDH cDNA probe hybridized to a 2.2-kilobase transcript, the amount of which was associated with increased resistance. Southern blotting with the probe indicated an amplification of the IMPDH gene in the mycophenolic acid-resistant cells. Our findings suggest that the acquired mycophenolic acid resistance of the V79 cell variants is associated with increases in the amount and activity of IMPDH and the number of IMPDH gene copies.
