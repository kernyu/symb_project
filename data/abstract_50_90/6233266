It is possible to select transmembrane potential (delta psi)-altered mutants in Streptococcus pneumoniae on the basis of their resistance to the antifolate methotrexate. Comparison of such a mutant strain ( amiA9 ) with its parent was used to evaluate the role of delta psi in the uptake of certain amino acids. The delta psi-dependent uptake of isoleucine, leucine, valine, and asparagine showed a reduced maximum velocity of uptake, and decrease in the transport constant of the energy-dependent, delta psi-independent uptake of lysine, methionine, and glutamine was observed. No reduction of the intracellular pool of ATP or of lactate excretion could be detected in the mutant strain. Moreover, studies on membrane preparations suggest that the phenotype expressed by the amiA mutation is not a consequence of alteration of its ATPase activity or susceptibility to N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide. Therefore, it is unlikely that the amiA mutation affects the H+ F1F0 ATPase which is involved in the establishment of the proton motive force in anaerobic bacteria. We propose that another function contributes to delta psi in S. pneumoniae. The amiA gene may be the structural gene of that function.
