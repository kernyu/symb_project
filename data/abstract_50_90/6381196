After the observation of decreasing insulin resistance in a diabetic patient during treatment with mebendazole for nematosis, we investigated the effect of mebendazole on metabolic control in six Type 1 (insulin-dependent) and six Type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) diabetic patients, eight of whom were chronically resistant to conventional treatment. Before and after mebendazole treatment for 1 month, plasma glucose and serum C-peptide concentrations were determined both fasting and 4 h after a mixed breakfast. Improvements in fasting blood glucose concentrations occurred in Type 1 (12.83 +/- 1.11 versus 6.56 +/- 0.56 mmol/l; p less than 0.05) and Type 2 (10.22 +/- 0.56 versus 7.56 +/- 0.67 mmol/l; p less than 0.05) diabetic patients and were associated with increases in post-cibal C-peptide responses in Type 1 and Type 2 diabetic patients. Following discontinuation of mebendazole, metabolic control deteriorated in five out of the six Type 1 diabetic patients and in all the Type 2 diabetic patients. We conclude that mebendazole increases insulin secretion, and decreases plasma glucose concentration in Type 1 and Type 2 diabetic patients. However, these beneficial effects may be transient.
