In experiments on HeLa cells a study was made of the response of near and distant descendants of irradiated cells to repeated irradiation and to the effect of inhibitors of repair and replicative synthesis of DNA, that is, arabinosyl cytosine (Ara-C) and hydroxyurea (HU). Throughout 12-15 postirradiation generations the descendants of preirradiated cells were more sensitive to ionizing radiation and to the effect of Ara-C and HU: the dose-response curves had no shoulder and the Do value decreased by 1.7 times. In generations 18 to 24, the sensitivity to the damaging effect of the agents under study was normalized and the resistance somewhat increased. The data obtained indicate that some DNA lesions persist in many generations of the exposed cells.
