We report here the physical structures of deletions and inversions promoted by the translocatable tetracycline-resistance element Tn10. DNA/DNA heteroduplex and restriction enzyme analyses of alterations in the genome of bacteriophage lambda suggest that both types of DNA alterations almost always originate at the internal termini of the 1400 bp terminal inverted repetitions of Tn10. Tn10-promoted deletions remove a single contiguous DNA segment beginning at one such terminus; Tn10-promoted inversions are more complex, and involve both an inversion and a specific deletion of Tn10 DNA.
