A method is described for the rapid, simultaneous determination of the MIC's of chloramphenicol and ampicillin to Haemophilus influenzae. Excellent agreement was observed between the Autobac method and the agar dilution method for antimicrobial susceptibility. All ampicillin resistant Haemophilus isolates produced beta lactamase and none of the suceptible strains produced this enzyme.
