Isolates of group D streptococci from above and below a sewer outfall and a series of clinical isolates have been speciated to sub-species level. From below the sewer outfall, Streptococcus faecalis var. faecalis predominates whereas above the outfall, S. faecium var. casseliflavus predominates. S. faecalis var. faecalis, S. faecalis var. liquefaciens and S. faecalis var. zymogenes were the predominant sub-species in the clinical isolates where S. faecium var. casseliflavus was virtually absent. S. faecalis var. liquefaciens and S. faecalis var. zymogenes were uncommon in the environmental isolates. S. faecium and S. durans were more abundant in the environmental than in the clinical isolates. The use of group D streptococci as indicators of faecal pollution would seem more suited to higher, rather than lower, levels of pollution. A statistically significant increase in resistance to antibiotics (ampicillin, penicillin, streptomycin, gentamicin, erythromycin and tetracycline) was seen in isolates from below the outfall compared with those from above and a further significant increase was seen in the clinical isolates compared with the former. Resistance to tetracycline was most common and ampicillin was the only antibiotic tested to which no resistance was detected. Multiple antibiotic resistance was rare in the environmental isolates. Even in moderately polluted water, there is not a large pool of antibiotic resistance.
