R483, an I pilus-determining plasmid previously reported as belonging to a distinct incompatibility group Ibeta, proved to be an atypical Ialpha plasmid; in a growing culture, the degree of inhibition of replication of one Ialpha plasmid by the presence of another was not uniform within the Ialpha group.
