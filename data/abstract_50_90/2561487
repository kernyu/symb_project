The aphD gene of Streptomyces griseus, encoding a streptomycin 6-phosphotransferase (SPH), was sub-cloned in the pBR322-based expression vector pRK9 (which contains the Serratia marcescens trp promoter) with selection for expression of streptomycin resistance in Escherichia coli. Two hybrid plasmids, pCKL631 and pCKL711, were isolated which conferred resistance. Both contained a approximately 2 kbp fragment already suspected to include aphD. The properties of in vitro deletion derivatives of these plasmids were consistent with the presumed location of aphD. In vitro deletion of a sequence including most of the trp promoter largely, but not quite completely, abolished the ability of the plasmid to confer streptomycin resistance, confirming that expression was indeed principally from the trp promoter. A polypeptide of approximately 34.5 kDa was present in minicells containing plasmids that conferred streptomycin resistance, but was absent when the plasmids contained in vitro deletions removing streptomycin resistance. Part of the fragment was sequenced and an open reading frame corresponding to aphD identified. A computer-assisted comparison of the deduced SPH sequence with those of other antibiotic phosphotransferases suggested a common structure A-B-C-D-E, where B and D were conserved between all sequences compared while A, C and E divided between the streptomycin and hygromycin B phosphotransferases on one hand and kanamycin/neomycin ones on the other. A composite sequence data base was searched for homologues to consensus matrices constructed from five approximately 12-residue subsequences within blocks B and D. For one subsequence, corresponding to the N-terminal portion of block D, those sequences from the database that yielded the highest homology scores comprised almost entirely either antibiotic phosphotransferases or eukaryotic protein kinases. Possible evolutionary implications of this homology, previously described by other groups, are discussed.
