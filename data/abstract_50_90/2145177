Selective breeding has produced replicate lines of mice that are prone (WSP) or resistant (WSR) to ethanol withdrawal seizures. Ethanol-naive WSP mice inherently have a greater number of hippocampal binding sites for the NMDA receptor-gated ion channel blocker, MK-801, than ethanol-naive WSR mice. After chronic ethanol ingestion, hippocampal (but not cerebral cortical) MK-801 binding sites increase in both lines of mice. However, the number of MK-801 binding sites in the ethanol-treated WSR mice does not exceed the number of MK-801 binding sites in untreated WSP mice. At the time of ethanol withdrawal, the number of hippocampal MK-801 binding sites in each line of WSP mice is 50-70% higher than the number of such sites in WSR mice. Given the past evidence for a role of the NMDA receptor in seizures, the results implicate hippocampal NMDA receptor-gated channels in the generation of ethanol withdrawal seizures.
