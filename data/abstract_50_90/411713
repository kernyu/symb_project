Cycloheximide resistance in Tetrahymena is inducible by mutagenesis. Two mutations, isolated independently from genetically different strains, were analyzed. The two mutations, Chx-1 and Chx-2, were found to be alleles at the same locus. A specific analysis is presented which may serve as a model for strategies employing an independent manipulation of the micro-and macronuclei of this organism for genetic studies.
