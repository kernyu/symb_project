Ten adult patients with severe atopic dermatitis were treated for three months with estatin, which is a metabolite of Streptomyces olivoreticuli. Bestatin has been shown to increase tumor resistance in mice, augment a variety of immune responses and to reduce the level of IgE in non-atopic healthy persons. During bestatin therapy we were not able to see any clinical change of the atopic dermatitis. No influence was found on the concentration of IgE in serum and the number of eosinophils in blood. The percentage of T lymphocytes and the Con A-induced suppressor cell activity was not changed. (Received June 18, 1983.)
