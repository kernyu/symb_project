Nine cases of superficial pemphigus that were treated by dapsone as the initial mode of therapy are reported. Five patients, all having low or negative serum anti-intercellular cement substance antibody titers, responded dramatically, while the other four patients, showing high titers of anti-intercellular cement substance antibodies, did not respond to this treatment. Complications of therapy were observed in three cases.
