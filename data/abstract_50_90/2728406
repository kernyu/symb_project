It was established that classical fowl plague virus Rostock (H7N1) propagated in culture to which 10-25 micrograms/ml of remantadine had been added differed from the original FPV and its remantadine-resistant variant by markedly reduced infectious and hemagglutinating activity and, to a lesser extent, neuraminidase activity, lower amounts of M protein and hemagglutinin, incomplete cleavage of hemagglutinin, and significant loss of spikes on the virion surface.
