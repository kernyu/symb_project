Staphylococcus aureus is a ubiquitous organism that is normally carried on the skin and body surfaces of man. The nares are sites frequently colonized, and patients and hospital personnel represent the major source of infection. The occurrence of staphylococcal infection depends on the availability of staphylococci and the host resistance to infection. Factors that influence the carrier rate of S. aureus include minimal colonizing dose, effects of antimicrobial therapy, disinfectants in the environment, coincidental respiratory infections, possible effect of immune factors, duration of hospital stay, and regular needle injections. Certain patients such as drug abusers, patients with diabetes, and patients with chronic renal failure are at high risk of S. aureus infections. although underlying immune deficiencies are present, increased carrier rate also might be related to regular needle use, as shown among allergy patients. The significance of carrier state has been defined in outbreaks in hospital nurseries, postoperative patients, and systemic infections such as endocarditis in the drug abuser, the toxic shock syndrome, and dermatologic infections.
