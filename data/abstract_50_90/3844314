The incidence of methicillin-resistant staphylococcal infections, for which vancomycin hydrochloride remains the only active cell-wall antibiotic therapy, is rising. Some physicians have been combining other antibiotics with vancomycin in hopes of obtaining a more effective regimen for the therapy of these infections. Rifampin has been advocated as a concurrent second antibiotic because of its extraordinary potent bactericidal activity for Staphylococcus aureus. When rifampin is used in combination with a cell-wall antibiotic, suppression of the development of rifampin resistance has been thought possible. We report a case of infection caused by a methicillin-resistant S aureus in which the rifampin resistance occurred during therapy with vancomycin and rifampin. The rifampin resistance was stable and was present after ten serial broth and agar passages. Physicians are cautioned against the indiscriminant or routine use of rifampin as a second antibiotic in combination with vancomycin for the therapy of infections caused by S aureus.
