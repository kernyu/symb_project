Petite deletion mapping helped to generate a fine-structure genetic map of the Oli-2 region of the mitochondrial genome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Here we report the DNA sequence analysis of the Oli-2 region from two drug-resistant alleles (Olir2-76 and Ossr1-92) which are located in the gene for subunit-6 of mitochondrial ATPase, in agreement with their genetic locations on the mitochondrial genome. An analysis of the corresponding amino-acid substitutions is also presented in the context of protein-antibiotic interactions.
