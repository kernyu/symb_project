The Emr, Kmr, and Smr determinants of the Streptococcus faecalis R plasmid pJH1 were cloned in Streptococcus sanguis with a streptococcal plasmid vector, pVA380-1. Each cloned determinant was used as a probe in hybridization reactions with dot blots containing plasmid-enriched DNA from 91 group D streptococcal isolates resistant to erythromycin, kanamycin, and streptomycin; the isolates were obtained from animal and human sources in a variety of geographical locations. Nearly 70% of the strains contained DNA that hybridized to each of the three resistance determinants from pJH1. Five plasmids mediating resistance to erythromycin, kanamycin, and streptomycin were examined in more detail. These plasmids varied in size between 26 and 105 kilobase pairs (kbp) and exhibited very different EcoRI restriction patterns. However, each plasmid contained the resistance determinants on a single 13- to 20-kbp EcoRI fragment. Southern blot hybridizations and additional restriction endonuclease digests revealed extensive DNA sequence homology and virtually indistinguishable restriction endonuclease maps within a 9- to 11-kbp region of each plasmid which included the resistance determinants.
