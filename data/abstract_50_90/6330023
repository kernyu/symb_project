We have further characterized the transposon Tn5-facilitated chromosomal gene transfer system developed for Agrobacterium tumefaciens 15955. Using a strain whose chromosome contained Tn5, we compared the chromosome-mobilizing ability of plasmid pDP37 (containing Tn5) with that of its parent plasmid R68.45. For R68.45, we observed nonpolar transmission from multiple origins. For pDP37 we found polarized transmission from a single origin near ilv. When we examined the transmission gradients of a number of pDP37-containing donor strains each differing at the site of the chromosomal insertion we found just two classes. One set of donors transmitted markers with a gradient of Ilv+ greater than Rifr greater than His+ greater than Met+, whereas the second set transferred His+ greater than Rifr greater than Ilv+ greater than Met+. Using representatives from each transmission class of donor strains, we conducted matings to measure the degree of linkage between pairs of adjacent donor markers. From this information we developed a map of the A. tumefaciens 15955 chromosome. Attempts to isolate R-prime plasmids or Hfr-like donors were unsuccessful.
