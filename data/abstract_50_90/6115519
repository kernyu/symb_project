Three cases of penicillin-resistant gonorrhoea were detected at Bremen during a period of 3 months: in a tourist and 2 sailors. The infections had been acquired in Thailand, Africa, and USA, respectively. In all 3 cases penicillinase-producing strains of gonococci were isolated, resistant to penicillin in concentrations of 20 micrograms/ml and more. Patients were successfully treated with spectinomycin. The identification of penicillinase-producing strains of gonococci is of major epidemiological importance. Therefore, bacteriological investigations including sensitivity tests and, if necessary, penicillinase-tests should be done in each case of penicillin-resistant gonorrhoea. Relevant cases should be reported to the Venereal Diseases and Treponematoses Unit at Geneva, Switzerland.
