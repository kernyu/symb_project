Antibiotic sensitivity of E. coli O-124, Salmonella and Shigella sonnei isolated from patients during 1968-1972 was studied with the disc method. Increase in the resistance levels to monomycin and neomycin in E. coli O-124 was observed. Sensitivity of Salmonella and Shigella sonnei to some antibiotics did not practically change.
