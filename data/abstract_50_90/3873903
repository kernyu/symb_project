A constitutively produced beta-lactamase was purified from Flavobacterium odoratum GN14053. The purified enzyme gave a single protein band on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The isoelectric point was 5.8, and the molecular weight was estimated to be about 26,000. The enzyme activity was inhibited by EDTA, iodine, p-chloromercuribenzoate, HgCl2, and CuSO4 but not by clavulanic acid, sulbactam, imipenem, and cephamycin derivatives. The enzyme showed a broad substrate profile, hydrolyzing oxyiminocephalosporins, cephamycins, imipenem, and some penicillins.
