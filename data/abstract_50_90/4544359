Near-ultraviolet (UV) light (325 to 400 nm), in the presence of air and the absence of exogenous photosensitizing compounds, is lethal and mutagenic for Haemophilus influenzae. The lethal effect is the same for both wild type and streptomycin-resistant mutants, indicating that the mutants are not selected by the irradiation. The inactivation and mutagenicity show a large shoulder, suggesting the existence of repair systems. Filters were used to eliminate the possibility of short-UV irradiation. The effective radiation is between 325 to 400 nm. The lethal and mutagenic effects are higher during mid and late log phase than during early log or stationary phase.
