Treatment of visceral and cutaneous leishmaniasis rests on pentavalent antimonial drugs. However, side effects are often a problem and resistance may emerge. N-methyl-glucamine given for kala-azar induced hematologic or hepatic toxicity in three patients and failed in two. Four patients with cutaneous leishmaniasis recovered but two exhibited adverse side effects. Sodium stibo-gluconate failed in one of three kala-azar patients and in one of two patients with cutaneous leishmaniasis. The effects of these two drugs are discussed, as well as indications of pentamidine and splenectomy.
