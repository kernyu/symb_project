After a short description of the discovery of bacteriocins, especially the colicins in this review the following points are discussed: the classification of colicins especially with the aid of resistant mutants of sensitive indicator strains, the bacteriocin-receptors, the bacteriocin-specificity, and the possible ways of transport of colicins across the outer membrane.
