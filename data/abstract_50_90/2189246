In 120 adult Vietnamese patients with uncomplicated falciparum malaria the efficacy of, and tolerance to, mefloquine (M) vs the combination of mefloquine + sulfadoxine + pyrimethamine (MSP) was studied in a double-blind, randomized comparative trial with chloroquine. Also, a double-blind dose finding study of MSP was performed in 120 Vietnamese children with uncomplicated falciparum malaria. In the adults the mean parasite clearance time with M was 3.8 d and with MSP 3.6 d. Defervescence occurred in 2.9 and 3.0 d respectively for M and MSP. There was a 36.8% resistance rate in 38 patients treated with chloroquine. 96% of the children were sensitive or showed a delayed RI response. The lowest dose of MSP (10 mg/kg M + 20 mg/kg S + 1.0 mg/kg P, 1 tablet Fansimef) was as effective as 1.5-2x this dose in children weighing 23-30 kg. Side effects were mild, except for vomiting which required alternative therapy in 4 patients.
