Sultamicillin fine granules (SBTPC), a mutual prodrug of sulbactam (SBT) and ampicillin (ABPC), were administered to 16 pediatric patients with bacterial infections. The efficacy rate was 93.3%. MICs (10(6) cells/ml) of SBTPC against beta-lactamase non-producing strains were not significantly different from those of ABPC, and ranged from less than or equal to 0.05 to 1.56 micrograms/ml. MICs of SBTPC, however, were 2-4 fold smaller than MICs of ABPC against beta-lactamase producing strains. Diarrhea and loose stool as side effects were observed in 4 (25%) of 16 patients, but none of them were severe. After oral administration of SBTPC (10 mg/kg), serum levels of ABPC and SBT peaked at 3.41 micrograms/ml and 2.43 micrograms/ml after 0.6 hour, and declined with half-lives of 1.79 and 1.00 hours, respectively.
