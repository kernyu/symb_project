The influence of cyclosporin A (CsA) on the interleukin 2 (IL 2)-driven proliferation of allo-activated human T lymphocytes has been studied. CsA (50, 100, and 250 ng/ml) appeared to affect the IL 2-driven proliferation. The impaired proliferation could not be reversed with exogenous interferon-gamma. The doubling time of the cell populations appeared to increase with higher CsA doses. The cytotoxic capacity of the cells was also strongly inhibited by CsA. The cells regained proliferative and cytotoxic properties after CsA has been removed and cells were additionally cultured in normal medium. The data strongly suggest that CsA has an inhibitory influence on essential basic processes in T cells.
