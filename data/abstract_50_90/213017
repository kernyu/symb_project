Sucrose-lysozyme spheroplasts were prepared from two strains of Pseudomonas cepacia and tested for susceptibility to polymyxin B and benzalkonium chloride. Spheroplasts were more susceptible than whole cells to benzalkonium chloride but not to polymyxin B. Disruption of the outer membrane layer was not by itself sufficient to render P. cepacia susceptible to polymyxin B.
