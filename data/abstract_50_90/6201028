The fraction of hnRNA synthesized in the presence of DRB in uninfected HeLa cells ranges in size from 4S to over 45S. High molecular weight DRB-resistant hnRNA has been demonstrated to decay after 2 h of actinomycin D chase. This fraction is composed of both poly(A)(+) and poly(A)(-) RNA molecules. The synthesis in the presence of DRB of short polyadenylated hnRNA was also observed. The nature of both hnRNA subfractions is discussed.
