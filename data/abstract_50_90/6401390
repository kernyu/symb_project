Enterococcal pneumonia occurred as a superinfection in two patients who received broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy. Both patients were receiving enteral hyperalimentation by Dobb-Hoff tube. The organism was isolated from transtracheal aspirate in pure culture and gram-positive cocci were visible on gram-stained smear. Enterococcal pneumonia may occur in patients receiving cephalosporin-aminoglycoside therapy, and may be anticipated as a consequence of third-generation cephalosporin therapy.
