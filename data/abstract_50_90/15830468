Everninomicins B and D are components of a complex of antibiotic substances produced by Micromonospora. Both were shown to be highly active inhibitors of growth of all gram-positive bacteria, Neisseria, and Bacteroides studied in vitro. Potency of activity appeared to be greater than that of chloramphenicol, but less than that of penicillin G, when assayed against strains susceptible to each of the drugs. The everninomicins were bacteriostatic for all strains tested, except group A streptococci. No facultatively anaerobic gram-negative bacilli were susceptible. Resistant mutants were selected with difficulty from susceptible staphylococci in the laboratory, and these demonstrated no cross-resistance to available antimicrobial agents. Most variations in media, growth conditions, or procedure of assay had little or no effect on antimicrobial activity. Only addition of serum or increase in inoculum size reduced antibacterial activity. Significant differences in activity of the two components were encountered infrequently; the B component was four- to sixfold more active against gonococci and group A streptococci, whereas the D component was fourfold more active against enterococci. Because of the high degree of in vitro activity and lack of resistance among susceptible genera of bacteria, the everninomicins clearly merit further careful study as potential therapeutic agents.
