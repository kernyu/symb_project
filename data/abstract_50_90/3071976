46 isolates of Plasmodium falciparum collected in the Tolagnaro (Fort Dauphin) area of Southeast Madagascar were assessed with WHO in vitro micro-technique test kits to determine their susceptibility to chloroquine and mefloquine. The results of the tests indicated low grade resistance to chloroquine and satisfactory response to mefloquine.
