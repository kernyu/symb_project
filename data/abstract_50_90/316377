The activity of erythromycin stearate in respiratory tract infections was evaluated. This study involved 269 out-patients. Of these, 76 satisfied the strict criteria for detailed bacteriological study with positive cultures of a known pathogen before treatment and bacteriological follow-up after treatment. The results of erythromycin stearate were good against the haemolytic streptococcal infections. The activity of this antibiotic was shown to be insufficient against Haemophilus influenzae. A second clinical trial with 20 patients with acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis demonstrated quite good activity from erythromycin ethylsuccinate and no intolerance when administered in a dose of 1 g q.i.d. The administration of 1 g of the ethylsuccinate immediately after a meal gave a peak serum concentration after 60 min of 3.36 micrograms/ml. Blood levels on the fourth day of this treatment showed some accumulation, concentrations of greater than 4 micrograms/ml being found at 30, 60 and 90 min after the dose. With its good absorption, its lack of toxicity and its reputation for good diffusion into bronchial secretions, we consider that erythromycin ethylsuccinate should have a major place in the treatment of respiratory tract infections.
