Spores of Bacillus subtilis NCTC 10073 were examined for susceptibility to two proprietary brands of povidone-iodine: an aqueous solution, Betadine and an alcoholic solution, Videne. Spores were converted to ion-exchange (Ca, H) and coat-defective (SLS-, UME-, UMS-, UDT- and UDS-treated) forms. The resistance of these to povidone-iodine was compared and related to uptake. Effects on spore protoplasts and cortex in relation to hexosamine release were also examined. The degree of spore penetration and site of action of povidone-iodine is discussed.
