This work report a study of antibacterial activity of eight third generation cephalosporins : cefotaxime, moxalactam, cefoperazone, cefotiam, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, cefmenoxime and cefotetan. The essential interest of these antibiotics is their activity against Enterobacteriaceae resistant to cefalothin ; however, five of them are clearly superior ; cefotaxime, moxalactam, cefmenoxime, ceftriaxone and ceftazidime. Ceftazidime is the best against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and moxalactam against the Bacteroides group. Against others bacterial groups, these new cephalosporins are not superior to former products.
