Two high copy number, broad host range, general purpose cloning vectors, pLG5 and pLG10, derived from the unstable Streptomyces niveus plasmid pSN2 are described. pLG5 (5.5 kb) and pLG10 (6.5 kb) both carry the thiostrepton resistance (TsrR) and lethal zygosis (Ltz+) markers and have single cloning sites within a non-essential region and the tsr gene. pLG505 (7.4 kb) was constructed by cloning the viomycin resistance (vph) gene into the single BamHI site of pLG5 to give a further vector with insertion and replacement sites which inactivate either the TsrR or VioR functions.
