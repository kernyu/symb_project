Cefteram pivoxil (CFTM-PI), a new ester type cephem antibiotic, was administered at a daily dose of 600 mg to 81 patients with respiratory infections. They included 4 cases of laryngopharyngitis, 5 cases of tonsillitis, 26 cases of acute bronchitis, 13 cases of pneumonia, 10 cases of chronic bronchitis, 1 case of diffuse panbronchiolitis, 14 cases of infected bronchiectasis and 8 cases of infected other chronic respiratory diseases. Clinical effects were excellent in 18 cases, good in 50 cases, fair in 7 cases, and poor in 6 cases, thus, the efficacy rate was 84.0%. Nausea was observed in 2 cases, and diarrhea, vertigo, or fever was observed in 1 case each. The elevation of GOT and GPT values were found in 4 cases and a slight elevation of total bilirubin value was found in 1 case. These adverse reactions, however, were slight in their grades. CFTM-PI appears to be a useful oral cephem antibiotic in the treatment of respiratory infections.
