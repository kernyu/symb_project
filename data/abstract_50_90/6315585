Immune modulators injected 24 h before encephalomyocarditis virus significantly increase antiviral resistance in mice when interferon is administered 1 h after the virus. These immune modulators can be crude bacterial extracts or synthetic drugs. In some cases, the responses are additive; in others, they are clearly cooperative. To protect the mice against the development of 180 TG Crocker sarcomas, the association of bacterial extracts and interferon is highly effective under the condition that the drug concentrations and chronological order and number of injections are well defined. In contrast, the conjunction of interferon and synthetic immune modulators, in particular cimetidine, result in delayed tumor development with no significant change in the final survival rate in the experimental model described here.
