Some antifungal agents have been tested qualitatively in various associations against species of Candida, Cryptococcus and Torulopsis. The method used was the channel test and the results are confirmed by comparison with the serial dilution test in agar. The antagonism in vitro with the combination of amphotericin B imidazole suggests that caution must be exercised before prescribing the antifungal drugs in combination for man. The frequent synergy of flucytosine with econazole is, however, encouraging because of the low toxicity of the 2 drugs. Under the limited conditions described, the combination of flucytosine and amphotericin B was not found synergistic but additive on the strains of C. albicans used in this study. This combination was found synergistic for a strain of C. parapsilosis and is useful for avoiding resistance to flucytosine.
