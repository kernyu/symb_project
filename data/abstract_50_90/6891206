A nystatin-resistant mutant of Rhodotorula gracilis was obtained by treatment of the wild strain cells with N-methyl-N-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine and selected on agar plates containing 150 micrograms nystatin/ml. Three important transport functions of the plasma membrane of mutant cells: the accumulation of monosaccharides, the generation and maintenance of the pH-gradient and of the membrane potential, as well as the cell respiration were insensitive to at least 10(-5) M nystatin. This concentration of nystatin inhibited completely all these processes in wild strain cells. Analysis of cellular sterols revealed a defect of ergosterol biosynthesis in the mutant, which was localized at the last oxidative step between 5,6-dihydroergosterol and ergosterol.
