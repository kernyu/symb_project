A lung abscess and persistent bacteremia due to Corynebacterium equi are described in a bisexual man with the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). Eleven of the 12 previously reported cases have occurred in immunocompromised humans. The occurrence of this infection in a patient with AIDS has not been previously described. Development of resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics was noted following initial therapy. Because this organism resembles nonpathogenic organisms, it may easily be overlooked despite its ability to cause serious infection and persist even with aggressive antimicrobial and surgical therapy.
