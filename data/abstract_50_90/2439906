Natural killer (NK) activity of spleen cells was studied in DBA/2 mice, 24 and 72 h after intravenous injection of various muramyl peptides: muramyl dipeptide (MDP) and derivatives which are both adjuvant-active and able to increase resistance against Klebsiella pneumoniae; derivatives which are adjuvant-active but devoid of anti-infectious properties; derivatives which are anti-infectious but devoid of adjuvant activity, and derivatives which are devoid of both activities such as the stereoisomer MDP[D-Ala]1. An early increase in NK activity was observed 24 h after injection of all nonadjuvant derivatives, whatever their effect on infection. A stimulation of natural cytotoxicity was always induced 72 h after injection of MDP and derivatives able to protect mice against Klebsiella pneumoniae infection. So, even if the reverse was not true, there seems to exist some correlation between the anti-infectious effect of muramyl peptides and the late increase in NK activity. The modulation of NK activity by muramyl peptides appeared to be independent of interferon production. Moreover, inhibition of the stimulatory effect by a cell cycle-specific drug, hydroxyurea, observed 72 h after MDP suggests a requirement for proliferation.
