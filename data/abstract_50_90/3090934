The results of the study on antibiotic resistance of 745 strains of P. aeruginosa isolated in hospitals from surgical patients, environment and carriers are presented. 89.7 per cent of the strains were typed by the commercial O-sera. The isolates were most sensitive to tobramycin (99 per cent), amikacin (95.1 per cent), cefsulodin (95.1 per cent), polymyxin (89.7 per cent) and gentamicin (73.5 per cent). Comparison of the antibiotic resistance of the typed and nontyped cultures revealed that the former were more resistant to tetracycline, carbenicillin, rifampicin, kanamycin and cefotaxim, while the latter were more resistant to gentamicin and polymyxin. It was also noted that the proportion of the strains resistant to all of the tested antibiotics was higher among the nontyped cultures. Antibiotic sensitivity of P. aeruginosa was in many respects defined by the strain origin: the strains isolated from patients were more resistant to tetracycline, carbenicillin, rifampicin, cefotaxim and kanamycin and more sensitive to gentamicin and polymyxin than the strains isolated from the environment. The cultures belonging to different O-serogroups (O-11 and O-2) markedly differed by their antibioticograms.
