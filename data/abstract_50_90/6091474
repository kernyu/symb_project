A prospective, double-blind trial of a single preoperative dose of ceftriaxone, a new long-acting cephalosporin, versus one preoperative and three postoperative doses of cefazolin was carried out in 81 patients at high risk of infection after biliary surgery. Indications for antibiotic prophylaxis included recent or ongoing cholecystitis (52 patients), common duct stones (14 patients), common duct obstruction (3 patients), and age greater than 70 years (22 patients). Intraoperative bile cultures were positive in 7 of 41 patients (17.1 percent) given ceftriaxone and 12 of 40 patients (30 percent) given cefazolin, but there were no wound infections in either group. Neither regimen was associated with significant antibiotic resistance. Side effects, such as proteinuria and elevated liver transaminases and alkaline phosphatase levels, were transient and not definitely related to the antibiotics. We conclude that a single preoperative dose of ceftriaxone is as effective as multiple perioperative doses of cefazolin in the prophylaxis of infection associated with biliary tract surgery.
