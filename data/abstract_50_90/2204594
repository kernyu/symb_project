Seventy-two consecutive and previously untreated adults with acute non-lymphoblastic leukaemia (ANLL), having a median age of 36 years (range 12 to 71), were prospectively randomised to receive conventional doses of cytosine arabinoside and doxorubicin combined with either etoposide (CTR III) or 6-thioguanine (DAT). Morbidity was comparable between the two regimens and complete remission (CR) rates of 52% and 62% respectively (p greater than 0.50) were not influenced by age above or below 50 years, initial white cell count, French-American-British classification, or race. However, growth pattern in the GM: CFUc assay was found to identify a subgroup of patients who had a significantly higher CR rate. Similarly, the secretion of tissue plasminogen activator by leukaemic blasts in vitro uniformly predicted for primary drug resistance, whereas a CR rate of 68% was associated with production of the urokinase type or a mixture of both enzymes. Remission duration and survival did not differ between these two forms of chemotherapy, nor were they influenced by immunotherapy with C. parvum or the duration of maintenance therapy, whereas age below 50 and the species of plasminogen activator secreted were significant prognostic factors. It is concluded that etoposide can be substituted for 6-thioguanine in these cytosine arabinoside and doxorubicin-containing regimens and that for both combinations the most sensitive prognostic factor for CR and survival is the species of plasminogen activator secreted in vitro by the leukaemic blasts.
