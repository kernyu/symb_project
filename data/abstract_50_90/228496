After contact with mouse culture interferon in the cold, the resistance to viruses in L cells develops only after the cells are placed into a thermostate at 37 degrees C. The use of colcemide destroying microtubules prevents the development of this resistance at an early (actinomycin-sensitive) stage of interferon-cell interaction. In the actinomycin-resistant stage, however, colcemide practically exerts no influence on the interferon-induced resistance to viruses.
