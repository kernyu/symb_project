The phenotypic features of novobiocin-sensitive and novobiocin-resistant staphylococci were studied comparatively and it was shown that mutations of staphylococci to phenotype Novr resulted in alteration of their pathogenicity, phage lysing and antigenic properties. Loss of phage receptors and a number of antigens as well as changes in multiplication activity of novobiocin resistant staphylococci were defined by alteration of the functional properties and antigenic specificity to teichoic acids. Possible transformation of pathogenic staphylococci into nonpathogenic ones on mutation to Novr is discussed.
