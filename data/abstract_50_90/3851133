Minimum inhibitory (broth microdilution) and bactericidal concentrations determined on 101 oxacillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci against netilmicin, oxacillin, vancomycin, Lauricidin and minoxidil. All isolates were susceptible to vancomycin. Netilmicin was the next most active agent, inhibiting 90% of the strains at 8 mcg/ml.
