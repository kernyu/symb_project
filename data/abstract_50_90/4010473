Evidence is presented which supports the hypothesis that the mode of action, or a slight variant thereof, suggested by Hartman and Hulbert (11) to account for the mutagenic effects of hycanthone (HC) is the mechanism whereby HC exerts its antischistosomal activity. HC is metabolically activated to a reactive ester which, upon dissociation, alkylates DNA. If resistant schistosomes are unaffected because they cannot convert HC to a reactive ester they should be killed upon direct exposure to an appropriately esterified drug. Hycanthone N-methylcarbamate (HNMC) was synthesized and shown to bind to DNA and also alkylate 4-(p-nitrobenzyl)-pyridine. When tested with schistosomes kept in vitro, HNMC caused an irreversible inhibition of 3H-uridine incorporation not only in sensitive S. mansoni (as HC does) but also in HC-resistant and immature S. mansoni worms and S. japonicum worms which are only transiently inhibited by HC. After in vitro contact with HNMC for 1 h both sensitive and resistant schistosomes died in three weeks if either kept in culture or re-transplanted into the host animal. Mice infected with HC-resistant schistosomes showed a drastic worm reduction after in vivo HNMC administration.
