Sixty-three strains of Pseudomonas paucimobilis, a Gram-negative, lemon yellow pigmented, glucose nonfermenting bacillus are phenotypically compared to the type strain of this new species (ATCC 29837). The morphological, cultural, biochemical (ONPG-test, oxidase, aesculin positive) and nutritional (assimilation of many glucides) characteristics and susceptibility or resistance to antimicrobial agents (many antibiotics are active) are reported. The similarities and differences between P. paucimobilis and other yellow pigmented bacteria (Flavobacterium, especially group IIb, Xanthomonas, Pseudomonas maltophilia, stutzeri and cepacia) are presented. The occurrence of P. paucimobilis in diverse aquatic and aqueous sources and hospital environments and its significance in medical bacteriology (many isolates from blood cultures) are discussed.
