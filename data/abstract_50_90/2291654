Gram-positive glycopeptide-resistant bacteria isolated in various hospitals in Europe and in the United States between 1986 and 1988 were collected. Three resistance phenotypes could be distinguished. Thirty-one enterococci were highly resistant to vancomycin and teicoplanin. Resistance was transferable to other enterococci by conjugation for 16 of the 22 isolates that were tested. Homology was detected by hybridization between a probe specific for the vanA gene, which encodes an inducible high-level glycopeptide resistance protein in Enterococcus faecium BM4147, and DNA of the 31 clinical isolates and the 16 corresponding transconjugants. This indicates that a single class of resistance determinants accounts for high-level glycopeptide resistance in enterococci. The strains differed in their biotypes and resistance phenotypes and harbored resistance plasmids of various sizes, suggesting that spread of this resistance phenotype is due to dissemination of a gene rather than of a bacterial clone or of a single plasmid. Four enterococcal isolates were resistant to low levels of vancomycin and susceptible to teicoplanin. Twenty-three coagulase-negative staphylococcal isolates were resistant to teicoplanin and susceptible to vancomycin. These two groups of strains did not hybridize with the vanA probe and did not transfer resistance at a detectable frequency. The vanA gene was not detected in the glycopeptide-producing strains of Amycolatopsis orientalis (vancomycin) and Actinoplanes teichomyceticus (teicoplanin) or in various gram-positive bacteria intrinsically resistant to glycopeptides.
