Ceftriaxone (Ro 13-9904, CTRX) was evaluated for its safety and efficacy in 33 children with various bacterial infections including 10 cases of bacterial meningitis. CTRX was effective in all but 1 case who had acute mucositis due to a resistant strain of Enterobacter cloacae. The serum half-life (T1/2 beta) was 4.5 +/- 1.6 hours after an intravenous bolus injection in children. Cerebrospinal fluid levels of CTRX in the acute phase of bacterial meningitis were 7.69 +/- 4.75 mcg/ml. The only side effect was mild to moderate diarrhea observed in 10 of the 33 cases, but in no case was it necessary to discontinue the drug.
