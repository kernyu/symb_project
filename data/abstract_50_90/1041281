We determined the drug susceptibility of Serratia-Enterobacter group isolated from clinical materials between October 1973 and May 1974 by disk method and agar plate dilution method, and compared the drug susceptibility and multiple resistance among pigment-producing Serratia, pigment non-producing Serratia and Enterobacter. We used following drugs for susceptibility tests; ampicillin, carbenicillin, sulbenicillin, cephaloridine, streptomycin, kanamycin, dibekacin, gentamicin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, colistin, nalidixic acid, nitrofurantoin and erythromycin. Above one half of strains of Serratia and Enterobacter was isolated from sputa and pharyngeal swabs. Almost all strains of Serratia and Enterobacter wer resistant to ampicillin, cephaloridine and erythromycin, but sensitive to gentamicin and dibekacin. Resistant strains were more found in Serratia than in Enterobacter. Pigment non-producing strains of Serratia were more sesistant to chemotherapeutics than pigment producing strains. There were many multiple resistant strains in Serratia and Enterobacter, especially in pigment non-producing strains of Serratia, and the strains isolated from urine were resistant to more drugs compared with the strains from other materials.
