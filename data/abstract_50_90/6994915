A single, intraportal injection of ethanol (0.01 g/kg body weight) in the pentobarbital anesthetized dog elicited an immediate rise in the hepatic resistance to both portal and hepatic blood flows. Similar effects were produced by norepinephrine and these, as well as those of ethanol, were significantly reduced by yohimbine. Increased levels of noradrenaline were found in hepatic venous effluent during the vasoconstriction period induced by ethanol. We postulate that noradrenaline liberated from sympathetic nervous endings of the liver may be involved in vascular response to ethanol.
