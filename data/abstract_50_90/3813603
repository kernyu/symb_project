A 32-year-old man with systemic lupus erythematosus controlled by steroid therapy developed multifocal cutaneous abscesses caused by Mycobacterium scrofulaceum. The distribution and evolution of the lesions suggested hematogenous dissemination, but he exhibited no pulmonary or other visceral manifestations of systemic mycobacterial disease. The patient completed nine months of therapy with isoniazid and rifampin, and the lesions resolved within five months of presentation.
