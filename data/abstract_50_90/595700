Among the approved antimycotic remedies for the general treatment nystatin and amphotericin B of the group of polyenes, griseofulvin (benzofuran), 5-fluorocytosine (antimetabolite) as well as clotrimazol and micomazol (imidazol derivatives) may be mentioned. The preparation 5-fluorocytosine (ancotil) is a valuable enlargement of the hitherto used sortiment of antimycotics. It does not only supersede the hitherto approved orally effective, not absorbed preparations nystatin and clotrimazol as well as the resorbable griseofulvin and also not the intravenously applicable amphotericin B. In many cases it can substitute the more effective amphotericin B and has the essential advantage of the lacking or more insignificant side effects, respectively, compared with the loaded in this respect amphotericin B. On account of the danger of the development of resistance 5-fluorocytosine is to be avoided for local treatment.
