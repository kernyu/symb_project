The type II penicillinase (oxacillin-hydrolyzing beta-lactamase, OXA-1) gene on plasmid Rms213 was transposed to various plasmids or to the host chromosome. The transposon bearing this gene, designated Tn2011, conferred resistance to ampicillin, streptomycin, sulfonamide, and mercuric chloride. By restriction endonuclease digestion and agarose gel electrophoresis, the molecular weight of Tn2011 was estimated to be 12.5 X 10(6). The transposition frequency of Tn2011 was about 10(-4) to 10(-5). The activity of type II penicillinase is related to the copy number of the replicon bearing Tn2011.
