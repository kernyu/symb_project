Laboratory-acquired infections concern all microbiologists. During ongoing surveillance of laboratory-acquired enteric infections, salmonella infections in the wife and son of a laboratory worker were documented; the first case was fatal. Neither patient had had any contact with the laboratory. The infecting organisms were Salmonella typhi and a multiply resistant strain of Salmonella agona that were being worked within the laboratory; both strains had been received 1 to 2 years previously for proficiency testing exercises. This report documents the transmission of enteric pathogens beyond the confines of the laboratory, with its tragic outcome, and suggests measures to prevent the recurrence of this problem.
