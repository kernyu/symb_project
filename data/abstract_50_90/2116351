A 2.5 kb plasmid, pA22, isolated from a naturally occurring S. aureus strain confers constitutive MLS-resistance. By restriction enzyme analysis, pA22 is indistinguishable from the S. aureus inducible MLS-resistance conferring plasmid, pT48, apart froma small deletion. DNA sequencing showed that the deletion, is in the leader/attenuator region of the ermC (MLS-resistance) gene and removes some of the complementary repeat regions required by the translational attenuation model in pT48 for inducible ermC expression. The deletion in plasmid pA22 is different from that found in similar 2.5kb constitutive MLS-resistance plasmids in other Gram-positive bacteria. It is suggested that plasmids conferring the constitutive phenotype have evolved from an inducible ancestor on several independent occasions.
