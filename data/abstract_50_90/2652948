Pasteurella haemolytica-cultures, isolated from cattle with respiratory diseases, were investigated for their biotype, serotype, antimicrobial resistance and plasmid content. A plasmid encoding a beta-lactamase could be demonstrated in 9 of 19 Pasteurella haemolytica-cultures. These 9 cultures, all belonging to biotype A and serotype 1, were resistant to ampicillin, carbenicillin, penicillin G and ticarcillin. The plasmid of the respective cultures proved to be identical upon Southern blot hybridization. It could be transformed into Escherichia coli 490 A where it expressed again a beta-lactamase-activity.
