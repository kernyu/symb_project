An 8.5-megadalton plasmid coding for sulfonamide resistance was found in a clinical isolate of Neisseria meningitidis, as demonstrated by plasmid elimination and transformation experiments. The plasmid complemented a mutation which determines the production of a thermosensitive dihydropteroate synthetase in Escherichia coli, thus suggesting that the mechanism of resistance involved a plasmid-encoded dihydropteroate synthetase.
