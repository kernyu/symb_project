In vitro and in vivo tests were carried out to study the inhibitory effect of mixtures of sodium orthophenylphenate, methyl-1-(butyl-carbamoyl)-2-benzimidazole ('Benomyl') and sodium orthophenylphenate, 2-(4-thiazolil)-benzimidazole ('Thiabendazole') on growth of strains of Penicillium italicum and P. digitatum resistant to sodium orthophenylphenate, 'Benomyl' and 'Thiabendazole'. 'In vitro' tests showed a synergistic effect of the mixtures; 10 ppm of sodium orthophenylphenate and 10 ppm of the benzimidazolic compound in most cases resulted in complete growth inhibition. Navel oranges inoculated with P. italicum spores showed no damage after 7 days of incubation at 25 degrees C and 80-90% relative humidity when treated with a mixture of 100 ppm of sodium orthophenylphenate and 100 ppm of Thiabendazole.
