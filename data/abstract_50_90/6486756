The structure of the causative agents isolated from patients with pyoinflammatory infections in 1980-1983 was analysed. It was shown that the surgical and urological infections were mainly caused by gram-negative bacteria. The other pyoinflammatory infections were mainly due to gram-positive cocci. A relatively high frequency of the strains of gram-negative bacteria, especially among Pseudomonas spp. and Enterobacter spp., resistant to aminoglycoside antibiotics, such as gentamicin, sisomycin and tobramycin with preserved sensitivity to amikacin and netilmicin in the majority of the strains was shown. Among the beta-lactam antibiotics cephotaxim and cephalotin were most active against gram-negative bacteria and staphylococci, respectively. The majority of the antibiotic resistant strains of gram-negative bacteria had analogous structures and levels of resistance to 7-12 antibiotics which might indicate the occurrence of 1-2 resistance plasmids among the clinical strains.
