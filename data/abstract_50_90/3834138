Penetration of aztreonam (AZT) into the uterus and the adnexal tissues and usefulness and safety of AZT for obstetric and gynecologic infections were studied with the following results. By one shot intravenous injection of AZT 1 g, the uterus and the adnexal tissues showed favorable penetration with Cmax 27.0-48.5 micrograms/g, AUC 29.4-84.9 micrograms X hr/g and Tmax 0.10-0.44 hours. MIC50, MIC80 and MIC90 of AZT for Gram-negative bacteria measured prior to administration were very low being 0.10 micrograms/ml, 0.20 micrograms/ml and 1.56 micrograms/ml, respectively. Clinical effect of AZT for 30 infection cases in obstetrics and gynecology was evaluated according to an overall efficacy criteria resulting in "good" for all the cases. With regard to microbiological effect, 90.9% of the pathogens isolated prior to the administration were eliminated by AZT. During and after the administration of AZT, side effect due seemingly to AZT was not observed in subjective and objective symptoms and laboratory values.
