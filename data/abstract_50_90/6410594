We have used the forward mutation to resistance to 6 azauracil to test the mutagenicity of rivanol (6,9 diamino 2-ethoxy acridine) on Escherichia coli. Rivanol has been used to induce therapeutic abortions in midpregnancy and is considered safe and effective for this purpose. The findings reported here that rivanol, like other acridines, is a mutagen, at least in procaryotes, suggests that such use of rivanol be reconsidered in light of its possible genetic toxicity.
