Rhizobium trifolii strains differing in cell and colony morphology, streptomycin resistance, phage sensitivity pattern and infectivity to clover plants produced bacteriocins sensitive to proteases. Elimination of bacteriocin production ability wtih SDS and rifampicin treatment indicates that this feature is plasmid controlled. Elimination of bacteriocinogenic plasmid did not influence other features of R. trifolii.
