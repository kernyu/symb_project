28 non-pregnant women were treated with conventional doses of sulphasomidine or sulphalene for acute urinary tract infections caused by Escherichia coli. Both preparations were found to be effective in simple cystitis infection with sulphonamide-sensitive organisms. Also, both were found to exert a selective pressure favouring sulphonamide-resistant E. coli in the faecal flora.
