The pattern of somatic segregation of the cytoplasmic factors confering resistances to chloramphenicol, erythromycin and oligomyin in S. cerevisiae was studied. The fractions of the zygotes heterozygous for the chloramphenicol-resistance factor and for the erythromycin-resistance factor decreased exponentially with generation number of zygotes. The rate of the segregation was highest for the chloramphenicol-resistance factor and lowest for the oligomycin-resistance factor. The segregation rate as well as the transmission polarity of the chloramphenicol-resistance factor varied with different carbon sources with which the parental haploids were grown prior to mating.
