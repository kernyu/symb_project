Clinical isolates of Providencia and Proteus with relative aminoglycoside resistance were tested for susceptibility to combinations of gentamicin or tobramycin with cephalothin or cefazolin. The minimal bactericidal concentration of aminoglycoside for one-third of the strains was reduced by fourfold or more in the presence of one-fourth of the minimal bactericidal concentration of either cephalosporin. This effect was achieved by clinically attainable concentrations of cephalothin or cefazolin.
