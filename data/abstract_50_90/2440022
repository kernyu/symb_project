Escherichia coli K-12 mutants that carry deletions in their genes for ornithine decarboxylase (L-ornithine carboxy-lyase, EC 4.1.1.17) (speC), arginine decarboxylase (L-arginine carboxy-lyase, EC 4.1.1.19) (speA), and agmatine ureohydrolase (agmatinase or agmatine amidinohydrolase, EC 3.5.3.11) (speB) can still synthesize very small amounts of putrescine and spermidine. The putrescine concentration in these mutants was found to be 1/2500th that in spe+ cells. The pathway of putrescine synthesis appears to be through the biodegradative arginine decarboxylase, which converts arginine to agmatine, in combination with a low agmatine ureohydrolase activity--1/2000th that in spe+ strains. These results suggest that even such low levels of polyamines permit a low level of protein synthesis. Evidence is presented that the polyamine requirement for the growth of the polyamine-dependent speAB, speC deletion mutants, which are also streptomycin resistant, is not due to a decreased ability to synthesize polyamines.
