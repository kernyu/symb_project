Using actinomycin-producing and nonproducing strains of Streptomyces antibioticus, I studied several steps in the biosynthetic pathway of this antibiotic. Actinomycin-nonproducing strains derived after acriflavine or novobiocin treatment showed activity of kynurenine formamidase and phenoxazinone synthase as high as that of the parental strain, but these nonproducing strains failed to convert 4-methyl-3-hydroxy-anthranilic acid to actinomycin. In addition, accumulation of 4-methyl-3-hydroxyanthranilic acid (in the presence of D-valine) was not detected in the nonproducing isolates. Actinomycin-nonproducing strains derived after acriflavine treatment of Streptomyces parvulus showed a drastic decrease of resistance to the antibiotic. However these strains regained resistance after preincubation with a small amount of actinomycin D.
