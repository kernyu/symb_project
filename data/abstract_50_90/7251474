A new broad spectrum semisynthetic cephalosporin (CN-92,982) was prepared from the condensation of an acetylaminoacylaminophenyl pyridone with trans-7-[(D-2-phenylglycyl) amino]-3-[[(1-methyl-1H-tetrazol-5-yl)thio]methyl]-delta 3-cephem-4-carboxylic acid. The new cephalosporin displayed an in vitro antibacterial spectrum similar to other cephaloglycine types such as cefoperazone and SM-1652. The compound produced a high and prolonged blood level following a single intramuscular dose in a dog.
