The mutagenic potency of the simple reversible intercalators isopropyl-OPC (iPr-OPC) and 9-aminoacridine (9-AA) is assessed in E. coli using reversion assays based on plasmids derived from pBR322 carrying various frameshift mutations within the tetracycline resistance gene in repetitive sequences: +/- 2 frameshift mutations within alternating GC sequences; +/- 1 frameshift mutation at runs of guanines. The results obtained show that iPr-OPC and 9-AA have a sequence specificity for mutagenesis: they revert +1 and -1 frameshift mutations within runs of monotonous G:C base pairs. The precise determination of the size of a small restriction fragment which contains the mutation allowed us to demonstrate that reversion occurred by -1 deletions for the +1 frameshift mutations and by +1 additions for the -1 frameshift mutations. The possible relations of this specific reversion with the base sequence specificity of the mutagenesis are briefly discussed.
