1. The growth of the lactoperoxidase-sensitive Streptococcus cremoris 972 in a synthetic medium was inhibited by lactoperoxidase and thiocyanate. The glycolysis and oxygen uptake of suspensions of Strep. cremoris 972 in glucose or lactose were also inhibited. The lactoperoxidase-resistant Strep. cremoris 803 was not inhibited under these conditions but was inhibited in the absence of a source of energy. 2. Lactoperoxidase (EC 1.11.1.7), thiocyanate and hydrogen peroxide completely inhibited the hexokinases of non-metabolizing suspensions of both strains. The inhibition was reversible, hexokinase and glycolytic activities of Strep. cremoris 972 being restored by washing the cells free from inhibitor. The aldolase and 6-phosphogluconate-dehydrogenase activities of Strep. cremoris 972 were partially inhibited but several other enzymes were unaffected. 3. The resistance of Strep. cremoris 803 to inhibition was not due to the lack of hydrogen peroxide formation, to the destruction of peroxide, to the inactivation of lactoperoxidase or to the operation of alternative pathways of carbohydrate metabolism. 4. A ;reversal factor', which was partially purified from extracts of Strep. cremoris 803, reversed the inhibition of glycolysis of Strep. cremoris 972. The ;reversal factor' also catalysed the oxidation of NADH(2) in the presence of an intermediate oxidation product of thiocyanate and was therefore termed the NADH(2)-oxidizing enzyme. 5. The NADH(2)-oxidizing enzyme was present in lactoperoxidase-resistant streptococci but was absent from lactoperoxidase-sensitive streptococci.
