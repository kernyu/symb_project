In Escherichia coli K-12, the conversion of glycerol to triose phosphate is regulated by two types of control mechanism: the rate of synthesis of glycerol kinase and the feedback inhibition of its activity by fructose-1,6-diphosphate. A strain which has lost both control mechanisms by successive mutations, resulting in the constitutive synthesis of a glycerol kinase no longer sensitive to feedback inhibition, can produce a bactericidal factor from glycerol. This toxic factor has been identified by chemical and enzymological tests as methylglyoxal. Methylglyoxal can be derived from dihydroxyacetone phosphate through the action of an enzyme which is present at high constitutive levels in the extracts of the mutant as well as that of the wild-type strain. Nine spontaneous mutants resistant to 1 mm exogenous methylglyoxal have been isolated. In all cases the resistance is associated with increased levels of a glutathione-dependent enzymatic activity for the removal of methylglyoxal. Methylglyoxal-resistant mutants derived from the glycerol-sensitive parental strain also became immune to glycerol.
