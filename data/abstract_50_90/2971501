In a prospective survey of 283 Neisseria gonorrhoeae isolated in St. Paul, Minnesota, 5% were found to produce beta-lactamase, and 11% were resistant to penicillin by chromosomal mediation, thus indicating a hyperendemic level of resistance according to Centers for Disease Control guidelines. A significant level of chromosomal resistance (30%) was noted for tetracycline, and MICs for spectinomycin approached the upper limits of susceptibility for a large number of isolates. The need for uniformity in agar dilution test methodology is discussed, and the variability in antimicrobial agent interpretive breakpoint criteria is illustrated by comparing penicillin breakpoints published by the Centers for Disease Control with those of the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards as applied to the study isolates.
