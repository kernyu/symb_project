Mutant cell lines resistant to hydroxyurea (HU), an inhibitor of the enzyme ribonucleotide reductase, were selected from a line of Syrian hamster melanoma cells. Mutant lines were selected for resistance to 0.3 mM HU, and from these lines, second-step mutants were selected for resistance to 1.9 mM HU. The HUr lines were tested ffor their responses to 5-bromodeoxyuridine (brdU), in terms of toxicity, mutagenesis, and incorporation of BrdU into DNA. All of the HUr lines showed increased resistance to the toxic effects of BrdU. in addition, the HUr lines all were resistant to BrdU mutagenesis. Overall, there was good correlation among the levels of resistance to HU toxicity, BrdU toxicity, and BrdU mutagenesis in the HUr lines. These tests were carried out under conditions such that the parental and HUr cells incorporated equal amounts of BrdU into nuclear DNA. Therefore, the resistance of the HUr cells to the effects of BrdU cannot be attributed to decreased incorporation of BrdU into DNA. These results suggest that the HUr cells have an lateration in ribonucleotide reductase activity that simultaneously confers resistance to HU and BrdU. The properties of the HUr cells suggest that the perturbation of deoxcytidine metabolism by BrdU. The properties of the HUr cells suggest that the perturbation of deoxcytidine metabolism by BrdU triphosphate inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase activity plays a key role in the toxic and mutagenic effects of BrdU in mammalian cells.
