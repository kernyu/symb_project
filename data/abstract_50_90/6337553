The distribution of resistance to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, sulfonamides, tetracycline, and streptomycin among fecal coliforms in sewage, surface waters, and sea water was investigated. The incidence of resistant strains among isolates varied significantly among the water samples, without obvious connection with the water source or the level of pollution. The average frequency of multiple resistance was not always high in the same samples in which the overall resistance was high. The species composition varied considerably in different water samples. A significant correlation was observed between the relative frequency of Klebsiella species and the incidence of ampicillin resistance in water samples. The importance of species composition of fecal coliforms, affected by their source and by the aquatic environment, on the resistance pattern is noted.
