A genetic analysis of representative methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) being isolated in London and Dublin hospitals has demonstrated that the epidemic strains from two London hospitals are different from the Dublin strains, but indistinguishable from the epidemic strains of eastern Australia. The possibility that some strains of MRSA are more likely than others to spread within hospitals is discussed.
