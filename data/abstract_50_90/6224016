Strains of propionibacteria resistant to clindamycin or clindamycin and erythromycin were isolated from four patients with acne, three of whom were receiving clindamycin. Four strains of P. acnes and one of P. granulosum with moderate levels of tetracycline resistance were isolated from 25 patients with acne being treated with tetracycline. A similar increase in tetracycline resistance was achieved by training sensitive strains in vitro. P. acnes was sensitive to sulphonamide and trimethoprim but some strains of P. granulosum were resistant to sulphonamide. Similar reports of clindamycin and erythromycin resistance from the USA suggest resistance may be increasing in isolates from patients with acne.
