The effects of alcohol on insulin action are not yet clearly established. To assess the effects of intravenously administered ethanol on insulin mediated glucose disposal, euglycaemic clamps at 3 different plasma insulin levels and insulin receptor binding studies on circulating monocytes after alcohol infusion were performed. Ethanol infusion leads to a significant reduction of insulin mediated glucose disposal (7.08 +/- 0.4 vs 8.6 +/- 0.6 mg/Kg/min; 9.8 +/- 0.7 vs 13.4 +/- 0.7; 14.7 +/- 0.7 vs 18.1 +/- 0.7 at 33, 73 and 760 mU/m2/min insulin infusion rate respectively). Monocyte insulin-receptor binding was decreased in all the subjects from 30 to 60% after ethanol infusion. These results demonstrate that alcohol can adversely influence the insulin mediated glucose disposal.
