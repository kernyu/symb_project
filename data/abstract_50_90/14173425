A new strain of Staphylococcus aureus, implicated in severe "hospital-acquired" infections, has been recognized and identified. This strain is characterized by lysis with a recently isolated bacteriophage, UC-18. Resistance to penicillin, streptomycin, and tetracycline combined with widespread prevalence in the hospital environment make S. aureus UC-18 a significant contributor to endemic staphylcoccal disease in hospitals.
