A functional and physical analysis of the multicopy plasmid NTP16 is presented. The plasmid-encoded drug resistance determinants are located, as are regions encoding the origin of replication, incompatibility functions, copy number determinants, and mobility functions. It is demonstrated that NTP16 probably arose from the closely related plasmid NTP1 by the acquisition of a novel kanamycin resistance transposon, Tn4352, followed by deletion of some NTP1 sequences. The incompatibility behavior of NTP16 derivatives indicates a system of control rather more complex than that which operates in ColE1. In addition to the RNA I/primer RNA system, the production of a further trans-acting product is demonstrated and its site of action located. A series of derivative plasmids have been created which may prove useful as vectors for genetic engineering.
