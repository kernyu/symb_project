Trimethoprim resistance was plasmid-encoded in all trimethoprim-resistant Salmonella typhimurium and in the majority of trimethoprim-resistant salmonellas of other serotypes isolated since 1970 from humans and food animals in Britain. In S. typhimurium, non-autotransferring plasmids of compatibility group 3 and autotransferring plasmids of group H2 predominated. The predominance of these plasmid types has resulted from the spread of clones of trimethoprim-resistant strains of phage types 18, 170 and 204c. In other salmonellas, a variety of plasmid compatibility groups have been identified. Almost all plasmids which conferred resistance to trimethoprim also coded for sulphonamide resistance.
