Treatment of the strains of E. coli K12 with the mutagen N-nitroso-N-methylurea yielded mutants with the morphology similar to that of stable penicillin L-forms. Studies of the biological properties of the cultures have shown that the mutation of the gen 11r increases the susceptibility to antibiotics of various action spectra, ionic and non-ionic detergents and the resistance to UV and gamma radiation. Biochemical analysis of peptidoglycan from the cell walls of the parent bacterial cultures and L-mutants revealed no differences in its chemical composition.
