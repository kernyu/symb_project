Strains of Gram-positive, catalase-positive, coagulase-negative cocci isolated from urine specimens were classified by the system of Baird-Parker (1963). Urinary infections attributed to instrumentation or pathological abnormalities of the urinary tract were caused almost entirely by various Staphylococcus subgroups. These showed a wide range of antibiotic sensitivities, unrelated to subgroups and not obviously related to previous chemotherapy. Attacks of cystitis occurring in otherwise healthy women were usually caused by Micrococcus subgroup 3 strains.
