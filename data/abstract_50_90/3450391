The susceptibility of 120 strains of several species of anaerobes to a number of second and third generation beta-lactam antibiotics was determined by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards reference agar dilution and microdilution methods. The antibiotics tested were cefoperazone, cefotaxime, cefotetan, ceftizoxime, cefoxitin, and imipenem. The MIC50s ranged from 0.125 to 16 micrograms/ml. The MIC90s were lowest with imipenem at 0.5 micrograms/ml, followed by cefoxitin at 32 micrograms/ml; they were highest with cefotetan at 128 micrograms/ml and were 64 micrograms/ml with the others. In vitro drug activity varied with the antibiotic, the organism, the method used, and the breakpoint selected. Rates of resistance varied considerably between the taxonomic groups of organisms tested and also among species within a group. Overall, reproducibility with the agar dilution method ranged from 44% to 85%; testing with ceftizoxime was the least reproducible. Microdilution results agreed within +/- 1 dilution of the agar dilution mode 79% to 95% of the time, with some variation between drugs and organisms tested. Because there were distinct differences in the activity of some drugs against certain species, no antibiotic can substitute for others in in vitro testing.
