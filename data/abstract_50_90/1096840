Treatment with flucytosine of 20 patients with fungal infections gave favorable results in four patients with crytococcal infections, two of four patients with disseminated candidiasis, eight of ten patients with urinary tract infections due to Candida albicans and Torulopsis glabrata, and tow of three patients with miscellaneous infections due to Calbicans. Two patients with crytococcal meningitis and altered host resistance and one patient with an aorto femoral graft infection due to C albicans were treated with flucytosine and smphotericin B. The infection was eradicated in one of the patients with meningitis, and cultures from an infected arterial graft became negative. Adverse side effects of flucytosine included mild leukopenia and thrombocytopenia, a transient increase in alkaline phosphatase and glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase, and nausea and diarrhea.
