Methicillin (intrinsic) resistance of Staphylococcus aureus was suppressed almost completely by regulatory gene (penI(1)) mutations of penicillinase plasmids that made penicillinase production strictly noninducible. Methicillin resistance was restored by secondary regulatory gene mutations that altered the noninducible phenotype or by complementation with a compatible plasmid that did not bear the noninducible mutation. No evidence was obtained for genetic linkage between a penicillinase plasmid and the gene for methicillin resistance. We suggest, therefore, that the mutant noninducible repressor acted in trans by binding to a site on the methicillin resistance determinant. This hypothesis would imply an appreciable degree of homology between penicillinase plasmids and methicillin resistance genes.
