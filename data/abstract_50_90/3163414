Opportunistic mycotic infections have a significant influence on the morbidity and mortality of children whose immune systems are depressed by the onset of AML. The present paper assesses the incidence of the pathogenic mycotic flora and the in vitro efficacy of the main antimycotic drugs. Candida was che most commonly encountered pathogen and its in vitro response to the polyenic antibiotics was good.
