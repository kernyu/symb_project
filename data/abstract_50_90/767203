The mitochondrial mutation of the resistance to tetracycline (Tr) is shown to have one-parent inheritance. The polarity of recombination between the gene Tr and other mitochondrial mutations also depends on the alleles controlling the mating type as well as in another nuclear gene i, suppressing Tr-resistance. The "arrest" of Tr-transmission in alpha-haploid or in a haploid with gene-suppressor induces the process of mitochondrial recombination.
