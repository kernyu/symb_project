1. Cytochrome b-562 is more reduced in submitochondrial particles of mutant 28 during the aerobic steady-state respiration with succinate than in particles of the wild type. When anaerobiosis is reached, the reduction of cytochrome b is preceded by a rapid reoxidation in the mutnat. A similar reoxidation is observed in the wild type in the present of low concentrations of antimycin. 2. In contrast to the wild type, inhibition of electron transport in the mutant has a much higher antimycin titre than effects on cytochromes b (viz., aerobic steady-state reduction; reduction in the presence of substrate, cyanide and oxygen; the 'red shift' and lowering of E'-o of cytochrome b-562). Moreover, the titration curve of electron transport is hyperbolic whereas the curves for the reduction are sigmoidal. The conclusion is, that in both mutant and wild type, the actions of antimycin on electron transport and cytochromes b are separable. 3. The red shift in the mutant is more extensive than in the wild type. 4. Cytochrome b-558 and cytochrome b-566 (that absorbs in mutant and wild type at 564.5 nm) do not respond simultaneously to addition of antimycin, indicating that they are two separate cytochromes. 5. The difference between the effect of antimycin on electron transport and cytochromes b reduction is also found in intact cells of the mutant. 6. A model is suggested for the wild-type respiratory chain in which (i) the cytochromes b lie, in an uncoupled system, out of the main electron-transfer chain, (ii) antimycin induces a conformation change in QH-2-cytochrome c reductase resulting in effects on cytochrome b and inhibition of electron transport, (iii) a second antimycin-binding site with low affinity to the antibiotic is present, capable of inhibiting electron transport.
