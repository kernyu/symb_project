The effect of ceftizoxime, a new aminothiazolil-syn-methoxy-iminocephalosporin has been evaluated on 169 strains of Gram negative bacilli isolated from hospitalized patients and compared with that of cefotaxime and of ceftriaxone. The effect of these 3 cephalosporins and of cefalotin was also evaluated on 50 strains of staphylococcus. CIM50 of ceftizoximel was as follows: K. pneumoniae less than .032, aureus and S. epidermidis less than .2 CIM90 for the same species was: K. pneumoniae less than .25, E. coli less than .63, E. Cloacae and S. marcescens less than 8, S. aureus less than 32, S. epidermidis less than 16. The values obtained with cefotaxime and ceftriaxone were similar. Cefalotin was clearly more active on staphylococcus strains with CIM50 and CIM90 for both species of less than .25 and less than .2 respectively.
