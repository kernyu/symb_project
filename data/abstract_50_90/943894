2894 salmonella strains received from veterinary laboratories in the Federal Republic of Germany including Berlin (West) in 1973 were examined for their resistance against tetracyclines, ampicillin, chloramphenicol, kanamycin, nitrofurazone, and furazolidone. 24.4% of the strains studied were found to be resistant to one or more of these antibacterial substances. The proportion of resistant strains was 63.9% for S. typhimurium (excluding var. copenhagen), 6.5% for S. typhimurium var. copenhagen and 51% for S. panama. 81.3% of resistant strains were found to belong to these types. From 708 resistant strains found, resistance determinants were present in 92.9% to tetracyclines in 27.9% to ampicillin, in 22.0% to chloramphenicol, in 13.6% to kanamycin, in 1.4% to furazolidone, and in 1.7% to nitrofurazone. 20 combinations of resistance determinants were found to occur 90.9% of strains transmitted resistance to E. coli K-12. A transmission of resistance determinants to furazolidone and nitrofurazone could not be demonstrated. As in the preceding years, there was a clear difference of resistance patterns from one serotype to another.
