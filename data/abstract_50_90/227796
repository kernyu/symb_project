Mixed preparations of fibroblast and immune interferons interacted with cells synergistically to cause the development of a much greater level of protection than expected on the basis of their separate activities. This increased level of protection was 5- to 20-fold greater than expected on the basis of a simple additive effect of the interferons. The potentiating factor copurified with both fibroblast interferon and immune interferon as they were partially purified. The potentiation was not an artifact of a more rapid development of immune interferon-induced antiviral resistance in the presence of fibroblast interferon. The results were consistent with the hypothesis that fibroblast and immune interferons mutually potentiate each other, thus supporting the supposition that they have different modes of action.
