28 patients suffering from a variety of bacterial infections have been treated with cefuroxime. 18 were cured and 6 improved during treatment. Side effects were minimal and intramuscular injection was well tolerated. Serum and urine levels well in excess of the MICs of sensitive organisms were obtained using dosages of 750 mg 8 hourly. Biliary excretion was impaired in the presence of obstruction, but adequate bile levels of cefuroxime were observed following relief of the obstruction. Cefuroxime was widely active against gram-negative bacilli and against Streptococcus faecalis, but less active against Bacteroides spp.
