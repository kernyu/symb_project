Twenty-six wild-type Streptomyces strains tested for resistance to arsenate, arsenite and antimony(III) could be divided into four groups: those resistant only to arsenite (3) or to arsenate (2) and those resistant (8) or sensitive (13) to both heavy metals. All strains were sensitive to antimony. The structural genes for the ars operon of Escherichia coli were subcloned into various Streptomyces plasmid vectors. The expression of the whole ars operon in streptomycetes may be strain-specific and occurred only from low-copy-number plasmids. The arsC gene product could be expressed from high-copy plasmids and conferred arsenate resistance to both E. coli and Streptomyces species. The ars operon expressed in S. lividans and the arsC gene expressed in S. noursei did not render the synthesis of undecylprodigiosin and nourseothricin, respectively, phosphate-resistant. In addition in wild-type strains of Streptomyces phosphate sensitivity of antibiotic biosynthesis did not show strong correlation with resistance of growth to arsenicals.
