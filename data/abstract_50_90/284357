Emr-2 is an emetine-resistant (Emr) Chinese hamster ovary cell mutant that contains a single electrophoretically altered ribosomal protein, a component of its 40S ribosomal subunit [Boersma, D., McGill, S., Mollenkamp, J. & Roufa, D.J. (1979) J. Biol. Chem. 254, in press]. This report describes a genetic experiment designed to test linkage between the genes that specify the altered ribosomal protein, S20*, and emetine resistance in Emr clones that segregated from cultures of Emr-2 cells hybridized with emetine-sensitive cells. The data described indicate that Emr and S20* phenotypes are due to mutations linked to the same chromosome in the Chinese hamster genome; most likely they are due to the same mutation. The data also confirm earlier speculations by others that the Emr locus in Chinese hamster cells is hemizygous.
