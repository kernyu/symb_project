1. When growing Mycobacterium tuberculosis BCG was exposed to 0.5-10mug. of isoniazid/ml. there was intracellular accumulation of soluble carbohydrate, combined phosphate and substances absorbing at 260mmu. Yellow pigments were formed when modified Sauton medium was used, but not with Proskauer & Beck medium. These processes were apparent after 1hr. but were more marked after about 6hr. These effects were not found with an isoniazid-resistant strain. 2. After 6hr. exposure of the sensitive strain to 10mug./ml. there was little change in the amounts (per g. of insoluble nitrogen) of total lipid, glycolipid, RNA, DNA or of carbohydrate in the nucleic acid fractions. 3. The major accumulation was of alphaalpha'-trehalose. There was also accumulation of glucose 6-phosphate, glucose 1-phosphate, fructose 6-phosphate, trehalose 6-phosphate (tentatively identified), a polysaccharide containing only glucose, and an oligosaccharide containing glucose and glucose 6-phosphate, but not of glycerol and glycerol 3-phosphate. The u.v.-absorbing materials appeared to be nucleotide sugar derivatives. 4. In Mycobacterium smegmatis a similar accumulation of trehalose occurred on exposure to isoniazid, but there was little accumulation of other compounds. 5. No evidence could be found that isoniazid specifically affected the oxidation of glycerol or glycerol 3-phosphate. 6. It is suggested that the primary action of isoniazid on mycobacteria may be partial inhibition of a reaction in some central area of metabolism, such as glycolysis.
