Enterococci that persisted in debrided, medicated root canals were tested by the Kirby-Bauer procedure for sensitivity to various antibiotics. The 50 strains tested were uniformly sensitive to ampicillin and vancomycin. More than 90% were also sensitive to erythromycin. Varying degrees of sensitivity and resistance were noted to bacitracin, cephaloridine, cephalothin, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, and tetracycline. All organisms were either partly or wholly resistant to clindamycin; penicillin; streptomycin; and sulfadiazine, sulfamerazine, and sulfamethazine (triple sulfas).
