In a mutation experiment with a rough, ampicillin-resistant strain of Escherichia coli K-12, two smooth ampicillin-sensitive mutants were isolated. One of the mutants (with the envA gene) was recently described. The second mutant (strain D23) with the envB gene which has been mapped to a position close to streptomycin resistance (strA) at 64 min is described. The envB gene gives rise to spherelike cells. Electron microscopy revealed an abnormal septum formation and a circular distribution of the nuclear material. Strain D23 (with envB) showed a changed resistance to several antibiotics as well as an increased tolerance to ultraviolet irradiation. The envB gene decreased the ampicillin resistance mediated by the ampA gene (at 82 min), but no effect was found on episomally mediated penicillin resistance.
