Comparative study of the meningococcus sensitivity of various serological groups with different localization in the human organism to the antagonistic activity of normal microbes of the nasopharynx and the antibiotics it was found that strains isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid of patients suffering from cerebrospinal meningitis, chiefly of serological group A, had the greatest resistance to the antagonists. Taking into consideration the leading epidemiological role of the cultures belonging to the serological group A in the USSR, it can be supposed that meningococcus sensitivity to the nasopharyngeal antagonists was of significance for the manifestation of their pathogenic properties. No association of the antibiotic sensitivity of the same strains with reference to a definite serological group or the site of the microbe localization was revealed.
