The eradication of malaria remains an elusive goal in many tropical and subtropical countries, even though methods are available that, if used correctly, will permit control of the disease in most area. These methods include chemotherapy directed against the parasite in the human host and such antivector techniques as a reduction of mosquito breeding sites and an attack on the aquatic and adult stages of mosquitoes. The direction of a malaria control program requires a detailed understanding of malaria epidemiology and control measures as well as flexibility in their application to different epidemiologic situations. In most developing countries, the success of a malaria control effort will depend on a well-functioning primary health care system and active community participation in control activities.
