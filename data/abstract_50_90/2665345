This study reports of 191 infections that occurred after 14807 primary clean operations from 1982 to 1986. The spectrum of organism and the resistancy of bacteria has been analysed. 5 groups of organisms (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcen, Enterococcen and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) are responsible for 82% of the infections. 88% of the bacteria in monoinfections were sensitive to Cefazedon. The development of resistancy against this type of Cefalosporin could not be seen.
