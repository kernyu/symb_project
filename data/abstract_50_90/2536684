A methicillin-susceptible, novobiocin-resistant strain of Staphylococcus aureus (RN2677; methicillin MIC, 0.8 micrograms/ml) was transformed with DNA prepared from highly and homogeneously methicillin-resistant S. aureus strains (methicillin MIC, greater than or equal to 400 micrograms/ml) or from heterogeneous strains in which the majority of cells had a low level of resistance (methicillin MIC, 6.3 micrograms/ml). All methicillin-resistant transformants showed low and heterogeneous resistance (methicillin MIC, 3.1 micrograms/ml) irrespective of the resistance level of DNA donors. All transformants examined produced normal amounts of the low-affinity penicillin-binding protein (PBP) 2a, and methicillin resistance and the capacity to produce PBP 2a showed the same degree of genetic linkage to the novobiocin resistance marker with both homogeneous and heterogeneous DNA donors. Next, we isolated a methicillin-susceptible mutant from a highly and homogeneously resistant strain which had a Tn551 insertion near or within the PBP 2a gene and thus did not produce PBP 2a. With this mutant used as the recipient, genetic transformation of the methicillin resistance gene was repeated with DNA isolated either from highly and homogeneously resistant strains or from heterogeneous (low-resistance) strains. All transformants obtained expressed high and homogeneous resistance and produced PBP 2a irrespective of the resistance level of the DNA donors. Our findings suggest that (i) the methicillin resistance locus is identical to the structural gene for PBP 2a, (ii) although the ability to produce PBP 2a is essential for resistance, the MICs for the majority of cells are not related to the cellular concentration of PBP 2a, and (iii) high MICs and homogeneous expression of resistance require the products of other distinct genetic elements as well.
