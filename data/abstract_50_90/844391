The antibacterial effects of Sepso-tincture, Kodan, Dibromol, and 70% ethanol as disinfectants were compared on the skin of 34 patients of the first surgical department of the general hospital in Hamburg-Barmbek. Special attention was paid to the regeneration of microorganisms in relation to time. The result was that the tested substances showed an almost equal effect after 2 min. However, after 10, and 60 min the tests showed considerable divergencies. In comparison, therefore, with the other substances, it could be proved that the least regeneration of microorganisms was observed after application of Sepso-tincture (significance after 10 min: P less than 0.01, after 60 min: P less than 0.05).
