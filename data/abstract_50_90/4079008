Transfer of cefpiramide (SM-1652, CPM) to female genital organs was studied. CPM concentration was determined in the uterine artery, portio vaginalis, myometrium, ovary and oviduct of patients undergoing hysterectomy, and in the pelvic dead space exudate of patients undergoing radical hysterectomy due to uterocervical cancer. Data obtained were analyzed by three-compartment model. The maximum concentration at 1 hour after intravenous drip infusion of CPM in a dose of 1 g were 244.31 micrograms/ml in both the uterine arterial serum and uterine venous serum, 31.41 micrograms/g in the portio vaginalis, 32.99 micrograms/g in the myometrium, 31.67 micrograms/g in the ovary and 31.99 micrograms/g in the oviduct. The concentration in the pelvic dead space exudate reached to the maximum level of 5.32 micrograms/ml at 5.84 hours and thereafter decreased slowly. The clinical effect of CPM was examined in 6 patients with various female genital infections and found to be effective in all cases. Side effects and abnormal laboratory finding values were not observed at all.
