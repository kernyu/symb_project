The effects of several physical and chemical agents on the survival of Trichophyton mentagrophytes arthrospores were investigated. Although arthrospores of this dermatophyte were highly resistant to chilling and freezing, they were extremely susceptible to moderate heat (above 50 degrees C) and desiccation. This high susceptibility could be significantly reduced when they were dried in the presence of exogenous proteins. These arthrospores were markedly susceptible to glutaraldehyde. They appeared to be significantly more resistant than their hyphal counterparts to common antimycotics such as clotrimazole, griseofulvin, miconazole nitrate, and nystatin. Clinical and epidemiological implications of these observations are discussed.
