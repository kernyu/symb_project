The antimicrobial susceptibilities of 100 methicillin=resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains were concurrently determined by the Abbott MS-2 System and by the standard disk diffusion method. Agreement between the two methods was 94% or greater for all of the antibiotics tested except for methicillin and gentamicin. This study indicates that the Abbott MS-2 cannot be relied upon for detection of methicillin resistance in clinical S. aureus isolates.
