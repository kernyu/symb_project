We have been studying the antagonistic activity of the Streptoverticillium griseocarneum, strain IA-7527. It produces a strong antifungal substance which we named griseocarnin. Its antimicrobial power to Neurospora crassa, Rhodotorula, rubra, Hansenula suaveolens and Candida albicans deserves to be exceled. The isolated substance was compared with other antifungal antibiotics presenting close similarity with the heptaens Ascosin and PA-150. The production, extraction and purification methods as well as physical, chemical and biological properties are included in this work.
