A successful kinetic approach to the screening of preservation efficacy of benzylalcohol--a neutral-type preservative--is described. The D-value, activation energy (Ea), temperature coefficient (Q10) and concentration exponent (n) were used as parameters in determining the influence of different factors on the efficacy of benzylalcohol. Factors, such as the pH of the solution, temperature and concentration of the preservative were investigated. The study was carried out using five micro-organisms: Aspergillus niger, Candida albicans, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus.
