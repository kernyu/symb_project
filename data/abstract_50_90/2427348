This study describes the isolation and characterization of epithelial cell lines that maintain their differentiated phenotype following the stable integration of SV40 genes. Epithelial cells were derived from a defined location of rabbit kidney, the thick ascending limb of Henle's loop, and were co-transfected with genes from the early region of SV40 together with pSV2-neo DNA (which confers resistance to the antibiotic G418). These cells were shown to be resistant to G418, express SV40 large T-antigen and continued to express differentiated characteristics typical of cells of their origin. Such characteristics include the expression of high levels of activity of both Na,K-ATPase and the functionally important Na,K,Cl-co-transport system, the synthesis of Tamm-Horsfall glycoprotein and the presence of a barium-sensitive K+ channel on the apical membrane surface.
