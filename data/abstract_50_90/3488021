LY 164846, a new oral cephalosporin, demonstrated very good inhibitory and bactericidal activities against Haemophilus influenzae irrespective of the production of beta-lactamase by the test strains. However, its activity was not markedly superior to that of either Augmentin (amoxicillin plus clavulanate) or cefaclor.
