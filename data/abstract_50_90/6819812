Sensitivity of sisomicin was studied with respect to the causative agents of surgical infections. The microbial species belonging to the following genera were tested: Staphylococcus, Klebsiella, Escherichia, Proteus and Pseudomonas. The comparative studies with amykacin, tobramycin and other aminoglycoside antibiotics showed that sisomicin had the highest activity against Staphylococci, Klebsiella, Proteus and Ps. aeruginosa. Its activity against E. coli was equal to that of gentamicin and tobramycin. The percentage of the strains resistant to sisomicin was lower than that of the strains resistant to the other aminoglycoside antibiotics except amykacin.
