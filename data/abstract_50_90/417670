SCE-129 [3-(4-carbamoyl-1-pyridiniomethyl)-7beta-(d-alpha-sulfophenylacetamido)-ceph-3-em -4-carboxylate monosodium salt], a new semisynthetic cephalosporin, shows potent in vitro antibacterial activities against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and some gram-positive bacteria, whereas it shows lower activity against many gram-negative rods. Against clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa this cephalosporin exhibited higher activity than did carbenicillin, and against the strains of Staphylococcus aureus, SCE-129 had similar activity to carbenicillin. Variations in pH, addition of horse serum, and type of growth medium had no significant effects on the activity of the cephalosporin; however, the inoculum size had some effect on the activity. SCE-129 is an effective bactericidal agent against P. aeruginosa and S. aureus. The protective effects of SCE-129 in mice infected with P. aeruginosa and S. aureus were more potent than those of carbenicillin. The protective effects of SCE-129 on Pseudomonas infection in mice varied according to the dosage schedule and the challenge dose. In a multiple dose schedule, a smaller amount of SCE-129 was necessary than that in a single dose schedule. The effects of SCE-129 after subcutaneous or intraperitoneal administration were more potent than were those by intravenous administration. No protective effect was observed by oral administration.
