The Minimal Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) and Minimal Bactericidal Concentration (MBC) of 31 strains of Staphylococcus aureus resistant to methicillin and gentamicin were determined towards aminoglycosides: netilmicin (N) and amikacin (A). The results of the study showed a large discordance between the technic using dilution in Mueller-Hinton broth and the technic using agar diffusion with antibiotic discs. The level of sensitivity appears to decrease by dilution. The problem of using these aminoglycosides in combination with other antibiotics as fosfomycin (F) and pefloxacin (P) was faced. In vitro, antibacterial activity of combinations [N-F], [N-P] and [A-F], [A-P], was studied by microtiter checkerboard method. The antibacterial effects of these combinations were evaluated by determination of Fractional Bactericidal Indices (FBC-indices). The combination netilmicin or amikacin with pefloxacin has an additive bactericidal effect in most cases, without discrimination between the different aminoglycosides (FBC #0.82). Netilmicin or amikacin in combination with fosfomycin are found to be additive or moderately synergistic (FBC #0.53). No occurrence of antagonism was observed.
