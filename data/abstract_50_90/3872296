One hundred and sixty-nine blood and cerebrospinal fluid isolates of Haemophilus influenzae, collected in the Province of Ontario from children and adults from 1976 to 1983, were tested for susceptibility to six conventional and eight newer antibacterial drugs. Most active were ceftriaxone, ceftizoxime and cefotaxime (MIC90 less than or equal to 0.02 mg/l); latamoxef (moxalactam), acrosoxacin and ceftazidime were close behind with MIC90s in the 0.05-0.09 mg/l range. Twenty-five strains (14.8%) were beta-lactamase-producing and thus resistant to ampicillin. There were no chloramphenicol-resistant strains. The isolates showed intermediate but still clinically useful susceptibility to trimethoprim, rifampicin, cefuroxime, piperacillin and chloramphenicol and were least susceptible to gentamicin and sulphamethoxazole.
