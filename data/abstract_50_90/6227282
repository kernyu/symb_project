The glycopeptide antibiotic teichomycin had in vitro activity comparable to that of vancomycin against most gram-positive species, and it inhibited methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. It was twofold more active against many S. aureus and S. epidermidis isolates than was vancomycin. Teichomycin had activity comparable to that of vancomycin against Listeria monocytogenes and Streptococcus faecalis. It was generally more active against streptococci than was vancomycin. There were no major differences between minimal inhibitory concentrations and minimal bactericidal concentrations of these drugs. Teichomycin acted synergistically with gentamicin against some bacteria.
