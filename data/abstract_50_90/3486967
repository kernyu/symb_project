Thirty-five patients with meningitis caused by Haemophilus influenzae type b were admitted to our hospital from January 1981 to December 1984; 60% of the strains were resistant to ampicillin, 65.7% to chloramphenicol, and 57% to both antibiotics. No significant differences in age, sex, previous treatment, clinical symptoms, outcome, and mortality were found between the 20 patients whose strains were resistant to both ampicillin and chloramphenicol and the other 15 patients whose strains were susceptible to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, or both. Alternative therapeutic agents were a combination of carbenicillin and gentamicin and new cephalosporins. At present, cefotaxime is our treatment of choice for meningitis caused by H. influenzae type b.
