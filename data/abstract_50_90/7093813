Twenty-five strains of Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis isolated from lesions of caseous lymphadenitis in goats were examined for their biochemical characteristics, antimicrobial susceptibility, and phospholipase D activity. The strains were uniform in biochemical reactions, cultural characteristics, and susceptibility to antimicrobial agents. Presence of urease and phospholipase D and absence of pyrazinamidase were valuable criteria in the identification of C. pseudotuberculosis.
