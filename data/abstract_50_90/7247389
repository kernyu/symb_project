Eight new beta-lactam antibiotics and rosaramicin were tested for their activity against penicillin-susceptible and multiply resistant pneumococci. All of the beta-lactam drugs were 50- to 150-fold less active against the drug-resistant pneumococci when compared with their activity against penicillin-susceptible pneumococci. Rosaramicin activity was similar to that of erythromycin.
