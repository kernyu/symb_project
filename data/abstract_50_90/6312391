Bacterial meningitis caused by Haemophilus influenzae observed from 1976 to 1980 (10 cases) are compared with those observed in 1981 (9 cases). From 1976 to 1980, 9 strains (90%) are ampicillin-sensitive. In 1981, 5 strains (55,5%) are ampicillin-sensitive and 4 strains (45,5%) are ampicillin-resistant and betalactamase positive. These 9 strains are serotype b. Therefore, since 1981, initial treatment of bacterial meningitis in infancy is a new cephalosporin, in this study is cefotaxime.
