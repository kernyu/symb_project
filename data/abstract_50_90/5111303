Tests were performed on 64 strains of Pseudomonas pseudomallei to compare rifampin, various tetracyclines, and other antibiotics for inhibitory activity in vitro. Rifampin minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values generally fell between 25 to 50 mug/ml. For deoxycycline, methacycline, tetracycline, and minocycline, MIC means ranged from 1.3 to 2.7 mug/ml. Delayed treatment tests in subacute mouse infections revealed a better rifampin activity than was expected from its weak activity in vitro, whereas of the others, minocycline appeared superior. None of these five antibiotics demonstrated fully curative effectiveness in terms of mouse survival or eradication of residual infection in organs.
