Plasmid DNA screening experiments were conducted to determine whether a relationship existed between the presence of plasmids and antibiotic resistance in Pasteurella haemolytica or the capability to produce hemolysin or leukotoxin (cytotoxin). Regardless of plasmid content, all P haemolytica isolates produced characteristic hemolysis on blood agar plates. Similarly, standardized suspensions of living bacteria and sterile concentrated (approx 200:1) culture supernatant from strains representing each of the 15 recognized P haemolytica serotypes and 7 field strains of P haemolytica (biotype A, serotype 1) produced leukotoxin, which was detected by their capability to cause inhibition of the luminol-dependent chemiluminescence response of bovine neutrophils. However, neither living bacterial suspensions nor concentrated culture supernatant from 4 untypable P haemolytica strains or a P multocida strain caused an inhibition of the luminol-dependent chemiluminescence response. The production of neither hemolysin nor leukotoxin by P haemolytica seemed to be plasmid mediated. Leukotoxin production is apparently a stable phenotypic characteristic of pathogenic P haemolytica strains, and the gene(s) coding for this activity is probably located on the bacterial host chromosome. Antibiotic susceptibility profiles were determined for the different bacterial strains. Studies of ampicillin and penicillin resistance in 8 P haemolytica (biotype A, serotype 1) strains provided evidence that the plasmid, with size of approximately 5,200 base pairs, may code for their resistance to these compounds.
