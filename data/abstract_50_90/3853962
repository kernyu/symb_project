Penicillin-binding protein (PBP) 5 of Streptococcus faecium has been shown to have a very low affinity for penicillin, and this PBP was suggested to be responsible for both the natural low susceptibility and high resistance to the antibiotic in this species (R. Fontana, R. Cerini, P. Longoni, A. Grossato, and P. Canepari, J. Bacteriol. 155:1343-1350, 1983). In this study, an S. faecium mutant (Rev 14) hypersusceptible to penicillin was derived from the highly resistant S. faecium R40 treated with novobiocin, and its properties were compared with those of the parent and S. faecium PS, a relatively susceptible strain from which R40 was isolated. The hypersusceptible strain did not synthesize PBP 5, but it did resemble the parent in cell morphology, growth rate, and autolytic activity. In addition, it was highly susceptible to other beta-lactams but remained as susceptible as R40 and PS to antibiotics of a different mechanisms of action. The affinity of individual PBPs for the beta-lactams tested was the same in all the strains. This finding suggested that Rev 14 hypersusceptibility was due to the lack of PBP 5 and strongly supported the role of this protein in the mechanism of both natural low susceptibility and high-level resistance to beta-lactams in S. faecium.
