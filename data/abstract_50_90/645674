Five children with intraventricular shunts developed ventriculitis due to organisms resistant to multiple antimicrobial agents but sensitive to gentamicin sulfate. No gentamicin was detected in ventricular CSF of four patients at a time when gentamicin was being administered only intravenously. The intraventricular administration of 1 mg of gentamicin resulted in ventricular CSF concentrations greater than 20 microgram/ml one hour and 5 to 14 microgram/ml 36 hours after administration. Patients were treated with intraventricularly given gentamicin for an average of 16 days, with no apparent complications or relapses during the 12- to 24-month follow-up period. Intraventricularly administered gentamicin sulfate (1 mg every 24 to 36 hours) in conjunction with complete shunt removal was an effective means of therapy of ventriculitis caused by bacteria resistant to antibiotics that readily penetrate the blood-brain barrier.
