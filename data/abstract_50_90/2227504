The major results of studies on the assessment of the dynamic activity of sorption--filtering respirators relative to mercury vapours are presented. It has been shown that the term for the storage of the respirator "Lepestok-G" can be increased from 6 months, starting from the date of production--according to the established technical rules, --up to 2 years. The surface density of the sorbent can be reduced from 3.5 down to 1.5 mg/sm2, which will make it possible to significantly reduce the initial resistance to breathing and to improve the operational and protective properties of the respirator.
