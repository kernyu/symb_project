The MICs for 41 Neisseria gonorrhoeae strains from patients receiving spectinomycin treatment were determined by the agar dilution method and compared with the zones of inhibition produced by disks containing 100 micrograms of spectinomycin. Our data demonstrated a good correlation between the two methods. Moreover, a zone of inhibition of less than or equal to 15 mm was a good predictor of clinical treatment failures with spectinomycin.
