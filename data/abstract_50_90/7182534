Investigation was made on the effectiveness and safety of amikacin (AMK) in the treatment of bacterial infections and prevention of postoperative infections in the orthopedic field. The details of 14 infectious patients treated with AMK were as follows; osteomyelitis in 5, purulent arthritis in 3, decubitius in 3, cystitis in 2 and purulent peritonitis in 1. For prevention of postoperative infections, AMK was administered to 9 patients. In 14 infectious patients, clinical response was excellent in 2, good in 11 and poor in 1, while in 9 postoperative patients clinical response was excellent or good in all of them. As side effects, a slight rise of the GOT and GPT levels was observed in 1 but normalized by discontinuation of the medication. In the aspects of effectiveness and safety, AMK may be considered to be a useful available antibiotic in the orthopedic field.
