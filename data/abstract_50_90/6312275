The mechanism of resistance of Mycobacterium intracellulare strain 103 and other clinical isolates to a variety of drugs including aminoglycoside and peptide antibiotics was investigated. Enzymatic inactivation of aminoglycoside and peptide antibiotics could not be demonstrated. Ribosomes of the strain were found to be sensitive to the antibiotics. The levels of resistance of strain 103 and other clinical isolates decreased dramatically when the culture medium was changed from Dubos agar to Tween 80-containing agar. These results suggest that a permeability barrier is the reason for naturally occurring resistance in M. intracellulare.
