Treatment of Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium cells with a low dose of hydrogen peroxide induces expression of a large number of genes, and confers resistance to oxidative stresses. The oxyR gene encodes a positive regulatory protein for a subset of these genes involved in the defense against oxidative damage. We cloned a DNA fragment that contains the E. coli oxyR region on a plasmid vector, and analyzed the nucleotide sequence of the gene. The amino acid sequence of OxyR protein, deduced from the nucleotide sequence, shows a high degree of homology to the sequences of a number of bacterial activator proteins including LysR, CysB, IlvY, MetR and NodD. The product of the oxyR gene identified by the maxicell procedure was a 34 kDa protein, which agrees with the size predicted from the nucleotide sequence of the gene.
