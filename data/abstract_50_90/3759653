A bacterial isolate from soil, designated as TB-2125 had a unique pattern of multiple resistance to aminoglycoside antibiotics (AG) and produced new nucleoside antibiotics. Taxonomic properties of this strain fell into those of Bacillus circulans, providing unique characteristics such as strict susceptibility to acidic pH, motility of colony as well as multiple AG-resistance. Two new antibiotics which were named bagougeramines A and B had a broad antimicrobial activity and a specific activity against the two spotted spider mite.
