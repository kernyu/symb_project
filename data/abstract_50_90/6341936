Several methods used for the detection of beta-lactamase activity in Haemophilus influenzae are described. The rapid iodemetric, acidimetric, and chromogenic cephalosporin techniques are specific tests for the presence of beta-lactamase. The Gots test can also be used for the detection of enzymatic resistance to ampicillin and chloramphenicol.
