Forty-two antibiotic resistance plasmids and twelve metabolic plasmids have been transferred to a strain of Shigella sonnei. The phage-typing modifications have been investigated after transfer of the different above described plasmids. Eleven of the R plasmids and five of the metabolic plasmids affect phage sensitivity. These modifications are not specific for any compatibility group.
