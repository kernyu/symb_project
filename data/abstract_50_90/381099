239 nistatin-resistant mutants were selected after UV-irradiation of yeasts. Phenotypical analysis has revealed two main groups of the mutants: 1) resistant to nistatin and resistant or sensitive (in different combinations) to haptaens; 2) resistant to nistatin and having an increased resistance to haptens. It is found that the sensitivity dominates over the resistance and hyper-resistance. Genetic analysis of the mutant collection has shown that the resistance to nistatin is determined by 5 nuclear genes (hysr). Hyper-resistance is controlled by mutations in other genes, which are not connected with stable phenotype. Genes of hyper-resistance can be considered as minus-modificators of pleiothrophic cross-resistance, characteristic of hysr genes. Plus-modificator genes of polyenic resistance are described. The gene hysr1 is linked with its chromosome.
