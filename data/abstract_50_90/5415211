The death rate kinetics of several sporeforming and nonsporeforming microorganisms, including radiation-resistant cocci, were determined by exposing them to a mixture of ethylene oxide and dichlorodifluoromethane (500 mg of ethylene oxide per liter, 30 to 50% relative humidity, and 54.4 C). Spore survivor curves obtained from tests of inoculated and exposed hygroscopic and nonhygroscopic carriers showed that the spores of Bacillus subtilis var. niger are more resistant to ethylene oxide than are spores of Clostridium sporogenes, B. stearothermophilus, and B. pumilus. The decimal reduction times (expressed as D values at 54.4 C-500 mg of ethylene oxide per liter) obtained under the test conditions for B. subtilis var. niger spores on hygroscopic and nonhygroscopic carriers exceeded the values obtained for the other organisms considered, both sporeformers and nonsporeformers. The decimal reduction times for the vegetative cells of the radiation-resistant organisms (Micrococcus radiodurans and two strains of Streptococcus faecalis) and the ATCC strain of S. faecalis demonstrated comparable resistance to ethylene oxide with the spores of C. sporogenes, B. stearothermophilus, and B. pumilus, but not those of B. subtilis var. niger.
