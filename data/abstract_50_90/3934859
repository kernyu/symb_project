Several failures of gonorrhea treatment due to neisseria producing penicillinase (PPNG), resistance against other antibiotics, side effects like allergies, gastrointestinal problems, and other factors are the reasons for continuing trials with new drugs in the treatment of gonorrhea. With regard to modern aminoglycosides, the development of early resistance has not been observed so far. Especially with Netilmicin, no such disadvantages have been reported in the literature. Therefore a single dose schedule was introduced with Netilmicin given to 600 patients suffering from uncomplicated gonorrhea in order to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the drug. 300 mg Netilmicin were administered intramuscularly in a one shot therapy. With all patients, the diagnosis had been confirmed by culture. The efficacy of therapy was controlled by a second culture, which proved to be negative in all 600 cases. Gonorrhea was also clinically cured in all patients.
