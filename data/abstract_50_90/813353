In 1974, the State veterinary institutes in the Slovak Socialist Republic studied the sensitivity of 4420 strains of Streptococcus agalactiae and 1056 strains of Staphylococcus aureus to eight antibiotics. The strains were isolated from milk samples obtained from dairy cows suffering from mastitis. 100 per cent of the strains of Streptococcus agalactiae was sensitive to ampicillin, 99.23% to erythromycin, 98.70% to oxytetracycline, 93.02% to bacitracin, 90.77% to chloramphenicol, 41.97% to penicillin, 12.39% to neomycin, 9.73% to streptomycin. As to the strains of Staphylococcus aureus, 98.68 were sensitive to chloramphenicol, 98.50% to ampicillin, 97.92% to erythromycin, 94.98% to oxytetracycline, 93.85% to neomycin, 92.67% to bacitracin 87.50% to streptomycin, and 46.24% to penicillin. The results are discussed in relation to the use of antibiotics in the treatment of mastitis in dairy cows.
