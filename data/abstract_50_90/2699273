Since a few years, malaria has reappeared in the Central Highland Plateaux of Madagascar. From 1983 to 1987, Plasmodium falciparum resistance to chloroquine remained stable, with a low frequency of R2 therapeutic failures. In 1988, a study was conducted in the village of Manarintsoa, 15 km from Tananarive. Ninety-one WHO in vivo standard tests were performed. In vitro efficacy of amodiaquine and quinine was also studied. In vitro, the efficacy of chloroquine, quinine, and mefloquine was measured against 104, 64, and 23 P. falciparum isolates, respectively, by an isotopic semi-microtest.
