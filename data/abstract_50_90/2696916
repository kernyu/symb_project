A strain of Haemonchus contortus from the Pietermaritzburg district of Natal was found to be resistant to levamisole (geometric mean efficacy 76.5%), morantel (41.9%), the benzimidazoles (oxfendazole: 33.7%) and rafoxanide (82.0%), but apparently fully susceptible to closantel and disophenol. In the case of ivermectin, a mean of 5.2% of the H. contortus was not removed at a dosage of 200 micrograms kg-1 live mass. A second strain of H. contortus, from Amsterdam in the south-eastern Transvaal, showed reduced susceptibility to levamisole (80.8%) and morantel (46.2%), the only 2 drugs tested. This is apparently the first report of resistance to the levamisole/morantel group of anthelmintics in sheep in South Africa.
