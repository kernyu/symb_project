Amantadine has been accepted for both the treatment and prophylaxis of influenza A virus infections. Although amantadine-resistant mutants have been shown to be readily generated both in the laboratory and in children treated with rimantadine, little is known about their biologic properties, such as genetic stability, transmissibility, or pathogenicity, compared with the parental virus. This study examined these properties using an avian influenza virus, A/chicken/Pennsylvania/1370/83 (H5N2). Variants that were amantadine-resistant, virulent, and capable of competing with wild-type virus for transmission to susceptible hosts in the absence of the drug were selected. These amantadine-resistant variants were also genetically stable, showing no reversion to wild-type after six passages in birds over a period of greater than 20 d. Thus, these virus variants had no detectable biologic impairment. The mutations conferring drug resistance were in the M2 polypeptide and were identical to mutations previously described in human amantadine-resistant virus. These results suggest that resistant mutants may have the potential to threaten the effective use of amantadine and rimantadine for the control of epidemic influenza.
