A new method for isolating specialized transducing phages is described. It was used to isolate a group of phi80 transducing phages which carry various bacterial markers from the metB region of the Escherichia coli chromosome. Some of the phages selected for transduction of the supA36 marker were also shown to carry rif, a locus known to specify the beta subunit of ribonucleic acid polymerase. Expression of the prophage rif(r) gene in lysogens was demonstrated by its ability to confer rifampin resistance on part of the cellular ribonucleic acid polymerase pool.
