Of 20 clinical isolates of group A, B, G, D (Streptococcus bovis), and viridans streptococci, 5 transferred their antibiotic resistance markers into streptococcal recipients at a low frequency (10(-4) to 10(-8)) in the apparent absence of extrachromosomal elements. All strains carried genetic markers for high-level resistance to streptomycin, kanamycin, neomycin, lividomycin A, and ribostamycin, as well as resistance to macrolides and related drugs, tetracycline, and chloramphenicol.
