The activities of clindamycin and its derivative, pirlimycin (U-57930E), were compared against 100 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, using a microtiter broth dilution technique. Minimal inhibitory concentrations demonstrated that pirlimycin was comparable to clindamycin but offered no increase in activity against either methicillin-susceptible or methicillin-resistant S. aureus.
