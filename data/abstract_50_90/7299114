The state of antimicrobial resistance of the organism of puerperal women and newborn children was studied by determining the number of skin autoflora microbes according to N. N. Klemparskaya and G. A. Shal'nova (1966). A total of 125 puerperal women and 120 newborn were examined during the 5 days of their stay in maternity hospital. A continuous increase in the number of skin autoflora microbes were observed in the newborn. From the 1st to the 5th day, the group of children with a raised concentration of microbes on their skin made up 6.0, 15.7, 24.5, 36.8 and 46.0%, respectively. Among puerperal women, the number of those with a raised concentration of skin autoflora microbes reached its maximum (43.2%) on the 3rd day after delivery. It decreased to 18% by the moment of discharge from maternity hospital. The number of newborn with a high concentration of skin microbes was found to be significantly higher among children who had suffered purulent- inflammatory infections during the first month of life as compared with the group of children who had not fallen ill. The establishment of the number of skin autoflora microbes can serve as a prognostic test for detecting groups of newborn with a higher risk of falling ill with purulent infections.
