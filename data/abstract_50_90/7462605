During a survey in Jakarta, Indonesia, 158 cultures of Salmonella oranienburg, consisting of two phage types, were obtained from 150 hospitalized patients with diarrhoea. Phage type I, though found notably in young children, was found in all age groups while phage type II was found almost exclusively in young children aged 0-7 years. Phage type I may produce a more severe clinical picture affecting all age groups alike, while phage type II may result in hospitalization of only the very young, who are more susceptible to dehydration. Phage type I was significantly more resistant than phage type II to the individual antibiotics: tetracycline, chloramphenicol, kanamycin and neomycin. However, there was no difference in their respective antibiotic resistance patterns as measured by disk and MIC assay. All cultures were sensitive to gentamicin and trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole 1:19.
