Since 1967, more than 2,000 specimens have been examined for the possible existence of Yersinia enterocolitica in Iran. Most of the specimens were stool and appendices. For primary isolation SS and EMB media were used and the cultures were incubated at 37 degrees C. In 1976 we isolated the first strain of Y. enterocolitica from the stool of a 10-month-old girl. She was suffering from chronic diarrhea. This strain was the first strain of Y. enterocolitica to be successfully isolated in Iran. It belongs to serotype 03,--biotype 4-phage type VIII. It has all the classical characteristics of Y. enterocolitica. However, in contrast to the strains found in northern Europe, it ferments d-xylose. Our finding was confirmed by internationally accepted Yersinia centers.
