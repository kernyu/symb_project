The analysis of the genetic organization of the determinant ERLI by means of obtaining and studying the antibiotic sensitive mutants from the strain resistant to erythromycin and lincomycin provided experiment data in favour of the fact that inducable resistance to erythromycin and lincomycin determined by the plasmid might be defined by the same or closely linked genes.
