Tn2653 contains one copy of the tet gene and two copies of the cat gene derived from plasmid pBR325 and is flanked by inverted repeats of IS1. Transposed onto the P1-15 prophage, it confers a chloramphenicol resistance phenotype to the Escherichia coli host. Because the prophage is perpetuated as a plasmid at about one copy per host chromosome, the host cell is still tetracycline sensitive even though P1-15 is carrying one copy of the tet gene. We isolated P1-15::Tn2653 mutants conferring a tetracycline resistance phenotype, in which the whole transposon and variable flanking P1-15 DNA segments were amplified. Amplification was most probably preceded by IS1-mediated DNA rearrangements which led to long direct repeats containing Tn2653 sequences and P1-15 DNA. Subsequent recombination events between these direct repeats led to amplification of a segment containing the tetracycline resistance gene in tandem arrays.
