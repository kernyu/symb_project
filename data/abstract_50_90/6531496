During a 3-year period (1980-1982), 594 pneumococcal strains taken from 565 patients were serotyped. The distribution of the serotypes and their prevalence varied by sample and year. The theoretic vaccinal coverage, evaluated for the four main pathologies: pneumonia, otitis, meningitis, bacteriemia, is 79,1%. Among vaccinal serotypes, the types 19, 7, 3, 6, 1, and 23 are the most frequent, representing a cumulative incidence of 57,7%. In our region (Grenoble), the pneumococcus remains very sensitive to antibiotics. No strain resistant to penicillin G was observed. Erythromycin, doxycyclin, chloramphenicol, and cotrimoxazole preserve their potency with, respectively, 2,1%, 1,8%, 1,1%, and 1,9% resistant strains.
