Zygorhynchus vuilleminii, a nonmelanin-containing fungus, was not lysed by mycolytic actinomycetes. Several enzymes and Streptomyces enzyme preparations digesting walls of other fungi were without appreciable activity on walls of Zygorhynchus species. A bacterium able to solubilize a portion of the Zygorhynchus wall released little or no reducing sugars from these structures. Fractions of Z. vuilleminii walls were resistant to glucanase hydrolysis, but certain fractions were digested by chitinase and microbial enzyme preparations. The walls and several wall fractions were not readily susceptible to degradation by a soil community. Walls of lysis-resistant Zygorhynchus species contained glucosamine, fucose, glucuronic acid, and galactose but little or no glucose. Resistant wall fractions were rich in uronic acid and fucose, whereas the readily degradable fractions contained abundant glucosamine. Cultural conditions affected the extent of digestion and composition of the walls. Possible reasons for the resistance of Zygorhynchus to lysis in nature are discussed.
