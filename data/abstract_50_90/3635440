The authors evaluated the susceptibility of some antibiotics against several Staphylococci subdivided in lyogroups and different resistance patterns: methicillin-susceptible/penicillin-susceptible (MS/PS), methicillin-susceptible/penicillin-resistant (MS/PR), methicillin-resistant/penicillin-resistant (MR/PR) and methicillin-resistant/penicillin-susceptible (MR/PS). The antimicrobial agents used were: methicillin, penicillin, rifampin, tetracycline, lincomycin, erythromycin, gentamicin and netilmicin. Netilmicin showed better activity against all Staphylococcus strains tested, particularly against coagulase-negative.
