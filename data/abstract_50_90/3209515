Fourteen strains of lactobacilli isolated from the rumen of young calves were studied to determine their biochemical characteristics, growth parameters, metabolism on lactose and sensitivity to 28 antimicrobial agents. Thirteen homofermentative strains belonged to Lactobacillus acidophilus and one heterofermentative strain resembled Lact. fermentum. The relevance of rumen lactobacilli to the nutrition of calves is discussed.
