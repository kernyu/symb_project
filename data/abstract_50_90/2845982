An 8.5 kb BamHI DNA fragment conferring resistance to nosiheptide, a peptide antibiotic of the 'thiostrepton group', was cloned from Streptomyces actuosus ATCC 25421 in Streptomyces lividans 1326. Two BamHI fragments of S. actuosus, the 8.5 kb fragment and an additional 3.0 kb fragment, hybridized with a thiostrepton resistance gene probe (pIJ30). The 8.5 kb fragment showed a relatively low degree of homology with the thiostrepton resistance gene. The restriction map of the nosiheptide resistance gene isolated here was significantly different from the map of the thiostrepton resistance gene previously published.
