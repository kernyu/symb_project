Susceptibility of 100 clinical isolates of H. influenzae (84 beta-lactamase non-producing strains and 16 beta-lactamase producing strains) to 5 cephamycin antibiotics was studied in comparison with 3 reference antibiotics. In MIC90 against beta-lactamase non-producing strains, LMOX and ABPC were the most excellent, followed by T-1982, CTT, CTM, CMZ, CFX and CEZ. Against beta-lactamase producing strains, all the cephamycin antibiotics were as active as against beta-lactamase non-producing strains, whereas ABPC was extremely less active with the MIC90 of greater than 100 micrograms/ml. CTM and CEZ were about 1 tube less active than against beta-lactamase non-producing strains. Thus, it was confirmed that the cephamycin antibiotics were stable to beta-lactamase.
