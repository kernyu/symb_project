STUDIES ON ERYTHROMYCIN RESISTANCE IN STRAINS OF GROUP A STREPTOCOCCI INDICATED THAT THEY WERE COMPRISED OF TWO TYPES: (i) an inducible, resistant type (IR strains) was seen, which manifested immediate logarithmic growth in media containing high concentrations of the drug only after brief previous exposure (induction period) of the organisms to subinhibitory concentrations of erythromycin, and (ii) a constitutive, resistant type (CR strains) which demonstrated, without prior drug exposure, continued logarithmic growth in media containing high concentrations of erythromycin. Subinhibitory concentrations of either chloramphenicol or puromycin, when added to IR strains prior to induction, interfered with their induction by erythromycin. Exposure of CR strains to chloramphenicol did not visibly affect the subsequent growth curve of these strains in media containing high concentrations of erythromycin. In IR strains, resistance to other macrolide antibiotics (oleandomycin, spiramycin, carbomycin, magnamycin) and to lincomycin also was inducible in nature. There was cross-inducibility between erythromycin, other macrolide antibiotics, and lincomycin. CR strains were constitutively resistant to these antibiotics.
