A total of 112 Staphylococcus aureus strains resistant to methicillin and gentamicin were collected from 31 centres in 22 countries worldwide. Many strains were multi-resistant. In tests to determine the susceptibility of the organisms to ciprofloxacin 16 strains (14.3%), originating from France, the FRG, Israel and Italy, were shown to be resistant to this agent. To limit ciprofloxacin resistance, a reappraisal is necessary of fluoroquinolone usage against methicillin- and gentamicin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
