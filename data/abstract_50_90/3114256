Agents that inhibit DNA synthesis increase the frequency of methotrexate resistance and gene amplification in cultured mammalian cells. Chinese hamster ovary cells blocked with hydroxyurea rereplicated dihydrofolate reductase gene sequences within a single cell cycle upon release from the block (Mariani, B.D., and Schimke, R.T. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 1901-1910). Perturbation of DNA synthesis was postulated to result in misfiring of replicon initiation, subsequent over-replication of DNA sequences, and amplification of specific genes. To test this hypothesis, we have exposed Chinese hamster ovary cells pulsed with bromodeoxyuridine to three agents that inhibit DNA synthesis and enhance gene amplification: UV irradiation, hydroxyurea, and aphidicolin. After release from the block, the progression of cells throughout the cell cycle was analyzed by flow cytometry through simultaneous measurement of total cellular DNA content and bromodeoxyuridine-labeled DNA. Although the cell cycle effects varied depending on the agent used for the block, in all cases a subset of cells that were in S phase at the time of the block exhibited DNA histograms with greater than 4C DNA content at various times after release and prior to cell division. Cells with the excess DNA were approximately 10-fold more resistant to methotrexate compared to treated cells with normal DNA content or untreated cells. Therefore, cells in S phase at the time of the block produce excess DNA per cell prior to division, and this over-replicated DNA may be relevant to gene amplification and drug resistance.
