In a trial of 2 grams oral single dose of amoxycillin on 70 patients with acute gonococcal urethritis, 64 patients had full bacteriological cure, 4 patients were lost to follow up and presumed cured, two patients, still had gonococcal urethritis one week after treatment but one admitted to re-exposure and subsequently recovered with a second 2 gram single dose of "amoxil". Among 30 patients with non gonococcal Urethritis (N.G.U.) treated similarly, a fairly good response was obtained in those patients in whom Staph. Aureas was absent from the urethral discharge. However single dose therapy was considered unsuitable for non gonococcal urethritis.
