A clonal derivative of a Chinese hamster Don D-6 cell line resistant to methyl methane sulfonate (MMS) has been isolated following mutagenesis by ethyl methane sulfonate (EMS). The clone, designated as MMSr-1, exhibited high resistance to killing by the monofunctional alkylating agents MMS and EMS. This characteristic had not been acquired by a transient adaptation to the alkylating agents but was found to be a stable heritable trait. MMSr-1 was more sensitive to high-molecular-weight chemicals, such as colchicine and puromycin, than Don D-6. Both MMSr-1 and its parental cells showed the same ability to take up radioactive MMS. The resistance of MMSr-1 appears not to be due to altered uptake of MMS. The resistance was accompanied by low chromosomal aberration and sister chromatid exchange (SCE) induction but not by mutability. Protein synthesis inhibitors such as cycloheximide and puromycin reduced the resistance to the same level as that in Don D-6. SCE induction by MMS in this clone was not antagonized by the protein synthesis inhibitors, whereas mutagenesis was reversed to the normal parental cell level by these inhibitors. Aphidicolin, a DNA-synthesis inhibitor, exhibited no such effects. These results suggest that MMSr-1 might have modified repair capacity, which can be normalized by treatment with the protein-synthesis inhibitors, for lethal DNA damage by monofunctional alkylating agents, and that SCE formation by the alkylating agents is closely correlated with chromosomal aberration and cell lethality.
