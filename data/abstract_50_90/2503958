100 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P.a.) from birds and reptiles were compared by determination of their O-serovars and their resistance to chemotherapeutic agents. A great number of isolates (birds 17.4%, reptiles 29.6%) were serologically untypable using 17 O-antisera by slide-agglutination-technique. The prevalence of O-serovar 0:6 was found in birds (39%) and reptiles (18.5%), followed by bird-isolates 0:1 and 0:3 (each 13%) and reptile-isolates 0:16 (14.8%). The serological distribution was different among bird- and reptile-isolates and also among the human and animal strains. All strains were resistant to penicillin G and ampicillin, more than 90% to nitrofurantoin, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, chloramphenicol and erythromycin. Resistance to tetracycline was found to be 87%, resistance to sulfonamide 81%, respectively. 32% of all isolates were resistant to streptomycin, 61% to kanamycin. All isolates were susceptible to genta- and neomycin. Also all isolates, except one reptile-strain, were susceptible to gyrase-blocker (Bay VP 2674). 2 isolates were resistant to polymyxin B.
