The in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility of staphylococci isolated in two different communities, Camiri and Javillo, of the Santa Cruz region in south-eastern Bolivia was tested by the agar diffusion technique and by a micro dilution susceptibility test to determine the Minimum Inhibitory Concentrations. Staphylococcal strains isolated from hospital staff of the Camiri Hospital were compared to that isolated from healthy people of Javillo, a very small community isolated in the jungle. In the Camiri Hospital, staphylococci showed a high prevalence of penicillin resistance, 100% for S. aureus strains and 73.5% for coagulase-negative staphylococci. Among coagulase-negative strains we found a high rate of multiresistant strains, mainly to ampicillin, tetracycline and chloramphenicol. In the rural population of Javillo we found staphylococcal strains highly susceptible to all the antibiotics tested.
