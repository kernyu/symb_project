Since 1979, the Lakes region (Kivu in Zaire, Western Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi) has been stricken by a bacillary dysentery epidemic at S. dysenteriae type 1. Supposed to be extinct since the 1950s., this bacillus has revealed a very noticeable virulence as well by the number of registered cases (524/100.000 in 1983 at Ruhengeri-Rwanda) as its fast break through. Demographic density (from 400 to 600/km2) has played an important role and has facilitated the transition toward epidemicity. Systematic bacteriological exams on the spot has allowed prompt identification of the involved germ, antibiotics to be used, and resistance variations during the period under consideration. The role of a regional laboratory to monitor diarrheal diseases has been demonstrated as of prime importance to set up a fighting strategy at regional level.
