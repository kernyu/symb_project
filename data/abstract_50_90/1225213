Sensitivity to antibiotics and sodium sulfapiridasin of the microorganisms of group OLT, i. e. Halprowia and Chlamidia isolated from the joint fluid and synovial of the affected joints in patients with rheumatoid or non-specific infectious arthritis and Raiter syndrome was studied in ovo. The data provided determination of the spectrum of their sensitivity to various drugs. The antibiotics of the tetracycline group, i. e. olemorphocycline, tetracycline and rondomycin were shown to have the highest inhibitory effect. Penicillin and ampicillin only delayed the death of the infected embryons. As for kanamycin and streptomycin used in the doses tested, the agents were not sensitive to them. The isolates were also resistant to sodium sulfapiridasin which once more confirmed the questionable value of this criterion for differentiation of Halprowia.
