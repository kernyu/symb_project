A review of the literature suggests the following conclusions: 1) since its first practical use in 1965, namely over the past 10 years, there has been no drop in activity of Gentamicin on Staphylococcus aureus and on numerous other Staphylococcus and/or Micrococcus species. 2) In comparison with the other aminoglycosidic antibiotics employed up to the present, i.e. Streptomycin, Neomycin, Kanamycin, Amminosidine, and Framycetin, Gentamicin has demonstrated a much superior antistaphylococcic activity, and this has also been documented on numerous strains of staphylococci recalcitrant to Kanamycin, Streptomycin, Framycetin and Neomycin. This goes to prove the absence of any cross resistance between Kanamycin, Streptomycin, Framycetin and Neomycin on the one hand and Gentamycin on the other. 3) Along with Rifampicin, certain Cephalosporins (Cephalotine, Cephaloridine) and Pristinamycin-Virgimycin, Gentamicin must undoubtedly be considered a "greater" antibiotic as far as antistaphylococcic activity is concerned. It also has the advantage over other antistaphylococcic-acting antibiotics that only in exceptional cases does it give rise to resistant strains.
