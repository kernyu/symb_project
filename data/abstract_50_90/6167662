A human endometrial cancer cell line, HEC-1, was found to be resistant to the antiviral and anticellular action of interferon. However, HEC-1 cells were susceptible to the cytotoxicity of natural killer (NK) cells, and interferon enhanced such NK activity. When HEC-1 cells were treated with interferon, sensitivity of HEC cells to the cytotoxicity of NK cells was not suppressed.
