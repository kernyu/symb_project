Antitoxic effect of lysozyme was shown on a model of experimental acute toxic hepatitis of rats and mice. Administration of lysozyme to the animals in a dose of 5 mg/kg 24 hours before administration of carbon tetrachloride markedly decreased the level of morphological damages in the liver tissue and promoted a decrease in increased levels of alanine aminotransferase in blood serum. Higher levels of lysozyme in blood serum and cells of mouse peritoneal exudate 3 hours after administration of lysozyme were observed. The role of lysozyme as one of the main products secreted by activated macrophages in providing the general and antitoxic resistance of hepatocytes is discussed. Possible use of lysozyme as a hepatoprotective agent is suggested.
