The in vivo sensitivity of Plasmodium falciparum for chloroquine, quinine and pyrimethamine-sulfadoxine has been evaluated in 3 of 14 sentinel antimalarial drugs sensitivity surveillance centres between October 1986 and July 1987. Children of less than five years old were treated with chloroquine at 25 mg/kg dose administered during 3 days, or with 140 mg/kg quinine base administered in a daily dose of 20 mg/kg during 7 consecutive days, or with one standard dose of 1/2 a pyrimethamine-sulfadoxine tablet for children between 3 and 48 months old and 1 tablet for children between 49 and 59 months old, or the combination of 60 mg/kg quinine base at 20 mg/kg single dose during 3 consecutive days with the association pyrimethamine-sulfadoxine in single dose at the first day of treatment. A modified standard 7 days in vivo test of the World Health Organization was used 2, 3 and 7 days after the start of treatment. In one location an additional observation was made on day 14. The results, compared by location and by drug regimen, show a varying but relatively important reduction of the activity of chloroquine on the parasitological level. Quinine in maximal but single dose also shows reduction in activity, especially on day 14 in the Tshela centre. The pyrimethamine-sulfadoxine association shows a better activity. On the clinical level, e.g. temperature remission after treatment, all antimalarials still maintain their activity. As a result, and in view of its persisting high clinical activity, chloroquine at 25 mg/kg dose remains the drug of first choice for the treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum infections.
