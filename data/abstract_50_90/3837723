A survey has been carried out on 336 strains of staphylococci isolated in a hospital environment in order to assess the validity of the lyogroup classifying method, to know their epidemiological behavior in our territory and to test their sensitivity to various antibiotics. The findings of the survey can be summed up as follows: the practical test for bacteriolysis activity appears to be a valid method of identifying staphylococci in so far as it allows to classify them, but also to differentiate them from micrococci; lyogroup VI appears to be prevalent both as a whole and in nearly all materials of origin; the incidence of resistance is highest for piperacillin (47%), gentamicin (20%), tobramycin (19%); it is lowest for netilmicin (1.2%) and amikacin (2.6%); among meticilline resistant strains (18%) there is a marked resistance towards nearly all antibiotics tested.
