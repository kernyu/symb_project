Six hundred and forty eight NAG vibrio strains isolated at various periods from patients and carriers and from environmental objects such as surface of water reservoirs and sewage were studied with respect to their sensitivity to 14 antibiotics with the method of serial dilutions in solid media. Irrespective of the isolation place, object and time, the NAG vibrios were highly resistant to penicillins and polymyxin M. At the same time they were highly sensitive to gentamicin (MIC 1-2 micrograms/ml), levomycetin (MIC 0.5-1 micrograms/ml) and tetracyclines (MIC 0.25-1 micrograms/ml). Study of the recipient capacity of NAG vibrios with respect to R plasmids showed that they could be recipients of exogenic R plasmids of various incompatibility groups.
