Antibiotic resistance of 132 strains of nonfermenting gram-negative bacteria (NGNB) was studied. 43, 20, 17, 14 and 12 of them belonged to Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (anitratus and lwoffi), Pseudomonas cepacia, Alcaligenes faecalis, P. stutzeri and P. maltophilia, respectively. With rare exceptions all the strains were resistant to benzylpenicillin, oxacillin, lincomycin, ampicillin and cephaloridine. Sensitivity to the other antibiotics varied within wide ranges. Amikacin (94.3 per cent) and tobramycin (90.8 per cent), as well as polymyxin, rifampicin and gentamicin (71.7-66.9 per cent) had the highest effect. The majority of the antibiotics had higher activity (p less than 0.01) against the tested NGNB as compared to their activity against P. aeruginosa. Antibioticograms of every of the tested species of NGNB revealed that P. cepacia and P. stutzeri were the most resistant species. The biovars of Acinetobacter varied in their antibiotic resistance: A. subsp. lwoffi was more sensitive to the majority of the antibiotics though some of them, i.e. doxycycline, carbenicillin, and polymyxin were more active against A. subsp. anitratus.
