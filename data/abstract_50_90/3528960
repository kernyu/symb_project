In a multi-institutional study 26 patients with refractory acute myeloid leukemia were entered into a phase I/II study of HD-ara-C and mitox. HD-ara-C 3 g/m2 q 12h was given by 3h infusion on days 1-4. Mitox was started at 12 mg/m2/d on days 3, 4 and 5, and escalated to 4 and 5 doses of 10 mg/m2/d on days 2-5 and 2-6, respectively. From 24 patients presently evaluable for response, 12 achieved a CR and 2 a PR. 7 patients died of infectious complications within the first 4 weeks of treatment while persistent AML was found in 3 cases. Except for one death, possibly related to acute cardiomyopathy, toxicity was mild to moderate consisting of nausea and vomiting, mucositis and diarrhea. These data indicate a high anti-leukemic activity of HD-ara-C/mitox in AML refractory against conventional chemotherapy.
