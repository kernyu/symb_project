The transmissible plasmid pAMbeta1, which codes for erythromycin and lincomycin resistance, was conjugally transferred from a Lancefield group F Streptococcus to a strain of Streptococcus avium. Both organisms served as pAMbeta1 donors for three strains of Lactobacillus casei. Introduction of pAMbeta1 into one of the L. casei strains caused the organism to lose its native 6.7 X 10(6)-dalton plasmid. Loss of the native plasmid produced no alterations in the organism's growth characteristics or fermentation pattern.
