A total of 183 recent Staphylococcus aureus clinical isolates were tested with three commercially available rapid agglutination methods. The capsular polysaccharide type and resistance to oxacillin of these isolates were also determined. Seven isolates were not identified correctly by agglutination methods. All isolates not identified by the rapid methods were of capsular serotype 5, and of these isolates, six were resistant to oxacillin. The results suggest that these agglutination kits can be improved by the use of antibodies reactive with S. aureus capsular polysaccharide.
