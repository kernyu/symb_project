The inhibition of growth of the K-12 strain of Escherichia coli by glycyl-l-leucine observed originally by Simmonds and co-workers was investigated. The inhibition was reversed by isoleucine and those precursors of isoleucine beyond threonine in the biosynthetic pathway. Threonine reversed the inhibition poorly. With heavy cell suspensions, the inhibition was transient: the onset of growth followed the disappearance of the dipeptide from the medium and the appearance of glycine and leucine. Glycyl-leucine was shown to be an inhibitor of threonine deaminase (EC 4.2.1.16 l-threonine hydro-lyase [deaminating]). One kind of glycyl-leucine-resistant mutant had a threonine deaminase that was resistant to isoleucine and glycyl-leucine inhibition. The pattern of glycyl-leucine inhibition is compared with those of inhibition by isoleucine and by the weaker inhibitors leucine and valine.
