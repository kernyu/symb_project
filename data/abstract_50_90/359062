Phagocytic activity of leukocytes, as well as the complement, properdin, and lysozyme levels in the blood serum of miniature piglets, germfree and monocontaminated with E. coli 055 and E. coli 083, were studied. E. coli 055 phagocytosis was decreased in the presence of autologous serum and complement and increased under the effect of specific opsonins (antibodies to E. coli 055). Complement, properdin, and lysozyme levels were decreased in the germfree, in comparison with conventional animals. In the E. coli contaminated piglets properdin and complement production was stimulated most, and lysozyme formation--less. No antibodies to E. coli 055 were revealed in monocontaminated piglets. The highest lysozyme levels were found in the ex-germfree animals, this indicating the participation of factors other than E. coli contamination in lysozyme stimulation. It is concluded that microbial contamination played an important role in the development of cellular and humoral factors of the organism resistance.
