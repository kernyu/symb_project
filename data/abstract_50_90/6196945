Studies on the induction of histidase were made with normal and nitrofurantoin resistant strains of Vibrio el tor. Nitrofurantoin resistant strains showed decreased level of induction in comparison to normal Vibrio el tor. The effect of different inhibitors like actinomycin D, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, nitrofurantoin and rifampicin on histidase induction was also studied. The mechanism of inhibition caused by the antibiotics is discussed.
