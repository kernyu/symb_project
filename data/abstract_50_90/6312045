Several nucleosides modified and chain extended at the 5'-position have been synthesized as follows: N6-benzamido- 9-(2,3-di-O-benzoyl-beta-D-arabino-pentodialdo-1,4-furanosyl)adenine, O=CHR, a leads to (E)-EtOCOCH=CHR (2) b leads to EtOCOCH2CH2R (3) c leads to H2NCOCH2CH2R (6) d leads to 1-(adenin-9- yl)-1,5,6-trideoxy-beta-D-arabino-hepto-1,4-furanuronamide (8); 3 e leads to ethyl 1-(adenin-9-yl)-1,5,6-trideoxy-beta-D-arabino-hepto-1, 4-furanuronate (5) f leads to 1-(adenin-9-yl)-1, 5,6-trideoxy-beta-D-arabino-hepto-1,4-furanuronic acid (4); 5 g leads to 9-(5,6-dideoxy-beta-D-arabino-hepto-1,4-furanosyl)adenine (7) [where a = EtOCOCH=PPh3; b = H2, Pd/C; c = Me2A1NH2; d = NH3/MeOH; e = NaOEt/EtOH; f = NaOH/MeOH; g = LiA1H4]. Both 7 and 8 show activity against herpes simplex virus type 1. The mechanism for such activity is unknown. Compounds 5 and 8 exhibited weak coronary vasodilation effects in dogs.
