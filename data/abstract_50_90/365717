Massive bacterial populations are frequently involved in infection. Such dense cultures may appear 'resistant' to therapeutically achievable concentrations of some antibacterial agents in vitro, but the implications of this for treatment are not always clear. A better understanding of the mechanisms responsible for inoculum effects may help in assessing their clinical significance and some possible approaches to this goal are described.
