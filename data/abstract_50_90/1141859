Pea plants were inoculated jointly with pairs of genetically marked strains of Rhizobium leguminosarum. Out of 297 modules examined 56 contained both inoculant strains. The ratios of the strains in the inoculum did not affect the frequencies of mixed nodules. Generally one of the strains consistently occupied the majority of the nodules and ithe mixed nodules comprised the majority of bacteria. Transfer of the P-group R factor, RP4, between certain strains of Rhizobium within mixed nodules was detected. In some cases the non-parental progeny comprised 10% of the rhizobia isolated from such nodules.
