Data are presented showing phage types and antibiotic-resistant patterns of Staphylococcus aureus over the last 20 years. The spontaneous emergence of different phage types associated with increases and decreases in antibiotic resistance has been shown to be cyclic in nature with prevalence for 5 to 8 years, followed by spontaneous disappearance. Staphylococci resistant to almost all antibiotics and with specific phage types now are being isolated with increasing frequency and pose a serious and sometimes life-threatening situation in surgical patients.
