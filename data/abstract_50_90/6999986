A lactose-positive and chloramphenicol-resistant strain of Salmonella typhimurium of high virulence was isolated from an outbreak of enteric and septicemic salmonellosis in veal calves. the lactose-positive marker was located on an H1 plasmid, pJT2, together with resistance to chloramphenicol, streptomycin, sulfonamides, and tetracycline, pJT2 was unusually large and had a molecular weight of about 150 X 10(6). A similar plasmid was also present in a third of the Escherichia coli strains isolated from the intestines of septicemic calves during the outbreak. Spontaneously derived Lac- derivatives of pJT2 had an approximate molecular weight of 140 X 10(6).
