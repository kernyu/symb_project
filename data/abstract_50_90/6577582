Clinical aspects of Continuous Ambulatory Peritoneal Dialysis (CAPD) were studied in the first fifty patients started on CAPD at our hospital. CAPD was found to achieve good control of the uremic symptoms and of the biochemical values studied. Hypertension became less pronounced. The costs were found to be low. Twenty-four diabetic subjects were studied in detail. Intraperitoneal administration of insulin resulted in good metabolic control of the diabetes. The two catheters used for peritoneal access were compared. Because of problems related to the removal of the Toronto Western Hospital catheter it was concluded that the Tenckhoff catheter was to be preferred. Peritonitis was found to be the worst complication. Coagulase negative staphylococci accounted for 57% of the cases. During the study an increasing percentage of infections were caused by bacteria with multiple resistance to antibiotics. Netilmicin, a new aminoglycoside, was evaluated for the treatment of CAPD-related peritonitis. 84% of the cases responded. One of the nineteen patients treated sustained reversible vestibular toxicity. No other side effects were noted. In two patients right-sided hydrothorax was found to be a complication of peritoneal dialysis. In one case it was demonstrated that defects in the right diaphragm was the cause of the complication. In the other CAPD was continued despite the complication.
