In a prospective study, 46 episodes of serious infection with ticarcillin-resistant microorganisms were treated with the combination ticarcillin disodium and clavulanate potassium (Timentin). Clinical cure was achieved in 35 of the 46 episodes (76%), and microbiologic eradication was achieved in 30 (65%). We found no development of resistance to ticarcillin-clavulanate and observed no serious side effects.
