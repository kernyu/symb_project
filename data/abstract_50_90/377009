The 30 megadalton (Mdal)-conjugative, fi- plasmid pRSD1 determines inducible tetracycline resistance (Tc) in Escherichia coli. As shown by restriction analysis, a 3.5 Mdal-EcoRI fragment of pRSD1 spliced into the small plasmid pRSD2124 comprises the entire Tc determinant (tet) region. A restriction map of pRSD1 is presented which includes the location of the tet region and of an "underwound" loop not related to Tc (Burkardt et al., 1978). Selective amplification of tet genes is demonstrated by three lines of evidence. (i) The resistance level of cell harbouring pRSD1 increases approximately tenfold by induction with 10 microgram/ml of tetracycline. Further growth in the presence of 100 microgram/ml of the drug ("tetracycline stress") selects for cells with even higher resistance levels (about 300 microgram/ml) in rec+ cells. In a recA strain, a smaller proportion of cells attains these high resistance levels suggesting the involvement of host recombination. (ii) Electron micrographs of pRSD1-DNA isolated from tetracycline-stressed cells reveal a heterogeneous population of circular DNA molecules ranging between 1.7 and 21.6 micron. The distribution of contour lengths shows a discrete pattern ascribed to the presence of autonomous single- and multiple-copy Tc determinants and to intact plasmids containing zero to six tet regions in tandem repeats. (iii) This interpretation is supported by heteroduplex and restriction analyses which demonstrate the presence of multiple copies of the 3.5 Mdal-element encompassing the tet region in pRSD1 molecules selected by tetracycline stress. It has been concluded that gene amplification leading to tandem repetition of the tet region ensues in pRSD1. Such plasmids confer increased tetracycline resistance and can, thefore, be selected by high doses of the drug.
