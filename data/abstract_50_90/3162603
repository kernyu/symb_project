Strains of Streptococcus mutans with different surface hydrophobicity were examined for their ability to colonize and induce carious lesions in hamsters given a high sucrose diet. In a short-term experiment the hydrophobic strain GW showed almost an identical colonization pattern compared to the hydrophilic strain GW36. Streptomycin resistant variants of GW and GW36 implanted at a much slower rate than the parent strains. Differences in caries score were observed between the strains. The cariogenicity of the strains seemed to be dependent on early colonization.
