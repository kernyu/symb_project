We examined the effects of FK-506, a potent immunosuppressive agent, on the development of late asthmatic response (LAR) and on the increased bronchial responsiveness to acetylcholine following LAR in guinea pig model of asthma. Guinea pigs sensitized by repeated inhalation of ovalbumin (OA) were intravenously given metopiron 24 hours before and 30 minutes before antigen challenge and to prevent death from immediate severe bronchoconstriction, chlorpheniramine maleate was also injected. When we defined LAR as the responses with a two-fold increase in respiratory resistance during the late phase of antigen challenge, twelve out of fifteen control animals demonstrated apparent LAR. However, when guinea pigs were treated with FK-506 from the beginning of immunization period, the development of LAR was completely inhibited, although similar magnitude of immediate bronchoconstriction was observed, and a subsequent increase in bronchial responsiveness was significantly blocked. We also measured bronchial responsiveness to acetylcholine before, 24 and 72 hours after antigen challenge. FK-506-treated animals inhibited an increase in bronchial responsiveness to acetylcholine. These results suggest that the involvement of cell-mediated immunity may be important in the development of LAR and an increase in bronchial responsiveness.
