We examined the distribution of RNA levels expressed by the multidrug-resistance gene (MDR1, also known as PGY1) in 42 renal cell carcinoma (RCC) samples (38 primary and four metastatic lesions). The median MDR1 RNA level for the 38 primary lesions, expressed relative to the level for KB-3-1 cells, was approximately one-half of the level in multidrug-resistant KB-8-5 cells. Elevated MDR1 RNA levels were also observed in three of the four metastatic lesions. The mean MDR1 RNA level was higher in well-differentiated RCCs than in those that were poorly differentiated, suggesting that the increased expression of the MDR1 gene in RCCs originates from the increased expression in renal proximal tubule cells. To clarify the association of the MDR1 protein product P-glycoprotein with natural resistance to doxorubicin (ADR) in RCCs, we evaluated the effects of quinidine on in vitro sensitivity to ADR in 16 RCC samples, using a [3H]thymidine incorporation assay. The enhancing effect of quinidine (7.5 micrograms/mL) on sensitivity to ADR was statistically significant only in the group with high MDR1 RNA levels. Similar enhancement by quinidine of sensitivity to ADR was also observed in the established RCC cell lines in which MDR1 RNA levels were high. These results suggest that P-glycoprotein is active in the natural resistance of RCCs to ADR.
