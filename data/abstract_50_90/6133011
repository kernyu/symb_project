A fatal case of Ludwig's angina is reported in which penicillin was used as the sole antibiotic. Bacteroides melanogenicus resistant by virtue of production of Beta-lactamase was present. It is suggested that a combination of penicillin and an antibiotic effective against anaerobes such as metronidazole is the most appropriate initial chemotherapy pending confirmation from the bacteriology laboratory.
