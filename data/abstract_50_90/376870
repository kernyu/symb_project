This paper describes Q beta noninfectious particles produced at 41 degrees C in a streptomycin-resistant Escherichia coli mutant which is temperature sensitive for suppression of a nonsense codon. The noninfectious particles resembled Q beta under the electron microscope and contained coat protein molecules in an amount similar to the amount in Q beta. However, they did not adsorb to F-piliated bacteria, and they were deficient in both minor capsid proteins of Q beta, maturation (IIa) and read-through (IIb). Proteins IIa and IIb were not produced in Qbeta-infected mutant cells at 41 degrees C. In addition, instead of the 30S RNA of Q beta, a shorter RNA, which sedimented mainly at 23 S, was found in the defective particles. The results are discussed in relation to the roles of proteins IIa and IIb of Q beta.
