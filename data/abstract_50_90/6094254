Amphotericin B-induced lysis of erythrocytes is diminished in the presence of Cu2+, but the prelytic amphotericin B-induced K+ leakage is unaffected. These results and the weak binding of Cu2+ to amphotericin B, demonstrated by circular dichroism and EPR studies, are consistent with the view that Cu2+ protects erythrocytes by increasing their resistance to lysis.
