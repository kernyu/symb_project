We treated 142 patients with acute uncomplicated gonorrhea with a single oral dose of epiciline-probenecid. All cases were confirmed by culture on Thayer Martin medium at the first day and they were all laboratory tested seven days after treatment. At the control time the patients were asked about drug tolerance. All isolated strains were tested for beta-lactamase producing capacity and susceptibility to epiciline and penicillin. All patients who were culture positive seven days after treatment were considered to be treatment failures. The treatment was effective in 94.4% and we detected 8 Neisseria gonorrhoeae strains resistant to penicillin (5.6%); seven of these were PPNG strains. Tolerance to the drug was excellent in 90% of all cases; 9% presented minor adverse reactions for a short period of time. Therefore, the combination of epiciline-probenecid is a valid alternative for routine treatment of acute uncomplicated gonorrhea.
