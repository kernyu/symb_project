We administered norfloxacin (NFLX) to 16 children aged 3 to 14 year-old at the dose of 5.2 to 17.2 mg/kg/day. We evaluated the efficacy and safety of NFLX in 6 children with respiratory tract infections, 8 urinary tract infections, and 2 gastrointestinal tract infections. Efficacy rate of NFLX was 93.8% and eradicated rate was 92.9%. Any adverse effects were not observed. These results suggested that NFLX could be used safely to the children.
