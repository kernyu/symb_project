R62, a naturally occurring R factor, was shown to be a single deoxyribonucleic acid molecule composed of polynucleotide sequences typical of I group plasmids and also sequences typical of the N group. It determined I pili and belonged to the Ialpha compatibility group. Although compatible with plasmids of group N, R62 showed complex genetic reactions with N plasmids which are described and interpreted. It is concluded that R62 was the product of illegitimate recombination between an I group and an N group plasmid.
