Fundamental and clinical studies were performed by our study group to evaluate the usefulness of the combination (1:1) of imipenem (MK-0787), a carbapenem antibiotic, and cilastatin sodium (MK-0791), an inhibitor of dehydropeptidase-I, in the treatment of patients with obstetric and gynecologic infections. The following results were obtained. Antimicrobial activities of MK-0787 were tested with inocula of 10(6) cells/ml of organisms isolated from patients with obstetric and gynecologic infections. Peak MIC's of MK-0787 were less than or equal to 0.20 micrograms/ml for S. aureus, less than or equal to 0.20 micrograms/ml for S. epidermidis, 1.56 micrograms/ml for E. faecalis, 0.39 micrograms/ml for E. coli, less than or equal to 0.20 micrograms/ml for K. pneumoniae and less than or equal to 0.20 micrograms/ml for B. fragilis. When 0.5 g/0.5 g of MK-0787/MK-0791 was administered by a 30-minute intravenous drip infusion, maximum concentrations of MK-0787 in all female genital tissues were obtained at the end of the infusion, and Cmax ranged from 9.4 micrograms/g to 17.0 micrograms/g. In addition, the maximum concentration of MK-0787 in pelvic dead space exudate was 13.2 micrograms/ml at 88 minutes after the start of the infusion. The penetration of MK-0787/MK-0791 into female genital tissues and dead space exudate was found to be good and sufficient to cover MIC's against organisms isolated from patients with obstetric and gynecologic infections. Clinical efficacy was evaluated in 201 evaluable patients out of a total of 253 patients with obstetric and gynecologic infections. Clinical responses were excellent in 2, good in 181 and poor in 18 patients, and the efficacy rating was 91.0 percent. Efficacy ratings classified by types of infections were 93.2% (82/88) for intrauterine infections, 83.0% (39/47) for intrapelvic infections, 100% (26/26) for adnexitis, 90.0% (18/20) for infections of the external genital organs and 90.0% (18/20) for other infections. Side effects were observed in 6 of the 253 patients; rash in 4, nausea and vomiting in 1 and diarrhea in 1 patient. Abnormal laboratory findings were observed in 10 of the 253 patients; elevation of GOT, GPT, LDH and Al-P in 1, elevation of GOT, GPT and Al-P in 1, elevation of GOT and GPT in 4, elevation of GPT in 1, elevation of BUN in 1, increase of eosinophiles in 1, decrease of segmented neutrophils in 1 patient.
