The rapid lysis of Bacillus licheniformis NCTC 6346 and B. subtilis 168 trp caused by vancomycin and d-cycloserine can be inhibited by stopping protein synthesis. Protein synthesis must be stopped for more than one doubling time of the cells before addition of wall inhibitors. Poorly lytic mutants (lyt(-)) of B. licheniformis required 10 to 20 times the concentration of vancomycin or cycloserine to be added to growing cultures to cause even slow lysis. At lower concentrations growth of the mutants is stopped, but the bacteria remain fully viable. Sensitivity of mucopeptide synthesis to vancomycin is the same in both mutants and parent. Sensitivity to the action of d-cycloserine is slightly less in the mutant than in the parent.
