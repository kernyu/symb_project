Antineoplastic agents are known to induce differential cytotoxic and cytostatic effects throughout the cell cycle. Many drugs have greater toxicity for cycling cells and act selectively at one or more phases of the cycle and may cause partial synchrony of surviving cells. However, these observations have been generally carried out on in vitro systems only and present a variety of complexities and pitfalls. Furthermore, human tumours are often characterized by a relatively low fraction of proliferating cells and present a large cellular heterogeneity as far as their cytogenetic, cytokinetic, and clonogenic features and their responses to drugs are concerned. Therefore, resistance to chemotherapy is due to various factors characterizing, in some instances, each individual tumour. In spite of the advent of technological advances such as flow cytometry, it is still difficult to design kinetic-orientated therapies especially for the treatment of solid tumours. Consequently, it is also difficult to design protocols based on cell cycle effective drugs. The possibility remains, at least for the moment, to stratify tumours according to their cellular heterogeneity. Different protocols could then be assigned to classes of tumours. Such an approach could be completed by further advances in the cellular monitoring of individual tumours.
