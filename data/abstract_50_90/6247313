The ability of ceftizoxime to penetrate the outer membrane was compared with those of five other new cephalosporins: cefotiam, cefuroxime, cefotaxime, cefmetazole and cefoxitin, using a clinical isolate of Enterobacter cloacae as a test strain. Estimation of permeability was performed by a method utilizing the inhibitory activities of the cephalosporins against beta-lactamase located in the periplasm. Of the cephalosporins tested, both ceftizoxime and cefmetazole gave remarkably high concentrations in the periplasm, several times higher than those of cefotaxime and cefoxitin and ten or more times higher than those of cefuroxime and cefotiam. The approximate permeability coefficient of ceftizoxime was also several times higher than those of cefotiam and cefmetazole and over ten times higher than those of cefoxitin, cefuroxime and cefotaxime.
