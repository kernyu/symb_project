Lebr 625 and Lebr 350 cells, resistant to ethidium bromide in concentrations 25 and 50 mkg/ml, are able to grow continuously in serum- and protein-free media. Under the same conditions the parental L929 cells are not able to. Two cell lines (625 sf and 350 sf) were established capable of growing in serum- and protein free media. It is found that ethidium bromide is toxic for resistant cells grown the in serum-free medium. The addition of serum lowers the toxic action of ethidium bromide. A continuous growth of resistant cells in serum-free medium (under nonselective conditions) leads to a decreased level of resistance, which may nevertheless persist for a long period of cultivation (over 2.5 years).
