The conjugative plasmids determining sulfonamide resistance in five Shigella strains, each isolated from a different patient, have been characterized. One S. flexneri 2a strain, isolated in 1952, harbored an fi(+) plasmid of molecular weight 53 x 10(6), which specified synthesis of F-like pili and bore determinants for sulfonamide resistance (Su) and bacteriocinogeny (Col). This plasmid was compatible with plasmids of groups F(I), F(II), I(alpha), and P. A second S. flexneri 2a strain isolated in 1952 harbored an fi(-) plasmid of molecular weight 59 x 10(6), bearing the Su determinant and compatible with all plasmids tested. This strain also harbored an fi(+) group-F(II) plasmid of molecular weight 42 x 10(6), which bore the Col determinant and specified synthesis of F-like pili. Three S. dysenteriae 2 strains isolated in 1956 carried apparently identical fi(-) plasmids of molecular weight 58 x 10(6), which bore the Su determinant, could form transconjugants in Pseudomonas but not in Proteus, and were incompatible with the P-group plasmid RP4.
