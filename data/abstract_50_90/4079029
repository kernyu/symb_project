A newly developed human immunoglobulin for intravenous use, SM-4300, purified by cold ethanol precipitation and ion exchange resin, has been studied in the surgery. SM-4300 has been evaluated clinically against inpatients with severe bacterial and/or fungal infections in the combined use with the antibiotics which were resistant to antibiotic therapy. Total number of 13 patients affected with various severe infections were treated with SM-4300. Clinical effects of SM-4300 were excellent in 2 cases, good in 6, fair in 3 and poor in 2. The efficacy rate was summarized as 61.5%. No subjective and objective clinical side effects and abnormal laboratory findings were observed. In conclusion, combination therapy with SM-4300 and antibiotics was considered to be safe and effective against severe bacterial and/or fungal infections in the surgery.
