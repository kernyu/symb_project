Escherichia coli O114 strains isolated from infants in the course of a hospital outbreak of enteritis were identical with type strain 26W in antigenic structure (O114:K90a, 90b), and in immunoelectrophoretic pattern (ORSKOV's group 1Bb) but differed from it in fermenting salicin late (18-22 days) and in phage pattern (group A4); the strains produced colicin and were lysogenic. Pathogenicity of the organism was proved by IgM type antibodies in a patient's serum rising in a titre of 1:128 and by its enterotoxin-producing capacity shown by the rabbit ileal loop assay.
