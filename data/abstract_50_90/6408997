Progress of cancer chemotherapy has been mainly owed to the development of new antitumor drugs and the devices for enhancing the therapeutic effect of antitumor drugs. As for the enhancement of therapeutic effect, there are three major devices, that is, 1) a device to enhance the therapeutic effect by changing drug formulation, 2) enhancement of therapeutic effect by the combination of antitumor drugs with other treatment modalities and 3) enhancement by the combination with non-antitumor drugs. In this paper, major topics of these recent studies in Japan were reviewed. Especially, experimental studies on the enhancement of antitumor effect by the combination of antitumor drugs with calcium or calmodulin inhibitors and also overcome of vincristine resistance by the combination of vincristine with a calcium antagonist, verapamil, were described.
