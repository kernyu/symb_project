Some oligotrophic microorganisms were characterised in terms of their resistance against a broad spectrum of antibiotics and certain dynamic parameters of membranes obtained by analysing the EPR and NMR spectra. The oligotrophic bacteria differed in these characteristics from eutrophic microorganisms. The oligotrophic bacteria were subdivided into 3-4 subgroups different in many of the studied parameters. A new chemotaxonomic approach was proposed for the oligotrophic bacteria basing on the analysis of antibioticograms.
