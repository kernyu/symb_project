An assay for the evaluation of antiviral and immunomodulator potency was developed using pure populations of cultured human monocytes. The assay involved culturing of human monocytes until they were fully susceptible (15-20 days) to lytic infection with HSV-1. When susceptible cells were cultured with recombinant interferon-alpha or a synthetic interferon inducer such as polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid prior to infection, a significant enhancement in resistance to the cytopathic effects of HSV-1 was observed. Likewise, a dose dependent reduction in cell lysis was observed when acyclovir was added immediately after virus infection. Monocyte resistance to HSV-1 was determined by the retention of pinocytic activity as determined by the uptake of neutral red dye. Relative pinocytic activity was quantitated using a simple colorimetric procedure. This antiviral assay can be completed in 48 h; is easy to perform, highly sensitive and reproducible.
