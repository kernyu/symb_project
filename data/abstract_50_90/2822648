The in-vitro activity of LY146032 was studied against Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, Corynebacterium JK, and Bacillus spp. in comparison with several agents with action against Gram-positive bacteria. LY146032 showed an MIC90 of 0.4 mg/l for S. aureus, regardless of the resistance to penicillin or oxacillin. LY146032 was equivalent in activity to ciprofloxacin and vancomycin against S. aureus and moderately active against other species tested (MIC90, 0.8-3.2 mg/l).
