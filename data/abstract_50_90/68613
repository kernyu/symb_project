Drug resistant mutants to streptomycin, kanamycin, viomycin, capreomycin, and rifampicin were isolated from four strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The mutants isolated from each parent were then tested for evidence of development of cross-resistance to other drugs. There was no cross-resistance between either streptomycin or rifampicin and any of the other drugs. Complete cross-resistance between viomycin and capreomycin was found. Cross-resistance between kanamycin and capreomycin, and kanamycin and viomycin was variable. A review of the medical histories of 27 patients with kanamycin-resistant tubercle bacilli indicated that cross-resistance with capreomycin and viomycin occurs, but is unpredictable. Because of this variability in cross-resistance and the fact that kanamycin is a more toxic drug than capreomycin, it is suggested that capreomycin be used in the first retreatment regimen for tuberculosis when streptomycin resistance has been demonstrated.
