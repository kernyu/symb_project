A 22.4-kilobase DNA fragment containing the tmrA7-amyR2-amyE+-tmrB+-aroI+ region of the Bacillus subtilis N7 chromosomal DNA was cloned into a recombinant B. subtilis bacteriophage, p11-AA248. The amyE+-tmrB+ gene region, approximately 12.6 kilobases, in the phage genome was amplified in a tunicamycin-resistant (Tmr) Amy+ AroI+ transductant of B. subtilis by p11-AA248. On the other hand, the amyE+-tmrB+ region in the genomes of 80 to 90% of the phage particles was deleted when the phages were induced from the Tmr Amy+ AroI+ transductants by treatment with 1.0 micrograms of mitomycin C per ml. From analyses of the physical maps and DNA nucleotide sequences in the junction region of the deleted phage genome and the parental DNA fragments, it is suggested that the deletion occurred within a direct repeat sequence composed of 18 base pairs. The endpoints of the amplified gene region seemed to be closely related to both terminal regions of the deleted DNA.
