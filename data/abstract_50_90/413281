From incubators and children in a premature-born unit, a number of red-pigmented Ps. aeruginosa strains, resistant to kanamycin, streptomycin and lividomycin and producing haemolytic toxin II, were isolated and investigated for transfer of resistance in mixed cultures. Streptomycin, kanamycin and lividomycin resistance was co-transferred, from some strains, together with the ability of toxin production. Transfer ability was also co-transferred which might have genetic as well as epidemiological significance. Strains do produce "Autoplaques" and transferability of this property as well as of lysogeny is under investition.
