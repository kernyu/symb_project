A new species of nocardioform actinomycete isolated from spontaneously heated sugar-cane bagasse is described as Saccharopolyspora hirsuta gen. et sp. nov. It has affinities with species of both Nocardia and Actinomadura but can be distinguished from both genera by its morphology, sporulation, wall and lipid analyses, antibiotic resistance, degradation and carbon utilzation tests.
