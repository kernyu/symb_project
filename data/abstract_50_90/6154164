Lymphokine-containing sera (LKS) inhibited the growth of adenocarcinoma BW10232 and melanoma B16 in C57BL/L mice. Resistance to tumor growth was conferred by daily injections into the challenge site. The injection of LKS did not provide long-term resistance, inasmuch as termination of treatment permitted resumption of tumor growth at the primary tumor site. Whether LKS exerted a direct or indirect effect on the tumor cells to retard their was not certain.
