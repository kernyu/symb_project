Several natural isolate E. coli strains highly resistant to sulfonamides and antibiotics are shown to contain a sulfonamide-resistant dihydropteroate synthase (2-amino-4-hydroxy-6-hydroxymethyl-7,8-dihydropteridine-diphosphate:4-aminobenzoa te 2-amino-4-hydroxydihydropteridine-6-methenyltransferase, EC 2.5.1.15) in addition to the normal sensitive enzyme. The resistant dihydropteroate synthases examined are determined by an R plasmid and are smaller and less heat stable than the normal sulfonamide-sensitive enzyme. One synthase resistant to any sulfonamide tested, and to sulfanilic and arsanilic acids, was still inhibited by several non-sulfonamide analogs of p-aminobenzoate. Citrobacter and Klebsiella pneumoniae strains also show similar mechanisms of sulfonamide resistance.
