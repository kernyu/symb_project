We have found a new transposon, Tn2610, on pCS200 in clinical isolates of Escherichia coli, which encodes the carbenicillin-hydrolyzing beta-lactamase gene in combination with the resistance determinants to streptomycin and sulfonamide. Tn2610 has a molecular size of 24 kilobase pairs and is flanked by long inverted repeat sequences of 3 kilobase pairs in length. Genetical and physical analyses indicate that Tn2610 is a single transposable unit encoding the multiple resistance determinants and that is different from any previously described transposon. The characteristic DNA structure observed in various complex resistance transposons involved in the transposition of the carbenicillin-hydrolyzing beta-lactamase gene is discussed.
