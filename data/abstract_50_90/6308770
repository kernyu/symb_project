Vasoactive intestinal peptide stimulated the synthesis of adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate in fractions of isolated carp horizontal cells. When applied extracellularly to isolated and cultured horizontal cells, the peptide also induced a slow depolarization (30 to 40 millivolts) accompanied by a decrease in membrane resistance. However, analogs of adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate applied extracellularly or intracellularly, and forscolin applied extracellularly, had no effect on the membrane potential of cultured horizontal cells, indicating that the induced depolarization was not related to the accumulation of adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate in these cells.
