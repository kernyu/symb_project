We compared the effects of the cationic ionophore, monensin, on the synthesis, maturation and release of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) in cultures of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and the monensin-resistant clone, MonR-31. Our results depended on the dose and time of the addition of monensin to the infected cells, from 1 h prior to VSV infection to 1 h after infection. VSV production was more resistant in MonR-31 than in CHO cells when the ionophore was added 1 h prior to VSV infection. Monensin added 1 h after VSV infection showed the opposite phenomenon; release of virus particles into the medium was 10- to 10(5)-fold less in MonR-31 cells than in CHO cells, and the intracellular virus number in the resistant cells was one-third to one-fourth of that in the parental CHO cells. Syntheses of all virus-associated G, N and M proteins were inhibited in both cell lines by monensin, but especially so in the MonR-31 cells. There were no marked qualitative changes in the biochemical properties of viral glycoprotein G in virus-infected CHO and MonR-31 cells treated with monensin after virus infection. An endoglycosidase H-resistant G with a molecular weight smaller than that of normal G and attachments of palmitate or fucose on the truncated G protein appeared. Alteration of the secretion of as well as the synthesis of the enveloped virus is discussed in relation to the monensin susceptibility of the resistant MonR-31 clone.
