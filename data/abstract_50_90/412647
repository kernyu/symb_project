A new aminoglycoside antibiotic, netilmicin, was tested against 306 clinical isolates from ill children and compared with sisomicin and gentamicin. Activity against Enterobacteriaceae was similar to that of gentamicin but less than that of sisomicin. Two gentamicin-resistant strains of Enterobacteriaceae (Klebsiella, MIC 6.25 microgram/ml, Escherichia coli, MIC 12.5 microgram/ml) were susceptible to netilimicin (MIC 3.12 microgram/ml). Netilmicin was ineffective against almost all strains of Pseudomonas but active against the majority of strains of Staphylococcus, Neisseria meningitidis and Haemophilus influenzae tested. Disc diffusion sensitivity results correlated in general with the agar dilution test. Netilmicin had little activity against Pseudomonas but may be useful in the treatment of infections due to gentamicin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae.
