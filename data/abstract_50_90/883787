The effect of subsequent cyclic administration of oleandomycin and tetracycline on the titer of the complement, the content of lysozyme, the bactericidal properties of the serum and the presence of the antibiotic specific antibodies in the blood serum found in the Hoigne reaction were studied on rabbits. It was found that the subsequent cyclic administration of the antibiotics to both the intact animals and the animals with experimental staphylococcal sepsis was accompanied by an increase in the titer of the complement only on the 7th day of administration of oleandomycin, the first antibiotic. The subsequent administration of tetracycline and especially discontinuation of the antibiotics use resulted in a significant, stable and prolonged decrease in the complement titer. The cyclic subsequent administration of oleandomycin and tetracycline for 7 days was accompanied by an increase in the lysozyme content and serum bactericidal properties. Changes in the factors of non-specific resistance under the effect of the subsequent cyclic administration of oleandomycin and tetracycline on both the intact animals and the animals with experimental staphylococcal sepsis were accompanied by an appearance, progressive increase and prolonged preservation in the serum of the antibiotic specific antibodies found in the Hoigne reaction. A possibility of producing specific antibodies simultaneously to the 2 antibiotics, i. e. oleandomycin and tetracycline in their administration in subsequent 7-day cycles was shown.
