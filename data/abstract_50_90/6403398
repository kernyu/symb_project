Using conventional electrophysiological techniques, we have investigated the electrical responses of mouse and hamster oocytes in metaphase of the second meiotic division to agents which induce parthenogenetic activation. Oocytes from MF1 mice responded to 8.7% ethanol and to 0.3% benzyl alcohol by a depolarization (sometimes preceded by a brief hyperpolarization). The response to ethanol did not "desensitize," and the membrane potential recovered completely when the exposure to ethanol was interrupted. The response was accompanied by a decrease in membrane input resistance (Rin) and had an equilibrium potential of about +5 mV in standard medium and of -10mV in Na-free medium. The oocytes responded to A23187 and to La3+ by an increased Rin, and usually lysed during or after treatment. Multiphasic responses were elicited by ethanol and by Ca-ionophore in metaphase II hamster oocytes; an early hyperpolarization accompanied by a decreased Rin was a common feature of the response to both activating agents. The early hyperpolarization was no longer elicited when the cells were exposed for a second time to ethanol or A23187. K+ and Cl- were the ions mainly involved in the hyperpolarizing potential elicited by A23187, and K+ (but not Cl-) was the ionic species mainly involved in ethanol response. The above responses were peculiar to metaphase II oocytes since mouse and hamster ovarian oocytes (in prophase I) and fertilized eggs either failed to respond to the activating agents, or responded by increasing Rin. The variety of electrical responses to parthenogenetic agents indicates that in mammalian oocytes parthenogenetic activation is not triggered by a "classical" activation potential.
