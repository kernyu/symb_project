Serial transplantation in nude mice of human choriocarcinoma showed the drug resistance in clinic was succeeded and experimental chemotherapy has been studied to improve the prognosis of the patients with choriocarcinoma. The experimental tumors were two lines. CC-I-JCK (JCK) and CC-HM-I- (HM). In this paper, single and/or combination chemotherapy with methotrexate (MTX), actinomycin D (ACD), cyclophosphamide (CMP), and vincristine (VCR) were discussed. 1) Effects of the single agent: In JCK, the suppressive effects against tumor growth under administration of CPM or VCR, and some responses in histological finding were obtained. While, in HM, few suppressive effects against tumor growth and some responses in histological findings were obtained. 2) Effects of the combined agents: In JCK, the suppressive effects against tumor growth were as follows; nontreatment group less than MTX + ACD less than MTX + CPM less than MTX + ACD + CPM less than ACD + CPM less than ACD + CPM + VCR. The complete disappearance of tumors were gained under administration of the combination therapy with ACD and CPM. While in in HM, the effects were as follows; nontreatment group less than MTX + ACD less than ACD + CPM less than MTX + ACD + CPM less than MTX + CPM less than MTX + CPM + VRC. But no complete disappearance of tumor was obtained. 3) The good relationship between the results of experimental chemotherapy and the response of clinical patients who provided the tissues could be seen. It has been defined that the experimental chemotherapy with the tumors transplanted to nude mice in useful models for the establishment of rational chemotherapy for drug resistant choriocarcinoma.
