This report from the Tuberculosis Chemotherapy Centre, Madras, describes the progress, over a 5-year period, of 341 patients with newly diagnosed, sputum-positive tuberculosis. All the patients were treated on a domiciliary basis. In the first year, the patients received, on the basis of random allocation, a standard regimen of isoniazid plus PAS or 1 of 3 regimens of isoniazid alone. Previous reports have shown that the response in the first year was substantially superior with the standard regimen, and that the bacteriological relapse rates in the second year were fairly similar for the 4 regimens. The findings in the present report extend the latter conclusion to the end of 5 years. Further, when considered together with the findings in an earlier study, they have shown that isoniazid, given as maintenance chemotherapy in the second year, was highly effective in preventing bacteriological relapse in patients who, at 1 year, had bacteriologically quiescent disease and no residual cavitation; the effect was, however, less marked in patients with residual cavitation at 1 year.Patients who were clear-cut failures of the allocated chemotherapy and those who had a bacteriological relapse in the second or subsequent years were usually re-treated with streptomycin plus PAS or streptomycin plus pyrazinamide, and if this was ineffective, with cycloserine plus thioacetazone or cycloserine plus ethionamide.Considering the findings over the 5-year period for all patients, 16 died from non-tuberculous causes and 1 took his discharge prematurely. Of the remainder, 86% had bacteriologically quiescent disease at 5 years, 6% had bacteriologically active disease and 8% had died of tuberculosis. These findings confirm the value of well-organized domiciliary chemotherapy, which was established by an earlier report from the Centre, and are particularly encouraging for developing countries such as India, where tuberculosis is a major problem and resources are limited.
