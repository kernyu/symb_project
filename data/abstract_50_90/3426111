Whatever the product used as a food additive, ("traditional" antibiotic or carbadox) it is likely to increase the proportion of enterobacteria resistant to it. This phenomenon is commonly seen with chloramphenicol, neomycin and ampicillin, whether used as feed additives or therapeutic agents. The use of carbadox also selects strains which are resistant to it, but this increase is much lower than those given by the traditional antibiotics and tends to be reversed when the drug is withdrawn. All the products select coding plasmids for multiple resistances. Resistance to carbadox is most often transferable to the strains of E coli C600 and 14R525; but the Salmonella which were tested proved to be very bad recipients of carbadox resistance.
