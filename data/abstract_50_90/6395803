Klebsiella aerogenes harbouring the plasmid pBR322 was grown in continuous culture at various growth rates under glucose, phosphate or ammonia limitation. With tetracycline in the medium, the maximum culture beta-lactamase activity was found at the higher growth rates. When tetracycline was absent, loss of resistance to the drug occurred. Concomitant with the occurrence of drug-sensitive cells, the culture beta-lactamase activity decreased. At the higher growth rates the enzyme activity decreased at a slightly higher rate than did the resistance to tetracycline. From this it was concluded that the beta-lactamase activity per mg cellular dry weight of the drug-resistant fraction of the population was still decreasing during the appearance of drug-sensitive cells. At the higher growth rates, this decrease was independent of the nutrient that was growth-limiting.
