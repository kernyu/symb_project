Resensibilization in vitro to seven antibiotics under the influence of DMSO was studied in 624 resistant strains of five species of bacteria (E. coli, S. typhi, S. pyogenes, S. viridans, S. aureus), 61 strains of tubercle bacilli resistant to isonicotinic acid hydrazide (INH) and 19 strains of tubercle bacilli resistant to rifampicin (RMP). DMSO in concentrations of 0.1-10.0% caused reversion of sensitivity in strains of E. coli, S. pyogenes and S. viridans. Reversion in vivo of sensitivity to INH of tubercle bacilli was studied in experimental tuberculosis of guinea pigs. Tubercle bacilli previously resistant to INH recovered complete sensitivity to the drug, enabling animals infected with the INH-resistant strain of bacilli to be treated with INH.
