In developing countries of tropical Africa and South-East Asia chancroid is the most important cause of genital ulzerations. In the last decade also in industrial countries of the western hemisphere sporadic epidemics of this sexually transmitted disease were observed. This surprising revival of a disease already thought to have died out induced advances in cultivation and characterization of the etiologic agent as well as new therapeutic approaches. Treatment regimens based on erythromycin, cephalosporins of the third generation or a combination of amoxillin with the beta-lactamase inhibitor clavulanic acid can be recommended. Penicillins and tetracyclines are mostly ineffective because of plasmid-mediated resistance in Haemophilus ducreyi. As in other sexually transmitted diseases simultaneous infections with other pathogens have to be taken into consideration. The sexual partners of the patients should likewise be examined and if need, be treated.
