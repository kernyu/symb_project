The Raji line of human lymphoblastoid cells, which does not show expression of Epstein-Barr virus, was made resistant to 5-bromodeoxyuridine. Within several weeks after removal of the drug, Epstein-Barr virus particles were detected in the cells. The sequence of virus appearance in the 5-bromodeoxyuridine-resistant cells indicated drug-induced activation of a repressed Epstein-Barr virus genome.
