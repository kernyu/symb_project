The properties of 279 Ps. aeruginosa strains were studied in 70 tests. The use of a synthetic peptone-free mineral medium for the determination of sugar oxidation was shown to have advantages over the use of liquid Giess' media. Ps. aeruginosa cultures isolated from human patients, animals, soil and water were characterized by a number of common signs, irrespective of their origin. The strains isolated from human patients were resistant practically to all antibiotics widely used in clinical practice; the cultures isolated from soil and water retained their sensitivity to antibiotics; the strains isolated from animals retained sensitivity to some antibiotics. To identify Ps. aeruginosa in practical bacteriological laboratories, the following parameters should be determined: mobility; the character of growth in Levine's and Ploskirev's media; ability to grow at 42 degrees C and 4 degrees C; the fermentation of carbohydrates in Olkenitsky's medium and their oxidation in a mineral medium; indole and hydroxide sulfide production; the methyl red and Voges--Proskauer reaction; the presence of pigments, oxidase, catalase, gelatinase, nitrate reductase and arginine dehydrolase, urease; resistance to antibiotics.
