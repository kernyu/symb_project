The activity of ofloxacin and cefotaxime, alone or combined, against four strains of Enterobacteriaceae was evaluated both in vitro and in sera from volunteers given a single infusion over 30 min of 200 mg ofloxacin or 1 g cefotaxime. The strains showed resistance or decreased susceptibility to third-generation cephalosporins. The combination was not found to be synergistic in vitro. Analysis of the bactericidal titres and killing kinetics of sera taken at the time of the peak concentration and 6 h after the infusion, respectively, confirmed the absence of synergy between the drugs against these strains.
