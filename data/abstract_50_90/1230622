Comparative investigations of the sterilizing action produced on the stomatological instruments by 4 chemical bactericidal agents and hot air tend to give preference to sterilization with a 2% solution of glutamic acid in a combination with a 70% isopropyl alcohol at a 45 minutes long exposure. Such a sterilization does not cause any corrosion of the instruments and reduces to a lesser degree the resistance of the cutting edges than in the case of sterilization with hot air.
