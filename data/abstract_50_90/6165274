Eight clones and two subclones of SV40- and seven clones and one subclone of 20-methylcholanthrene-transformed C3H mouse embryonic fibroblasts were compared in tests for sensitivity to the antiviral and cell-growth inhibitory activities of a partially purified mouse L-cell interferon. While the sensitivity of clones and subclones to the antiviral activity of interferon was comparable to that of parent lines, the cell-growth inhibitory activity of interferon in the SV40 clones showed more than 100-fold variation and the methylcholanthrene-transformed cells could be divided into two groups in this respect. No correlation of sensitivity to the cell-growth inhibitory effect of interferon with the chromosome number, interferon-producing capacity or tumorigenicity of the clones could be detected. However, the cells of the interferon-sensitive clones No. 36 of the methylcholanthrene-transformed line were destroyed by macrophages at higher percentage binding of 125I-labeled soybean lectin. These results suggest that (1) the cell-growth inhibitory effect of interferon might be mediated by a specific type of receptors, and (2) N-acetyl-galactosamine present on the surface of interferon-resistant cells in a higher concentration than on interferon-sensitive cells hinders the recognition of cells both by macrophages and by interferon.
