Sensitivity of 575 NAG-vibrio strains isolated from various substrates in 1978-1980 to 14 antibiotics was studied and compared with the results of an analogous study performed in 1968 by Z. V. Ermolyeva et al. It was shown that sensitivity of NAG-vibrio to chloramphenicol, ampicillin, cephaloridine and streptomycin decreased. However, NAG-vibrio remain to be sensitive to tetracycline, chloramphenicol and gentamicin. Resistance of the majority of the strains to ampicillin, carbenicillin, cephaloridine and polymyxin M was noted.
