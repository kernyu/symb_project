Methanal (formaldehyde) preserved and ethane acid peroxide finally sterilised aortic segments showed in vitro and in vivo a significant decrease of the material characteristics in case of watering for 180 days. Intraperitoneal incorporation in a xenogeneous animal species during 60 days reduced the mechanical stability of the substitutes without long-term watering and also with long-term watering, but with an additionally greater negative effect.
