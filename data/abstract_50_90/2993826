The effect of Coumermycin (CA1) on the replication of different ecotropic retroviruses was studied. Most strains showed reductions in infectivity of less than ten fold, while two strains demonstrated a marked sensitivity to the drug. The isolation of one resistant strain could suggest a specific CA1 antiviral activity.
