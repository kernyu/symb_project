Third-generation cephalosporins are indicated for treatment of sexually transmitted diseases, resistant salmonellosis, and infections in the febrile leukopenic host. The practicing physician must weigh the expanding role of these agents against their limitations. Some potential problems include bleeding (confined to the use of moxalactam [Moxam] or cefoperazone [Cefobid]), a reaction like that to disulfiram (Antabuse) when combined with alcohol (also confined to the use of moxalactam or cefoperazone), and superinfection. A prolonged course of treatment entails significant expense. Further evaluation and clinical experience is necessary before use of third-generation cephalosporins for some of the newer indications (eg, late stages of Lyme disease, neurosyphilis) becomes routine medical practice.
