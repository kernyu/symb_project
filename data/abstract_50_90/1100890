In vitro antibacterial activities of ampicillin and amoxycillin were compared against pigmented and non-pigmented strains of Serratia marcescens. Ampicillin appeared more effective than amoxycillin; three-fourths of all strains consistently exhibited an ampicillin minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of at least one tube less than that recorded for amoxycillin. Complete cross resistance was not observed as has previously been inferred. Further, greater bactericidal activity was demonstrated with ampicillin; minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBC) were either the same as or one tube greater than the MIC. MBC's for amoxycillin, however, were significantly higher; often four to five times greater than the MIC. Ampicillin exhibited greater bactericidal activity as inferred from differences observed in the biological lesions induced, as recorded through observations by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Spheroplasts were the predominant morphological alteration induced by ampicillin. In contrast, only filament formation, which demonstrated a degree of reversibility, was induced by amoxycillin.
