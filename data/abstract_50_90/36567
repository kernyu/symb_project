Antibacterial activity of pure preparations of mycotoxins, was studied against strains of Bacillus thuringiensis (Berliner). Most of fungal metabolites used provokes: 1) Growth bacterial inhibition similar to lethal effect of antibiotics 2) Enlargment of cell volume; this cell abnormality induction resembles those obtained with mitomycin C. The bioassay of fungal toxins with B. thuringiensis can be recommended as a sensitive technique to supplement chemical characterization. By using specific cell lines to such a mycotoxin and specific inactivators as coumarin for aflatoxin, or sulfhydryl compounds for penicillic acid and patulin.
