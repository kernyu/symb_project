Low-level transferable resistance to ceftazidime was detected in seven strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae and one strain of Escherichia coli. Six of the Klebsiella strains and the E. coli strain were shown to produce a novel beta-lactamase (CAZ-lo) with a pI of 5.6 that hydrolyzed broad-spectrum cephalosporins at low but comparable levels. One strain of K. pneumoniae was of a serotype different from that of the other strains and produced a plasmid-encoded cefuroximase (FUR) with a pI of 7.5 that mediated moderate levels of resistance to different broad-spectrum cephalosporins. High-level resistance to ceftazidime was detected in one other strain of K. pneumoniae, which produced a beta-lactamase with a pI of 6.5 (CAZ-hi). Apart from its pI, this enzyme differed from CAZ-lo by a specific and high hydrolytic activity against ceftazidime. The epidemiological context suggested that CAZ-hi may be a mutant of CAZ-lo, and this hypothesis was supported by the isolation of laboratory mutants of CAZ-lo showing properties identical to those of the clinical CAZ-hi enzyme.
