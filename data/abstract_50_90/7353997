A transfer-deficient derivative of plasmid RP1-pMG1 was isolated after insertion of Mu cts62. The Tra- R plasmid was used to donate Tn904, encoding streptomycin resistance, to Ti plasmid pAL102 harbored by Agrobacterium tumefaciens Ach5. Under conditions promoting high Ti transfer frequencies, 155 strains were isolated in which the streptomycin marker coupled with Ti plasmid in further transfer experiments. These isolates represent stable insertions of Tn904 into the Ti plasmid. In addition, 19 strains were isolated in which the insertion of Tn904 was apparently unstable. The frequency of stable Tn904 transpositions was estimated to be 3 x 10(4-) per transferred Ti plasmid. Evidence was obtained that Tn904 readily may transpose from the Ti plasmid into the bacterial chromosome. The strains carrying Ti plasmids with stable insertions were characterized with respect to virulence, octopine degradation, octopine synthesis in induced tumors, and Ti plasmid transfer. Thirteen of the strains were found to be affected in tumor-inducing ability.
