The dipeptide antibiotic bacilysin is active against a wide range of bacteria and against Candida albicans. Its C-terminal amino acid, anticapsin, is a very poor antibacterial agent. The activities of both substances are strongly dependent on the nature of the culture medium. In a minimal medium the minimum inhibitory concentration for bacilysin with E. coli B is 10(-3) mug ml(-1). The action of bacilysin amino acids. With several bacteria, bacilysin-resistant mutants are found in unusually large numbers. It is suggested that peptide and amino acid transport systems play a role in these phenomena. The antimicrobial action of bacilysin is also inhibited by glucosamine and N-acetylglucosamine. This antibiotic may therefore interfere with glucosamine synthesis and thus with the synthesis of microbial cell walls.
