T-1982 (cefbuperazone), a new cephamycin antibiotic, was clinically and bacteriologically studied in 25 children with bacterial infections. The following results were obtained. 1. The antibacterial activity of T-1982 was determined against clinically isolated bacteria. T-1982 demonstrated excellent activity against Gram-negative bacilli, the MICs being less than 0.39 microgram/ml against E. coli and K. oxytoca, less than 1.56 microgram/ml against H. influenzae. 2. Clinical response was excellent or good in all 24 cases evaluated. The efficacy rate was 100%. 3. As for side effects associated with T-1982, slight and transient elevation of GOT, GPT and eosinophil, slight decrease of platelet and eruption were observed. From these results, T-1982 is considered to be a useful antibiotic for treating bacterial infections in children.
