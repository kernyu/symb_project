The clinical effectiveness of a new synthetic pyridoncarboxylic acid derivative, norfloxacin (NFLX: Baccidal) was studied in the urological field. NFLX was given clinically to 50 patients with urogenital tract infections; 40 cases were acute simple cystitis and 10 cases were complicated UTI satisfied the criteria of the UTI committee. Thirty two bacterial strains were isolated from the group of acute simple cystitis and 10 bacterial strains were isolated from the group of complicated UTI. Susceptibility of NFLX by the method of distribution and disk sensitivity was 97% in the former group and 89% in the latter group. The overall clinical efficacy rate estimated by the criteria of the UTI committee in 32 cases with acute simple cystitis was 97% and in 10 cases with complicated UTI was 60%. The incidence of side effect was 8.0% (4/50). All of these side effects which were nausea, abdominal fullness and headache may be attributable to the administration of NFLX. No abnormal laboratory findings were observed except for elevation in GOT and GPT values in 1 case (4.0%), which returned to normal after NFLX treatment. Therefore NFLX is suggested to be a clinically useful and safe drug in the treatment of UTI.
