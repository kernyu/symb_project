The extension of chloroquines resistance of Plasmodium falciparum, the emergence, still limited, of resistance to pyrimethamine-sulfadoxine, and even of multi-resistant strains, are facts all the more disturbing--especially for South East Asia--that the number of antimalarials is limited. Mefloquine appears to be a very promising drug; it might perhaps be desirable to be able to combine it with a new antimalarial, in collective prophylaxis, to prevent the selection of possibly resistant strains.
