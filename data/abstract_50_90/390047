Twenty-three of 89 enterotoxigenic strains of Escherichia coli were resistant to one or more antimicrobial agents. Eleven strains transferred resistance directly and five transferred resistance after mobilization. In three cases a resistant recipient was enterotoxigenic. One of these strains contained a conjugative plasmid carrying genes for both drug resistance and enterotoxin production. In the two other strains genes for drug resistance and enterotoxin production were carried on separate co-transferable plasmids.
