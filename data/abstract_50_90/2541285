We studied the efficacy of tazobactam (YTR 830), a new beta-lactamase inhibitor in combination with piperacillin (P) against 198 Enterobacteriaceae strains. A comparative study of susceptibility (MIC determined on Mueller Hinton agar; inoculum 10(4) cfu) was made with the combination amoxicillin (A) + clavulanic acid (CA). Of 181 strains resistant to P, 79.56% were susceptible to it in the presence of tazobactam (TZ). The characteristics of the beta-lactamases of 37 strains resistant to P + TZ (MIC greater than 40 micrograms/ml) were studied; 11 were hyperproducers of chromosomic beta-lactamase and 7 produced two types of plasmidic beta-lactamase. The MICs of TZ alone were uniform and high (64-128 micrograms/ml), independently of the characteristics of the strains beta-lactamase. Of 17 strains susceptible to P, the efficacy of P + TZ was significant among carriers of plasmidic beta-lactamase; there was practically no change in the P susceptibility among the non carriers. The efficacy of P + TZ was similar to that of A + AC against E. coli strains; it was higher against strains of Enterobacter, Citrobacter and Serratia.
