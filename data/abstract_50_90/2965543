It has been more than 10 years since PPNG was first diagnosed in Singapore. Since then the prevalence of PPNG has increased progressively, and is now maintained at between 30 to 35% of all gonococcal infections inspite of a decrease in the overall incidence of gonorrhoea in Singapore. PPNG infections have been recorded with all forms of complicated gonorrhoea including pelvic inflammatory disease, ophthalmia and disseminated gonococcal infection. Penicillin alone cannot be used to treat gonorrhoea. The use of antibiotics active against PPNG and NPPNG both in uncomplicated and complicated gonorrhoea as first-line therapy is now essential. The medical cost of treatment of gonorrhoea has increased by 100 to 200% as a result of the emergence of PPNG.
