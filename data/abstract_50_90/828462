The antibiotic sensitivity of 43 strains of Pseudomonas and the minimal inhibitory concentration of mercurial derivatives (5 mineral salts and 4 organics compounds) and of silver nitrate to these microorganisms have been studied. Twelve of these strains were P. aeruginosa of hospital origin, and 31 were Pseudomonas from surface water. Resistance against these inhibitory substances let us to established some connections between the different strains. Some strains were selected to transfer resistance markers by conjugation.
