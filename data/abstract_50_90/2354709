One hundred thirty-one patients of urologists and infectious disease specialists were entered into an open trial of norfloxacin in the therapy of urinary tract infections (UTIs). All patients were evaluable for tolerability and 98 were evaluable for efficacy. The patient population in this study was older (mean age 53 years) and had more underlying urogenital disorders (30%) or recent invasive urologic procedures (20%) than the typical patient population with UTIs. Over 50% of the patients had infections due to organisms other than Escherichia coli, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa (14), Klebsiella pneumoniae (5), Enterobacter spp (3) and Group D streptococcus (6). Clinical and bacteriologic cure rates were 90 and 91%, respectively. Side effects occurred in 5 patients and were generally mild.
