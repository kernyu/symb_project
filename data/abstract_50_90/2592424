Primary cultures of myogenic cells from progressively older embryonic and adult chickens were incubated in medium containing Merocyanine 540 (MC540) and were exposed to white light during the incubation period. After exposure, the cultures were followed to determine cell survival and differentiation. MC540 attached to the surface membranes of all cells. In cultures from 10-day embryos (E10 cells), concentrations of MC540 greater than or equal to 60 micrograms/ml resulted in death of nearly all myogenic cells upon exposure to light, but non-myogenic cells survived and replicated. Below 60 micrograms/ml, there was a dose-dependent reduction in muscle differentiation. At concentrations less than 40 micrograms/ml, there was no effect on myogenesis. Cultures of cells from 18-day (E18) embryos (myogenic stem cells) and from adult muscle (satellite cells) were resistant to doses of MC540 that killed E10 cells. E14 myogenic cell populations contained both resistant and sensitive sub-populations. Terminally differentiated muscle cells were more sensitive to MC540 than precursor cells from any age embryo. Progeny of E18 cells acquired sensitivity to MC540 as differentiation proceeded. In clonal cultures, cells that normally give rise to small muscle clones (committed cells) were selectively destroyed by exposure to the dye. These observations demonstrate that an MC540-resistant myogenic population is present in low numbers in 10-day embryonic pectoral muscle. As development proceeds, this population increases such that, by 18 days of gestation, most of the myogenic cells are resistant to MC540. The results also suggest that embryonic chick myogenic stem cells and adult satellite cells have surface membrane properties which differ from those of their committed progeny.
