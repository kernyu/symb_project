The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of penicillin, tetracycline and spectinomycin was determined for 6 beta-lactamase (PPNG) and 73 non beta-lactamase producing Neisseria gonorrhoeae isolates from Jakarta, Indonesia. All PPNG were resistant to greater than or equal to 128 micrograms/ml penicillin. Forty-six percent of the non-PPNG strains were inhibited by less than or equal to 1.0 microgram/ml of penicillin and 97% by less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml. Most of the PPNG and non-PPNG isolates (90%) were inhibited by less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml tetracycline and less than or equal to 16 micrograms/ml spectinomycin. Two non-PPNG strains were resistant to 64 micrograms/ml of tetracycline, 8 micrograms/ml penicillin and 32 micrograms/ml spectinomycin. The non-PPNG strains generally were more resistant to penicillin and tetracycline compared to strains tested from other parts of the world in previously reported studies.
