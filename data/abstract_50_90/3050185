We have carried out laboratory and clinical studies on rokitamycin (RKM, TMS-19-Q). The results are summarized as follows. Serum and urinary concentrations of RKM were determined in 6 children with ages between 6 and 12 years given single oral doses of 5, 10 and 15 mg/kg. Mean serum concentrations peaked at 30 minutes after administration of 5, 10 and 15 mg/kg, and respective peak values were 0.30 microgram/ml, 0.79 microgram/ml and 1.32 micrograms/ml. Biological half-lives for 5, 10 and 15 mg/kg were 2.0 hours, 1.65 hours and 1.36 hours. The 6-hour urinary recovery ranged from 1.11% to 2.58% after administration of 5 mg/kg, and the mean 6-hour urinary recoveries were 1.35% after administration of 10 mg/kg and 2.28% after administration of 15 mg/kg. Therapeutic responses were recorded as excellent or good in 22 (73.3%) of the children, comprising 6 with tonsillitis, 2 with pharyngitis, 4 with bronchitis, 1 with bronchopneumonia, 1 with Mycoplasma pneumonia, 2 with whooping cough, 5 with streptococcal infections, 5 with Campylobacter enteritis, 3 with impetigo and 1 with SSSS. The microbiological effectiveness of RKM on identified pathogens comprising 4 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, 1 strain of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 6 strains of Streptococcus pyogenes, 4 strains of Haemophilus influenzae and 5 strains of Campylobacter spp. was not so satisfactory as evidenced by a eradication rate of 50.0%. No significant side effect due to the drug was observed in any cases. In conclusion, RKM was found to be efficacious and safe for the treatment of bacterial infections in children.
