The plasmids characterized in Algeria generally belong to the C and F1 me compatibility groups. With the exception of Vibrio cholerae el for the two groups are found in many bacterial species. Plasmids belonging to group C are the only stable in Vibrio cholerae el tor. The possibility that epidemics of Vibrio cholerae el tor carrying C plasmids might be observed, should not be excluded. On the other hand, it is presently impossible to guess what will be the future epidemic plasmid in Salmonella typhi and paratyphi B.
