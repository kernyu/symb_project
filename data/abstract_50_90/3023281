DNA sequence analysis of a portion of an EcoRI fragment of the Bacteroides fragilis R plasmid pBF4 has allowed us to identify the macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B resistance (MLSr) gene, ermF. ermF had a relative moles percent G + C of 32, was 798 base pairs in length, and encoded a protein of approximately 30,360 daltons. Comparison between the deduced amino acid sequence of ermF and six other erm genes from gram-positive bacteria revealed striking homologies among all of these determinants, suggesting a common origin. Based on these and other data, we believe that ermF codes for an rRNA methylase. Analysis of the nucleotide sequences upstream and downstream from the ermF gene revealed the presence of directly repeated sequences, now identified as two copies of the insertion element IS4351. One of these insertion elements was only 26 base pairs from the start codon of ermF and contained the transcriptional start signal for this gene as judged by S1 nuclease mapping experiments. Additional sequence analysis of the 26 base pairs separating ermF and IS4351 disclosed strong similarities between this region and the upstream regulatory control sequences of ermC and ermA (determinants of staphylococcal origin). These results suggested that ermF was not of Bacteroides origin and are discussed in terms of the evolution of ermF and the expression of drug resistance in heterologous hosts.
