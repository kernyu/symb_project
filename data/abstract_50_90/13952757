Two infections due to methicillin-resistant strains of Staph. pyogenes are recorded. Although almost certainly due to the same strain, the infections differed markedly in severity. It is thought that this discrepancy was due to differences in resistance of the hosts. The epidemiological role of methicillin-resistant staphylococci is discussed, and there is evidence that they may on occasion produce extremely severe infections.
