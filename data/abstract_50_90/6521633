A case of multifocal tuberculosis, similar to historic description of the disease is reported in a clear skinned African. Lungs, bones and joints (vertebreae, sternum, os coxae), liver and esophagus were affected by the disease. The low level of resistance found in the patient could explain this dissemination. Generally, prognosis is not compulsorily bad if the germ is sensitive to an additional chemotherapy which needs to be sufficiently prolonged.
