The in vitro antibacterial activity of piperacillin and cefuroxime against 180 isolates of cephalothin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae and of piperacillin against 46 isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was determined. Amikacin, gentamicin, carbenicillin, cefoxitin, and cefamandole were included for comparison. The activities of piperacillin and carbenicillin against Enterobacteriaceae were comparable. Piperacillin was appreciably more active against Pseudomonas than carbenicillin and was equivalent in activity to amikacin on a weight basis. The following beta-lactam agents were the most active against the indicated organisms (in parentheses): cefoxitin (indole-positive Proteus spp.), cefuroxime and cefoxitin, (Klebsiella spp.), piperacillin (Enterobacter spp.), cefuroxime and cefoxitin (E. coli), piperacillin and cefoxitin (Serratia spp.), and cefoxitin (Providencia spp.). Amikacin inhibited 98% of Enterobacteriaceae at clinically achievable serum levels.
