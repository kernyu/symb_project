The resistance of a piliated, transparent variant of Neisseria gonorrhoeae FA19 to intraleukocytic killing by human polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) was examined. In both aerobic and anaerobic PMN monolayers, approximately 2% of the intracellular gonococci survived for as long as 165 min. Anaerobic PMN were as effective as aerobic PMN in the intracellular killing of gonococci. Hence, O2-independent antimicrobial systems of PMN performed a significant role in the intraleukocytic killing of gonococci were intracellular was supported by the elimination of extracellular bacteria by the addition of pyocin 103 and confirmed by the fluorescent antibody staining of intact gonococci after the PMN were permeabilized to antibody with a Formalin-acetone treatment of PMN monolayers. Our data indicate that while the majority of ingested gonococci are killed by O2-independent antimicrobial systems, a small number (about 2%), survive even when care is taken to eliminate extracellular bacteria.
