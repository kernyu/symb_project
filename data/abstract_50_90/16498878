Thirty-three white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) of various ages, both sexes, and in good physical condition were captured for anthelmintic evaluation of six compounds against the large American liver fluke, Fascioloides magna. Based on fluke mortality, hexachlorophene administered at the rate of 12 to 26 mg/kg of body weight was lethal to 5 of 10 mature flukes in seven deer. Nitroxynil at 11 to 24 mg/kg inhibited egg production, but did not kill mature flukes in eight deer. Rafoxanide at 12 to 25 mg/kg killed 6 of 8 (75%) immature flukes in eight deer, but was not effective against 17 mature flukes. Clioxanide at 16 to 38 mg/kg, diamphenethide at 255 to 280 mg/kg, and hexachloroethane at 463 to 629 mg/kg were not effective against F. magna in four, two and four deer, respectively. There was no indication that treatment with fasciolicides at the higher dose rates was more efficacious than at the lower dose rates. Detection of fluke eggs in the feces was a reliable method for diagnosing the presence of mature F. magna in deer prior to treatment, but was not reliable for measuring fasciolicidal activity of all compounds tested.
