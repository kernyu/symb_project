Five horses were anaesthetised twice with thiopentone sodium, guaifenesin and halothane. The second anaesthesia was 16 days after the first and two days following oral administration of trichlorfon. Heart rate, carotid arterial, pulmonary arterial and right atrial pressures, cardiac output and blood temperature were measured every 15 minutes for 120 minutes. Heart rate, carotid arterial pressure and cardiac output were similar on both occasions. Pulmonary arterial and right atrial pressures were highest during anaesthesia after treatment with trichlorfon when compared with values obtained before treatment. Pulmonary vascular resistance was significantly decreased at four measurement times during anaesthesia after treatment with trichlorfon. All cardiovascular measurements were within ranges accepted as normal for halothane anaesthesia in horses. In a second experiment, four ponies were anaesthetised with xylazine and ketamine on two occasions one week apart. Two ponies received trichlorfon two days before the second anaesthesia. Heart rate, arterial pressure and respiratory rate recorded during anaesthesia were not different in ponies after organophosphate treatment. The time to standing after the second anaesthesia was significantly increased in all ponies.
