Blood samples from 77 patients with Plasmodium falciparum malaria resident in the Natal/Kwazulu area, were tested for chloroquine resistance by an in vitro microtechnique; 6 of these patients were infected by asexual parasites which proved resistant in varying degrees to chloroquine. Resistance, expressed in terms of picomoles chloroquine base per well in which schizont development was completely inhibited, ranged from 16 pmol to greater than 24 pmol. On the evidence it would appear likely that these patients were infected during visits to Mozambique or areas immediately bordering Mozambique.
