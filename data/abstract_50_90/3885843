Antibiotic-resistant commensal strains of Neisseria spp. and Branhamella catarrhalis were isolated from throat cultures, on the basis of their capacity to grow in the presence of penicillin, streptomycin, or sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim. Several strains, which belonged to different species of Neisseria, were resistant to beta-lactams, streptomycin, sulfamethoxazole, and trimethoprim, harbored a 6.0-megadalton plasmid with identical HinfI restriction patterns, and produced beta-lactamase and streptomycin phosphotransferase. The resistance determinants for beta-lactams, streptomycin, and sulfamethoxazole, but not for trimethoprim, were transferred from all these strains to Escherichia coli by conjugation or transformation. The resulting transconjugants or transformants acquired the plasmid and the capacity to produce beta-lactamase and streptomycin phosphotransferase. The 6.0-megadalton plasmid complemented a mutation which determines production of thermosensitive dihydropteroate synthetase in E. coli. We conclude that an R plasmid coding for beta-lactamase, streptomycin phosphotransferase, and a sulfonamide-resistant dihydropteroate synthetase is common to these strains.
