Restriction digests of genomic DNA from tunicamycin-resistant Chinese hamster ovary cells, 3E11, were probed with the yeast transferase gene, ALG7. The data presented suggest moderate amplification of the N-acetylglucosaminyl-1-phosphate transferase gene occurred in these cells, consistent with the previously observed chromosomal translocations and increased enzymatic activity. This is the first example of gene amplification as a mechanism for aberrations in N-linked glycosylation.
