DNA fragments generated by the EcoRI of HindIII endonucleases from the low copy number antibiotic resistance plasmids R6 and R6-5 were separately cloned using the high copy number ColE1 or pML21 plasmid vectors and the insertional inactivation procedure. The hybrid plasmids that were obtained were used to determine the location of the EcoRI and HindIII cleavage sites on the parent plasmid genomes by means of electron microscope heteroduplex analysis and agarose gel electrophoresis. Ultracentrifugation of the cloned fragments in caesium chloride gradients localized the high buoyant density regions of R6-5 to fragments that carry the genes for resistance to streptomycin-spectinomycin, sulfonamide, and mercury and a low buoyant density region to fragments that carry the tetracycline resistance determinant. Functional analysis of hybrid plasmids localized a number of plasmid properties such as resistances to antibiotics and mercury and several replication functions to specific regions of the R6-5 genome. Precise localisation of the genes for resistance to chloramphenicol, kanamycin, fusidic acid and tetracycline was possible due to the presence of identified restriction endonuclease cleavage sites within these determinants. Only one region competent for autonomous replication was identified on the R6-5 plasmid genome and this was localized to EcoRI fragment 2 and HindIII fragment 1. However, two additional regions of replication activity designated RepB and RepC, themselves incapable of autonomous replication but capable supporting replication of a linked ColE1 plasmid in polA- bacteria, were also identified.
