A series of N2(and N4)-aryl-N4(and N2)-[(dialkylamino)alkyl]-2,4-quinazolinediamines has been synthesized for antimalarial evaluation. Condensation of the appropriate 2,4-dichloroquinazoline (IV) with the requisite N,N-dialkylalkylenediamine afforded a series of 2-chloro-N-[(dialkylamino)alkyl]-4-quinazolinamines (V) which were condensed with the appropriate arylamine to provide the corresponding N2-aryl-N4-[(dialkylamino)alkyl]-2,4-quinazolinediamines (VI). Hydrolysis of 2,4-dichloroquinazoline to 2-chloro-4-quinazolinol was followed by condensation with the appropriate N,N-dialkylalkylenediamine to give an array of 2-[[(dialkylamino)alkyl]amino]-4-quinazolinols (IXa). Chlorination with phosphorus oxychloride and condensation with a requisite arylamine provided the N2-[(dialkylamino)alkyl]-N4-phenyl-2,4-quinazolinediamines (X). Antimalarial activity was general among the N2-aryl-N4-[(dialkylamino)alkyl]-2,4-quinazolinediamines (VI), while the reverse isomers were of lower activity. Phototoxic liability precluded clinical evaluation of a member of the series.
