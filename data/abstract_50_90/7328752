Laboratory studies of CFX were performed on susceptibility of 123 strains isolated from 72 patients with septicemia by disc sensitivity method in comparison with CER and ABPC. Antibacterial activity of CFX was superior against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Serratia marcescens and Proteus than that of CER and ABPC, especially against Serratia marcescens and Bacteroides which were mostly resistant to CER and ABPC. CFX was administrated to 8 patients with septicemia. Clinical effects were obtained, excellent and good in 5 patients and poor in 3, and effective rate was 63%. No side effects were observed. The above results indicate that CFX is mainly useful in the treatment of infections caused by Gram-negative bacilli, especially resistant to penicillins, cephalosporins, and Bacteroides.
