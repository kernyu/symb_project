A novel beta-lactamase has been identified in an Escherichia coli strain isolated in South India. The beta-lactamase gene was carried on a plasmid (pUK734) along with resistance determinants to sulphonamides and tetracycline. The novel enzyme has a pI of 8.3 and an Mr of 36,000. The enzyme has a broad-spectrum of activity against both penicillins and cephalosporins. It is also active against oxacillin and methicillin.
