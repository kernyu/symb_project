Solubilization of rat synaptic membranes by Triton X-100 followed by DEAE-cellulose chromatography allowed the separation of a phosphoramidon-sensitive endopeptidase that cleaved CCK-8. This enzymatic activity revealed similar if not identical to "enkephalinase A." A major cleavage point, at the Trp30-Met31 bond, and a minor one at the Tyr27-Met28 bond were identified in the sequence of CCK-8. Replacements of the Met28 and Met31 residues by Thr and either Leu or Nle respectively, in CCK-9 analogues, did not improve the resistance of these peptides to enzymatic degradation. The regional distribution in rat brain of this CCK-8 cleaving endopeptidase displayed marked variations with the highest activity in striatal membranes; it closely followed that described for "enkephalinase" in mouse brain.
