Spectrum of antibacterial activity, pharmacokinetics, adverse effects, dosage and therapeutic uses of newer cephalosporins are reviewed, following data of the most recent international works. AA. think that advantages of the new compounds in comparison with previous cephalosporins, are not so important that might modify their opinion on the role of cephalosporins in therapy: cephalosporins are useful, effective and safe chemotherapeutic agents, but all are overused and, only exceptionally, they could be claimed as a first choice antibiotics. Attempts should be made to define the precise indications for the use of the several members of the group before deciding which are really necessary, when it is really necessary. Newer cephalosporins should be reserved for situations in which they may be preferred to others chemo-antibiotics because of their relative safety or because of organism resistance to better established drugs. The present newer cephalosporins are generally effective when used wisely, in hospitalised patients, but therapy will often be significantly more expensive than a current chemo-antibiotic treatment.
