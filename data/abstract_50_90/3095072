Transferable resistance to classical Cephalosporins emerged three years ago among Enterobacteriaceae simultaneously in several hospitals and was associated with resistance to other betalactam drugs, i.e. with a transmissible TEM-like betalactamase. A systematic survey of incidence of R plasmids in Proteus sp. lead, in two district PHLs, to demonstration of transferable Azlocillin resistance. This resistance was most frequently associated with that for Carbenicillin, but also strains susceptible to CAR but resistant to AZL have been isolated. Trimethoprim resistance was in this country first described by Schon, but, since then, it is now frequently found transferable in polyresistant strains from hospitals, resistant also to betalactam antibiotics, Gentamicin and other drugs.
