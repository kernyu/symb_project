Acute dysentery and other acute intestinal diseases with obscure etiology are accompanied by pronounced intestinal dysbacteriosis which is manifested, on one hand, by the increased levels of Escherichia, enterobacteria, staphylococci and by the appearance of Klebsiella and Proteus in large amounts and, on the other hand, by an essential decrease in the number of lactic acid streptococci, lactobacteria, bifidobacteria. The treatment of dysentery and other intestinal diseases with obscure etiology with antibiotics, while eliminating the infective agent, leads to the aggravation of intestinal dysbacteriosis. The combined use of antibiotics and antibiotic-resistant bifidobacteria in intestinal infections with obscure etiology contributes to the effective restoration of normal intestinal microflora already in the process of antibiotic therapy.
