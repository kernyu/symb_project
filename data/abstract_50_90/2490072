Silver toxicity to Pseudomonas stutzeri AG259 was strongly dependent on the NaCl concentration in the medium, which reduced the availability of Ag+ by precipitation as AgCl. Accumulation of Ag by growing cultures was low being less than or equal to 7.5 nmol (mg dry mass)-1 over all treatments examined. The presence of NaCl in the growth medium did not markedly affect the amounts of Ag accumulated by the cells but influenced toxicity as manifest by a lag period which was greatest at low NaCl concentrations (less than or equal to 0.1% mass/vol.). In NaCl-free medium, P. stutzeri did not grow in the presence of 0.5 mM AgNO3 in contrast to Ag-free controls. The majority of Ag accumulation by resting cells of P. stutzeri occurred within 1 min of incubation and there was little difference in uptake capacities between cells previously grown in the absence or presence of AgNO3. Lowest amounts of Ag uptake by resting cells occurred when suspended in 1 mM Mes pH 6.5, containing 1% (mass/vol.) NaCl. Prior exposure of P. stutzeri to Cu(NO3)2 resulted in a marked reduction in Ag uptake when suspended in 1 mM Mes pH 6.5, containing 0.5 mM AgNO3.
