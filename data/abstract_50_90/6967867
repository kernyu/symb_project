Arg mutants, isolated from Streptomyces lavendulae at unusually high frequencies, showed several phenotypic characteristics. The characteristics common to all arg mutants include: (1) repression of beta-lactamase production, (2) inhibition of aerial mycelium formation, (3) development of acid pH, (4) low saturation density of growth in liquid culture, (5) a decrease in antibiotic production, (6) an increase in sensitivity to benzylpenicillin and (7) a decrease in production of pigment. These results suggest that the arg mutation concomitantly caused the depression of secondary metabolism in S. lavendulae.
