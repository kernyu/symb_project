Variation diagrams were proposed to be used for the analysis of the published data on the study of Vibrio cholerae sensitivity to tetracycline. The diagrams provided systematization of dissimilar data of the experimental studies and a unique system of estimation was created. The analysis of the systematized data provided dividing of the Vibrio cholerae strains tested into 4 groups differing in the levels of their sensitivity to tetracycline. The groups were independent of the Vibrio cholerae biotypes and the place and period of the strain isolation.
