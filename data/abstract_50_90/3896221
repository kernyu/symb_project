Eleven isolates of H2S-producing Escherichia coli were recovered from necropsy materials of chickens with symptoms and lesions of colisepticemia on Saudi Arabian broiler farms. Results of 19 out of 20 biochemical reactions studied were typical for E. coli. Hydrogen sulfide production by the E. coli isolates was used as an epidemiological marker to pinpoint a breeding farm as the probable source of these strains, which were then transferred to progeny farms, where colisepticemia occurred. This finding was confirmed by the presence of the same antigenic structure (O78:H-) and by the same drug-resistance pattern (a multiple resistance to streptomycin, sulfathiazole, and tetracycline) in the isolates.
