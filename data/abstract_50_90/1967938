Much evidence suggests that P-glycoprotein (P-gp) confers multidrug-resistance (MDR) in tumor cells by energy-dependent efflux of hydrophobic cytotoxic agents. In this study, we have used the alpha 1-adrenergic photoaffinity probe, [125I]arylazidoprazosin ([125I]AAP), and identified P-gp as a specific acceptor for prazosin. Drugs to which MDR cells are resistant, including vincristine, vinblastine, doxorubicin, actinomycin D and colchicine as well as agents reversing MDR, including verapamil, nicardipine, prenylamine, diltiazem, trifluoperazine, dibucaine, reserpine, monensin, and progesterone, differentially reduced [125I]AAP photolabeling of P-gp. We also analyzed the influence of alpha 2-adrenergic drugs and dopaminergic drugs on [125I]AAP photolabeling of P-gp. Limited proteolysis of [125I]AAP photolabeled P-gp with Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease revealed that prazosin binds to a single 8 kDa fragment of P-gp.
