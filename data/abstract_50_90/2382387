Following reports of suspected gastrointestinal strongylid nematode resistance to thiophanate in sheep and goats at Sokoine University of Agriculture (SUA), Tanzania, field strains of Haemonchus contortus, one from SUA and another from Kimamba, Tanzania, were selected for a critical controlled test to evaluate the efficacy of thiophanate. The SUA H. contortus strain in goats showed a marked resistance to thiophanate at an oral dose of 50 mg kg-1 liveweight (efficacy = 24.1%), while the Kimamba H. contortus strain showed very marked susceptibility (efficacy = 99.7%) to thiophanate at the same oral dose. This is the first report from East Africa of a field strain of H. contortus resistant to thiophanate. The incidence of resistant strains of strongyloid parasites to benzimidazole anthelmintics in sheep and goats in East Africa is on the increase. The magnitude of this problem should be evaluated and remedial solutions sought.
