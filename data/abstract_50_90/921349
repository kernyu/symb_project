When appropriate culture techniques are employed, Bacteroides bacteremia is found more frequently than might be expected and usually follows contamination from the gastrointestinal or genitourinary tracts. Survival is closely related to the extent of organ impiarment preceding the bacteremia. Proper therapy is based on early recognition of the source of bacteremia and adequate surgical drainage. Antibiotics do not appear to improve survival, particularly when used without drainage. Further studies are needed to identify patients with impaired host resistance who are particularly susceptible to these organisms.
