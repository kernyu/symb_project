Escherichia coli strains isolated from clinically healthy and sick animals in Lagos and Oyo States of Nigeria were tested for drug resistance and distribution of R-factors. Fifteen multiple and 3 single (OT, S, S3) antibiotic resistance patterns were obtained among 333 isolates. Of the 285 resistant strains, 133 transfered their resistant determinant to sensitive E. coli K 12 recipients in part or as a block. None of the donors had sex pili and they were not lysed by Ms2 phage. It required about 2 h for E. coli K 12 to acquire a resistance determinant from E. coli strains Nos. 295, 62 and 67 habouring resistance to oxytetracycline, streptomycin and compound of sulphonamides (S3). The number of recipient cells that formed transconjugants increased with the time of incubation.
