A strain of the cecal coccidian of chickens, Eimeria tenella, was propagated serially in chickens fed mash containing amprolium, nicarbazin, Unistat, or zoalene. Each group of chickens received a different coccidiostat on a rotating basis. The strain was propagated through 40 groups of chickens; thus, the strain was intermittently exposed 10 times to each coccidiostat. The end product of this simulated shuttle program of prophylactic anticoccidial medication was a strain resistant to three of the four coccidiostats involved. Resistance to nicarbazin was not evident.
