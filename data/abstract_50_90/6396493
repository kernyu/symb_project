The mutagenic activity of ozone was investigated by the isolation of streptomycin-resistant mutants (Smr) in different strains of Escherichia coli. RecA, lexA, polA and parental strains were ozonated and streptomycin-resistant mutants were scored after a short or long phenotypic delay. Our results suggest that ozone is an active mutagen for forward mutation and that this oxidizing agent could be able to induce mutations via two mechanisms: directly and indirectly by the rec-lex error-prone repair system.
