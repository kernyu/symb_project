Niridazole was shown to be an effective chemotherapeutic agent for mice infected intravenously with a niridazole-sensitive strain of Salmonella typhimurium. Death rates as well as bacterial counts per spleen were reduced, even in compromised animals. Histologic examination of spleens proved the reduction of inflammatory reaction due to Salmonella infection. A suppressive effect of niridazole treatment on immunity to challenge infection with S. typhimurium was not found, as demonstrated by infection with a niridazole-resistant strain of S. typhimurium.
