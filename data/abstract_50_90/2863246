The activity of Sch 34343 was determined against 575 strains of anaerobic bacteria by an agar-dilution method. Its activity was compared with that of benzylpenicillin, piperacillin, cefoxitin, imipenem, clindamycin, metronidazole, chloramphenicol, vancomycin, fusidic acid and bacitracin. Sch 34343 and imipenem were the most active agents tested. Based on these results, Sch 34343 appears to be a promising antimicrobial agent for anaerobic infections and warrants further clinical investigations.
