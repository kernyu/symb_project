The Haemophilus influenzae R plasmids specifying resistance against one, two, or three antibiotics which have emerged in different parts of the world were shown to have closely related but not identical plasmid cores. The gene for ampicillin resistance in the H. influenzae plasmid pKRE5367 is part of a transposon similar to Tn3, which was transposed from pKRE5367 onto RSF1010 in Escherichia coli. An indigenous H. influenzae plasmid (pW266) was isolated. Its properties correspond to those of the H. influenzae R plasmids, except for the presence of a drug resistance transposon. The in vitro-generated H. influenzae R plasmids carrying an ampicillin resistance transposon, a tetracycline resistance transposon, and a transposon for combined tetracycline-chloramphenicol resistance resembled the natural isolates. The findings support the hypothesis that the R plasmids of H. influenzae are of multiclonal evolutionary origin.
