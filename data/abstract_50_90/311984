290 natural isolates of Aeromonas, Plesiomonas and Vibrio strains isolated from surface waters have been tested for antibiotic resistance, and 123 have been found resistant to various drugs, mostly beta-lactam antibiotics. 14 of them, with high-level of resistances, transfered antibiotic resistance using three recipient strains of Enterobacteriaceae. One strain of Vibrio NAG (Heiberg II) transfered the resistance to ampicillin, carbenicillin and cephaloridin to both E. coli K12 3110 and S. typhimurium LT2 recipient, and further, in the second cycle of transfer, to E. coli K12 185 Nx strain. One additional strain of Aeromonas hydrophyla transfered a high-level ampicillin- and a low-level gentamicin resistance to E. coli K12 3110 only. Here, the resistances could not be transfered in the second cycle, and, they did not occur in the same exconjugant colony. This confirms previous reports that antibiotic resistance is widely distributed among strains found in wild nature.
