The clinical symptoms associated with coagulase-negative staphylococcal bacteraemia in infants on a Special Care Baby Unit were investigated. They were compared with those of blood culture-negative controls matched for age and weight. Infants with positive cultures were further sub-divided by judging the isolate to be a contaminant or a pathogen. There was a high incidence of respiratory symptoms in the latter patients, particularly in infants of less than 37 weeks gestation. These symptoms often responded to antimicrobial chemotherapy, particularly in infants given correct antibiotics, as demonstrated by laboratory sensitivity testing. Bacteraemia was usually detected shortly after starting mechanical ventilation, and may be its consequence in premature infants. Gentamicin-resistance occurred in over 50 per cent of blood culture isolates of coagulase-negative staphylococci. We postulate that coagulase-negative staphylococci can be a neonatal pathogen requiring appropriate antimicrobial chemotherapy.
