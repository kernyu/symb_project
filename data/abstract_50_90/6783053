The present study was designed to examine the osmotic resistance of erythrocytes measured by a new method-Coil Planet Centrifuge under the glutaraldehyde incubation, and to determine free cholesterol and adenine nucleotide contents of glutaraldehyde-treated erythrocytes compared with that of control erythrocytes. Glutaraldehyde increased the osmotic resistance of erythrocytes. Hemolysis end point of glutaraldehyde-treated erythrocytes shifted to hypo-osmolar side after 2.5 h hours incubation (p less than 0.001). Free cholesterol content of erythrocytes was not changed by the addition of glutaraldehyde, however, ATP content significantly increased when compared with controls (p less than 0.001). Moreover, the osmotic resistance of erythrocytes in 55 patients with alcoholic liver injuries and the relation between the disease were examined by Coil Planet Centrifuge. Hemolysis end point shifted to hypo-osmolar side in the patients, and our results suggest that the increase in osmotic resistance is partly responsible for the increase in the rigidity of erythrocytes. This new method was also helpful in evaluation in the clinical course of alcoholic liver injuries.
