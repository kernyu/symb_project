A method has been developed to isolate mutants sensitive to coliphage P1 from bacterial genera normally not sensitive to this phage. P1clr100KM was used. This phage is heat inducible and confers kanamycin resistance when present as a prophage (in lysogens). P1-sensitive mutants of Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Citrobacter, and Erwinia have been found. This technique provides a well-known genetic system for the study of many bacterial genera that previously had either no such system or only a marginally useful means of genetic manipulation. It also extends the range of possible intergeneric hybrids that may be constructed and studied.
