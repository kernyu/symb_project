Ribosomes, radioactively labelled in vivo with both [1-14C]methionine and [methyl-3H]methionine, have been isolated from both wild-type and thiostrepton-resistant strains of Bacillus megaterium and their constituent proteins separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Ribosomes from the wild-type strain possess one basic protein that is extensively methylated. In contrast no such protein can be detected in ribosomes from the thiostrepton-resistant strain.
