Acyclovir (Aciclovir), previously known as acycloguanosine, has been found to be a potent and selective inhibitor of viruses of the herpes group. A clear therapeutic effect has been demonstrated in animals and in clinical studies, especially for herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection of the eye. Various reports indicate that acyclovir is as effective as or superior to other available antiviral agents with low host toxicity and mild side effects. The possibility of systemic use of this drug and the effect on HSV latency are encouraging, although more evaluation is needed. Acyclovir is a promising new antiviral agent for the topical treatment of HSV ocular infection.
