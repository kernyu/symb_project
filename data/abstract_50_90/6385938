Eikenella corrodens is a gram-negative, facultative anaerobe that exists as part of the normal oral flora. Its role as a pathogen in human infection has been disputed, but recently its pathogenic potential has been increasingly recognized. A review of the literature reveals the emergence of this organism as a pathogen in human infection. Specific microbiologic characteristics of this organism make it difficult to isolate and evaluate for antibiotic sensitivities. Infections produced by this bacteria are characteristically indolent in nature and are usually associated with oral contamination. Appropriate antibiotic therapy utilizes ampicillin or penicillin. Tetracycline is the drug of choice in the penicillin-allergic patient. Clindamycin resistance is a universal feature. A greater awareness of the pathogenic potential of E corrodens is essential for appropriate recognition and treatment.
