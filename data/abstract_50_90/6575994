Aqueous solutions of eugenol depressed vasoconstrictor responses to exogenous norepinephrine (NE), histamine, and peri-arterial sympathetic nerve stimulation in the isolated central artery of the rabbit ear and in the isolated perfused whole rabbit ear. The depression was dose- and time-dependent, and was slowly reversible. Eugenol appeared to act as an inhibitor of smooth muscle contractility.
