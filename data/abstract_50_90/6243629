Two closely linked genes, mrdA and mrdB, located at ca. 14.2 min on the Escherichia coli chromosomal linkage map, seen to be responsible for the normal rod shape and mecillinam sensitivity of E. coli. The product of mrdA was concluded to be penicillin-binding protein 2, because mrdA mutations caused formation of thermosensitive penicillin-binding protein 2. The product of the mrdB gene is unknown. At 42 degrees, C, mutation in either of these genes caused formation of spherical cells and mecillinam resistance. Both mutations was recessive, and complementation, as detected in +-/-+ meroheterodiploids having the wild-type phenotype, provided strong evidence that the two mutations are in different complementation groups. P1 transduction suggested that the most plausible gene order is leuS-mrdA-mrdB-lip. The rodA mutation reported previously seems to be similar to the mrdB murations, but the identities of the two have not yet been proven.
