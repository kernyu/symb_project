Plasmids, which code for a new type of drug resistance due to the acetylation of streptothricin and belonging to various incompatibility groups (I1, I2, W3, FII, S, X, and N) were identified in gram-negative bacteria. The gene for the acetyltransferase is closely linked to a gene for the streptomycin/spectinomycin adenylyltransferase AAD-3" on a novel type of a transposon, designated Tn1825. This is related to Tn7.
