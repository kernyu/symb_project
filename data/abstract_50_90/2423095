Interferons are endogenous antiviral agents which mediate the early defense of the organism against virus infection. The target of interferons is the cell rather than the virus itself. Through binding to specific receptors on the cell surface and subsequent activation of specific genes interferons induce an antiviral state which makes cells less permissive for virus replication. The antiviral state is composed of various antiviral mechanisms which seem to act independently and show some specificity for different viruses. Translational control affecting viral protein synthesis may be the most common mechanism through which virus is inhibited. There is evidence that antiviral and antigrowth activities of interferons share similar mechanisms.
