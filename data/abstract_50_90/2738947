Two hundred fourteen isolates from clinical specimens were tested in vitro to determine their susceptibility pattern against norfloxacin. Of the 151 strains of gram-negative bacteria tested, 149 (98.7%) were susceptible. Sixty-three (100%) of the gram-positive bacteria tested were also susceptible to norfloxacin. Norfloxacin showed excellent activity against all bacteria isolated from urine.
