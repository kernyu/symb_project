Ten strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were disrupted and centrifuged. The supernatant fluids from centrifugation at 105,000 x g contained enzymes inactivating kanamycin, neomycin, and streptomycin in the presence of adenosine triphosphate. Kanamycin-inactivating enzyme was precipitated with ammonium sulfate at 66% of saturated concentration, and the inactivated kanamycin was shown to be kanamycin-3'-phosphate in which the C-3 hydroxyl group of 6-amino-6-deoxy-d-glucose moiety was phosphorylated. This is identical with kanamycin inactivated by Escherichia coli carrying R factor. Streptomycin-inactivating enzyme was precipitated with ammonium sulfate at 33% of saturated concentration.
