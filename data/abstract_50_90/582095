The molecular properties of the plasmids of a natural isolate of Salmonella panama have been studied. This strain, Sp477, harbours 5 different plasmids: the conjugative plasmid pRI477TF (molecular weight 20 megadaltons), the two non-conjugative plasmids, pRI477A and pRI477S, coding for ampicillin and streptomycin plus sulfonamide resistance respectively (molecular weights of both 5.6 megadaltons) and two cryptic plasmids with molecular weights of 1.0 and 2.7, megadaltons respectively. After conjugal transfer to Escherichia coli the ampicillin resistance determinant was frequently found to be integrated into pRI477TF or pRI477S. The translocatable sequence on pRI477A, designated as Tn901, resembles the TnA sublcass transposon TnA(1).
