A novel carbenicillin-hydrolyzing beta-lactamase has been discovered in a blood isolate of Aeromonas hydrophila. The enzyme resembles plasmid-determined carbenicillinases in substrate profile but differs in isoelectric point (pI 5.9) and molecular weight (22,000) and has been termed AER-1. No evidence for a plasmid location could be obtained in A. hydrophila, but the AER-1 gene and resistance to chloramphenicol, streptomycin, and sulfonamide could be transferred by mobilization with IncP plasmids to Escherichia coli, where the gene cluster inserted at a unique chromosomal site. The linked resistances are similar to those found on multiresistance beta-lactamase transposons, but since insertion of the A. hydrophila gene cluster was site specific and recA+ dependent, the cluster is not a functional transposon.
