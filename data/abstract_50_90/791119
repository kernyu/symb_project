Composition of the culture medium, growth phase, and temperature play important roles in the sensitivity of Escherichia coli to H2O2. The medium and growth phase affected the sensitivity of the cells to H2O2 by modifying the amount of catalase synthesized by them, whereas the effect of temperature was due to the thermolability of the enzyme. Since catalase is unstable in the presence of its substrate, the correlation between the catalase level in the cells and their sensitivity to H2O2 could be observed only when the H2O2 concentration was not excessive in proportion to the amount of catalase.
