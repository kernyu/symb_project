A mutation in the ilvU locus of Escherichia coli has led to a complex phenotype that included resistance to thiaisoleucine, a loss of derepressibility of isoleucyl tRNA synthetase, and an alteration of the RPC-5 chromatographic profile of the branched-chain aminoacyl-tRNA's. The alterations were manifest in an increase in the amount of Species 2 of both tRNAIle and tRNAVal at the expense of Species 1. A similar alteration, but independent of (and additive to) that caused by the ilvU mutation, was observed upon limitation of either isoleucine or valine. The shift in profile caused by limitation was also independent of the reduced growth rate or the derepression of the isoleucine and valine biosynthetic enzymes that also result from limitation. During chloramphenicol treatment nearly all tRNAIle and tRNAVal formed appears as species 2. Upon recovery from chloramphenicol, Species 2 of both acceptors are converted to Species 1. It is proposed that the ilvU product not only allows derepression of isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase but also retards the conversion of tRNA2Ile to tRNA1Ile and that of tRNA2Val to tRNA1Val. The mutated ilvU loci abolish the derepression and are more efficient in retarding the conversion.
