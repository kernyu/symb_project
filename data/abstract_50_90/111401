Resistance to selected antibiotics was studied in 325 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, isolated from foodstuffs. Out of these strains, 50.46% were resistant to penicillin, 15.7% to ampicillin, 4% to streptomycin, 5.2% to erythromycin, 5.8% to chloramphenicol, 18.5% to tetracycline, 18.2% to oxytetracycline, 2.5% to gentamycin, 1.6% to canamycin, 53.5% to colistine and 9.2% to bacitracin. Eighty-five strains (26.15%) were sensitive to all the antibiotics used; 107 strains (32.92%) were resistant to one antibiotic, and 133 strains (40.93%) to two or more antibiotics.
