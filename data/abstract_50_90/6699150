The API 20S system (Analytab Products, Plainview, N.Y.) was evaluated for the rapid identification of multiply antibiotic-resistant aerobic diphtheroids. Sixty-eight clinical isolates of multiply resistant Centers for Disease Control group JK and group D2 corynebacteria had API 20S profiles which were clearly different from those of a number of strains of other Corynebacterium species which were tested. The API 20S system allowed more rapid identification of antibiotic-resistant diphtheroids than conventional biochemical tests. Its use for corynebacteria other than group JK and group D2 is not recommended at this time.
