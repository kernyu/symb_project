Isolates of Microsporum canis, Microsporum gypseum and Epidermophyton floccosum were observed to produce antibacterial activities under cross-resistance to fusidic acid. The activity from E. floccosum was shown to be due to fusidic acid, diketofusidic acid and 3-ketofusidic acid. Possible contributions of these antibiotics to microbial interaction during dermatophytosis is discussed.
