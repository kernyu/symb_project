In Chinese hamster ovary cells, [3H]formycin B is metabolized into formycin B-5'-monophosphate, formycin A-5'-monophosphate and higher phosphorylated derivatives of formycin A which are incorporated into RNA. Mutants of CHO cells independently selected for resistance to various adenosine analogs viz. toyocamycin, tubercidin, 6-methylmercaptopurine riboside, which contain no detectable activity of adenosine kinase (AK) in cell extracts, all exhibited between 2- to 3-fold increased resistance to formycin B. Formycin B-resistant mutants of CHO cells are also affected in AK, as indicated by the absence of AK activity in cell extracts. Both types of AK- mutants showed reduced uptake and phosphorylation of [3H]formycin B in comparison to the parental (AK+) cells. In addition, toxicity of formycin B towards CHO cells was reduced in presence of adenosine in a concentration dependent manner. These observations strongly indicate that in CHO cells, formycin B is phosphorylated via AK and that like other nucleoside analogs its phosphorylation may be essential for the drugs cellular toxicity.
