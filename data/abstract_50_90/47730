The main characteristics of Mycoplasma ulcerans are its remarkably distinct drug sensitivity pattern and its rather poor enzymatic activity. M. microti is clearly distinguishable from M. bovis and M. tuberculosis. Some of the M. buruli strains appear to be identical with M. ulcerans, Whereas others show similarity either to M. microti or to M. tuberculosis. It seems that M. buruli is not a legitimate species.
