Group H streptococci (strain Challis) which are competent for transformation release a bacteriocin into liquid medium which is bacteriocidal for another group H streptococcus (strain Wicky). The streptocin (STH(1)) is resistant to treatment with deoxyribonuclease and ribonuclease but is sensitive to trypsin, phospholipase C, and alkaline phosphatase. Such enzyme sensitivity experiments indicate that the bacteriocin may be a complex molecule (protein and lipid) containing phosphate groups essential for activity. STH(1), which is readily distinguishable from competence factor and bacteriophage activity, appears to have no role in the initiation of the competent state in strain Wicky. The presence of this factor in Challis culture supernatant fluids indicates that a reevaluation of earlier studies performed with the Challis-Wicky transformation system may be necessary.
