Frequency of isolation and antibiotic susceptibility of E. coli strains isolated from urinary tract infections in private laboratory. The urinary tract infections are not the most frequent infections in man. However cytobacteriological analysis are often required for the diagnosis. The critical evaluation of 3000 analysis brings the followed conclusions: 1) 16% of the analysis correspond to a urinary tract infection; 2) the most frequently isolated germs are E. coli (65%) and Proteus mirabilis (11%); 3) E. coli is always very susceptible to antibiotics especially aminosides (100%) polymyxine E (92%), cotrimoxazole (91%) and quinolones (90%); 4) hospital bacteria can be found with a low frequency. However, in our study, Staphylococcus aureus has been isolated in 6% of the cases. This seems to be in relation with the passage of patients in an obstetric clinic.
