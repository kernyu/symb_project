Oxytetracycline resistant mutants of Aeromonas salmonicida isolated from mutation frequency experiments showed decreased susceptibility to oxolinic acid. Outer membrane preparations of these resistant mutant strains revealed a major protein, with a molecular mass of approximately 37 kDa, which was not present in significant quantities in the parent strain.
