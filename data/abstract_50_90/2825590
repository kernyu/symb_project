During studies of the antiviral activity of chalcone Ro-09-0410 on human rhinovirus type 9 (RV9) chalcone-resistant strains of RV9 were isolated and appeared with a frequency of about 10(-5) in chalcone sensitive stock. Chalcone-dependent viruses were found after further passage. Some characteristics of the resistant viruses were studied and compared with those of the wild type virus; a number of differences were detected. They produced smaller plaques and grew to lower titre; they were no longer protected by chalcone from inactivation by heat and low pH. The event responsible for drug dependence apparently took place after that responsible for drug resistance. Drug-resistant viruses were still sensitive to dichloroflavan and enviroxime.
