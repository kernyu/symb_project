The complete nucleotide sequence of the hemagglutinin (HA) gene of the human type B influenza virus B/Singapore/222/79 is presented. Comparison with the only other known sequence of a B hemagglutinin (B/Lee/40) shows that antigenic drift in type B HA genes is essentially the same as already observed within the influenza A H3 subtype, i.e., an accumulation of point mutations. The main difference is that the apparent evolution is significantly slower, most likely due to the cumulative effect of a lower occurrence in the population (slower evolution) and/or less immunological pressure. There is a striking cluster of changes at positions 127 until 137 of the HA1 subunit which may represent one of the antigenic sites of the molecule.
