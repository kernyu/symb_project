131 strains of E. coli isolated from coliform mastitis were examined for susceptibility to 8 antibiotics. Colistin, gentamycin, and polymyxin B were the most active drugs based upon MIC determination. In milk, ampicillin showed the highest bactericidal activity followed by polymyxin B and colistin. All strains examined were sensitive to colistin, gentamycin, and polymyxin B.
