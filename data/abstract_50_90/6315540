A cloning vehicle, pFTB91, for the Bacillus subtilis host was constructed with DNA fragments heterologous to the host chromosome. It consists of three DNA fragments: (i) chromosomal DNA of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens which complements the leuA and ilvC mutations in B. subtilis; (ii) a B. amyloliquefaciens plasmid DNA that supplies an autonomously replicating function; and (iii) a HindIII fragment of Staphylococcus aureus plasmid pTP5 that carries gene tetr, conferring the TetR phenotype. It has sufficiently low DNA homology to prevent its integration into the host chromosome in recombination-competent cells of B. subtilis. It is 9.3 kb, and approx. 10 copies are present per chromosome. The SalI and KpnI sites in the ilvC+ and tetr genes, respectively, could be used for selection of recombinant plasmids by insertional inactivation. The plasmid has unique sites for EcoRI, PstI, and XbaI.
