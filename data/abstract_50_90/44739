Between 1969 and 1978 at the CHR of Nantes we isolated Streptococcus pneumoniae from 815 swabs taken from 591 patients and which provided 595 different strains. Serotyping of all the strains was carried out using the capsular reaction test. The prevalence of the different serovars varied according to the year and the type of swab. No resistant strains to benzylpenicillin or ampicillin were observed. There was significant resistance to sulphonamides and tetracycline : 24,3 and 29,6% respectively. The American vaccine containing the greatest number of serovars was effective for only 69,8% of the strains isolated in Nantes.
