Cultures of Staphylococcus aureus showing unstable resistance to kanamycin, streptomycin, lincomycin and penicillin have been preserved by drying. Particular attention has been paid to organisms showing linked resistance to pairs of these antibiotics. Recoveries of viable cells from the desiccates was high and the proportion of resistant and sensitive cells was maintained both during storage and during heating. The preservation of the organisms on ceramic beads stored in air over silica gel promises to be an effective and convenient method for maintaining staphylococcal desiccates during studies of unstable antibiotic resistance.
