Currently, infections caused by MRSA (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) pose a great problem clinically. We present 4 patients with MRSA infections experienced by us. In these patients the infection was localized in the trachea and main bronchus. The first patient was a 62-year-old man. After undergoing operation for early gastric cancer, he had septic shock and was admitted to our center. The second was a 60-year-old man. After he underwent operation for advanced gastric carcinoma at another hospital septicemia developed due to suture failure and he was admitted to our center. The third was a 38-year-old woman who was admitted to our center because of grades II degrees-III degrees burns on 75 to 80% of her body surface area. The fourth was a 60-year-old man who was admitted to our center because of rupture of an aneurysm of the abdominal aorta. It is assumed that MRSA has quite different characteristics from the usual MSSA (methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus) in that it produces a new penicillin-bound protein (PBP-2') within cells. Thus, from the fiberoptic bronchoscopy findings of our own cases it is considered that there may be cases in which the observed lesion is localized in the central airway alone, without involvement of the segmental bronchi. We believe it necessary to take some prompt measures under a suspicion of airway infection caused by MRSA in the following cases: (1) compromised hosts under tracheal intubation, (2) patients who are under treatment with second or third generation cephalosporins, and (3) patients with production of bloody sputum, and (4) endotoxin-positive patients.
