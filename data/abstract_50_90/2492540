Since January 1988, Staphylococcus aureus strains with a high level of quinolone resistance have been isolated at 17 hospitals and 15 nursing homes in New York City. The majority of these strains were methicillin resistant. The bacteriophage types and susceptibility to other antibiotics were similar to those of quinolone-susceptible strains isolated at the same hospitals.
