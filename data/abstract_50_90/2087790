Results of the comparative study of trypsin- and chymotrypsin-like serine proteases from pyloric caeca of salmon fishes and trypsin and chymotrypsin of bulls are presented in the paper. The hydrolytic activity of salmon proteases with respect to methyl ethers of N-benzoyl-L-leucine is 2.4 times higher than that of bull chymotrypsin, but with respect to methyl esters of N-benzoyl-L-tyrosine and N-benzoyl-L-arginine the activity of salmon proteases is 6.5 and 80 times lower than that of bull chymotrypsin and trypsin. Salmon proteases in contrast to bull trypsin and chymotrypsin hydrolyze but slightly N-glutaryl-L-phenylalanine para-nitroanilide. It shown that fish proteases are not absolutely specific to synthetic substrates, which is a result of their less pronounced (than in case of bull trypsin and chymotrypsin) differences in structures of binding centres. The study of the salmon protease interaction with some immobilized ligands has confirmed the higher affinity of enzymes to reagents with two space-separated aromatic rings in their composition. It is supposed that salmon proteases interact with such reagents through two sites: hydrophobic "pockets" and probably additional binding site of the active centre. The salmon protease preparation demonstrates higher resistance to inactivating action of formaldehyde within the range of concentrations 2-16% than bull chymotrypsin does.
