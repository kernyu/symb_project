The affinity levels of sterols in the sensitive and resistant cultures of C. albicans for polyenic antibiotics were studied comparatively. The affinity level was determined by liberation of potassium under the effect of the antibiotic participating in interaction with the sterol. The protective effect of the sterol suspended in solution and included into the composition of the liposomes from egg lecithin was studied. It was found that the sterols of the resistant cultures of C. albicans had the same (or even somewhat higher) affinity to amphotericin B as those from the sensitive cultures. The data indicate that resistance of the strains studied is not based on the loss of the sterol capacity for binding polyenic antibiotics.
