Twenty isolates of Prototheca filamenta, Prototheca moriformis, Prototheca stagnora, Prototheca wickerhamii, and Prototheca zopfii were tested for in vitro susceptibility to five commonly used antifungal agents: amphotericin B, 5-fluorocytosine, griseofulvin, miconazole, and nystatin. The results revealed resistance to griseofulvin of all the Prototheca isolates tested and an inhibitory effect on P. filamenta by high 5-fluorocytosine concentrations (minimal inhibitory concentration [MIC] = 12.5 to 100 mug/ml; minimal fungicidal or algacidal concentration [MFC/MAC] = 50 to 100 mug/ml). P. filamenta isolates were also susceptible to miconazole (MIC = 0.1 to 0.5 mug/ml, MFC/MAC = 0.5 to 1 mug/ml); isolates of the other Prototheca species varied in regard to miconazole activity from susceptible to resistant (MIC = 1 - >100 mug/ml, MFC/MAC = 5 - >100 mug/ml). The Prototheca isolates revealed an in vitro susceptibility to the polyene antifungal agents, amphotericin B, and nystatin (MIC = 0.09 to 3.12 mug/ml and 0.19 to 12.5 mug/ml, respectively; MFC/MAC = 0.19 to 25 mug/ml and 0.75 to 25 mug/ml, respectively).
