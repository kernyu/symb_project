A trial was carried out in 30 patients to assess the effectiveness of indanyl carbenicillin in acute or chronic urinary tract infections, many of which were complicated by a pathological urological or medical condition. In all patients, infection was due to a single species of pathogen: E. coli (19), Proteus (6), and Pseudomonas (5). Oral doses of 1 g indanyl carbenicillin were given 6-hourly for an average of 10 days. Results showed a clinical and bacteriological cure in 13 (43.8%) patients. In 6 patients, although there was initial clinical improvement, the pathogen developed resistance during therapy. In 7 patients, there was super-infection with another organism. Four patients were withdrawn early in treatment because of side-effects, mainly gastrointestinal in origin. Indanyl carbenicillin proved very effective in eradicating all strains of Proteus and Pseudomonas and 12 (70.6%) of the 17 strains of E. coli in patients completing the full course of treatment.
