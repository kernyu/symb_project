Within a large project for the socio-economic development of the rice growing area of the Rusizi valley in Burundi, a malarial control programme has been set up. This programme has several components: improvement of curative services, promotion of use of impregnated mosquito nets, and use of environmental engineering and indoor spraying with residual insecticides to control infection.
