This study was undertaken to develop an accurate, yet inexpensive, method for determining whether the bowel of a neutropenic patient is colonized with bacteria resistant to the antimicrobial agents used in empiric therapy. Selective agar media were prepared in which Mueller-Hinton agar or MacConkey agar were supplemented with one of the following antimicrobial agents: carbenicillin (16 micrograms/ml), gentamicin (4 micrograms/ml), or tobramycin (4 micrograms/ml). Moxalactam was incorporated initially at 16 micrograms/ml and subsequently at 8 micrograms/ml. Stools from neutropenic patients and bone marrow transplant recipients were inoculated on these media and on unsupplemented MacConkey agar. All bacteria that grew on the antibiotic-containing media were categorized as resistant to the supplementing drug; failure to detect an organism that did grow on the antibiotic-free MacConkey agar indicated susceptibility. These results were compared with those obtained for all isolates on all media by agar disk diffusion. There were 512 gram-negative enteric isolates from 320 stools obtained from 98 patients. The antibiotic-containing media suppressed the growth of 95% of bacteria that were identified as susceptible by agar disk diffusion. In detecting resistant organisms, the correlation between agar disk diffusion and direct stool screening with Mueller-Hinton agar ranged from 73 to 83%, and on MacConkey agar it ranged from 87 to 97%. The predictive value of a resistant result was 80 to 97% for the four antimicrobial agents when MacConkey agar was used. MacConkey agar performed better than Mueller-Hinton agar because of the greater ease of detecting different bacterial morphotypes. The cost of direct stool screening with antibiotic-supplemented MacConkey agar is approximately half the cost of routine methods of surveillance. Its cost and accuracy make the method a useful adjunct to the routine management of neutropenic patients.
