The data on the influence of acquired plasmid resistance to antibiotics on S. typhimurium phagovar. Plasmid R was transferred from S. typhimurium strain, isolated from the focus of hospital salmonellosis and resistant to the lytic action of phages, to Escherichia coli K12 and then to antibiotic-sensitive S. typhimurium strains of different phagovars, isolated from patients with alimentary toxicoinfections. The influence of plasmid R on the phagovar of recipient strains, most pronounced in strains of phagovar I, was revealed. The transconjugates of this phagovar considerably changed sensitivity to phages and in some cases acquired resistance to the lytic action of typing phages, thus becoming identical in this feature to the donor of the plasmid.
