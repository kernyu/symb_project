We studied the reciprocal antagonistic properties of 14 Listeria strains. Listeria innocua 29-CCM-A 819 (CIP 8011) produces a bacteriocin named Linnocuicina 819. This substance is mainly released in the exponential phase of growth and was isolated from the supernatant of TPB cultures. Thermal resistance and sensitivity to proteolytic enzymes was assayed. Linnocuicina 819 has a bactericidal mode of action producing a lytic effect.
