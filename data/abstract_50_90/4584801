Transformation of R-factor RP4 specifying resistance to ampicillin, kanamycin, and tetracycline from Escherichia coli to Rhizobium trifolii is reported. Partially purified RP4 deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) of the donor strain E. coli J5-3 that carried the R-factor was prepared by the lysozyme-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid-Triton X-100 procedure and was used in transformation experiments with R. trifolii as recipient. The frequency of transformation of the R-factor into R. trifolii was 1.3 x 10(-4). Dye buoyant density and sucrose gradient centrifugation of R. trifolii DNA showed that the expression of the specified drug resistance of RP4 by R. trifolii was accompanied by the acquisition of an extrachromosomal, satellite DNA component which has indistinguishable physical properties from the R-factor in the donor strain. The significance of the transformation is discussed.
