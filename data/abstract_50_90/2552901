The suppression of bacterial growth that persists after brief exposure to antimicrobial agents has been termed the postantibiotic effect (PAE). This pharmacodynamic interaction varies for each microorganism-antimicrobial agent combination. Daptomycin (LY146032) is a new lipopeptide antibiotic with activity against gram-positive organisms. We studied the in vitro bactericidal activities and PAEs of the following drugs: daptomycin compared with penicillin G and vancomycin, without and with gentamicin against Enterococcus faecalis strains; daptomycin compared with nafcillin and vancomycin against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus strains; and daptomycin compared with vancomycin against methicillin-resistant S. aureus strains. Daptomycin, alone and when used in combination with gentamicin, exhibited greater bactericidal activity and in general produced a longer PAE than standard effective regimens against the organism strains studied.
