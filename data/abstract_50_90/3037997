E-0702, a new cephalosporin with a potent antipseudomonal action, was synthesized. In the study of the mode of action of this antibiotic in Escherichia coli, it was found that mutants which acquired resistance to E-0702 were isolated spontaneously and could be shown to be susceptible to its closely related derivatives, E-0702-060 and E-0702-061, and other representative beta-lactam antibiotics. In these mutants, no increased production of beta-lactamase was detectable. No apparent differences between the resistant mutants and the parental strains were observed in the affinity of E-0702 for penicillin-binding proteins. Furthermore, no significant reduction in or loss of both OmpF and OmpC porin proteins in the outer membrane was observed. The mutation was mapped to the tonB gene, which is known to be essential for the iron transport system of bacteria. The bactericidal action of E-0702 was rapidly expressed against iron-starved cells in which the iron transport system was induced, whereas the bactericidal action against iron-supplemented cells was ineffective. It is suggested that E-0702 is incorporated into bacterial cells as a chelator of iron via the tonB-dependent iron transport system, after which its strong and rapid bactericidal action is manifested.
