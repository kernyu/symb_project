Selection of mutants of a low pathogenic strain E of R. prowazekii is a trend in genetic investigation of this Rickettsia species and one of the approaches to stabilizing the strain avirulent properties with a purpose of using in vaccine prophylaxis of typhus. The mutants of R. prowazekii, strain E selected by the authors earlier were characterized with respect to their infective capacity for chick embryos (CE) and antibiotic sensitivity. It was found that the infective capacity for CE of the erythromycin resistant mutant induced by nitroso guanidine (EErrI) was by ID50 2-3 logarithms lower than that of the initial strain E. The infective capacity for CE of the rifampicin resistant mutant induced by nitroso guanidine (ERifrI) and the spontaneous erythromycin resistant mutant was similar to that of strain E. The ERifrI strain differed from the initial strain E by higher sensitivity to tetracycline and erythromycin and the EErrI strain differed from the initial strain E by higher sensitivity to tetracycline and rifampicin. It was shown that the biological properties of the nitroso guanidine-induced mutants resistant to rifampicin and erythromycin differed from those of the initial strain E and the properties of the spontaneous erythromycin resistant mutant were similar to those of the initial strain E.
