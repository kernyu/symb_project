All urinary tract isolates were monitored in the Whittington Hospital, London for trimethoprim resistance over a three-month period in 1975; this survey was repeated 18 months later in 1977. In the later survey the incidence of trimethoprim resistance had increased significantly, and the proportion of strains carrying R-factors conferring trimethoprim resistance had nearly doubled. The pattern of resistances associated with R-factor trimethoprim resistance also changed betweeen these two surveys.
