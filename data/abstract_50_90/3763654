Ninety-nine patients with secondarily infected eczema were allocated at random to receive 10-days' treatment with either 2% fusidic acid plus 0.1% betamethasone cream or 0.1% gentamicin plus 0.1% betamethasone cream. Both preparations were applied to the lesions twice daily and assessment of the signs and symptoms was carried out before, after 2 to 4 days, and after 7 to 12 days of treatment, severity being rated on a 4-point scale. Bacteriological tests were carried out before and after treatment. The results showed that the combination with fusidic acid was marginally superior in clinical effect. Staphylococcus aureus was the most commonly isolated pathogen from eczematous lesions (86%) and fusidic acid showed the lowest resistance rate (9%), followed by gentamicin (21%). Chloramphenicol, neomycin and tetracycline showed resistance rates from 48% to 59%.
