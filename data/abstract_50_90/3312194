An Escherichia coli double mutant, sodAsodB, that is deficient in both bacterial superoxide dismutases (Mn superoxide dismutase and iron superoxide dismutase) is unable to grow on minimal medium in the presence of oxygen and exhibits increased sensitivity to paraquat and hydrogen peroxide. Expression of the evolutionarily unrelated eukaryotic CuZn superoxide dismutase in the sodAsodB E. coli mutant results in a wild-type phenotype with respect to aerobic growth on minimal medium and in resistance to paraquat and hydrogen peroxide. This supports the hypothesis that superoxide dismutation is the in vivo function of these proteins. Analysis of the growth of sodAsodB cells containing plasmids encoding partially active CuZn superoxide dismutases, produced by in vitro mutagenesis, shows a correlation between cell growth and enzyme activity. Thus, the sodAsodB strain provides a controlled selection for varying levels of superoxide dismutase activity.
