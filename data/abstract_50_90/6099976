The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of fourteen strains of penicillinase-producing Neisseria gonorrhoeae (PPNG) isolated in Ibadan to cefoxitin has been determined and compared with that of other antibiotics, viz. penicillin, ampicillin, thiamphenicol, spectinomycin, erythromycin and oxytetracycline. All the strains show high-level resistance to penicillin and ampicillin and the MIC of cefoxitin ranged from 0.5 to 16.0 micrograms/ml, with 71% of the strains having an MIC of 1.0 microgram/ml or less. The data suggest that cefoxitin may be a useful alternative to spectinomycin in the treatment of uncomplicated gonococcal infections, due to either PPNG or non-PPNG strains. However, further experiments and in vitro studies are indicated.
