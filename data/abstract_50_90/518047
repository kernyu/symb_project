High frequency of spontaneous and UV-and acridine dye-induced variants susceptible to oxytetracycline (OTC) and deprived of the capacity for synthesizing this antibiotic was observed in strain LST-118 of Actinomyces rimosus. The cells of strain LST-118 of Act. rimosus contained extrachromosomal DNA not found in its OTC susceptible variant BS87, which provides evidence in favour of participation of the extrachromosomal genetic elements in control of OTC resistance of the cells of Act. rimosus, LST-118. The OTC resistance in strain LST-118 is of inducable character. The resistance level is increasing from the beginning of the antibiotic synthesis and initially the subinhibitory concentrations of OTC in the medium were the inductors triggering cellular mechanisms ensuring resistance of the cell to the increasing concentrations of OTC in the medium. The capacity for absorption of OTC in Act rimosus is 2--3 times lower than that in E. coli. The experiments with labeled tetracycline showed that the cells of the actinomycete absorbed OTC when it was present in the medium. The absorption of the main amount of the antibiotic was registered during the first 5 minutes. The difference in absorption of OTC by the cells of the antibiotic resistant and sensitive strains was insignificant.
