Phagocytic reaction with respect to antibiotic and chloramine B sensitive and resistant staphylococci isolated from healthy persons and patients, air and stock of medical institutions was studied on albino mice. It was shown that the staphylococcal isolates included strains simultaneously sensitive to antibiotics and chloramine, sensitive to antibiotics and resistant to chloramine, resistant to antibiotics and sensitive to chloramine and simultaneously resistant to antibiotics and chloramine. Activity, intensity and completeness of phagocytosis by leucocytes from mouse abdominal cavity exudates with respect to the staphylococcal strains sensitive to antibiotics and resistant to chloramine, resistant to antibiotics and sensitive to chloramine and simultaneously resistant to antibiotics and chloramine were lower than the values of the phagocytic reaction with respect to the isolates simultaneously sensitive to antibiotics and chloramine. This suggested that not only antibiotic resistance of microbes but also their resistance to disinfectants could be referred to complicating factors of hospital infections.
