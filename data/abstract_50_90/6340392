The results obtained in the comparative study of the biological characteristics of Salmonella typhimurium strains of different origin are presented. The circulation of two biovariants differing in a number of biological characteristics, mainly in their susceptibility to antibiotics, has been shown. R-plasmids, mostly with the markers of resistance to tetracycline and with a molecular weight of 64 Md, have been isolated from "hospital" and "sporadic" strains possessing multiple antibiotic resistance.
