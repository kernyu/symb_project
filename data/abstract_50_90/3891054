Group B streptococci treated with cell wall synthesis inhibitors (penicillin or vancomycin) or by a variety of membrane-acting agents are sensitized to the lytic action of exogenous M1 muramidase. Muramidase without a sensitizing agent caused rupture of bacterial chains only, accompanied by the release of a small amount of cell wall peptidoglycan label and an increase of the number of colony-forming units. In combination with sensitizing agents the exogenous muramidase appeared to initiate hydrolysis of biosynthetically new peptidoglycan. Treatment of the cells with chloramphenicol or starvation for nutritionally required amino acids suppressed the rate of cell lysis and peptidoglycan hydrolysis during subsequent sensitization and muramidase treatment of the bacteria. Purified cell walls prepared from the amino acid starved cells were also hydrolyzed with a slower rate by muramidase. It is suggested that agents sensitizing the bacteria to the exogenous muramidase act by perturbing or removing some nonmurein components of the cell envelope which protect the peptidoglycan from the activity of exogenous enzyme. Agents increasing resistance against exogenous muramidase may also cause some alteration in peptidoglycan structure.
