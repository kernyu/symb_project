The author's own data and those available in literature on the experimental development of the interferon participation in anticarcinogenesis are reviewed. The mechanisms of antitumoural effects of exogenic interferon are analyzed and expediency of its incorporation into the complex antitumoural therapy aimed at prevention of the metastatic development is substantiated. The data are presented on the individual sensitivity of the human mammary gland cancer (the primary tumour and metastases) to interferon.
