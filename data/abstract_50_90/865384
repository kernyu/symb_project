The principles are discussed, which should serve as a basis for therapeutical decisions antecedent to the isolation of the causative agent and evaluation of the antibiogram. These concern the degree of urgency for chemotherapy, the frequency of the association of bacterial species with defined clinical pictures, the actual distribution of antibiotic resistance, the situation of the patient's immune defence system, and side effects of the drug. Possibilities of a "calculated" therapy in urinary tract infections, bronchitis, enteritis, septicaemia, and post-operative wound infection are explained. Considerations about the frequency of causative agents in certain bacterial infections and figures about the actual resistance distribution within bacteria species commonly connected with the disease in quesiton form the baseline for the choice of a chemotherapeutic until the antibiogram is performed.
