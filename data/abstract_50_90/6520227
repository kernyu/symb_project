Candida lusitaniae recovered from 58 specimens from 13 patients represented less than 1% of the yeasts isolated over a 15-month period. The majority of isolates were recovered from respiratory tract, stool, and urine specimens. Of the 13 patients, 1 had a documented infection associated with septicema. Urine isolates from that patient developed resistance to amphotericin B during therapy.
