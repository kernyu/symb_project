In an open study 50 patients were treated for a variety of infections with 3.2 g Timentin 6, 8- or 12-hourly for a mean period of six days. Timentin was clinically successful in 87% of patients assessed at the end of treatment of whom 95% remained cured or improved at a later follow-up. Bacteriologically Timentin was successful against 92% of organisms, including all 11 which were ticarcillin or ampicillin resistant. Side effects were reported in seven patients, the majority of which were minor local reactions at the site of infusion. This open study shows Timentin to be a safe and effective antibiotic for the treatment of infection.
