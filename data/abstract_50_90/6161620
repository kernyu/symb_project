The interferon (IF) inducing ability of some DNA and RNA viruses on mouse CCL-1 cells was investigated. The F and H strains of Newcastle disease virus (NDV) and Sendai virus proved to be the best inducers. GD-7, Mengo and Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) were middle inducers, Herpes simplex 1 (HSV 1) was a weak inducer, and Adenovirus 12 and Semliki forest (SFV) were non-inducers. Moreover antiviral resistance induced by the same viruses and IF production generally followed parallel paths.
