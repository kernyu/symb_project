Staphylococcal (nine Staphylococcus aureus and 14 coagulase negative) strains, isolated from subclinical bovine mastitis, showed three patterns of macrolide resistance: (i) macrolide-lincosamide constitutive resistance; (ii) macrolide generalised resistance; and (iii) lincosamide generalised resistance. The second pattern of resistance appeared to be a new resistance phenomenon. None of the strains showed dissociated or inducible resistance, neither was there any strain which could inactivate erythromycin, oleandomycin, lincomycin or clindamycin.
