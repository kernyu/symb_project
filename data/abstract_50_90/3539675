Blazar et al. recently found that chloroquine therapy decreased intravenous insulin requirements in a case of extreme insulin resistance. However, no relationship has been shown to exist between insulin degradation and the stimulation of glucose uptake. In this study we investigate the action of insulin on glucose uptake by the ability of this hormone to stimulate 2-deoxyglucose. The effect on alpha-aminoisobutyrate uptake, which is known to be insulin sensitive, is also investigated. Cell-associated 125I-labeled insulin and trichloroacetic acid-soluble and -precipitable substances were measured in parallel. Chloroquine increased insulin-stimulated uptake of 2-deoxyglucose and alpha-aminoisobutyrate. Three hours were required for this effect to appear, and it did not depend on DNA synthesis. Chloroquine also increased cell-associated insulin and slightly decreased the percentage of trichloroacetic acid-soluble products. Methylamine affected neither nutrient uptake processes nor insulin binding and degradation; however, it did abolish the effect of chloroquine on these parameters. These data suggest that in chick embryo fibroblasts a relationship may exist between the increase in undegraded cell-associated insulin and the ability of the hormone to stimulate sugar and amino acid uptake.
