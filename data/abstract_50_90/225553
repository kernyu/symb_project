Mutations (paar) in herpes simplex virus (HSV) which confer resistance to phosphonoacetic acid involve genes associated with virus-induced DNA polymerase activity. Two mutants of HSV (HSV-1 tsH and HSV-2 ts6) produce a thermolabile DNA polymerase activity. In this study, the ts lesions present in these mutants and those present in two independent phosphonoacetic acid-resistant mutants of HSV-1 and HSV-2 (paar-1 and paar-2) have been physically mapped by restriction endonuclease analysis of recombinants produced between HSV-1 and HSV-2 by intertypic marker rescue. All four mutations mapped within a 3.3-kilobase pair region around map unit 40. The accuracy of the method is reflected by the mapping results for tsH and paar-2, which were found to lie in the same 1.3-kilobase pair region. paar-1 was found to lie to the right of ts6. Virus-induced DNA polymerase is thought to have a molecular weight of 150,000, necessitating a gene with a coding capacity of 4.6 kilobase pairs. The four mutations mapped in this study all lie within a region smaller than this, but the results do not yet prove that all four lesions reside in this or any single gene.
