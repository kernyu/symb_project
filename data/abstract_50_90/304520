We studied on the sensitivity of 184 candida species from various samples isolated in our mycology laboratory, to nystatin, miconazole and pimaricine by using both the agar disc diffusion and dilution methods and then compared the results. Our findings showed that antimycotic sensitivity could largely vary in different candida species. Therefore, we came to the conclusion that the use of sensitivity tests in infections caused by candidas, as used in bacerial infections, would play an important role for cure effectiveness and in the fight against resistance increases as well. In addition it is well observed that the practical characteristics of agar disc diffusion techniques in valid also for candidas.
