Distribution of plasmids and genetic determinants of antibiotic resistance was studied in 129 strains of Pseudomonas, Klebsiella, Serratia and Enterobacter isolated from oncological patients. It was shown that 56 isolates contained the plasmids, 9 conjugative plasmids being plasmids with broad bacterial host spectrum. A significant part of the strains contained genes controlling production of APH (3"), type II APH (3'), type I and II DHPS and type type II DHFR. Genetic determinants of tetracycline resistance of classes D and E were detected for the first time in the strains of Klebsiella, Serratia and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
