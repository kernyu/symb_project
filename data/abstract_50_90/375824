Clinico-bacteriological examination of patients with purulent infections showed that Staphylococcus was the predominating microflora in the wounds. Simultaneously an increasing role of gram-negative conditionally pathogenic bacteria was shown. Multiple drug resistance was found in the organisms tested. The highest sensitivity levels were observed to gentamicin, kanamycin, tetracycline, levomycetin. It was shown by means of special typing methods that staphylococci of phage group III and Ps. Aeruginosa of serotype II predominated in the infected wounds. When the pathological material contained the antibiotic resistant cultures of Ps. aeruginosa, Proteus, Klebsiella and toxigenic strains of Staphylococcus, a tendency for prolongation of the suppurative process was observed.
