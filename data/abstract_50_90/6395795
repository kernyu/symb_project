Sensitivity of 146 clinical strains of Candida albicans to nystatin, levorin and amphoglucamine was studied on solid media with the replica method. The strains were isolated from 79 patients with candidiasis of the oral mucosa. It was found that sensitivity of the fungi to the polyenic antibiotics was different which should be considered in treatment of candidiasis. On the basis of the mean MICs for the clinical strains and their distribution by the MICs it was shown that the activity level of levorin and amphoglucamine was higher than that of nystatin. During the treatment resistance of the Candida strains to the polyenic antibiotics increased and cross resistance developed which required application of other treatment means.
