The staphylococcal flora of the groin and perianal area was studied in 12 patients undergoing aortic grafts and 3 patients having repair of ventral abdominal hernias. A total of 892 isolates of coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) were identified and their antibiotic resistance determined. The species most frequently isolated were S. epidermidis and S. haemolyticus with the latter showing the highest incidence of antibiotic resistance. Five of 15 patients had CNS resistant to methicillin and gentamicin on admission. The effect of pre-operative bathing with chlorhexidine was studied in 6 patients and appeared to reduce the acquisition of multi-resistant CNS in the week after operation.
