Experiments on clotting, both in vitro and in vivo, showed that a colloidal graphite surface, when rinsed with a cationic, surface-active agent, was capable of bonding heparin. The resistance of this graphite-heparin surface to the formation of clots was far greater than plastic or silicone surfaces in comparable studies.
