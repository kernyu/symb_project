The analytic hierarchy process (AHP) was used to determine which of seven recommended antibiotic regimens represented optimal initial therapy for a young woman hospitalized for treatment of acute pyelonephritis. The model included the following criteria: maximize cure, minimize adverse effects (broken down into very serious, serious, and limited), minimize antibiotic resistance, and minimize cost (divided into total cost and patient cost). The criteria were weighted according to judgments made by 61 practicing clinicians. Alternatives were compared relative to the criteria using published information on the expected frequencies of urinary pathogens and drug toxicity, local antibiotic sensitivities and antibiotic charges, and expert opinion regarding their propensities for inducing antimicrobial resistance. The analysis identified ampicillin combined with gentamicin as the optimal regimen. This study illustrates several features of the AHP that make it promising for use in medical decision making: its ability to incorporate multiple criteria into a formal decision model, its procedural simplicity, and its similarity to current patient management guidelines. Further studies to establish the role of the AHP in medical decision making are warranted.
