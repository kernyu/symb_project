We used the photodynamic inactivation technique with proflavine as the photoactive dye to treat herpetic epithelial keratitis in a preliminary study of patients who had idoxuridine toxicity or resistance. A comparative study with idoxuridine in treating dendritic ulcerations of the cornea showed a good therapeutic effect. But the investigation was suspended when adverse reactions, consisting of a generalized epithelial keratitis and an anterior uveitis, possibly of phototoxic origin, developed in a few patients receiving treatment. The ulcers treated by photodynamic inactivation apparently healed by a process of "debridement" followed by subsequent re-epithelialization.
