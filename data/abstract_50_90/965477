This paper reports on the serological and biochemical characteristics of 24 human isolates of Yersinia enterocolitica submitted to the California Department of Health from 1968 through 1975. Nine different serotypes were represented. The majority of strains were serotype O:8 (six strains) and serotype O:5 (five strains). Sources of the isolates included feces (12 cases), blood (3), sputum or throat (3), bile or bowel drainage (2), wounds (2), breast abscess (1), and skin abscess (1). Clinical histories indicated a number of different syndromes. Underlying medical conditions existed in 13 cases. Results of selected biochemical tests and antimicrobial susceptibility tests on the strains indicated grouping compatible with the O serotypes of the organisms.
