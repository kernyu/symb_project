Present-day problems of infection by Staphylococcus aureus are described against a brief historical account of the evolution of the multiple antibiotic resistant 'hospital staph'. which caused such immense problems of hospital cross-infection in the 1950's and 1960's. These problems have lessened considerably since that time, but staphylococcal infection still remains as a cause of morbidity and mortality. Diagnosis and treatment are not always straight-forward. Apart from applying general supportive measures, and appropriate surgical intervention when necessary, the attending doctor is faced with making a choice from a multiplicity of antibiotic agents. A brief account of the main antibiotic agents currently available is given with comments on some of the disadvantages and complications attendant on their use. The potential dangers of staphylococcal sepsis and the need for rapid diagnosis and prompt vigorous treatment are stressed.
