Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and their complications are common in Southeast Asia (SEA) and the Western Pacific region. Gonorrhea, chancroid, nongonococcal urethritis, and syphilis are still the major STDs. However, the clinical incidence of genital herpes and genital warts show a definite increase. The gonococcal infections in SEA show high levels of antimicrobial resistance. There is a high level of chromosomal-mediated and plasmid-mediated penicillinase resistance. The sex industry, strongly fueled by local consumption, travel, and tourism, continues to play an important focal role in maintaining the high level of transmission of STDs in SEA and the Western Pacific region.
