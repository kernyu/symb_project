A tetracycline-resistant Haemophilus ducreyi strain isolated in the United States was shown to carry a 34-megadalton plasmid which hybridized with the 1.8-kilobase KpnI-HindIII Tet M probe. The complete Tn916 transposon hybridized with five different bands from this plasmid, suggesting homology throughout the length of the transposon.
