A total of 35 Escherichia coli isolates obtained from necropsy materials of hens with septicemia in the Konya region of Turkey were examined for hemagglutination (HA), cell-surface hydrophobicity, enterotoxigenicity, and drug resistance. HA tests were performed on live cultures with human (group A), bovine, avian (chicken), and guinea pig erythrocytes with and without mannose. Nine HA patterns were observed. Of the 35 isolates, 62.8% exhibited mannose sensitive hemagglutination (MSHA), 8.6% exhibited mannose resistant hemagglutination (MRHA), and 28.6% did not hemagglutinate. Of the isolates, 85.7% were hydrophobic by a salt aggregation test (SAT). Only three isolates were enterotoxigenic by a suckling mouse assay. The majority of the isolates were resistant to chloramphenicol, tetracycline, streptomycin, ampicillin, erythromycin, and trimethoprim + sulfamethoxazole but were highly sensitive to gentamicin and nalidixic acid.
