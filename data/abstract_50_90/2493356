Although ethchlorvynol (ECV) has been used to induce pulmonary damage in animals, changes after injection of this drug have not been studied, nor has the stability of the animal been assessed after injection. Continuously monitored hemodynamic and respiratory changes were followed during and after iv injection of 55 mg/kg ECV in ethanol into anesthetized, paralyzed, and ventilated swine (n = 5) and compared to changes in a control group given ethanol alone (n = 5). Arterial and mixed venous saturations were measured by fiberoptic vascular catheters and oxygen exchange by a gas monitor. Twelve direct and derived variables were monitored every 20 sec using a computer data acquisition system. Arterial oxygen saturation was kept at 90 +/- 2% by adjustment of FIO2. Ethanol produced only transitory changes during infusion. Significant elevations in pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), shunt (Qsp/Qt) and deadspace (VD/VT) were observed during and after ECV. These were unaccompanied by changes in cardiac output or arterial pressure. PVR increased by 137%, Qsp/Qt by 67%, and VD/VT by 28% over 30 min. These changes were then sustained in the postinfusion period, producing a stable model of early adult respiratory distress syndrome for 3.5 h.
