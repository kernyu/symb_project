We report a male patient with severe penicillin-resistant gonococcal urethritis, coinfected with a tetracycline resistant strain of ureaplasma urealyticum. Ureaplasmas are frequently involved in gonococcal urethritis and commonly this organism may persist after the penicillin therapy causing a "post-gonoccal-urethritis" (PGU). Additional treatment with tetracyclines prove to be successful in most of these patients except in cases of tetracycline resistance in ureaplasma urealyticum. In a case like this erythromycin may be useful, a drug to which these isolates are sensitive. The microbiological and genetic feature of a tetracycline resistant strain of ureaplasma urealyticum is presented in detail. The clinical and epidemiological importance of these results are discussed and compared with the literature.
