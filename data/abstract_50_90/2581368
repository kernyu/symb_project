The 5th and 6th fractions of thymosin, a hormone of the thymus gland, stimulated interferon production both in vivo (experiments in white and CBA mice) and in vitro in CBA mouse splenocytes when different interferon inducers were used (phage dsRNA, poly(G): poly(C), NDV, and mitogens). The highest stimulating effect in vivo was observed with interferon induction 6-8 hours after thymosin administration. An increase in production of both alpha/beta and gamma interferons under the influence of thymosin was observed. Thymosin alone induced no interferon synthesis.
