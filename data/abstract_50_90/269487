A classification, according to the Lancefield's method, of the streptocoques isolated in the blood, after teeth extractions, as well as a determination of their sensibility to the antibiotics, are attempted in this study. It concerns to 23 adults, well supported, to whom multiple extractions, under general anesthesia have been done. We studied both biochemical and serological reactions, and a test for the antibiotic resistance is realised. We insiste in the contrindiction of streptomycine and sulfanilamides in the treatment or the prevention of bacteremia of dental origine.
