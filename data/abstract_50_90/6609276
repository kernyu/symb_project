An early pars plana vitrectomy was performed without any additional intravitreal antimycotic therapy in 8 eyes of 5 patients with candida endophthalmitis; anatomic healing with a good functional result was obtained. The good prognosis of vitrectomy without intravitreal antimycotic therapy in our patients is seen in (1) a total surgical extraction of the abscess and (2) the better intraocular ventilation obtained for endogenous resistance.
