A monoclonal antibody (MAb) with specificity for murine interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) was used as a probe for studying the effect of recombinant IFN-gamma (rIFN-gamma) on antiviral activity, Fc receptor expression, and Ia antigen induction in macrophages. Cultures of C3H/HeJ peritoneal exudate macrophages were used to allow direct comparison of all three functions in the same target cell system. Our data provide two major findings: the efficacy of the MAb is very different depending on whether murine fibroblasts or macrophages are used as the target cell in the antiviral assay, i.e., greater than 20 to 100 times more MAb was required to block antiviral activity in macrophage cultures; and 10 to 50 times more MAb was required to inhibit Fc receptor vs Ia antigen expression in response to rIFN-gamma. These latter findings confirm and extend previous observations, which indicate that the induction pathways of two important differentiation markers by IFN-gamma may be dissociable.
