A total of 489 patients at the age of 18 to 74 with acute dysentery of medium severity without concomitant diseases were observed. The patients were subjected to combined therapy with the use of antibiotics, sulfanilamides and stimulants. The state of the patients' natural resistance was determined by the dynamics and levels of the bactericidal activity of lysozyme, blood serum complement as well as lysozyme and beta-lysine coprofiltrates. It was found that the use of tetracycline, furazolidone combinations with sulfanilamides and leukopoiesis-stimulating drugs had a favourable effect on the dynamics of the host natural resistance reduction. The reduction of the natural resistance in the patients treated with levomycetin in combination with sulfanilamides and stimulants was much slower than the clinical recovery.
