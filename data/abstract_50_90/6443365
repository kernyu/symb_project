As a part of preclinical trials of 2,996 clinical isolates from three larger hospitals in Prague were qualitatively and quantitatively assayed for in vitro sensitivity to ceftazidime. In gramnegative bacteria the incidence of resistance to ceftazidime in strain of Enterobacter, Serratia Proteus and Pseudomonas species ranged from 4% to 6% of strains. In grampositive bacteria only strains of enterococci, listeriae and anaerobic bacteria are excluded from the action of this broad-spectrum antibiotic. According to present experiences the antipseudomonal activity of ceftazidime is approximately the same as that of cefsulodine and cefoperazone. Alarmingly, one of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates was found to show a distinct multiresistance to all available lactam, aminoglycoside and broad-spectrum antimicrobials, including ceftazidime.
