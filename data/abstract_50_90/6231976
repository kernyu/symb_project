A simple and efficient method for obtaining nonlysogenic bacteria from lambda-lysogenized strains using phage with an inserted antibiotic-resistant plasmid is described. When the lysogenic culture is infected with antibiotic-resistant phage, single non-lysogenic cells are lysogenized, isolated on selective medium, and cured of phage during incubation at 37 degrees C.
