Since 1971, over 90% of cultures of Staphylococcus aureus isolated from pus specimens obtained in Port Moresby General Hospital have been resistant to penicillin, Since 1979 the percentage has risen to 98% and in addition chloramphenicol resistance has been noted in 26% of isolates since that year. Cases of methicillin or gentamicin resistance have not yet been detected. Even when the possibility of staphylococcal infection is suspected, penicillin or penicillin and chloramphenicol continue to be the initial treatment prescribed in 90.6% of subjects with pyomyositis, 88.5% with acute osteomyelitis, 88.2% with pneumonia and 90% with bacteraemia. Appropriate initial treatment of patients in Port Moresby who are suspected or proven to have serious S. aureus infection should include a beta-lactamase resistant penicillin or suitable alternative bacteriocidal antibiotic.
