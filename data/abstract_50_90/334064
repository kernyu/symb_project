Antibiotic-resistant bacteria were isolated from seawater samples collected in the Atlantic Ocean off the southeastern coast of the United States. Large numbers of antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains were found to be present in harbor and inshore waters; however, the percentage of resistant strains was higher for several seawater samples collected offshore than for those collected near shore. Bacteria resistant to tetracycline, chloramphenicol, and streptomycin were found in nearly all samples collected, including samples from 200 miles (about 522 km) offshore and at depths to 8,200 m. Sediment samples, in general, were found to contain smaller populations of resistant strains as compared with the seawater samples examined. Antibiotic-resistant bacteria exhibiting phenetic characteristics common to autochthonous marine bacterial species were examined in detail, and several of the isolates exhibited unstable antibiotic resistance, which was transferable to recipient Escherichia coli cells. Deoxyribonucleic acid preparations from 10 strains examined by ethidium bromide-cesium chloride density sedimentation revealed that 6 of the strains contained covalently closed circular plasmid deoxyribonucleic acid.
