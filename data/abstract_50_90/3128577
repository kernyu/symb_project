Vancomycin-resistant Streptococcus salivarius-like bacteria were isolated from the blood and gastrostomy tube of a 6-month-old child during vancomycin therapy for Staphylococcus epidermidis central venous catheter-associated bacteremia. The isolates produced D-(-)-lactate and ethanol from glucose, hydrolyzed esculin, and produced no ammonia from arginine, thus fulfilling the major criteria as Leuconostoc spp. The enzymatic profile of the bacteria suggested that they were not lactobacilli or streptococci. Resistance to vancomycin and penicillin tolerance were noted. The formula fed through the gastrostomy tube was suspected as the vehicle that transmitted the organism to the patient. Penicillin and tobramycin therapy was used successfully.
