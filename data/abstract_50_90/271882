The susceptibilities of 14 recent isolates of Leptospira to benzyl penicillin, tetracycline and minocycline, were tested. All strains were highly susceptible to penicillin. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of the two tetracyclines were generally low, and no significant difference was found between them.
