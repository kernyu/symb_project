An active form of phosphorylase phosphatase of Mr = 33,000, referred to as the catalytic subunit for over a decade, was purified to near-homogeneity from rabbit skeletal muscle. Repeated immunization of a sheep produced immunoglobulins that blocked the activity of the phosphatase. These immunoglobulins were affinity-purified on columns of immobilized phosphorylase phosphatase and used as macromolecular probes in a "Western" immunoblotting procedure with peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-sheep immunoglobulins. Only one protein, of Mr = 33,000, was stained in samples of the immunogen, attesting to the specificity of the probes. However, the Mr = 33,000 phosphatase protein was not detected in muscle extracts or in partially purified preparations. Instead, a single protein of Mr = 70,000 was detected. Limited proteolysis, in particular by Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease and thermolysin, converted the immunoreactive protein from Mr = 70,000 to Mr = 33,000. Coagulation of the phosphatase preparation with 80% ethanol at room temperature rendered the Mr = 70,000 protein insoluble, but allowed extraction of the Mr = 33,000 protein from the precipitate. Thus, we conclude that the immunoreactive protein of Mr = 70,000 is the "catalytic subunit" of phosphorylase phosphatase with a catalytic domain of Mr = 33,000. Previous purification schemes have yielded only the fragment of Mr = 33,000 due to its relative resistance to proteolysis and coagulation. Gel filtration chromatography of the "native" form of phosphorylase phosphatase showed Mr approximately 230,000. Both the Mr = 70,000 catalytic subunit and a Mr = 60,000 protein related to inhibitor-2 were detected by immunoblotting in the same fractions that exhibited activity after treatment with Co2+ and trypsin. Only the Mr = 60,000 protein was degraded during this activation process. We propose that the native phosphorylase phosphatase is an elongated structure with two-fold symmetry, containing one catalytic subunit of Mr = 70,000 and one regulatory subunit of Mr = 60,000.
