During one year, by disk diffusion, we have studied in two general hospitals, the susceptibility to ampicillin of Haemophilus influenzae isolated from various clinical specimens, CSF (2 strains), blood (1 strain), ears (6 strains), eyes (18 strains), lower respiratory tract specimens (111 strains), genital specimens (7 strains), and various other specimens (3 strains). The beta-lactamase production was researched systematically with a chromogenic test. At all 148 strains of H. influenzae were examined. Drug resistance was observed for 18 strains (12.2%). All strains produced a beta-lactamase. The study of drug resistance of H. influenzae with the regard of the age showed an higher percentage of resistant strains isolated from children than the percentage of resistant strains isolated from adults. From children, 10 out of 50 strains (20%) were resistant to ampicillin, on the other hand 8 out of 98 (8.2%) strains isolated from adults were resistant to ampicillin.
