Sensitivity of 99 Proteus strains isolated from infants with gastro-intestinal diseases was studied by the method of serial dilutions on the Ploskirev's medium with respect to 19 antibiotics and some of their pair combinations. High resistance levels were registered with respect to penicillin and semi-synthetic penicillins, such as oxacillin, methicillin, ampicillin, as well as oleandomycin, erythromycin, lincomycin and oxytetracycline. The minimum inhibitory concentration for most of the strains was at least 128 gamma/ml. The Proteus strains were more sensitive to aminoglycosides, such as monomycin, neomycin and kanamycin, as well as carbenicillin, cephalosporine, streptomycin, levomycetin, chlortetracycline and novobiocin. Rifampicin, gentamycin and ampicillin combinations with gentamycin had a pronounced antimicrobial effect on Proteus.
