Surveys on drug sensitivity of Plasmodium falciparum carried out between 1985 and 1989 included 7-day in vitro tests and in vivo tests. 485 in vivo tests were carried out in eight surveys conducted in Brazzaville and in several inland regions. The subjects were congolese children aged between 3 months and 15 years old. They were recruited in hospital, mother-child clinics or at school. The drugs studied were chloroquine, amodiaquine and the sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine combination. 182 strains were tested in vitro in two surveys (December 1985 and January 1987); amino-4-quinolines, quinine and mefloquine were studied. Although resistance to amino-4-quinolines is a recent occurrence, by 1985 it had spread widely in the indigenous population in the Centre and South of the country. Resistance has since increased gradually, especially for chloroquine which undergoes specific surveillance. The situation is less serious in the North, a less densely populated region which is still enclosed. In an in vivo comparative study with chloroquine conducted in Brazzaville in November 1986, amodiaquine was found to be only slightly more effective at a similar dosage. At that time, certain isolated observations already seem to imply that the sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine combination was also affected by resistance. This was not corroborated in an in vivo study carried out in 1989 on 40 children presenting with a malarial attack. Although the sensitivity to quinine may probably be decreased. This drug cannot yet be considered as being truly affected by resistance. The activity of mefloquine, the use of which is still limited, was satisfactory in 1987 in two different regions of the country.
