Shigella were most sensitive to polymyxin ceporin, ampicillin, neomycin and furazolidone and resistant to chloramphenicol, tetracycline and streptomycin. Shigella resistant simultaneously to two or three drugs mainly to tetracycline + chloramphenicol, tetracycline + streptomycin and tetracycline + chloramphenicol + streptomycin were most frequent. The frequency of the Shigella strains carrying R-plasmids increased from 28 per cent in 1969--1970 to 72.6 per cent in 1977. The Shigella strains isolated during the dysentery outbreak in 1973--1977 carried the R-factor controlling resistance to tetracycline + chloramphenicol, tetracycline + chloramphenicol + streptomycin, tetracycline + chloramphenicol + streptomycin + neomycin. Interaction between separate biochemical types, colicinogenicity and drug resistance classes was found in the Shigella isolates. The data on the effect of antibiotic (tetracyclines) intensive use in stock-raising defining wide spread of the R-plasmids controlling resistance to these drugs were obtained.
