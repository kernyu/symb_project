We practiced a preoperative prophylaxis with 1.5g metronidazole daily starting three days before operation because of the increasing knowledge about the importance of anaerobic microorganisms, causing nosocomial infections. By this regime we saw a significant decrease of postoperative morbidity, detected by means of postoperative febrile temperatures and laparotomy wound abscesses. Bacteriological examinations before and after prophylaxis revealed a relatively high elimination of anaerobic isolates without influence on the aerobic and physiologic flora. In 66% of the cases with infections we isolate anaerobic strains. In cases of pelvic inflammatory diseases metronidazole is to be recommended both prophylactically and therapeutically. There is no resistance against metronidazole.
