In this study we investigated the relation between enhanced resistance and delayed hypersensitivity (DH) induced with subcellular preparations from Listeria monocytogenes and the adjuvant dimethyldioctadecylammonium bromide (DDA). Ribosomal RNA as well as cell envelope fragments (fraction I) protected mice against lethal Listeria infection. However, only fraction I induced DH against killed Listeria. For the induction of protection with fraction I or RNA as well as for the induction of DH with fraction I, preparations had to be administered in combination with DDA. Fraction I elicited a DH response in mice immunized with viable Listeria, but RNA did not. These observations pointed to a dissociation between DH and enhanced resistance induced with RNA, and to a dissociation between fraction I and RNA with respect to their ability to induce or elicit DH. Also DH and enhanced resistance induced with fraction I could be dissociated. Intracutaneous administration of fraction I induced high levels of DH without concomitant induction of protection against lethal challenge with Listeria. On the other hand, intraperitoneal administration of fraction I fully protected mice against lethal infection, but only induced a moderate DH response. DH induced with fraction I was largely specific, whereas enhance resistance induced with this preparation was nonspecific. Finally, proteinase K-sensitive proteins were found to be essential for the induction of DH but not for the induction of protection with fraction I.
