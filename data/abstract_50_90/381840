Upon integration into the bacterial chromosome the drug resistance plasmid R100.1 often loses its tetracycline resistance character. We have analyzed an Hfr strain formed by such an integration and an R-prime plasmid derived from it. We find that integration took place within the Tn10 transposon, that the two IS10 sequences were retained, but that at least 80% of the transposon segment located between them, and carrying the tetracycline resistance genes, had been lost. We suggest that integration of R100.1 was mediated by an inverse transposition using the IS10 sequences.
