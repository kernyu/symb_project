A number of biologically active substances, i. e. main protamine proteins and histones, EDTA, lysozyme, methacyl and pentoxyl was studied with respect to their effect on the levels of the minimum inhibitory concentrations of antibiotics against E. coli and Staph. aureus and transfer of resistence to chloramphenicol in E. coli on conjugation. It was shown that the above substances lowered the minimum inhibitory concentrations of the antibiotics 2--10 times when added to the culture simultaneously with the latter. The results varied depending on the strain and the resistance nature. Marked inhibition of transfer of resistance to chloramphenicol in the presence of the main proteins and EDTA was found.
