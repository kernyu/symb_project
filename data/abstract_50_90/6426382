Examination of beta-lactam susceptibility of mutants altered in the control of chromosomal beta-lactamase of Pseudomonas aeruginosa supports the view that a constitutive level of beta-lactamase is not an adequate explanation for resistance to cefsulodin and ceftazidime but could be for resistance to piperacillin which has an efficiency of hydrolysis ca. 10 times higher than does cefsulodin or ceftazidime.
