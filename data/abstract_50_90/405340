A case of osteomyelitis of the maxilla in a healthy infant is presented, the etiology of which seems to have been an upper respiratory tract infection. There was no evidence of lowered resistance and immunologic studies did not reveal any abnormality. Lincomycin seems to be the antibiotic drug of choice. In the present case, it was used, effectively, in conjunction with other antibiotics and surgical drainage.
