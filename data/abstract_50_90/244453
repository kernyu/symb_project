During the October 1973 military conflict, 41 burned patients hospitalized at the Sheba Medical Center were closely followed up. All the patients who had burns occupying 20% or more of the body surface developed wound infections. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the major pathogen isolated. Most infections occurred during the second week following the injury. Serial cultures revealed that only the isolation of Proteus species and P. aeruginosa from wounds could predict an infection caused by those microorganisms. During treatment with gentamicin and carbenicillin a marked increase in carbenicillin-resistant P. aeruginosa and gentamicin-resistant Klebsiella strains was noted. Cross-infections with carbenicillin-resistant P. aeruginosa was not a major cause in the development of resistant strains.
