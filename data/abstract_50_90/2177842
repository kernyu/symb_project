Many peripheral tissues express the proopiomelanocortin (POMC) gene as an 800-base mRNA that lacks the 5' end of the 1200-base pituitary transcript. The missing region encodes the peptide signal sequence, and thus, it is unlikely that any translation product would be secreted. We have found that a RNA transcript equivalent to this short message, generated by transcription in vitro from a T7 polymerase promoter, is translatable in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate, generating peptides of 27.5, 22.5, and 15.5 kD. None of these peptides appears to be processed or protected from proteinase-K digestion by a microsomal membrane fraction. In vivo studies were undertaken by transfecting into GH3 cells one of two expression vectors containing sequences that would produce either a full-length mRNA or a short (800-base) mRNA. The neomycin resistance gene was cotransfected with these plasmids, and 30 permanent cell lines were produced after selection in G418. Cell lines containing the full-length RNA secreted large quantities of ACTH and beta-endorphin immunoreactivity, whereas those expressing the short transcript secreted neither of these peptides. However extractable peptide was present in this latter type of cell line, thereby suggesting that the 800-base mRNA was translated, and that no peptide reached the secretory vesicle. These findings raise important questions about the role of peripheral POMC gene expression.
