A number of mutants of Caulobacter crescentus CB15 resistant ot ampicillin were isolated. The mutants differred in their resistance to several beta-lactam antibiotics. No differences in composition of the penicillin-binding proteins of the mutants compared to the parental strain, or in the affinity of these proteins to penicillin or ampicillin were found. The mutants were found to differ from the parent and also in many cases from each other in outer membrane protein composition.
