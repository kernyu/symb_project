A series of mutations of the P1 plasmid prophage that lead to increased copy number was isolated and analyzed. The copy number of the mutants was elevated at least five- to eightfold relative to wild-type P1, as determined by single-cell resistance to antibiotics, activity of enzymes, content of superhelical DNA, and reassociation kinetics. The copy number of two of the mutants was temperature dependent. Based on dominance tests, the mutants fell into two classes, cis specific and recessive. The latter class included a temperature-sensitive copy mutant. The existence of a class of recessive mutants suggests that the replication of the P1 plasmid is negatively regulated.
