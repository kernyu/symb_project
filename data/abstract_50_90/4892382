The thermosensitive kanamycin (KM) resistance factor, R(KM)(t), and a nonthermosensitive multiple-drug resistance factor, R(100), were simultaneously introduced into Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium. The temperature sensitivity of both R factors remained unchanged as long as they replicated independently. Under certain conditions, however, a new thermosensitive R factor harboring resistance markers for kanamycin, streptomycin (SM), and sulfanilamide (SA) was obtained by recombination between the R(KM)(t) and R(100) factors. R factors carrying resistance markers for KM and SA, or for SM and SA, were obtained from the recombinant R(KM SA SM)(t) by spontaneous segregation. Though the R(100) factor has been known as an fi(+) (positive for F-mediated fertility inhibition of its host) type and it does not restrict any coexisting phages, the thermosensitive recombinants of R(100) with R(KM)(t) and their segregants were found to be fi(-) and to restrict the replication of all T-even phages, as does the R(KM)(t) factor. Double infection immunity was not observed between the R(KM)(t) and R(100) factors.
