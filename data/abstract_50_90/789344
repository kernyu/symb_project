Twelve plasmids carrying genes for streptomycin and sulfonamide resistance were studied for the number and distribution of sites on the plasmid moleucles susceptible to cleavage by the restriction endonuclease EcoRI. Ten of the twelve were found to have a single cut site, one plasmid (R678) had three such sites, and plasmid PB165, which was isolated as three supercoiled deoxyribonucleic acid species with molecular weights 7.4 x 10(6), 14.7 x 10(6), and 21.4 x 10(6) was reduced to a single (linear) species of molecular weight 7.6 x 10(6) after cutting with EcoRI. We conclude that PB165 forms oligomers in Escherichia coli and that the number of copies of these per chromosome is more consistant and that the number of copies of these per chromosome is more consistent with a negative than a positive control mechanism for plasmid replication. Compatibility testing of a positive control mechanism for plasmid replication. Compatibility testing of these plasmids showed they all belong to the same incompatibility group, which we designate IncQ, suggesting that they may have come from a common ancestor.
