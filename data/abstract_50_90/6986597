An outbreak of amikacin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (KES) occurred in the Intensive Care Nursery (ICN) of the Louisville General Hospital from January 1978 through March 1978. Epidemic disease and an increased colonization rate in newborn infants due to amikacin-resistant microorganisms has not been documented previously. Three of the 11 neonates died. The organisms isolated were resistant to amikacin and two experimental aminoglycosides, sissomicin and netilmicin. The outbreak was contained following institution of several control measures, including pharyngeal inoculation of an experimental strain of alpha streptococcus in four infants.
