We have established a transformation system for Dictyostelium discoideum. The transformation vector contains the protein coding region of the Tn5 neomycin resistance gene fused to the proposed promoter of the Dictyostelium actin 8 gene; the vector also contains a sequence that acts as an autonomously replicating sequence (ars) in yeast. Using this vector, we can transform Dictyostelium vegetative amoebae to be resistant to aminoglycoside G418 at a frequency of between 10(-6) and 10(-4) of the input cells. The transformed cell lines are stable and contain vector sequences integrated within chromosomal DNA.
