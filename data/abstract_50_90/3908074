Norfloxacin is one of the new 4-quinolone antibacterial agents. A fluorinated piperazinyl-substituted congener of nalidixic acid, it demonstrates a much wider in vitro antibacterial spectrum and greater potency than the parent compound. Its antibacterial activity against most Gram-negative pathogens is enhanced in comparison to nalidixic acid, but is similar to that of some of the other new 4-quinolones like enoxacin, and slightly less than that of ciprofloxacin. Unlike nalidixic acid, norfloxacin is also active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and some Gram-positive organisms. In acute or uncomplicated urinary tract infections, norfloxacin has repeatedly been shown to be as effective as co-trimoxazole. Single studies have demonstrated a significantly better bacteriological cure rate with norfloxacin than with pipemidic acid, and similar cure rates with norfloxacin and both a nalidixic acid/sodium citrate mixture and amoxycillin. Similar results were found in a few studies comparing norfloxacin to pipemidic acid or amoxycillin in patients with chronic and/or complicated urinary tract infections. Norfloxacin is as effective as spectinomycin in gonorrhoea due to penicillin-resistant N. gonorrhoeae, and cures bacterial gastroenteritis caused by several gastrointestinal pathogens. Norfloxacin appears to be well tolerated and may have a low propensity to select for bacterial resistance during clinical use, although the latter needs further confirmation.
