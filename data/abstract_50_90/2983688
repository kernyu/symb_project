Stepwise increments of the concentration of 2-difluoromethylornithine, a mechanism-based irreversible inhibitor of mammalian ornithine decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.17), resulted in a selection of cultured Ehrlich ascites carcinoma cells capable of growing in the presence of up to 50 mM difluoromethylornithine. Dialyzed extracts of drug-resistant tumor cells exhibited a very high ornithine decarboxylase activity and contained large excess of immunoreactive ornithine decarboxylase protein. Hybridization analyses with cloned complementary DNA revealed that the difluoromethylornithine-resistant tumor cells also expressed mRNA of the enzyme at greatly enhanced rate. The overproduction of ornithine decarboxylase by the tumor cells grown under the pressure of difluoromethylornithine was at least partly attributable to a 10 to 20-fold increase in the total gene dosage of ornithine decarboxylase involving an amplification of several genes of the gene family. The gene amplification developed appeared to be stable, as the gene dosage only slowly (during a period of several months) returned towards the normal level upon the removal of difluoromethylornithine. The overproduction of ornithine decarboxylase was accompanied by an enhanced resistance of the enzyme towards difluoromethylornithine in vitro.
