The control region for the histidine operon of Klebsiella pneumoniae was cloned and analyzed with the Escherichia coli promoter-probe plasmid pPV33. A restriction fragment which contained the his control region was identified by its ability to activate the tetracycline resistance (Tcr) gene on this vector. Expression of Tcr by bacteria containing the his promoter-active plasmid was found to be under the attenuation control of the his promoter. DNA sequence analysis of the his control region revealed a base sequence homology of approximately 86% of the analogous DNA sequences of E. coli and Salmonella typhimurium. Most of the base alterations in the K. pneumoniae DNA sequence were found to reside in regions flanking the transcriptional and translational regulatory sites.
