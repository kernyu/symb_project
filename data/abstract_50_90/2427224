Anti-lymphoma natural resistance (NR) has been detected in DBA/2 mice inoculated intravenously (iv) with syngeneic Friend leukemia cells (FLC). Interferon-sensitive 745 or interferon-resistant 3Cl-8 clones, passaged in vitro and exhibiting "low" tumorigenicity in syngeneic DBA/2 mice, were used. NR, measured as rapid clearance of radiolabeled cells from lung and liver of recipient mice, was age-dependent, was boosted by host pretreatment with polyinosinic-polycytidylic (poly I:C) acid or Friend leukemia virus, and was decreased by mice pretreatment with cyclophosphamide or i-carrageenan. Treatment of "target" FLC with interferon suppressed the susceptibility of 745 FLC, but not that of 3Cl-8 FLC to host's NR. These data suggest that the "low" in vivo tumorigenicity of in vitro passaged FLC is, at least in part, due to host's NR directed against target structures associated with leukemia cells.
