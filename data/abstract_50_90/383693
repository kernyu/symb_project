Incompatibility group P-1 plasmids with the bla+ genotype were transferred from various Escherichia coli strains to Pseudomonas acidovorans strain 29. When resistance to ampicillin was used as the criterion, none of these plasmids appeared able to express their Bla+ phenotype in this host. When the plasmids were subsequently transferred back from these ampicillin-sensitive P. acdiovorans transcipients to E. coli strains, it was found that the Bla+ phenotype was again expressed. Although beta-lactamase was not detected in cultures of P. acidovorans transcipients, macroiodometric determinations of beta-lactamase activity made on broken cell suspensions revealed that beta-lactamase was indeed synthesized. It was concluded that P. acidovorans strain 29 allows expression of the bla gene within the cell but that this organism is unable to excrete the enzyme.
