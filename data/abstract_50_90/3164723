Mouse myeloid leukemic M1 cells are induced to differentiate by various differentiation inducers. Activity for inhibition of induction of differentiation of M1 cells (I-factor activity) was detected in conditioned medium of variant M1 cell clones that were resistant to differentiation inducers, and this I-factor activity was shown to be closely associated with resistance of the cells to differentiation inducers. In this work, the I-factor was purified to apparent homogeneity from conditioned medium of resistant M1 cells. The purification procedure consisted of ammonium sulfate precipitation, CM-Sepharose CL-6B, Sephadex G-200, reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography on a C18 hydrophobic support, and high-performance liquid chromatography on a gel filtration column. The factor was analyzed by radioiodination, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and autoradiography. The purified factor gave a single band of protein with a molecular weight of 68,000 on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis which coincided with its biological activity. The concentration of I-factor required for 50% inhibition of dexamethasone-induced differentiation of M1 cells was 24 pM. At its effective concentration it had no effect on cell proliferation, and even at 1.2 nM it did not inhibit colony formation of normal bone marrow cells, suggesting that it was distinct from the inhibitor of normal precursors of macrophages and/or granulocytes.
