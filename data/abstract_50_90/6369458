Ceftazidime, a broad spectrum cephalosporin antibiotic with an enhanced anti-pseudomonal activity, was tested in vitro against a variety of reptilian bacterial isolates. Blood concentrations of this antibiotic were determined in clinically ill snakes following an intramuscular injection at a dose rate of 20 mg kg-1. Peak plasma levels of up to 70.5 micrograms ml-1 were reached one to eight hours after the injection and therapeutic plasma levels were maintained for at least 96 hours. A series of snakes treated with ceftazidime at a dose rate of 20 mg kg-1 every 72 hours showed a rapid and obvious clinical response to treatment. The snakes were maintained at 30 degrees C during treatment and the effect of environmental temperature on antibiotic half-life is discussed. Ceftazidime proved to be a highly active antibiotic against the bacteria known to cause disease in reptiles, with no obvious adverse effects having been so far described.
