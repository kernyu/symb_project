A cold-sensitive, streptomycin-sensitive mutant of Saccharomyces cerevisiae accumulates a 28S ribonucleoprotein particle when grown at low temperature. This particle contains 17S ribosomal ribonculeic acid which is degraded when exposed to ribonuclease. The particle does not serve as a precursor to 60 and 40S ribosomal subunits nor is it turned over when growth is allowed to resume at the permissive temperature; rather it is only diluted by growth. That streptomycin sensitivity (allelic with cold sensitivity) is ribosomal is evidenced by the inhibition of protein synthesis in vitro by streptomycin and the binding of labeled streptomycin to the mutant but not the parental 40S ribosomal subunit.
