Sensitivity of 6 F. tularensis strains to 57 antibiotics and synthetic antibacterial drugs was studied. It was shown that the strains were highly sensitive to aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, anzamycins, quinolones, chloramphenicol, nitrofurantoin, nitroxoline, novobiocin and fusidin and resistant to penicillins, cephalosporins, polypeptides, vancomycin and sulfanylamides. The interrace differences in F. tularensis could be detected only by sensitivity to erythromycin, oleandomycin and spiramycin. There was observed no cross resistance to streptomycin and other aminoglycosides in F. tularensis. Assay of F. tularensis sensitivity to antibacterial drugs of various groups with the rapid photometric procedure and the agar diffusion method revealed that the results were highly comparable.
