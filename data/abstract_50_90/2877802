The purpose of the study was to investigate the effect of foschlor on erythrocytes and leucocytes in two breeds of rabbits--Belgian and black-and-tan. Administration of the pesticide caused a considerable drop in the number of erythrocytes, haemoglobin level and haematocrit value in both breeds. Changes in the values of red blood cell indices, characterized by an increase in mean erythrocyte volume and haemoglobin content in blood cells, were observed in the black-and-tan breed only. The pesticide used caused changes in leucocytes in both breeds, expressed as a distinct neutrophilic leucocytosis with lymphopaenia and eosinopaenia. Changes in the leucogram were reflected in the increase in the leucocyte index. The degree of intensity of the changes in both erythrocytes and leucocytes points to the greater resistance of the Belgian breed to intoxication by foschlor than the black-and-tan breed.
