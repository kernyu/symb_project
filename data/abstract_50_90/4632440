We have presented a new approach to studying bacteriophage T4 head maturation. Using a modified M-band technique, we have shown that progeny deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) was synthesized on the host cell membrane throughout infection. This DNA was released from the membrane later in infection as the result of formation of the phage head; detachment of the DNA required the action of gene products 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 31, 16, 17 and 49, known to be necessary for normal head formation. Gene products 2, 4, 50, 64, 65, 13 and 14, also involved in head morphogenesis were not required to detach progeny DNA from the membrane; the presence of the phage tail and tail fibers also was not required. DNA was released in the form of immature heads and initially was sensitive to deoxyribonuclease (DNase). Conversion to DNase resistance followed rapidly. The amount of phage precursors present at the time of DNA synthesis determined the time of onset and detachment rate of DNA from the M band as well as the kinetics by which the detached DNA become DNase resistant.
