A strain of Trichostrongylus colubriformis from Nottingham Road, in Natal, was found to be solidly resistant to levamisole and morantel at the recommended dose levels. Untreated control sheep in fact harboured fewer worms at slaughter than either of the 2 treated groups. In contrast, the benzimidazoles and ivermectin were more than 99.9% effective against this worm strain. The possible implications of escalating resistance to anthelmintics in the gastrointestinal nematodes of sheep are discussed.
