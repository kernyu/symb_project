We have attempted to introduce a neomycin-resistance gene, recombined in a murine (ecotropic) Moloney retrovirus, into HEp2 human cells which are resistant to infection by this retrovirus. To allow the binding of the retroviral vector on HEp2 cells, we have tested several antibody constructions between two monoclonal antibodies, one (mAb 5E9) directed against the human transferrin receptor and the other (mAb 615) directed against the gp70 envelope viral protein. The crosslinking of mAbs 5E9 and 615 by a sheep anti-murine kappa light chain antibody allowed the binding of virus on HEp2 cells. After incubation at 37 degrees, virus was internalized by HEp2 cells. However, no neomycin-resistant colonies of HEp2 cells have been obtained under various conditions. Our results suggest that binding and internalization of a retrovirus are not sufficient for establishment of the proviral state in cells which do not express a specific receptor.
