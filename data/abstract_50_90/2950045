The prevalence of penicillinase producing Neisseria gonorrhoeae (PPNG) strains has been steadily rising in Nigeria since 1979, and now about 80% of the strains of gonococci isolated in Ibadan are found to produce penicillinase. Spectinomycin has consequently become widely used in treating these infections. To ascertain the emergence of spectinomycin resistance, this study was undertaken to assess the in vivo susceptibilities of gonococcal strains to spectinomycin and other common antibiotics. Five hundred and twenty seven isolates were tested, of which 452 (85.5%) were PPNG strains. None of the strains were found to be resistant to 100 micrograms spectinomycin discs in vitro, whereas all 370 patients treated with the antibiotic were bacteriologically cured. Plasmid analysis shows that both "Asian" and "African" PPNG types are circulating in Nigeria. For the moment spectinomycin remains highly effective in treating gonococcal infections in west Africa.
