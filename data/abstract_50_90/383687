Strains were constructed that contain mutational alterations affecting two distinct functional domains within the araC gene protein. The araCi (catabolite repression insensitivity) and araCh (catabolite repression hypersensitivity) mutations were used to alter the catabolite repression sensitivity domain, and mutation to D-fucose resistance was used to alter the inducer binding domain. araCh, D-fucose-resistant double mutants never exhibited constitutive ara operon expression, whereas all of the araCi, D-fucose-resistant double mutants did exhibit constitutivity. When L-arabinose was used as an inducer, most of the double mutants exhibited the sensitivity to catabolite repression associated with the araCi or araCh mutation. However, when D-fucose was used as an inducer, changes in sensitivity to catabolite repression were observed that were attributed to interactions between the two protein domains. The roles of catabolite activator protein and araC gene protein in the induction of the araBAD operon were discussed.
