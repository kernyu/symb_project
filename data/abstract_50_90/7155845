Dibekacin is a new aminoglycoside derived semi-synthetically from kanamycin B. Its in vitro antibacterial activity, evaluated by the study of 43 reference strains and 1,177 clinical isolates, was found to be very similar to that of gentamicin, tobramycin, sisomicin and netilmicin on strains sensitive to these aminoglycosides; in the case of strains carrying plasmidic resistance factors, dibekacin behaves like tobramycin; it is inactivated by the same bacterial enzymes.
