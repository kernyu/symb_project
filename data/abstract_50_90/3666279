1. Human lactoferrin and transferrin are capable of binding two iron or copper ions into specific binding sites in the presence of bicarbonate. 2. Urea and several alkyl ureas have been effective in unfolding these metal-protein complexes. 3. Biphasic transitions are observed for the unfolding of each of the metal complexes of these proteins as determined by direct visible spectroscopy suggesting the release of iron(III) and Cu(II) ions from both of these metal-binding proteins during the unfolding process. 4. Greater stabilization and increased resistance to protein unfolding is observed for all iron(III) complexes compared to Cu(II) complexes of lactoferrin and transferrin as determined by isothermal unfolding and thermal denaturation. 5. Relative stabilization of the different metal-protein complexes investigated within this study were determined to be as follows: Lf-Fe(III) greater than Lf-Cu(II); Tf-Fe(III) greater than Tf-Cu(II), and Lf-Fe(III) greater than Tf-Fe(III); Lf-Cu(II) greater than Tf-Cu(II).
