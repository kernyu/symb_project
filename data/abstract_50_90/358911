Proteus strains isolated from the gastro-intestinal tract of children not older than 1 year were characterized by resistance to oxytetracycline, chlortetracycline, benzylpenicillin and erythromycin. The strains were more sensitive to neomycin, monomycin and streptomycin. Antibiotic sensitivity of Pr. mirabilis and Pr. vulgaris strains increased on transfer from H- to O-form. Inverse dependence of the urease activity of the strains on their sensitivity to tetracyclines was noted.
