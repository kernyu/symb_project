Four hundred fifty one urine samples from patients with renal transplant and 2,943 from nontransplanted patients were evaluated. Streptococcus pneumoniae grew in 22 samples from the transplanted group (4.9%) and in 24 from the nontransplanted group (0.8%) (p less than 0.001). The number of isolated CFU/ml was usually low, with mean values of 5.4 x 1,000 CFU/ml and 2.8 x 1,000 CFU/ml in both populations, respectively; 47.8% of strains were resistant or moderately sensitive to penicillin, and 56.5% and 60% were resistant to co-trimoxazole and norfloxacin, respectively. All were sensitive to nitrofurantoin and rifampin.
