Loutit, J. S. (University of Otago, Dunedin, N.Z.), and L. E. Pearce. Kinetics of mating of FP(+) and FP(-) strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. J. Bacteriol. 90:425-430. 1965.-Recently, we reported the variability of the FP(+) x FP(-) mating in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and the increase in efficiency when the cells were mated after dilution. The present work shows that when standardized cells were mated after a dilution of 10(-2) for FP(-) and 2 x 10(-3) for FP(+), there was less variability in the system. Investigation of pairing between FP(+) and FP(-) cells, as measured by genetic transfer, revealed that none took place during 24 hr in liquid media in which growth of both parents was possible. Transfer in liquid minimal medium was not investigated, because the single marker in the male was insufficient to control back mutation in 24 hr. No transfer occurred on solid media which allowed full growth of both FP(+) and FP(-) cells. Transfer took place very slowly on minimal agar, requiring 19 to 20 hr. It is thought that this represents growth of microcolonies with eventual transfer when internal nutrients were exhausted.
