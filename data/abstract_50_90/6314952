Acyclovir is a potent and selective antiviral agent. Unfortunately, drug-resistant (acyclovir-resistant) mutants have already been reported in herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) orofacial infections. We have developed a laboratory acyclovir-resistant HSV-1 mutant. The natural course of acyclovir-resistant HSV-1 keratitis was found to be less virulent than that observed in wild type HSV-1 keratitis, but the rate of ganglionic latency was as high as that induced by the parental strain. In vitro studies and in vivo observation of rabbit corneas infected with acyclovir-resistant HSV-1 both demonstrated a significant sensitivity to vidarabine and bromovinyldeoxyuridine ([E]-5-[2-bromovinyl]-2'-deoxyuridine). The thymidine kinase activity of the acyclovir-resistant mutant was 69% of that of the wild type HSV-1.
