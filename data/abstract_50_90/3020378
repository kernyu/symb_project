Four Tn5 mutations able to express streptomycin resistance in E. coli were obtained independently. These mutations (called Tn5) were localized and sequenced. All of them consist of a 6 bp deletion in the str gene near the 3' end. The mutation affects a region peculiar for its repetition of an identical 6 bp sequence. The mutation does not affect the level of transcription of the kan, ble, str operon of Tn5, neither does it increase the level of translation of str. The mutation seems to interfere with a post-translational event.
