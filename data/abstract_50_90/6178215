A combined preparation for influenza prevention (CPIP) consisting of an interferon inducer stimulating immunogenesis and killed influenza vaccine is proposed. Twenty five inducers-stimulators have been tested: polynucleotides, polysaccharide and lipopolysaccharide extracted from Salmonella typhosa. Intranasal administration of CPIP to laboratory animals markedly stimulates interferon, secretory, and circulating antibody synthesis. Resistance to fatal influenza infection develops within 18 hours after administration of CPIP and its intensity increases in the following 14 days (the observation period.
