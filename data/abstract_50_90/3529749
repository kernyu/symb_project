More than 7,000 bacteriological samples were received by the authors and were analysed for the frequency of resistance among pyogenic cocci which are relevant to surgical practice. Staphylococcus aureus accounted for 41 per cent and Escherichia coli for 15.3 per cent. These were the most common germs in 1984. Resistance of Staphylococcus aureus to ampicillin was as high as 78 per cent. Resistance levels below eight per cent were recorded in the context of lincomycin, erythromycin, gentamicin, oxacillin, and berlocombin. Resistance ratios of Escherichia coli were 55.2 per cent to ampicillin, 4.5 per cent to gentamicin, and 12.6 per cent to berlocombin.
