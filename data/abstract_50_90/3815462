Cefotaxime at a dosage of 3 gm intravenously every eight hours was administered to 80 patients with hematological malignancies and suspected septicemia. Blood samples for culturing were taken before and during antibiotic therapy. Nineteen patients had verified bacteremia and ten of them responded completely to cefotaxime. Twelve of the 19 patients had granulocyte counts of less than 0.5 X 10(9)/L. Minimal inhibitory concentrations of cefotaxime, ceftazidime, moxalactam, cefsulodin, cefoxitin, cefuroxime, and cefamandole against the pathogens were measured: cefotaxime was the best cephalosporin against gram-negative isolates and was found acceptable against gram-positive bacteria. In 61 patients no bacteremia could be demonstrated, but specific pathogens were isolated in 11 patients: from the urine in five, from the sputum in five, and from a perianal abscess in one. Complete response was obtained with cefotaxime in seven of these 11 patients. Monotherapy with cefotaxime in septicemic patients with hematological malignancies appears to be a valuable alternative to other antibiotic regimens.
