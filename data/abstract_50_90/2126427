Cross-linked collagen bioprostheses usually are designed to be inert and nonresorbable, resulting in fatigue and wear failure in high-stress environments. Eventual replacement of the implant, although minimizing strength loss during resorption, would result in a graft with reparative ability. Kangaroo tail tendon (KTT) partially cross-linked with glutaraldehyde (GA) was evaluated in vitro for resistance to bacterial collagenase digestion and in vivo for biocompatibility and resorbability in an intramuscular implant assay. Cross-linking was quantified by thermal denaturation studies. Incomplete cross-linking was achieved with concentrations of GA less than 0.1% (w/v). KTT cross-linked in greater than or equal to 0.05% GA were collagenase resistant being incompletely digested after 240 h. Cross-linking of KTT with low concentrations of GA resulted in partial collagenase resistance and slowed resorption.
