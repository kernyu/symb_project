CL 118523 is an aminothiazolyl cephalosporin which contains a 1, 2, 3-thiadiazol radical at position 3 of the cephem nucleus. It was as active as cefotaxime, ceftazidime and aztreonam against most Enterobacteriaceae, MIC 90% less than 1 mg/l, and more active, 8 to 32-fold, than cefoperazone and cefoxitin. Enterobacter species resistant to the other agents were resistant to CL 118523. CL 118523 did not inhibit Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas maltophilia, MIC greater than 128 mg/l. It had excellent activity against hemolytic streptococci of groups A, B, C, and G, and methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, but failed to inhibit enterococci and methicillin-resistant staphylococci. CL 118523 was minimally hydrolyzed by plasmid and chromosomally-mediated beta-lactamases, and was a poor beta-lactamase inducer.
