A multidrug resistant variant (H69AR) of the human small cell lung cancer cell line NCI-H69 was obtained by culturing these cells in gradually increasing doses of Adriamycin up to 0.8 microM after a total of 14 months. H69AR expresses the multidrug resistant phenotype because it is cross-resistant to anthracycline analogues including daunomycin, epirubicin, menogaril, and mitoxantrone as well as to acivicin, etoposide, gramicidin D, colchicine, and the Vinca alkaloids, vincristine and vinblastine. H69AR is also similar to other multidrug resistant cell lines in that it displays little or no cross-resistance to bleomycin, 5-fluorouracil, and carboplatin. It has a slight collateral sensitivity to 1-dehydrotestosterone and lidocaine. H69AR has increased cell-cell adhesiveness compared to H69, but a similar growth rate in vitro and tumorigenicity in nude mice. When cultured in the absence of Adriamycin, there is a 40% decrease in resistance by 35 days of culture, compared to cells in continuous culture in drug, but no further decrease in resistance up to 181 days. Monoclonal antibodies to P-glycoprotein have no detectable reactivity with H69AR cells as determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunoblotting techniques. Thus, unlike most multidrug resistant cell lines, H69AR does not appear to express enhanced levels of P-glycoprotein. H69AR will provide a useful model for the study of multidrug resistance in human small cell lung cancer.
