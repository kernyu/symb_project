Following the employment of trimethoprim/sulfonamid and gentamicin in the general clinical praxis transferable plasmids with respective resistance function were identified at first in enteric bacteria from sewage before they could be detected in patient strains. Whereas the trimethoprim resistance plasmids represent different incompatibility groups (C, FII, I5, K, M, N, S, U) the gentamicin resistance plasmids are very similar IncM members of 62 MD in size. Therefore a clonal distribution of a particular gentamicin resistance plasmid has to be taken into consideration.
