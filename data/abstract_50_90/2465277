Previous work has shown that murine lymphoma cells antigenically altered ("xenogenized") by drug treatment elicit strong in vivo resistance to the original cells. Moreover, splenocytes immune to a drug-treated variant (L5178Y/DTIC) of a murine lymphoma exert anti-parental tumor activity in an adoptive transfer system, an effect mediated by L3T4+ lymphocytes and associated with the detection of an anti-L5178Y delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) response. We now report that the in vivo activity of the tumor-immune L3T4+ lymphocytes is a radio-sensitive (2,500 rad in vitro) phenomenon that requires collaboration with radio-resistant, silica-sensitive syngeneic cells in the host, and is inhibited by treatment of recipient mice with monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) to the L3T4 antigen or murine interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma). In vitro, the tumor-immune L3T4+ lymphocytes produce interleukin 2 (IL-2), lymphotoxin (LT) and IFN-gamma activities on incubation with L5178Y cells and spleen-adherent cells. These results suggest that the mechanisms of anti-parental tumor protection by xenogenized cells involve specific induction of a DTH response mediated by the "inflammatory" (THI) subset of L3T4+ T lymphocytes and IFN-gamma activated macrophages.
