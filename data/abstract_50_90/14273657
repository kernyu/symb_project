Hansen, A. J. (University of Idaho, Moscow), O. B. Weeks, and R. R. Colwell. Taxonomy of Pseudomonas piscicida (Bein) Buck, Meyers, and Leifson. J. Bacteriol. 89:752-761. 1965.-Twenty strains of marine bacteria showing the properties of pigmentation and icthyotoxicity were studied for selected physiological features. A quantitative taxonomic analysis with an electronic computer was performed. Eighteen species of Pseudomonas were included in the computer analysis as reference strains. The marine collection formed a homogeneous cluster, 80% similarity, and showed a 67 to 70% similarity to certain of the Pseudomonas species: P. atlantica, P. geniculata, P. synxantha, and P. taetrolens. The marine strains are treated as a phenon describing the species P. piscicida. The species was characterized by the hypothetical Median Organism concept; P. piscicida 14 corresponded most closely to the Median Organism.
