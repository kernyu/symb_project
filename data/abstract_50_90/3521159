In 4 S. marcescens polyresistant strains isolated from patients conjugative plasmids transferred to Escherichia coli have been detected. Two of these strains carry each one plasmid which codes resistance to 10 different antibiotics, including aminoglycosides which rarely occur in our country, and belongs to group IncC. The third strain is the host of 2 plasmids. One of them is similar to the above-mentioned 2 plasmids with respect to the incompatibility group and a set of markers, but additionally codes resistance to cephalosporins; the second plasmid has been determined as belonging to group IncM, unstable and capable of rendering the cells highly resistant only to aminoglycosides. And, finally, the fourth strain also carries 2 plasmids: one of them is unstable and belongs, supposedly, to group IncI alpha, and the second plasmid is stable and belongs to group IncM. The plasmid of group IncI alpha differs from all other plasmids of our Serratia by its capacity of rendering the cells highly resistant to chloramphenicol.
