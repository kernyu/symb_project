Studies have been made on viability and hereditary properties of the progeny of amoebae after micrurgical coercions (sectioning of cells, suction of cytoplasm) during metaphase and early anaphase. The progeny of the fragments as well as of the cells with the reduced bulk of the cytoplasm exhibits unusual methionine resistance. Possible mechanism of the observed phenomemon are discussed.
