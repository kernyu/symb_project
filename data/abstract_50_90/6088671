The aminoglycoside phosphotransferase (APH)(3')(5'')-III has been characterized from Streptococcus pneumoniae BM4200, which is resistant to high levels of aminoglycosides. The phosphotransferase was apparently chromosomally-encoded and was responsible for the high-level resistance. The enzyme was not notably pH-dependent, was heterogeneous after isoelectric focusing, with pI values of approximately 4.8 and 5.1, and had an apparent molecular weight of 32 500 after SDS-PAGE.
