Frequently side effects of drugs are the reason for hospital admission. According to various studies 8-35% of drugs have side effects, which may be more acceptable in the context of serious disease than milder illnesses or situations where drugs are not really necessary. Side effects are seen independently of dosage, often with dosages too low to be effective. Since antibiotic therapy is widely used in children side effects are often seen. There are allergic or immunoreactive reactions of the immediate and delayed type, metabolic and neural or neurohormonal disturbances, built-up of resistant organisms or selection of unusual bacteria, finally there is local damage due to the technique of application here not discussed in detail. The antibiotics are classified according to the type and frequency of side effects: Cephalosporine and Penicillin - allergic and neurotoxic reactions. Tetracycline - chelating agent, photosensitivity. Chloramphenicol - bone marrow depression. Aminoglycoside - oto- and nephrotoxicity. Macrolid antibiotics e.g. streptomycin - cholostasis. Lincomycin - enterocolitis. Sulfonamides - allergic reactions. How compliance with consequent irregularity of drug intake frequently causes ineffectiveness of therapy, the most common side effect.
