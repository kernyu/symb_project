The antibiotic therapy of oral infections requires bactericidal concentrations in the oral environment over sufficient time. Comparable determination of antibiotica concentration in the saliva of 8 human volunteers were made after oral application of Amoxycillin and Clindamycin. Only Clindamycin showed inhibitory concentrations.--When pharmacokinetic characteristics and the present status of resistance were considered, Clindamycin is viewed as an antibiotic of choice for oral infections.
