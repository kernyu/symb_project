This study analysed the suramin sensitivity of 29 stocks of Trypanosoma evansi isolated from Egypt, Sudan, and Indonesia and compared the results with the isoenzyme banding patterns of 20 soluble enzymes in these stocks of T. evansi. The results showed that the type VII banding pattern of malic enzyme was found only in T. evansi stocks which were highly resistant to suramin.
