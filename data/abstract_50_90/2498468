The aims of this work were to investigate the possible effect of several antimicrobial agents alone and in combinations against 190 clinical isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and 30 isolates of Mycobacterium avium, 30 Mycobacterium fortuitum and 30 Mycobacterium chelonei. The susceptibility was determined in Muller-Hinton agar and Middlebrook 7H 10 agar. For interpretation of the results the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined and for the combinations of antimicrobials we used the Fractional Inhibitory Concentration Index (FIC). The possible clinical efficacy was determined by the Inhibitory Quotient. The synergistic effect of several combinations of these compounds was demonstrated.
