Chloramphenicol-resistant strains of Salmonella typhi (MIC 60 micrograms/ml), chloramphenicol and ampicillin-resistant strains of Salmonella typhimurium as well as multiresistant strains of various salmonella serotypes were found to be very sensitive to cephradine (MIC 0.078-0.625 micrograms/ml). Ten patients with Salmonella typhi bacteremia were successfully treated with cephradine; all the patients' strains were chloramphenicol-resistant. Cephradine appears to warrant further clinical trial for the treatment of salmonellosis.
