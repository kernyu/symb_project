Clonal evolution which characterizes malignant tumors is the consequence of two antagonizing forces acting on the tumor cell population, namely, forces of diversion and conversion. The former makes cells to diverge through genetic and epigenetic instabilities which are the built-in characteristics of malignant cells. Possible causes of genetic instability are discussed. These include mistakes in DNA synthesis by an error-prone DNA polymerase, the nucleotide pool distartion and the overreplication of replication origins, abnormal DNA repair, high rate recombination, by expression of fragile sites and possibly by expression of retrotransposons, frequent nondisjunction of chromosomes as a consequence of gene dosage inbalance, and abnormal DNA methylation. The second force makes the resulting tumor cell population with heterogenous phenotypes to converge through selection by host defence mechanisms, competition for nutrients and oxygen among tumor cells, to cell interactions within tumor and between surrounding normal tissues. Genetic tagging of tumor cells with pSV 2neo facilitates the analysis of clonal evolution which results from diversion and conversion of tumor cells. Selective growth and metastasis of a clone in a mouse sarcoma population was demonstrated. Generation of dominant clones as well as drug resistant clones in tumor can be studied with this method.
