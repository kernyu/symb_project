One hundred twenty-two patients were evaluated prospectively to determine the clinical efficacy of prophylactic cefazolin (Ancef) in cesarean section. The cefazolin was administered intravenously in a high-dose, short perioperative regimen. Postoperatively, each patient was evaluated for morbidity. Over all, the post operative morbidity rate was reduced from 30 per cent in the placebo group to 18 per cent in the cefazolin group. More important, the infection rate associated with primary cesarean section was significantly lessened from 38 per cent in the placebo group to 16 per cent in the drug group (p less than 0.025). In repeat cesarean sections, the postoperative morbidity rate was greater in the antibiotic-treated group (20 per cent) than in the placebo group (14 per cent). Of major importance, a predominant organism, Group D streptococcus, was encountered in the postoperative cultures of the cefazolin group.
