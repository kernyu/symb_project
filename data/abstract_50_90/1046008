Five aminoglycosides were tested for inhibitory activity on 91 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, 39 of which were methicillin-resistant. The antistaphylococcal activity of these antibiotics was independent of the methicillin-resistance. Their order of decreasing effectiveness was: gentamicin greater than tobramycin = sisomicin greater than amikacin greater than kanamycin. Resistant strains were only found for the latter.
