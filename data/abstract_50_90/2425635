Active Na+ absorption by the rat proximal colon in vivo is for the most part electrically silent. The rheogenic Na+ flux makes up only 8%. To elucidate the underlying transport pathways, the following experimental approaches were used: ion substitution experiments such as choline for Na+, cyclamate for Cl-, variation of luminal pH; administration of known inhibitors; and determination of changes in luminal CO2 tension and pH. The transcolonic ion fluxes as well as the electrical parameters potential difference, specific electrical resistance, and short-circuit current were monitored. Na+ transport was drastically reduced in the absence of luminal Cl-, and vice versa Cl- absorption was blocked at zero Na+. NaCl absorption was blocked by amiloride (10(-3) M) and 4-acetamido-4'-isothiocyanostilbene-2, 2'-disulfonic acid and was lowered by acetazolamide. Colonic NaCl absorption was not influenced by luminal furosemide. Na+ absorption increased with alkalinization of the luminal fluid. Tris instead of HCO-3 buffer at constant pH favored Cl- uptake. The results may easily be explained by the operation of a Na+-H+ antiport functionally coupled to a Cl(-)-HCO-3 antiport. These transport processes are supposed to be present in the columnar cells of the colonic epithelium. There is good evidence for the association of K+ secretion with rheogenic Cl- secretion by the crypt cells.
