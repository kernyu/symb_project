Escherichia coli, harboring the temperature-sensitive drug-resistant factor Rts 1, formed filaments on solid medium at the nonpermissive temperature (42 C). In addition, the rate of adsorption of T4D phage progressively decreased during growth at 42 C. Susceptibility to a variety of antibiotics increased suggesting that the permeability barrier to these antibiotics may be disrupted at the nonpermissive temperature. These observations were interpreted to suggest that the target of the temperature-sensitive Rts 1 gene product responsible for altering host growth may be the cell envelope.
