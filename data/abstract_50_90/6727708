Two hundred twenty-six strains of Vibrio anguillarum collected from cultured ayu ( Plecoglossus altivelis ) between 1978 and 1980 were studied for their sensitivities to 10 chemotherapeutics. In order to determine whether the drug-resistant strains possessed transferable R plasmids, they were conjugated with Escherichia coli. Almost all the strains isolated during the 3 years showed resistance to nalidixic acid (NA) and/or furazolidone (NF). NA and NF resistance were not transferred to Escherichia coli from any of the strains. Chloramphenicol-resistant strains were isolated in every year and almost all of them carried transferable R plasmids. Only one strain with tetracycline resistance was found among the strains tested. Strains resistant to sulfonamides, streptomycin, ampicillin (ABP), and trimethoprim (TMP) increased rapidly in 1980, and a large number of them carried transferable R plasmids. Transferable R plasmids encoded with resistance to ABP and TMP were detected for the first time in V. anguillarum strains. The R plasmids detected in the strains isolated in 1980 were classified into incompatibility groups E, A, and an untypable group. The R plasmid DNAs were cleaved by EcoRI to yield 11 to 13 fragments. The estimated molecular weights of the R plasmids from the five strains ranged from 97 to 104 M daltons.
