The sensitivity to normal human serum of 91 smooth strains of Escherichia coli isolated from urinary tract infections was determined. Production of hemolysin, which was common and associated primarily with the types O4, O6, O18, and O75, was significantly correlated with high levels of serum resistance, both within the total population and within individual O types. In contrast, serum resistance was not significantly associated with antibiotic resistance (whether transmissible or not), with colicinogeny in general, or with colicin V production in particular. This indicates that the carriage of R and ColV plasmids, shown previously to be capable of conferring increased levels of serum resistance on individual strains of E. coli isolated from other sources, does not play an important part in determining the serum sensitivity of the E. coli population involved in urinary tract infection.
