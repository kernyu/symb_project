From the field of view of own observative and experiences was tried to outline the present situation in leprosy. It is referred to the results of the modern epidemiological, bacteriological, immunological and medicamentous leprosy research which was particularly stimulated under the impression of the increasing DDS-resistance of the leprosy bacteria. At present ambulatory polychemotherapy, sometimes combined with a vaccination technique, is in the centre of the world-wide combat programme against leprosy. In no other infectious disease, however, social-economical points of view are so important as in leprosy and in the opinion of the author they are finally also decisive for an actually successful and permanent combat.
