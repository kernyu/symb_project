Treatment of pyo-inflammatory diseases in patients with diabetes mellitus should be complex, individual and controlled. Obligatory total and local examinations of the organism should be performed with the involvement of cytological, histological bacteriological methods and with determination of alterations of the carbohydrate, protein, water-salt, electrolytic metabolism, acid-base state and non-specific resistance of the organism. It was shown that diadynamophoresis of proteolytic enzymes, sodium thiosulfate, potassium permanganate in the treatment of pyo-destructive diseases in 362 patients with diabetes mellitus accelerated necrolysis of tissues, shortened time of cleaning the wound and thus made the period of treatment at the hospital shorter.
