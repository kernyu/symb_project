Omoconazole (CM 8282) is a new synthetic antifungal agent with a spectrum of activity quite similar to that of the imidazole family. Fungistatic activity of this product was compared to that of the six following reference products: clotrimazole, econazole, isoconazole, ketoconazole, miconazole, and tioconazole. MICs against 55 recent clinical yeast isolates were determined by agar dilution on pH 5.5-adjusted Sabouraud and casitone media. MIC 90% values showed that tioconazole was the most active product, followed by omoconazole and econazole, whereas ketoconazole was the least active compound under our experimental conditions.
