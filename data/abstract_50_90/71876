The possibilities of antibacterial therapy in the clinics of burn diseases has at present decreased because of increasing microflora resistance to antibiotics. This phenomenon is one of the most often causes of antibacterial drug side effects in burn patients. For control of infections complications in burn patients which are most often lethal it is necessary to use biologically active subtance, such as prodigiozan and lysozime in addition to the directed antibiotic therapy. The use of specific antitoxic antistaphylococcal drugs, such as antistaphylococcal plasma and antistaphylococcal gamma-globulin in combination with the antibiotics of the direct action provided effective control of infectious complications and sepsis of staphylococcal genesis in burn patients. Decamine proved to be effective along with the usual use of nystatin in cases with dysbacteriosis as a result of the antibiotic side effects. In the patients treated with decamine the sings of candidosis disappeared by the 5th--7th day. Therefore, for decreasing the side effects of antibiotics in the clinics of burn patients it is expedient to use antibiotics in combination with the biologically active and immune preparations which increases the efficacy of antibiotic therapy, impfoves the treatment results and decreases the antibiotic side effects.
