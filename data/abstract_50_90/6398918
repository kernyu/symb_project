The efficacy of mefloquine against Plasmodium falciparum in continuous culture was studied. The development of mefloquine resistance in P. falciparum was significantly inhibited by a combination of mefloquine, pyrimethamine and sulfadoxine. By contrast, more resistant variants were selected in continuous culture without drug pressure or with pyrimethamine-sulfadoxine pressure. The most mefloquine resistant variants were selected by step-wise increases in mefloquine pressure.
