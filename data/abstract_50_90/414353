Since January 1972 Neisseria gonorrhoeae has been systematically investigated by culture techniques at the Institute for Hygiene and Medical Microbiology of the University of Berne. From January 1st 1972 to September 30th 1977, 820 strains were isolated. A survey of the sensitivity of gonococci to penicillin G is presented. We found three groups: 1. 700 sensitive strains (85.4%), 2. 118 strains with decreased sensitivity (14,4%), 3.2 resistant strains (0.2%). The two penicillin-resistant strains are described. Only the patients infected with gonococci of the third group were untreatable with penicillin. In view of the present epidemiological situation penicillin remains the drug of choice. However, bacteriological examination including sensitivity tests is urgently recommended and is absolutely indicated in the event of treatment failures. In addition, culture is necessary to rule out gonorrhea because the asymptomatic form is observed with increasing frequency not only in female patients but recently also in male patients.
