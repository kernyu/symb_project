In pneumococcal transformation the frequency of recombinants between point mutations is generally proportional to distance. We have recently described an aberrant marker in the amiA locus that appeared to enhance recombination frequency when crossed with any other allele of this gene. The hyperrecombination that we have observed in two-point crosses could be explained by two hypotheses: the aberrant marker induces frequent crossovers in its vicinity or the mutant is converted to wild type. In this report we present evidence showing that, in suitable three-point crosses, this hyperrecombination does not modify the recombination frequency between outside markers, suggesting that a conversion occurs at the site of this mutation. To estimate the length over which this event occurs, we isolated very closely linked markers and used them in two-point crosses. It appears that the conversion system removes only a few base pairs (from three to 27) around the aberrant marker. This conversion process is quite different from the mismatch-repair system controlled by hex genes in pneumococcus, which involves several thousand base pairs. Moreover, we have constructed artificial heteroduplexes using separated DNA strands. It appears that only one of the two heteroduplexes is specifically converted. The conversion system acts upon 5'..ATTAAT..3'/3'.. TAAGTA..5'. A possible role of the palindrome resulting from the mutation is discussed.
