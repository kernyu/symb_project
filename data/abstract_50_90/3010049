An allele (oliC31) of the A. nidulans oliC gene has been cloned using homology with the equivalent gene from N. crassa. OliC31 codes for an oligomycin-resistant, triethyltin-hypersensitive form of subunit 9 of the mitochondrial ATP synthase complex. Direct selection for oligomycin-resistance was possible following transformation of A. nidulans with the oliC31 gene. The phenotypes of transformants cultured in the presence of oligomycin were indicative of the position of integration of the transforming plasmid within the genome. Subsequent recombination events involving the integrated oliC31 gene were also apparent from altered levels of resistance to oligomycin or triethyltin. This gene should prove useful as a marker for transformation of strains lacking auxotrophic lesions and in gene replacement or disruption experiments.
