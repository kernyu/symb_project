A new antibiotic, lysocellin (K-5610), WAS ISOLATED FROM Streptomyces cacaoi var. asoensis K-9 Met-. Lysocellin was obtained as a colorless crystalline needles from both the cultural filtrate and the mycelium of the organism. The antibiotic melted at 158 similar to 160 degrees C and had a molecular formula C34H59O10Na-1/2H2O. It had antimicrobial activity against gram-positive bacteria, antibiotic-resistant Staphyloccus aureus and some fungi, but not against gram-negative bacteria. Based on its physico-chemical and biological properties lysocellin was identified as a new polyether antibiotic.
