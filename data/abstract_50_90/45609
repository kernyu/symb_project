Compound Hoe 15,030 is an analogue of berenil which is as effective as berenil in inducing petite mutants in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Hoe 15,030 has greater stability than berenil in aqueous solution, and is less toxic to yeast at high drug concentrations. Mutants of S. cerevisiae strain J69-1B have been isolated which are resistant to the petite inducing effects of Hoe 15,030. Three mutant strains (HR7, HR8 and HR10) were characterized and each was shown to carry a recessive nuclear mutation determining resistance to Hoe 15,030. The degree of resistance to Hoe 15,030 is different for each mutant, and each was found to be co-ordinately cross-resistant both to berenil and to another analogue of berenil, Hoe 13,548. However, the three mutants show no cross-resistance to other unrelated petite inducing drugs, including ethidium bromide, euflavine and 1-methyl phenyl neutral red. Further studies on the mutants revealed that each strain exhibits characteristic new properties indicative of changes in mitochondrial membrane functions concerned with the replication (and probably also repair) of mitochondrial DNA. Thus, mutant HR7 is hypersensitive to petite induction by the detergent sodium dodecyl sulphate under conditions where the parent J69-1B is unaffected by this agent. Mutant HR8 is even more sensitive to sodium dodecyl sulphate than is HR7, and additionally shows a markedly elevated spontaneous petite frequency. Isolated mitochondria from strains HR8 and HR10 (but not HR7) show resistance to the inhibitory effects of Hoe 15,030 on the replication of mitochondrial DNA in vitro.
