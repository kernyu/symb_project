Cefminox (CMNX), one of newly developed cephamycin antibiotics, was administered to 7 cases of diffuse peritonitis associated with infantile acute appendicitis to determine its concentrations in the blood, the appendiceal tissue and the purulent ascites and simultaneously to investigate its clinical efficacy. CMNX was intravenously injected at a dose of 20 mg/kg (at a maximum amount of 1.0 g/body) before operation and intravenously by bolus injection or by drip infusion twice daily after operation for 3 to 11 days in a total dose of 2.36 to 14.06 g. Fourteen strains of bacteria were isolated from the purulent ascites: Escherichia coli was isolated from 6 cases but superinfections in 5 cases. MICs of CMNX against these isolated organisms were at or lower than 3.13 micrograms/ml for 12 out of 14 strains. CMNX penetrated into the appendiceal tissue and the purulent ascites very well. The concentrations in the pus reached higher than those in the tissue in about 1 hour after administration and were found to reach as high as 9.63 micrograms/ml in 5 hours after administration. Its clinical efficacies were excellent in 4 cases, good in 2 cases and poor in 1 case. No subjective or objective adverse reactions were observed nor any abnormalities were found in laboratory examinations.
