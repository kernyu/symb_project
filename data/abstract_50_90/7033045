The promoter-containing fragments of Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. galleria 69-6 DNA have been cloned on the pGA24 vector in Escherichia coli cells. The recombinant plasmids make cells resistant to tetracycline in a wide range. The level of tetracycline-resistance does not depend on the length of a foreign insertion. New polypeptides are synthesized on the template of the recombinant plasmids in vitro. The data point out the presence in Bac. thuringiensis DNA of many genes which are able to express in E. coli cells.
