Chancroid is a major sexually transmitted disease in many developing countries. Although single-dose and short-course treatment of chancroid have been described, the increasing resistance of Hemophilus ducreyi to antimicrobial agents requires continuing evaluation of new therapies. Ciprofloxacin is a new quinolone antimicrobial agent with excellent in vitro efficacy against H. ducreyi. A double-blind, randomized clinical trial was conducted comparing a single-dose ciprofloxacin regimen (500 mg) and a three-day regimen of ciprofloxacin (500 mg twice daily) with a three-day regimen of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (160 and 800 mg, respectively, twice daily) for the treatment of chancroid. The three-day ciprofloxacin regimen successfully eradicated H. ducreyi, and resulted in rapid clinical improvement in all 40 patients followed, with no failures. The other two regimens were also effective, but bacteriologic and clinical failure occurred in two and three patients following treatment with single-dose ciprofloxacin and three days of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, respectively. All patients with buboes had resolution of lesions. There were no significant adverse effects associated with ciprofloxacin or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. All three regimens are effective therapy for chancroid and H. ducreyi infections. If resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole becomes widespread, ciprofloxacin may become a first-line therapy for chancroid. This study also demonstrates the efficacy of ciprofloxacin in soft tissue infection.
