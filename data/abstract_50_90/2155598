Mice were infected at 4 weeks of age with a type 1 strain of herpes simplex virus (HSV) and re-infected 4 weeks later with either a type 1 or a type 2 strain of HSV. The virus used for first infection could be distinguished from that used later since it was resistant to phosphonoformic acid and formed syncytial plaques. Sites used for the second inoculation were as follows: at the site of primary infection, at a different site within the same dermatome or in the equivalent dermatome on the opposite side (also called "remote" site). Re-infection caused no detectable reactivation of the latent PFA resistant virus. After re-infection with a homotypic virus replication of the re-infecting virus was limited to the inoculation site. However after heterotypic re-infection the type 2 strain was occasionally isolated from the ganglia. Previous infection with the PFA resistant type 1 strain clearly reduced the ability of the homotypic or heterotypic strains to establish a latent infection. However, in a few animals ganglia were found to be latently infected with virus from both the first and second inoculations. Analysis of the results suggests that resistance to the establishment of a second latent infection in a ganglion is determined by the general immunity of the animal rather than "immunity" of the latently infected ganglion itself.
