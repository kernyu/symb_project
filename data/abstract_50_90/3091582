The complete nucleotide sequence of the Staphylococcus epidermidis plasmid pNE131 is presented. The plasmid is 2,355 base pairs long and contains two major open reading frames. A comparison of the pNE131 DNA sequence with the published DNA sequences of five Staphylococcus aureus plasmids revealed strong regional homologies with two of them, pE194 and pSN2. The region of pNE131 containing the reading frame which encodes the constitutive ermM gene is almost identical to the inducible ermC gene region of pE194, except for a 107-base-pair deletion which removes the mRNA leader sequence required for inducible expression. A second region of pNE131 contains an open reading frame with homology to the small cryptic plasmid pSN2 and potentially encodes a 162-amino-acid protein.
