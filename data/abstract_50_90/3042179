The in vitro susceptibility of various Plasmodium falciparum isolates obtained from patients infected in French Guiana was tested in a semi-microtest, using four antimalarial drugs. 90.6% of 32 isolates were resistant to chloroquine, 40% to amodiaquine and 17% to quinine. All the 17 isolates were susceptible to mefloquine.
