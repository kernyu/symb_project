Twenty-three highly antibiotic-resistant strains of Haemophilus influenzae and two of Haemophilus parainfluenzae without detectable large plasmids were examined for conjugative transfer of their resistance to H. influenzae strain Rd or to other strains. Very inefficient transfer was observed for 18 H. influenzae strains and 1 H. parainfluenzae strain. All H. influenzae transcipients carried a large plasmid, and they were in turn efficient donors of their resistances in standard conjugation crosses with isogenic recipients. This was not seen for the H. parainfluenzae transcipients. It is concluded that most of the original antibiotic-resistant cultures carried an integrated conjugative R plasmid which had been excised in a few cells in each population. It was these cells which transferred resistance in the primary crosses.
