The effects of sulfasalazine and its moieties on synthesis of individual products of arachidonic acid metabolism by human colonic mucosa have been investigated. Sulfasalazine inhibited synthesis of the lipoxygenase products. Sulfasalazine and sulfapyridine also inhibited synthesis of thromboxane B2 while enhancing synthesis of prostaglandin (PG) F2 alpha or PGE2, respectively. Inhibition of synthesis of lipoxygenase products and modulation of the profile of cyclooxygenase products could reduce inflammation and enhance mucosal resistance to damage in ulcerative colitis.
