Gram-negative aerobic bacilli (Enterobacteria, Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter) isolated in clinical circumstances at the microbiology of the Claude Bernard Hospital, Paris, are classified according to their resistance to the usual beta-lactam antibiotics routinely tested: ampicillin, carbenicillin, cefalotin. The MICs of mezlocillin were measured on 204 strains and compared to the results obtained with older drugs in each group.
