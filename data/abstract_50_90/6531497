224 salmonella strains from human beings, collected by the public and private laboratories of Ille-et-Vilaine during 1983, were serotyped and tested for their susceptibility to antibiotics. Salmonella typhimurium infections were the most frequent, while the other serotypes constituted a small number of strains, generally susceptible to antibiotics. No outbreak due to a multi-resistant serotype was observed. S. typhi and S. paratyphi B represent 6,25% of the strains isolated in this area during the year. Only 22% of the 224 strains collected were resistant to one or more antibiotics.
