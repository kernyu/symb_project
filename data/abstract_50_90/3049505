Faecal samples were taken weekly from a chosen pen on each of four commercial pig farms, two of which used olaquindox as a feed additive. Coliform bacteria were isolated from the samples and the incidence and level of resistance to olaquindox and to four therapeutic antibiotics determined. The coliforms isolated were biotyped to follow the emergence of drug-resistant sub-populations. The results showed that the coliform flora was complex and that a turnover of biotypes was associated with changes in the occupancy of the pen and, possibly, diet. This turnover led to large fluctuations in both incidence and level of resistance to olaquindox and the antibiotics. Olaquindox resistance was not specifically linked with resistance to any therapeutic antibiotic, and the possible origin of olaquindox-resistant strains is discussed in relation to the biotypes.
