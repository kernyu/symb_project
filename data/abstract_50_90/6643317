Multiple resistance and antibiotic resistance were examined in coliforms isolated at slaughter from the large intestines of two groups of growing pigs that had received antibiotic-free diets since weaning. One group of pigs was from an antibiotic-fed (AB) herd that routinely received chlortetracycline (CTC) in feed, while the other group was from a nonantibiotic-fed (NAB) herd that had not received antibiotics for 8 yr. After a 20-d adjustment period in a common production facility, the mean number of antibiotics in the resistant pattern of isolates from NAB pigs was found to be lower (P less than .05) than that in isolates from AB pigs. The proportions of isolates resistant to ampicillin, kanamycin, neomycin, penicillin, streptomycin and sulfamethizole were lower (P less than .05) in NAB pigs than in AB pigs. Similar herd differences were not observed after pigs from both herds were maintained in a common production facility on an antibiotic-free diet for 105 d. Oral administration of CTC at therapeutic (220 micrograms/g of diet) and at subtherapeutic (27.5 micrograms/g) levels for 14 d increased (P less than .05) the mean numbers of antibiotics in the resistance patterns of isolates from NAB pigs, but did not alter multiple resistance in isolates from AB pigs. After 14 d, subtherapeutic CTC increased the percentage of isolates resistant to ampicillin, kanamycin, penicillin, streptomycin, tetracycline and sulfamethizole, while therapeutic CTC only increased the percentage of isolates from NAB pigs resistant to penicillin, tetracycline and sulfamethizole. Similar antibiotic effects were not seen in isolates from AB pigs after 14 d and were not seen in isolates from either group of pigs at the end of an 85-d feeding trial.
