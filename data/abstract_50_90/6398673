In Manakara and Foulpointe (East Coast of Madagascar) 184 malarial patients were selected among 742 patients attending dispensaries. The 7 days in vivo tests was performed in 144 patients. 13/36 failure to alternative (10 mg/kg) and 1/61 failure to standard (25 mg/kg) chloroquine WHO tests were observed. 10 mg/kg oral amodiaquine failed within 7 days in 5/47 patients. The in vitro semi-microtest was performed with 27 isolates. 2/24 Plasmodium falciparum isolates were chloroquino-resistant (IC50 = 270 and 280 nM/1), 27/27 were sensitive to low doses of amodiaquine (max IC50 = 76 nM/1), 25/25 were very sensitive to dichlorquinazine (max IC50 = 83 nM/1) and with piperaquine 22/24 were very sensitive (IC50 less than 75 nM/1) and 2 less sensitive (IC50 = 240 and greater than 140 nM/1).
