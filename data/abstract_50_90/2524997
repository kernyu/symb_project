The in vitro activities of trospectomycin sulfate were compared with those spectinomycin against 632 aerobic microorganisms, including 66 Neisseria gonorrhoeae isolates. Against species other than gram-negative bacilli, trospectomycin was about 4- to 16-fold more active than spectinomycin. For disk diffusion tests, a 30-micrograms disk is recommended, with tentative zone size breakpoints of less than or equal to 13 mm for resistance (MIC, greater than or equal to 64 micrograms/ml) and greater than or equal to 17 mm for susceptibility (MIC, less than or equal to 16 micrograms/ml).
