This study was done to test effects of indomethacin (IND) on cell damage and prostaglandin (PG) synthesis in mucosal epithelial cells isolated from rat stomach in vitro. IND caused the cell damage in a dose-related way at concentrations over 5 X 10(-4) M. This damage was inhibited by 16,16-dimethyl PGE2 (10(-6) M). IND abolished the synthesis of PGE2, PGI2, and TXA2 at the concentration of 10(-4) M at which IND alone did not cause cell damage. The cells treated with 10(-4) M IND were significantly susceptible to damage caused by 15% ethanol compared to the cells not treated with IND. 16,16-Dimethyl PGE2 also inhibited the damage caused by IND + ethanol. These results suggest that the IND-induced susceptibility of the cells to damage is related to PG deficiency.
