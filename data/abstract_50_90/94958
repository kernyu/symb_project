In contrast to phage lambda the phages T3, T7 and T4 are not inhibited by as much as 150 microgram bleomycin/ml, while the chemically related antibiotic phleomycin increasingly inhibits the propagation of the phages in the order T4-T3-lambda. 20 microgram phleomycin/ml inhibit T3 by 95%. The resistance against bleomycin is surprising, because 10 microgram BM/ml block completely the colony-forming capacity of the host bacterium. The drug resistance of the phage growth correlates with the weak decrease of phage DNA synthesis, while the host cell DNA synthesis ceases rapidly. In accordance with these data is the in vivo inhibition of Escherichia coli cells and the in vitro degradation of their DNA. However, a contradiction exists between the in vivo resistance of T3 and T4 and the in vitro susceptibility of their DNA against nucleolytical fragmentation by bleomycin. The mechanism of the insensitivity of T3, T7 and T4 against bleomycin is unknown.
