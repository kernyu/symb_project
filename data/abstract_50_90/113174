Gonorrhea has been known since antiquity. Today, this disease is the most commonly reported infectious disease in the U.S. The natural environment of the etiological agent, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, is man. In this host, the organism usually parasitizes mucosal surfaces populated by columnar epithelial cells. Under certain conditions, the gonococcus may disseminate or spread to adjacent organs. The gonococcus is well adapted to its environment and is a successful parasite. Until recently, gonococci were uniformly sensitive to penicilin. However, a plasmid encoding beta-lactamase has been identified in some isolates. Most strains exhibit specific requirements for various amino acids, vitamins, purines, and pyrimidines. Only glucose, pyruvate, and lactate are utilized as sources of energy. Glucose is dissimilated by a combination of the Entner-Doudoroff and pentose phosphate pathways. A tricarboxylic acid cycle is also present and active under certain conditions. Structurally, the cell envelope of the gonococcus resembles that of a typical Gram-negative bacterium. Gonococci are highly autolytic, especially in older cultures or after depletion of the energy source. Autolysis is not due solely to peptidoglycan hydrolysis, but appears to involve a destabilization of the outer membrane as well. Cell surface components such as pili, lipopolysaccharide, outer membrane proteins, and a capsule are associated with the virulence and pathogenicity of this organism.
