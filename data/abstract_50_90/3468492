In recent years, new broad-spectrum antibiotics have become available for the treatment of complex pneumonia. Used with care, these agents may allow effective monotherapy of difficult-to-treat pulmonary infections, with the added benefit of decreased toxicity in comparison with the more traditional multiple-drug combinations. The newer antibiotics are relatively expensive, but cost of their use can be justified by their reduced toxicity (in comparison with some antibiotic combinations) and by the avoidance of additional laboratory fees for routine drug monitoring. It is hoped that the major benefits that can accrue with proper use of the newer agents will not be outweighed by problems resulting from their indiscriminate use, such as increased bacterial resistance and exorbitant healthcare costs.
