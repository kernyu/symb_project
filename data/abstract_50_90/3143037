Previous studies have demonstrated the importance of IFN alpha/beta in resistance to primary viral infections. However, the role of IFN gamma in primary infections is unclear. The present studies were undertaken to determine whether IFN gamma induction was an important early host defense against primary HSV infection. The approach was to block the IFN gamma response with antibodies to IFN gamma prior to infection and at various times post-infection (p.i.). The data indicates that treatment of mice with anti-IFN gamma prior to infection enhanced mortality (89% vs 37%). Anti-IFNs given at various times post HSV challenge proved most effective within the first 24 h of infection. The above results suggest for the first time that IFN gamma mediates important host defense(s) early during primary HSV infection. Similar results were obtained using antibody to IFN alpha/beta.
