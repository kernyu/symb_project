Biochemical characteristics and antibiotic susceptibilities of five strains of Pseudomonas vesicularis isolated from cervical cultures are reported. The organisms were recovered from Thayer-Martin medium, which, because of its inhibitory properties, restricts over-growth by most other species. Our findings agree with those of Kaltenbach and associates (J. Clin. Microbiol., 1:339--344, 1975) on the importance of esculin hydrolysis, maltose oxidation, and pigmentation in the identification of P. vesicularis. Comparative carbohydrate oxidation studies showed agreement in three of four methods (oxidative attack, buffered single substrate, King oxidative/fermentative medium). No oxidation of carbohydrates was observed in commercial oxidative/fermentative medium. In addition to biochemical characteristics, antibiograms can be useful auxiliary aids in the identification of P. vesicularis and in its differentiation from P. diminuta, a closely related species.
