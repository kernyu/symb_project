Gentamicin C2 interacts cooperatively with ribosomes from a sensitive Escherichia coli strain in a multiphasic way with several classes of sites. It is shown that this binding is highly-dependent on Mg++ and natural endogenous polyamine concentrations. The differences observed between ribosomes from sensitive and resistant strains may be explained by the absence of specific cooperative gentamicin interactions with resistant ribosomes. The effects of other aminoglycoside antibiotics are discussed in terms of structure-activity relationships.
