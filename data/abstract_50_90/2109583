Cefpodoxime proxetil is an oral cephalosporin antibiotic. The in vitro activities of cefpodoxime (the active metabolite of cefpodoxime proxetil), ceftriaxone, and cefuroxime against both antibiotic-susceptible and antibiotic-resistant clinical isolates of Neisseria gonorrhoeae were determined. Cefpodoxime inhibited all penicillin-susceptible strains and penicillinase-producing strains at less than or equal to 0.015 microgram/ml; chromosomally resistant strains were inhibited by cefpodoxime at less than or equal to 0.125 microgram/ml.
