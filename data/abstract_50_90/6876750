A preliminary study in which a sample of 25 patients registered with SLR and TC, Karigiri, with proved secondary DDS-resistant leprosy were compared, with 25 patients not suspected to be DDS-resistant, for social and personality factors, which could have lead to non-compliance in treatment. A structured interview schedule enquiring into factors leading to irregular treatment and the psycho-social background of the patient was used. The Eysank's Personality Inventory (EPI) and Personality traits assessment on a linear analogue was also administered to them. Statistical analysis showed that DDS-resistant leprosy patients were as a group more irregular for treatment, showed personality traits of being casual and uncontrolled and scored high on the neuroticism scale of the EPI.
