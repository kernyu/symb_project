We administered ketoconazole to a young woman with ovarian hyperandrogenism, insulin resistance, and acanthosis nigricans. While taking ketoconazole, her serum testosterone, androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone, and cortisol levels declined, while serum progesterone, 17-hydroxyprogesterone, and 11-deoxycortisol rose. Serum LH, FSH, and estradiol levels were intermittently higher during ketoconazole treatment, although LH and FSH responsiveness to GnRH did not change. Basal and stimulated serum insulin concentrations were high before and during ketoconazole therapy, while fasting glucose levels and glucose disappearance rate constants were normal throughout the study. A dramatic improvement in hirsutism occurred, and menses resumed after a 6-yr hiatus. Adverse drug effects or clinical evidence of adrenal insufficiency were not encountered. These results support a role for ketoconazole in the therapy of ovarian hyperandrogenism.
