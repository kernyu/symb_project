A stable L-form of Bacillus subtilis 168 (sal-1) has been isolated which grows and divides logarithmically in liquid medium with a generation time of 60 min. This mutant does not synthesize cell wall as evidenced by chemical, biochemical, and morphological analyses. Antibiotics which specifically inhibit cell wall biosynthesis do not affect the growth of the L-form. Significant differences exist between the membrane proteins of the bacillary form and the L-form. The relative profile of membrane proteins varies with the salt concentration of the medium in both the L-form and the bacillary form.
