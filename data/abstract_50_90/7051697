The enteral administration of antibiotics has been shown to induce the occult carriership (persistence) of sporulating Gram-positive bacilli inhabiting the intestine before the use of antibiotics and V. eltor introduced orally after the administration of antibiotics is stopped. After the prolonged use of some antibiotics the intestinal tract has been found to become an inadequate environment for the life of nonpathogenic E. coli easily colonizing the intestine of intact germ-free animals. Such form of resistance of colonization is an unfavorable consequence of antibiotic therapy.
