A new taxon had previously been described in the genus Neisseria and it was proposed that "Neisseria polysacchareae" be the provisional epithet for this new "species". In the present work, susceptibility to antibiotics was determined using agar dilution tests. The tested strains of "N. polysacchareae" were isolated from throat, those of N. meningitidis from cases and carriers, and those of other species of Neisseria were from culture collections. The strains of "N. polysacchareae" were less sensitive than those of N. meningitidis, particularly to rifampicin, mecillinam and macrolide antibiotics; they were resistant to colistin and vancomycin and could therefore be isolated on selective medium for pathogenic Neisseria spp.
