Faecal Escherichia coli isolated from healthy farm chickens, from farm chickens with avian influenza, and from chickens with diarrhoea were more resistant to antimicrobial agents (94-100%) than those isolated from healthy domestic chickens (20%). Transfer of drug resistance was readily achieved from strains isolated from both healthy and sick farm chickens, and from diarrhoeic chickens; it was more difficult to demonstrate in strains from domestic chickens. Resistant E. coli showing serotypes suspected to be enteropathogenic for man, i.e 0126:K71(B16), 044:K74 (L) and 0119:K69(B14), were isolated from faecal samples of healthy and sick farm chickens, but not from healthy domestic birds.
