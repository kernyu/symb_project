Three variations of a synthetic growth medium were used to study the folic acid and p-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) requirements of Propionibacterium. P. shermanii, P. freudenreichii, P. thoenii, and P. arabinosum synthesize folic acid and do not require PABA or folic acid. P. pentosaceum, P. jensenii, and P. rubrum are stimulated by folic acid or PABA, but do not show an absolute requirement. P. peterssonii shows a requirement for either PABA or folic acid. The addition of 300 mug of sulfadiazine per ml did not inhibit growth of propionibacteria in the synthetic medium, synthetic medium plus PABA, or synthetic medium plus folic acid. P. freudenreichii was not inhibited even when 500 mug of sulfadiazine per ml was added to the synthetic medium, nor did it degrade sulfadiazine significantly. Trimethoprim totally inhibited the growth of Propionibacterium. Radioactive sulfadiazine was transported by sulfadiazine-sensitive Escherichia coli but not by P. freudenreichii, indicating that the sulfadiazine resistance of propionibacteria could be mainly due to their inability to transport sulfonamides.
