290 Y. enterocolitica strains were tested as regards their sensitivity to 20 chemotherapeutics. All the strains were isolated from fecal specimens taken from human beings in Czechoslovakia. It should be noted that the strains presented homologous group as they belonged to 3 serological group according to Winblad or IA according to Knapp and Thal, they also belonged to biotype 4 according to Nilehn. It has been found that apart from their homogenicity, they showed quite different patterns of sensitivity to chemotherapeutics. Among them quite a great number of the strains were of high level of resistance to antibiotics. It was not possible to transfer their resistance to the sensitive E. coli K12 strain. All the strains proved to produce betalactamase.
