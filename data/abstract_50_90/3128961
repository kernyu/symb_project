The results of the College of American Pathologists (Skokie, III) Microbiology Surveys from 1980 through 1987 indicate subscriber laboratories have continued to improve their ability to identify and test the antimicrobial susceptibility of Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Bacteriology and Comprehensive Surveys participants correctly identified this organism more frequently (95% to 96%) than did the Basic Surveys Laboratories. Neisseria gonorrhoeae samples in mixed cultures were slightly more difficult (3% to 5% decreased accuracy) to identify. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing by the disk-diffusion and beta-lactamase tests were more accurate (98% to 99%) than minimum inhibitory concentration-dilution methods (92%). Currently, most laboratories use the commercially prepared beta-lactamase reagents and the disk-diffusion test. The National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards is currently standardizing methods for the susceptibility testing of several antibiotics against gonococci. The College of American Pathologists Microbiology Surveys will continue to monitor participant accuracy for the identification and resistance recognition of this epidemiologically important pathogen.
