The in vitro activity of apalcillin was compared with that of carbenicillin, ticarcillin, mezlocillin and piperacillin against clinical isolates of Enterobacteriaceae and Acinetobacter. 1 168 strains were tested by a routine disk diffusion method. They were grouped into different patterns of resistance by results to ampicillin, carbenicillin and cephalotin. The MICs were determined for 300 of these strains. Apalcillin, mezlocillin and piperacillin are active against most strains of E. coli, P. mirabilis, Klebsiella and C. diversus resistant to carbenicillin and ticarcillin. Apalcillin is the most active penicillin against Acinetobacter; it is almost as active as piperacillin, the best drug against Enterobacteriaceae.
