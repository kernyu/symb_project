The penetration of netilmicin, a semisynthetic aminoglycosid into the primary human aqueous humor was determined. The antibacterial spectrum of netilmicin is adequate to gentamicin. The efficacy also covers gentamicin resistant strains. After intramuscular injection of 5 mg/kg body weight aqueous levels higher than the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Citrobacter and Proteus morganii were obtained. In the therapy of bacterial endophthalmitis the synergistic effect of netilmicin with beta-Lactam antibiotics in the form of a combined therapy should be made use of. For perioperative prophylaxis the newer aminoglycosids are not indicated because there is the danger of a development of resistant strains.
