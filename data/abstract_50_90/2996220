A collection of TK+, ACV-resistant mutants of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) has been derived using a selection system based on biochemically transformed cells. Evidence is presented suggesting that most of these mutants induce resistant DNA polymerase activities and are thus likely to express variant DNA polymerases. Preliminary data on the pathogenesis of these mutants show that most are similar to wild type virus in the majority of their characteristics, although they may be reduced in their ability to kill mice.
