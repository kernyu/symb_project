We determined whether drug-resistant variants of HIV-1 could be isolated from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of 20 individuals with HIV infection (Centers for Disease Control groups II and III) on long-term zidovudine (AZT) therapy. Toward this end, zidovudine (10 microM) has been included in the tissue culture medium used to isolate HIV-1. Under these circumstances, virus with a zidovudine-resistant phenotype was successfully obtained in five out of 20 cases. This property of drug resistance appeared to be stable, and did not disappear upon extended replication of such virus in the absence of drug pressure. Drug-resistant virus could also be isolated from these subjects on subsequent occasions, but was not present in samples obtained prior to therapy. Replication of these zidovudine-resistant isolates in tissue culture was inhibited by each of four other nucleoside analogues. Thus, other drugs may be useful in controlling selective zidovudine-resistant variants of HIV-1.
