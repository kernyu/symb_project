The article comprises the data on the elimination of streptomycin resistance in Staphylococcus aureus after its passage for a long time in a low permanent magenetic field (PMF) with H = 0.5 oe and in a space screened from the geomagnetic field in a permaloy chamber (H = 10(-2). Under these conditions the eliminating effect of the geomagnetic field intensity on the streptomycin resistance of Staphylococci became perceptible after 5--10 their passage under unusual conditions. At the next stages of investigation the eliminating effect of low PMF and of screening was enhanced. At the end of the experiment after 25--40 passages of Staphylococcus aureus throung MF of different intensity the elimination of streptomycin resistance was recorded in all the 11 cultures studied. The quantity of eliminates in populations of experimental substrains of Staphylococcus increased by 1.5--10 and more times as compared to the control.
