Unequal crossing-over is involved in genetic duplication and deletion in such diverse genetic systems as Drosophila, bacteria, and animal viruses. It is proposed to be involved in the form of unequal sister chromatid exchange in gene amplification in cultured animal cells and during carcinogenesis. Studies of the process of unequal crossing-over have been hampered by the lack of genetic systems allowing specific selection for cells that have undergone such unequal crossing-over. We report here on the construction of plasmids designed to provide specific selection of unequal crossing-over. One such plasmid was studied in Escherichia coli. We show that kanamycin resistance is generated, as predicted, by the expected unequal crossover event.
