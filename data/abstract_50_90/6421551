Subinhibitory concentrations of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) increased the susceptibility of Escherichia coli K12 multiple aminoglycoside antibiotics and nitrofurantoin-resistant mutants to aminoglycoside antibiotics (20- to 25-fold) and nitrofurantoin (15-fold). The same concentration of EDTA also increased the susceptibility of high-level nitrofurantoin-resistant mutants to nitrofurantoin. Aminoglycoside-resistant mutants with increased susceptibility to nitrofurantoin (2- to 3-fold) were selected with neomycin from E. coli nitrofurantoin-sensitive and resistant mutants. Decreased permeability of nitrofurantoin is inferred as one of the mechanisms of nitrofurantoin resistance.
