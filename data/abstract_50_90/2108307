The isoenzyme pattern of the Trypanosoma cruzi Y strain recovered from mice inoculated with 15 x 10(4) blood trypomastigotes and previously treated with either Bay 2502 (Nifurtimox) or Ro 7-1051 (Benzonidazol) was analyzed in the following situations: a) strain resistant to Bay 2502 and again treated with the same drug; b) strain resistant to Bay 2502 and treated with Ro 7-1051; c) strain resistant to Ro 7-1051 and treated with that same drug. Although marked drug resistance was noted in all cases, the isoenzyme pattern of the Y strain for GPI, PGM, ALAT and ASAT remained throughout the same. The pattern was similar to that of the Peruvian strain, which also belongs to the same strain Type of the Y strain, but differed from those of the 21 SF (Type II) and Colombian (Type III) strains. Thus, the appearance of drug resistance in T. cruzi strain was not associated with a change in its isoenzymatic pattern.
