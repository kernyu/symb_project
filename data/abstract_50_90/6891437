We studied the effect of cycloheximide (CH) on the induction of mutation and sister-chromatid exchanges (SCEs) in ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS)-treated Chinese hamster cells. At 10(-6)M, CH strongly antagonized the induction of mutation and SCEs and cell survival increased. This suggests that protein synthesis is essential for the induction of mutation as well as SCEs. Results of experiments in which CH treatment preceded or followed exposure to mutagens were similar with respect to the response curves obtained for mutation and SCEs.
