The study of the enterotoxigenicity of S. typhimurium with the use of the skin test on rabbits (to detect the delayed permeability factor) has revealed that these strains produce an enterotoxin similar to Escherichia coli thermolabile enterotoxin (TLE). Study of the enterotoxic activity of lysates obtained from 39 S. typhimurium strains and 5 S. dublin strains by sonication has revealed that 87% of S. typhimurium strains and all S. dublin strains produce an enterotoxin similar to E. coli TLE, as demonstrated by all tests used in this investigation, while 59% of S. typhimurium cultures and all S. dublin strains have been positive when tested for the capacity of producing the rapid permeability factor. "Hospital" strains and polyresistant cultures isolated from the environment (phagovar 20) are characterized by a higher rate of producing an enterotoxin similar to E. coli TLE, detected by the tests used in this investigation (90%), than antibiotic-sensitive strains of different origin (78%).
