A study of 357 cases of tuberculosis in African negro immigrants seen between 1967 and 1971 showed the predominance of respiratory lesions especially pulmonary and/or hilar ganglio-mediastinal lesions compared with lesions elsewhere, e.g. lymph nodes, bones, joints, pericardium, peritoneum, livers, and the frequency of multiple lesions. Routine detection should be more frequent in high risk subjects, who are almost always allergic on arrival in France. In spite of frequent resistance, above all primary, treatment gave good results in 83% of cases. In future, we will have to take into consideration the possibility of relapses and perhaps more numerous resistances, including to rifamycin and ethambutol.
