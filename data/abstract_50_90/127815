The efficacy of orally administered trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was compared with that of oral amoxicillin in therapy of typhoid fever due to both epidemic chloramphenicol-resistant and endemic chloramphenicol-sensitive Salmonella typhi. Both drug regimens were effective and of comparable value in treatment of chloramphenicol-resistant infections, as measured by duration of fever (124 hr and 115 hr, respectively) and duration of bacteremia (1.0 and 0.4 days, respectively). Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole therapy of infections due to chloramphenicol-sensitive S. typhi resulted in more rapid lysis of fever than did amoxicillin therapy. Trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole were not synergistic in vitro against the chloramphenicol-resistant strain of S. typhi, and the role of sulfamethoxazole in treatment of such infections appears to be minimal. Oral administration of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is effective therapy of chloramphenicol-resistant, and probably of ampicillin-amoxicillin-resistant, typhoid fever.
