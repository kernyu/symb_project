The concentration of EDTA-Tris (3.22 mM EDTA and 0.05 M Tris) used as a lavage to treat otitis externa, cystitis or other persistent infections in dogs and cats, was found to prevent the growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and beta streptococci when present in growth media. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was rapidly lysed in this solution. Escherichia coli and Proteus vulgaris grew in the presence of EDTA-Tris, but to a lesser extent than the controls without these compounds. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) for 8 antimicrobial agents with and without EDTA-Tris were determined for E. coli and P. vulgaris. A potentiation effect on E. coli (greater than 50% decrease MIC) was observed when EDTA-Tris was combined with penicillin, oxytetracycline or chloramphenicol. A similar effect was observed with P. vulgaris when combinations of EDTA-Tris plus gentamicin, oxytetracycline, polymyxin-B or triple sulfa were used. The results of this study indicate that EDTA-Tris appears to have merit in selected cases of otitis externa, cystitis or other persistent infections where lavage might be used.
