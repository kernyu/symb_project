Corneal infection due to the species Aspergillus flavus is rare and often destructive. This report describes a case of Aspergillus flavus corneal ulcer that failed to respond to amphotericin B, pimaricin, and clotrimazole. The eye subsequently became phthisical. The rational approach to the management of fungal corneal infection is to culture or perform sensitivity tests on the isolated organism. Early surgical intervention should be done if the infection fails to respond to medical treatment, and if the disease process extends deep into the stromal tissue and anterior chamber. Fungal malignant glaucoma requires excisional keratoplasty, lens extraction, and anterior vitrectomy.
