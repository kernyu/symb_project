Resistance to aminoglycoside antibiotics in Micromonospora purpurea (the producer of gentamicin C complex), Streptomyces tenebrarius (the nebramycin producer) and Streptomyces tenjimariensis (which makes istamycin) occurs at the level of the ribosome. Reconstitution analysis has revealed, in each case, that 16S rRNA plays a critical role in determining such resistance.
