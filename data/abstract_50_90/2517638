Sensitivity of cephaperasone (CEFOBID) of 966 straits of microorganisms, isolated from 661 patients was assessed. The study was carried out according to the trial described by Bauer et al, using the Mueller-Hinton medium and original cephaperasone tests (Pfizer). Full sensitivity was found in 87.1% of the organisms. The following conclusions were made: 1. Most isolated organisms were sensitivite to cephaperasone (87.1%); E. coli (98.5%), Kl. Pneumoniae (94.8%), Atrobacter (93.1%), Enterobacter (92.8%), Klebsiella sp (92.5%). Lowered sensitivity was seen in Pseudomonas sp. (70.9%), Acinobacter (70.8%) and Alcaligenes (58.3%). 2. Cross-resistance with other cephalosporines was found in 27.8% of the cases. In 52.4% full sensitivity to cephaperasone was found, and resistance to other clinically used cephalosporines.
