A recombinant plasmid was constructed (pV69) which comprises a subgenomic fragment of bovine papilloma virus type 1 (BPV1) DNA, part of plasmid pBR322 DNA and a drug resistance gene expressed in both mammalian fibroblasts and Escherichia coli. This gene (vv2) is a modified form of the bacterial neomycin resistance gene (neo) linked to the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (tk) promoter (plasmid pAG60), to which the original bacterial neo promoter from transposon Tn5 was added back, upstream of the eukaryotic promoter. It induced kanamycin resistance in E. coli, as well as resistance to the drug G418 in rat and mouse fibroblasts. Its expression in FR3T3 rat cells was enhanced as compared with the original tk-neo construction. After transfer of plasmid pV69 into C127 mouse cells or FR3T3 rat cells, the number of resistant colonies selected in medium containing G418 was one to two orders of magnitude higher than that of transformed foci in normal medium. In eight independent cell lines selected by drug resistance, pV69 DNA was found to be maintained in a plasmidial state, without any detectable rearrangement or deletion and could be transferred back in E. coli. In contrast, cell lines selected by focus formation in normal medium maintained deleted forms of the original plasmid DNA, and only part of them were resistant to G418. Most of the drug-resistant clones had kept the morphology and growth control of the normal fibroblasts. However, with further passages in culture, these cells spontaneously produced transformed foci with increasing frequencies.
