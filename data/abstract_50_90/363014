The susceptibility to antimicrobial agents of 321 strains of Aeromonas hydrophila was studied: 319 strains were found to be resistant to one or several antibiotics. Transfer of resistance markers was obtained from 24 strains. Five plasmids from these strains were classified into incompatibility group incC. Epidemiological consequences of R plasmid diffusion in water bacteria are discussed.
