Rhizobium japonicum, capable of binding high-molecular-weight donor (32)P-labeled deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) during late log phase in a competence medium, was transformed for streptomycin resistance with a frequency of transformation ranging between 0.02 and 0.08%. Eight to 10% of the homologous native (32)P-labeled input DNA was bound irreversibly in a temperature-dependent manner. Homologous denatured (32)P-labeled DNA was incapable of binding to the recipient under similar conditions. CsCl density gradient banding of the donor and recipient DNA indicated homology. The low frequency of transformation could be due to one or more steps that occur between DNA uptake and integration.
