Trimethoprim Sulfa is a valuable agent in the prophylaxis of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia in immunocompromised children. Like several other antimicrobial substances also TMPS has an impact on the normal bacterial flora of children. TMPS sensitive enterobacteria are eliminated from the gut flora within 48 hours. The impact on the total number of aerobic organisms and the composition of the fecal flora however is just moderate. Major changes in gut flora result from previous administration of antibiotic and chemotherapeutic agents or from environmental changes (e. g. discharge into ambulatory care). The gut flora of patients under such chemoprophylaxis is a major source of TMPS resistant aerobic bacteria in the hospital and requires careful disposal of these wastes.
