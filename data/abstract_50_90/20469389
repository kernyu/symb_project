Antimicrobial drugs are used extensively, but not well. Widespread and indiscriminate use of these drugs encourages the development of antibiotic resistance. Before prescribing an antimicrobial drug, physicians should ask themselves whether prophylactic or empirical therapy is justified, what is (are) the most likely micro-organism(s) involved, what is the best antimicrobial drug for this patient, and what is the optimal dosage and duration of treatment. The penicillins, erythromycin, tetracycline, cephalosporins, sulfonamides, cotrimoxazole and trimethoprim are discussed in the light of these questions.
