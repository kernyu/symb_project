The time-course of changes in the antidiuretic activity of plasma in response to burn injury has been assayed in intact rabbits and in those with an altered body reactivity induced by a preliminary injury to the anterior and posterior hypothalamus. It was demonstrated that in control animals and in rabbits with an injury to the anterior hypothalamus, the burn led to a phasic activation of the hypothalamo-neurohypophyseal system. In animals with an injury to the posterior hypothalamus, the burn, in contrast, inhibited the activation of the system, while the phasic pattern of the responses remained unchanged. The experiments on rats have shown that the decreased activity of the hypothalamo-neurohypophyseal system induced by the pharmacological blockade of the supraoptic nuclei of the hypothalamus raised the body resistance in burn injury.
