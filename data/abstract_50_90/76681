A phosphonoacetate (PA)-resistant mutant of the herpesvirus of turkeys (HVT) was isolated and characterized. The mutant of HVT resistant to PA (HVTpa) replicated in duck embryo fibroblast (DEF) culture in media containing 300 microgram PA/ml, whereas the replication of the wild type of HVT (HVTwt) was completely inhibited in DEF culture in media containing 100 microgram PA/ml. The HVTpa was distinct from the HVTwt in plaque morphology, but was indistinguishable antigenically and showed in vitro temperature sensitivity at 41 degrees C (3741 degrees C efficiency of replication was about 5). It replicated poorly in chickens and failed to provide complete protection against challenge with Marek's disease virus (MDV). The HVTpa-induced DNA polymerase had an apparent inhibition constant for PA, an apparent inhibition constant for pyrophosphate, and an apparent Michaells constant for dCTP about 10, 2, and 2.5 times, respectively, greater than the constants for the HVTwt-induced enzyme and was also more thermolabile.
