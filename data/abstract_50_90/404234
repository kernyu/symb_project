Many infections of the urinary tract, especially after surgical treatment are nosocomial infections. The etiological bacteria could only be found in the urine of the infected patients and in the faecal flora of nearly 40% of all stationary patients. The so called "problem bacteria": Klebsiella, Proteus rettgeri, pseudomonas showed increasing drug resistance during the observed period between 1972-1975. The bacteria isolated from the faecal flora also showed multiple drug resistance. Thus we concluded that the antibiotic regime in these patients is very important for the selection and the increase of the problem bacteria both in urine and in the faecal flora.
