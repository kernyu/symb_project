The activity of propolis and its combinations with antibiotics against antibiotic resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus was studied. It was found that staphylococcae strains resistant to benzylpenicillin, tetracycline and erythromycin were mainly sensitive to propolis. It is concluded that there was synergism in the effect of propolis and antibiotics with respect to antibiotic resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus.
