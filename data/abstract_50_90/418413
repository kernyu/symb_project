A plasmid pC194, encoding resistance to chloramphenicol, can serve as a cloning vector in Bacillus subtilis 168 for other HindIII-cleaved DNA segments. Replicons constructed by linking pC194 to several Escherichia coli plasmids can be used to introduce and compare the expression of the same genes in these two bacterial hosts.
