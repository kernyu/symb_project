The aim of the study was to determine the therapeutical effectiveness of a new regimen in freshly diagnosed cases of pulmonary tuberculosis. In this model PZA and SM were excluded, but INH administration was prolonged. Instead of INH and RMP a combined drug was given--RIFAMAZIDE (Polfa). Therapy was carried out in three stages: I stage lasting 3 months during which Rifamazide (600 mg RMP, 300 mg INH) and EMB (25 mg per kg b.w.) was given; II stage-during which Rifamazide was given (2 tablets.) for 3 months; III stage--INH monotherapy (300 mg daily) was continued for 6 months. During the first stage all patients were hospitalized at the Institute of Tuberculosis. The second stage was carried out under supervision of an out-patient clinic. During the third stage patients received their INH at their homes. The study group consisted initially of 58 patients, of which 11 were dropped out due to primary resistance, change of therapy, non-compliance, and non-tolerance of drugs. The final evaluation was carried out basing on results from 47 patients. In all patients a negative sputum culture was achieved. In most during the first two months of therapy. All demonstrated improvement in radiological evaluation. In 38 patients the follow-up lasted 2-6 years, in the remaining nine 2 years. Recurrencies were not observed. Good acceptation by the patients of Rifamazide was found.
