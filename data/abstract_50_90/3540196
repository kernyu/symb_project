The transport and hydrolysis of several radioactive di- and tripeptides in Saccharomyces cerevisiae was studied. A peptide-transport-deficient mutant isolated on the basis of its resistance to nikkomycin Z lost most of its capacity to take up di- and tripeptides. The transport kinetics of [14C]methionylglycine, [14C]methionylsarcosine and [3H]nikkomycin Z indicated that peptide transport is not dependent on intracellular hydrolysis. Intact cells had some peptidase activity towards methionylsarcosine but not towards nikkomycin Z. The relationship between this activity and peptide transport is discussed.
