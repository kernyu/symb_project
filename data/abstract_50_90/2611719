Previous studies showed two deviations from the predictions of the undistributed parallel tube model for hepatic uptake of substrates: a small deviation at high flows and a large deviation at low flows. We have examined whether these deviations could be described by a single correction factor. In cats anesthetized with pentobarbital, a hepatic venous long-circuit technique with an extracorporeal reservoir was used to vary portal flow and hepatic venous pressure, and allow repeated sampling of arterial, portal, and hepatic venous blood without depletion of the cat's blood volume. Hepatic uptake of ethanol was measured over a wide range of blood flows and when intrahepatic pressure was increased at low flows. This uptake could be described by the parallel tube model with a correction for hepatic blood flow: Uptake = Vmax max.(1 - e-kF).c/(Km + c). In 22 cats, Vmax max = 90 +/- 5 mumols/(min.100 g liver), k = 0.021 +/- 0.0015 when flow (F) was in millilitres per minute per 100 g liver, and Km = 150 +/- 20 microM when c is the log mean sinusoidal concentration. (1 - e-kF) represents the proportion of sinusoids perfused and metabolically active. A dynamic interpretation of this proportion is related to intermittency (derecruitment) of sinusoidal flow. Half the sinusoids were perfused at a flow of 33 mL/(min.100 g liver) and the liver was essentially completely perfused (greater than 95%) at the normal flow of 150 mL/(min.100 g liver). Derecruitment was not changed by raising hepatic venous pressure, and it was not related to hepatic venous resistance.
