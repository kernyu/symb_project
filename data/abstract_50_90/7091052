One hundred and fifty-six urine specimens with a pure culture of coagulase-negative Staphylococcus were studied. One hundred and eighteen charts were reviewed for clinical evidence of urinary tract infections. Twenty-four cases of urinary tract infection were found. The younger females in the study tended to have infection due to novobiocin resistant Staphylococcus in contrast to males and older females.
