Five quinolone antimicrobic agents were tested to determine the mean inhibitory concentration (MIC) of each of 17 clinical strains of Bordetella pertussis by the agar dilution method. Ciprofloxacin demonstrated the best in vitro activity with an MIC90 of 0.06 microgram/ml. Norfloxacin, ofloxacin and enoxacin were also highly active with MIC90s of 0.25, 0.25, and 0.5, respectively. Cinoxacin was only moderately active (MIC90 4.0 microgram/ml).
