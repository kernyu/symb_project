Basic surgical research has demonstrated that bacterial infection is a function of the dose of bacteria times virulence over resistance of the host. This risk of infection can be lowered by the use of preoperative antibiotics. Preoperative use of antibiotics has few if any complications. However, one can not use preoperative antibiotics as a replacement for good surgical technique and sound surgical principles.
