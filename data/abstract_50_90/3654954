In a patient with campylobacteriosis, we observed development of resistance to nalidixic acid and norfloxacin under adequate treatment with the latter antibiotic. Isolates before and after treatment differed in their total protein profile but were otherwise identical with respect to enzymatic activity, serotype, crude membrane protein profiles, and other phenotypic characteristics.
