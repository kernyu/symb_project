Specific transformation of a rifampicin sensitive strain of Escherichia coli to rifampicin resistance has been performed by a single, defined DNA restriction fragment carrying the genetic information for the beta subunit of E. coli RNA polymerase. In this transformation the transforming genetic character has been substituted for the corresponding recipient gene locus by recombination. The value of the described transformation system for locating genetic markers on DNA restriction fragments is discussed in comparison to previously reported in vitro systems.
