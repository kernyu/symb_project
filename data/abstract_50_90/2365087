To elucidate the mode of action of norakin against influenza A virus we sequenced the hemagglutinin gene of 11 norakin-resistant mutants. Resistance was coupled with 1-3 amino acid exchanges. The majority of mutations was localized in the HA2 polypeptide and was mostly associated with changes in charge or polarity of the amino acids. The amino acid substitutions are discussed in the context of the 3D structure of X31 hemagglutinin considered to be representative of the influenza hemagglutinins. Most of the mutations appear to destabilize the pH 7.0 structure by distorting or destroying hydrogen bonds as well as salt-bridges which are responsible for intra- and intersubunit contacts, while others destabilize the location of the fusion peptide, facilitating conformational changes in the presence of the inhibitor.
