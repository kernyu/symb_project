The recombination-dependent loss of a duplicated portion of the Escherichia coli chromosome is five- to tenfold greater in strains containing streptomycin resistance (strA) mutations than in the strA+ parental strain. Streptomycin (500 mug/ml) partially reverses the increase. These results suggest an interaction between strA mutations and recombination.
