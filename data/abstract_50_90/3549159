The present review is concerned with recent progress in basic genetic investigations with a variety of fungi which are pathogenic for man and animals. The principles and strategies involved in undertaking genetic investigations of sexual species and of asexual species are discussed. Progress in genetic analysis of Cryptococcus neoformans made possible by the discovery of its sexual phase is described in detail, as is progress in development of parasexual methods of analysis in Candida albicans. The genetic bases of virulence and drug resistance are discussed for those few species in which these phenotypes have been investigated. Suggestions for future research, including the application of recent advances in molecular biology to the study of pathogenic fungi, are presented.
