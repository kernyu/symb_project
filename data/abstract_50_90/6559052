Viridans streptococci are thought to be highly susceptible to penicillin and streptomycin. We recently encountered a unique group of 15 isolates from South Africa epidemiologically related to the isolation of penicillin-resistant pneumococci. These organisms were highly resistant to penicillin (PCN) (minimal inhibitory concentration, 1 to 32 micrograms/ml) and streptomycin (SM) (minimal inhibitory concentration, greater than or equal to 2,000 micrograms/ml). Two additional organisms with high-level streptomycin resistance were identified when 168 clinical isolates from Boston were screened. Time-kill studies with four organisms resistant to high levels of SM demonstrated lack of synergy between PCN and SM but marked synergy between PCN and gentamicin. Adenylylating, acetylating, and phosphorylating activity could not be detected in three organisms studied, and novobiocin failed to cure the SM resistance. Protein synthesis by ribosomes isolated from these organisms was dramatically reduced in the presence of gentamicin but was relatively resistant to inhibition by SM.
