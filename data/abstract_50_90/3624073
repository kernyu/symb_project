Chloropolysporins A, B and C, as well as derivatives prepared from this group and alpha- and beta-avoparcins by enzymatic and mild acid hydrolysis, were active against Gram-positive bacteria including clinically isolated methicillin-resistant Staphylococci (MIC 0.39-6.25 micrograms/ml) and anaerobic enterobacteria (MIC 0.10-1.56 micrograms/ml). Derhamnosyl and demannosyl derivatives from both groups of antibiotics showed stronger activities than the parent compounds. The MIC and MBC values against Staphylococci were similar and were not effected by the presence of serum. Moreover, chloropolysporin C exhibited very strong synergistic effects with various beta-lactam antibiotics against methicillin-resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus. Some of these compounds also protected mice from experimental infection with S. aureus. Acute toxicities of chloropolysporin by intravenous administration ranged from 215-290 mg/kg in mice. Chloropolysporin B as well as other glycopeptide antibiotics, showed distinctive growth promoting activity in broiler chickens.
