While repository adjuvants are already established drugs for antigen specific immunomodulation, no unspecific active immunomodulator has successfully passed clinical trials in tumor patients in Western countries yet. As this is in striking contrast to the effects seen with unspecific immunomodulators in experimental immunological and tumor test systems, the value of those screening models to predict clinical success may be asked for. To improve the success rate, it is recommended to test compounds for their immunomodulatory effects as broad as possible in ex vivo and in vivo test systems. Subsequently, the prophylactic as well as therapeutic potency of selected immunomodulating drugs should be evaluated in various models of aptitude, such as chronic infection, autoimmune diseases and chronic inflammatory reactions. Those diseases are at least to a certain extent influenced by the immune system, in contrast to the uncertainty in case of tumor diseases. In a battery of chronic infection models we could find that different chemoimmunotherapeutics with very similar immunopharmacological activity behaved quite different. Most compounds were ineffective, a part enhanced chronic diseases and only in a few cases a therapeutic effect could be shown. On the other hand, effectivity in protection against the pathogenicity of subsequently applied, selected microorganisms does not predict the therapeutic potency for the same pathogen. Altogether the data show that activation of cells of the immune system by an immunostimulating drug does not predict its therapeutic potency. Moreover, activation of immune cells may also impair the immune resistance.
