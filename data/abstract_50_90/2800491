Indices of unspecific resistance (bactericidal serum activity, phagocytic reaction of neutrophils, lysozyme) were examined in 128 patients with ulcer disease and chronic gastritis. Changes of local and general mechanisms of unspecific reactivity of the gastro-intestinal tract result not only in disorders of the defence system but also in a reduction of viability of the gastric and duodenal epithelium with development of alteration processes. In this condition bacterial and protein antigens may change the immunological status of the body.
