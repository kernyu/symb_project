Investigations in vitro were carried out to overcome the drug resistance of transconjugants of Escherichia coli with resistance to neomycin, kanamycin, chloramphenicol, and tetracycline. Use was made of zinkbacitracin Pharmachim . It was found that in conc. of 32 gammas /cm3 zinkbacitracin the elimination of resistance, on an average, to neomycin is 34.9%, to kanamycin - 27.1%, to chloramphenicol - 42.4%, and to tetracycline - 24.9%. With the transconjugants treated with a higher concentration of 64 gammas /cm3 the figures were 42.8%, 34.5%, 46.2%, and 32.4%, respectively. The conclusion is made that zinkbacitracin Pharmachim is effective in eliminating the resistance of E. coli to the antibiotics in the experiment. The higher the concentration used the higher the percent of resistance climination .
