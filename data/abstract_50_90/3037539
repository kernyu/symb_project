A retroviral host-range neomycin-resistant myeloproliferative sarcoma virus mutant, which is expressed in the embryonal carcinoma cell lines F9 and PCC4aza1R, was molecularly cloned and analyzed. This mutant virus, PCMV, differs from myeloproliferative sarcoma virus by two major deletions, one of which spans exactly a 75-base-pair repeat of the long terminal repeat. Functional analysis of recombinant viruses shows that the host-range expansion of PCMV is a property of nucleotide changes within the U3 region of the long terminal repeat. Furthermore, expression assays of chimeric long terminal repeats show that the enhancer region of PCMV joined to the promoter region of Moloney murine leukemia virus is sufficient to direct the synthesis of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase in F9 and PCC4 cells.
