Extending previous results obtained for three strains of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, four naturally occurring, multiply resistant isolates were used in transformation studies. Six drug resistance loci corresponding to those found in the previously studied strains were identified. In addition, the mtr and ery-2 loci were found to be allelic.
