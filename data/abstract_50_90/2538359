The efficacy of sodium stibogluconate against Leishmania donovani infections was markedly enhanced by encapsulating this drug in tuftsin-bearing liposomes. Also, pretreatment of the animals with these liposomes (free of drug) rendered them resistant to this infection, possibly by activating the host's macrophages. These results demonstrate that tuftsin-bearing liposomes besides delivering the drug to the target cells could also enhance the nonspecific resistance against infections, thus offering an additional advantage over the use of tuftsin-free liposomes as drug carriers in leishmania therapy.
