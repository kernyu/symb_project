The authors report a case of Plasmodium falciparum malaria acquired in Kenya by a French tourist under correct chloroquine prophylaxis. She recovered under quinine and a sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine association. This is a new case of high level resistance (R II or R III) of Plasmodium falciparum to amino-4-quinolines recognized in East Africa. Malarial chemoprophylaxis recommended until now for this area may need to be reviewed.
