The in vitro activity of drugs, namely dehydroemetine, ornidazole, metronidazole and tinidazole were determined against the locally isolated strains of E. histolytica in Thailand. The test was performed in liquid monophasic medium, i.e. liver marmite serum medium. In all, locally isolated strains from thirty hosts studied, the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) for dehydroemetine ranged from 0.125 to 1 microgram/ml, ornidazole ranged from 0.0625 to 0.25 microgram/ml, metronidazole ranged from 0.0625 to 0.125 microgram/ml, and tinidazole ranged from 0.0625 microgram/ml to 0.25 microgram/ml. The MIC of dehydroemetine was significantly different from ornidazole, metronidazole and tinidazole. Metronidazole was superior to that of dehydroemetine but was not significantly different among ornidazole, metronidazole and tinidazole.
