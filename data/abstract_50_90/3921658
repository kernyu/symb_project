H2 production by the human protozoan parasite Trichomonas vaginalis was monitored continuously under a mobile gas phase using a membrane-inlet mass spectrometer. Simultaneous and continuous measurement of dissolved H2, O2 and CO2 indicated that H2 evolution was inhibited at levels of O2 (less than 0.25 microM) undetectable by the technique, whereas CO2 production was stimulated. Respiration was not stimulated by admitting H2 to the gas phase. Metronidazole inhibited both H2 and CO2 production. Values of K1 for inhibition of H2 formation in strain ATCC 30001 (metronidazole sensitive) of 0.16 mM and in strain 85 (metronidazole resistant) of 1.0 mM were obtained. These data suggest that metronidazole not only competes with protons as electron acceptor but that the drug itself or a product of reduction actively inhibits some hydrogenosomal enzyme or electron carrier involved in H2 production. Under these conditions metronidazole inhibition leads to irreversible loss of cell motility.
