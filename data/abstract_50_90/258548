Bacterial isolates from expressed prostatic secretions were tested in vitro for susceptibility to five antimicrobial agents used in the treatment of prostatitis. Comparisons of susceptibility and resistance were made between minocycline and each of the other four agents: tetracycline, cephalexin, ampicillin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. A high percentage of the isolates from patients with prostatitis which were resistant to tetracycline and trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole were susceptible to minocycline.
