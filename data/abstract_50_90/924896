Cefazaflur has a broad-spectrum of in vitro antibacterial activity equal to or greater than that of the commercially-available cephalosporins. In addition, cefazaflur has activity against isolates of Enterobacter, Citrobacter and indole-positive Proteus; however, this activity decreased markedly when the MIC determinations were carried out with a large inoculum size. A similar inoculum effect was observed with cefamandole, however, cefoxitin's activity was relatively unchanged at increased inoculum sizes. Human serum had a relatively small effect on the in vitro activity of cefazaflur.
