Oliguric acute renal failure in man is characterized by intense outer cortical vasoconstriction and a marked increase in preglomerular resistance. The degree of preglomerlar resistance change needed to cause the expected 50 to 80 percent fall in blood flow far exceeds the level that would totally abolish filtration. By contrast, equal 3.0-fold increases in both pre- and postglomerular resistance provide this same degree of ischemia but leave filtration very well maintained. Such a scenario seems unlikely, however, since it would entail a mere 15 to 25 percent decrease in preglomerular resistance vessel caliber rather than the extreme attenuation observed. By contrast, there are reasons to believe that preglomerular constriction may be accompanied by postglomerular vascular relaxation. In sum, unless cortical ischemia reflects precisely matched increases in pre- and postglomerular resistances, filtration failure is inevitable in human vasomotor nephropathy.
