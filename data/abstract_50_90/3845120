The nasal carrier-rate of Staphylococcus aureus in 548 Nigerians aged 9-32 years and attending various educational establishments was 56.4%. This rate decreased with increasing age. A significantly greater proportion of females (65.0%) than males (46.5%) were carriers, but the excess in females was apparent only in subjects aged greater than 20 years. Mucoid strains of S. aureus, which gave a negative slide-coagulase reaction, were found in 21.5% of carriers aged 10-15 years, but were absent from members of other age-groups. A considerable proportion of all the strains tested were resistant to commonly used antibiotics.
