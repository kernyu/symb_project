Quantitative analysis of extracellular protease, NADH-oxydase and glucose-deshydrogenase show that, from two mutants selected by their oxytetracycline resistance, one sporulates better than the parent strain, the other, which sporulates at 10(-5), has a stable extracellular protease activity and appears to be blocked at stage O-I.
