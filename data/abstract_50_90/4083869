The in vitro susceptibility of 30 Corynebacterium group D2 strains to nine antimicrobial agents was determined. Vancomycin and norfloxacin were the most active agents tested. All strains were resistant to ampicillin and cephalothin, all except one were resistant to gentamicin, and the activity of erythromycin, novobiocin, tetracycline, and rifampin varied.
