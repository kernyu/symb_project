Combination effects of fosfomycin (FOM) and other oral antimicrobial agents were studied against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (methicillin: minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) greater than or equal to 12.5 micrograms/ml) isolated from skin and skin structure infections. The fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC) index equal to or less than 0.5 was seen in 63.0% of 27 MRSA strains for FOM and minocycline combination, in 44.4% for FOM and cefatrizine, in 44.4% for FOM and cefaclor, in 40.7% for FOM and cefalexin, in 37.0% for FOM and doxycycline, in 29.6% for FOM and erythromycin, in 22.2% for FOM and rokitamycin, in 18.5% for FOM and ofloxacin, in 14.8% for FOM and sultamicillin, in 11.1% for FOM and clavulanic acid/amoxicillin. The combination effects of FOM and minocyclin, or FOM and cephalosporins were higher than other combinations with FOM. Combination of FOM with other antibiotics could be a useful way to treat MRSA skin and skin structure infections.
