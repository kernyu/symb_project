The enzyme 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EC 2.5.1.19), encoded by the aroA locus, is a target site of glyphosate inhibition in bacteria. A glyphosate-resistant aroA allele has been cloned in Escherichia coli from a mutagenized strain of Salmonella typhimurium. Subcloning of this mutant aroA allele shows the gene to reside on a 1.3-kilobase segment of S. typhimurium DNA. Nucleotide sequence analysis of this mutant gene indicates a protein-coding region 427 amino acids in length. Comparison of the mutant and wild type aroA gene sequences reveals a single base pair change resulting in a Pro to Ser amino acid substitution at the 101st codon of the protein. A hybrid gene fusion between mutant and wild type aroA gene sequences was constructed. 5-Enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase was prepared from E. coli cells harboring this construct. The glyphosate-resistant phenotype is shown to be associated with the single amino acid substitution described above.
