The additional penicillin-binding protein (PBP) 2' that is important in determining intrinsic resistance in methicillin-resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has been purified by affinity chromatography using monoclonal antibodies. Monoclonal antibody 1/423.10.351 reacted in ELISA with detergent extracts of membranes from resistant organisms, but not in immunoblots with PBP 2' separated by SDS-PAGE. Immunoprecipitation experiments showed that antibody 1/423.10.351 reacted with PBP 2' in detergent extracts. The latter antibody, covalently coupled to protein A-Sepharose through the Fc region, served as an affinity matrix to purify PBP 2'. The PBP was detected in immunoblots using a second monoclonal antibody, 2/401.43. Conjugation of this antibody with alkaline phosphatase afforded more rapid detection of PBP 2' for the immunological detection of PBP 2' both in affinity-purified fractions and in resistant strains.
