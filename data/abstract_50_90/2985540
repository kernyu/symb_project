We constructed a shuttle vector, pE5-2, which can replicate in both Bacteroides spp. and Escherichia coli. pE5-2 contains a cryptic Bacteroides plasmid (pB8-51), a 3.8-kilobase (kb) EcoRI-D fragment from the 41-kb Bacteroides fragilis plasmid pBF4, and RSF1010, an IncQ E. coli plasmid. pE5-2 was mobilized by R751, an IncP E. coli plasmid, between E. coli strains with a frequency of 5 X 10(-2) to 3.8 X 10(-1) transconjugants per recipient. R751 also mobilized pE5-2 from E. coli donors to Bacteroides uniformis 0061RT and Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron 5482 with a frequency of 0.9 X 10(-6) to 2.5 X 10(-6). The Bacteroides transconjugants contained only pE5-2 and were resistant to clindamycin and erythromycin. Thus, the gene for clindamycin and erythromycin resistance must be located within the Eco RI-D fragment of BF4. A second recombinant plasmid, pSS-2, which contained 33 kb of pBF4 (including the EcoRI-D fragment and contiguous regions) could also be mobilized by R751 between E. coli strains. In some transconjugants, a 5.5-kb (+/- 0.3 kb) segment of the pBF4 portion of pSS2 was inserted into one of several sites on R751. In some other transconjugants this same 5.5-kb segment was integrated into the E. coli chromosome. This segment could transfer a second time onto R751. Transfer was RecA independent. The transferred segment included the entire EcoRI-D fragment, and thus the clindamycin-erythromycin resistance determinant, from pBF4.
