One hundred seven men with Haemophilus ducreyi-positive chancroid were assigned to receive 300 mg of rosoxacin as a single dose or 150 mg twice daily for 3 days. Ulcers and buboes were followed clinically and bacteriologically for 1 month. Of 40 evaluable males on the 3-day regimen, 38 (95%) were cured, while only 14 of 23 (61%) males on the single-dose regimen were cured; this regimen was discontinued. There was one ulcer relapse at day 21 in both groups; the one relapse in the single-dose group had a persistent culture-positive bubo. Eight of nine (89%) buboes followed to the endpoint on the 3-day rosoxacin regimen were cured, versus three of six (50%) on the single-dose regimen. Adverse effects were mainly related to the central nervous system but were minor and did not require intervention. None of the treatment failures was due to organisms resistant to rosoxacin, and failure of the single-dose regimen presumably was related to duration of tissue levels rather than to drug resistance. Administration of 150 mg of rosoxacin twice daily for 3 days is an effective regimen for the therapy of chancroid and is a reasonable alternative to other short-course regimens.
