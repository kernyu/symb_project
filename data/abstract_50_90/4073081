The efficacy and safety of ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid in the treatment of patients with infections of soft tissue, bone, and joint were evaluated in this open study. Clinical diagnoses included osteomyelitis, soft tissue abscess or ulcer, cellulitis, bite wound, traumatic or postoperative cellulitis, necrotizing fasciitis, septic arthritis, septic bursitis, and septic thrombophlebitis. Trauma or underlying disease such as diabetes mellitus or vascular insufficiency was common (more than 50 percent) in the patient population. Clinical efficacy was evaluable in 66 patients who received 3 g of ticarcillin and 0.1 g of clavulanic acid every four or six hours for a mean of 23.4 days. A satisfactory clinical response was observed in 92 percent of the patients. Major pathogens isolated were Enterobacteriaceae, anaerobic cocci, Staphylococcus aureus, and beta-hemolytic Streptococcus. Of the 143 isolates recovered from 55 bacteriologically evaluable cases, 87 percent were eradicated by therapy. Overall, a satisfactory bacteriologic outcome occurred in 93 percent of the patients, and the pathogen(s) persisted in 7 percent. More than 98 percent of the isolates were susceptible to ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid in vitro. Emergence of resistance during therapy occurred with three strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Adverse drug-related reactions required discontinuation of treatment in two patients, although other minor abnormal laboratory findings were common. These results indicate that ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid offers safe and effective therapy for infections of soft tissue, bone, and joint.
