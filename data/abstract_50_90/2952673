Symptoms of syphilis have evolved over the ages. In the 16th century, they were essentially cutaneomucous ones. While the intensity of the symptoms decreased localization of the infection in the various organs--mainly those of the cardiovascular and nervous system--gradually appeared. Over a period of years following the introduction of penicillin therapy, the cutaneous and visceral stages became less common. Reminder of the chief serological reactions and of some aspects of the experimental syphilis in the rabbit, similar to certain forms of human syphilis--a strong but late penicillin therapy has been proven ineffective in humans as well as in animals. It is to be regretted that numerous methods of using penicillin (all over the world), had been, from the beginning--except in a few cases--of a purely empirical nature. The authors emphasize--with proof to support their opinion--the failure of antibiotic therapy, which can explain the recent reappearance of hepatic and nervous localizations that had disappeared for 30 years. Despite views to the contrary the authors conclude that penicillin has in no way resolved all the problems raised by the treatment of syphilis.
