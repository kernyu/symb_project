We have transformed a Saccharomyces cerevisiae host with an S. cerevisiae genomic library contained in the shuttle vector YEp24 and screened the resultant transformants for resistance to ketoconazole (Kc), an inhibitor of the cytochrome P-450 (P-450) enzyme lanosterol 14 alpha-demethylase. Two plasmids were isolated which transformed yeast to both increased resistance to Kc and increased levels of total P-450. Hybrid-selection and immunoprecipitation experiments showed that these plasmids, pVK1 and pVK2, contained the structural gene for an S. cerevisiae P-450. This conclusion was confirmed by the nucleotide sequence of a portion of pVK2, which revealed an open reading frame encoding a characteristic P-450 heme-binding region.
