The frequency of recombination between Streptomyces hygroscopicus var. yingchengensis and Streptomyces qingfengmyceticus as a result of interspecific protoplast fusion was 4.5 x 10(-4). Characterization of biological properties revealed differences in spore mass color, drug resistance, antimicrobial activity, and antibiotic production capacity between the recombinants and their parents. Two recombinant strains, FL-42 and FL-48, exhibited production of the antibiotics originally elaborated by the two parents individually. They also produced two compounds with antimicrobial activity that their parents could not synthesize.
