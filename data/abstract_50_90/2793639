The prevalence of high-level aminoglycoside resistance among Enterococcus faecalis at the Memphis VA Medical Center was 23.6% (59 of 250 isolates) from October to December 1986. Hybridization to a probe cloned from Ent. faecalis pIP1800 for 6' acetyltransferase-2" phosphotransferase (AAC6'-APH2") was observed in 55 (93.2%) of the resistant isolates and was associated with gentamicin resistance. Hybridization to a probe cloned from Ent. faecalis pJH1 for 3', 5" phosphotransferase type III (APH3', 5" III) was observed in 28 (47.4%) and was associated with streptomycin resistance. Twenty-five of the 32 isolates which were resistant to both gentamicin and streptomycin hybridized to both probes. Cell mating in conjunction with hybridization indicated that the AAC6'-APH2" gene is transferred separately from that for APH3', 5" (III), and the streptomycin resistant gene is cotransferred with the latter. The gentamicin-streptomycin resistant isolates therefore contain genes from two Ent. faecalis plasmids, and resistance to these two antibiotics appears to transfer separately. The genetic homogeneity of these isolates suggests nosocomial transmission of enterococci.
