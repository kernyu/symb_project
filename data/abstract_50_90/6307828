A revised sequence of the tetracycline-resistance gene of pBR322 is reported. The change, the presence of an additional CG base pair at position 526, adjusts the published sequence to allow an open reading frame from nucleotides 86-1273 (new number) and increases the size of the plasmid to 4363 bp. The predicted polypeptide encoded by this region would contain 396 amino acid residues and have a calculated Mr of 41518. A polypeptide of the predicted size has been reported previously when pBR322 is used as template in the maxicell system.
