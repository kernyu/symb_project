Mutants of Candida albicans resistant to aculeacin A, a yeast cell-wall inhibitor, were isolated after mutagenesis with ultraviolet light. The parental strain was sensitive to 0.1 approximately 0.5 microgram/ml of the antibiotic. In contrast, the minimum inhibitory concentration for the mutants ranged from 50 to 200 microgram/ml. Except for papulocandin, another cell-wall inhibitor, the antibiotic susceptibility of the mutants was similar to the parental strain. The parent strain and the aculeacin resistant mutants exhibited similar morphological changes at subinhibitory levels of aculeacin and had comparable growth rates on complex media. The lipid and sterol content of the parent and the mutants were significantly different. For example, the total lipid content was two-fold higher in the mutant strains. Drug resistance in the mutants was specific for aculeacin and papulocandin and appeared to be associated with alteration in the lipid composition of membranes.
