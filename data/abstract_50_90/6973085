Cells of wild-type Haemophilus influenzae and of a mismatch-repair-deficient mutant (hex-) were grown in a chemically defined medium containing either thymidine or 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BUdR). Spontaneous mutation frequencies to resistance against 3 antibiotics observed for the thymidine cultures were 10-30 times higher for the hex- mutant. The mutation frequencies observed for the BUdR hex- culture were increased by another 10 times while those for the wild-type suspension did not differ from the frequencies seen in the thymidine medium.
