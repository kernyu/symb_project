The minimal inhibition concentration of Tetracycline was tested in 177 strains of gram positive and gram negative species of bacteria from the vagina which were found to be resistant to Tetracycline in the Agardiffusion Test. 170 of the 177 strains (96%) were inhibited with a Tetracycline concentration of 512 microgram/ml. Six Klebsiella-enterobacter strains and one proteus morgaini strain needed a minimal inhibition concentration of 1024 microgram/ml. For a successful local treatment of vaginitis by Tetracycline against species highly resistant to Tetracycline local Tetracycline levels of 1000 microgram/ml or better have to be obtained. Concomitant preventive treatment of fungi for instance, with amphotericin containing drugs such as mysteclin is indicated.
