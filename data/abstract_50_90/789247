The resistance of 2,314 bacterial strains from 1968 to 1972 was investigated drawing on case histories from the Munich University Urological Clinic. Using the disc-diffusion method 12,160 sensitivity tests were conducted with these strains against gentamicin, co-trimoxazole, ampicillin, tetracycline and chloramphenicol. The material was compiled from 35,000 individual data by means of modern electronic data processing and evaluated according to variable criteria. As expected the incidence of resistance in hospital-acquired pathogens was considerably higher than that in community-acquired pathogens; however, the resistance pattern of hosptial-acquired pathogens remained essentially unchanged from 1968 to 1972, whereas a significant increase of resistance in community-acquired infections was recorded. It can thus be concluded that the methods used in this clinic for combatting hospital infection and a more critical attitude towards anti-bacterial therapy have had positive results. An express warning is issued against unspecific antibacterial therapy which is often administered outside the clinic on the pretext of long-term therapy. In the light of the resistance situation of urinary tract pathogens, antibiotics should be used sparingly, keeping in mind the acidification of urine and the wash-out principle by means of high fluid intake.
