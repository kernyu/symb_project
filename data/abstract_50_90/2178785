A wild strain of A. giganteus was transformed to hygromycin B resistance using a bacterial resistance gene under the control of A. nidulans sequences. Stable transformants arose by heterogenous integration, mainly of tandem repeats of vector DNA at various sites in the host genome. Between 6 and 30 resistant colonies were obtained per microgram DNA per 3 x 10(3) viable protoplasts. Vector DNA could be recovered by transformation of Escherichia coli with undigested genomic DNA from Aspergillus giganteus transformants.
