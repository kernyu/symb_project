The mutagenic action of SV40 in permanent lines of Chinese hamster cells (CHO-K1 and V79) was investigated with the aid of different resistance markers. The markers studied had resistance to 8-azaguanine (25 and 30 mug/ml), aminopterin (3.3--5.5X10(-3) mug/ml), colchicine (6.5 and 7.0X10(-2) mug/ml) and 5-bromodeoxyuridine (50--120 mug/ml), respectively. After virus infection the mutation frequencies were increased by one (azaguanine, aminopterin) and two (colchicine) orders of magnitude as compared with spontaneous mutation frequencies. In contrast, it was not possible to enhance the frequency of mutation to BUdR resistance. On the other hand, the ability to proliferate in HAT medium was induced in three of five BUdR-resistant cell clones by infection with SV40. The resistance induced by SV40 was stable when isolated clones were cultured under non-selective conditions. Mechanisms are proposed that may be responsible for the mutagenic action of SV40.
