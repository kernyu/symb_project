An efficient method for introducing two (or four) codons into a cloned gene has been developed. Single-stranded (ss) hexameric linkers are inserted into a plasmid linearized at cohesive-end restriction sites. The resultant 6 (or 12)-bp insertion creates a new 6-bp restriction site. Plasmids containing linker insertions are enriched by using biochemical selection, or selected by using a kanamycin-resistance (KmR) cassette (biological selection). A total of 57 new linkers have been designed, and compatible KmR cassettes flanked by eleven different restriction sites have been constructed. Two-codon insertions into the tetracycline-resistance (TcR) gene of pBR322 yielded a series of new plasmid vectors. Moreover, proteins with internally duplicated domains have been constructed from beta-lactamase (ApR) insertions into the ApR gene of pBR322. Some of the resulting "gemini" proteins retained the beta-lactamase activity.
