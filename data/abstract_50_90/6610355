We report the case of a 53-year-old woman with a mixed pneumococcus-staphylococcus pneumonia, in which both organisms were recovered from both sputum and blood. Streptococcus pneumoniae persisted in sputum 48 hours after initiation of high-dose intravenous penicillin G. When nafcillin was substituted for penicillin G, both pneumococci and staphylococci were eradicated from blood and sputum. This strain of Streptococcus pneumoniae was highly susceptible to penicillin G, but the associated strain of Staphylococcus aureus was not. The staphylococcus produced large amounts of a penicillin -degrading betalactamase . We reviewed the records of ten cases of pneumococcus pneumonia from the Wayne State University-Detroit Medical Center admitted from March 1978 to April 1981, in which sputum cultures were repeated within one to ten days after penicillin G had been initiated. At second cultures of sputum, Streptococcus pneumoniae was recovered in none of these latter cases. We further showed that on a blood agar culture plate in the presence of penicillin G, a beta-lactamase positive strain of Staphylococcus aureus allowed growth of Streptococcus pneumoniae. Therefore, despite penicillin therapy, Staphylococcus aureus in sputum may facilitate the persistence of Streptococcus pneumoniae.
