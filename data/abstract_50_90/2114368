It has been presumed that gamma interferon (IFN-gamma), which plays an essential role in antilisterial resistance, is produced late in Listeria monocytogenes infection. In the present study, however, IFN-gamma was detected in the bloodstreams and spleens of mice from days 1 to 4 of L. monocytogenes infection by both a double-sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and an immunohistochemical technique, suggesting that endogenous IFN-gamma is produced early but not late in L. monocytogenes infection.
