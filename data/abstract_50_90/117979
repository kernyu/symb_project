Neisseria gonorrhoeae infects superficial membranes of the eyes, oropharynx, genital tract, and rectum prior to dissemination. Gonococcal isolates cultured from patients with disseminated gonococcal infections (DGI) show resistance to serum bacteriolysis, are very sensitive to penicillin, and have characteristic growth requirements for certain amino acids. DGI is characterized by recurrent chills and fever, polyarthralgias and/or polyarthritis (with effusions), and skin lesions. The skin manifestations of DGI include vesicopustules, hemorrhagic bullae, and petechiae. These lesions are found over the juxta-articular areas of the hands (extensor surfaces) or the feet (dorsal aspects). Focal and disseminated gonococcal infections are now treated with several types of penicillin regimens, tetracycline, or spectinomycin.
