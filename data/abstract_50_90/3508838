The study was carried out to find out the efficacy of glucose oxidase as an adjunct to penicillin and its comparison with cloxacillin on fifty penicillin resistant staphylococcal isolates. There is an unequivocal evidence that the combined use of glucose oxidase and penicillin is superior in controlling penicillin resistant coagulase positive staphylococcal infections in comparison to cloxacillin.
