Growth of multiply resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis BV strains at 45 C resulted in the independent elimination of tetracycline resistance, of kanamycin resistance coupled with oxacillin resistance, or of penicillinase activity. The pH optimum for the elimination of kanamycin and oxacillin resistance was 5.6, whereas that for elimination of penicillinase activity was 8.0. The genetic determinant for penicillinase activity was linked with the genetic determinants for the active uptake of mannitol and beta-glucosides, ribose fermentation, and phospho beta-glucosidase activity. The penicillinase linkage group also contained determinants for phage adsorption, restriction, and modification, and for growth factor requirements of still unknown nature. The same linkage group, which is apparently of extrachromosomal nature, was eliminated from several S. epidermidis BV strains. By selection for novobiocin resistance, deletion mutants affecting several loci of the penicillinase plasmid were isolated. The isolation of restriction-negative and modification-negative mutants which retained phage susceptibility allowed the investigation of restriction and modification phenomena. A preliminary deletion map of the polyfunctional penicillinase plasmid is proposed.
