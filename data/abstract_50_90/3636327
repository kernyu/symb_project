Twenty-one patients with infected burns were treated with 5.2 g Timentin (ticarcillin 5 g + potassium clavulanate 200 mg) three times a day for an average of 8.3 days. Staphylococcus aureus was the commonest pathogen, there being ten cases of septicaemia with this organism and all were cured. Three patients with Pseudomonas aeruginosa septicaemia and infections with methicillin-resistant S. aureus failed. No drug related side effects were noted.
