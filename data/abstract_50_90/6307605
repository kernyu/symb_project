Ceftriaxone (Rocephin 13-9904) was tested against 409 isolates of gram-negative bacilli. No difference was found in the susceptibility of the 262 gentamicin-sensitive or 147 gentamicin-resistant isolates to ceftriaxone. Comparison with other third-generation cephalosporins showed that ceftriaxone was as active as or more active than lamoxactam, cefoperazone, cefotaxime and ceftazidime against Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus sp., Klebsiella. Ceftriaxone was not as active as ceftazidime against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but was more active than lamoxactam, cefoperazone and cefotaxime.
