Three cephalosporin-related antibiotics and nine other antimicrobial agents were studied for in vitro effectiveness against 54 recently isolated strains of Salmonella. Minimal inhibitory concentrations determined by the plate dilution method demonstrated the following percentages of resistance: ampicillin, 6%; tetracycline, 13%; streptomycin, 52%; sulfadiazine, 94%; cephaloglycin, 96%; and lincomycin, 100%. No strains were resistant to cephalothin, cephaloridine, chloramphenicol, colistimethate, kanamycin, and polymyxin B. The commonest serotype studied, S. typhimurium, showed the greatest antibiotic resistance, with 21% resistant to ampicillin, 36% resistant to tetracycline, and 71% resistant to streptomycin. Cephalothin and cephaloridine were highly effective in vitro but inhibitory concentrations of 20 to 40 mug of cephaloglycin per ml were required for the majority of Salmonella strains.
