Changes in susceptibility to four aminoglycosides (gentamycin, amikacin, tobramycin, sisomicin) of bacterial strains, isolated from in-patients with urinary tract infections at the "Santa Maria della Scala" Hospital of Siena, in the period January-April in three consecutive years (1980, 1981, 1982) were studied. The change susceptibility patterns were related to the use of the four antimicrobial drugs in the same periods. Emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains was seen after a wider use, whereas an increasing number of susceptible strains was observed after reducing use of antimicrobial drugs.
