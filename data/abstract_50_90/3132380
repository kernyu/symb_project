Temafloxacin, a new difluoro quinolone, inhibited the majority of Enterobacteriaceae at less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml. It was 4-8-fold less active than ciprofloxacin and 2-fold less active than ofloxacin. Cefotaxime and imipenem-resistant isolates such as Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter spp. were inhibited. Temafloxacin inhibited Neisseria, Branhamella, and Haemophilus species at less than 0.25 microgram/ml. Methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Clostridium spp. were inhibited at concentrations less or equal to that of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin.
