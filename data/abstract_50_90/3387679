Coagulase-positive staphylococci were found in the throats of 46 rooks (69 per cent) and 47 gulls (21 per cent) out of totals of 67 and 229 birds, respectively. Of 111 strains isolated from throat swabs 86 (77.5 per cent) were classified as Staphylococcus aureus and 25 strains (22.5 per cent) as Staphylococcus intermedius. Of the S aureus strains 82 per cent from rooks and 50 per cent from gulls were biotyped. Most of them were identified as biotypes D and B, only a few as biotype A, and none as biotype C. Moreover, among the 24 S intermedius strains (96 per cent) biotypes 1 and 2 could be differentiated according to the type of growth on crystal violet agar and their ability to produce acetoin and acid from maltose, mannitol and trehalose.
