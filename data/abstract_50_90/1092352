A spontaneous mutant of Saccharomyces cerevisiae resistant to trichodermin has been isolated. It displays cross resistance both in vivo and in vitro to a number of sesquiterpene antibiotics (fusarenon X, trichothecin and verrucarin A) and to the chemically unrelated antibiotic anisomycin. The mutation conferring resistance to anisomycin and trichodermin is expressed in the 60-S subunit of the yeast 80-S ribosome. Mutant ribosomes bind [-14C]trichodermin much less efficiently than wild type ribosomes, suggesting that resistance may be due, at least in part, to this property. However, both types of ribosomes bind [-3H] anisomycin equally. These results suggest that anisomycin and trichodermin have different binding sites on the 60-S subunit of eukaryotic ribosomes, even though previous results have shown that both antibiotics bind to mutually exclusive sites.
