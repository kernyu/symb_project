A benzimidazole resistant strain of Haemonchus contortus was passaged through lambs only or from lambs to calves and back into lambs. Changes in response to thiabendazole were monitored by using an egg hatch test at each animal passage and by a controlled experiment on adult worms at the final passage in lambs. An increased level of resistance was shown for the isolate during its passage through calves by the egg hatch test, although this was not supported on the adult worms in sheep using a single dose rate of 66 mg/kg of thiabendazole.
