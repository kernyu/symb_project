One mutant of mitochondrial origin resistant to miconazole has been isolated and characterized in S. cerevisiae. The mutation is linked to the locus oli1, the structural gene for subunit 9 of ATPase on mitochondrial DNA. Miconazole inhibited the mitochondrial ATPase of the wild type while the enzyme of the resistant mutant was insensitive to this effect. Levels of ATP decreased to one-third of the control in the wild type in the presence of miconazole, while they were unaffected in the mutant.
