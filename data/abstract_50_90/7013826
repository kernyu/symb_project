Poly U-directed incorporation of phenylalanine and leucine into polypeptide has been described in at least 50 papers since 1961. In general, high translation activities are associated with high accuracies, and vice-versa. Moreover, a vast body of independent experimental data (effect of ethanol, temperature, urea, aminoglycosides, etc... on protein synthesis) put together here suggests that, in many circumstances, speed and accuracy of elongation are correlated. This result is to be contrasted with the view that the speed and the fidelity of protein synthesis are two opposing parameters. In this report, recent experimental data on the nature and effect of ribosomal ambiguity (ram) and streptomycin resistance (Strr) mutations are reexamined. Models on the action of streptomycin and other misreading-inducing antibiotics, as well as long-standing ideas on the control of misreading in mammalian systems are critically evaluated. An explanation is provided for the long-befuddling data on the action of gentamicin.
