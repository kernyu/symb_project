We estimate that E. coli RNA polymerase is able to form stable, rifampicin-resistant, pre-intiation complexes with Adenovirus 2 DNA at three to six binding sites. The number of RNA chains initiated from such complexes has been determined form the incorporation of gamma-32P-ATP and -GTP at two rifampicin concentrations (7 mug/ml and 24 mug/ml) and after pre-incubation at either 25 or 37 degrees C. The total number of RNA chains initiated ranges from 2.6 per Ad 2 DNA molecule at a rifampicin concentration of 24 mug/ml and pre-incubation temperature of 25 degrees C, to 5.4 per Ad 2 DNA molecule at a rifampicin concentration of 7 mug/ml and pre-incubation temperature of 37 degrees C. Efficient initiation with GTP occurs only after pre-incubation at 37 degrees C whereas initiation with ATP is equally as efficient at either pre-incubation temperature. Promoters for initiation with ATP have been localized to the leftmost 58% of the Ad 2 DNA molecule, defined by the EcoR.RI restriction endonuclease fragment A; promoters for initiation with GTP are located on the remaining 42% of the Ad2 DNA molecule. It is likely that on Adenovirus 2 DNA each RNA chain is initiated from a unique binding site which constitutes a seperate promoter for E. coli RNA polymerase.
