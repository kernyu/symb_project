Pseudomonas cepacia 4G9 utilizes 2-tridecanone as its sole carbon source and has been shown to be resistant to a variety of antibiotics. To ascertain whether any of these characteristics were plasmid mediated, Escherichia coli HB101 was transformed with plasmid DNA isolated from Pseudomonas cepacia 4G9. No 2-tridecanone-utilizing transformants were obtained. Tetracycline (Tc)- and ampicillin (Ap)- resistant transformants were obtained at a low frequency. Plasmid deoxyribonucleic acid from antibiotic-resistant E. coli HB101 transformants had molecular weights of 2.9 x 10(6) for pJW2 Tcr and 5.4 x 10(6) for pJW3 Apr as determined by electron microscopy. Electron microscopy of plasmid deoxyribonucleic acid from P. cepacia 4G9 revealed a single plasmid species, pJW1 of 1.78 x 10(6). Tetracycline resistance in both P. cepacia 4G9 and E. coli HB101(pJW2) was inducible, whereas ampicillin resistance in P. cepacia 4G9 was constitutive. The level of ampicillin resistance coded by pJW3 was lower in P. cepacia 4G9 than in the transformant E. coli HB101(pJW3).
