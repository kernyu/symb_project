The in vitro activity of ceftazidime against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and P. cepacia isolates from patients with cystic fibrosis was compared with that of other antipseudomonal drugs. Ceftazidime was as potent as imipenem against P. aeruginosa and the only drug effective against P. cepacia. An evaluation of the elimination kinetics of ceftazidime in 20 cystic fibrosis patients revealed an elimination half-life of 1.76 hours, an apparent distribution volume of 0.27 liters/kg, and a serum clearance rate of 133.9 ml/minute/1.73m2. Urinary recovery of ceftazidime was 87 percent within the first 24 hours after administration of the drug, with 65 percent recovered in the first two-hour fraction. Probenecid administration had no effect on the elimination kinetics of ceftazidime. Forty-three patients who had either shown no response to conventional therapy or had sputum Pseudomonas isolates that were susceptible only to ceftazidime received 75 courses of therapy. In 67 percent of these patients, the clinical response, when evaluated using an objective clinical efficacy scoring system, was considered favorable. Clinical failures were not associated with the development of drug resistance. Thus, ceftazidime can be recommended for the treatment of acute pulmonary exacerbations in patients with cystic fibrosis.
