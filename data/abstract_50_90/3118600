One hundred and sixty clinical isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculois were tested for their sensitivity to pyrazinamide (PZA) using the conventional proportion method (Middlebrook 7H10 agar) and the results compared to the pyrazinamidase (PZase) activity of the strains. The correlation between strains susceptible to PZA and the production of PZase was 99%. None of the isolates were exclusively resistant to PZA. At present the rate of initial PZA resistance in Kanton Zurich is 0.6%.
