Properties of several, well characterized, tetracycline resistance determinants were compared. The determinants in Tn1721 and Tn10 (both from Gram-negative bacteria) each contain two genes; one encodes a repressor that regulates both its own transcription and that of a membrane protein that confers resistance by promoting efflux of the drug. Determinants from Gram-positive bacteria also encode efflux proteins, but expression of resistance is probably regulated by translational attenuation. The likely tetracycline binding site (a common dipeptide) in each efflux protein was predicted. The presence of the common binding site is consistent with the ability of an efflux protein originating in Bacillus species to be expressed in Escherichia coli.
