Inosine pranobex-BAN injected intraperitoneally at a daily dose of 500 mg/kg for 15 days into young Sprague-Dawley rats, beginning 24 hours after the implantation of Yoshida ascites tumor cells and the injection of cell-free ascites fluid from the same neoplasia, increased the resistance to the tumor in both cases. This antitumor activity of the drug was mediated by its action on cellular immunity of the host. In our model we considered the role of macrophages.
