In the present study the comparative in-vitro and in-vivo efficacy of Go 10213 was compared with those of metronidazole, secnidazole, tinidazole, ornidazole and nimorazole against a metronidazole-resistant strain of T. vaginalis. Go 10213 was found to be superior in activity. It appears more promising than the drugs mentioned above on the basis of the evidence presented.
