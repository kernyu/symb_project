Our previous work has demonstrated that whereas near-UV radiation is not a mutagen for Haemophilus influenzae cells, it does induce mutations in purified transforming DNA. In order to test various hypotheses concerning this difference, we have irradiated cells at 334 and 365 nm, then lysed them and assayed the DNA for induced mutations and for inactivation of transforming ability. The inactivation was only a little lower than observed with highly purified transforming DNA. The DNA irradiated in vivo was mutated at both wavelengths, but with considerably lower efficiency than was purified DNA. Neither incubation of the cells after irradiation and before lysis nor freezing and thawing the cells significantly changed the amount of mutation. It is concluded that there is some protection of the DNA against premutational lesions by the in vivo environment, but that it is not enough to account for the total lack of mutation of the cells. A probable explanation of this lack of cell mutation is that lethal lesions in the cells are induced much more readily than premutational lesions.
