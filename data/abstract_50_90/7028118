2-Deoxyglucose and 3-O-methylglucose were used to assess endotoxin-induced changes in glucose transport in rat adipocytes. 6 h after Escherichia coli endotoxin injection insulin-stimulated 2-deoxyglucose uptake was significantly depressed (V decreased, Km unaltered), phosphorylation of 2-deoxyglucose was seemingly unimpaired; basal 3-methylglucose entry was significantly increased, insulin-stimulated uptake was unaltered. Insulin significantly reduced Km in control and endotoxin-treated cells. Cytochalasin B-insensitive uptake of both 2-deoxy-glucose and 3-methylglucose, a small fraction of total transport, increased significantly in endotoxic cells. Endotoxin reduced spermine- and insulin-stimulated 2-deoxyglucose uptake to a similar extent. Results are consistent with the hypotheses that (1) a site of endotoxin-induced insulin resistance is at the cell membrane level and may reflect a decrease in number of activity of effective carrier units, rather than alterations in affinity, (2) endotoxin does not compromise the hexokinase system, (3) the cell membrane-localized effect of endotoxin on hexose transport is not necessarily mediated by the insulin receptor and (4) the entry of 2-deoxyglucose and 3-methyl-glucose may involve two separate transport systems.
