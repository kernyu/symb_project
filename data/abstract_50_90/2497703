Using agar dilution, we determined MICs of penicillin, cefoxitin, ceftriaxone, cefmetazole, tetracycline, and spectinomycin for 129 strains of Neisseria gonorrhoeae. All strains were susceptible to ceftriaxone (MIC range, less than or equal to 0.008 to 0.06 micrograms/ml) and spectinomycin (16 to 32 micrograms/ml). The MICs for 50, 90, and 100% of strains tested were 1.0, 2.0, and greater than 8.0 micrograms/ml; 0.12, 1.0, and greater than 8.0 micrograms/ml; 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 micrograms/ml; and 1.0, 2.0, and greater than 8.0 micrograms/ml for cefmetazole, penicillin, cefoxitin, and tetracycline, respectively. Seven strains were beta-lactamase producers; eight were chromosomally resistant to penicillin. There was a log-linear relation for non-beta-lactamase-producing strains between the MICs of cefmetazole, cefoxitin, and tetracycline and the MIC of penicillin (Pearson r = 0.787, 0.544, and 0.358, respectively).
