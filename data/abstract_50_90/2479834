L5178Y/TK 3.7.2C cells are used for the assessment of chemical mutagenesis caused by presumptive TK gene mutations or multiple loci mutations affecting the TK locus that result in dose-related increases in resistance to the toxic thymidine analog, trifluorothymidine (TFT). This study was based upon our general observation that the incidence of TFTres in these cells could vary with the incubation temperature. As a result of these studies, we found that: (1) a substantial proportion of presumptive TK-/- variants produced by the mutagens 2-aminofluorene (2-AF), N-acetylaminofluorene (AAF), benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P), 3-methylcholanthrene (3MCA), hycanthone methanesulfonate (Hyc), or methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) are more resistant to TFT at 37 degrees C than at 28 degrees C (or 39 degrees C than at 33 degrees C), (2) the loss of resistance to TFT was most notable in the small-colony variant population, (3) mutagen-derived variants become less resistant as the TFT concentration is increased from 4 micrograms/ml to 50 micrograms/ml, an effect that is more pronounced at 28 degrees C than at 37 degrees C, and (4) stock 3.7.2C cells develop a persistent TFTres due to sharply decreased TK activity when exposed to 40 degrees C for at least 24 h. These data demonstrate two different responses by these cells with respect to temperature stability at the TK locus and suggest that the degree of TFTres is influenced by both temperature and concentration of selective agent in this presumptive gene/chromosomal mutation assay.
