In a prospective, double-blind trial prophylactic cotrimoxazole produced a highly significant reduction in the incidence of bacteriuria after prostatectomy. Only two out of 38 patients who received the drug developed bacteriuria compared with 19 out of 36 patients on placebo. Klebsiella-Enterobacter spp and coagulase-negative staphylococci were responsible for most infections. Although co-trimoxazole prophylaxis is obviously effective, widespread use might increase the incidence of bacterial resistance.
