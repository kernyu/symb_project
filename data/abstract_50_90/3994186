Previous studies of the effects of acute alcohol ingestion in normal subjects have used measures of left ventricular performance that are altered by changes in preload and afterload and in contractile state. In studies involving nine healthy, young adults, we measured sensitive load-independent end-systolic indices of left ventricular contractility over a wide range of pressures generated by methoxamine infusion before and after oral alcohol administration. Echocardiography was used in conjunction with calibrated carotid pulse tracings. Alcohol ingestion resulted in a fall (p less than 0.01) in left ventricular end-diastolic dimension (a measure of preload), end-systolic wall stress (a measure of afterload), and systemic vascular resistance, while not changing the left ventricular shortening fraction. In contrast, the end-systolic pressure-dimension slope decreased (p less than 0.001) and the rate-corrected velocity of left ventricular fiber shortening at an end-systolic wall stress of 50 g/cm2 fell (p less than 0.001). Thus, when load-independent assessment of left ventricular contractility is done, acute alcohol ingestion has a myocardial depressant effect greater than previously suspected.
