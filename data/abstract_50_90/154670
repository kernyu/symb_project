The nucleotide sequence of mitochondrial DNA of a cytoplasmic "petite" mutant of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is reported. The DNA has a repeat length of 1060 base pairs and contains a genetic marker (oli-1) for the ATPase proteolipid. The nucleotide sequence reveals the presence of part of the structural gene of the subunit-9 proteolipid of the ATPase complex and an extended A+T-rich region adjacent to the carboxyl-terminal end of the gene. The structural gene sequence agrees with the primary structure of the protein. These studies point out the feasibility of using the DNA of appropriately marked "petite" mutants to obtain the sequence of mitochondrial genes.
