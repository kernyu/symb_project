The effect of nonsteroid antiinflammatory drugs (NAID) such as voltaren, acetylsalicylic acid, indometacin and naproxen on the efficacy of immunostimulators in treatment of infections caused by Proteus and Staphylococcus was studied. It was shown that except naproxen the NAID were capable of decreasing resistance to Proteus infections. Acetylsalicylic acid increased resistance to staphylococcal infections. The rest of the drugs did not change it. Prodigiozan increased resistance to the infections at the background of the NAID. However, volteran and indometacin lowered its effect in infections caused by Proteus. Levamisol stimulated resistance of mice to the infections at the background of volteran and increased resistance to Proteus infections lowered by acetylsalicylic acid. Methyluracyl was not able to increase resistance to the infections at the background of the NAID. It only increased resistance to Proteus infections lowered by acetylsalicylic acid. Levamisol and methyluracyl did not as a rule increase efficacy of antibiotic therapy at the background of the NAID.
