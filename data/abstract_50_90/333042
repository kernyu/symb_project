Multiple antibiotic resistance was transferred from a clinical isolate of Bacteroides fragilis to a strain of Escherichia coli K12. Resistance to ampicillin, amoxicillin, cephalothin, tetracycline, minocycline, and chloramphenicol was transferred as a unit, but the resistance markers became segregated during storage of the recipient strains.
