We have recently reported that the expression of an in vitro mutated, kinase-defective insulin receptor (A/K1018) leads to cellular insulin resistance when expressed in Rat 1 fibroblasts. That is, despite the presence of normal numbers of activatable native insulin receptors in the host cell, the A/K1018 receptors prevent the normal receptors from phosphorylating endogenous substrates and from signalling insulin action, perhaps by competing for limiting amounts of these substrates. We report here that insulin-like growth factor I-stimulated phosphorylation of two endogenous substrate proteins, pp220 and pp170, is also inhibited in cells expressing A/K1018 receptors. Because insulin-like growth factor I stimulation of glucose uptake is not inhibited in cells with A/K1018 receptors while pp220 and pp170 phosphorylation is inhibited, it is unlikely that either pp220 or pp170 are involved in mediating the stimulation of glucose transport. In contrast, insulin-like growth factor I-mediated stimulation of mitogenesis is inhibited in cells with A/K1018 receptors. Thus, pp170 or pp220 could be involved in mitogenic signalling. We also report that both H2O2 and tetradecanoylphorbolacetate stimulate glucose transport normally in cells with A/K1018 receptors. Phorbol esters also lead to the phosphorylation of both normal and A/K1018 receptors on serine and/or threonine. This argues that phorbol esters or H2O2 bypass the normal proximal steps in signalling insulin action.
