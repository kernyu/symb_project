Lymphokine (LK) treatment of resident peritoneal macrophages from C3H/HeN mice induced two antimicrobial activities against Leishmania tropica: increased resistance of activated macrophages to infection with amastigotes and intracellular destruction of those parasites that entered activated cells. The onset and duration of these two antimicrobial activities were quite different. Resistance to infection was observed as early as 4 hr after the addition of LK, became maximal at 8 hr, and persisted in a subpopulation of treated cells for as long as 72 hr. In contrast, intracellular killing occurred with as little as 4 hr of LK treatment after infection, and maximal killing was observed in cultures exposed to LK 24 hr. Intracellular killing capacity of lymphokine-treated cells was progressively lost in macrophages treated longer than 12 hr before exposure to parasites. This decay in ability to destroy intracellular L. tropica was also seen in macrophages cultured longer than 12 hr before LK treatment, and may reflect loss of macrophage responsiveness to LK with increasing time in vitro. Thus, treatment of macrophages with lymphokines induced both a stable change in cell-parasite interactions, resistance to infection, and a short-lived capacity to destroy intracellular amastigotes.
