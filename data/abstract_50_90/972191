High-titer preparations of Klebsiella bacteriocins (klebocins) were obtained by using mitomycin to induce standard strains of Klebsiella. Of 296 clinical isolates of Klebsiella, 67% could be typed on the basis of their sensitivity to klebocins. The method proposed in this paper affords a standard basis for the further development of klebocin typing as a suitable procedure for hospital laboratories concerned with epidemiological investigations of hospital-associated infections. Evidence is also provided to show that high-titered klebocin typing can be used in conjunction with biochemical typing to provide a sensitive epidemiological marker for Klebsiella.
