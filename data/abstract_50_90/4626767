In a series of 52 patients the combination of trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole was used for the treatment of urinary tract infection and the results are analyzed with respect to the clinical diagnosis and bacterial etiology. There was complete agreement between in vitro sensitivity and clinical response except in the case of one strain of Streptococcus fecalis. The combination of drugs was effective against some bacterial strains which were resistant to the commonly used antimicrobial agents.
