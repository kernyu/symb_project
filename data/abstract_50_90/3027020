3'-Aminoglycoside phosphotransferases [APH(3')] were chosen as a model to study the evolution and the transfer of aminoglycoside resistance genes under natural conditions. Comparison of the amino acid sequences of APH(3') enzymes from transposons Tn903 (type I) and Tn5 (type II) detected in Gram-negative bacteria, from the Gram-positive Staphylococcus and Streptococcus (type III), from the butirosin-producing Bacillus circulans (type IV) and from a neomycin-producing Streptomyces fradiae (type V) indicate that they have diverged from a common ancestor. These structural data support the hypothesis that the antibiotic-producing strains were the source of certain resistance determinants. We have shown that kanamycin resistance in Campylobacter coli BM2509 was due to the synthesis of an APH(3')-III, an enzyme not detected previously in a Gram-negative bacterium. The genes encoding APH(3')-III in Streptococcus and Campylobacter are identical. These findings constitute evidence for a recent in-vivo transfer of DNA between Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.
