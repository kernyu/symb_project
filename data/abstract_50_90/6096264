The mode of action of DNA gyrase inhibiting antibiotics is explained. The function of DNA gyrase is to generate negatively supercoiled DNA. This conformation is of importance, as the genetic information carried by the DNA molecule can be recognized by some enzymes only if DNA is negatively supercoiled. As those enzymes play a critical role in DNA replication, transcription, recombination, and repair, DNA gyrase is essential for bacterial viability. Resistance to these drugs is conferred by mutations of the transport system or the DNA synthesizing system and is designated as nal A, B, C and nal D.
