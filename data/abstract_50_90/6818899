The in vitro synergistic activity of N-formimidoyl thienamycin and amikacin was determined against gentamicin-resistant enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus. N-Formimidoyl thienamycin showed synergism with amikacin against 19 of the gentamicin-resistant strains, 14 of the 49 strains of S. aureus, and only 1 strain of the 46 P. aeruginosa isolates.
