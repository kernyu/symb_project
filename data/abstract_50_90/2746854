The pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of sulbactam/ampicillin (SBT/ABPC) were evaluated in 21 children with a variety of infections. The results obtained are summarized as follows. 1. Pharmacokinetics in 4 children, each receiving a single dose of 60 mg/kg, were evaluated. The average half-life of SBT was 1.03 hours and that of ABPC was 0.83 hour. 2. In vitro antimicrobiol activity (MIC) of SBT/ABPC in which SBT and ABPC are combined at a ratio of 1:2 was stronger than ABPC alone and was quite effective against Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus influenzae, but activity against Escherichia coli was relatively low. Antimicrobial activity of SBT/ABPC against S. aureus was almost equal to those of piperacillin (PIPC), cefazolin (CEZ) and cefmetazole (CMZ), but against H. influenzae was stronger than those of CEZ and CMZ. Activity against E. coli was lower than those of PIPC, CEZ and CMZ. 3. A total of 21 patients including 3 with pharyngitis, 10 with bronchitis, 5 with pneumonia, 1 each with acute enteritis, pyelonephritis and suspected sepsis were treated with SBT/ABPC. The clinical efficacy rate for these patients was 95.2% (20/21). The bacteriological eradication rate was 80% (8/10). 4. There were 4 instances of side effects, 1 case each of eruption, diarrhea, thrombocytosis and eosinophilia, but all symptoms were transient.
