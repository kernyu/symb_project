Human x mouse microcell hybrids resistant to G418 were constructed between mouse hepatoma cells and human x mouse whole cell hybrids containing only intact human chromosome 5 and 22 with an integrated neor-gene. Among these, microcell hybrid BG15 produced four subclones, BG15-4, BG15-6, BG15-7 and BG15-9, which contained variously sized complements of human chromosome 5. BG15-6 contained an intact human chromosome 5, BG15-7 a deleted human chromosome 5 (5pter-q22) and BG15-4 and BG15-9 a translocation between parts of human chromosome 5 (pter-qter? and pter-q23, respectively) and a mouse chromosome. Southern DNA blot analysis showed that the human dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) gene was present in all four subclones, whereas the human homolog of the v-fms gene was present in BG15-4 and 15-6, but absent from BG15-7 and 15-9. BG15-4, 15-6 and 15-9 were sensitive to diphtheria toxin, and only BG15-7 was resistant to the toxin. We used these microcell hybrids to restrict further the regional location of the gene for diphtheria toxin sensitivity to the q23 region of human chromosome 5.
