We constructed five different structures, consisting of a genetic marker flanked by directly repeated sequences 2-4 kb long, in the Bacillus subtilis chromosome. When a selective pressure was applied amplification of the marker and one of the repeats was observed in all cases. Amplification was not detected with two markers which were not flanked by the repeated sequences. The maximum amplification level observed with the different structures varied between 5 and 50. The size of the most amplified structure corresponded to 7.5% of the chromosome. Amplification was stable upon growth of cells under non-selective conditions. Each copy of an amplified gene was expressed with equal efficiency. These results indicate that chromosomal gene amplification may be useful for constructing genetically engineered B. subtilis strains.
