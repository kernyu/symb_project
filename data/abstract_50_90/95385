Regulation of the immune response by macrophages was studied with cellular resistance to Listeria monocytogenes as parameter. The use of agents which suppress macrophage activity during the induction-phase of immunity enabled the induction of protective immunity with killed listeria. Fractionation of the cell content of listeria yielded an RNA'se sensitive fraction which in a dose of 300 ng and in combination with the cationic surfactant dimethyl dioctadecyl ammonium bromide induced protective immunity against listeria.
