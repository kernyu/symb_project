Mutants of Escherichia coli defective in septum initiation, as well as in septum formation were obtained spontaneously, without mutagenic treatment, by selection of rifampin-tolerant mutants of an antibiotic-permeable strain carrying the envA mutation. The disturbed phenotype was in all mutants aggrevated the low incubation temperatures. One allele, sefA1, was studied in detail. Septum initiation, as well as septum formation, was promoted by high cell densities or by the addition of low concentrations of certain antibiotics, e.g., rifampin and chloramphenicol, to low-density cultures. The observed rifampicin depencence was studied in detail. These experiments indicated that a very modest shift-down situation suppressed the phenotype and enabled constrictions to proceed to cell separation. The rifampicin sensitivity of the partially purified deoxyribonucleic acid polymerase was not affected by the sefA1 allele, which is located close to proA and is thus distinct from envA. Growth parameters during the shift to 25 degrees C were followed in a transductant carrying HE SEFA1 allele. This constriction was characteristically blunt and did not lead to cell separation. At the time of formation of these frozen constrictions, clear zones representing a separation of wall from cytoplasmic membrane appeared. These polar tips did not inhibit expansion of the cell envelope. The phenotype of cells carrying the sefA1 allele suggests a disturbed relationship among protoplasm expansion, envelope growth, and septum formation. It is thought that the blunt constrictions observed are caused by an inability of the two septal peptidoglycan layers to fuse during an early stage of septation.
