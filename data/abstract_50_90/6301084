Mouse LA9 antimycin-resistant mutants (ANT-R) were isolated and characterized. Genetic analyses established that this phenotype is encoded within the mtDNA: (1) the ANT-R phenotype showed frequent mitotic segregation and reassortment in hybrid clonal lines; (2) it was transmitted directly in cybrid crosses; and (3) it was cotransmitted in cybrid crosses with the mitochondrial CAP-R marker. Furthermore, the genetic studies suggested that the LA9 CAP-R ANT-R cells were heteroplasmic and contained at least two mtDNA genotypes, cap-r ant-s and cap-s ant-r. Cellular respiration of the ANT-R mutant was markedly more resistant to inhibition by antimycin than that of the parental ANT-S cells. The increased resistance of cellular respiration was entirely accounted for by an increase in the resistance of mitochondrial succinate-cytochrome c oxidoreductase to antimycin inhibition. There was no detectable change in the specific activity of the oxidoreductase in mitochondria of resistant ANT-R cells nor in the sensitivity of the complex to three other specific inhibitors of the complex: TTFA, myxothiazol, and HQNO. Taken together, these studies indicate that the ANT-R phenotype is most likely encoded within the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene and, more specifically, within an antimycin binding domain.
