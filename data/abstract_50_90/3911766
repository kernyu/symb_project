Prior to clinical investigations, in vitro activities of 5-fluorocytosine (5-FC), ofloxacin (OFLX), and the combination on a strain of E. coli and of C. albicans were tested. The two drugs showed highly active on each target strain without any interaction. In clinical studies, 5 female adult patients with persistent uncomplicated UTI (3 of cystitis, 2 of pyelonephritis) caused by polymicrobial organisms (including bacteria and fungi) were treated in combination of 5-FC and oral chemotherapeutic agent. The results were both bacteriologically and symptomatically successful in all of 5 cases. Those had been poor by other antibiotic drugs in single use or 5-FC alone. Consequently, 5-FC and oral antibacterial drug combination was useful in therapy on even uncomplicated UTI due to polymicrobial organisms including fungi.
