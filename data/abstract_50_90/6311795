Hybrid plasmids capable of acting as shuttle cloning vectors in Escherichia coli and the cyanobacterium Anacystis nidulans R2 were constructed by in vitro ligation. DNA from the small endogenous plasmid of A. nidulans was combined with two E. coli vectors, pBR325 and pDPL13, to create vectors containing either two selectable antibiotic resistance markers or a single marker linked to a flexible multisite polylinker. Nonessential DNA was deleted from the polylinker containing plasmid pPLAN B2 to produce a small shuttle vector carrying part of the polylinker (pCB4). The two polylinker-containing shuttle vectors, pPLAN B2 and pCB4, transform both E. coli and A. nidulans efficiently and provide seven and five unique restriction enzyme sites, respectively, for the insertion of a variety of DNA fragments. The hybrid plasmid derived from pBR325 (pECAN1) also transforms both E. coli and A. nidulans, although at a lower frequency, and contains two unique restriction enzyme sites.
