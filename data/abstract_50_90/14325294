Using 20 clinical isolates of S. aureus (all bacteriophage 80/81 type), we found that lysostaphin inhibits the growth of all cultures at concentrations significantly lower than those observed with any of eight penicillins, a penicillin-like compound (cephalothin), or fusidic acid (a steroid antibiotic). All test cultures were shown to be resistant to penicillin G, ampicillin, and propicillin. Of the remaining penicillins (all penicillinase-insensitive), oxacillin, nafcillin, cloxacillin, and cephalothin were approximately equal in antimicrobial activity. Ancillin was slightly less active, and methicillin was even lower in potency. Cultures varied more widely in susceptibility to fusidic acid. None of the clinical isolates tested was found to be resistant to lysostaphin.
