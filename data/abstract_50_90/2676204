It was previously observed that increased dosages of the ADR1 gene, which encodes a yeast transcriptional activator required for alcohol dehydrogenase II (ADH II) expression, cause a decreased rate of growth in medium containing ethanol as the carbon source. Here we show that observed reduction in growth rate is mediated by the ADR1 protein which, when overexpressed, increases the frequency of cytoplasmic petites. Unlike previously characterized mutations known to potentiate petite formation, the ADR1 effect is dominant, with the petite frequency rising concomitantly with increasing ADR1 dosage. The ability of ADR1 to increase the frequency of mitochondrial mutation is correlated with its ability to activate ADH II transcription but is independent of the level of ADH II being expressed. Based on restoration tests using characterized mit- strains, ADR1 appears to cause non-specific deletions within the mitochondrial genome to produce rho- petites. Pedigree analysis of ADR1-overproducing strains indicates that only daughter cells become petite. This pattern is analogous to that observed for petite induction by growth at elevated temperature and by treatment with the acridine dye euflavine. One strain resistant to ADR1-induced petite formation displayed cross-resistance to petite mutation by growth at elevated temperature and euflavine treatment, yet was susceptible to petite induction by ethidium bromide. These results suggest that ADR1 overexpression disrupts the fidelity of mitochondrial DNA replication or repair.
