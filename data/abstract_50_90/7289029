1. The in vitro antibacterial activity of cefoxitin was nearly equal to that of CEZ and CET against the 6 species of clinically isolated strains. Cefoxitin, furthermore, had an antibacterial activity against the strains of P. morganii resistant to CEZ and CET. 2. Cefoxitin was applied to a total of 17 patients including 6 cases of bronchitis, 5 of pneumonia, 2 of enteritis, and 1 each of pharyngitis, laryngitis, sinusitis and lymphadenitis. The results showed an efficacy rate of 88%. In the 6 patients from whom the isolation of pathogenic organisms was possible, the bacteriological response to cefoxitin was appreciable the efficacy rate being 83%. Thus, it is considered that cefoxitin also has a significant antibacterial activity in vivo. 3. As to the side effects following the administration of cefoxitin, urticaria-like eruption was observed in 1 case, and an elevation of transaminase in another. These findings, however, became normal soon after discontinuation of cefoxitin treatment.
