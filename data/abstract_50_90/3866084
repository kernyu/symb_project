A fundamental and clinical study of ceftizoxime (CZX) suppositories was performed in pre-school and school-age children. The average time courses of CZX serum and urinary concentrations after administration of CZX suppository 250 mg (i.e. per kg body weight doses of 8.3-10.9 mg) to 4 school-age children were as follows. Serum concentrations: 6.1 micrograms/ml at 15 minutes, 6.3 micrograms/ml at 30 minutes, 3.8 micrograms/ml at 1 hour, 1.7 microgram/ml at 2 hours, 0.5 microgram/ml at 4 hours and 0.2 microgram/ml at 6 hours with a biological half-life of 1.43 hours. Urinary concentrations: 885 micrograms/ml for 0-2 hours, 209 micrograms/ml for 2-4 hours and 112 micrograms/ml for 4-6 hours with an average 6-hour urinary recovery rate of 25.6%. The clinical and biological effectiveness and adverse reactions were studied in 11 infants and school-age children afflicted with various infections (acute purulent tonsillitis, 1; acute bronchitis, 3; acute pneumonia, 4; and UTI, 3). The clinical responsiveness was "excellent" in 8, "good" in 2, and "failure" was recorded in 1, with an overall efficacy of 90.9% inclusive of "excellent" and "good". The microbiological effectiveness of CZX suppositories on presumed pathogenic organisms comprising 4 strains of H. influenzae, 1 strain of H. parainfluenzae, and 3 strains of E. coli was satisfactory, as evidenced by the substantially high eradication rate of 87.5%. The only organism that survived CZX suppository treatment was 1 strain of H. influenzae which however was greatly decreased. The only side effect was diarrhea in 1 patient, which however did not necessitate withdrawal of the drug. The only laboratory test abnormality was GOT and GPT elevation in 1 patient which was normalized within 8 days. In conclusion, CZX suppositories were found to be efficacious and safe for treatment of bacterial infections in children.
