A number of semisynthetic bicyclomycin derivatives have been prepared by modifications at various sites of the molecule. The preparation, characterization and antimicrobial evaluation of the new compounds is described. In contrast to bicyclomycin itself, the new derivatives 48 and 58 are also active against Proteus species. Otherwise, the antibacterial potency of the bicyclomycin molecule was found to be very sensitive to structural changes.
