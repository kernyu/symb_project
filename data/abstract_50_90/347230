Sensitivity tests were performed on 332 consecutive isolates of Candida albicans. All isolates were inhibited by 0.5 microgram/ml of amphotericin B, and 6.4 microgram/ml of nystatin; and 92.5% of strains were inhibited by 25 microgram/ml of 5-fluorocytosine. Therefore, all three drugs may be employed clinically in the treatment of candidiasis with a reasonable chance of success.
