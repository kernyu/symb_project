In vitro sensitivity tests indicated econazole to be the best drug against all 30 isolates of Trichophyton species followed by miconazole, clotrimazole and tolnaftate. Econazole inhibited the growth of all isolates of Trichophyton species in low concentrations of 2-4 micrograms/ml except one isolate of T. rubrum which was inhibited by a concentration of 8 micrograms/ml. Miconazole was also able to inhibit growth of 73.3 per cent isolates of Trichophyton species in low concentrations of 2-4 micrograms/ml. On the other hand, only 13.3 per cent isolates were found sensitive at 2-4 micrograms/ml concentration to tolnaftate and clotrimazole. Relative resistance was encountered by 7 isolates (23.3%) to tolnaftate and 2 isolates (6.6%) to clotrimazole. Isolates of T. tonsurans were resistant to tolnaftate, whereas, the isolate of T. mentagrophytes was sensitive to all the drugs in low concentrations.
