Twelve Capnocytophaga and seven DF-2 strains were tested for their susceptibility to 14 antimicrobial agents using an agar dilution and an agar diffusion method. Twenty-three other antibiotics were evaluated using the diffusion test only. All strains were fully susceptible to penicillin, ampicillin, cefuroxime, cefotaxime, erythromycin, clindamycin, chloramphenicol, doxycycline, rifamycin and ofloxacin using both methods. Clindamycin, rifamycin and cefotaxime were most active. Using agar dilution some strains were susceptible to gentamicin, but agar diffusion showed total resistance. One Capnocytophaga strain was susceptible and another moderately susceptible to metronidazole, other strains were resistant. The agar diffusion test showed that both Capnocytophaga and DF-2 were resistant to most other aminoglycosides, to fosfomycin, polymyxin and trimethoprim. All strains of both taxa were fully susceptible to piperacillin, cefoxitin, imipenem and fusidic acid and showed different susceptibilities to the other agents. Susceptibility testing by means of agar diffusion using an enriched chocolate agar and 5% CO2 atmosphere could be used to test Capnocytophaga and DF-2 strains and gives sufficient accuracy for routine use, when revised inhibition zone breakpoints are employed.
