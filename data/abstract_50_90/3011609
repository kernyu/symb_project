The cml gene of plasmid R26 is carried on a 1.9-kb HindIII fragment and specifies low-level, inducible resistance to chloramphenicol (Cm). In this paper we report the identification of its product as an approx. 31 kDa protein in minicell experiments, and the determination of the nucleotide sequence of cml, which indicates that the gene product is a relatively hydrophobic protein of Mr 33,800. The protein has no detectable homology to other characterised chloramphenicol-resistance (CmR) proteins, nor any to the membrane-associated tetracycline-resistance (TcR) proteins. The presumptive ribosome-binding site (RBS) of cml mRNA is within a region showing potential for secondary structure.
