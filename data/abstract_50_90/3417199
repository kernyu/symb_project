Levamisole, a common anthelminthic preparation, was used for the modification of the immune response of mice to vaccination with soluble antigen from Taenia crassiceps. The combination of antigen with Levamisole significantly increased the immunogenic effect of the antigen. Metacestodes survived in 16.7% after one dose and in 42.9% after two doses of Levamisole. The percentage of resistance was 97.7% and 67.8%.
