Sensitivity to antibacterial drugs of 510 strains of Shigella Newcastle isolated from both sporadic patients and cases during the disease outbreaks was studied. The studies revealed a rather high percentage of Shigella Newcastle resistant to the antibiotics widely used in clinical practice. Most of the strains, i.e. 90.5 per cent were resistant to tetracycline and a significant number of the isolates, i.e. 55.6--53.3 per cent were resistant to streptomycin and erythromycin. A statistically reliable predominance of the Shigella resistant to levomycetin and streptomycin in the disease foci was noted as compared to the Shigella isolated from the sporadic patients. Most of the isolates were simultaneously resistant to several antibiotics. Thus, resistance to 2,3--4 and 5--6 antibiotics was found in 28, 54.3 and I.I per cent of the cultures respectively. At the same time almost all Shigella Newcastle strains were sensitive to rifampicin, neomycin and monomycin (aminoglycoside antibiotics), enteroseptol (oxychinoline drug) and furazolidone (nitrofuran drug).
