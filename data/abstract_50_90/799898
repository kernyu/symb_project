Phage PE5, responsible for the conversion of type V antigen in Shigella flexneri, has the ability to produce generalized transduction. The correlation between phage multiplicity and the number of transductants, the specific inhibitory activity of anti-PE5 serum, and the lack of transduction in PE5 resistant recipients, indicate the role of phage PE5 in generalized transduction. Transduction of the R100-1 factor resulted in a non-transmissible tetracycline resistance segragation. The characteristics of the tetracycline resistance determinant suggest the possibility of integration.
