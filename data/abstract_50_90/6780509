Resistance to the macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B (MLS) group of antibiotics is widespread and of clinical importance. B. Weisblum and his coworkers have demonstrated that this resistance is associated with methylation of the 23S ribosomal ribonucleic acid of the large ribosomal subunit which results in a diminished affinity of this organelle for these antibiotics (Lai et al, J. Mol. Biol. 74:67-72, 1973). We report that 10 of 15 natural isolates of Bacillus licheniformis, a common soil organism, are resistant to the MLS antibiotics. The properties of this resistance (high level of tolerance for erythromycin, broad cross-resistance spectrum, and inducibility) suggest that resistance is conferred as described above. The resistance determinant from one of these strains was cloned onto a B. subtilis plasmid vector, and the resulting hybrid plasmid (pBD90) was used to prepare radioactive probe deoxyribonucleic acid for hybridization studies. All of the resistance B. licheniformis strains studied exhibited homology with the pBD90 insert. Plasmid pBD90 showed no homology to the following staphylococcal and streptococcal MLS-resistance plasmids: pE194, pE5, pAM77, pI258. Plasmids pE194 and pE5, on the other hand, carry homologous MLS genes but showed no detectable homology to one another in their replication genes. pBD90 specified a 35,000-dalton erythromycin-inducible protein, detectable in minicells, which therefore appears different from the 29,000-dalton inducible resistance protein specified by pE194. We conclude that there are at least three distinct MLS resistance determinants to be found among gram-positive bacteria.
