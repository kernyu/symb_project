Killing curves were used to characterize Staphylococcus haemolyticus isolates previously reported to contain subpopulations showing increased resistance to vancomycin. Results suggested that vancomycin and teicoplanin were ineffective at a concentration of 8 micrograms/ml and growth was seen between 24 and 48 h. Conversely, the lipopeptide antibiotic daptomycin at the same concentration rapidly killed tested strains by 6 h. Various staphylococcal strains were examined to determine if vancomycin resistance could be selected in all strains of staphylococci, was specie(s) restricted, or was unique to this patient's clinical isolates. About 1 x 10(8) colony-forming units were added to melted brain-heart infusion agar plates containing 12 micrograms/ml of vancomycin. Plates were examined after 48 h for presence of resistant clones. Results indicated that selection for vancomycin resistance was restricted to S. haemolyticus strains. Further, all S. haemolyticus isolates that displayed a double zone of growth around imipenem agar diffusion discs (Impdz) contained stably resistant subpopulations. Vancomycin resistance could not be selected in imipenem-sensitive derivative clones. Impdz isolates that were recovered from geographically distinct locations displayed nearly identical SDS-PAGE protein profiles. It appears that a characteristic susceptibility pattern displayed by clinical isolates of S. haemolyticus may provide a marker for those strains that contain subpopulations having increased resistance to vancomycin.
