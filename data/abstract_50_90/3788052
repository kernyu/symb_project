Fourteen isolates of yersiniae belonging to three species isolated from cattle and pigs were tested for their sensitivity to 12 antimicrobial agents by the tube dilution technique. All the isolates were sensitive to gentamicin and 93.0%, 93.0%, 85.7% and 85.7% sensitive to tetracycline, nitrofurantoin, chloramphenicol and sulphamethoxazole-trimethoprim, respectively. There were no consistent differences in the rates and patterns of resistance based on source, species and serotypes of organisms.
