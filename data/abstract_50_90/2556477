Cytochrome b558, an essential component of the respiratory burst of phagocytic cells, is the terminal electron donor to molecular oxygen that results in the formation of superoxide anion (O2-.). It is an integral membrane heterodimer that in neutrophils consists of a 22-kDa small subunit and a highly glycosylated 91-kDa large subunit. Identical core proteins often differ in glycosylation in different cell types and with some membrane glycoproteins, the glycosylation state may markedly affect function. In the present study, antisera reactive with cytochrome b558 large subunit was used for immunoblot analysis of the glycosylation pattern of this subunit from different types of phagocytic cells. Striking variability in the apparent m.w. of this broadly banding subunit was detected in five different phagocytic cell types (neutrophils 78,000 to 93,000; eosinophils 74,000 to 115,000; monocytes 82,000 to 99,000; dibutyryl cyclic AMP-induced HL-60 cells 79,000 to 103,000; dimethyl sulfoxide-induced HL-60 cells 77,000 to 110,000). However, after complete cleavage of N-linked oligosaccharides with endoglycosidase F, the core peptide of cytochrome b558 large subunit from these different cell types had the same Mr (58,000). Inhibition of N-glycosylation with tunicamycin in differentiating HL-60 cells resulted in the synthesis of immunoreactive protein of the same m.w. and banding pattern as seen after endoglycosidase F cleavage. These tunicamycin treated cells retained some capacity to generate superoxide anion when stimulated with PMA. We conclude that the identity of the N-linked oligosaccharides of the cytochrome b558 large subunit differ in various phagocytic cells. All N-linked glycans on cytochrome b558 in all cell types examined were of the complex type as defined by resistance to endoglycosidase H cleavage. N-linked glycosylation of the cytochrome b558 large subunit may not be essential for activation of the respiratory burst.
