UNLABELLED: The patient we report here is a 71 year-old female. After hospitalization, she had clouding of consciousness as an accompanying symptom of DIC (disseminated intravascular coagulation) complicated by septicemia. Her clouding of consciousness caused aspiration pneumonia which developed into pulmonary abscess. Furthermore, she had a large decubital ulcer on the gluteal region. Sputum cultures revealed P. aeruginosa, Serratia and Klebsiella and those from decubital pus grew Proteus, showing to be a mixed infection due to Gram-negative bacilli which brings on medical discussion at present. To the patient, repeated intramuscular AMK was administered at a daily dose of 200 mg ( DURATION: 124 days, Total amount: 24,800 mg). Chest X-P showed a marked improvement. Similarly, the large decubital ulcer was improved. No side-effects were observed in the kidney and eighth nerve though she was a patient with the advanced age of 71. It is thought, therefore, that patients can tolerate long-term treatment with AMK.
