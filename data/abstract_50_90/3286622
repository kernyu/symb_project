We have found that Saccharomyces cerevisiae acquires spontaneously increasing resistance to 2-deoxyglucose at a very high frequency. This finding allows the easy isolation of different types of resistant strains of interest for metabolic studies with 2-deoxyhexoses. On the other hand, it sounds a note of caution in the widespread use of 2-deoxyglucose as a selective agent for the isolation of yeast mutants with impaired hexose transport or phosphorylation systems.
