Basic and clinical evaluations of a new oral cephalosporin cefroxadine (CXD) in pediatric fields were investigated, and the following results were obtained. 1. MICs of CXD against various bacteria were compared with those of cephalexin (CEX). MIC peaks of CXD against clinically isolated S. aureus (22 strains), S. pyogenes (25), S. pneumoniae (8), H. influenzae (23), and E. coli (23) in pediatric fields, were 1.56, 0.2, 1.56, 25 approximately 50 and 6 .25 microgram/ml, respectively in the inoculum size of 10(8) cells/ml, and they were 1.56, less than 0.1, 0.78, 25 and 6.25 microgram/ml respectively in the inoculum size of 10(6) cells/ml. In comparison with CEX, MIC peaks of CXD against S. aureus, S. pyogenes, H. influenzae and E. coli were almost the same with those of the former, it was, however, better by 1 approximately 2 tubes than that of CEX against S. pneumoniae. 2. CXD in the form of dry syrup was administered orally at a dose of either 10 mg/kg or 20 mg/kg to 5 children, and the serum levels and the urinary excretion were evaluated. In the case of 3 children who were administered a dose of 10 mg/kg the mean serum levels were 11.9 microgram/ml after 30 minutes, 13.7 microgram/ml after 1 hour, 4.7 microgram/ml after 2 hours, 0.7 microgram/ml after 4 hours, and 0.3 microgram/ml after 6 hours, while those 2 children who were administered a dose of 20 mg/kg, they were 15.1, 28.5, 12.5, 2.0 and 0.9 microgram/ml respectively. The mean periods of half-life in serum were 0.87 hour in the case of 10 mg/kg and 0.94 hour in the case of 20 mg/kg. The mean excretion rates were 83.8% in the case of 10 mg/kg and 59.8% in the case 20 mg/kg. 3. CXD dry syrup was administered to 31 children with various bacterial infections i.e. acute pharyngitis (15 cases), acute purulent tonsillitis (10 cases), acute bronchitis (4 cases) and 1 case each of acute pyelonephritis and acute purulent cervical lymphadenitis, and the clinical and bacteriological responses and side effect were investigated. The clinical response was either excellent or good in all of the cases. Out of the S. pyogenes (20 strains), S. aureus (1), S. pneumoniae (2), E. coli (1) and H. influenzae (1), bacteriological eradication was observed in all strains with the exception of 1 strain each in S. pyogenes and H. influenzae in which reduction was observed. No side effects and abnormal laboratory findings were observed.
