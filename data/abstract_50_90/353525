The mini plasmids deriving from pKN102, a copy mutant of the antibiotic resistance factor R1drd-19 of E. coli, share a common DNA sequence of 2.6 kb, which carries the minimal functions for autonomous replication. By cloning of two PstI fragments of this region it could be demonstrated that the "basic replicon" is a DNA segment not larger than 1.8 kb, which carries the orgin of replication and the genetic information for at least two proteins. Protein F (NW=11.000 dalton) seems to be synthesed in larger amounts in minicells of E. coli than protein C (20.000). Plasmids containing this isolated replicon of R1 are completely compatible with the parental plasmid R1drd-19.
