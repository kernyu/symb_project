Analogues of the cloning vectors pUC8, pUC9, pEMBL8 +/- and pEMBL9 +/- that have kanamycin resistance (KmR) instead of ampicillin resistance (ApR) as the selectable marker have been developed. HindIII and SmaI sites within the KmR gene have been removed so that all of the cloning sites in the multi-linker region of these plasmids may be used except the AccI site.
