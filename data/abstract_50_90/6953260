Cefotetan (CTT) is a new parenteral semisynthetic cephamycin-type antibiotic with a broad antibacterial spectrum against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Against wide varieties of Gram-negative bacteria, particularly including indole positive Proteus, S. marcescens, Enterobacter sp. and C. freundii CTT was more highly active than cefmetazole, cefoxitin and cefazolin. The 50% inhibition doses (ID50) of CTT against E. coli, K. pneumoniae, P. mirabilis, indole positive Proteus and S. marcescens were by far superior to those of the 3 other antibiotics. The antibacterial activities of CTT were bactericidal and were little affected by addition of horse serum and by variation in pH of the medium, in inoculum size and in type of culture media. Model infections in mice against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria were studied. The therapeutic effects after subcutaneous injection of CTT against various Gram-negative bacterial infections were superior to those of cefmetazole, cefoxitin and cefazolin.
