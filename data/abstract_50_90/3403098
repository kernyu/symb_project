Concentration of gentamicin and tobramycin in sera and renal tissue was determined. Though between the 2nd and 6th day of the treatment, gentamicin cumulated in the renal tissue, but it did not reach toxic value. Tobramycin did not show cumulation tendency. According to in vitro bacterium sensitivity studies, the wide scale use of tobramycin in the clinical practice caused the sudden increase of resistance. To avoid this, the rules of antibiotic treatment should be observed.
