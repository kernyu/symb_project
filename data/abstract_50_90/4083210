Norfloxacin (NFLX) was administered to outpatients and inpatients with urinary tract infections at our department. Clinical efficacy and safety were evaluated in 50 patients by the criteria for evaluation of clinical efficacy of antimicrobial agents on urinary tract infection. Overall clinical efficacy for 17 cases with acute simple cystitis was excellent in 13 cases, moderate in 4 cases with an effectiveness rate of 100%. The overall clinical efficacy for 33 cases with chronic complicated UTI was excellent in 18 cases, moderate in 6 cases and poor in 9 cases with an effectiveness rate of 73%. The eradication rate of 21 strains from acute simple cystitis patients was 100%. Forty four out of 60 strains from chronic complicated UTI patients were eradicated and the eradication rate was 73%. Neither subjective nor objective adverse reactions were observed in 50 patients. Abnormal changes in laboratory tests were found in 8 patients, but were probably not related to NFLX administration. Judging from these results, NFLX is considered to be an effective and safe antibacterial for the treatment of UTI.
