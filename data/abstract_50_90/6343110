Two different diets for the host and three drug dosage regimens were used to select lines resistant to sulfadoxine and pyrimethamine from the parent strain of the rodent malaria parasite Plasmodium berghei [the N (K173) strain]. A higher yield of resistance was obtained when a high parasitemia was present at the beginning of the drug pressure schedule. The development of resistance to the association of sulfadoxine plus pyrimethamine was accelerated by a relatively high para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) content diet. Reproducibility was satisfactory when one of the dosage regimens was applied independently by two different technicians at different times.
