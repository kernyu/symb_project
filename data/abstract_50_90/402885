The antibacterial activity of rifampicin was studied in comparison with other antibiotics with respect to clinical strains isolated from cases with various purulent inflammatory processes caused by Staphylococcus, E. coli, Ps. aeruginose, Proteus. The aim of the study was to define the role of rifampicin in the treatment of the above infections. No rifampicin resistant strains were found among staphylococci belonging to the phenotype carrying the determinants of resistance to 2-8 antibiotics. Rifampicin was less active against gramnegative organisms. High heterogeneity of the microbial population of rifampicin was shown with respect to all microbial strains tested. The rate of the spontaneous mutants was high. The average rate of the mutants was 1-7.7-10-8. The studies on the dynamics of the rifampicin resistance increase in the strains of Staphylococci, E. Coli, Ps. aeruginosa and Proteus showed that the resistance increased after 1-2 passages, which means that one-stage mutation was characteristic rifampicin.
