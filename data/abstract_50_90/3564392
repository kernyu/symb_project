The results of the investigation of 98124 samples of food products for pathogenic and opportunistic bacteria are presented. Among them there were 39711 meat, 4441 fish, 51240 milk and 2732 vegetable and fruit samples. Pathogenic bacteria were isolated in 2.93% samples, opportunistic bacteria in 5.6%. The opportunistic bacteria isolated from food products possessed multiple drug resistance which was determined by R-plasmids in 65.6%. The authors claim that the criteria should be elaborated for the estimation of epidemic hazard values of the opportunistic bacteria content in food products.
