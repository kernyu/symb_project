Sixty-two strains of Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci, 21 Streptococcus faecalis and 17 other strains of streptococci isolated from cases of endocarditis were tested for sensitivity against rifampicin, teicoplanin, vancomycin, fusidic acid, erythromycin and novobiocin. Only rifampicin, novobiocin and teicoplanin were found to be active against the great majority of these strains. The microbial properties of these antibiotics suggest the necessity of combinations for effective therapy. The combinations rifampicin + novobiocin and rifampicin + teicoplanin were additive and suppressed the emergence of resistant mutants. Thus according to in vitro tests, either of these two combinations would be suitable for prophylactic use in high-risk patients, especially those scheduled to receive prosthetic implants.
