We describe an AIDS patient who had a recurrence of Pseudomonas meningitis to illustrate three points. First, the use of sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim in AIDS patients for prophylaxis of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia may cause the various body sites to be colonized with resistant species such as P aeruginosa. Second, Pseudomonas meningitis can recur in a patient with AIDS after a month of appropriate therapy. Finally, imipenem is a poor choice for Pseudomonas meningitis, even when alternative therapies appear much less attractive. High doses of imipenem should not be used for fear of seizures, and lower doses only produce resistant organisms in the CSF.
