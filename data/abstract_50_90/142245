With the growth of international travel, exotic diseases have assumed increasing importance to the physician. They can be effectively prevented by the use of commonsense measures. The physician should be prepared to offer advice on food, drink, and use of prophylactid drugs and to give needed immunizations to patients planning to travel. The biggest pitfall in diagnosis of exotic disease is failure to connect a history of travel with the signs and symptoms. An answer to the simple question, "Where have you been?" should arouse suspicion of the correct diagnosis.
