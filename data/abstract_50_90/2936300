One hundred clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant (Metr) Staphylococcus aureus from five different geographical origins were tested for their susceptibility to 12 non-beta-lactam antibiotics by the broth microdilution technique recommended by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards. Coumermycin and rifampin showed the highest activity with of MIC90s of 0.032 micrograms/ml for each compound. No resistance was found to coumermycin, whereas a single Metr S. aureus strain was found to be resistant to rifampin. Ciprofloxacin, vancomycin, and teicoplanin were the next most active compounds with MIC90s of 0.25, 0.5, and 0.5 micrograms/ml, respectively. Norfloxacin was less active, with an MIC90 of 1.0 micrograms/ml. Amikacin was the most active aminoglycoside tested, whereas high levels of resistance were found to tobramycin and gentamicin. Doxycycline and chloramphenicol showed variable results. Geographical variations in results were seen with doxycycline, chloramphenicol, and aminoglycosides. Kill-curve studies showed that coumermycin, ciprofloxacin, teicoplanin, vancomycin, and rifampin were highly bactericidal; more than 90% of the inoculum was killed within 8 h.
