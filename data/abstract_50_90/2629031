Potassium penicillin G was administered intravenously 4 times daily in doses of 6 million u for 10 days to 49 patients, 36 with central nervous system syphilis and 13 with latent seroresistant syphilis. Forty six patients were followed up after treatment. In 16 patients with central nervous system syphilis treated by this method another cerebrospinal fluid examination was done. Cerebrospinal fluid changes regressed completely in 13 patients, in three cases the improvement was incomplete. The titres of VDRL and FTA tests decreased in 23 patients with central nervous system syphilis and in 11 with latent seroresistant syphilis. In eight patients treated by this method seroresistance persisted and in four cases the titre fluctuated. The results of the study demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the treatment of central nervous system syphilis and latent seroresistant syphilis with crystalline penicillin administered intravenously.
