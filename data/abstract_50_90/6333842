Authors present three cases of ampicillin and chloramphenicol resistant Haemophilus influenzae type b meningitis, and one case with resistance to ampicillin and allergy to chloramphenicol. These multiresistant Haemophilus influenzae strains create very important therapeutic problems. They have used first (cefacetrile), second (cefamandole) and third (cefotaxime an moxalactam) generation cephalosporins, in order to their disponibility. There was an excellent evolution in every case. They conclude that third generation cephalosporins are useful in cases of ampicillin and chloramphenicol resistant Haemophilus influenzae type b meningitis.
