Sensitivity of 129 strains of pathogenic staphylococci isolated from patients with pneumonia was studied with respect to a large number of drugs in the Bacteriological Laboratory of Konstantiny in the Algerian People's Democratic Republic. The method of paper discs and the Muller-Hinton solid nutrient medium were used. The staphylococcal strains were highly sensitive to cephalosporins, some of aminoglycosides (neomycin, gentamicin, tobramycin), nitrofurans, rifampicin, some antibiotics of other groups. Minocycline proved to be the most active among the tetracycline antibiotics. The number of the strains sensitive to it amounted to 82 per cent. 74--76 per cent of the isolates were resistant to tetracycline and oxytetracycline. 40--77 per cent of the isolates were resistant to sulfanilamides.
