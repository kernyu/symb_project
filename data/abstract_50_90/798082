The author proposes a new method of treatment for chromoblastomycosis, using the association of two drugs of confirmed therapeutic activity: amphotericin B and 5-fluorocytosine. The aim was to obtain a synergistic action against the causative fungus. The method consists of the following: 50 mg. of amphotericin B is injected i.v. every other day --three times a week-- for three months. Total dosis: 36 ampoules. 5-fluorocytosine is simultaneously given orally --6 tablets of 500 mg. a day-- for three months in a total dosis of 540 tablets or 270 g. Seventeen patients were treated in this way up to now. Six interrupted the treatment on account of several reasons unrelated to treatment. The other 11 that completed this schedule, obtained clinical and histological cure. All were followed-up. No evidence of relapse was seen, even after 27 months of control. The safety of this method of treatment was demonstrated by the low incidence of side effects as inappetence, lassitude, nausea and weight loss. In these circumstances the discontinuance of the drugs for some days was sufficient to resume the treatment. Apparently this therapeutic schedule is the most effective up to now. It has the advantage of not causing resistance and by utilizing low concentrations of the drugs, protecting the patient against risks of toxicity.
