The cholera toxin operon (ctxAB) is located on a 7-kilobase pair variable genetic element which undergoes genetic duplication and amplification events in Vibrio cholerae. Amplification of the ctx genetic element was investigated by substituting the resident ctx loci of two V. cholerae strains with a DNA fragment encoding resistance to kanamycin. Although these strains were not normally resistant to greater than 150 micrograms of kanamycin per ml, spontaneous derivatives could be obtained that grew well on 3 mg of kanamycin per ml. Southern blot analysis of these highly resistant isolates demonstrated that the ctx element was amplified approximately 20-fold. This amplification process was completely inhibited in the absence of a functional recA gene. The V. cholerae RecA protein, therefore, is essential for cholera toxin gene amplification. Spontaneous deletions of the ctx structural genes were observed in both recA+ and recA- V. cholerae strains, although such deletions occurred at a 21-fold-lower frequency in the latter case. Structural analysis of these ctx amplification and deletion events supports a model for their formation that involves unequal crossing over between repetitive sequences located upstream and downstream of the ctx operon.
