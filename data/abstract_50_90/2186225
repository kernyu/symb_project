The present study investigated the sensitivity of 35 group A beta-hemolytic streptococci strains, isolated from clinical samples in 1988 and 1989, to 12 antibiotics. The minimal inhibitory concentrations of each antibiotic were measured by the agar dilution method. All strains were sensitive to penicillin G, ampicillin, oxacillin, cefazolin, cefotaxime, erythromycin, clindamycin, vancomycin and ciprofloxacin. It was concluded that, in our area, Streptococcus pyogenes still has an excellent sensitivity to penicillin G and to other antibiotics which may be a therapeutic alternative in allergic patients or an empiric treatment in infections likely to be produced, among other organisms, by S. pyogenes.
