We referred on 219 Candida strains isolated, during the last year, from 1084 vaginal smears and identified by a rapid slide agglutination test. Moreover, we analyze our preliminary data of the activity test with antifungal drugs on 75 Candida strains. At last we suggest a larger routine application of these methods for a correct treatment of vaginal Candidosis.
