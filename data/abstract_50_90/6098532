A novel system for selection and maintenance of cells carrying a recombinant plasmid has been developed, using the streptomycin-dependent (Smd) Escherichia coli 4D host and a plasmid vector carrying an rpsL gene from an Sm-resistant (Smr) mutant of E. coli which masks the Smd phenotype. Strain 4D carrying the Smr pBR322 plasmid can grow without Sm. Using this host-vector system, we can select for cells carrying an Smr recombinant plasmid and maintain them in antibiotic-free media.
