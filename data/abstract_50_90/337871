The goal of this work is to describe the evolution of bacteria resistant to antibiotics in an aquatic environment and to compare their importance at different stages: human flora, sewage, surface water. Coliforms, fecal coliforms and Aeromonas are selected at test bacteria. The incidence of this difussion and influencing factors are discussed.
