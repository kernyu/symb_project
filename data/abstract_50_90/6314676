The effect of chemical inhibitors on reproduction of 2 laboratory and 3 vaccine strains of herpes simplex virus (HSV), types 1 and 2, was studied. By the time of the study the vaccine strains had undergone from 27 to 69 passages in chick embryo fibroblast cultures. All the vaccine strains (L2, Us, and VN) exhibited 100-1000 fold higher resistance to phosphonoacetic acid than did the laboratory F+ and G strains, and the vaccine L2 strain (HSV-1) was also 1000-fold resistant to 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosine thymine.
