An in vitro study of the sensitivity of three cephalosporins of the third generation was performed on 119 wild strains of enterobacteriae selected because of their resistance to cefalotine and cefoxitine. Cefotaxime, latamoxef and cetriaxone remain very active on such strains since almost all of the strains were inhibited by a dose of 4 micrograms/ml and CI 50 p. cent was below 0.20 micrograms/ml. The activity of these three cephalosporins was comparable on groups E. coli, Klebsiella-Enterobacter-Serratia and C. freudii. Ceftriaxone appeared clearly more active than latamoxef and cefotaxime on Proteus stains.
