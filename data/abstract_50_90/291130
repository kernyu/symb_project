Hybrid cells produced by the fusion of pairs of cells, one a tumorigenic derivative of CHEF/16 and the other a nontumorigenic derivative of CHEF/18, give rise to clones which are largely tetraploid, but rare reduced hybrids with chromosome counts in the diploid range have been recovered from tumors of hybrid origin. This paper describes the recovery in cell culture of reduced hybrids in the diploid range by selection with 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) or methylcellulose as well as by growth in culture of cells from excised tumors. All selected subclones were tumorigenic and resistant to BrdU, but they segregated for resistance to 6-thioguanine. Unselected subclones were tetraploid, nontumorigenic, and sensitive to both drugs. These data show that chromosome reassortment as well as extensive chromosome reduction both occur in a small fraction of the population during growth of each hybrid clone.
