In a staphylococcosis epidemic occurring in a child community, the proportion of inducible lincomycin resistance has risen significantly in the bacterium population. This conveyed the possibility that lincomycin or its derivatives may induce a lincomycin resistance in Staphylococcus aureus as it is already known in streptococci. Examination of human and animal samples obtained during lincomycin treatment showed that lincomycin had no role in the induction of resistance; the agent can effectively be applied against pathogens of the above-mentioned phenotype. Immunological examination of serum samples provided opportunity for a more exact localization of the protein-linkage of lincomycin.
