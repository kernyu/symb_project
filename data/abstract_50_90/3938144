It was possible to isolate a strain of Serratia marcescens from fresh clinical bacterial isolates which was 4-6 times more resistant against formaldehyde than other strains. It was shown that the strain harbours two plasmids with molecular sizes of 58- and 90 Mdal. It was demonstrated by conjugation-, transformation- and plasmid-curing experiments that the formaldehyderesistance is plasmid mediated and transferable to E. coli. It was shown by labelling with 14C-formaldehyde that the resistant strains bind much more formaldehyde than the sensible strains.
