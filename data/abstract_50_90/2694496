The susceptibilities of 27 Plasmodium falciparum strains to chloroquine and mefloquine were studied in the area of Puerto Ayacucho, Amazonas Federal Territory of Venezuela, to determine their levels of resistance in vivo and in vitro. 50% of these strains showed chloroquine resistance in vivo. No grade III chloroquine resistance was found. 25% of the strains were resistant to chloroquine in vitro and 9% were resistant to mefloquine in vitro. Preliminary results suggest that strains resistant to Fansidar may also be found.
