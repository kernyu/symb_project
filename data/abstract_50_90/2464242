Regularities of endogenous interferon (IFN) induction with Newcastle disease virus (NDV) in rats and the effect of this process of the resistance of mast cells to the degranulating effect of immune complexes are described. Increased resistance of mast cells to the damaging effect of immune complexes for 72 hours after a single induction of endogenous IFN with virus was demonstrated in experiments in vivo. Inoculation of rats with NDV treated at pH = 2.0 did not induce the production of endogenous IFN, and the mast cells from these animals underwent degranulation to the same extent as those from intact animals. Protection of mast cells by IFN from the degranulating effect of immune complexes was also demonstrated in in vitro experiments.
