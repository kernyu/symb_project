In a bacteriologic and clinical assessment of nalidixic acid (NegGram), 95% of Gramnegative urinary pathogens tested in vitro (with the exception of Pseudomonas pyocyanea) were sensitive to therapeutically attainable levels. The antibacterial spectrum of this agent was surpassed only by parenteral kanamycin, which is potentially ototoxic. Of 70 patients treated with 0.5-1.0 g. every six hours for from two weeks to two months, 61 underwent a full course of treatment and could be assessed. In 42 the infection cleared up, in 15 the original organism disappeared and a new resistant organism emerged, and in four the original organisms became resistant. These four were treated with 0.5 g. every six hours, which suggests that the higher dose may be necessary to prevent development of resistance. In only three of 13 patients with nausea did the drug have to be discontinued. Two patients developed drug rashes and one diarrhea. The drug is a valuable addition to the therapeutic agents used for urinary infections.
