Sherman propionic acid bacilli were sensitive to benzylpenicillin, ampicillin, ceporin, tetracyclines, oleandomycin, oletetrin, tetraolean, sigmamycin, levomycetin and furadonine. Methicillin, oxacillin, monomycin, kanamycin, polymyxin and furazolidone had an insignificant effect on the above organism. The subbacteriostatic concentrations of methicillin, oxacillin, streptomycin, monomycin, kanamycin, neomycin, tetraolean, sigmamycin, polymyxin M and ristomycin increased the biosynthesis of vitamin B12 by Sherman propionic acid bacilli, while benzylpenicillin, ampicillin, tetracyclines, oleandomycin, oletetrin, levomycetin and furadonine in the subbacteriostatic concentrations inhibited this process.
