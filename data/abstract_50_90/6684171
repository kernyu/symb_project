Plasma membranes in intermediate junctions of ependymal cells are found to show considerable resistance to the antibiotic filipin, suggesting low cholesterol in these membranes. Further, ependymal cells were treated with cytochalasin B (CB) infused into the cerebral ventricle in vivo, and then incubated with filipin. When treated with CB, intermediate junctions show a decrease in their underlying density, mainly composed of microfilaments, and their membranes are found to be more affected by filipin. This reduction of resistance to the antibiotic is clearly demonstrated by thin-section and freeze-fracture as well as quantitative analysis. Nonjunctional lateral membranes, however, show no significant difference in the degree of filipin effect whether treated with CB or not. Although biochemical data on lipid composition have not been available for the intermediate junction membranes, we bring forward a possibility that resistance to filipin in these membranes may come not from less cholesterol but from morphological membrane stability brought about by the filamentous underlying.
