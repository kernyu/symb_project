Avermectin B1a concentrations corresponding to the KD value of a specific high affinity binding site for [3H]avermectin B1a are sufficient to stimulate the specific high affinity binding of [3H]flunitrazepam to its receptors. This stimulation of [3H]flunitrazepam binding by low concentrations of avermectin B1a was enhanced by chloride ions and picrotoxinin and reduced by the GABA agonists THIP and PSA. The similar modulation by chloride ions, GABA agonists and picrotoxinin and the resistance against washing of membranes of avermectin B1a bound to its specific high affinity binding site or to the site modulating [3H]flunitrazepam binding indicate a close association of the specific high affinity binding site for [3H]avermectin B1a with the GABA-benzodiazepine receptor complex.
