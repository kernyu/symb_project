In vitro study on antibacterial activity of amikacin in comparison to that of streptomycin revealed a high sensitivity of tularemia microbes of three geographical races to it. Amikacin showed a high therapeutic activity in treatment of albino mice infected with tularemia. The prospects of amikacin use in prophylaxis and treatment of tularemia are defined by its antibiotic activity against streptomycin-resistant forms of the tularemia causative agent.
