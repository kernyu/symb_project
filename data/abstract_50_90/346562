A screening procedure was developed for identifying mutants of the plasmid pKM101 no longer capable of enhancing mutagenesis. The test was based on the large pKM101-mediated increase in the number of Gal+ papillae observed on colonies of Salmonella typhimurium gal mutants plated on tetrazolium-galactose plates in the presence of a mutagen. The pKM101 mutant plasmids transferred normally, were stably maintained in cells, caused normal levels of ampicillin resistance, and still imparted sensitivity to phage Ike to their hosts. However, the pKM101 mutants had lost the ability to (i) enhance the reversion of both point and frameshift mutations, (ii) protect the cells against killing by UV irradiation, (iii) increase the spontaneous reversion rates of point mutations, (iv) enhance plasmid-mediated reactivation of UV-irradiated phage P22, (v) enhance Weigle reactivation. One pKM101 mutant with different properties from the others was identified by its increased spontaneous mutator effect. It is suggested that pKM101 amplifies the activity of the inducible error-prone repair systems in bacteria and that this is the function of pKM101 in the Ames Salmonella tester strains used for detection of carcinogens as mutagens.
