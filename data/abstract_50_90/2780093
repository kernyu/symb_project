Six antibiotics active on the cell-wall were tested against a methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus P18 strain at the start of exponential growth rate. The concentration was four-fold the MIC determined in a non-hypersaline liquid medium. The peptidoglycan amino-acid content of the various cell wall samples was determined. An antibiotic-free S. aureus P18 and the methicillin-sensitive Cowan I. S. aureus strain were used a controls. Beta lactam antibiotic treatment, oxacillin and cephalothin, induced an increase of alanine content which suggests that only secondary-transpeptidation did not occur. Similar results were obtained using vancomycin. Amino-acid content was not modified by bacitracin, which is in agreement with the results expected. The results obtained for fosfomycin and cefamandole were not easy to interpret.
