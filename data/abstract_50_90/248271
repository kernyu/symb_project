Clinically isolated strains of Staphylococcus aureus that are inducibly resistant to both erythromycin and penicillin were susceptible to a combination of the two antibiotics. The synergistic effect of the combination results from an inhibition of penicillinase induction by erythromycin, sparing penicillin and allowing this drug to inhibit growth. When resistance to erythromycin is constitutive rather than inducible, the combination is no longer synergistic.
