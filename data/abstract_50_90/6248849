Closed circular DNA interacts with complementary sequences of single-stranded DNA to form displacement loop (D loop) structures in vitro. The site of D-loop formation can be directed by using single-stranded DNA derived from a selected restriction fragment. Circular DNA containing a D loop can then be linearized by cleavage with endonuclease S1. This cleavage appears to remove a limited number of nucleotides from each strand of the circular DNA substrate. Incubation with polynucleotide ligase followed by propagation in vivo leads to circular DNA molecules that bear small, single deletions in the region of the single-stranded DNA sequence chosen for the formation of the D loops. We have utilized these manipulations of DNA to construct tetracycline-sensitive deletion mutants of plasmid pBR322. The level of mutagenesis obtained by the procedure is sufficiently high that selective growth and screening procedures are not necessary for the isolation or identification of mutants. The frequency, variety, and small size of the deletions obtained within the selected target regions present considerable advantage for genetic and biochemical analysis. The method is quite general in rationale and should be immediately applicable to phage and viruses having infectious circular DNA genomes or recombinant DNA species propagated in circular plasmid vectors.
