We have previously shown that cycloheximide resistance can be induced in a strain of Candida maltosa by modifying ribosomes (M. Takagi, S. Kawai, Y. Takata, N. Tanaka, M. Sunairi, M. Miyazaki, and K. Yano, J. Gen. Appl. Microbiol. 31:267-275, 1985). The present paper describes the cloning of the gene involved in this resistance (designated RIM-C for ribosome modification by cycloheximide) by using a host-vector system of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
