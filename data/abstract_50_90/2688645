Using chloroquine-sensitive (CS) and chloroquine-resistant (CR) strains of Plasmodium falciparum in vitro, interactions between tetrandrine (TT) and either chloroquine (CQ) or qinghaosu (QHS, artemisinin) were assessed using isobolograms. Sums of the fractional inhibitory concentration for the combination of the two drugs are less than one and therefore, we can conclude that in vitro TT and CQ or QHS act synergistically against CS and CR falciparum malaria. Remarkably, using CR malaria, TT can lower the IC50 dose of CQ as much as 40 fold. These drug combinations may impair the advantage that the development of CQ resistance conveys on the parasite.
