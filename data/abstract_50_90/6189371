The construction and some properties of new hybrid plasmids which are able to replicate in both Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis are presented. A 5.5 Md hybrid plasmid pJP9 was constructed from pBR322 (Tc, Ap) and pUB110 (Nm) plasmids. pIM1 (7.0 Md) and pIM3 (7.7 Md) plasmids are its different erythromycin resistant derivatives. Tetracycline, ampicillin, neomycin and possibly erythromycin resistance genes are expressed in E. coli while neomycin and erythromycin resistance genes are expressed in B. subtilis. Insertional inactivation of only one gene is possible using the pJP9 plasmid as a vector in B. subtilis. However, insertional inactivation of at least two different genes can be achieved and monitored in E. coli and B. subtilis transformants in cloning experiments with PIM1 and pIM3 plasmids. Insertional inactivation of antibiotic resistance genes present in pJP9 plasmid was achieved by cloning of Streptococcus sanguis DNA fragments generated by appropriate restriction endonucleases. The pJP9 plasmid and its derivatives were found to be stable in both hosts cells.
