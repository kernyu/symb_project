Of 103 strains of Haemophilus ducreyi isolated in Johannesburg, 96 produced beta-lactamase and were resistant to penicillin and ampicillin. Most strains showed resistance to tetracycline, sulfisoxazole, and sulfamethoxazole. All isolates were susceptible to rifampin, erythromycin, and cefoxitin, moderately susceptible to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (1:19) and minocycline, and somewhat less susceptible to doxycycline.
