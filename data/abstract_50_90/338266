205 paraplegic inpatients with urinary infections were treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMZ) bladder instillations (160 mg TMP 800 mg SMZ daily for 2 consecutive weeks). 89.3% out of 84 patients with recent vertebral trauma and no history of previous urinary infection (group A), and 68.6% out of 121 patients with paraplegia since more than 2 years, severe chronic infection and various pathological conditions of the urinary tract (group B) were found to be sterile at the end of the trial. The intravesical concentrations of 3.2 mg/ml TMP and 16 mg/ml SMZ which are reached immediately after instillation are 50--100 times superior to the minimal growth-inhibitory concentrations for most sensitive germs as determined with agar dilution tests. Several strains of Klebsiella and Proteus which had previously proved resistant to oral treatment were eliminated with intravesical TMP-SMZ. The incidence of reinfection, evaluated 1 month after interruption of treatment, was particularly high (62.7%) in patients with known involvement of the upper tract of intravesical obstruction with postmicturition residuals above 75 ml. On the other hand, 28% only among the patients with recent spinal injury and integrity of the upper urinary tract became reinfected after the same interval. The absence of local intolerance could be confirmed in all 21 cystoscopically examined patients between the 6th and 11th day of treatment. Hematuria was never encountered. Systemic side effects were noted in 7.8% Serum concentrations of both drug components are being investigated; results will be published elsewhere.
