Patients with diabetes mellitus displayed a suppression of humoral and cellular mechanisms of nonspecific factors of immunity protection: of bacteridical serum activity, of phagocytic neutrophil activity, and a sharp disturbance of profound skin autoflora. The amount of serum lysozyme diminished only in young patients with severe form of diabetes mellitus. In other patients the muramidase content was increased. Compensation of the disease led to an even greater elevation of this enzyme, and produced no significant influence on other natural resistance parameters.
