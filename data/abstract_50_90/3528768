The mechanisms of drug resistance of clinical isolate, Vibrio (V.) parahaemolyticus ST550, resistant to chloramphenicol (CP), aminoglycoside antibiotics (AGs) and beta-lactam antibiotics were investigated. The mechanisms of resistance to CP, AGs and beta-lactam antibiotics were dependent on chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT), aminoglycoside-3"-adenylyltransferase AAD(3") and aminoglycoside-3'-phosphotransferase APH(3') and TEM type penicillinase, respectively.
