The effect of rifampin on five mollicutes (Spiroplasma citri, Spiroplasma melliferum, Spiroplasma apis, Acholeplasma laidlawii, and Mycoplasma mycoides) was compared with that on Escherichia coli. We found that, in contrast to wild-type E. coli, mollicutes were insensitive to rifampin. DNA-dependent RNA polymerases from S. melliferum and S. apis were purified to the stage where the enzymes were dependent on the addition of exogenous templates for activity. The enzymes were then tested for their sensitivity to rifampin. Spiroplasmal enzymes were at least 1,000 times less sensitive to rifampin than the corresponding E. coli enzyme. This result provides a molecular basis for the resistance of mollicutes to rifampin. The RNA polymerase of S. melliferum was further purified and its subunit composition was investigated. The RNA polymerase has one small and two large subunits. The structure of S. melliferum RNA polymerase therefore resembles that of the eubacterial enzymes in spite of its insensitivity to rifampin.
