A mutator strain [AraCr (1.5)4], isolated from mutagenized cultures of multipotent mouse teratocarcinoma cells (embryonal carcinoma stem cells), exhibited a dNTP pool imbalance, with more than a 10-fold relative increase in the intracellular concentration of dCTP. The increase in the spontaneous rate of mutation for 6-thioguanine resistance was 3.6-fold and for ouabain resistance, 7.9-fold. Normalization of the dCTP/dTTP ratio by addition of thymidine and deoxycytidine to the media was associated with normalization of the mutation rates. AraCr (1.5)4 cell retained its multipotency (including chimerization potential) when injected into blastocysts. Moreover, its differentiated progeny expressed the dNTP pool imbalance and mutator phenotype in vitro. The preliminary finding of an increased frequency of morphologically abnormal embryos derived from a series of transplanted blastocysts injected with AraC2 (1.5)4 stem cells is consistent with significant phenotypic effects in vivo.
