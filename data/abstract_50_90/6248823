A second-generation cephalosporin (cephotaxime) with a marked resistance to beta-lactamase, a very broad spectrum, and remarkably low renal toxicity was used to treat 47 patients with respiratory, urinary and other infections. The results were excellent in 89.2% and good in 8.5%. The antibiotic proved effective even against germs that are usually resistant to cephalosporins (Pseudomonas, Proteus, Serratia and Enterobacteriaceae). Bacteriuria disappeared in all cases of urinary infection. Local and general tolerance was excellent in all cases but one. Renal tolerance was also excellent in patients with chronic renal failure, for whom the daily dose can be usefully reduced and a check on renal function should be kept.
