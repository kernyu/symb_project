A new method that involves the use of the cation exchange resin Dowex 50W-X4 to remove non-encapsulated drugs from liposome dispersions was investigated. Cytostatic drugs widely varying in their molecular structure can be removed from aqueous solutions by Dowex 50W-X4. The applicability of the resin to separate free from liposome-bound drugs was illustrated for a number of cytostatic drugs (cisplatin, doxorubicin, vincristine). The technique presented allows for a rapid, efficient and convenient procedure for the free drug removal from liposome dispersions without dilution of the liposomal preparation. Studies with liposome-encapsulated drugs will be facilitated by the use of this method, since it avoids many of the problems introduced by conventional methods as dialysis, gel filtration and centrifugation/washing. To elucidate the interaction mechanism of doxorubicin with Dowex 50W-X4, alternative adsorbents were studied for their doxorubicin binding properties. In the adsorption process of doxorubicin onto Dowex 50W-X4 both electrostatic (ion exchange) and hydrophobic effects play a role. The results indicate that hydrophobic contributions to the interaction are responsible for the high resistance offered by the binding forces against desorption of adsorbed doxorubicin. For other adsorbents the interactions are either mainly of an electrostatic or a hydrophobic nature.
