1. During copper-limited growth of Candida utilis in continuous culture on a non-fermentable carbon and energy source there is a selective pressure favouring the emergence of variants that are less dependent on copper. 2. We describe the properties of such a variant that by-passes cytochrome oxidase (EC 1.9.3.1) by utilizing an alternative oxidase communicating with the respiratory chain at about the level of cytochrome b. 3. Both direct studies of isolated mitochondria and calculations based on growth parameters showed that only one of the normal three phosphorylation sites was active. This site was localized between NADH and the cytochromes. 4. Growth of the variant with copper-supplemented media resulted in the return of cytochrome oxidase but not the loss of the alternative oxidase. 5. The alternative oxidase is inhibited by substituted benzhydroxamic acids. 6. Submitochondrial particles from the variant did not exhibit any novel electron-paramagnetic-resonance-spectroscopy features at about g=2.0 either at 80 degrees K or 12 degrees K.
