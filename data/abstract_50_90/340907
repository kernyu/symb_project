We have studied the in vitro properties of ribosomes from several mutants resistant to erythromycin. Mutations in three different genes may confer resistance to erythromycin. Two of them are structural genes for proteins L4 and L22 of the large subunit. The third mutation (in eryC gene) seems to affect mainly the small subunit. The mechanism of action of the antibiotic may involve both subunits.
