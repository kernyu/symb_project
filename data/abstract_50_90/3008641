Resistance of clinical strains of Enterobacteriaceae to aminoglycoside antibiotics and in particular to gentamicin was studied. The data on conjugation and plasmid DNA transformation of a clinical strain 10171 of E. cloacae, as well as the data on P1 transduction showed that its gentamicin resistance was due to plasmids. The gentamicin resistance determinant was cloned from the plasmid DNA with the use of the restriction sites of EcoR I, Hind III and Pst I into the vector plasmid pUC 19. Plasmids pAA1, pAA2, pAA3 and pAA4 carrying the gmr determinant were isolated. Their physical maps were constructed. The restriction analysis supplemented by the data on DNA-DNA hybridization was indicative of the identical 2.0 kb sequences in all the plasmids carrying the gmr determinant.
