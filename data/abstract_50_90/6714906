Pneumococcal vaccination may be recommended for certain risk groups according to Landesman and Schiffman such as people with heart and pulmonary diseases, sickle cell anemia, condition after splenectomy, M. Hodgkin, multiple myeloma, immune suppression. The vaccination is also indicated in elderly people (above 60 years). 14 oder 17-valent polysaccharide-vaccines are available which are well tolerated although mild side effects are possible. The immunogenicity is good in young as well as elderly people, antibody levels as high as 250-300 ng antibody nitrogen/ml are protective according to Landesman and Schiffman. A field trial performed in elderly people revealed a preferential influence on the case-fatality rate. The vaccination shall not be repeated within 4-5 years because of possible local reactions due to local antigen-antibody union.
