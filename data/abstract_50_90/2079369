In a prospective, open clinical trial 21 patients suffering from lower respiratory tract infections were treated with the new oral cephalosporin cefixime. The antibiotic was given at a dosage of 200 mg b. i. d. for seven to eleven days. Seventeen of 18 evaluable patients were cured or distinctly improved at the end of therapy as well as two days after the end of treatment. Clinical results correlated well with the results of the lung function tests, especially with the significant decrease of resistance. At the end of therapy all initially isolated pathogens were eradicated. The tolerability of cefixime was good, only in two patients treated mild and transient side effects were noticed (1 x diarrhea, 1 x epigastric pain).
