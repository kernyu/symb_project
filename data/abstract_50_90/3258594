The zone sizes and MICs of ampicillin, cefaclor and cephalexin were determined for 2458 clinical isolates of Haemophilus influenzae collected in 1986 during a national survey of the prevalence of resistance in this species. Cefaclor showed greater in-vitro activity than cephalexin against all isolates, with a modal MIC of 4 mg/l compared with 8 mg/l. MIC50 values for the 2201 ampicillin-sensitive and 157 beta-lactamase-positive resistant strains were similar for both cephalosporins (4 mg/l for cefaclor, and 8 mg/l for cephalexin). A further 100 strains with a reduced zone (less than 20 mm) to a 2 micrograms ampicillin disc showed a definite (MIC greater than or equal to 4 mg/l) or intermediate (MIC 1 or 2 mg/l) degree of intrinsic resistance to ampicillin. Both cephalosporins showed a marked and significant rise in MIC values for this group. Cefaclor is the more active agent against ampicillin-sensitive and beta-lactamase-positive H. influenzae but strains with an intrinsic mechanism of resistance to ampicillin are markedly less sensitive to both cefaclor and cephalexin.
