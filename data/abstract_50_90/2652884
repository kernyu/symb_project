A comparative study was carried out of adaptative capacities of microorganisms to antiseptic agents from the group of cationic surface-active substances (SAS) and antibiotics. It was established that antiseptic agents from SAS group may induce the appearance of resistant to them populations of microorganisms. The resistance acquired to one of the surface-active antiseptics spreads to other agents of this group. At the same time, cationic SAS reduce the frequency and rate of appearance of antibiotico-resistant populations of bacteria during combined use with antibiotics.
