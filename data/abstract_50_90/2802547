The therapeutic activities of ciprofloxacin (25 mg/kg every 8 h), rifampin (10 mg/kg every 24 h), ciprofloxacin plus rifampin, and vancomycin (17.5 mg/kg every 6 h) were compared by using the rabbit model of Staphylococcus aureus endocarditis. Animals infected with one of two test strains (SA1199 or SA487) were randomized into treatment groups and received 6 days of therapy. For SA1199, ciprofloxacin plus rifampin was most effective at reducing vegetation bacterial counts. For SA487, ciprofloxacin plus rifampin was as effective as vancomycin but less effective than ciprofloxacin alone. Resistance to ciprofloxacin at 5- and 10-fold the MIC emerged in the test strain in 82 and 55%, respectively, of rabbits infected with SA1199 and receiving ciprofloxacin monotherapy. The combination of ciprofloxacin and rifampin decreased these frequencies to 60% (P = 0.27) and 10% (P = 0.04). No resistance to ciprofloxacin was found in rabbits infected with SA487. We conclude that ciprofloxacin and ciprofloxacin plus rifampin are as efficacious as vancomycin in this model and that combining rifampin with ciprofloxacin may decrease the frequency at which high-level resistance to ciprofloxacin emerges. However, with respect to improved efficacy, the combination of ciprofloxacin and rifampin is unpredictable and may be detrimental.
