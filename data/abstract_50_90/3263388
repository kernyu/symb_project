Disk diffusion interpretive zone size criteria for use with Haemophilus test medium are proposed for five extended-spectrum cephalosporins. With cefuroxime, zones greater than or equal to 24 mm in diameter indicated susceptibility, while zones less than or equal to 20 mm implied resistance. With cefotaxime, ceftizoxime, and ceftriaxone, a single susceptible-zone size, greater than or equal to 26 mm, is proposed.
