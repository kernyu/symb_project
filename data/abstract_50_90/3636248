The clinical efficacy of intravenous Augmentin (a formulation containing amoxycillin plus clavulanic acid) was investigated in an open study in fifty-eight children with a mean age of 6 years (range 1-15 years). The normal dosage was in the range 100-200 mg/kg/day Augmentin, administered parenterally by short i.v. infusion in 3 or 4 divided doses. Most patients were hospitalised for lower respiratory tract infections. Complete clinical cure or distinct clinical improvement was achieved in all assessable cases. Bacteriological success was obtained in 92% of the assessable cases. In two patients, mild, transient exanthema was noted after i.v. Augmentin was replaced by oral Augmentin. No additional therapeutic measures were required.
