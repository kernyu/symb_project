Transmission of M. bovis infection from a 36 year old father, a veterinary assistant, with cavitary lung tuberculosis and repeated demonstration of M. bovis in sputum to his 11 year old daughter is described. The infection manifested itself by a postinfectional allergic tuberculin reaction which was treated preventively with Isoniazid for 6 months. After 10 months a pulmonary primary complex developed with cavitary disintegration and repeated excretion of M. bovis in sputum. In the second case the source of infection was a 56 year old cattle attendant with cavitary lung tuberculosis and repeated excretion of M. bovis. During repeated contacts he infected his 44 year old friend, a bricklayer, whose resistance was reduced due to anemia and liver impairment. His findings showed cavitary lung tuberculosis in the middle lung field. In this case, too, M. bovis in the sputum was repeatedly demonstrated.
