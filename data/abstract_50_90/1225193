Two methods were compared for determination of drug resistant staphylococci on the nasal mucosa of patients, i. e. the routine method for determination of staphylococcal sensitivity to antibiotics and the method of direct plating out of the starting material onto agarized media containing antibiotics. Staphylococci resistant to streptomycin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, monomycin, axacillin and less frequent to penicillin were found more often with the 2nd method. A method of proportions was developed for testing sensitivity of staphylococci in purulent inflammatory foci of the patients. It provided characterization of the staphylococcal population from the foci by the number of the antibiotic resistant microbial cells.
