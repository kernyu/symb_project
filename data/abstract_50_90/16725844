Five isolants of Pseudomonas aeruginosa collected from clinical cases of equine genital infection and one standard strain of P. aeruginosa were exposed to various concentrations of ethylene-diaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and tris (hydroxymethyl) aminomethane (tris buffer pH 8) and EDTA-tris lysozyme. Colony forming units of the isolants and minimal inhibitory concentrations for 11 antimicrobial agents were determined with each isolant before and after exposure to the EDTA solutions. Decreased cellular viability was found with all six isolants after exposure to the EDTA-tris solutions. Reversal of antimicrobial resistance was variable and unpredictable. These effects were not enhanced by the addition of lysozyme. The results suggest that EDTA-tris could be a useful adjunct in treating equine genital infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
