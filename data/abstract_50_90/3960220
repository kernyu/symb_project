Cryptococcal meningitis is a life-threatening disease. Headache, vomiting, cranial nerve symptoms and mental changes are the most common symptoms, but as many as 15% may have no symptoms referable to the CNS. For chemotherapy four drugs are available: namely amphotericin B, 5-fluorocytosine, miconazole and ketoconazole. Most cases have been treated by combination of amphotericin B and 5-fluorocytosine. The intrathecal administration of amphotericin B should be considered for patients who fail to respond to the usual intravenous therapy. The case is reported of a patient who died due to hydrocephalus, and the CSF-levels of the administered drugs are presented. Some pitfalls of therapy are discussed.
