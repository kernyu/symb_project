The is-1 mutant of mengovirus is 100 times more sensitive to interferon (IFN) than wild type, as measured by a yield reduction assay in the G3 line of mouse L cells, and is also much more readily inactivated at pH 2. Neither isolated nor encapsidated RNA is degraded under these conditions, which suggests that the pH-sensitive region resides on the virus coat. One-third of the viruses selected for resistance to low pH also showed enhanced resistance to IFN. Attempts to isolate IFN resistant strains directly from is-1 stocks were unsuccessful. These results suggest that either a capsid protein or its precursor is an active anti-IFN agent.
