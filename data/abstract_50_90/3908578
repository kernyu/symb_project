Mouse foot-pad experiments were carried out to study the effects of DFS and related compounds on the multiplication of M. leprae. Of the 25 cases clinically suspected Dapsone resistance, 8 were found resistant and 14 sensitive to Dapsone by mouse foot-pad experiments. Six were resistant to DFS and 16 were sensitive. Desoxy fructo 5-hydroxy tryptophane as well as Nutrition Antileprosy (NAL) diet were also found effective in suppressing the growth of M. leprae in mouse foot-pad. Of the two liposoluble derivatives of DFS tested (DFS LS-I and DFS LS-II), DFS LS-II was found more effective in suppressing the growth of M. leprae in foot-pads of mice.
