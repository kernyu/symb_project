A genetic analysis of a multiply antibiotic-resistant strain of Staphylococcus epidermidis was performed. Experiments designed to show reversion of organisms to antibiotic susceptibility, as well as studies of the influence of ultraviolet irradiation of phage on the transduction frequencies of the resistance markers, indicated that determinants of chloramphenicol (cml), tetracycline (tet), and neomycin (neo) resistance are present on separate plasmids, but the streptomycin marker is chromosomal. In 2 to 6% of tetracycline-resistant transductants, co-transduction of cml was also observed. By using CsCl-dye density gradients followed by neutral sucrose gradients, the plasmids carrying cml, tet, and neo could be isolated and their molecular weights could be determined. The tetracycline plasmid is shown to be incompatible with one of the cryptic plasmids of a recipient strain.
