We have previously reported that Legionella pneumophila antigens can induce interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) in vitro and in vivo in mice. Furthermore, treatment of murine polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) cultures with these cytokines resulted in augmented killing of the bacteria in vitro. The purpose of the present study was to determine if these findings could be extended to human responses. Here we report that Legionella antigens induced IFN-gamma and TNF in nonimmune human leukocytes cultures, and that these cytokines were able to stimulate the bactericidal activity of isolated PMN against L. pneumophila in vitro. Furthermore, optimal production of IFN-gamma was found in cultures which were enriched for large granular lymphocytes (LGL). The phenotype of IFN-producing cells was determined to be CD11+, CD16+, CD2+, and negative for CD4, CD8, CD14, and Leu 7. Additionally, Legionella-infected monocytes were found to produce TNF in a dose-dependent response to the number of infecting bacteria, and the addition of recombinant IFN-gamma to infected monocytes resulted in augmented production of TNF in a synergistic manner. Finally, treatment of PMN with recombinant IFN-gamma and recombinant TNF augmented their bactericidal activity against Legionella in a dose-dependent response. Thus, cytokines which can be induced by L. pneumophila antigens are able to stimulate PMN function in vitro, suggesting that resistance to infection results from a complex interaction of cytokines and cell responses.
