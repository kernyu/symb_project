Entry of methotrexate (MTX) into the folate prototrophic bacterium Streptococcus pneumoniae was poorly inhibited by folate or its natural derivative folinic acid, suggesting that if MTX is transported via a folate transporter, the affinity of that transporter for MTX is higher than for folate. In the range of concentrations tested, MTX uptake was non-concentrative and decreased in ATP-depleted bacteria. When the external concentration of MTX was increased from 1 X 10(-7) M to 1 X 10(-6) M, uptake became saturated and was insensitive to ionophores. However when external MTX concentrations were increased to 1 X 10(-5) M, uptake increased linearly, and was inhibited by the ionophores carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) and valinomycin, suggesting that the process was energized by the protonmotive force (delta p) at this concentration. A model for MTX entry in S. pneumoniae is proposed with respect to these results. The high level of resistance to MTX of the nonsense mutant amiA9 cannot be entirely explained by a decrease in MTX uptake.
