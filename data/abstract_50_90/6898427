Chemotherapeutic activity of various benzylpenicillin combinations with 10-nitro-so-trans-anti-cys-perhydroacridine (MT-2) was studied on 2 experimental staphylococcal infections caused by pathogenic penicillin resistant strains of staphylococci. It was found that the combined use of the antibiotic and MT-2 in doses of 25-100 and 12.5 mg/kg respectively administered subcutaneously increased the therapeutic effect of benzylpenicillin as compared to the antibiotic used alone. The oral use of MT-2 in a dose of 400 mg/kg also increased the therapeutic action of benzylpenicillin used in a dose of 100 mg/kg subcutaneously simultaneously with MT-2. A favourable effect of ointments containing MT-2 in a concentration of 10-20 per cent and benzylpenicillin in a dose of 50 000 or 100 000 units per 1 g of the ointment was noted in treatment of mice with localized staphylococcal infection.
