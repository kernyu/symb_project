Some mutants and stock strains of Escherichia coli K12 were sensitive to acriflavine in the presence of inorganic phosphate but were resistant to acriflavine in its absence. They mutated spontaneously to resistance to acriflavine plus phosphate. The synergistic effect of phosphate on acriflavine sensitivity was increased at high pH values. Genetic analysis suggested that the mutations occurred in the gene acrA. Electron microscopic observation suggested that the presence of acriflavine plus phosphate affected the structure of the plasma membrane and the cytoplasm under it. This structural alteration was not caused by acriflavine alone. Acridine orange plus phosphate can more effectively eliminate the plasmid F8-gal+ than acridine orange alone.
