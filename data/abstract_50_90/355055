104 mutants resistant to nystatin were isolated after UV-treatment of two haploid marked strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The analysis of resistance to three polyene antibiotics allowed to determine 8 phenotype classes of mutants including those resistant to nystatin but in various combinations showing hypersensitivity to levorin and (or) amphotericin B. The analysis of UV absorption spectra of sterolic extracts prepared from cells of different mutants showed that similar quality changes in sterol composition could be associated both with polyresistant an supersensitive phenotype. New type of mutants resistant to nystatin and supersensitive to levorin and (or) amphotericin B seems to be promising for studies on the mechanisms of action of polyene antibiotics, the bases of resistance to them and also in consideration of the possibility to increase the efficiency of antimycotic antibiotic therapy.
