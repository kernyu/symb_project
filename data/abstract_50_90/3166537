The efficacy of various antimicrobial and anti-ulcer agents on the elimination of Campylobacter pylori in duodenal ulcer patients was investigated. Ranitidine, cimetidine, pirenzepine, aluminium phosphate gel as well as combinations of H2-receptor antagonists or pirenzepine + penicillin V, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, phenyl-mercuryborate or rifampicin had no influence on C. pylori in vivo. Short term elimination of C. pylori was achieved in 3/15 patients treated with ranitidine + bacampicillin and in 1/5 treated with cimetidine + metronidazole. This elimination was accompanied by a significant reduction of polymorphonuclear infiltration of the antral mucosa. Development of bacterial resistance was observed in patients with additional quinolones, metronidazole and rifampicin but not in patients treated with betalactam antibiotics.
