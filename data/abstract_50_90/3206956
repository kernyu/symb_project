The electron microscopic study of cells HEp-2 and the complex microbiological and morphological study of tissues and organs of guinea pigs and mice infected with the isogenic pairs of Yersinia strains (Y. pseudotuberculosis I and Y. enterocolitica 09) differing in the presence of the calcium-dependence plasmid, as well as Y. pseudotuberculosis mutants resistant to rifampicin, nalidixic acid or crystal violet without this plasmid, have revealed that the invasiveness and cytotoxicity of the infective agents are not directly related to the presence of the above-mentioned plasmid in these bacteria. The use of the quantitative characteristics of virulence, such as penetration ability, intracellular multiplication, dissemination and the formation of degenerative changes, has made it possible to find out that the mutants of Y. pseudotuberculosis I, yielding the negative result in the keratoconjunctivitis test and resistant to the above-mentioned antimicrobial substances, can be arranged in the following order according to the degree of attenuation: rifr mutants--nalr mutants--kvlr mutants. In contrast to Y. pseudotuberculosis I, the loss of the calcium-dependence plasmid by Y. enterocolitica 09 is accompanied by an essential decrease in their invasive and cytotoxic properties, but this relationship is indirect and unstable. The proposed criteria intended for use in the evaluation of the degree of the manifestation of the invasive and cytotoxic properties of bacteria can be useful for the selection of optimally attenuated Yersinia strains showing promise as vaccine strains.
