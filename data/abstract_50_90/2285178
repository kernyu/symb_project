The concept conceived 5 years ago is now a reality. Physicians have information readily available for empiric prescribing from the home, office, or hospital. The other two hospitals in the city have implemented the systems. The reaction of physicians has been extremely favorable. In fact, two new publications for the outpatient/community and for the pediatric populations are now under way at the suggestion of physicians. Plans are in place to assess physician satisfaction and use of the information sheet within the coming year. Presently, too little time has passed to evaluate whether changes in prescribing have actually occurred. In fact, it may never be possible to identify how many instances of inadvisable prescribing are prevented with good initial information. However, for the relatively low cost involved, this has been an exciting new opportunity for education, as well as a method to promote cost-effective and appropriate antibiotic therapy.
