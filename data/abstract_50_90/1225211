Dilution of the fermentation broths with water before the mycelium separation lowered the specific cake resistance. The effect of the dilution on the filtration duration was different and depended on the fermentation broth type. As for the erythromycin fermentation broth, the time of its filtration decreased after the dilution, while the filtration time of the fermentation broths of the other 2 antibiotic-producing organisms increased after the dilution.
