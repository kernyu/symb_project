This study in isolated rat hepatocytes sought to determine if the changes in membrane potential associated with intracellular alkalinization or acidification could be attributed to changes in K+ conductance. Intracellular pHi was manipulated using the 'NH4+-pulse' method: inducing intracellular alkalinization with NH4Cl (10 mM), and producing acidification by diluting the NH4+-loaded cells with ammonium ion-free buffer or by adding sodium proprionate. Membrane potential and resistance were measured in freshly isolated rat liver cells using intracellular microelectrodes. The results indicated that intracellular alkalinization was associated with hyperpolarization and decreased membrane resistance, whereas intracellular acidification caused depolarization with increased membrane resistance. As pHi-mediated electrogenic responses have been related to changes in K+ conductance in other epithelial tissues, the influence of K+ transport inhibitors on NH4+-evoked electrical effects was examined. NH4Cl-evoked membrane potential changes were inhibited by the K+ channel blockers, quinine and barium and in potassium depolarized cells (cells bathed in a high K+ medium where [K+]in = [K+]out = 140 mM). Furthermore, Rubidium-86 (86Rb+) efflux from preloaded hepatocytes, a measure of K+ permeability, was enhanced following intracellular alkalinization but inhibited by intracellular acidification. Thus, these results indicate that pHi-evoked electrogenic effects in hepatocytes are mediated through changes in K+ conductance.
