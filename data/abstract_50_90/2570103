Between July 1984 and August 1985, 200 cases of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) occurred in a large, tertiary care, medical school-affiliated hospital. During this period, a limited outbreak, causing serious infections, was identified in the Intensive Care Unit and was contained by appropriate infection control measures. Bacteriophage typing and surveillance cultures failed to identify a common or single source of dissemination of these strains. It appears that MRSA strains have emerged in Israel as endemic pathogens in hospitals, capable of causing serious nosocomial outbreaks.
