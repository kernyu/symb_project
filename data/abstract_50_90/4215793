Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) of Bacillus subtilis var. amylosacchariticus showed almost the same ability as B. subtilis Marburg to induce transfer of several genetic markers in DNA-mediated transformation. DNA-DNA hybridization data also showed an intimate relationship between the two strains. Genetic elements involved in the production of extracellular alpha-amylase (EC 3.2.1.1.) in B. subtilis var. amylosacchariticus were studied by using DNA-mediated transformation. Two Marburg derivatives, NA20(amyR2) and NA20-22(amyR1), produced about 50 and 10 U of alpha-amylase per mg of cells, respectively, whereas B. subtilis var. amylosacchariticus produced as much as 150 U of the enzyme per mg of cells. When B. subtilis var. amylosacchariticus was crossed with strain NA20-22 as recipient, transformants that acquired high alpha-amylase productivity (about 50 U/mg of cells) were obtained. Genetic analysis revealed that a regulator gene (amyR) for alpha-amylase synthesis was found in B. subtilis var. amylosacchariticus, as in the case of B. natto 1212 (amyR2) and B. subtilis Marburg (amyR1). The allele was designated amyR3; it is phenotypically indistinguishable from amyR2, but is readily distinguishable from amyR1. The presence of amyR3 was not sufficient for an organism to render production of an exceptional amount of alpha-amylase. Extra-high alpha-amylase producers could be obtained by crossing B. subtilis var. amylosacchariticus as donor with strain NA20 as recipient. The transformants produced the same or even greater amounts of the enzyme than the donor strain. Results suggest the presence of another gene that is involved in the production of the exceptional amount of alpha-amylase.
