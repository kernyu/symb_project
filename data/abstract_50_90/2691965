The authors studied the activity of fosfomycin (FOS) and/or gentamicin (GEN) against a Klebsiella pneumoniae strain resistant to all beta-lactams--except cephamycins and imipenem--by production of a plasmid mediated extended broad-spectrum beta-lactamase-TEM-3, to all aminoglycosides--except gentamicin--by production of a plasmid mediated 6' aminoglycoside acetyltransferase IV, to sulfonamides and to tetracyclines. In vitro, the combination FOS (MIC = MBC = 32 mg/l) + GEN (MIC = MBC = 2) appeared indifferent (FIC = 0.75; FBC = 1). In vivo, on experimental endocarditis in rabbits, FOS alone was ineffective, GEN alone was active but only at high dose regimen, FOS - GEN combination was active as compared with controls. Fosfomycin - gentamicin combination may be an alternative in the therapy of severe infections due to multiresistant Enterobacteriacae.
