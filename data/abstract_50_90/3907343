Clavulanic acid, a potent beta-lactamase inhibitor, was studied in fixed combination with ticarcillin and used with tobramycin as empiric therapy for fever in the immunocompromised host. Fifty febrile episodes were evaluated in patients with hematologic malignancy and/or neutropenia. Eighty-one percent of evaluable infections treated with the study regimen of ticarcillin, clavulanic acid, and tobramycin responded. Seventy-four percent of evaluable infections treated with the control regimen of piperacillin, tobramycin, and vancomycin responded (p = 0.4). Resistance to piperacillin and ticarcillin were noted in 23.8 percent of 21 isolated organisms. Resistance to ticarcillin and clavulanic acid was noted in only one (4.7 percent) of the isolated organisms (p = 0.092). Untoward reactions, including rash, nephrotoxicity, and superinfection, were unusual and occurred with equal frequency in the study and control groups. Clavulanic acid in combination with ticarcillin was effective and safe in treating fever in the immunocompromised host.
