One hundred clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were checked for their sensitivity towards silver nitrate. Majority of the isolates were resistant at 20 mg/L and the resistance decreased with increasing concentration of silver nitrate, only 5% of the organisms showed resistance above 70 mg/L. These silver-resistant isolates were further checked for their resistance towards mercury and cadmium at 20 mg/L of concentration and the level of resistance was found to be 33 and 40%, respectively. A correlation between silver ion resistance and concurrent mercury and cadmium ion resistance was observed, suggesting a possible linkage between resistance towards various metal ions.
