The interrelationships between drugs and parasite surfaces are considered under the headings of (a) effects on membrane transport, (b) drug uptake mechanisms and (c) effects on surface morphology and function: praziquantel is discussed under a separate heading. The range of chemotherapeutic compounds that cause permeability changes and concomitant morphological disruption is discussed in terms of mode of drug action. Interpretation of the available data renders it difficult to identify the primary mode of action in the drugs considered. Drug uptake mechanisms are known for relatively few compounds; drug resistance as a function of drug acquisition is discussed. The role of the parasite surface as a specific drug target is argued.
