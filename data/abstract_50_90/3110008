The complete nucleotide sequence of pTZ12, a chloramphenicol-resistance (CmR) plasmid (2517 bp) derived from Corynebacterium xerosis plasmid pTZ10, has been determined after propagation in Bacillus subtilis. The nucleotide sequence of pTZ12 suggests that a recombination event may have occurred naturally within the open reading frames for the Rep protein of pT181 (or a pT181-like plasmid) and pC221 (or a pC221-like plasmid).
