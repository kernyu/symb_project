Clinical specimens from 243 patients attending the ENT clinics at King Abdul Aziz University Hospital, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia were investigated for the pathogens attributing to otitis media and tonsillitis. In children as well as in adults with otitis media, the main bacterial causative organisms were Staph, aureus and Ps. aeruginosa; Asp. flavus was detected in 1% and 4% of adult and children cases of otitis media. In tonsillitis H. influenzae, Strept. pneumoniae, Staph. aureus, Strept. gr. A were isolated in only 18% of the children and Strept. pneumoniae, Strept. gr A in 16% of adults. A possible involvement of viruses in tonsillitis is indicated.
