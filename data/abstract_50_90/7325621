The data on the drug sensitivity of 517 staphylococcal strains isolated from the prostate secretion, separate contents of the right and left seminal vesicles, ejaculate and urine of 250 male patients with inflammatory diseases of the genitalia are presented. It is shown that aminoglycoside antibiotics, rifampicin, lincomycin and nitrofurans are the drugs of choice in the treatment of such patients. The resistance of the staphylococcal strains to 14 main antibacterial drugs widely used in the clinical practice was studied for a period of 1971--1978. It was found that the number of the staphylococcal cultures resistant to the drugs except furagin increased. The increase in the resistance level to ampicillin, erythromycin oleandomycin, kanamycin, nevigramon and biseptol was the highest. 95.7 +/- 2.2 per cent of the staphylococcal strains were polyresistant.
