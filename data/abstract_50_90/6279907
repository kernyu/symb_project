Laboratory and clinical studies were performed as follows on ceftizoxime (CZX), a new cephalosporin antibiotic. 1. Susceptibility of clinically isolated bacteria to CZX and cefotiam (CTM) or sulbenicillin (SBPC). Antibacterial activities of CZX and CTM were compared against S. aureus, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, H. influenzae and E. aerogenes; CZX was compared with SBPC against Ps. aeruginosa. CZX and CTM were nearly equal in activity against S. aureus, but CZX was found to be more active than CTM by 1--10 tubes against E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, H. influenzae and E. aerogenes. Against Ps. aeruginosa, CZX and SBPC were nearly equal in activity. 2. Serum concentration and urinary recovery. Serum concentrations of CZX were measured in 6 patients given CZX for prophylactic purpose during cardiac catheterization. In 2 patients given 20 mg/kg of CZX intravenously, the average serum concentration was 38.9 micrograms/ml at 30 minutes after intravenous bolus injection. In 3 patients given 10 mg/kg of CZX by intravenous drip infusion, the peak average serum concentration was 28.1 micrograms/ml at the end of infusion. Urinary recovery in 2 patients tested was 81.1% and 92.5% until 6--7 hours after intravenous bolus injection. 3. Clinical efficacy. CZX was given intravenously to 24 patients in doses of 30--111 mg/kg (57.1 mg/kg on an average) t.i.d. or q.i.d. for 3--16 days (5.5 days on an average): 1 with lacunar tonsillitis, 4 with acute bronchitis, 12 with pneumonia, 2 with enterocolitis, 2 with soft tissue infection, 2 with lymphadenitis and 1 with UTI. The overall efficacy rate was 95.8%, i.e., efficacy was excellent in 10 (41.7%), good in 13 (54.2%), and poor in 1 (4.2%). Bacteriological efficacy was excellent, i.e. 21 of the 23 strains disappeared. One patient had mild and transient diarrhea, but no other laboratory abnormalities were observed during treatment. The above results suggest that CZX is 1 of the most useful antibiotics for treating pediatric infections, especially due to Gram negative bacteria.
