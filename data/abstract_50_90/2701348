Several phenolic glycosides, i.e. acteoside, desrhamnosyl acteoside, and purpureaside A, B and C, exerted weak antibacterial effects on Escherichia coli. Acteoside had antiplasmid effects, including F'lac plasmid elimination, and inhibited kanamycin resistance transfer in E. coli. Acteoside, desrhamnosyl acteoside and purpureaside A displayed antiviral effect on Aujeszky virus. All of the phenolic glycosides decreased some human leucocyte functions, including rosette formation, mitogen-induced blast transformation and phagocytic activity in vitro. The purpureaside C had significant proinflammatory action, however, other phenolic glycosides showed neither proinflammatory nor antiinflammatory effect on carrageenin-induced inflammation in vivo.
