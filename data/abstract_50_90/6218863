Thirty strains of penicillinase-producing Neisseria gonorrhoeae (PPNG) were detected by a rapid iodometric method out of 206 strains isolated from patients with gonorrhoea between January and December 1981. Of the 30 patients, five of the nine women were prostitutes and 14 of the 21 men were infected by prostitutes in or around Fukuoka City, with the exception of one who was infected in Formosa. Treatment with ampicillin or amoxycillin resulted in failure whereas treatment with spectinomycin was successful.
