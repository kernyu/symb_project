Injection of actinomycin D, puromycin and cycloheximide change the genetically determined reaction of rats to acoustic stimuli up to the appearance of resistance to sound. The change in the nature of audiogenic epileptiform seizures correlates with the disturbance of the RNA and protein synthesis in the experimental animals brain. The appearance of sound resistance does not correlate with the degree of inhibition of protein synthesis in the brain. It is assumed that the antiseizure effect of the drugs used is possibly due to their action on the neuromediator systems of the brain.
