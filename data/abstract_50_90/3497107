Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae are found in 87% of all cases of exacerbated chronic obstructive bronchopulmonary disease. Complications of viral respiratory tract disease are most frequently caused by H. influenzae. Not only encapsulated forms of H. influenzae, but also non-encapsulated strains may be responsible for the onset of pneumonia and acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis in adults. The most common symptoms of infections with H. influenzae are cough, dyspnoea, increase in purulent sputum and wheezing. A quantitative sputum culture is recommended for diagnosing chronic obstructive bronchopulmonary disease. Acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis are always treated with antibiotics effective against H. influenzae and pneumococci. As a rule, empirical treatment should suffice in general practice. In the comparison between ampicillin, co-trimoxazole and cefaclor included in the study protocol appended to this report, the latter produced the most favourable results both in the empirical and specific forms of treatment. We would recommend cefaclor as the antibiotic of choice for this disease.
