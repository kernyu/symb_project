The accomplishment of the principles for the prevention of a germ resistance and the development of new principles of treatment and highly effective antituberculotics has led to the fact that nowadays actually each case of tuberculosis may be treated and cured purely internally. This progress in the individual treatment were achieved by recommendations of therapy which are actualized from time to time. The modern treatment consists of a daily application of three effective antituberculotics for two to three months, fellowed by an intermittent application twice a week. The duration of the initial intensive period and the whole time of therapy is determined by the clinical and social state before the beginning and by the combination of drugs. INH, rifampizine, streptomycin and ethambutol form the components of the therapy combinations which at present are to be used no longer than twelve months. The redetection of the special microbiological qualities of the pyrazineamide and their importance for the prevention of relapses introduces the last phase of the development of the therapy of tuberculosis. By its means it is possible to shorten the duration of the treatment to 9 months and less and thus to increase the acceptability and cooperation, to decrease the toxicity and costs.
