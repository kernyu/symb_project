Osteomyelitis of the jaws caused by a Bacteroides species is uncommon. A case of osteomyelitis of the mandible caused by penicillin-resistant Bacteroides ruminicola is reported. The diagnosis was confirmed by isolation of the organism and bone scan (99mTc medronate disodium) of the mandible. Clindamycin and hyperbaric oxygen therapy resolved the infection.
