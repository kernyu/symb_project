Patients with chronic bronchitis at exacerbation and in remission were treated by immunocorrective agents. A study was made of the immune status, interferon synthesizing capacity of blood leukocytes, a clinical course of disease and their change resulting from immunocorrective therapy provided at different stages of chronic bronchitis. The authors established disorders in the immune status, a decrease in interferon synthesizing capacity of blood leukocytes which were more noticeable at exacerbation. The use of immunocorrective therapy raised the production of interferon by the patients' blood leukocytes, improved ratios between lymphocyte populations and subpopulations, considerably improved a clinical course of disease, prolonged remission, facilitated a course of exacerbations and decreased resistance to anti-bacterial therapy.
