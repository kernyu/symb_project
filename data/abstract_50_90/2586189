The aim of this study was to evaluate a degree of contribution of mechanically cleansed municipal sewage in a spread in on environment of bacteria of Enterobacteriaceae family with special regard to antibiotic resistant strains. High number of bacteria of Enterobacteriaceae family was found in 1 ml of sewage and the number of antibiotic-resistant bacteria was 0.5-50 X 10(3)/ml. Among the strains tested the resistance to more than one antibiotics was encountered. 78.3% of strains transferred antibiotic resistance to E. coli recipient strain, what indicate a participation of potentially pathogenic bacteria from Enterobacteriaceae family in a spread of antibiotic resistance in a environment.
