Faecal carriage rates for aerobic gram-negative bacilli and for antibiotic-resistant Escherichia coli were determined in samples of the Dutch urban population. Of the 741 people studied, 64 were under 1 year old (infants), 53 were 1-5 years old, and there were approximately 200 in each of the age-ranges 6-17 years, 18-49 years and 50-80 years. Carriage rates of E. coli were similar (87-93%) in all age groups, but Klebsiella and Enterobacter species were found more often in specimens from infants and young children than in those from older people. E. coli strains resistant to tetracycline, ampicillin, or sulphamethoxazole or to any one or more of them were detected in 42%, 26%, 46% and 66% respectively of the specimens found to contain E. coli. The corresponding figures for the finding of E. coli populations that were predominantly resistant to tetracycline, ampicillin or sulphamethoxazole were 12%, 6% and 20%. The frequency of resistance to any of these drugs was not related to age or sex of the subjects. All E. coli isolates were sensitive to gentamicin. Among the 577 subjects aged 6-80 years from whose samples E. coli was isolated were 19 who had taken antibacterial drugs in the previous 30 days and 11 who were involved in cattle farming; carriage rates for tetracycline-resistant and sulphonamide-resistant E. coli were significantly higher among these 30 than in the other 547.
