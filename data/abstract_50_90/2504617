Eighty-four strains of Neisseria gonorrhoeae isolated in Munich between January 1987 and June 1988 were characterized in terms of their plasmid content, protein I serovar and susceptibility or resistance to four antimicrobial agents. Eighty two percent of the strains belonged to serogroup 1B, the three most prevalent serovars being 1B-1, 1B-2 and 1B-6. Among the serogroup 1A strains, 1A-2 was the commonest serovar. Fourteen strains (16.7%) lacked the 2.6 Md cryptic plasmid, although two of these strains contained the conjugative gonococcal plasmid. Although some degree of resistance to penicillin and tetracycline was noted, all the strains were sensitive to spectinomycin and cefotiam.
