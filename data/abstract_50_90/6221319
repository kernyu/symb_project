From 1975 to 1980, computerized data on the sensitivity of 11 342 strains of S. aureus to the main antibiotics were evaluated in relation to drug consumption and hospital activity. Sensitivity to tetracyclines and chloramphenicol increased by 7.3% and 11.4% respectively, but sensitivity to gentamicin decreased by 12%. There was no change in sensitivity to other antibiotics. In vitro response to methicillin was found to have a considerable influence on changes in sensitivity. Sensitivity to tetracyclines increased among methicillin-sensitive strains, while methicillin-resistant strains became more sensitive to chloramphenicol and less sensitive to gentamicin. During the same period, the consumption of chloramphenicol, tetracyclines and aminoglycosides decreased by 84%, 54% and 15% respectively. Hospital activity remained unchanged. The fact that methicillin-resistant strains failed to become more sensitive to the main antibiotics, with the exception of chloramphenicol, might be due to antibiotic pressure in intensive care units where these strains are usually isolated.
