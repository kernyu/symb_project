The effectiveness of the complex chemotherapy of experimental tuberculosis in combination with the remedies of pathogenetic therapy has been studied. The immunomodulating action of levamisole, sodium succinate and the positive effect of RNAase on specific resistance in the complex treatment of guinea pigs infected with tuberculosis have been established. On the basis of the pronounced normalization of the systemic and specific resistance characteristics, as well as the clinical effect, the expediency of using levamisole and RNAase in the complex treatment of tuberculosis has been shown.
