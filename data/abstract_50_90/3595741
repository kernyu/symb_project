Coagulase-negative staphylococci isolated from blood or spinal fluid during a period of 1 year in a department of neurosurgery, were analysed by biotyping, antibiotic resistance pattern and plasmid profiles. Altogether 41 isolates from 19 patients were studied. About 90% of the isolates were Staphylococcus epidermidis. The antibiotic resistance pattern seemed to be closely related to antibiotic usage in the unit. Most common was resistance to penicillin (63%), trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole (49%) and cloxacillin (39%) while resistance to gentamicin was seen in only one strain. In several cases species and antibiograms were identical in isolates from different patients. Plasmid pattern analysis could then be used for identification of different strains. In one instance, plasmid pattern and restriction enzyme analysis confirmed that two patients probably were infected by the same strain.
