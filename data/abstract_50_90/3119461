Single dose Augmentin treatment fails to cure an appreciable proportion of patients infected with penicillinase producing Neisseria gonorrhoeae (PPNG) strains in parts of the world where high levels of chromosomally mediated intrinsic resistance are also present in gonococci. The levels of intrinsic resistance to penicillin of 31 PPNG strains isolated in Sydney were assessed by obtaining beta lactamase negative variants of these strains and measuring the minimum inhibitory concentration of penicillin by agar plate dilution techniques. The levels of intrinsic resistance found in these imported PPNG strains were higher than those recorded for local isolates of non-PPNG strains, which indicates that caution should be exercised in the use of single dose Augmentin treatment of infections with PPNG strains in Sydney.
