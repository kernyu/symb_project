Variants of Micrococcus lysodeikticus resistant to 100 micrograms/ml of gramicidin S with preserved resistance in subcultures on media without the antibiotic were isolated as a result of prolonged adaptation on a solid medium with increasing concentrations of gramicidin. The sensitive and resistant cells did not differ by their ability to bind gramicidin. Under the antibiotic effect permeability of the cytoplasmic membranes of the intact cells in the sensitive bacteria appeared to be impaired to a greater extent than that of the membranes of the cells in the resistant variant. Comparison of the lytic activity of gramicidin and its derivatives with respect to the protoplasts prepared with the cells of the initial and resistant variants of M. lysodeikticus revealed much higher resistance of the resistant variant protoplasts to the membrane-disorganizing effect of the preparations. Malate dehydrogenase and NADH-oxidase in the membrane preparations of the resistant variant cells differed from analogous enzymes from the membranes of the initial strain by the levels of their activity and sensitivity to gramicidin. It is likely that during adaptation of M. lysodeikticus to gramicidin significant changes in the cell cytoplasmic membranes occurred.
