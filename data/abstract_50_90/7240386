The organisms designated as Center for Disease Control group JK are gram-positive rods that have previously been described as causing serious infection in compromised hosts. Four years of hospital experience with this group of organisms in Clinical Center patients was reviewed. Studies were also undertaken on specific wards to determine frequency of occurrence and distribution patterns. Inguinal cultures taken on two wards showed that 30 to 35% of patients were colonized with group JK and that newly admitted patients may already be colonized at the time of admission. Colonization was shown to persist for weeks and sometimes months. Isolates obtained throughout the hospital were predominantly from cancer patients, particularly in wounds, abscesses, and drainage sites. Most blood isolates were from granulocytopenic patients with hematological malignancies.
