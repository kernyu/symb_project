Mutants resistant to the protein synthesis inhibitor trichodermin have been selected in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. The mutants vary in their stability from those which rapidly lose their resistance to others which are relatively stable after prolonged growth in nonselective medium. Protein synthesis in extracts from the latter class of mutants (Trir) is resistant to the inhibitory action of trichodermin as compared to similar extracts from wild-type cells. After dissociation into subunits, the ability of the 60S ribosomal subunits from Trir cells to function in a protein-synthesizing system is greatly diminished. This subunit also shows reduced binding of [acetyl-14C]TRICHODERMIN. The lesion in Trir mutants therefore seems to have affected this ribosomal subunit. Trir X Tris hybrids are sensitive to trichodermin indicating that the Trir mutation behaves recessively to Tris in hybrids. The Emtr and Trir markers segregate independently from hybrid cells showing that the Trir mutation is probably not linked to the Emtr locus, which as we have shown earlier affects the 40S ribosomal subunit.
