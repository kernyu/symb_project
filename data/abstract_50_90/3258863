Twenty patients admitted to hospital with serious lower respiratory tract infections entered an open study of 400 mg enoxacin given orally twice a day for a minimum of seven days. Clinical signs and symptoms were completely cured or improved in six of eight patients with pneumonia, in nine of ten patients with bronchitis, and in two patients with bronchiectasis. Enoxacin was effective in eradicating the initial pathogens in 10 of 12 patients with positive cultures. Enoxacin was well tolerated. Only one treatment-related side-effect was observed during the study. Nine patients received concurrent treatment with theophylline, but no signs of theophylline toxicity were seen. Enoxacin is a safe and effective alternative to parenteral treatment of lower respiratory tract infections.
