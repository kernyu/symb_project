A survey of antibiotic resistance in 1,287 strains of Salmonella from bovine, porcine and avian sources in Australia was carried out from 1975 to 1982. Isolates were tested against ampicillin, chloramphenicol, furazolidone, neomycin, streptomycin and tetracycline. Resistance was found to streptomycin in 286 isolates and to tetracycline in 282 isolates. Resistance to other antimicrobials was low and was unrelated to source. One hundred and seventy-three isolates showed multiple resistance to 2 or more antimicrobial agents with resistance to streptomycin and tetracycline being the most common. The overall level of resistance did not change over the period examined.
