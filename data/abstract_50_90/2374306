Quantitative cutaneous bacteriological profile analysis was performed on 20 healthy Japanese adults. Five ecologically different sites were cultured, the forehead, anterior nares, axilla, perineum, and fourth interspace. Antibiotic sensitivity patterns were determined for the various species of coagulase negative cocci (CNS). Aerobic organisms were found in densities exceeding 10(6) per sample for all sites except the forehead (10(4)), while anaerobic Propionibacteria were found in quantities ranging from 10(5) to 10(6) per sample except for the toe web space, which was devoid of anaerobic organisms. CNS were ubiquitous. Staphylococcus aureus varied from 15% to 35%. Lipophilic diphtheroids were found in 50% of the subjects on the forehead and nearly 100% on other sites, whereas multiple antibiotic resistant lipophilic diphtheroids (Group JK) were found in the perineum of 35% and in the toe space of 15%. Gram negative bacilli were uncommon on the forehead, axilla, and the toe web space, but were found in 50% or more in the anterior nares and perineum. Penicillin and ampicillin resistant CNS were commonly seen, while oxacillin and cephalosporin resistance were uncommon. Tetracycline and erythromycin resistance was seen in 35% to 40%.
