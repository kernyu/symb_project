Worms recovered from Oltiparz treated group of mice (500 mg/kg. body weight) show, suntedness, absent or poorly developed tuberculations, destroyed or poorly developed suckers, absence or severe atrophy of testes, complete absence or severe atrophy of ovaries, small or empty vitelline follicles and slightly or not pigmented intestines as compared with controls; the female worms are more affected than males. The morphological changes are apparent after 5 days, 7 days, 20 days and 30 days from drug administration, but are reversible in some surviving worms especially male worms after 60 days from therapy. The previous findings indicate that the drug causes severe degenerative changes in the structure of both S. mansoni male and female worms and that resistance to the drug develops among the Egyptian strain of S. mansoni worms with prolongation the period of worms exposure to the drug. The present results are discussed with those of others with some recommendations.
