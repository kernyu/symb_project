It was shown that the mass-transfer coefficient of non-dissociated benzylpenicillin during extraction was more than 1000 times higher than that during reextraction. For the latter it was found that the aqueous phase exerted limiting resistance during mass-transfer of benzylpenicillin. The effect of a number of factors on the kinetics was shown. These factors were the following: hydrodynamic conditions, temperature, pH of the aqueous phase.
