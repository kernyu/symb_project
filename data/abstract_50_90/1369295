To produce Aspergillus oryzae alkaline protease (Alp) in an osmophilic yeast Zygosaccharomyces rouxii, we constructed an expression plasmid consisting of the Z. rouxii glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) promoter, the prepro-Alp cDNA of A. oryzae, the whole sequence of Z. rouxii plasmid pSR1, and the G418 resistant gene. The resulting plasmid, when introduced into Z. rouxii cells, directed the secretion of a large amount (about 300 mg/l) of Alp into the culture medium. The N-terminus and specific activity of the enzyme were identical to those of A. oryzae Alp.
