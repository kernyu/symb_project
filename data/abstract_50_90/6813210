Strains of staphylococci sensitive and resistant to ampicillin were examined in their resistance to oxacillin, propicillin and penicillin G. For all the examined strains oxacillin showed values in the range of sensitiveness, propicillin proved itself distinctly more active in vitro than penicillin G resp. V. The satisfactory pharmacokinetic properties and the higher stability against penicillinase might result in an increased therapeutical security of the treatment with propicillin compared with penicillin V.
