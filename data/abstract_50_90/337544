The hospital records of 48 patients with infections due to Serratia marcescens were reviewed. Isolates from these patients had been cultured during the period from August 1973 through July 1975, at which time an increase in frequency of infections due to Serratia had been noted. Most of these patients were elderly males with chronic debilitating diseases. All patients had received antimicrobial therapy prior to the time Serratia was first isolated. The majority had had indwelling urinary catheters inserted during some period of their hospitalization. Isolates were obtained predominantly from the urinary tract. In six of the 11 patients who died, Serratia appeared to play a role in the outcome, and all three patients with Serratia septicemia died. Serratia marcescens can be a virulent pathogen with a high degree of resistance to antibacterial agents. Attention must be given to the use of a sterile technique for insertion of urinary catheters, frequent care and cleansing of the catheter-meatal junction and use of a closed drainage system.
