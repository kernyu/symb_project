Ramoplanin (A-16686/MDL 62,198) is a novel lipoglycopeptide antimicrobial, comprised of three closely related polypeptides containing chlorinated phenyl moieties and D-mannose, isolated from the fermentation products of Actinoplanes sp. ATCC 33076. The antimicrobial activity of ramoplanin is limited to Gram-positive bacteria and its reportedly unacceptable administration side-effects suggest that any potential clinical role will be limited to the topical therapy of superficial skin infections and the eradication of bacteria, representing a possible nosocomial cross-infection source, from carriage sites. In this study the MICs of ramoplanin have been determined for methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis and S. haemolyticus and compared with those of two glycopeptide antimicrobials, vancomycin and teicoplanin. MICs were determined using an agar incorporation technique in Mueller-Hinton medium with an inoculum of 10(5) cfu. Ramoplanin was 2-8 times more active than either vancomycin or teicoplanin against methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant isolates of S. aureus and methicillin-susceptible isolates of S. epidermidis. Isolates of methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis and both methicillin-susceptible and -resistant isolates of S. haemolyticus were generally less susceptible to teicoplanin than to vancomycin. Ramoplanin was significantly more active than either vancomycin or teicoplanin against these isolates. These results suggest that the clinical evaluation of ramoplanin as a topical antibacterial agent for the control of superficial infections caused by Staphylococcus spp. and for the eradication of methicillin-resistant S. aureus from carriage sites, is justified.
