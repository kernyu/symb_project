Infections due to Serratia marcescens were studied in 23 different hospitals. A retrospective study was done in 4 hospitals; all isolates were compared by serological typing, antibiograms, bacteriocin production, and bacteriocin sensitivity. 2 of the hospitals were having cross-infection problems due to antibiotic-resistant strains, but the other 2 had little or no cross-infection. Outbreaks were studied in 19 other hospitals. 9 of these outbreaks were classified as "common source" since contaminated "sterile solutions" were incriminated as the cause in each. One hospital had a "pseudo-outbreak," in which Serratia from E.D.T.A. blood-collecting tubes contaminated blood-cultures as they were collected. All 10 of these strains from common-source outbreaks were generally sensitive to antibiotics. Outbreaks in 9 other hospitals resulted from cross-infection and were caused by strains which were very resistant to antibiotics. Guidelines for detecting outbreaks are given and control measures are suggested.
