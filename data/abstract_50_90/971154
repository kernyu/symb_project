In investigating the stress effects of chilling (2-3 degrees C) and hypothermia (2-3 degrees C drop in body core temperature mediated by exposure to hyperbaric helium-oxygen atmosphere) on mouse resistance to "influenza," it was noted that these stresses adversely affected the course of pulmonary infection produced by aerosols of the NWS strain of influenza virus. Comparatively, respiratory LD50 values for control animals were about 25 virus plaque-forming units (PFU) with median mortality occurring on day 13. The LD50 values for mice chilled at 2-3 degrees C were about 15 PFU with median mortality on day 7, and for mice exposed to hyperbaric helium, about 12 PFU with median mortality on day 6. Cold or hyperbaric stress impaired interferon production. Impairment was observed at 24 h but not at 12 h post-challenge and persisted for several days until mice became moribund.
