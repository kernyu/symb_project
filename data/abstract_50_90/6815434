Four acinetobacter and 5 Ps. aeruginosa strains which were isolated in Clinical pathology Lab. of Hacettepe Univ. Med. School, and found to be resistant to Amikacin were tested for infectious drug resistance, using conventional in vitro transfer technique repeatedly. E. coli K12 Nalr (for Acinetobacters), and Ps. aeruginosa (for Pseudomonads) strains were used as recipients. For cultures and transfer experiments NB No : 2, and for the selection Mc Conkey Agar plates with nalidixic acid and proper antibiotics were used. Inspite of some variable and curious positive findings, it was not possible to transfer Amikacin - resistance to recipients with certainty. Results suggest that this characteristic was not controlled by R plasmids and hence was not "infectious", or at least could not been transferred by the technique we used.
