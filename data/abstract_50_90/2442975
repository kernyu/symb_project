Several drug resistance patterns were determined in 170 pathogenic strains of E. coli isolated in 6 Polish towns from infant diarrhoea. The most frequent were strains resistant to 5 different drugs: ampicillin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, streptomycin and sulfonamide. Conjugative R factors of 30 strains of the same resistance pattern (Ap Tc Cm Sm Su) were characterised by determining their Fi(F) character, incompatibility and molecular weight.
