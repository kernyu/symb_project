260 strains of Neisseria meningitidis, collected on throat swabs performed systematically on healthy carriers, were tested for antibiotics and sulfonamides sensitivity. The M. I. C. for sulfonamides and antibiotics of each strain has been determined with the agar dilution technic. To study the sensitivity to sulfonamides 5% hemolysed horse blood has been added to the Mueller-Hinton medium. To study the sensitivity to antibiotics, 5% sheep blood has been added to Mueller-Hinton. Results may be so resumed:--Sulfadiazine: 80% of the strains are sensitive to 1 mcg/ml, 98% to 64 mcg/ml. --Chloramphenicol: 91% of the strains sensitive to 1 mcg/ml. --Penicillin and ampicillin: nearly 90% of the strains sensitive to 0.015 mcg/ml. --Cephalothin: 95% of the strains sensitive to 0.125 mcg/ml. --Tetracyclines: 88% of the strains sensitive to 0 5 mcg/ml. --Spiramycin: 98% of the strains sensitive to 4 mcg/ml. With each type of Meningococcus, distribution of the M. I. C. for each antibiotic has been studied. It appears that Meningococcus remains very sensitive to antibiotics. For sulfonamides sensitivity, this study doesn't show as frequent a resistance as some suggested. May be this is because of the technic of sulfamidogram using growing media containing inhibitors.
