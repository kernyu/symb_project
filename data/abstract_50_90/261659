The aim of the paper was to study the effect of benzylpenicillin, cloxacillin and ampicillin in combination with streptomycin, kanamycin and gentamicin on antibiotic-resistant strains of Streptococcus group D. Most frequently the synergistic effect was observed when cloxacillin was combined with streptomycin (76%), cloxacillin with kanamycin (63%) and benzylpenicillin with streptomycin (53%). In some cases the synergistic effect was so pronounced that MIC of two antibiotics used in combination was equal or lower than levels of these antibiotics in patients sera. It is assumed that these combinations may have therapeutic meaning.
