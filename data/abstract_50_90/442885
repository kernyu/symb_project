The dynamics of natural resistance factors (complement, lysozyme, the bactericidal potency of blood serum) were found to be similar in rabbits with the toxic lesions of the liver resulting from the administration of carbon tetrachloride and in intact homologous rescipients receiving the serum of poisoned animals. Simultaneously a decrease in the complement titre and an increase in lysozyme activity and in the bactericidal potency of blood serum were observed. The effect thus revealed could be suppressed by treating the serum with contrical, a polyvalent proteinase inhibitor.
