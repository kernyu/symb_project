The examination of 1950 different water samples showed that 21,5 percent of them were microbiologically not safe and had an high MPN of E. coli, 2,3 percent of these strains belonged to enteropathogenic groups. The percentage depended on the character of water establishment, and was in small water supplies as high as 8 percent, in swimming pools 11 percent. There were identified the following OK groups of EEC: O25:K11, O28:K73, O55:K59, O75:K80, O115, O126:K71, O146, which are well known as causes of acute enteric diseases of children and adults. In case of special epidemiological or other occasions, it would be useful to examine the E. coli strains, isolated from different water samples serologically, in order to identify them as enteropathogenic eventually.
