Two collections of Escherichia coli from human hosts and one from free-ranging African yellow baboons were examined for the ability to utilize various sugars (biotype) and for resistance to antibiotics. The frequency of antibiotic resistance in the E. coli flora of baboons that feed regularly in village garbage dumps was found to be no greater than that in baboons not associated with human habitation. The frequency of antibiotic resistance in E. coli isolated from baboons is similar to that in E. coli isolated from humans before the widespread use of antibiotics but significantly lower than that in recent isolates from humans. The biotype data indicate that the amount and distribution of genetic variation in the E. coli among free-ranging baboon troops are similar to those in isolates from humans. However, E. coli isolates from baboons are able to utilize a greater variety of sugars as their sole carbon source, possibly because of a greater variety of sugars in the baboon diet.
