From 1975 through 1984, 24 patients at the Medical University of South Carolina underwent surgical resection for complications of pulmonary tuberculosis. The complications fell into three major categories: persistent or drug-resistant disease, bronchiectasis, and hemoptysis. The major indications for surgical intervention included hemoptysis (14 patients), drug resistance (5), possible neoplasm (3), and bronchiectasis (2). Impaired pulmonary function was common. Surgical therapy generally necessitated lobectomy, sometimes resulted in substantial blood loss, and had a total major and minor complication rate of 46%. Despite these problems, the long-term prognosis after successful resection is good.
