Thirty seven cases of malaria were diagnosed in the Christchurch Hospital Microbiology Laboratory from January 1978 to December 1983. Cases occurred in most age groups with various occupations. Prophylactic drugs may not give protection because of lack of patient compliance and/or parasite resistance. A case of malaria which recrudesced following treatment recommended in New Zealand is also included.
