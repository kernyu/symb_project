Of 133 Corynebacterium diphtheriae isolates from diphtheria patients in Jakarta, Indonesia, 86% were resistant to greater than or equal to 32 micrograms of tetracycline per ml. All isolates were sensitive to ampicillin, cephalothin, chloramphenicol, clindamycin, penicillin, erythromycin, and kanamycin. The general resistance of C. diphtheriae to tetracycline in this part of Indonesia appears to be unique compared with resistance reported in studies done in other parts of the world.
