Recombination occurs by infectious gene transfer in bacteria, at rates much lower than recombination by sexual reproduction in other organisms. Thus, recombination may accelerate evolution in bacteria only under restricted conditions, such as occur when mutations at several loci are required for the evolution of an expanded ecological niche. Mathematical ("chemostat") models of several such cases--evolution of independence from three limiting essential or "interactive-essential" resources; evolution of the ability to use three new substitutable resources; and evolution of resistance to three growth inhibitors--were analyzed by computer simulation. All combinations of three mutation rates (U) and four values for the "infectious gene transfer rate parameter" (chi) were considered. Recombination accelerated evolution most when U was low and chi was high, but was unlikely to have large effects when chi was low enough to be realistic for natural populations of Escherichia coli. Recombination had the largest effects when resources were substitutable, and in that case could have substantially reduced the chance of random loss of the favored "triple mutant" while it was still rare. The simulations also revealed some interesting features of selection for an expanded niche. Evolution of independence from essential resources occurred more rapidly when the resources were weakly complementary than when they did not interact. Selection for the ability to use all substitutable resources was weak after all intermediate types that used only one or two of the resources had arisen.
