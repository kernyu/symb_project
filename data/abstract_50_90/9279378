The Thy- mutants of Chinese hamster ovary cells have a 5- to 10-fold elevated pool of deoxycytidine 5'-triphosphate (dCTP) and are auxotrophic for thymidine as an apparent consequence of a single mutation. thy is also a mutator gene, elevating the spontaneous rate of mutation 5- to 200-fold for at least two genetic markers. Previous experiments suggested that this mutator activity was caused by the elevated pool of dCTP in Thy- cells. To test this, the dCTP and deoxythymidine 5'-triphosphate (dTTP) pools were manipulated by altering the external concentration of thymidine in the growth medium. The rate of mutation at one genetic locus, ouabain resistance, was directly related to cellular dCTP content. At the highest level of dCTP the rate in one Thy- strain was approximately 200 times that of wild-type cells. However, the relationship between dCTP content and the rate of mutation at the ouabain locus was different for two mutator strains and wild-type cells. The rate of mutation at a second locus, thioguanine resistance, was increased approximately 10-fold over wild type regardless of the dCTP-dTTP pools. These experiments suggest that the mutator activity of thy is clearly related to dCTP content, but the dCTP level alone does not appear to be the cause of the mutator.
