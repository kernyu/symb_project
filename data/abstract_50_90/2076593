Cefotaxime is a parenteral broad-spectrum cephalosporin, used extensively worldwide for chemotherapy of serious infections. Since its release in 1979, cefotaxime has also been studied to minimize surgery-related infections and, more than any other new compound, has been used in a volume of evaluable cases. Because of the current cost-containment medical practice environment, most cefotaxime prophylaxis studies have established single-dose or short-course regimens. Over 9000 published cefotaxime prophylaxis cases were reviewed, and 81 references were cited. Single-dose cefotaxime was clearly indicated for a wide variety of operations, including hysterectomy, cesarean sections, bone and joint procedures, upper gastrointestinal cases, biliary tract procedures, transurethral resections, open urologic procedures, and some vascular cases. Approximately 24 hr of prophylaxis (cefotaxime X 4 doses) may be required for colorectal resections, cardiac surgery, head and neck surgery, transplants, and some pediatric surgical cases. Although contaminated abdominal cases and trauma surgery were not a true prophylaxis use, cefotaxime regimens have reduced wound morbidity to less than or equal to 10%. Changing to one- to four-dose schedules will have very favorable clinical impact by reducing prophylaxis cost, pharmacy preparation time, adverse reactions, and antimicrobic-resistance pressures. Surgeons should not hesitate to employ new cephalosporins (cefotaxime and others) with proved limited dose indications that would greatly benefit their patients and the hospital environment.
