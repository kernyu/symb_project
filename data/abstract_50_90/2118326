A comparison of efficacies, costs, and effects on vaginal microflora of one preoperative and three postoperative 1-g doses of cefazolin versus those of one preoperative 1-g dose of ceftriaxone was done with 65 and 73 women, respectively, undergoing elective vaginal hysterectomy. Patient infection rates were not statistically different between the cefazolin group (six events in 6 of 73 patients [8.2%]) and the ceftriaxone group (11 events in 9 of 65 patients [13.8%]). Side effects, including diarrhea, were minimal and similar between the two groups. Significant shifts in the cervicovaginal microflora of the patients occurred postoperatively, with a marked increase in enterococci and a drop in nonenterococcal streptococci. No shifts among aerobic, facultative gram-negative rods and staphylococci were observed. Among the anaerobes, a significant decrease in the number of patients harboring nonsporulating, gram-positive rods and a less striking concomitant increase in Bacteriodes species and members of the family Peptococcaceae were noted. No qualitative differences were noted between the two groups that received prophylactic therapy. Aside from enterococci, cefazolin or ceftriaxone resistance among vaginal isolates (greater than or equal to 10(3)/ml) was minimal. Selection of resistant isolates was not different between the treatment groups. We could not detect a difference between a single 1-g dose of ceftriaxone and multidose cefazolin for infection prophylaxis in patients undergoing a vaginal hysterectomy. However, the total acquisition, preparation, and administration costs were greater for the ceftriaxone regimen than they were for the cefazolin regimen. Cefazolin should therefore remain the drug of choice for infection prophylaxis in uncomplicated vaginal hysterectomies.
