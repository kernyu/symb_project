Spores of Bacillus subtilis NCTC 10073 were converted to ion-exchange (Ca, H) forms and coat-defective (urea-mercaptoethanol, urea-dithiothreitol-sodium lauryl sulphate) forms. The resistance of these to sodium hypochlorite (1000 parts/10(6) free chlorine) was compared and related to uptake from which the assumed monolayer capacities were calculated. Hypochlorite effects on spore protoplasts and cortical fragments were also examined in relation to DPA and hexosamine release. A spore lytic enzyme was extracted and examined in respect of hypochlorite activity. The results are discussed in terms of the mechanism and site of action of hypochlorite on the bacterial spore.
