Different conceptions on value or method of chemoprophylaxis or early therapy in case of postoperative carriers of indwelling catheters caused us to compare the effectivity of Nifurantin and Sulfaclomid. Patients were randomised in three groups (target therapy as per antibiogram, "blind" begin with Nifurantin or Sulfaclomid). A simple blind test was made. Evaluation of results was made on the basis of the antibiograms. No essential microbiological differences were found to exist between trans-urethral and suprapubic catheters. Due to the frequency distribution and the resistance situation, we recommend a "blind" early therapy with Nifurantin and simultaneous urine culture, the result of which may lead to a target change in therapy. Microbiological after-checks are just as essential as the correct use of optimal catheters.
