Theophylline, an inhibitor of cAMP phosphodiesterase, induces in human ovary carcinoma cells (CaOv) a 2-2.5-fold elevation of intracellular cAMP. This rise in the cAMP level is followed by an increase of the activity of 2',5'-oligo(A) synthetase in CaOv cells -insignificant (1.5-fold) after 16 hr incubation, and substantial (3.7-fold) after 30 hr incubation, as well as the development of antiviral resistance. Once CaOv cells have been incubated with the mixtures containing theophylline (2 mM) and lambda-, beta-, and gamma-interferon preparations (0.5-13 IU/ml), the total antiviral effect of the mixtures exceeds that generated by interferon or theophylline separately; the action of the above agents being additive. These data agree with the previously obtained results and support the suggestion that cAMP phosphodiesterase inhibitors partially mimic the antiviral action of interferon.
