Resistance of pathogenic Naegleria to drying, low and high temperature, and two halogens was studied. Dying made trophozoites nonviable instantaneously and cysts nonviable in less than 5 min. Trophozoites degenerated in hours at temperatures below 10 degrees C and in minutes when frozen; cysts survived according to the equation th - t0/theta 1,440/1.122T (t0 is survival at 0 degrees C; Tis temperature between 0 and 10 degrees C), but 1.5 h at --10 degrees C to 1 h at --30 degrees C. At 51, 55, 58, 63, and 65 degrees C, trophozoites survived about 30, 10, 5, 1 and less than 0.5 min, respectively, cysts survived three to four times longer at 51 degrees C and six to seven times longer at 55 to 65 degrees C. Cyst destruction rates by heat indicated first-order kinetics with 25,400 cal/1 degree C for energy of activation. Cyst destruction rates by free chlorine and I2 also conformed to first-order kinetics. Concentration-contact time curves yielded concentration coefficient values of 1.05 for free chlorine and 1.4 for I2 and point to superchlorination as an effective means of destroying the cysts if free residuals are used as a guide and allowance is provided for low temperature and/or high pH waters.
