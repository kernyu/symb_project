Differences in the protein-composition of methicillin resistant (MR) and methicillin sensitive (MS) staphylococci were shown by means of disk electrophoresis. Extracellular proteins of MR and MS staphylococci were studied electrophoretically. The study revealed no relation between the culture grouping by the protein spectra and resistance to methicillin. Comparison of the spectra of soluble intracellular proteins showed a certain correlation with methicillin resistance.
