Methyl 2-pyridyl ketone thiosemicarbazone (MPKT) was found to inhibit bovine herpesvirus-1 (BHV-1) at an ED50 concentration of approximately 5-10 microM. Several virus strains were shown to have similar sensitivity to the drug and serial passage of virus in the presence of MPKT failed to yield resistant progeny. There was evidence for toxic effects on cells at drug concentrations similar to those required to inhibit virus and passage of cells in low concentrations of MPKT gave results suggesting cumulative toxicity. Pre-incubation of cells in the presence of MPKT produced a residual antiviral effect. Taken together, these observations cast doubt on the selectivity of the drug for BHV-1, at least in the bovine system under test.
