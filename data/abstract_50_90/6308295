Antibacterial activity of cefotiam (CTM) against clinically isolated organisms in the field of obstetrics and gynecology was discussed as follows: In the point of view of the MICs peak, CTM was 1-fold worse than CEZ against Gram-positive bacteria, while, in the case of the concentration of CTM required to inhibit the growth of 80% or 90% of the total number of tested Gram-positive organism, antibacterial activity of CTM was approximately identical with that of CEZ, CMZ or SBPC. CTM against E. coli, K, pneumoniae, P. Mirabilis was 16-32-fold more effective than CEZ and 4-16-fold than CMZ. Against indole-positive organisms with CEZ was no effective, CTM was considerably effective. But antibacterial activity of CTM against B. fragilis was insufficient. However, in the case that no spore forming anaerobic organism involved in infectious disease, it is said that existence of aerobic organism is important. As E. coli is representative of aerobic organism, CTM with potent antibacterial activity against this organism is seemed to be effective antibiotic for the gynecological infection.
