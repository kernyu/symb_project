The chemical carcinogen, N-2-acetylaminofluorene (AAF) when bound covalently to DNA induces a majority (greater than 90%) of frameshift mutations. The mutations occur with high frequencies at defined sequences (i.e. mutation hot spots). Two classes of mutation hot spots were found: at repetitive sequences and at specific non-repetitive sequences. Mutations at the repetitive sequences depend upon a functional umuC gene whereas mutations at specific non-repetitive sequences are umuC-independent. The first discovered sequence of this class is the NarI restriction enzyme recognition sequence (5'GGCGCC3'). In an attempt to define a family of such sequences we constructed a related sequence 5'GCGCGC3' within the tetracycline resistance gene of pBR322. This sequence was also found to be an--AAF induced--2 frameshift mutation hot spot in both wild type and umuC strains.
