Several antiseptic and disinfectant compounds have been investigated for their minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) against antibiotic multiresistant strains of S. wien and S. bredeney as well as S. typhi and S. typhimurium strains characterized by wide spectrum of antibiotic sensitivity. The MICs of AgNO3, merthiolate, NaN3, phenol, Zephiran and Desogen were not substantially different for the former and the latter strains; on the contrary, the HgCl2 minimal inhibitory concentration was significantly higher against S. wien and S. bredeney than against the other strains. The mercury resistance appeared plasmid controlled and transferable to E. coli K-12, always associated with antibiotic resistance. The findings, which confirm the results of other AA., seem unrestrictive of the use of HgCl2, because its not probable selective role in the hospital environment.
