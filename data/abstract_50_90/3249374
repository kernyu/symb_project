Sultamicillin fine granules were administered orally to 21 patients with impetigo contagiosa and 1 patient with erysipelas, and its clinical efficacy and safety were assessed. The dosage was 10-30 mg/kg daily. Clinical efficacies of impetigo contagiosa were "excellent" in 20 cases and "fair" in 1 case, with an overall efficacy rate of 95%. The result of treatment in erysipelas was "good". Out of 19 strains of Staphylococcus aureus isolated from foci, 17 strains had high beta-lactamase activities. In these 17 strains, sensitivity to the drug was 2-32-fold higher than to ampicillin, and in 14 out of these 17 strains 4-8-fold higher sensitivity was noted. As side effects, mild diarrhea was seen in 2 patients, but those recovered spontaneously in 3-4 days without particular treatment.
