Calves which had received avirulent infectious bovine rhinotracheitis virus (AV-IBR) by intranasal (IN) administration developed detectable levels of interferon (IF) in nasal secretions as early as 40 hr later. Peak titers (1:640) of IF appeared in secretions 72 to 96 hr after administration of virus, and titers of 1:80 to 1:320 were maintained through the 8th day. Lower titers (1:5 to 1:10) of IF were detected in sera obtained on the 4th to 8th days after administration of virus. Peak titers of IF in respiratory tract secretions were accompanied by a 100- to > 1,000-fold reduction in the levels of AV-IBR present in the secretions. Serum antibody was not detected prior to the 8th day after administration of AV-IBR. Calves which received AV-IBR by the IN route 72 or 96 hr earlier were refractory to challenge with virulent infectious bovine rhinotracheitis virus (IBR), whereas calves receiving AV-IBR 18 or 40 hr earlier became clinically ill following challenge. The temporal association between appearance of IF in respiratory tract secretions and onset of protection against challenge suggests a cause and effect relationship. No IF was detected in either nasal secretions or sera of calves receiving modified IBR virus by intramuscular injection. Following subsequent IN challenge of these calves, IF was detected in nasal secretions as early as 24 hr postchallenge and was maintained at titers of 1:40 to 1:80 for approximately 4 days, even in the absence of virus recovery. Greater ease of local IF induction with IBR virus in calves previously sensitized with that virus is suggested.
