Two patients with advanced hairy cell leukemia and pancytopenia responded successfully to intramuscular injections of recombinant interferon-beta, with normalisation of blood counts. One of the patients had developed resistance to interferon-alpha. The in-vivo response was predicted by in-vitro studies showing a beneficial effect of IFN-beta on erythropoiesis in cell cultures derived from these patients.
