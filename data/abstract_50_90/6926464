1137 newborn infants in the towns of Harstad and Tromso were examined for Staphylococcus aureus. The children were followed for two months after birth, and 10% showed signs of infection. The first symptom occurred on the average on the ninth day of life, while the average stay in the maternity ward was six days. 85% of those being regarded on clinical grounds as infected with S aureus showed growth of this bacterium on cultivation of the specimens taken. Over 80% of the strains were resistant to penicillin G/V and approximately 11% resistant to fucidic acid. Resistance to other antibiotics was not found to present any problem. A survey of staphylococcal infections among the newborn should include both the stay in the maternity ward and the first week at home.
