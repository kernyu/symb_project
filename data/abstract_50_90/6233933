Seventy-three strains of Y. enterocolitica isolated from patients with acute gastrointestinal diseases and from wild and synathropic rodents in the Krasnodar region were studied for sensitivity to 12 antibiotics. The strains were shown to be sensitive or moderately sensitive to aminoglycosides. Their MIC for the predominating majority of the strains ranged from 0.4 to 6.4 micrograms/ml. Gentamicin and streptomycin proved to be the most active. Then follow kanamycin, tobramycin and sisomicin. However, some strains were resistant to kanamycin and streptomycin. The strains of the microorganism causing gastric yersiniasis had moderate sensitivity to tetracycline and moderate resistance to rifampicin, chloramphenicol and polymyxin B. All the strains were highly resistant to penicillin, which was characteristic of Y. enterocolitica.
