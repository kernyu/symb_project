Miconazole2, a synthetic imidazole derivative, is a new topical antifungal agent for use in the local treatment of vaginal, and skin and nail infections due to yeasts and dermatophytes. It is particularly active against Candida spp., Trichophyton spp., Epidermophyton spp., Microsporum spp. and Pityrosporon orbiculare (Malassezia furfur), but also possesses some activity against Gram-positive bacteria. In vaginal candidiasis, miconazole vaginal cream has produced higher cure rates than conventional nystatin vaginal tablets or amphotericin B vaginal cream. There have been no published comparisons with nystatin vaginal cream or foaming vaginal tablets - the nystatin dosage form preferred by some clinicians. The vaginal cream has also achieved a cure where previous nystatin or natamycin therapy had failed. Miconazole has proved equally effective in both Candida and dermatophyte infections of the skin, but as yet there have been no published comparisons with other antifungal agents. However, it has been successfully used in chronic skin infections which had not responded satisfactorily to other agents such as natamycin and pecilocin. Preliminary experience with oral and intravenous miconazole therapy in systemic candidiasis is promising. Miconazole preparations are well accepted and tolerated.
