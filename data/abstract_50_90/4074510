One hundred and ninety-four anaerobic bacteria isolated from clinical sources were tested by agar dilution technique against seven antimicrobial agents. A comparison with international literature, generally used for selecting appropriate antimicrobial drug showed concordant patterns of susceptibility in the case of Cocci gram-positive, Clostridia, Fusobacterium and other species of Bacteroides excluded B. fragilis group. For these strains we did not found any particular problem in the choice of the therapeutic treatment. In the case of Bacteroides fragilis and B. fragilis group our data confirmed the widespread of resistance to clindamycin and cefoxitin. When the cefoxitin and clindamycin resistance is confirmed by in vitro tests, the piperacillin represent a valid alternative considering the safety profile compared to chloramphenicol (no bone marrow toxicity) and to carbenicillin (no sodium load).
