The AA. evaluated the sensitivity to Fosfomycin and to other commonly used antibiotics of 105 bacterial strains isolated from hospital environment and 195 from pathological materials. They also studied the problem of bacterial resistence to Fosfomycin considering the frequency of "inner colonies" and of bacterial cross-resistance to other antibiotics.
