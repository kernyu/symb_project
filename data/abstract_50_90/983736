In 15 cats, anesthetized with chloralose and curarized, liver hemodynamics and liver function were followed during graded hypoxic hypoxemia. Hepatic arterial and intrahepatic portal venous conductance were not influenced by hypoxia, whereas severe hypoxemia increased gastrointestinal conductance. Total liver blood flow remained constant and hypoxemia was compensated for by an increase in hepatic extraction of oxygen approaching 100%. Only when the hepatic venous pO2 fell below 5-10 mmHg did hypoxemia decrease liver function. The results indicate that the sinusoidal perfusion is homogeneous.
