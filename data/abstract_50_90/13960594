A total of 48 ring chlorinated pyrimidines was screened against strains of five fungi by the disc-plate method, in liquid culture, and for activity of the vapors of the compounds. Correlations of the results obtained by the three methods were made, and structure to activity relationships were discussed. The outstanding members of this series were found to be 2,4,5-trichloropyrimidine, 4,5,6-trichloropyrimidine, and 2-chloromethyl-4,5,6-trichloropyrimidine, in this screening system.
