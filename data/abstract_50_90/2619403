Levorin and candicidin represent close mixtures of heptaenic components. Their physicochemical and biological properties were also close. The antibiotics showed similar diffusive properties in their assay by the agar diffusion method. This made it possible to determine activity of the Soviet levorin standard by the International candicidin standard. For defining the levorin unit in the international units of candicidin, a scaling ratio of 9 was proposed.
