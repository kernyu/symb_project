Streptomycin (SM)- or erythromycin (EM)-resistant lysogenic and non-lysogenic substrains were produced from two Staphylococcus aureus L-form strains lysogenic for different prophages, namely, EMT-L (prophage alpha) and 209P (prophage beta). Cells of these L-form substrains were fused in various combinations using polyethylene glycol (PEG), and the frequency of recombinants selected as double resistance to both SM and EM and the prophage types of these recombinants were examined. In all the combinations, the frequency of recombinants was greater when the cells were treated with PEG than when they were not, and the difference was statistically significant (p less than 0.01) in 13 combinations. Combination between the lysogenic SM-resistant EMT-L substrain [EMT(Smr-alpha)] and lysogenic EM-resistant 209P-L substrain [209P(Emr-beta)] and the reverse combination, between 209P(Smr-beta) and EMT(Emr-alpha), resulted in a majority of recombinants harboring prophage beta. The former combination yielded recombinants that all held both prophage alpha and beta.
