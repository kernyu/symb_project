From the cultures of Streptomyces violaceoniger, strain Tu 96, two new lipophilic antibiotics, Lysolipin I and Lysolipin X were isolated. The latter one is chemically unstable and is easily transformed to Lysolipin I. The deeply yellow Lysolipin I has a molecular formula C29H24CINO11. It was characterized by the ir, uv, H-nmr and 13C-nmr spectra, which make a quinone structure very probable. Lysolipin I is active against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. However, enterobacteriae are only inhibited in high dilution, when the membrane permeation is damaged. Lysolipin I acts lytically against bacterial cells. Its activity is decreased by several lipids. The site of action is the biosynthesis of bacterial cell walls, an interaction with the carrier lipid for mureine intermediates being probable.
