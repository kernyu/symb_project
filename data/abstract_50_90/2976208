Neisseria gonorrhoeae isolates were studied to determine their patterns of antimicrobial susceptibility and possible chemotherapeutic implications. Of 370 consecutive isolates, 32 (8.7%) were penicillinase-producing N. gonorrhoeae (PPNG). The remaining 338 were subjected to disk-diffusion tests, and those apparently resistant to penicillin, tetracycline, or spectinomycin were tested by an agar-dilution method. The dilution test showed that 5.4% (20/370) were penicillin-resistant, non-PPNG strains, of which 100%, 90%, and 45% were also resistant to tetracycline, cefoxitin, and erythromycin, respectively. No resistance to spectinomycin or ceftriaxone was demonstrated, although there was an association between minimum inhibitor concentrations (MICs) of penicillin of greater than or equal to 1.0 microgram/ml and increased MICs of ceftriaxone. The overall incidence of penicillin resistant isolates, including PPNG, was 14.1% (52/370). Of the 20 penicillin-resistant, non-PPNG strains, all were also resistant to tetracycline, and another 21 exhibited tetracycline resistance but were sensitive to penicillin. The in-vitro data suggested that: (1) neither penicillin, tetracycline, nor cefoxitin were acceptable drugs for routine treatment of gonorrhea in our population during the study period; (2) spectinomycin and ceftriaxone continue to demonstrate adequate in-vitro activity against N. gonorrhoeae despite increasing in-vitro resistance to penicillin; and (3) non-plasmid-mediated resistance to penicillin may predict future resistance to ceftriaxone.
