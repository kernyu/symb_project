The susceptibility of urinary tract Escherichia coli isolates to cotrimoxazole, sulphonamide, trimethoprim, and ampicillin was monitored over an 11-year period. A trend in increasing resistance to cotrimoxazole and trimethoprim was observed, but there was no comparable alteration in sulphonamide resistance. Ampicillin resistance was high at the beginning of the survey period and continued to rise.
