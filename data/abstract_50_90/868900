Bacterial resistance to aminoglycoside antibiotics occurs by a variety of mechanisms. In clinical situations the most common mechanism is plasmid-determined modification of the drug that leads to a block of transport of the antibiotic into the cell. Amikacin, a semisynthetic aminoglycoside, is effective against a number of resistant strains because it has fewer sites of modification.
