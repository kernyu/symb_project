Aspoxicillin (ASPC), a new penicillin for injection, was evaluated for its efficacy and safety in 29 children with bacterial infection (Table 1), and the following results were obtained. MICs of ASPC to 26 strains of isolated organisms are shown in Table 2. MICs to 4 out of 13 strains of H. influenzae were higher than 6.25 micrograms/ml. MICs to 5 strains of S. pneumoniae were lower than 0.78 microgram/ml and 1 out of 3 strains of S. aureus and 1 strain of E. coli showed higher MICs than 100 micrograms/ml. ASPC was administered in 3 or 4 divided doses at a daily dosage ranging from 21 to 98 mg/kg by 30 minutes drip infusion or intravenous injection to 29 patients (16 cases of pneumonia, 8 cases of tonsillitis, 3 cases of bronchitis, 1 case of urinary tract infection, 1 case of impetigo) and the following clinical results were obtained: excellent; 11 cases, good; 11 cases, fair; 3 cases, poor; 1 case. The overall efficacy rate was 85% (Table 3, 4). No clinical side-effects were observed in any of the patients. Leukopenia was noted in 1 case. Slight elevation of GOT and GPT was noted in 2 cases, and minimal elevation of GOT was observed in other 2 cases (Table 5). These data suggest that ASPC is an useful new antibiotic in the treatment of children with susceptible bacterial infection and may be used as the first choice antibiotic for the treatment of respiratory tract infection in children.
