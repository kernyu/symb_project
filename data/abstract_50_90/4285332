Takano, Kouichi (Chas. Pfizer & Co., Inc., Terre Haute, Ind.), Joel Warren, Keith E. Jensen, and Alan L. Neal. Nucleic acid resistance to viral infection. J. Bacteriol. 90:1542-1547. 1965.-Administration of nonviral nucleic acids to mice increased their resistance to a subsequent infection with influenza or encephalomyocarditis viruses. Injection of ribonucleic acid or deoxyribonucleic acid by peripheral routes did not modify susceptibility to intranasal infection. Lung tissue extracts from animals previously treated with yeast nucleic acid inhibited the growth of vaccinia and influenza viruses. The protective effect of exogenous nucleic acids persisted in mice for several days, but gradually diminished to undetectable levels.
