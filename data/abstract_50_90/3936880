The epidemiology of meningococcal infections that arose in England and Wales during the period 1912-1983 has been reviewed. The outcome of meningococcal disease was dramatically improved when treatment with sulphonamides was introduced. With the emergence of sulphonamide-resistant strains, penicillin has become the drug of choice. Despite modern treatment, however, the mortality ratio during the last 30 years has remained about the same. Prompt diagnosis as well as immediate and effective treatment are cardinal needs. Even so, when infection is overwhelming there is little chance of saving the patient. Immunisation is probably the only effective answer but as yet there is not an effective vaccine to prevent group B infections which predominate in this country.
