In vitro susceptibility of 256 C. jejuni/coli-isolates to 23 antimicrobial agents were tested by an agar-diffusion technique and by determination of the minimal inhibition concentrations. The isolates tested were highly susceptible to tetracycline, the aminoglycosides, chloramphenicol, nitrofurantoin, and pipemic acid. They were resistant to cephalosporins (except Cefotaxime) and penicillin and its derivatives. About 6% of the isolates were resistant to erythromycin (MIC 4 micrograms/ml) and about 15% to nalidixic acid (MIC 40 micrograms/ml). The significance of the resistance patterns of C. jejuni/coli strains for therapy and taxonomic problems was discussed.
