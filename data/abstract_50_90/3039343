5-Fluorouracil, 5-fluorouridine (FUrd), 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine (FdUrd), 5-fluorocytidine (FCyd), 5-fluoro-2'-deoxycytidine (FdCyd), 5-trifluoro-2'-deoxythymidine (F3dThd), and the 5'-monophosphates and 3',5'-cyclic monophosphates thereof were found to inhibit thymidine kinase-deficient (TK-) mutant strains of herpes simplex virus (HSV) at a much lower concentration than the wild-type (TK+) HSV strains. Other 5-substituted 2'-deoxyuridines that have previously been recognized as potent thymidylate synthase inhibitors behaved in a similar fashion. The activity of FdUrd, FdCyd, F3dThd, and their 3',5'-cyclic monophosphates against TK-HSV was readily reversed by 2'-deoxythymidine (dThd) but not by 2'-deoxyuridine (dUrd). These compounds also inhibited the incorporation of [6-3H]dUrd into DNA at a concentration which was up to 5 orders of magnitude lower than the concentration at which the incorporation of [methyl-3H] dThd was inhibited. Thus, while not being a target for the well established anti-HSV compounds in TK+HSV-infected cells, thymidylate synthase appears to be an important target in TK-HSV-infected cells. In addition to dTMP synthase, TK-HSV-infected cells appear to reveal other therapeutically exploitable targets such as OMP decarboxylase (towards pyrazofurin), CTP synthase (towards carbodine and its cyclopentenyl analogue), dihydrofolate reductase (towards methotrexate), and S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase (towards neplanocins).
