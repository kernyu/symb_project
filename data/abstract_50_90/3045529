Natural killer (NK) cells were eliminated with rabbit anti-Asialo GM1 (anti-ASGM1) serum to test the kinetics and location of bone marrow cell (BMC) rejection. Anti-ASGM1 serum was injected intravenously in mice at various times before or after irradiation (8.6 Gy) and transfer of parental-strain or allogeneic BMC. Growth of BMC was determined by measuring splenic 5-iodo-2'-deoxyuridine-125I incorporation 5 days after cell transfer. Anti-ASGM1 serum weakened hybrid resistance even if injected intravenously as late as 24 h post-BMC transfer and even in recipients injected with polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid so as to boost NK activity. If regenerating spleen cells (higher rate of cell cycling) were used as donor cells instead of BMC, the length of time required for rejection was unaffected. Anti-ASGM1 serum injected intravenously rapidly inhibited splenic NK activity and lung clearance of YAC-1 tumor cells, but when injected intratracheally, it only inhibited lung NK activity. Thus, BMC rejection occurs in the hematopoietic tissue and requires at least 24 h.
