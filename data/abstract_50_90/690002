Four N-ethyl derivatives of kanamycin A and five N-ethyl derivatives of kanamycin B were synthesized. The antimicrobial activity of N-ethyl kanamycin derivatives was determined against aminoglycoside-sensitive and resistant organisms. The structure-activity relationship of these compounds is discussed with reference to the activity of N-acyl kanamycin derivatives.
