The incidence of infection with penicillinase-producing Neisseria gonorrhoeae (PPNG) reported to the Laboratory Centre for Disease Control in Ottawa has steadily increased since the first Canadian isolation of such a strain in 1976. As of September 1980 a total of 66 PPNG isolates had been referred for biological and genetic characterization as well as for central documentation of the epidemiologic aspects of each case. Over 90% of the infections were firmly traced to patients or contacts who had acquired the infection abroad; this indicates that Canada does not, as yet, have an epidemic focus of PPNG infection. This report includes a synopsis of the biological characteristics of these isolates and an analysis of the results of primary antibiotic treatment that illustrates the importance of considering spectinomycin as the antibiotic of choice for PPNG infections.
