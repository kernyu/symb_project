Streptomyces sannanensis KC-7038 used for the production of sannamycins A and B has also produced another antibiotic sannamycin C, in the culture broth. Physico-chemical characterization revealed that sannamycin C is a new aminoglycoside antibiotic having 6-N-methylpurpurosamine C and 2-deoxy-3-epi-fortamine. Its 4-N-glycyl derivative indicated inhibitory activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria containing aminoglycoside resistant strains.
