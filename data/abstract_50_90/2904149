Analysis of a genetic cross of Plasmodium falciparum and of independent parasite isolates from Southeast Asia, Africa, and South America indicates that resistance to pyrimethamine, an antifolate used in the treatment of malaria, results from point mutations in the gene encoding dihydrofolate reductase-thymidylate synthase (EC 1.5.1.3 and EC 2.1.1.45, respectively). Parasites having a mutation from Thr-108/Ser-108 to Asn-108 in DHFR-TS are resistant to the drug. The Asn-108 mutation occurs in a region analogous to the C alpha-helix bordering the active site cavity of bacterial, avian, and mammalian enzymes. Additional point mutations (Asn-51 to Ile-51 and Cys-59 to Arg-59) are associated with increased pyrimethamine resistance and also occur at sites expected to border the active site cavity. Analogies with known inhibitor/enzyme structures from other organisms suggest that the point mutations occur where pyrimethamine contacts the enzyme and may act by inhibiting binding of the drug.
