Flumequine (1 g/l) was administered to healthy young chickens in the drinking water for 5 days. A transient increase in the incidence of resistance to flumequine (4 micrograms/ml) was recorded in faecal coliform isolates after administration. Cross-resistance with nalidixic acid was demonstrated, but there was no evidence of cross-resistance to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, kanamycin, streptomycin, sulphadiazide, tetracycline and trimethoprim.
