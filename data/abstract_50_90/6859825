Possible formation of auxotrophs and changing of the antibiotic production property connected with resistance to antibiotics of different modes of action were studied in Streptomyces cremeus subsp. tobramycini producing the nebramycin complex of 2-desoxystreptamine derivatives. Four hundred and five spontaneous and 1800 gamma-radiation induced antibiotic resistant mutants of the culture were studied. The frequency of the auxotrophs was shown to be increasing. Correlation between formation of strains producing monocomponent aminoglycosides and antibiotic resistance was observed. The frequency of mutants with preferable synthesis of the tobramycin component among strr-, rifr- and rubr-mutants was 3--10 times higher than among the sensitive portion of the population when total selection was used. Therefore, the spontaneous mutation of antibiotic resistance is selective with respect to both isolation of auxotrophs and strains producing separate aminoglycoside antibiotics.
