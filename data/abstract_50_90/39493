Antimicrobial susceptibility testing of pneumococci is now essential to monitor for the presence of resistance to agents such as the penicillins, macrolides, lincomycins, chloramphenicol, and tetracycline. In this study, clinical isolates of a selection of resistant South African strains were tested for antimicrobial susceptibility by minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) determination and by a modified Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion technique, using Mueller-Hinton medium supplemented with 5% horse blood. Disk diffusion breakpoints were determined for penicillin G, erythromycin, clindamycin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, and rifampin. Reliable results were obtained on disk diffusion for all these agents except for penicillin G. With 6-mug penicillin G disks, zones of strains with intermediate penicillin susceptibility overlapped those of sensitive and resistant strains. With 5-mug methicillin disks, clearer separation of strains based on susceptibility to penicillin G occurred. Strains with zones of <35 mm around penicillin G disks and <25 mm around methicillin disks should have penicillin G MICs determined to confirm their resistance to penicillin G. In view of the potential for pneumococci to be resistant to the agents used in this study, antimicrobial susceptibility of all clinically significant isolates should be determined.
