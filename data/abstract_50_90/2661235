Present data available on ceftriaxone (Rocephin) dealing with microbiology, pharmacokinetics (long half-life, tissue penetration ability, tissue concentration present during vulnerable period, etc.), results of clinical trials, and world-wide experience seem to be in favor of ceftriaxone as the antimicrobial of choice for single-dose antibiotic prophylaxis in abdominal and biliary surgery. Single-dose surgical prophylaxis is cost-effective, has a low rate of adverse drug events, and so far does not increase danger of resistance.
