Kainate-lesioned hippocampal slices provide an excellent system for examining the electrophysiological properties of non-cultured glial cells without interfering signals from surrounding neurons. Intracellular recordings in the intensely gliotic CA3 region indicated that the resting membrane potential and input resistance of these reactive glial cells were similar to those reported for non-reactive astrocytes. Dye-coupling typical of astrocytes was also demonstrated amongst these cells, and was considerably reduced by cytoplasmic acidification. Occasionally these cells demonstrated spontaneous, rhythmic oscillations of membrane potential associated with large changes in whole cell input resistance. The action potentials reported in cultured astrocytes were not observed in reactive glial cells, even under conditions that maximize the observation of Ca2(+)-dependent responses. This suggests that reactive glial cells in this preparation have either no voltage-activated Ca2+ channels or a very low density of such channels. These cells also lack a bicarbonate conductance, but they do appear to have an apamin-sensitive conductance, possibly a Ca2(+)-activated gK.
