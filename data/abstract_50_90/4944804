During 10 months, 155 isolates of Serratia marcescens were cultured from 105 patients, of whom 49 were considered to have significant infection. The 155 isolates were typed by bacteriocin sensitivity, and 137 (88.4%) were assigned to 37 provisional bacteriocin groups; 18 isolates were nontypable. No major outbreaks of nosocomial infection were demonstrable; however, there were four chronologically separate minor episodes of cross-infection that involved two or three patients per room or unit, respectively.
