We studied the effect of the duration of diabetic state on insulin action in skeletal muscle by measuring insulin binding, 2-deoxyglucose uptake, and intracellular glucose metabolism in isolated soleus muscles from streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. Insulin binding to soleus muscles from diabetic rats was increased over that from controls. Glucose transport activity was determined by measuring the 2-deoxyglucose uptake at the concentration of 1 mmol/L at 25 degrees C. In the rats with diabetes of one week duration, insulin-stimulated 2-deoxyglucose uptake was not impaired, whereas basal 2-deoxyglucose uptake was decreased. However, the diabetic rats with two weeks duration revealed a 35.6% decrease in the insulin-stimulated 2-deoxyglucose uptake. Furthermore, four week duration of diabetic state led to a 60% decrease both in basal and insulin-stimulated 2-deoxyglucose uptake. Total glucose utilization was estimated as the total amount of glucose incorporated into muscle and lactate released into the medium following incubation at 37 degrees C, with 5 mmol/L glucose. The diabetic rats with one week duration did not demonstrate any changes in total glucose utilization both in basal and insulin-stimulated state. However more than two weeks duration of diabetes led to a 30% to 35% decrease both in basal and insulin-stimulated total glucose utilization, similar to the findings in the 2-deoxyglucose uptake study. We concluded that prolonged insulinopenia led to decreased glucose transport and intracellular glucose metabolism and resulted in insulin resistance in skeletal muscles.
