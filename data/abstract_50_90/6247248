In vitro recombination techniques were used to construct a series of new cloning vehicles with genes of the tryptophan (trp) operon of Escherichia coli as selective marker. To construct these plasmids we have made a restriction cleavage map of the trp operon for the enzymes AosI, AvaI, BglI, BglII, HindIII, HpaI, PvuII, SalI, SstI and XhoI. The constructed plasmids pHP39, pEP392, pEP3921 and pEP3923 are derived from the amplifiable plasmid pBR345 and carry two or more genes of the trp operon, which are controlled by the trp regulatory elements. Plasmid pEP3921 (7.0 kb) carries intact trpE and trpA genes and contains single BglII and SstI sites in trpE, a single HindIII site located between trpE and trpA, and single EcoRI, SalI and XhoI sites located outside the trp genes. Plasmid pEP121 (12 kb) is similar to pEP3921, but has an extra selective marker conferring bacterial resistance to ampicillin. Plasmid pEP3923 (7.4 kb) comprises intact trpB and trpA genes and single BglII, HindIII, EcoRI, SalI and XhoI sites. Plasmids pHP39 (9.8 kb) and pEP392 (9.8 kb) carry an intact trp operon and have two and one EcoRI site, respectively. Plasmid pHP3 (18 kb) carries an intact trp operon and markers for tetracycline and ampicillin resistance.
