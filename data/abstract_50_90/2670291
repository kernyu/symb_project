The sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine combination has not been recommended for the prophylaxis of malaria since 1985 following serious accidents in the USA. However, this drug is worth considering for treatment since it has the advantage over mefloquine of being cheaper, having fewer side effects and it avoids using mefloquine. A study of Plasmodium falciparum resistance to Fansidar should be carried out on cases imported to France to determine an adapted utilisation of this drug. This would be an appreciable advantage for tropical Africa.
