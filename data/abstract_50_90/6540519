A memorandum based on the report of the World Health Organization Working Group on Antimicrobial Resistance is presented. National and international surveillance of antibiotic resistance is needed for improvement of antibiotic prescribing, for formulation of government policy on antibiotic use in humans and animals, and for encouraging responsible marketing and promotion by antibiotic manufacturers. Surveillance should include sensitivity tests of human pathogens and periodic monitoring of fecal flora of healthy persons. Guidelines for rational antibiotic use in hospitals include basing antibiotic selection on tested or expected sensitivity, using an agent with as narrow a spectrum as possible, choosing appropriate dosage and route, and use of the drug for the shortest possible time. Both therapeutic and prophylactic antibiotic use are addressed in the guidelines. Use of a limited formulary and use of pharmacy records to monitor antibiotic consumption are recommended. Hospital regulation of contact between pharmaceutical industry representatives and physicians is suggested. Areas are identified for bacteriologic, clinical, epidemiologic, and health-services research to improve antibiotic use. Surveillance of bacterial resistance should be coordinated worldwide. National formularies for antibiotics should be developed, and nonphysicians who distribute antibiotics should be trained in their proper use.
