Group H streptococcal strains Challis and WE4 were lysogenized with a bacteriophage isolated from strain Channon, after which their capacity for transformation to streptomycin and rifampin resistance was reduced by three orders of magnitude. The probable reason is the inability of the lysogenized strains to bind deoxyribonucleic acid irreversibly, even though they exhibit earlier stages of competence development during a competence regimen.
