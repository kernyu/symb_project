The literature and experimental data on stability of resistance ot benzylpenicillin, streptomycin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, kanamycin and methicillin in staphylococci stored for prolonged periods of time on artificial nutrient media were systematized. When the staphylococcal cultures were not in contact iwth the antibiotics for 5 to 18 months, sensitive cells to separate drugs were detected in 51.0--67.4 per cent of the strains. The number of such cells in the populations of some strains ranged from 1 to 100.0 per cent. The effect of the resistance multiplicity on the stability of resistance to benzylpenicillin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol and erythromycin was not observed.
