Escherichia coli devoid of glutathione (because of transposon insertions in the gshA gene) has normal resistance to H2O2, cumene hydroperoxide, heat, or ionizing radiation. Intracellular glutathione thus does not protect E. coli from such lethal oxidative damage. The use of gshA::Tn10 mutants also revealed a glutathione-independent, H2O2-inducible resistance to N-ethylmaleimide.
