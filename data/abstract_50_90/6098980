The intra- and extracellular concentrations of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) in cell line CHO-K1, sensitive (clone 773) and resistant to cytotoxic action of ethidium bromide (EBr), colchicine (Cr) and actinomycin D (ADr), as well as the amount of cAMP in response to isoproterenol, 10% serum and ethidium bromide (EB) in these cells were studied. The increased level of cAMP in EBr- and, Cr-cells, and the decreased one--in ADr cells was found as compared with sensitive cells. The amount of cAMP extruded in the surrounding medium was lower for EBr- and Cr-cells and higher for ADr-cells, in comparison with sensitive cells. All the variants of resistant cells were characterized by a less intensive but a longer reaction for isoproterenol, as compared with sensitive cells. In all the investigated variants 10% serum induced a remarkable increase in the intracellular cAMP by the 2nd hour after their insignificant decrease. 1 mcg/ml concentration of EBr increased intracellular cAMP only in 773-cells. The rules changing the cAMP level to isoproterenol and EB2; are determined by differences in reaction of adenylate cyclase, as it has been demonstrated for the 773- and EBr-cells.
