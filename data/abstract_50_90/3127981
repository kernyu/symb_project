Out of six isolates of coccidia of the species Eimeria tenella, obtained in the years 1984 and 1985 on farms with a stationary occurrence of coccidiosis, five were found to have reduced sensitivity or resistance to monensin. Neither were these isolates sensitive to further monovalent ionophorous anticoccidials narasin and salinomycin. The bivalent ionophorous anticoccidial lasalocid controlled five isolates completely, but for one its effectiveness was reduced. An isolate obtained on a farm with long-term absence of coccidiosis was sensitive to all anticoccidial drugs.
