Econazole-nitrate is a new potent antifungal drug with a broad spectrum against dermatophytes, yeasts and moulds; in addition it is effective against gram-positive bacteria. Econazole nitrate was tested in-vitro for antifungal and anti-microbial properties. In an open trial 75 patients were treated with a 1 percent econazole cream. Cure was achieved in tinea pedis in 91 percent; in tinea genitocruralis in 100 percent and in tinea corporis in 92 percent. The remainder were greatly improved. 22 patients with erythrasma were cured within 3 weeks.
