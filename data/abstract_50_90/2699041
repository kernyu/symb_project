A 6-MDa plasmid (pMQV10), carrying cholesterol hydroxylase and streptomycin-resistance genes, from a gram-positive strain of Micrococcus sps., (RJ6) has been successfully transformed in gram-negative Escherichia coli K12 C600. pMQV10 is maintained stably and expresses its drug resistance in the new host.
