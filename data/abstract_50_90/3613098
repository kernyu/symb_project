Cefuzoname (CZON), a new semisynthetic cephalospolin antibiotic, was administered intravenously at a dose of 1.0 g twice a day for 14 days to 20 patients with complicated urinary tract infections and the therapeutic efficacy of the drug and safety were evaluated. The results obtained were summarized as follows: 1. After 5 days, clinical results were excellent in 7, moderate in 3 and poor in 9 cases. The overall effectiveness rate was 52.6%. Bacteriologically, 24 out of 32 isolated strains were susceptible to this drug, but 8 strains were found to be resistant. 2. After treatment, clinical results were excellent in 6, moderate in 3 and poor in 10 cases. The overall effectiveness was 47.4%. In bacteriological results of 32 isolated strains, 26 strains were eradicated and 6 strains persisted. 3. Among 20 cases treated none showed subjective or objective symptoms of side effects. Noted as clinical laboratory test abnormalities were eosinophilia in 1 case after 5 days, increase of S-GOT, gamma-GTP, and K in 1 case, and increase of S-creatinine in 1 case at the termination of treatment. All of these abnormalities were mild and normal values were restored soon after at the termination of the treatment.
