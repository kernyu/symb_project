The effect of mecillinam, a beta-lactam antibiotic that specifically binds penicillin-binding protein 2 of Escherichia coli, causes transition from rod to coccal shape, and inhibits cell division in sensitive cells, has been tested on three different E. coli temperature-sensitive cell division mutants. At the nonpermissive temperature, the antibiotic allows an increase in cell number for strains BUG6 and AX655 but not for AX621. In strain AX655, the cell division stimulation was observed only if the antibiotic was added immediately after shifting to the nonpermissive temperature, whereas in BUG6, the rise in cell number was observed also when mecillinam was added after 90 min of incubation at the nonpermissive temperature. In all cases, cell division began occurring 30 min after addition of the antibiotic. Mecillinam had no effect on division of dnaA, dnaB temperature-sensitive mutants or on division of BUG6 derivatives made resistant to this antibiotic. Other beta-lactam antibiotics such as penicillin, ampicillin, cephalexin, and piperacillin and non beta-lactam antibiotics such as fosfomycin, teichomycin, and vancomycin that inhibit cell wall synthesis did not show any effect on cell division for any of the mutants. The response of the three cell division mutants to mecillinam is interpreted in terms of a recently proposed model for shape regulation in bacteria.
