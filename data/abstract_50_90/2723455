Strain D366, a clinical isolate of Enterococcus faecium, is resistant (minimum inhibitory concentration [MIC] 32 mg/L) to vancomycin. When exponential-phase cultures were exposed to half the MIC of vancomycin, a lag of 3-4 h occurred before growth resumed. Cells preexposed to 1/2 MICs of vancomycin did not show any lag. Pregrowth of D366 with vancomycin caused resistance to all glycopeptides tested. Pregrowth in vancomycin resulted in synthesis of a 3.95-kDa cytoplasmic-membrane-associated protein. This protein was correlated with resistance in mutants with high-level resistance, in the presence of NaCl, which inhibited the activity of vancomycin, and when several glycopeptides with varying activities were tested. Vancomycin-grown cells appeared abnormal and lysed at a much slower rate than did normal cells. We conclude that (1) vancomycin resistance in D366 is inducible; (2) resistance is correlated with the synthesis of 39.5-kDa cytoplasmic membrane protein; and (3) this protein play an additional role in the inhibition of normal lytic functions.
