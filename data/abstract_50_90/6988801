A study of 100 cases of malaria in France, 98 of which were imported, shows the strong predominance (83%) of Plasmodium falciparum and of contamination in Africa (86%). The reasons why malaria is rare among tourists returning from Asia are given. The risk of re-introduction of the disease into France seems to be slight, especially for P. falciparum. Chemoprophylaxis is easy when aminoquinolines can be recommended, but much more complicated otherwise, the reasons for failure being the lack of effect of other drugs on pre-erythrocytic forms, resistance to chemotherapy and lack of information or carelessness.
