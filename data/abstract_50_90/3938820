Sub-MIC range of 8 kinds of beta-lactam antibiotics and 3 kinds of aminoglycoside antibiotics against strain of Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from clinical source were determined by nephlometic method, and following results were obtained. When 10 strains of S. aureus tested to ampicillin (ABPC), hetacillin (IPABPC), mecillinam (MPC), cephalexin (CEX), cefotaxime (CTX), latamoxef (LMOX), cefatrizine (CFT), cephapirin (CEPR), gentamicin (GM), dibekacin (DKB) and amikacin (AMK), ratio of MIC to MAC were 36.8, 53.6, 156.8, 29.6, 61.6, 34.4, 50.0, 111.2, 9.2, 20.0 and 13.6, respectively. When 10 strains of K. pneumoniae tested to MPC, CEX, CTX, LMOX, CFT, CEPR, GM, DKB and AMK, ratio of MIC to MAC were 409.6, 10.4, 34.4, 123.2, 39.2, 167.2, 5.2, 5.6 and 13.2, respectively. When 10 strains of P. aeruginosa tested against CTX, LMOX, GM, DKB and AMK, ratio of MIC to MAC were 16.8, 38.4, 6.8, 3.2 and 10.4, respectively.
