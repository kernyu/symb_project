In contrast to prior experience in northeastern Brazil, three of four Shigella flexneri strains recently isolated from patients with acute inflammatory diarrhea in this setting were found to be resistant to sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim. The resistant strains contained large, different plasmids, two of which were transferred with sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim resistance to Escherichia coli K-12 recipient strains.
