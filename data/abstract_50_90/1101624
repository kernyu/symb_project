Toxicity, clearance, and therapeutic effectiveness of intravitreal vancomycin hydrochloride injection in experimentally induced staphylococcal endophthalmitis were evaluated. Vancomycin was found to be nontoxic in a single, 1 mg/0.1 ml intravitreal dose. Therapeutic levels of vancomycin were present in the vitreous for over 72 hours and in the aqueous during a period from 6 to 48 hours after injection. Injection of a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus produced a panophthalmitis in our systemically treated controls, whereas in the rabbits treated by intraocular injection, the course of the infection was significantly altered.
