A historic introduction reviews the start of DDS (diaminodiphenylsulphone) therapy in leprosy, stressing the fact that, far after the start of combined therapy in tuberculosis, leprosy continued to be treated with monotherapy of DDS. Reports about resistance of M. leprae to DDS initiated a review of policy. A complete breakthrough toward combined therapy started after 1962, when Shepard introduced mousefootpad inoculation of M. leprae to be used for therapeutic trials. Full attention is given to Freerksen's trial in Malta where combined treatment with rifampicin, INH, prothionamide, and DDS were given for 2 years only to all patients, while at resurvey after 4 years no relapse was found. The applicability of short-term combined therapy for endemic areas is discussed.
