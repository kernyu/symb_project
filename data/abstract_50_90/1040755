An agar dilution method was used to determine the in vitro sensitivity of different Pseudomonas and Aeromonas species to sulphonamide, tetracycline, colistin, gentamicin, tobramycin, amplicillin, carbenicillin, and cephalothin. P. aeruginosa was generally sensitive to carbenicillin, colistin, tobramycin, and gentamicin. P. putida and P. fluorescens were generally resistant to beta-lactam antibodies but sensitive to gentamicin and tobramycin. P. cepacia and P. maltophilia were mostly resistant to colistin, gentamicin and tobramycin. Other Pseudomonas species were usually more sensitive to the antibodies tested. Strains of Aeromonas hydrophila were mostly resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics but sensitive to other antibiotics, while strains of A. shigelloides were very sensitive to all antibiotics tested.
