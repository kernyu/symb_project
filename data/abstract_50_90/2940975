Methicillin resistance (Mecr) was transduced into a methicillin-susceptible variant of the Mecr donor Staphylococcus epidermidis BS10. UV irradiation of phage stimulated Mecr transduction frequency. If loss of Cd and Hg ion resistance occurred in this recipient, or if the three markers Mecr, Cdr, and Hgr were co-eliminated from the donor, neither strain acted as a recipient for Mecr.
