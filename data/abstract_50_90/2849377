The purpose of this study was to probe the antirhinovirus (RV) mechanism of action of MDL 20,610. Evaluation of the compound's effects on RV RNA synthesis, uncoating of neutral red-sensitized RV, plasma membrane penetration by RV, stabilization of RV against heat (56 degrees C) and low pH (5.0) inactivation, and studies with MDL 20,610-resistant RV mutants indicate that MDL 20,610 binds directly to the RV capsid with subsequent inhibition of acid-mediated virion uncoating.
