540 strains of bacteria isolated from various clinical materials comprising 440 strains of Gram negative bacilli and 100 strains of Gram positive cocci were tested for their susceptibility in vitro to Kanamycin, Gentamicin and a new aminoglycoside antibiotic Sisomicin (Ensamycin). The sensitivity pattern revealed that 68.88% of the strains were sensitive to Kanamycin, 82.9% to Gentamicin and 89.0% to Sisomicin. The effectiveness of Sisomicin is comparatively greater (6.1%) than the other two aminoglycosides. In particular a considerable number of Gentamicin resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (12.3%) were found to be sensitive to Sisomicin which is a highly desirable property. Existence of about 11% Sisomium resistant strains even before the wide usage of this antibiotic is note worthy.
