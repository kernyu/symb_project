A total of 48 strains of the soil bacterium Rhizobium japonicum were screened for their response to several widely used antibiotics. Over 60% of the strains were resistant to chloramphenicol, polymyxin B, and erythromycin, and 47% or more of the strains were resistant to neomycin and penicillin G, when tested by disk assay procedures. The most common grouping of resistances in strains was simultaneous resistance to tetracycline, penicillin G, neomycin, chloramphenicol, and streptomycin (25% of all strains tested). The occurrence of multiple drug resistance in a soil bacterium that is not a vertebrate pathogen suggests that chemotherapeutic use of antibiotics is not required for the development of multiple drug resistance.
