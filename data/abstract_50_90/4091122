The following results were obtained from the statistical studies and drug sensitivity tests of bacterial florae isolated from the urinary tract in 1981 and 1982. Of the 2,029 strains isolated from out-patients, 627 (30.9%) were gram positive cocci, 24.1% were E. coli, 9.4% were Proteus spp., 9.2% were Enterococci, 8.9% were S. epidermidis, 7.0 % were K. pneumoniae, 5.7% were P. aeruginosa and the rest were others. Of the 754 strains isolated from hospitalized patients, 276 (36.6%) were gram positive cocci, 16.8% were Enterococci, 11.4% were S. epidermidis, 11.1% were P. aeruginosa, 8.8% were Proteus spp, 7.2% were E.coli, 6.5% were K.pneumoniae and the rest were others. The number of Proteus spp., P. aeruginosa and Enterococci detected in the isolates from the out-patients and that of E.coli, K. pneumoniae and Proteus spp., detected in the isolates from the in-patients were smaller than in previous reports. More non-fermentative gram-negative bacilli and S. epidermidis were detected in the isolates from both patients were than in previous years. The major isolates i.e., 9 species, from out-patients were more susceptible to the antimicrobial agents tested. The susceptibility of TC and SBPC to major isolates was lower than in previous years. During the past two years, we have been routinely using on inpatients the so-called third generation cefem antibiotics to treat urinary tract infections. This might be why the number of isolates of gram positive cocci has increased especially isolates from inpatients.
