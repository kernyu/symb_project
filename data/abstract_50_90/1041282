Clinical effects of a newly developed aminoglycoside antibiotic lividomycin, were investigated in 13 patients suffering from respiratory infections. 1. A total of 13 patients with the following infectious diseases was treated with 1 g/day of lividomycin for 3 to 11 days (average 6.7 days): Acute pneumonia 3 cases, bronchiectasis 3 cases, acute bronchitis 5 cases, suppurative diseases of the lung 1 case, and pyothorax 1 case. As the results, the antibiotic was effective in 5 patients, moderately effective in 4 patients and ineffective in 4 patients, and thus the global effective rate was 62.9% (9/13). 2. As in the case of kanamycin, lividomycin indicated fairly good sensitivity against a total of 17 strains comprising Staphylococcus aureus (7 strains), alpha-Streptococcus (2 strains), beta-Streptococcus (3 strains), gamma-Streptococcus (1 strain), Neisseria (2 strains) and Haemophilus (2 strains) which were isolated from sputum. 3. No side effects attributable to lividomycin were observed.
