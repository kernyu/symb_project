The results of a questionnaire survey of the distribution of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in the UK and Ireland between 1982 and 1983 are reported. Information was obtained about the geographical distribution of MRSA, the units affected, the sites of isolation and the preventive measures employed. Serious clinical problems were confined to a small number of hospitals with high isolation rates of MRSA.
