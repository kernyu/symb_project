In vitro susceptibilities of 73 strains of Haemophilus influenzae isolated from clinical specimens in 1983 to various antibiotics were studied. The following antibiotics were evaluated; ampicillin (ABPC), piperacillin (PIPC), cefotaxime (CTX), cefoperazone (CPZ), ceftizoxime (CZX), cefmenoxime (CMX), latamoxef (LMOX), tetracycline (TC), doxycycline (DOXY), minocycline (MINO), chloramphenicol (CP) and erythromycin (EM). Susceptible strains to ABPC and PIPC with MICs less than 3 micrograms/ml were 80.3 and 84.1%, respectively. With this break point of MIC, all strains showed susceptibility to CPZ, CZX, and CMX, but resistant strains were observed in 1.5% against CTX and LMOX. Susceptible strains to TC, DOXY and MINO at MICs less than 2 micrograms/ml were 86.3, 80, and 87.7%, respectively. Those to CP at MICs less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml and to EM at MICs less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml were 86.2 and 71.9%.
