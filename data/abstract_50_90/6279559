We isolated a new transposon Tn2101, from plasmid Rms433 in Enterobacter cloacae. Tn2101 encoded the formation of type IV (carbenicillin-hydrolyzing) beta-lactamase and multiple resistance to streptomycin, sulfanilamide, spectinomycin, and mercury in addition to ampicillin. Tn2101 was transposable between conjugative (or nonconjugative) plasmids and the host chromosome. Transposition occurred independently of the general recombination ability of the host cell. Tn2101 had a molecular size of 9.5 x 10(6) and contained short inverted repeat terminal sequences.
