A case of meningitis and septicaemia due to Haemophilus influenzae type b resistant to both ampicillin and chloramphenicol is reported. After initial failure of chloramphenicol therapy, the patient responded to cefotaxime alone. To our knowledge, this represents the first such reported case in South Africa.
