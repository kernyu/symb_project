The determination of the activity of the product nitrofurantoin (10 and 100 mcg) versus 324 strains of Gram-negative bacteria showed that the diameter of the inhibition zones and the MIC values on a medium with a definite composition (7SG) are considerably larger than on the Mueller-Hinton (MH) medium, in the bacto-tryptose (BT) medium. An increase with 8-12 mm phi or with 2-4 binary dilutions changes the interpretation from resistant, on the MH and BT media into sensitive on the 7SG medium. The low results recorded on the conventional media reveal the existence of an antagonism between peptone and nitrofurantoin, similar to that known for sulfamides. The authors believe that the peptone antagonism has hindered the knowledge of the activity of the nitrofurfural derivatives and the correct assessment of the bacteria sensitivity. They also consider questionable the elimination tendency of the small dosage of microtablets of nitrofurantoin (10 mcg) and sulfamide (30 mcg), since their apparent insufficiency might be due less to the inadequate contraction of substances and more to the inadequate testing media. The results plead for the use of the media with definite chemical composition sulfamide and nitrofuran antagonists free and for reconsideration of several methodologic problems: use of the media with definite chemical composition; introduction of an intermediary dosage of maximum 100 mcg/microtablet; reassessment of the sensitivity categories for sulphafurazole and nitrofurantoin.
