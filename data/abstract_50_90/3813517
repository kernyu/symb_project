Intestinal colonization by members of the family Enterobacteriaceae resistant to cefotaxime was surveyed for 3 years in a hematology-oncology unit. Of 416 patients, 66 (15.9%) were colonized, each with a different strain. The incidence of intestinal carriage was not correlated with cefotaxime consumption in the ward but was strongly associated with individual exposure to cefotaxime.
