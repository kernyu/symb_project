The resistance of Salmonella dublin to eight antibacterial drugs was assessed under diagnostic laboratory conditions. Two techniques were used consecutively and the differences in the results are described. Strains of S. dublin isolated from either calves, adult cattle or abortion material showed no differences in resistance for either of the techniques, though differences between the two techniques were found.
