Halofantrine (WR 171.669) is a phenanthrene methanol derivative effective against the multidrug resistant strains of Plasmodium falciparum. One hundred and one patients, 48 men and 53 women, 53 adults and 48 children (less than or equal to 12 years old) aged from 1.5 to 57 years were treated. Fifty-one patients received a single 16 mg/kg dose and 50 patients received 24 mg/kg/day in 3 doses at 6-hour intervals. Parasite counts with examination of both thin and thick smears were performed twice daily for 5 to 6 days following treatment, or until smears were negative for parasites for 24 hours, and then weekly for 4 weeks. Thirteen patients reported clinical side effects. Six treated patients had no parasites. One patient had mixed parasitemia. Eighty three patients had P. falciparum malaria, with mean parasitemias between 26,850 +/- 36,679 and 35,412 +/- 50,527 per cubic millimeter. Halofantrine was very effective in the two doses tested from 87.5 to 100 p. 100. Eleven patients had in vivo resistant strains; ten in vitro tests were successful and nine were resistant to chloroquine. Thirteen patients with P. vivax and a mean parasitemia of 13,858 +/- 10,835 per cubic millimeter were cured but 3 had a relapse 3 to 4 weeks after treatment. At the 2 dosage levels tested halofantrine proved highly effective in the treatment of malaria caused by resistant and sensitive strains to P. falciparum.
