White rats were kept under hypokinetic conditions for 15, 28 and 60 days. By physiological, microbiological and morphological methods it was demonstrated that hypokinesia had an adverse effect on the clinical development of aseptic inflammation. This effect included a more marked edema and its delayed resorption, an increased temperature of the inflammatory focus, an increased number of infectious complications, involving necrotic foci and ulcerations, enhanced alteration processes, inhibited formation of the demarcation zone, generalized inflammation, etc. Resistance to phlogogenic stimulation fell down to a minimum during the first two hypokinetic weeks; afterwards it gradually returned to normal but did not recover entirely even after 60 days of hypokinesia. Following 15- and 28-day hypokinetic experiments resistance to phlogogenic agents reached the pretest level within 7 days of the recovery period.
