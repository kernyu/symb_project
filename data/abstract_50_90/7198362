Out of three different methods used for bacteriocin sensitivity typing of Klebsiella strains, the "scarpe and streak" method was the most appropriate tool for its routine use in epidemiologic studies. The method is quite simple, reliable and does not imply any special requirements. Out of 533 Klebsiella strains tested by our set of seven bacteriocins 453 (85%) strains proved to be typable and 100 (15%) nontypable. The number of strains typable by bacteriocins was higher than of those typable by phages. In 14 of 19 outbreaks, the predominance of 1-2 distinct patterns of bacteriocin sensitivity was observed. Two large geographical areas have been delineated by two predominant distinct bacteriocin types of Klebsiella strains, each being observed in a high number of outbreaks as well as in sporadic cases belonging to the same area. Although it was not possible to establish any clear correlation between the pattern of bacteriocin sensitivity and the lysotype or serotype of the strains, The present findings offer strong reason to allow recommendation of the bacteriocin sensitivity pattern as a marker of high epidemiologic significance in monitoring Klebsiella cross-infections. Medical and auxiliary workers could play the role of reservoir to Klebsiella strains and for this reason the hospital personnel has to follow carefully strict procedures for ensuring a valid protection of patients especially when coming into direct contact with neonates, infants and debilitated patients.
