A random group of 100 patients in a general hospital were treated with cephazolin sodium for proven urinary tract infections. Sixty-six per cent had conditions predisposing to urinary tract infection. Under these somewhat difficult conditions the original infecting organism remained absent from the urine of 75 per cent of the 70 patients followed in the 3rd to 6th week period. This compares very favourably with response to other antimicrobial agents currently used in urinary tract infections.
