In a study of the diagnosis and treatment of Corynebacterium vaginale (Haemophilus vaginalis) vaginitis in 30 patients, clinical and microscopical findings were compared with laboratory cultures. The study also included a double-blind randomised trial of treatment regimens including placebo therapy. Laboratory cultures of C. vaginale corresponded well with clinical findings, and we suggest that C. vaginale vaginitis can be reliably diagnosed with clinical and microscopical findings. Tetracycline was effective in half the patients treated, whereas all but 1 of the 17 patients eventually treated with metronidazole were cured. The apparent discrepancy between in-vitro sensitivity and in-vitro efficacy of metronidazole in this condition is discussed.
