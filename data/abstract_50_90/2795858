In this study, cefodizime (CDZM, THR-221) was administered to 34 children with infections and the efficacy was evaluated in 30 patients. The efficacy rate was 90.0% and CDZM was proved to be a highly effective antibiotic for infectious diseases in childhood. We also demonstrated that CDZM had strong antibacterial activities against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. No severe toxicity related to intravenous injection of CDZM was observed in our 34 cases.
