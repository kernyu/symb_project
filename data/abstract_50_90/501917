Cefuroxime (CXM) was administered for 1 week to spinal cord injury patients with chronic complicated urinary tract infection and the transitional change of micro-organisms was observed. Bacterial counts and identification of isolated organisms were performed daily on the mid-stream urine for 1 week. MIC was also determined on the strains before and after CXM treatment. The results with 83 strains from 28 patients are as follows: 1. CXM's efficacy appears in line with MIC of strains. With the cases given 0.75 g twice daily intramuscularly, all the 14 strains with MIC lower than 50 micrograms/ml were eradicated, but 2 of the 14 strains were found re-growing, with only bacteriostatic action noted (in region of minimal inhibitory action). With the group of the cases given 1.5 g twice daily, all the 15 strains with MIC lower than 200 micrograms/ml were eradicated from urine 1 approximately 3 days after start of treatment (in region of bactericidal action). 2. At dose of bactericidal action CXM responded effectively with no relationship to organism species or bacterial count before CXM treatment. 3. Dose response was noted between the cases given 1.5 g daily and those given 3.0 g daily. 4. From the above result, we can presume appropriate doses in accordance with the disease conditions. From above observation, combined with correlation between organism species, bacterial count, MIC of strains, etc., CXM's efficacy was assessed quantitatively and objectively.
