Antibiotic-multiresistant S. typhimurium strains, phagovars 20 and 25, of different origin (isolated in hospital infections transferred through everyday contacts and by alimentary route, as well as from samples taken from open water basins and sewage) have been found to carry both transmissible and nontransmissible R plasmids. The frequency of the transfer of R plasmids to Escherichia coli K-12 C 600 rif varies within 0.6 X 10(-5) and 0.7 X 10(-3) per donor cell. The direct transfer of plasmids to S. typhimurium has been mostly realized only in the presence of the mobilizing plasmid, the transfer frequency being 1.0 X 10(-7) to 2.2 X 10(-4) per donor cell. S. typhimurium transconjugates show decreased virulence in both enteral and intraperitoneal infection of mice.
