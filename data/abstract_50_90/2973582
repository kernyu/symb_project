Different antibiotics can be used in combinations to extend the antibacterial spectrum, to obtain a synergistic bactericidal effect or to prevent bacterial resistance. Ceftazidime may be combined with other antibiotic to extend its spectrum to Staphylococci and Enterococci, or even anaerobes. A synergistic effect is mainly obtained with aminoglycosides. To prevent the emergence of resistant strains, ceftazidime may be combined with aminoglycosides and the new quinolones.
