The effects of ethanol on the growth of a wild-type Escherichia coli K-12 are described. These effects include a reduction of the steady-state growth rate and an interference with the division process. They appear as an immediate response to the addition of ethanol and are rapidly reversed by removal of ethanol. Mutants were selected that could grow at a concentration of ethanol that stopped wild-type growth. The growth of one of the mutants we studied (strain S9L100) is stimulated by the presence of ethanol, methanol, or dimethyl sulfoxide. This strain exhibits pleiotropic growth defects including abnormal cell division and morphology. It also appears to have an altered lac permease function which is not due to a mutation in the Y gene itself. We conclude that this mutant has an altered membrane and that the membrane defect may be the cause of the abnormal growth properties. The use of compounds which serve as general membrane perturbants and mutants resistant to these perturbants form a system accessible to both genetic and physical-biochemical techniques.
