In a 10-year cohort of 117 infants hospitalized in Honolulu with Salmonella infections, there were 12 infants with bacteremia or complications (simple bacteremia, 7; bacteremia with probably unrelated concurrent infection, 2; serious complications, 3). The rate of serious complications in this cohort was low and occurred only in infants with previous chronic illness or clinically obvious extraintestinal infection at the time of presentation. Antibiotics were not shown to be of benefit in reducing the frequency of complications; however, the sample size was too small to make definitive conclusions. These data do not support the contention that infants with Salmonella gastroenteritis are at increased risk of complications and should therefore be treated with antibiotics. Rather, the same clinical risk factors for sepsis that apply to all infants also apply to infants with Salmonella gastroenteritis and the decision to begin antibiotic treatment should be based on similar clinical information.
