Despite the one-time hope that malaria would be eradicated, this disease is today still the world's most common severe parasitic disease involving man. The emergence of drug-resistant malaria, especially that due to Plasmodium falciparum, in 1961 therefore caused great concern, particularly among those seeking to control this scourge. Initially P. falciparum species were resistant to a varying degree to chloroquine. Subsequently chloroquine resistance has been followed by resistance to almost all antimalarial agents to which the organism has been exposed by man. Guidance in the diagnosis and treatment of chloroquine-resistant malaria is outlined, as well as the difficulties involved. Further problems which accompany pregnancy complicated by drug-resistant malaria are briefly mentioned. Ways of approaching and possibly retarding the development of drug-resistant malaria are discussed.
