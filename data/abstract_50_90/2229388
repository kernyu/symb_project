The increase in the incidence of infections due to beta-lactam-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci has resulted in expanded use of vancomycin for such infections. Despite this, coagulase-negative staphylococci have remained susceptible to vancomycin in recent years. This report describes a strain of Staphylococcus haemolyticus with increased resistance to vancomycin (MIC, 8.0 to 16 micrograms/ml). S. haemolyticus was initially isolated from a patient with acute leukemia and neutropenia in surveillance throat and stool cultures. The microdilution vancomycin MICs for these isolates were 1.0 to 2.0 micrograms/ml. Subsequent S. haemolyticus isolates from the bloodstream and tracheal aspirate occurred in the setting of prolonged empirical vancomycin therapy. MICs for these isolates were 8.0 to 16 micrograms/ml. Further vancomycin resistance (MIC, 32 micrograms/ml) could be selected for in vitro in all four isolates. Restriction endonuclease analysis of plasmid DNA indicated that the isolates were very closely related and likely to be of the same strain. We conclude that colonization with a vancomycin-susceptible strain of S. haemolyticus was subsequently linked to a nosocomial bloodstream infection with an apparently identical strain with intermediate levels of vancomycin resistance. Prolonged empirical vancomycin therapy was temporally associated with this episode.
