An antibiotic-resistant mutant recommended for the production of colibacterin preparation was isolated from the E. coli strain M-17 highly-sensitive to antibiotics. A possibility of complex use of bacterial preparations (coli- and lactobacterin) with antibiotics and sulphanylamides for prevention of dysbacteriosis was demonstrated.
