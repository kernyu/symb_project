Over a 15-month period, seven intravenous drug abusers had 10 admissions because of bacteremia due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Seven episodes of probable bacterial endocarditis occurred in four patients; one patient had septic thrombophlebitis and two had soft tissue infections. All seven patients patronized a local "shooting gallery" where paraphernalia were provided and drugs were often administered by a "street doctor." All isolates were phage type 29/77/83A/84/85 and demonstrated resistance only to methicillin, oxacillin, and penicillin. This strain of methicillin-resistant S. aureus has a phage type and antibiogram that is distinct from nosocomial methicillin-resistant S. aureus and was probably acquired by intravenous drug abusers during visits to the "shooting gallery". The "shooting gallery" is an integral part of the drug culture and a likely source for the transmission of antibiotic-resistant organisms.
