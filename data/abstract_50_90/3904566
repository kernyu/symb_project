Antimicrobial sensitivities, especially trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, were studied in all clinical isolates of Escherichia coli in an intensive care unit for over 18 months. Twenty-four per cent of strains were resistant to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Combined resistance to ampicillin +/- chloramphenicol (+/- tetracycline) and streptomycin (+/- kanamycin) with resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was demonstrated. These data confirm the previously reported increasing trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole resistance which is probably plasmid-mediated and specify the resistances associated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole resistance. These findings suggest that widespread prophylaxis in granulocytopenic patients with lower urinary tract infection by the trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole association should be re-examined.
