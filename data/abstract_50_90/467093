A combination of 5-fluorocytosine (1000 mg) and candicidin (5 mg) was compared with clotrimazole (100 mg) in the treatment of 112 non-pregnant volunteers with vulvovaginal candidiasis. Seventy-two (75%) of the 96 patients treated with 1 or 2 vaginal tablets of the combination product and 10 (62%) of the 16 women treated with clotrimazole for 6 days were cured. The efficacy of the treatments was assessed mycologically and clinically 1 week and 1 month after the therapy. Both treatments were well tolerated and no side-effects could be detected. It is concluded that a short-term vaginal treatment with a 5-fluorocytosine and candicidin combination is effective in vaginal moniliasis, and the brevity of the treatment is an advantage compared with others now available.
