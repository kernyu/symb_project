Collections of 589 human and 204 animal strains of Salmonella isolated in Ontario during the summer of1974 were examined for susceptibility to 12 antimicrobial agents. Many isolates were found to be resistant to both chloramphenicol (12.4% of the human and 38.2% of the animal sample) and ampicillin. The chloramphenicol resistance almost always occurred in strains which were also resistant to ampicillin and was usually due to a self-transmissible plasmid with a resistance pattern of CmKmSmTc (chloramphenicol, kanamycin, streptomycin, and tetracycline) or CmTc. Ampicillin resistance in these strains was mediated by a variety of plasmids with patterns ApSu (ampicillin and sulfa drugs) and ApSmSu, many of which were nonself-transmissible. Ampicillin resistance in chloramphenicol-sensitive strains was transferable from 21% of the strains, and it was associated with resistance patterns which were different from the self-transferable ampicillin patterns from the chloramphenicol-resistance strains.
