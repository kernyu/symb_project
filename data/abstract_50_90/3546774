A clinical evaluation of astromicin (ASTM) administered by intravenous drip infusion against infections in the surgical field was made, and the results were summarized as follows. Excellent effect was observed in 19 out of a total of 44 cases, good effect in 19, fair in 1 and poor in 5. The efficacy rate calculated from the 38 cases of "excellent" and "good" was 86%. In stratification by disease, the efficacy rate was 91% in localized peritonitis (31/34 cases) and 63% in diffuse peritonitis (5/8 cases); the overall efficacy rate in peritonitis was 86%. The efficacy rate in 2 cases infected by Gram-positive bacteria was 50%, and that in 16 cases by Gram-negative bacteria was 94%. The disappearance rate of Gram-negative bacteria was 93%, and this drug was especially effective against E. coli. There were no subjective or objective side effects and no abnormal laboratory test values that were related to the administration of ASTM.
