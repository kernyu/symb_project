A technique was developed which facilitates the application of elevated temperatures to strains of unknown heat sensitivity during attempts to eliminate antibiotic resistance. Cultures were subjected to a temperature gradient and the lowest temperatures which inhibited growth were found to be highly efficient in the elimination of gentamicin resistance in several strains of Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis.
