A collection of 120 oxacillin-susceptible and 120 oxacillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) from six tertiary care hospital laboratories were tested by agar disk diffusion, three microdilution broth systems (Sensititre, Dynatech, and Alpkem), and the Vitek AutoMicrobic system for comparison with reference agar dilution results. The antimicrobial agents tested were oxacillin, cefazolin, cefotaxime, cefuroxime, cefamandole, fusidic acid, rifampin, and vancomycin. Incubation was at 30 or 35 degrees C for 24, 48, and 72 h. The broth media were supplemented with 2% NaCl for some antimicrobial agents, and the agar dilution method was used with and without the addition of 4% NaCl. The CNS were identified to species by the method of Kloos and Schleifer. The results showed a lack of concordance between two hospitals with respect to oxacillin susceptibility testing by agar dilution with no NaCl supplement. The reasons are not clear but may be related to variations in media. The 4% NaCl supplement or extended incubation to 48 h eliminated this difference. The cefazolin and cefotaxime susceptibility results in the agar disk diffusion test were unreliable if accepted at face value. Cefamandole testing correlated well with the reference method regardless of the method used, and salt supplementation is not recommended. Most of the oxacillin-resistant CNS were resistant to the other beta-lactam drugs except cefamandole. Of 22 CNS resistant to cefamandole, 21 were S. haemolyticus.
