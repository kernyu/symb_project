Sensitivity to selected chemotherapeutics of various bacterial strains was analysed. Bacteria were isolated from the different material collected from patients within 1987-1988, and included: 690 strains of staphylococci, 465 strains of streptococci, 1224 strains of aerobic gram-negative bacilli, and 163 strains of anaerobic micro-organisms. Out of isolated staphylococci, the highest percentage was sensitive to vancomycin, pristinamycin, and fusidic acid. Vancomycin proved the most effective against streptococci followed by chloramphenicol and netilmicin . However, streptococci were highly sensitive to vancomycin within two years whereas their sensitivity to chloramphenicol and netilmicin .
