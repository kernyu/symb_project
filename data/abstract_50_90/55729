A Staphylococcus aureus strain, resistant to aminoglycosides, including gentamicin and tobramycin, and to penicillin, lincomycin, and other antibiotics, caused an outbreak of hospital infection in a surgical ward which spread to the intensive-therapy unit and to two other hospitals. 21 patients were colonised and 9 of these had overt clinical infection. Administration of antibiotics to which the staphylococcus was resistant was associated with colonisation. The use of gentamicin, tobramycin, and lincomycin in these hospitals has increased as has the occurrence of bacterial resistance to these agents. An antibiotic policy to control their use is essential to preserve their value in life-threatening infections by bacteria resistant to other agents.
