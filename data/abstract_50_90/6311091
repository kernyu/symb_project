A plaque-reduction assay was used to examine the susceptibility of five phosphonoformic acid-resistant variants of herpes simplex virus type 1 to arabinosylnucleosides and aphidicolin. These viruses were cross-resistant to arabinosylhypoxanthine and to arabinosyladenine when tested in the absence of deoxycoformycin, a deaminase inhibitor. In the presence of deoxycoformycin, no cross-resistance between arabinosyladenine and phosphonoformic acid was observed. The two variants tested were cross-resistant to arabinosylthymine, and all five variants were collaterally susceptible to aphidicolin inhibition.
