Twenty-four patients with a history of recurrent urinary tract infection and in whom residual urine was considered to be a factor of importance for chronicity, have been treated for an average of 16 months with 1 g methenamine hippurate morning and evening. No patient had urinary calculus at the commencement of treatment and neither did any patient have an indwelling catheter. In patients without urinary tract infection or in whom abacteriuria was achieved with methenamine hippurate, the number of reinfections was reduced by approximately two thirds compared to periods prior to treatment. No patient was completely free from infection throughout the whole treatment period. However, in no case did bacteria with extensive resistance appear. When urinary tract infection was treated with methenamine hippurate, abacteriuria was achieved in only 6 of 14 patients. It would therefore seem that this agent is only of limited value for treatment of established infection. In the event of manifest infection it would appear appropriate to treat the infection primarily with antibiotics and to use methenamine hippurate for prophylaxis when abacteriuria has been achieved. No patient developed urinary calculus during treatment with methenamine hippurate and no deterioration of renal function or haematological change was observed.
