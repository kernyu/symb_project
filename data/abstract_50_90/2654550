Escherichia coli K12ND-160 possesses characteristics which make it highly suitable for studies on mutagenic/antimutagenic specificity and has been used to investigate such effects for several agents. Nitrofurazone (NFZ) was used as a mutagen at non-lethal concentrations; it causes mutation from fucose sensitivity to resistance (FucS----FucR) and from inability to utilize melibiose to melibiose utilization (Mel(-)----Mel+), but does not induce mutations from deoxygalactose sensitivity to resistance (DGAS----DGAR). Caffeine is mutagenic for reversions from lactose non-utilization to utilization (Lac(-)----Lac+) and mutations from FucS----FucR, but it is antimutagenic for mutations from 6-azauracil sensitivity to resistance (AzaUS----AzaUR) and Mel(-)----Mel+ reversions and produces no effect on spontaneous DGAS----DGAR mutations. Added guanosine and cytidine (G + C at 100 micrograms/ml each) exert antimutagenic activity against spontaneous Lac(-)----Lac+ reversion, but not against caffeine-induced Lac(-)----Lac+ reversions; a strong antimutagenic effect on spontaneous Mel(-)----Mel+ reversion is also observed. The addition of G + C does not result in either mutagenic or antimutagenic effects against spontaneous or NFZ-induced FucS----FucR or DGAS----DGAR mutations; it is, however, strongly mutagenic for AzaUS----AzaUR mutations. The 'natural antimutagen', chlorophyllin, is antimutagenic for DGAS----DGAR mutations, but fails to demonstrate such activity against spontaneous or caffeine-induced Lac(-)----Lac+ reversion, spontaneous or NFZ-induced Mel(-)----Mel+ reversion, or spontaneous or NFZ-induced FucS----FucR mutation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
