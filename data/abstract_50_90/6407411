Individuals who have suffered severe trauma, such as burns, have a high incidence of infection associated with impaired host resistance. Nonspecific stimulators of host defense mechanisms, i.e., immunomodulators, may be of benefit in such situations. A small animal model (guinea pigs) was developed to study the efficacy of immunomodulators in burns. Anesthetized animals received a 20% total body surface area, full-thickness, scald burn. There was no mortality associated with this injury, but these animals were highly susceptible to challenge with Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain 1244 by direct injection into the burn wound within 24 hours of injury. This susceptibility persisted about 7 days. The standard model adopted was to injure animals, then challenge with 1 median lethal dose (LD50) of P. aeruginosa 96 hours after injury. Using this model, six synthetic immunomodulators were tested: CP-20,961, CP-46,665, muramyl dipeptide, thymopoietin pentapeptide (TP-5), levamisole, and lithium. Drug administration began 24 hours after injury and ended prior to challenge with P. aeruginosa at 96 hours. CP-20,961, muramyl dipeptide, levamisole, and lithium all had no beneficial effect on survival. A single dosage (0.3 mg/kg, I.V.) of CP-46,665, administered 24 hours postinjury, increased the survival rate from 50% to 85% and mean survival time (MST) from 8.2 days to 12.4 days. TP-5, given in four doses (0.1 mg/kg, I.V. each) every 24 hours, increased the survival rate from 40% to 80% and MST from 6.9 days to 11.6 days. These data show that immunomodulators could be of benefit in burns, but also that not all agents are effective in this particular situation.
