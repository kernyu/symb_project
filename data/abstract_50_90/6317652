The structural gene region for tetracycline resistance on Tn10 consists of two complementation groups, tetA and tetB (M. S. Curiale and S. B. Levy, J. Bacteriol. 151:209-215, 1982). Using a series of deletion mutants, we have determined that the tetA region is 450 to 600 base pairs long and that the tetB region, which is adjacent to tetA, is 600 to 750 base pairs long. Point mutations in either tetA or tetB affected the amount and size of the inducible inner-membrane Tet protein synthesized in Escherichia coli maxicells. Moreover, deletions in these regions led to the synthesis of an appropriately smaller Tet protein. A single tetracycline-inducible RNA of about 1,200 bases was detected that was homologous with the tetracycline resistance structural gene region. These results indicate that the tetA and tetB complementation regions represent two parts of a single gene encoding two domains of the tetracycline resistance protein Tet.
