A 205bp DNA fragment from the Streptomyces multi-copy plasmid pIJ101 has in vivo terminator activity both in Streptomyces lividans and in Escherichia coli. Termination of RNA synthesis, detected by high-resolution S1 nuclease mapping, occurs at precisely the same nucleotides in both organisms. This suggests that the E. coli RNA polymerase recognizes the same sequence elements and chooses the point(s) of termination in the same way as the corresponding S. lividans enzyme.
