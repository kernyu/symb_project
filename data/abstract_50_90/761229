Assays of thirteen cell lines, derived from mouse lymphomas, myelomas, myeloid tumors, and a mastocytoma, for sensitivity to growth inhibition by 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine (ara-C) revealed a spectrum between the most and least sensitive which differed 100-fold from each other. An inverse correlation between sensitivity and cellular deoxycytidine 5'-triphosphate (dCTP) content was found, and this suggested that sensitivity of cells might be increased if the dCTP content was lowered during cell exposure to ara-C. Previous work has shown that thymidine treatment of cells lowers their dCTP content, and the effect of thymidine on the sensitivity of six of the cell lines to ara-C was therefore measured. Concentrations of thymidine below those inhibitory to cell growth by themselves caused an increase in ara-C sensitivity by up to 3-fold in 4 cell lines in which thymidine causes a depression in dCTP content but not in 2 myeloid lines in which the dCTP content was found not to be depressed by the same thymidine treatment. The results confirm an important role for dCTP in determining cellular sensitivity to ara-C. The finding that the sensitivity of 2 lymphoma cell lines to ara-C could be increased by concentrations of thymidine in the region of 10 micrometer, which are attainable clinically in humans, suggests that a combination of ara-C with thymidine might be useful in the treatment of some human tumors.
