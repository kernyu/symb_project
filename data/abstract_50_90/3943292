The susceptibilities of 317 gram-negative bacilli to cefpiramide, cefotaxime, and piperacillin were determined by standardized microdilution and disk diffusion tests. Cefpiramide and piperacillin were more consistently active against nonfermenters than against Enterobacteriaceae, whereas cefotaxime was more active against Enterobacteriaceae. Inhibitory zone diameters of approximately 75-micrograms cefpiramide disks correlated well with minimal inhibitory concentrations (r = 0.85); breakpoints for defining susceptibility and resistance were recommended.
