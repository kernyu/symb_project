Twenty strains of avian mycoplasma, representing 12 serotypes, were tested in vitro for their susceptibility to the action of lincomycin and spectinomycin alone and in combination. They varied in their sensitivity pattern. The ranges of minimal inhibitory concentration were 1 to 20 mug/ml for lincomycin or spectinomycin alone and 0.5/1 to 3/6 mug/ml for the lincomycin and spectinomycin combination. The ranges of minimal lethal concentration were greater with either single antibiotic than with the antibiotic combination. The amount of each antibiotic required to achieve mycoplasmacidal action of the relatively resistant strains was less with the antibiotic combination than with the single antibiotics.
