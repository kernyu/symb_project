Strains of enterobacteria (nine Escherichia coli and two Salmonella) isolated from primary or secondary infections in the dog, cat, pig, calf and kangaroo were studied for the presence of extrachromosomal drug resistance factors (R factors). Seven strains of E. coli and two strains of Salmonella transferred resistance involving the following antibiotics: streptomycin, ampicillin, chloramphenicol, neomycin and tetracycline. All strains harboring R factors transferred streptomycin resistance and the identified resistance patterns were as follows: Sm Am, Sm Te, Sm Neo, Sm Am Te, Sm CI Neo and Sm Am CI Te. The levels of resistance observed were comparable for all donor strains and their converted recipients. Strains of E. coli harboring R factors were isolated from three dogs that had died of either otitis (followed by a generalized infection), enteritis or bronchopneumonia - secondary to distemper. The bacteria isolated from cats were recovered at the necropsy of animals that had died of purulent pleuresy and feline panleukopenia. The other strains (two Salmonella and one E. coli were isolated from fatal enteric diseases in the pig, calf and kangaroo.
