The in vitro activities of daptomycin, teicoplanin, and three other antimicrobial agents were determined against 105 strains of Staphylococcus haemolyticus and 92 strains of Staphylococcus epidermidis. The MICs for 90% of strains tested (MIC90s) of fusidic acid and rifampin were less than or equal to 0.25 microgram/ml. The MIC90s of daptomycin and vancomycin were less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml. Teicoplanin had a comparable MIC90 of less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml for isolates of S. epidermidis. However, MIC90s were 8 and 16 micrograms/ml for oxacillin-susceptible and oxacillin-resistant S. haemolyticus, respectively. Disk diffusion tests were evaluated for daptomycin and teicoplanin. Disks with 30 micrograms of teicoplanin performed satisfactorily when S. epidermidis was tested, but when S. haemolyticus was tested, there was a very major error rate of 10% and a minor error rate of 38%.
