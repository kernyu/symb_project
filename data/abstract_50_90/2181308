The point mutation at nucleotide 323 within the dihydrofolate reductase-thymidylate synthase gene of Plasmodium falciparum, which distinguishes pyrimethamine-sensitive from drug-resistant isolates, can be discriminated by the polymerase chain reaction using mutation-specific primers. The technique makes use of the principle that short oligonucleotides with a perfect match at their 3' ends, complementary to the mutation to be detected, will initiate the polymerization by Taq polymerase far more efficiently than primers with a single mismatch in this position. The Asn-108 codon was detected using a primer of 17 nucleotides with an adenosine at its 3' end, the Thr-108 codon with a 14-mer primer ending with a cytosine and the Ser-108 codon with a 16-mer containing guanidine at the critical 3' end. By selecting appropriate counterprimers, the size of the amplification products is either indicative of pyrimethamine-resistant parasites of the 7G8 type, or of pyrimethamine-sensitive parasites of the FCR-3 type or 3D7 type. The fragments obtained can be easily separated in a single lane after agarose gel electrophoresis. Coded P. falciparum DNA samples were typed unambiguously using these primers as were reconstituted parasitized blood samples stored as high salt lysates. Sensitivity, speed and specificity make this assay a realistic alternative to in vitro drug testing to monitor the resistance of P. falciparum to inhibitors of the dihydrofolate reductase.
