The emergence in 1988 of ciprofloxacin-resistant methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in New York City was studied in nine hospitals and eight nursing homes. Of the 43 hospitalized patients studied, 21 were admitted from home, while nine of the 12 nursing home patients were transferred from a hospital. Twenty-four of the 55 patients had been treated previously with ciprofloxacin, and 26 had an identifiable risk factor for a nosocomial infection. MRSA was a contributing factor in at least five of the 21 deaths. MRSA resistance to ciprofloxacin was detected within three months of the drug's commercial availability, apparently emerged independently at a number of the health care facilities, and has become widespread. If such resistance is found in a health care facility, ciprofloxacin may not be useful as a first line antibiotic.
