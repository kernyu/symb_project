Under general anaesthesia cultures were taken from infantile tonsils prior to T & A. The bacteriological results and the serological classification of hemophilus are questionning literature reports. According to our findings one must consider haemophilus influencae as a resident of the common oral flora. There was no significant difference culturing tonsils with or without repeated antibiotic treatment. Hemophilus influencae combined with beta-hemolytic streptococci is common. Immunological considerations against infantile T & A, based on bacteriological observations are questioned.
