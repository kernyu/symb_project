We studied two outbreaks of calf salmonellosis caused by apramycin and gentamicin-resistant Salmonella typhimurium strains. In both cases, the responsible strains were resistant to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, kanamycin, streptomycin, tetracycline, and trimethoprim; one strain was also resistant to nalidixic acid in one outbreak. A systematic survey of the intestinal Escherichia coli strains of calves from the two affected flocks showed that 11 of 24 animals sampled were also colonized by apramycin- and gentamicin-resistant E. coli strains. These isolates belonged to four biotypes and were resistant to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, kanamycin, streptomycin, tetracycline, trimethoprim, and nalidixic acid. All of the strains were resistant to high levels of apramycin (MICs, 512 to 1,024 micrograms/ml) and to gentamicin (MICs, 8 to 32 micrograms/ml), and these resistances were always transferred en bloc. In S. typhimurium, this coresistance was borne by plasmids that were approximately 39 kilobases long (outbreak 1) or 90 kilobases long (outbreak 2), whereas in E. coli, the coresistance was due to plasmids that were approximately 110 kilobases long in both outbreaks. The two plasmids of Salmonella and four plasmids of E. coli encoded type IV aminoglycoside 3-N-acetyltransferases. The intensive use of curative and preventive treatments in calf production could be responsible for the emergence of enzymic resistance to apramycin and gentamicin.
