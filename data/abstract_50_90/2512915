The relative stability of spores of Bacillus cereus grown at three different temperatures was examined by using quasi-elastic light scattering (q.l.s.) in conjunction with turbidity and scanning electron microscopy (s.e.m.). Cultures grown at 20, 30 and 40 degrees C (BC20, BC30 and BC40 respectively) were compared in terms of (i) their effective hydrodynamic radius, rH, as determined from q.l.s. and (ii) their gross morphology, as determined from s.e.m. The effects of autoclaving at 121.1 degrees C on both these properties was also examined. We observed (1) that cultures BC20 and BC30 appeared to have similar values for rH, whereas that of BC40 appeared some 50% higher, and (2) BC40 had a correspondingly much lower heat resistance (its structural integrity was lost after about 20 min autoclaving, whereas that of BC20 and BC30 was retained even after 80 min autoclaving). These data were in good agreement with independent measurements of heat-resistance coefficients. Changes in the hydrodynamic radius, polydispersity (both using q.l.s.) and turbidity were monitored with time on addition of the disinfectants sodium hypochlorite and peracetic acid; again BC40 appeared to have a lower resistance.
