A slowly growing, polymyxin-sensitive mutant of Salmonella typhimurium was isolated. Wild-type phage P22 form plaques on the mutant at 5 x 10(-4), the frequency observed on wild-type hosts. All P22 clear mutants form plaques with near normal frequency. The inability of the mutant to form plaques is correlated with an increase in lysogenization frequency. The cause of the increased lysogenization frequency is not known, but it is not the result of overproduction of cyclic adenosine 5'-monophosphate.
