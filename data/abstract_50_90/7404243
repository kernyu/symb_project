The sudden acquisition of aminoglycoside resistance among Salmonella group C1 isolates causing summer diarrhoea raised the possibility oif plasmid-mediated reistance. The demonstration of circular DNA species in the resistant, but not in the sensitive salmonellae and the transfer by conjugation of antibiotic resistance to a sensitive strain of Escherichic coli, was consistent with plasmid-mediated resistance.
