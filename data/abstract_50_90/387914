Gel electrophoresis of DNA from 95 clinical isolates of Shigella sonnei and Shigella flexneri resistant to antibiotics revealed a heterogeneous plasmid population. Most of the plasmids were smaller than 6 megadaltons (Mdal). Six S. sonnei isolates with the most common antibiotic resistance pattern were characterized. They had two plasmids in common: one was a self-transmissible Fi+ plasmid of 46 Mdal encoding resistance to streptomycin and sulphafurazole. In addition, several cryptic plasmids ranging in size from 1.0 to 24.5 Mdal were present. Mobilization of the 5.5 Mdal SuSm plasmid and a 1.0 Mdal cryptic plasmid was demonstrated with all six S. sonnei isolates during conjugation. This mobilization was mediated by the 46 Mdal self-transmissible Fi+ R plasmid and also by a 24.5 Mdal Fi- plasmid carrying no known drug resistance determinants.
