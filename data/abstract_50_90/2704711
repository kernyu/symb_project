Direct endolymphatic administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics was used in treatment of approximately 21 patients with complicated urogenital tuberculosis. The duration of the endolymphatic therapy ranged from 3 to 13 days. In the patients treated with endolymphatic administration of the antibiotics the effects were favourable. The use of the procedure were shown expedient because marked lesions in the urinary tracts, frequent chronic renal failure and the microbial flora resistance to the drugs lowered the efficacy of the treatment with the routine administration of the drugs. The drugs used i.e. klaforan and gentamicin were approved by the USSR Pharmacological Committee. The drugs were administered with dosator NDL-3 in original modification which provided continuous polycollector endolymphatic antibiotic therapy with simultaneous lavage of the lymphatic channel. It was shown expedient to use endolymphatic administration of antibiotics in treatment of complicated urogenital tuberculosis alone or in combination with the preoperative procedures.
