Beta-lactam resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa detected only during ceftazidime therapy of cystic fibrosis patients was studied. Evaluation of resistant and susceptible isolates from one patient and resistant laboratory derivatives indicated that elevated beta-lactamase levels were the primary determinant of resistance. Susceptible isolates outgrew resistant isolates on antibiotic-free medium.
