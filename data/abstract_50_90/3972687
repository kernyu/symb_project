Fifty horses from a herd known to have benzimidazole-resistant small strongyles were treated with febantel (6 mg/kg), combinations of febantel (6 mg/kg) and piperazine citrate (25 or 55 mg base/kg), thiabendazole (44 mg/kg), or placebo (0.6 ml of water/kg). Pretreatment and 7-day posttreatment fecal examinations were done. Fecal cultures, strongyle egg per gram (epg) counts, sugar flotation fecal examinations, and in vitro testing for benzimidazole resistance were performed. Results of fecal examinations before treatment were similar in all horses, and results of testing were positive for benzimidazole resistance. Horses treated with febantel and piperazine at all dosages had significantly lower mean strongyle epg counts and greater percentage reduction in mean strongyle epg counts (99.7% to 99.9%) 7 days after treatment, compared with those determined for horses treated with febantel, thiabendazole, or placebo. Adverse reactions to treatment were not observed.
