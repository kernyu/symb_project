The in vitro activities of six commonly used antibiotics and six newer beta-lactam agents were determined in 50 consecutive clinical isolates of beta-lactamase-negative Neisseria gonorrhoeae. The gonococci isolated were notably resistant to penicillin, ampicillin, erythromycin, and tetracycline, whereas all of the strains were susceptible to the newer beta-lactam agents cefoxitin and spectinomycin.
