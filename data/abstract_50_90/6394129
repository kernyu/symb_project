The safety and clinical efficacy of cefoperazone were evaluated at 149 institutions in Japan. A total of 979 hospitalized patients were treated with cefoperazone alone for 1,059 infections. In the 984 infections evaluated, there was an overall satisfactory clinical response in 824 (83.7%). Cefoperazone was effective in 83.0% of the respiratory tract infections, 84.9% of urinary tract infections, and 89.6% of hepatobiliary tract infections. Clinical response was satisfactory in 90% or more of the cases in which Escherichia coli, Serratia sp, Haemophilus influenzae or Staphylococcus sp were isolated. Sixty percent to 90% of the infections with Klebsiella sp, Enterobacter sp, Proteus sp, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa responded satisfactorily to cefoperazone. Cefoperazone was effective in 76.2% of 260 evaluated cases that had failed to respond to prior treatment with other cephalosporins. The adverse reactions that occurred in 19 (1.9%) of the 979 patients included rash (1%), diarrhea (0.6%), and fever (0.4%). Cefoperazone appears to be extremely useful in the treatment of various infections in hospitalized patients.
