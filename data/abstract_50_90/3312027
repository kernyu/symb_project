In a multicentre study conducted by the Paul-Ehrlich-Gesellschaft we tested about 3,584 clinical isolates from 25 laboratories towards different chemotherapeutics. Using a microdilution test Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis strains regarded as causative pathogens were studied. The data were evaluated for the number, frequency and qualitative characteristics of multiple resistance patterns. None of the strains under test was resistant to all antibiotics tested. Amikacin showed the lowest prevalence of resistance. The significance of such data in the epidemiological control of resistance to chemotherapeutics is discussed.
