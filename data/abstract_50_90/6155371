The antibiotics thiostrepton, siomycin, and sporangiomycin are closely related both in structure and in mode of action. Actinomycetes which produce this group of compounds possess ribonucleic acid-pentose methylases, which act upon 23S ribosomal ribonucleic acid and render ribosomes resistant to the action of these antibiotics. This is achieved via the formation of a single residue of 2'-O-methyladenosine per ribosome.
