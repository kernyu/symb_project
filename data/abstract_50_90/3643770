The effect of ampiox combination with a quinoline derivative (QD) on penicillin resistant strains of Staphylococcus was studied. Combination of ampiox and QD had in vitro a synergistic action. It was shown that the combined use of ampiox in a dose of 5 mg/kg and QD in a dose of 10 mg/kg had a pronounced therapeutic effect in staphylococcal septicemia of albino mice: 95 per cent prevention of death in the experimental animals and lower contamination of the animal internal organs. It was noted that ampiox and QD had different mechanisms of action on the bacterial cell. Therefore, their combination may be used for increasing antistaphylococcal activity of the antibiotic drug.
