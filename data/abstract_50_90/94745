The resistance to several drugs was determined in 29 pathogenic strains of Escherichia coli (026, 055 and 0111) isolated from infant diarrhoea and 18 non-pathogenic E. coli strains isolated from the same individuals. Both pathogenic and nonpathogenic strains were resistant to at least 1 to 10 drugs, but only in four cases resistance patterns of the pathogenic strains were identical with those of non pathogenic ones. The majority of the strains were resistant to sulfonamide, tetracycline, ampicillin, carbenicillin, neomycin and kanamycin. The drug resistance (except the resistance to nalidixic acid and rifampicin) was associated with conjugative R-plasmids. Some of the tested strains carried two R-plasmids in one cell, being in hetero R-state.
