The pharmacokinetics and bacteriological efficacies of penicillin G, ceftriaxone, vancomycin, and imipenem were determined in rabbits with experimental meningitis caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae strains with different penicillin susceptibilities. Drug dosages were adjusted to attain peak concentrations in serum that were similar to those observed in infants and children. In animals infected with a penicillin-susceptible (MBC, 0.008 micrograms/ml) pneumococcus, penicillin G and ceftriaxone reduced the number of organisms in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) by greater than or equal to 4.14 log10 CFU/ml after single doses and after 9-h continuous infusions. A single large dose (50 mg/kg) of penicillin G was comparatively ineffective (-2.15 log10 CFU/ml) against a relatively penicillin-resistant (MBC, 0.5 micrograms/ml) strain, whereas ceftriaxone therapy resulted in a 3.66- and 4.77-log10 CFU/ml reduction after single doses and 9-h continuous infusions, respectively. In animals in which meningitis was caused by a penicillin-resistant (MBC, 8.0 micrograms/ml) pneumococcus, a single dose of penicillin (50 or 150 mg/kg) or of ceftriaxone failed to lower the number of organisms in CSF. Vancomycin and imipenem reduced the counts in CSF by at least 2.19 and 4.10 log10 CFU/ml after single doses and 9-h infusions, respectively. In all experiments, a bactericidal titer of greater than or equal to 1:8 in CSF was necessary to achieve a maximal bacteriological effect.
