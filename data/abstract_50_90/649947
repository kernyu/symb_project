Corynebacterium kutscheri and its alleged avirulent variant were re-examined in C57Bl/6 and Swiss Lynch mice. It was confirmed that while C57Bl/6 mice were resistant and Swiss Lynch susceptible to C. kutscheri, the alleged atypical variant was avirulent in both mouse strains. However, following immunosuppression of C57Bl/6 mice with hydrocortisone acetate, it was not possible to reactivate latent C. kutscheri or the alleged atypical variant; this was contrary to previous reports. Moreover, sequential hysterectomy derivation over four generations of C57Bl/6 mice did not eliminate their resistance to C. kutscheri compared with conventionally born animals. Vaccination with live attenuated C. kutscheri protected susceptible mice against virulent challenge; vaccination with the alleged atypical variant afforded no such protection. The suggested role of the alleged avirulent variant in resistance to C. kutscheri is challenged and an alternative explanation of such resistance is proposed.
