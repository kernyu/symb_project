The sensitivity of rat cerebellar Purkinje cells to ethanol exposure during fetal, neonatal or adult life was assessed by histological techniques. Pregnant female rats were exposed to ethanol vapour during the last 2 weeks of gestation. Purkinje cells were counted 5 days after the pups were born. The number of Purkinje cells in lobe VIII was reduced by 45%, and the linear density of Purkinje cells in lobe I was 47% less than in controls not exposed to ethanol. Smaller reductions were found in other lobes. The weight of the cerebellum was reduced by 34%. Neonatal rats were exposed to ethanol vapour briefly during daylight hours on the third and fourth days after birth. Purkinje cells were counted on the fifth day after birth, and losses similar to those described above were found, with additional significant reductions of cell numbers in lobe I and of Purkinje cell density in lobe VIII. The weight of the cerebellum was reduced by only 4%. Adult male rats were exposed to ethanol vapour for 3 weeks and no Purkinje cell losses were subsequently found. The dura overlying the cerebellum of separate adult male rats was superfused with 100% ethanol for 1 h and no abnormalities were detected with electron microscopy in the exposed cortex 6 days later. It is remarkable that the brief neonatal treatment caused a more widespread loss of Purkinje cells than the 10 days of exposure to ethanol in utero, whereas the Purkinje cells present in adult animals show a great resistance to ethanol. The neonatal period seems to be a time of high susceptibility of Purkinje cells to ethanol.
