RU. 41 740, a glycoprotein extract from Klebsiella pneumoniae O1K2 strain was tested for its ability to enhance resistance of mice against influenza virus infection. Local (aerosol) and systemic (IP) routes of RU. 41 740 administration were compared for their effectiveness in protecting mice. When RU. 41 740 was administered prophylactically (10 mg/kg) via aerosol route (5 consecutive days before challenge), significant protection (P less than 0.0001) was conferred against lethal aerosol inoculation of influenza virus. Treated mice exhibited a reduced mortality, a decreased lung-to-body weight ratio and lower intrapulmonary virus titers. The main glycoprotein soluble fraction (RU. 41 821) was as active as the total glycoprotein extract (P less than 0.0001). Whereas the local (aerosol) route of administration was effective, the systemic (intraperitoneal) route of administration did not confer significant protection against an aerosol inoculum of virus. This finding suggests the important role of local immunity. The levels of interferon in the lavage fluids of immunized and infected mice suggest that interferon is not the main protective mechanism. The enhanced protection observed could be related to an augmented humoral or cell-mediated response within the lung.
