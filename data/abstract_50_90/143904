Resistance of 2345 strains of plasmocoagulating staphylococci isolated from purulent inflammatory foci of surgical patients was studied with respect to the widely used antibiotics by the method of standard paper discs in 1970--1975. It was noted that the cultures resistant to erythromycin and monomycin were more frequent, i.e. from 24.2 +/- 2.5 to 51.4 +/- 3.4 per cent and from 1.0 +/- 0.6 to 28.0 +/- 2.1 per cent respectively, p less than 0.001 in both cases, while the percentage of the strains resistant to benzylpenicillin and tetracycline steadily increased, i.e. from 69.9 +/- 2.4 to 47.0 +/- 2.3 per cent and from 72.8 +/- 2.4 to 28.4 +/- 2.1 per cent respectively, p less than 0.001 in both cases. The number of the resistant cultures to streptomycin and levomycetin slightly changed and was relatively high (about 50 per cent and more). Direct correlation (mean and pronounced) between the amount of levomycetin, tetracycline, erythromycin or monomycin used per citizen of Minsk and the frequency of the strains isolated from the patients to these drugs was noted.
