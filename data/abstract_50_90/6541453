Aztreonam at doses of 1 or 2 g given intramuscularly or intravenously every 8 h for 7 to 42 days was given to 55 patients, most of them suffering from difficult-to-treat infections either because the isolated pathogens were multiresistant or because of the location of the infection. Infections included: urinary tract (23 cases), deep soft tissue phlegmon (12 cases), chronic osteomyelitis in exacerbation (7 cases), abscesses (7 cases), pneumonia (4 cases), and external otitis (2 cases). In culture specimens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (24 isolates) and various Enterobacteriaceae species (37 isolates) were isolated with MICs ranging from 0.25 to 16 micrograms/ml. Clinically, at the completion of treatment and after a 6-week posttreatment follow-up, 45 (81.6%) patients were cured, 4 (7.2%) improved, 3 (5.6%) relapsed, and 3 (5.6%) failed to respond to therapy. Bacteriologically, at the end of treatment, the pathogen was eradicated in 50 patients (91%) and persisted in 5 (9%). After a 6-week follow-up, cultures remained sterile in 33 patients (60.0%), 16 (29.1%) relapsed, in 6 (10.9%) bacteria persisted, and superinfection was reported in 4 (7.3%) patients. No appreciable adverse effects or toxicity was observed. From the reported results, it is concluded that aztreonam is a valuable addition to the field of antimicrobial chemotherapy that can be used effectively and safely in the treatment of a variety of gram-negative infections.
