Worldwide experience with imipenem/cilastatin in the treatment of 72 patients with a variety of obstetric and gynecologic infections is reviewed. Clinical cure or improvement occurred in 97% of 72 assessable patients. The most common etiologic pathogens were Escherichia coli, group B streptococci, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococci, Bacteroides bivius, Bacteroides species, Bacteroides fragilis, and Peptostreptococcus. Of the recovered pathogens, 99.5% were susceptible to imipenem/cilastatin. Bacteriologic response was also excellent and none of the pathogens acquired resistance to imipenem. Most patients tolerated intravenous administration of imipenem/cilastatin well to moderately well.
