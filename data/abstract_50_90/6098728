In vitro activity of ceftriaxone (CTRX) was examined by agar plates dilution method against 398 strains isolated from the infections in the field of obstetrics and gynecology. MIC90 of CTRX against Staphylococcus (107 strains), E. coli (54 strains), K. pneumoniae (27 strains), Peptococcus and Peptostreptococcus (106 strains) and Bacteroides (104 strains) was more than 100 micrograms/ml, less than 0.20 micrograms/ml, less than 0.20 micrograms/ml, 6.25 micrograms/ml and 50 micrograms/ml, respectively. The concentrations of CTRX 16.9 hours after 1 hour intravenous drip infusion with 1 g were 46.2 micrograms/ml in the uterine artery, 48.0 micrograms/ml in the cubital vein, 11.0 micrograms/g in the endometrium, myometrium and cervix uteri, and 14.0 micrograms/g in the portio vaginalis. These concentrations of CTRX in the serum and uterine tissues were higher than the level required to inhibit 90% of the strains of E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and Peptococcus and Peptostreptococcus, isolated from the infections in the field of obstetrics and gynecology. Clinical efficacy of CTRX was evaluated in 7 cases consisting of 2 with puerperal fever and one each with puerperal intrauterine infection, intrauterine infection, pyometra, adnexitis and Bartholin's abscess. Clinical and bacteriological efficacies were seen in 6 and 4 cases, respectively. Neither noteworthy adverse reactions nor laboratory abnormalities were observed throughout this study.
