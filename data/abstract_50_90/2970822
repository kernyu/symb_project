The relationship of age and housing location to single antibiotic resistance, multiple antibiotic resistance, and resistance patterns of fecal coliforms obtained during a 20-month period from pigs in a herd that was not exposed to antibiotics for 126 months was determined. Bacteria resistant to single and multiple antibiotics were isolated more frequently (P less than 0.01) from pigs under 7 months of age. A greater proportion of isolates from pigs over 6 months of age was sensitive to the 13 antimicrobial agents tested (P less than 0.01), while a smaller proportion showed resistance to single (P less than 0.05) and multiple (P less than 0.01) antibiotics. More than 80% of the resistant isolates were resistant to tetracycline, streptomycin, or sulfisoxazole. Resistance was greater (P less than 0.01) for pigs in the finishing unit than for those on pasture. Resistance to ampicillin, carbenicillin, and tetracycline was greater (P less than 0.05) for pigs in the finishing unit than for those in the farrowing house. More isolates from pigs on pasture were sensitive to all antimicrobial agents tested (P less than 0.01). A greater proportion of isolates from pigs in the finishing unit showed resistance to a single antibiotic (P less than 0.01). The data from this study suggest that exposure to antibiotics is not the only factor that influences the prevalence of bacteria that are resistant to single and multiple antibiotics in the feces of domestic animals and that considerable research is needed to define the factors influencing antibiotic resistance in fecal bacteria.
