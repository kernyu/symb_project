We have cloned the EcoRI fragments of pLC1, a circular DNA element found in an Escherichia coli dnaAts strain integratively suppressed by R100.1 (Chandler et al., 1977a), using the plasmid vector pCR1. All the resistance genes known to be present on the r-determinant of R100.1 were found to be present on pLC1. The isolation of pCR1 derivatives carrying various EcoRI fragments of either pLC1 or R100.1 has allowed a more precise mapping of the position of the resistance genes on the R100.1 molecule.
