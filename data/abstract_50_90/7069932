Daily 150 mg or 200 mg dose of netilmicin (NTL) were administered to 26 patients with chronic complicated urinary tract infections for 5 days, and the following results were obtained. 1) Out of 26 cases excellent response was seen in 5 cases, good response in 4, and poor response in 11. Effectiveness rate was 45%. Six cases were excluded from the evaluation. 2) Effective result was not seen in the catheterized group, whereas 5 excellent and 4 good cases were observed in the noncatheterized group, resulting 60% in effectiveness rate. 3) MICs of NTL against various bacteria were comparative to GM against P. aeruginosa, to AMK against Serratia, and to both GM and AMK against other bacteria. 4) Except a slight local irritation, no subjective side effect was observed. One case showed a slight elevation in hepatic function tests but it was not definitely judged as the side effect due to NTL.
