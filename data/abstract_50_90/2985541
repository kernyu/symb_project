The complete nucleotide sequence of ermA, the prototype macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B resistance gene from Staphylococcus aureus, has been determined. The sequence predicts a 243-amino-acid protein that is homologous to those specified by ermC, ermAM, and ermD, resistance determinants from Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus sanguis, and Bacillus licheniformis, respectively. The ermA transcript, identified by Northern analysis and S1 mapping, contains a 5' leader sequence of 211 bases which has the potential to encode two short peptides of 15 and 19 amino acids; the second, longer peptide has 13 amino acids in common with the putative regulatory leader peptide of ermC. The coding sequence for this peptide is deleted in several mutants in which macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B resistance is constitutively expressed. Potential secondary structures available to the leader sequence of the wild-type (inducible) transcript and to constitutive deletion, insertion, and point mutations provide additional support for the translational attenuation model for induction of macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B resistance.
