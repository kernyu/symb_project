Three clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, which were previously shown to contain a 50S plasmid conferring resistance to several aminoglycosides, were examined for modifying enzymes. Both the wild-type and heat-cured derivatives of the isolates were screened for acetyl-, adenylyl-, and phosphotransferase activities. The substrates were gentamicin, amikacin, and netilmicin; the results indicated that even though all three activites were present, the phosphotransferase reaction was most responsible for resistance to these antibiotics. The absence of any of the modifying activites in cured derivatives of the three isolates supports the conclusion that aminoglycoside resistance in these strains is conferred by a plasmid.
