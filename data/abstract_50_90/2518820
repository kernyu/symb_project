Nosocomial Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates were typed by DNA fingerprinting techniques. Chromosomal DNA banding patterns, after endonuclease digestion, of six isolates from a neonatal care unit confirmed the results of O-serotyping and antimicrobial susceptibility pattern analysis. In contrast, the characterization by chromosomal DNA fingerprinting of P. aeruginosa strains isolated from patients treated in a burn unit disagreed with the two classic typing methods: in fact, isolates that varied in serotype and antibiograms showed identical restriction endonuclease profiles, whereas two indistinguishable isolates cultured from individual patients were easily and reproducibly differentiated by molecular analysis.
