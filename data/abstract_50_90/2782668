Data have been compiled concerning insecticide-resistance in native populations of Musca domestica from 10 districts of the GDR for the period between 1976 and 1988. The insecticides tested were trichlorfon, dimethoate, bromophos, and trichlophenidine, i.e. those insecticides commonly used in house fly control on animal production farms. Pyrethrum and permethrin were also tested. Since the test strains were frequently selected in connection with control failures, the data may not be representative for all populations. But they allow some conclusions concerning the development of resistance. A stage of development has been reached which required a departure from the exclusive use of conventional procedures (residual spraying of surfaces with persistent contact pesticides). Intensified research on non-chemical or special chemical methods is urgently needed.
