The DNA sequence of the region located downstream from the kanamycin resistance gene of Tn5 up to the right inverted repeat IS50R has been determined. This completes the determination of the sequence of Tn5 which is 5818 bp long. The 2.7 Kb central region contains three resistance genes: the kanamycin-neomycin resistance gene, a gene coding for resistance to CL990 an antimitotic-antibiotic compound of the bleomycin family and a third gene that confers streptomycin resistance in some bacterial species but is cryptic in E. coli. A Tn5* mutant able to express streptomycin resistance in E. coli was isolated. With this mutant, it was demonstrated that in E. coli the expression of the three resistance genes is coordinated in a single operon.
