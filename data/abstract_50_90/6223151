We conducted a study on the utility in the obstetric and gynecological field of piperacillin (PIPC) which is a broad spectrum penicillin developed here in Japan. After administration of PIPC by intravenous one shot injection or intravenous dripping infusion the yield of PIPC to the various uterine tissues was a favorable 30 approximately 40% in comparison with the serum concentration and the discharge from retroperitoneum was about 100% to 300% in 4 hours. Thus it is thought to be useful in the treatment of infections of the retroperitoneum. During a clinical trial PIPC was administered to 16 patients with obstetrical and gynecological infections and it proved to be excellent in 4 patients, good in 10 patients and ineffective in 2 patients. Thus an overall efficacy rate of 87.5% was obtained. The only side effects observed was a slight transitory abnormality of liver function in 2 patients. Thus in the overall evaluation, this drug was considered to be useful in the treatment of infections in the obstetric and gynecological field.
