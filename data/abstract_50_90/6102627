Clavulanic acid is an inhibitor of certain beta-lactamases, notably those enzymes which inactivate the penicillins and cause resistance of important bacteria to these antibiotics. Microbiological, pharmacological, and clinical studies show that clavulanic acid in combination with amoxycillin is effective and safe in the treatment of urinary-tract infection caused by amoxycillin-resistant bacteria.
