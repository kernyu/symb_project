Pre-exposure of growing bacterial populations to low concentrations of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) protects a repair-proficient strain of Escherichia coli (AB1157) very strongly and a rec A strain (AB2463) to a lesser extent from the lethal action of subsequent exposure to 5 mM H2O2 in buffer. The conditioning procedure also protects AB1157 and AB2463 from the toxic effects of UVA (334 nm, 365 nm) radiation but not UVB (313 nm) or UVC (254 nm) radiations. Pretreatment of growing AB1157 with low fluences of UVA (365 nm) radiation leads to the induction of resistance to H2O2, an effect which apparently requires protein synthesis. As in a previous report, the treatment of growing populations with low concentrations of H2O2 enhanced the resistance of such populations to H2O2 challenge in the growth medium. However, when H2O2 (+ Cu2+)-treated bacteriophage were subsequently infected into AB1157 under optimal inducing conditions, their resistance was not enhanced relative to infection into untreated bacteria. We conclude that the primary mechanism for the inducible effects observed could be the induction of H2O2 scavenging activity by low concentrations of H2O2 either introduced into the growth medium directly or produced by low fluences of UVA irradiation.
