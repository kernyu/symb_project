During the years 1967--1975 a total of 62 patients were treated for postoperative osteomyelitis. The lower extremities had been fractured in 89 per cent of the cases and 54 per cent were closed injuries. The fractures, mostly caused by traffic accidents and falls, had been immobilized by plates in 30 and by intramedullary nails or pins in 25 patients. Staphylococcus aureus was cultured in 80 per cent, 68 per cent of them were resistant to penicillin, but in 84 per cent the organisms were highly lincomycin sensitive and only three patients with four osteomyelitic lesions presented lincomycin resistance. The treatment consisted chiefly of sequestrectomies and saucerizations supported by 3--12 months of lincomycin treatment. In 30 operations a closed irrigation-suction technique was used, perfusing the wound with lincomycin solution. Stable implants should be left in place until the fracture is clinically solid whereas unstable osteosyntheses should be replaced by rigid internal or extraskeletal fixation. At follow-up, the results were judged as good in 74 per cent, fair 8 per cent and poor 18 per cent. The amputation rate was 13 per cent. Plates should not be used in the treatment of comminuted tibial fractures with considerable soft tissue damage.
