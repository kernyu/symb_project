Nine temperature-sensitive (Ts) mutants of Neisseria gonorrhoeae strain 49191 were isolated. They were proven to be different from each other by results of transformation experiments. None of the Ts mutations appeared to be linked to antibiotic resistance genes from strain 24392. However, Ts-9 demonstrated 8% linkage with a nalidixic acid resistance marker from strain RW-2.
