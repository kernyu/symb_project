Transposon Tn9 carrying camr gene which controls resistance to chloramphenicol has been introduced in vivo (in cells of Escherichia coli) into two chimeric shuttle plasmids pYF91 and YEp13. These plasmids consist of the different parts of the E. coli plasmid pBR322, the yeast 2mkm DNA plasmid and the yeast LEU2 structural gene. The plasmidis able to autonomously replicate in both yeast and bacterial cells. A recipient yeast strain carrying cams and leu2 markers was constructed to study the functional expression of the prokaryotic camr gene in eukaryotic yeast cells. The chimeric plasmids pYF91::Tn9 and YEp13::Tn9 were introduced into the yeast and bacterial recipient strains by transformation. The camr LEU2 yeast transformants were isolated. They were genetically unstable when grown on non-selective medium and they simultaneously lost camr and LEU2 markers with a frequency of 10 to 30%. The E. coli transformants were genetically stable under nonselective conditions and they maintain all plasmid markers. The chimeric plasmid pYF91::Tn9 was isolated from the yeast transformants and reintroduced into the cams leuB bacterial strain by transformation. The camr LEUB transformants were obtained. All these data confirm the possibility of the expression of the prokaryotic camr gene in yeast cells and present evidence for introduction of transposon Tn9 into chimeric plasmids.
