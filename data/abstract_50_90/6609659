One hundred and five strains of Salmonella, including 103 clinical isolates, were examined for resistance to beta-lactams (ampicillin, carbenicillin). The resistance frequency was 5.9 and 40.6%, respectively, according to the geographical source: France or Senegal. The mechanism of resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics was always related to the biosynthesis of one constitutive beta-lactamase (beta la+). By analytical isoelectric focusing on gel of all crude sonic extracts, four types of enzymes were identified: TEM-1, TEM-2, OXA-1 and SHV -1. TEM-1, the most prevalent, was observed among 17 serotypes, TEM-2 among 3 including S. poona , and OXA-1 among 2 serotypes. SHV -1 was detected in all isolates of S. ordonez (38) but only among strains of this serotype. Among others factors involved in their distribution, differences were reported according to the geographical origin of the studied strains. In France, the three types, TEM-1, TEM-2 and OXA-1, were isolated only in the north. Moreover, the resistance frequency was 4-fold higher (7.3%) than in the south (1.8%). In Africa (Senegal), three types were individualized: TEM-1, TEM-2 and SHV -1. The SHV -1 type was only detected in clinical isolates of S. ordonez from Senegal, all of which were multi-resistant to other antibiotics (chloramphenicol, sulfonamides and tetracyclines).
