Twenty-three of 43 E. coli and 25 of 39 Klebsiella isolates, resistant to two or more antibiotics, transferred one or more resistance genes to a recipient E. coli K(12) culture. Resistances transferred most frequently by both species were those to kanamycin and neomycin. E. coli cultures transferred resistance to tetracycline, chloramphenicol, ampicillin and carbenicillin, whereas Klebsiella isolates transferred resistance to the first two of these antibiotics. Extrapolation of these results to a larger series of isolations of E. coli and Klebsiella from hospital patients suggested that 21 and 18% respectively of cultures of these two organisms carried potentially transferable resistance.
