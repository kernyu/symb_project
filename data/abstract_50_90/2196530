The microbiological, pharmacokinetic, toxicological and clinical aspects of aminoglycosides are reviewed. Aminoglycosides still have an important place in serious infections in neutropenic patients, endocarditis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections, all in combination with beta-lactams. Monotherapy (with streptomycin) is indicated in less common diseases like tularemia and bubonic plague. Several experimental studies support a once-daily dosing regimen for aminoglycosides (comparable or better efficacy with less ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity). Only a very limited number of prospective comparative studies have been performed, and much more data on efficacy, development of resistance and toxicity is needed before once-daily administration can be recommended. The choice of an aminoglycoside should be based primarily on the local sensitivity patterns and cost. Differences in ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity are usually minor. If the acquisition costs of amikacin decline, it is to be expected that amikacin will be the aminoglycoside of choice.
