Human DNA was used to transform adenosine kinase (AK)-deficient BHK cells followed by selection of AK+ cells in medium containing alanosine, adenosine, and uridine (AAU medium). Twenty AAUr isolates were analyzed, and none of them contained AK activity. Several purine salvage enzymes were, however, found to be affected in these cells. The levels of hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase and adenylosuccinate synthetase activities were elevated, while the adenylosuccinase activity was reduced. AAU-resistance may be explained by elevated activity of adenylosuccinate synthetase to overcome the alanosine block; thus AAUr cells were able to convert exogenous adenosine----inosine----hypoxanthine----IMP----AMPS----AMP. Moreover, these AAUr cells required exogenous purines for growth. HPLC analyses of endogenous nucleotide pools of AAUr cells showed that the levels of adenine nucleotides have diminished to less than 10% of the parental levels. These results suggest that the AAU-resistant mutation, which elicits pleiotropic phenotypes in BHK cells, affects an important component in the regulation of adenine nucleotide synthesis. By including erthyro-9-(2-hydroxy-3-nonyl)adenine in the AAU medium (renamed as AAUE medium) to block deamination of adenosine, AK+ BHK cells were isolated.
