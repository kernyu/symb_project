Tracheal intubation of viable Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 19660 into the lungs of mice had no significant effect on the animals even with administration of organisms as high as 5.0 X 10(9) CFU. Animals treated with a single injection of an antineoplastic drug were, however, susceptible to bacterial challenge into the lungs. LD50 values of 4.1 X 10(7), 4.8 X 10(7), and 1.0 X 10(8) CFU were obtained when animals were simultaneously infected and treated with methotrexate, vincristine sulfate, or cytosine arabinoside, respectively.
