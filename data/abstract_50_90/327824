Previous studies have demonstrated that A23187, an ionophore which selectively transports divalent cations across cell membranes, has profound effects on human erythrocytes: it causes red cells to take up calcium; lose potassium, water, and ATP; convert from biconcave discs to echinocytes and spheroechinocytes; and become more rigid. The present study has explored the influence of calcium uptake induced by the ionophore on the behavior of individual erythrocyte membranes by the micropipette aspiration technique. Exposure of erythrocytes to calcium and A23187 for intervals of up to 30 minutes resulted in marked changes in membrane viscoelastic properties, including the development of increased resistance to aspiration. The most striking manifestation of altered membrane mechanics was apparent after 10 minutes on incubation. Cells pulled into the pipette for a few seconds and the extruded back into the medium retained the deformity imposed by the pipette for several seconds to a few minutes before regaining the form they manifested prior to initial aspiration. The calcium-induced changes in erythrocyte behavior observed in this study strongly support the concept that extrinsic proteins located inside the membrane provide mechanical support to the cell wall, and that increased levels of calcium cause precipitation or cross-linking of the proteins responsible for the increased resistence to deformation and recoil observed after aspiration into micropipettes.
