The antibiogram of 658 S. typhi strains isolated in Moldova during the last 20 years points out that this bacterium is preserving in the studied area its natural sensitivity towards the antibiotics used in the treatment of typhoid fever. A very small number of strains resistant to these antibiotics (below 0.5%) have appeared as an accident without clinico-epidemiological consequences. The MIC unimodal distribution of cloramphenicol and other antibiotics towards S. typhi is similar to the MIC distribution towards the serotypes with very limited circulation (S. java) and much different from the MIC bimodal distribution towards the serotypes having a wide circulation (S. agona). It is considered that the cause of the relative protection of S. typhi strains in Moldova (as a matter of fact in all the country) from the resistance plasmides was only the ever limited circulation of this species. It is opted for the necessity of a surveillance by antibiogramm of the circulating S. typhi strains.
