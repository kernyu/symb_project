The syntheses of 1-N-(S-4-amino-2-hydroxybutyryl)-gentamicin B and 1-N-(S-3-amino-2-hydroxypropionyl)-gentamicin B, designated sch 20287 and Sch 21420, respectively, by procedures similar to those developed by KAWAGUCHI and co-workers for the transformation of kanamycin A to amikacin are described. The in vitro microbiological properties of Sch 20287 and Sch 21420 are compared with amikacin, gentamicin and tobramycin.
