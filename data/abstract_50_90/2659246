Chemotherapeutic management of many of the important protozoal diseases relies upon a relatively small number of compounds, many of which are quite toxic to the host. The increasing appearance of organisms resistant to standard therapy confounds this problem. The development of new efficacious therapies depends on the evaluation of drug activities both in vitro and in vivo. The use of axenic cultivation methods and cell culture techniques has greatly aided efforts to study drug effects on protozoa in vitro, although standardization of susceptibility tests is lacking.
