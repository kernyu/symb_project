Measurement of metabolic CO2 by head space gas chromatography was used in the preparation of shelf-life maps of fruit-based systems. The systems analysed, all of which were peach-based, differed with respect to aw (0.995, 0.934 and 0.890), pH (3.02, 3.60 and 4.09) and benzoic acid concentration (0, 100 and 200 ppm). The test microorganism was a strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae isolated from spoiled soft-drinks and chosen for its characteristic of multiple resistance. Three different thermal treatments were applied (54 degrees C for 15 min, 58 degrees C for 8 min, 63 degrees C for 3 min) to the systems and their effectiveness was evaluated in relation to the untreated controls. In contrast with observations for osmotolerant species, the relative preservative effectiveness on the test strain decreased with reducing aw and showed only a slight synergistic action with thermal treatment. Besides, the aw of the systems interacted synergistically with the thermal treatment effectiveness in a manner differing from that described for osmotolerant species.
