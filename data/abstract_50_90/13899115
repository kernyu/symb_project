The production of an interferon-like substance by vaccinia virus is described. The physical properties of vaccinia interferon are shown to be similar to those of previously reported interferons. Data defining the role of vaccinia interferon in cell resistance and in establishment and maintenance of a carrier culture are presented. Elimination of virus from an infected culture is demonstrated and the role of interferon in the recovery process is considered.
