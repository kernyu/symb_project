Ceftizoxime suppositories (CZX-S) were given to 5 children comprising 3 with acute bronchitis, 1 with acute bronchitis complicated by enteritis, and 1 with acute urinary tract infection, in doses of 12.5 12.5-17.4 mg/kg with 1 suppository containing 125 mg or 250 mg (potency) given 3 times a day. The clinical response was "markedly effective" in 2 and "effective" in 3. Microbiologically CZX-S caused a eradication of 1 strain each of S. aureus and E. coli and caused a decrease of organisms in 1 strain of S. aureus. There were no adverse reactions or abnormal laboratory test findings attributable to CZX-S. In conclusion, CZX-S proved to be a clinically useful antibiotic preparation for the treatment of infection in children not suited to treatment with oral or intravenous preparations.
