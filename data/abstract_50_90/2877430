Spiroplasmas are helical mycoplasmas that play a significant role in plant diseases. They are also found in arthropods that are likely to bite humans, such as ticks and mosquitoes. These arthropods can act as vectors and therefore may be of epidemiologic significance. Furthermore, mainly on the grounds of morphologic evidence, spiroplasmas have been incriminated in the genesis of human Creutzfeld-Jacob disease. We recovered six strains of Spiroplasma sp. from 1927 female mosquitoes. In vitro susceptibility of each strain to the following antibiotics was studied: tetracycline, oxytetracycline, doxycycline, erythromycin, chloramphenicol, rifampin, kanamycin, gentamicin and pefloxacin. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined by dilution in liquid SP4 medium using microtiter plates. Plates were incubated for 24 to 48 hours at 30 degrees C. The inoculum contained approximately 5 X 10(5) CFU/ml. Each of the six strains was found to be highly susceptible to tetracycline, oxytetracycline, doxycycline, erythromycin, chloramphenicol and pefloxacin (MICs less than or equal to 0.16 microgram/ml, 0.63 microgram/ml, 0.08 microgram/ml, 0.16 microgram/ml and 0.32 microgram/ml respectively). On the opposite, the strains exhibited resistance to rifampin and variable degrees of susceptibility to kanamycin (12.5 micrograms/ml less than MIC less than 50 micrograms/ml) and gentamicin (3.12 micrograms/ml less than MIC less than 50 micrograms/ml). From our results, spiroplasmas seem to have more or less the same susceptibility to antibiotics as mycoplasmas.
