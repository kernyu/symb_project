Herpes simplex virus was grown in different lines of human tumor and normal cells. The progeny virus was assayed for resistance to iododeoxycytidine, an indicator of a forward mutation in the virus genome. Virus grown in cells from 4 of 5 tumor lines demonstrated greater fractions mutated to iododeoxycytidine resistance than did virus grown in 7 normal human skin cell lines. The data indicate that some lines of human tumor cells modify the herpesvirus replication process, making it more mutagenic. In 2 cases of osteosarcoma patients, normal skin fibroblasts of the patients yielded normal levels of mutagenesis, while their tumor cells gave enhanced mutagenesis.
