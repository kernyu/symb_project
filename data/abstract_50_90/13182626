Six patients with acne conglobata were treated with cortisone and adrenocorticotropic hormone. Definite immediate improvement was observed in all of them. In three cases control of the disease was maintained on relatively low doses of steroid. In one case there was response to superficial x-ray therapy after the acute phase of the disease had subsided in response to steroids. Resistance to steroid therapy apparently developed in one patient after approximately 18 months of treatment. One patient responded to treatment and then remained well (for two months when last observed) although steroids and all other treatment were discontinued. The combined use of antibiotics and steroids in the patients treated gave the best results.
