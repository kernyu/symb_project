Imipenem/cilastatin is highly effective for infections in many body sites against a broad range of gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. During therapy, development of resistance is uncommon except in the case of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in which the incidence appears similar to that for other beta-lactam antibiotics. There appears to be a very low probability of cross-resistance. The clinical and laboratory adverse reactions are similar in type to those for other beta-lactam antibiotics. The frequency of colonization and superinfection during treatment with imipenem/cilastatin has been comparable to other antibiotics in comparative trials and to literature reports for other antibiotics for noncomparative trials.
