Six hundred and ten Salmonella strains isolated from children with the gastrointestinal form of salmonellosis were investigated for their species composition and sensitivity to broad spectrum antibiotics, such as levomycetin, polymyxin, kanamycin, gentamicin and others. The agar diffusion method with paper disks was used in the investigation. S. typhimurium predominated in the etiological picture of salmonellosis in children and amounted to 72.5 per cent. Then followed S. stenleyvile (15.1 per cent). Salmonella of rare serovars amounted only to 14.2 per cent. The Salmonella strains were resistant to the majority of the antibiotics tested. The highest resistance levels were observed in S. stenleyvile and S. typhimurium. Salmonella of the rare serovars were more sensitive to the antibiotics. More than 80 per cent of the Salmonella strains were polyresistant to 6-8 antibiotics. This indicates that antibioticograms should be considered in the treatment of children with salmonellosis.
