Rats preferring ethanol differ from those preferring water in a lowered blood serum IRI level in the presence of the same level of glycemia. Ethanol preferring animals are characterized by raised function of the adrenal cortex revealed in an elevated II-oxycordicosteroid content in these glands and a lowered cholesterol level. The glucose tolerance test (4 g/kg by intragastric administration) shows a faster depletion of beta-cells of langerhans islets in ethanol preferring animals which is suggestive of a prediabetic state. A different sensitivity of the insular apparatus to glucose is noted in the study group, too. As for glycemia, rats preferring ethanol demonstrate greater resistance to 48-hour starvation as compared to rats preferring water.
