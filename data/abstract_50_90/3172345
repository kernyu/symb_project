I infected different human leukemic cell lines with an amphotropic retrovirus vector (designated PA317/N2) which confers G418 resistance and contains the Moloney murine leukemia virus long terminal repeat. In retrovirus-infected G418-resistant HL-60 cells, induction of granulocyte differentiation by retinoic acid was invariably accompanied by a marked increase (5- to 10-fold) in the transcriptional activity of the integrated retroviral long terminal repeat.
