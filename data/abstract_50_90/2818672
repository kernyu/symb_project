Lomefloxacin (1-ethyl-6,8-difluoro-1,4-dihydro-7-(3-methyl-1-piperazinyl)-4- oxoquinoline-3-carboxylic acid monohydrochloride, SC-47111) is a broad-spectrum antibiotic of the 4-quinolone group. In this comparative study the antimicrobial in-vitro activity of lomefloxacin was tested against 863 gram-negative and 415 gram-positive strains from fresh clinical isolates. As comparative agents ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin and ofloxacin were used. The minimal inhibitory concentrations were determined by means of a serial dilution with the agar-dilution procedure. Lomefloxacin showed an antibacterial efficacy comparable to other quinolones. Ciprofloxacin in general was two-fold dilutions more active. No cross-resistance with beta-lactamase producing-methicillin resistant or aminoglycoside-, tetracycline-, chloramphenicol- and co-trimoxacol-resistant strains could be found. Lomefloxacin showed in this study a broad antimicrobial activity. The clinical utilities of this new fluoroquinolone will depend on the pharmacokinetic properties and the adverse event profile.
