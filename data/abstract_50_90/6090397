A procedure was developed to isolate insertions of transposon Tn551 near other markers of interest on the chromosome of Staphylococcus aureus NCTC 8325. When an inoculum of strain 8325-4 carrying a thermosensitive mutant of plasmid pI258 (on which Tn551 resides) was inoculated into brain heart infusion agar plus erythromycin and grown to saturation at 43 degrees C, the transforming DNA extracted from this population of cells contained a random collection of different chromosomal insertions of Tn551; this DNA is referred to as pooled Tn551 DNA. When erythromycin-sensitive recipient strains containing chromosomal markers of interest were transformed with pooled Tn551 DNA, and the resulting Emr transformants were screened for coinheritance of the donor allele of the marker of interest, insertions of Tn551 were isolated near several markers, including fus-149, tet-3490, mec-4916, pig-131, ilv-129, pur-140, and uraA141. Many of the insertions were within the linkage groups that contained these markers, and several insertions occupied different positions between the linkage groups in heretofore undefined regions of the circular chromosomal map of S. aureus. These insertions of transposon Tn551 extend the known limits of the existing linkage groups, provide linkage data and map locations for markers not previously mapped, and provide a means to map markers which cannot be directly selected.
