This study was designed to compare the in vitro activities of recent cephalosporins and other beta-lactams. One of our objectives was to determine whether the microbiologist could use a single cephalosporin for routine antibiotic sensitivity testing. All the strains studied were recovered from outpatients. Sensitivity and/or resistance were evaluated by MIC determination, according to a program developed in our laboratory, using a personal computer. Using special programs, patterns of activities of beta-lactams were determined quantitatively and graphically for each bacterial strain tested. For most strains ceftriaxone, and to a lesser extent moxalactam and cefoperazone, exhibited greater antibacterial activity than the other beta-lactams, except against group D streptococci. For Enterobacteriaceae, cefadroxil is satisfactory in screening for in vitro activity of cephalosporins.
