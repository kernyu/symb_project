An exposure of a human myeloma cell line to 2-difluoromethylornithine the mechanism-based inhibitor of ornithine decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.17), resulted in a selection of tumor cells readily growing in the presence of 4 mM difluoromethylornithine, a concentration that swiftly halted the growth of the parental cells. Determination of the intracellular polyamines revealed that there were measurable amounts of putrescine and spermidine in the resistant cells. Restriction enzyme analyses of genomic DNA isolated from the resistant cells indicated that the gene dosage for ornithine decarboxylase was not increased to any appreciable extent. Similarly, the accumulation of mRNA was unaltered. The resistant myeloma cells, however, displayed arginase (EC 3.5.3.1) activity that was roughly ten times higher than that in the parental cells.
