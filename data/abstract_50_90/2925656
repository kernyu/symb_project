Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) can inhibit the differentiation of preadipocytes to adipocytes and will revert differentiated adipocytes to the preadipocyte state. TNF is not toxic to either adipocytes or preadipocytes when used alone but is highly toxic to these cells when used in conjunction with cycloheximide, yielding virtually 100% killing within 4-6 h of treatment. A cell line (TA1 R-6) was isolated which is resistant to the combined toxic effects of TNF and cycloheximide. This cell line is stable and, unlike the parental cell line, does not morphologically differentiate to adipocytes or express adipocyte-specific mRNAs. It has a more transformed appearance and growth pattern and, while resistant to the toxic effects of TNF and cycloheximide in a 6-h assay, has become sensitive to cytotoxicity induced by TNF used alone in a 3-day assay. The adipocyte differentiation-inducing agents, dexamethasone and indomethacin, block the cytotoxicity induced by TNF alone in the TA1 R-6 line but do not block the rapid cytotoxicity of TNF and cycloheximide in the parental line. These results provide both genetic and pharmacologic evidence that there are at least two distinct or overlapping pathways by which TNF mediates its effects.
