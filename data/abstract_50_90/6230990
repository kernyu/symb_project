Penicillinase-producing Neisseria gonorrhoeae has increased in the Far East to the point that penicillin can no longer be recommended as the drug of choice, mandating a change to spectinomycin. As part of an ongoing surveillance of antibiotic susceptibilities, minimal inhibitory concentrations of penicillin, tetracycline, spectinomycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, cefoxitin, ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, and moxalactam were determined. A disturbing, steady increase in resistance to spectinomycin was documented.
