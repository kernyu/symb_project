Mutant mouse lymphoma cells that overproduce ornithine decarboxylase have been generated by selection for resistance to difluoromethylornithine, an inhibitor of the enzyme. Starting with wild type S49 mouse lymphoma cells, sensitive to growth inhibition by 10 microM difluoromethylornithine, we obtained the Z.12 line, which is approximately 100 times more resistant to that drug (McConlogue, L., and Coffino, P. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 8384-8388). Subsequent selection for still higher levels of resistance was applied to the Z.12 cells and resulted in the generation of the D4.1 line, resistant to 10 mM difluoromethylornithine. The relative synthesis of ornithine decarboxylase in wild type, Z.12, and D4.1 cells was assessed by pulse labeling these cells with [35S]methionine and analyzing the radiolabeled proteins directly, or after immunoprecipitation, on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. As shown previously, the rate of ornithine decarboxylase synthesis is augmented in Z.12 as compared to wild type. In D4.1 cells, the rate of synthesis of ornithine decarboxylase exceeds that of any other single protein; about 15% of total protein synthesis is devoted to the enzyme. The relative amounts of translatable ornithine decarboxylase mRNA in each cell line was determined by in vitro translation of extracted RNA. These results showed that the relative rate of synthesis in each cell line is a reflection of the cell's relative content of translatable ornithine decarboxylase mRNA. Examination of the chromosomes of wild type and D4.1 cells revealed that the former are pseudodiploid and the latter tetraploid. Two of the four chromosomes 14 in D4.1 contain large homogeneously staining regions, a finding consistent with the presence of regions of gene amplification.
