The therapeutic efficacy of six beta-lactam and aminoglycoside antibiotics were compared in diabetic mice with experimentally induced Klebsiella pneumoniae pneumonia. beta-Lactams caused a reduction in the numbers of bacteria, with clearance of bacteria from the lungs of diabetic and normal mice. The effect in diabetic mice, however, was very poor. In contrast thereto, no remarkable difference was seen between diabetic and normal mice when treated with aminoglycosides. The concentration of the test antibiotics to the lungs in diabetic mice was lower than in normal mice. The aminoglycosides were more effective than the beta-lactams. These data suggest that in treating acute and more chronic forms of pulmonary infection caused by K. pneumoniae in diabetic mice aminoglycoside antibiotics are particularly valuable, whereas beta-lactams must be given in large quantities using multiple administrations.
