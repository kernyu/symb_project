Trypanosoma cruzi epimastigotes actively metabolize metronidazole under aerobic conditions to a polar compound tentatively identified as 2-methyl-5-nitroimidazole-1-yl-acetic acid. The rate of metabolite formation is increased by more than 50% by pretreatment with phenobarbital and inhibited by SKF-525A and metyrapone. The reaction is dramatically stimulated by the addition of flavone which suggests that the metabolite is produced via the cytochrome P-450 system. Apparently the nitro group in the metabolite is maintained intact. Detoxication reactions catalyzed by cytochrome P-450 appear to be more important than previously suspected as a basis to explain at least partially the resistance of these organisms to known antimicrobial agents. However, other factors such as the fate of nitro substituent in metronidazole require further evaluation.
