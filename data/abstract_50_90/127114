RSU2, a plasmid transmissible between strains of P. aeruginosa but not to Escherichia coli can be mobilized by R751. Conjugatants receive a single plasmid composed of DNA from both R751 and RSU2 which has the compatibility properties of a member of group P (like R751). Study of this fusion plasmid suggests that the failure of RSU2 to transfer into enterobacteria is due to an inability to replicate in these bacteria. The fusion plasmid replicates using the genes of R751.
