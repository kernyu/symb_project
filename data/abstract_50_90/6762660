The destruction of amoxycillin by beta-lactamase action represents an important mechanism of bacterial resistance to the drug. Data is presented to illustrate that clavulanic acid used in the form of its potassium salt inhibits the amoxycillin destroying action of many different types of beta-lactamase for example: the staphylococcal enzyme, the clinically important plasmid mediated enzymes of the TEM, SHV, OXA and PSE types and the chromosomally controlled enzymes produced by Proteus mirabilis and Klebsiella pneumoniae. The mechanisms by which clavulanic acid inhibits beta-lactamases and potentiates the antibacterial action of amoxycillin are discussed.
