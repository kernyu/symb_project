We evaluated 31 fungal specimens obtained from equine corneas over a 10-year period, 1973 to 1983. More than half were received in late summer and early autumn, and the number tended to increase in frequency during the 1980s. These isolates included 13 different genera and 20 different species. The prevalent genus was Aspergillus (35%). On the basis of examinations for tube-dilution minimal inhibitory concentrations and minimal fungicidal concentrations of 16 fungal isolates, the imidazole antibiotics such as miconazole and ketoconazole consistently showed the lowest geometric mean titers for filamentous fungi. Because fungal sensitivities varied considerably among different species in vitro sensitivity testing is suggested as an aid in the determination of optimal therapy.
