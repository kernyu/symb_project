Bacteriological examinations were made on quarter samples from cows in 35 herds over a 3 year period to monitor the response in a mastitis control program. Initially, Staphylococcus aureus predominated in 32 of the herds and the mean herd prevalence was 26%. The control measures halved this rate but there was considerable variation in response between herds. The decline occurred rapidly and there was a significant reduction (P less than 0.01) by 3 months. Streptococcus agalactiae predominated in 3 herds and the overall infection rate was 4.9%. Control measures eliminated the infection completely from most herds but reinfection occurred in 2 herds. The greatest decline occurred in the first 6 months and was significant (P less than 0.05). The measures had little effect upon Str. uberis and Str. dysgalactiae which remained fairly consistently at low levels. Initially, strains of Staph. aureus resistant to penicillin were dominant in most herds. In a minority of herds strains resistant to streptomycin predominated and in these herds there was a concurrent resistance to penicillin. These patterns did not change greatly over the control period. Resistance by Str. agalactiae to streptomycin occurred in most herds at the start of the program.
