The sensitivity of protein and aurodox synthesis to aurodox was examined in relationship to the development of resistance to aurodix on Streptomyces goldiniensis during fermentation. It was found that the culture remains sensitive to the antibiotic as long as no aurodox is present in the medium. Resistance only develops when aurodox is present, either exogenously added or endogenously synthesized by the culture. These observations suggest that the development of resistance is an inducible process, and evidence is presented indicating that aurodox induces a specific resistance system in S. goldiniensis.
