Glucose compounds were synthesized and tested for resistance in a 48-h in vitro rumen fermentation. Glucose complexed with formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, and acetone was resistant. When complexed with propionic and succinic acids, the products readily fermented. The resistant compounds also withstood acid hydrolysis at a pH similar to that of the abomasum. This suggests that these products would have little value as a dietary source of glucose for ruminants if the release of glucose to the animal depended on acid hydrolysis in the abomasum. The possibility of enzymatic hydrolysis of glucose-formaldehyde compound was studied in a feeding trial with sheep. Eight Finncross wethers were fed the formaldehyde product in three quantities in their diet. Blood and urine glucose plus blood, urine, and fecal total soluble carbohydrate were measured. It appears that this glucose-formaldehyde product resists rumen fermentation but does not become metabolically available to sheep as indicated by large quantities of product excreted in urine and feces.
