Procedures with potential value for identification and purification of Mycoplasma were applied to over 240 cultures representing 11 of the 12 known avian serotypes. Growth was tested at pH 5.5 and 9.5, at 25 and 42 C, in serum-free media, and in the presence of (i) 1% bile salts, (ii) 3% NaCl, and (iii) 0.02% methylene blue. One avian Mycoplasma serotype grew in broth containing 1% bile salts. Two of 11 avian serotypes were resistant to 0.02% methylene blue. A number of Mycoplasma strains grew at 42 C or in a pH 9.5 medium. Usefulness of these procedures for purifying cultures of Mycoplasma is discussed.
