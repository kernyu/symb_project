Derivatives of bacteriophages fd which transduce kanamycin resistance were selected after growth of the phage in an E. coli strain that carried transpoon 5 (Tn5). Different clones of transducing phage and their DNAs were characterized by gel electrophoresis, electron microscopy, and by their ability to multiply in the absence of helper phage. Integration of the intact transposon into the full size phage genome was correlated with an increase in size of the phage particle from 0.95 mu to 1.7 mu, and with the appearance in the phage DNA of the stem loop structure characteristic for single-stranded Tn5 DNA. In non-defective phages the site of insertion was mapped by heteroduplex analysis within the intergenic region of the phage genome. Defective transducing phages were characterized as an insertion of Tn5 into a phage gene, and/or as a partial deletion or duplication of phage and transposon DNA. The size of the transducing phage from different defective clones varied from 0.6 mu to 3.0 mu and was directly proportional to the DNA content. These results demonstrate that filamentous bacteriophage are highly capable to replicate and package very different amounts of foreign DNA.
