Camp and Smith strains of the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum became resistant to mefloquine after continuous cultivation in the presence of the drug. The 50% inhibitory dose (ID(50)) values for mefloquine, as assessed by [(3)H]hypoxanthine incorporation, were found to have increased 4-fold, from 3 mug/l to 12 mug/l. The ID(50) values obtained by morphological examination of the cultures increased 10-fold. Resistance was stable in both strains either when grown in a drug-free medium or when kept frozen in liquid nitrogen. The mefloquine-resistant Camp strain remained sensitive to chloroquine and amodiaquine, and became slightly more resistant to quinine; there was increased sensitivity to pyrimethamine. The mefloquine-resistant Smith strain remained sensitive to amodiaquine and resistant to pyrimethamine; there was increased resistance to quinine, and an increase in sensitivity to chloroquine.
