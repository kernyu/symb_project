The determinant of resistance to fosfomycin of the Serratia marcescens plasmid pOU900 was transposed into the plasmid ColE1 and into the plasmid RP4 in the absence of the RecA function of the host. In each case, the acquisition of fosfomycin resistance was correlated with the presence of a discrete piece of DNA, uniform in size and in restriction pattern, This new, 7.5-megadalton transposable element encoding resistance to fosfomycin has been called Tn2921. A preliminary map of the transposon is presented.
