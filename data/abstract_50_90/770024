During the period from 1969 to 1973, a rectal swabs from 13.943 diarrhea patients of all ages were examined by bacteriological surveys. From these specimens, 981 strains of Shigella were isolated. The most commonly encounted were Shigella flexneri 2. All of strains of Shigella isolated were highly resistant to Aureomycin, Tetracyclin, Terramycin, Novobiocin and Chloramphenicol. There has been an increase in the development of multiresistance of Shigella. Colimycin and Streptomycin were the most effective antibiotics. The greatest number of Shigella were isolated among children under 2 years and during the driest months (March, April, May, June).
