The authors report two additional cases of malaria due to chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium falciparum, one from Tanzania, the other from Kenya. In addition to the in vivo observations, these strains were thoroughly investigated by chloroquine assay and evaluation of ED50 using an original method (in vitro semi-microtest).
