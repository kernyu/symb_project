Vinblastine-sensitive (CCRF-CEM) and -resistant (CEM/VLB100) human T-cell lymphoblasts were treated with the lysosomotropic agent chloroquine. As measured by growth inhibition, this drug enhanced the cytotoxicity of vinblastine in the CEM/VLB100 cells but was less effective in the CCRF-CEM cells. Chloroquine also enhanced the cytotoxic activity of vincristine, daunorubicin and doxorubicin and, to a lesser extent, teniposide (VM-26) in the CEM/VLB100 cells. Histological examination revealed that the vinblastine-resistant cells contained more cytoplasmic vacuoles than their drug-sensitive counter-parts. When the CEM/VLB100 cells were treated with chloroquine, vinblatine, or a combination of the two, the cells displayed many more cytoplasmic vacuoles than the controls. Coincident with the increased number of vacuoles, these treated cells stained more intensely than controls for the lysosomal enzyme, acid phosphatase, but not for lipid. The vacuolization did not increase as much in the CCRF-CEM cell line when these cells were exposed to the chloroquine + vinblastine combination. Vacuolization was also associated with vincristine, doxorubicin, and daunorubicin treatments, but not with VM-26. We conclude that chloroquine is a modulator of anticancer drug action in the CEM/VLB100 cell line.
