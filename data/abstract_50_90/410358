A possibility of conjugation transfer of the markers of the plasmid resistance to gentamicin and other antibiotics from 10 clinical strains of Ps. aeruginosa, isolated from burn patients to the recipient strain of Ps. aeruginosa PTO 629 Rfr was shown. The marker of gentamicin resistance was transferred to 100 out of 110 of the exconjugants, i.e. 86.2 per cent. The rate of the conjugation transfer in the crosses between the clincal strains of Ps. aeruginosa and the recipient strain PTO 629 Rfr with respect to the gentamicin marker was about 10--7. The plasmid resistance markers in the clincal strains Ps. aeruginosa were transferred in various combinations. Transfer of the markers of resistance to streptomycin, carbenicillin, neomycin and combinations Sm, Nm and Sm, Nm, Cm was not achieved.
