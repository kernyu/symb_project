The aroA gene of Klebsiella pneumoniae encoding the shikimate pathway enzyme 5-enolpyruvylshikimate 3-phosphate (EPSP) synthase, which is the target of the herbicide glyphosate, was cloned and sequenced from both the wild-type and the glyphosate-resistant mutant K. pneumoniae K1, which possesses a glyphosate-insensitive EPSP synthase. Both genes were expressed in Escherichia coli and were capable of complementing an auxotrophic aroA mutation. The transformed cells showed increased tolerance to glyphosate due to the overproduction of either the mutant or the wild type EPSP synthase. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the K. pneumoniae aroA gene indicated a protein-coding region of 427 amino acids with a derived Mr for the EPSP synthase of 45,976. Comparison of the two aroA alleles showed a single base change resulting in a substitution of Gly-96 to Ala in the deduced amino acid sequence. By comparison with other known EPSP synthase sequences the mutation was shown to be located in a highly conserved region, indicating that this region is essential for the binding of the herbicide glyphosate.
