The binding of polynucleotides or of their vinyl analogs to human fibroblasts is changed when complexes are formed between these compounds. The following polymers have been studied: poly(1-vinylcytosine), poly(1-vinyluracil, poly(9-vinyladenine), polyuridylate, polyadenylate and polyinosinate. Only that complex formation (between poly(1-vinylcytosine) and polyinosinate) which is accompanied by aggregation leads to a considerable increase (30 fold) in binding to cells; all the other complex formations have only moderate effects (0.2-3 fold). Furthermore, a comparison of unordered complexes containing polyinosinate whows that enhanced binding to cells is paralleled by an increased cellular resistance to viral infection.
