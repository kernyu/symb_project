All over the world nosocomial infections are increasing at an enormous rate. With 30% urology takes second place, after intensive care units. Nearly 40% of these infections start in the lower urinary tract, and more than 7% are the direct cause of death. Attention is drawn to the increased financial burden caused by these complications. A consideration of the causes (above all uncritical use of antibiotics for prophylaxis and therapy) is followed by a discussion of the success of a change in policy concerning antibiotics and improved hospital hygiene in our own department. Lessening the selective pressure led to a very significant reduction of nosocomial problem germs and an increase in germ sensitivity, besides saving up to 80% of antibiotics.
