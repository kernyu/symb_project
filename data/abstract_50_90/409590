Using the biophotometer with ticarcillin no persistent bactericidal effect was found against Pseudomonas aeruginosa NCTC 10490. After addition of 1.2 microgram/ml gentamicin an increase of multiplication of bacteria was observed, but not after 1.2 microgram/ml tobramycin. With 6.2 microgram/ml tobramycin bactericidal effects lasted more than 24 h. In tube dilution test with Isotonic Sensi-test Broth out of 109 examined strains 51% were resistant to gentamicin, 16% to tobramycin and 4.5% to ticarcillin. If MIC values of gentamicin and tobramycin were calculated for magnesium-free media the resistance rate would be 10% for gentamicin and 3% for tobramycin. Combining subinhibitory doses of gentamicin or tobramycin with ticarcillin, most of the strains resistant to gentamicin and tobramycin became susceptible. The rate of inactivation of tobramycin by ticarcillin depends on the fluid into which they are placed. In combination therapy both antibiotics should be applied separately and immediately one after the other.
