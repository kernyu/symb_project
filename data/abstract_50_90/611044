Riboflavin deficient mutant Pichia guilliermondii MS1 which requires approximately 1000-fold lower concentration of exogenous vitamin B2 for growth when compared with a non-adapted riboflavin deficient mutants of this species was isolated by means of of UV-irradiation. The growth of the mutant was strongly inhibited by actinomycin D and L-canavanine. The revertant MS8 and MS14 which synthesized riboflavin were selected from the strain MS1. These revertants posses a multiple sensitivity to actinomycin D, rifamycin, euflavine, mitomycin C, antimycin A, 8-azaadenine, 8-azaguanine, L-canavanine and 7-methyl-8-trifluoromethyl-10-(1'-D-ribityl)isoalloxazine. The ability to utilized glycerol and ethanol as a sole carbon source for growth was impaired in these mutants. The mutants which can utilize glycerol were isolated from the strain MS14. Such mutants were resistant to actonomycin D. Mutation (s) which determines a multiple sensitivity and inability to utilized glycerol was recessive.
