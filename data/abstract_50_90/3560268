Acute changes in hemodynamic and electrophysiologic indices were measured following blunt cardiac trauma, oral ethanol, and a combination of both in dogs. Impacts with a velocity of 10 m/sec and a contact compression of 5 cm were delivered to most of the pericardium. Transient arrhythmias in impacted animals resulted in significant reductions in all hemodynamic responses at 15 minutes post-impact. Intragastric doses of 50% ethanol/distilled water yielded average blood alcohol concentrations of 60 +/- 10 mg%, 120 +/- 20 mg%, and 180 +/- 15 mg%. Alcohol effected significant reductions in dp/dt and cardiac index and elevations in total peripheral resistance during treatment. Alcohol and trauma resulted in per cent mortalities of 17, 50, and 71% for each such group primarily from electrical-mechanical dissociation. Surviving animals experienced significant declines in dp/dt, cardiac index, and mean aortic pressure at 15 minutes post-impact. Mean aortic pressure remained depressed while dp/dt, cardiac index, and total peripheral resistance returned to control values.
