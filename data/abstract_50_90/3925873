The increasing role of antibiotic-resistant microorganisms in etiology of bacterial infections and the increased number of the antibiotics used for the treatment of patients with purulent infections require a rational approach to the choice of the optimal drug. Antibiotic sensitivity of the causative agents of bacterial infections is considered at present as one of the main indices determining the efficacy of antibacterial therapy. Determination of antibiotic sensitivity by the disk diffusion method with quantitative and semi-quantitative interpretation of the results provides information for choosing the most effective drug and calculating its optimal dose in control therapy. Equations for calculating the MICs antibiotics by the inhibition growth zones and the drug levels in blood and urine attained with the use of different doses and administration routes are presented.
