This study was undertaken to establish whether resistance to benzimidazole anthelmintics was present in gastrointestinal nematodes of sheep and goats at the university farm of Sokoine University of Agriculture, Morogoro, Tanzania. Groups of lambs were treated with albendazole at 3.8 mg/kg (recommended dose rate), 5.6 mg/kg and 10.0 mg/kg and a fourth group was untreated. Seven days after treatment, faecal egg count reductions (FECR) were found to be 94.3%, 97.6% and 99.3% and 14 days after treatment FECR of the same groups were 83.0%, 81.3% and 99.6%, respectively. Larval cultures indicated that only H. contortus were present in post-treatment samples. This strain of H. contortus, (DASP) and another strain of H. contortus (MKATA), considered susceptible to anthelmintics, were used in an experimental in vivo study and for an in vitro egg hatch assay. Treatment with fenbendazole at the recommended dose of groups of lambs infected with either strains showed no reduction in the DASP strain and a 70.5% reduction in the MKATA strain. The in vitro egg hatch assay established a significant difference (p less than 0.05) in hatchability of eggs of the two strains. The development of the high level of resistance to fenbendazole in the DASP strain is related to the history of anthelmintic usage and management of sheep and goats at the university farm.
