The plasmid pNov2, carrying a cloned chromosomal marker conferring resistance to at least 2.5 micrograms of novobiocin per ml, was constructed with a new Haemophilus influenzae cloning vehicle, pDM2. The novobiocin marker of pNov2 was not normally expressed, but in Rec+ cells approximately one in 10(4) cells in a culture of a transformant became novobiocin resistant, a frequency about four orders of magnitude higher than the spontaneous mutation frequency. Variants of such cells that had lost the plasmid were also novobiocin resistant. Since Rec- cultures bearing pNov2 showed novobiocin resistance only at the normal mutation frequency, we concluded that the Rec+ novobiocin-resistant transformants arose because of a rare recombination between plasmid and chromosome in which the chromosome acquired the novobiocin marker from the plasmid. Evidence is presented that novobiocin sensitivity is dominant over this particular novobiocin resistance marker.
