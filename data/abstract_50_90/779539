The effect of chlortetracycline given at a concentration of 220.5 g/metric ton of feed and of a combination product which supplies chlortetracycline (110.2 g/metric ton), sulfamethazine (110.2 g/metric ton), and penicilin G (55.1 g/metric ton) on the occurrence and persistence of Salmonella typhimurium in experimentally infected swine was studied. Weanling pigs (av weight, 8.2 kg) were inoculated via the feed with 10(11) colony-forming units of S typhimurium 298-1NA. An equal number of nonexposed swine given identical treatment were used as controls. Infected pigs had increased temperatures (maximal av, 41 C) for the first 4 days after infection and severe diarrhea during the first 21 days. The use of chlortetracycline and a combination product at subtherapeutic concentrations in feed did not increase the Salmonella pool or prolong the carrier state in swine. A decrease in number of Salmonella shed from swine given chlortetracycline at the concentration of 220.5 g/metric ton was observed. Significant differences did not occur in Salmonella-related deaths or in emergence of multiple antibiotic-resistant Salmonella by antibiotic selection or R factor transfer. Zoonotic transmission of the infecting Salmonella to animal caretakers was not detected.
