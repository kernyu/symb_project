Localized and generalized infections in newborns nowadays are mostly due to gram negative bacteria (E. coli, Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Pseudomonas pyocyanea, Serratia marcescens et al.). Unspecific treatment causes an increasing rate of resistance, as shown by an account of our own experiences. Tobramycin, Gentamycin, and Cefazolin appear to be particularly promising antibiotics to avoid the development of resistance though their pharmacokinetics in the newborn have to be considered carefully. Based on the determination of serum levels of Tobramycin and Amoxycillin in newborns general recommendations for the dosage of these new antibiotics are given.
