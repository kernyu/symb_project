The Ti-plasmids are naturally self-transmissible from their normal host Agrobacterium to E. coli. They are however unable to stably establish themselves as a replicon in E. coli. It is nevertheless possible to study the Ti-plasmids in E. coli with the help of Ti::RP4 cointegrate plasmids that transfer and maintain themselves very efficiently in E. coli. An E. coli harbouring such a Ti::RP4 plasmid is unable to catabolize octopine and unable to induce crown-gall tumours on plants.
