Laboratory and clinical studies were performed as follows on aztreonam (AZT), a new monobactam antibiotic. Pharmacokinetics Serum concentrations of AZT were measured in 1 patient given 20 mg/kg by intravenous bolus injection. The peak concentration was 100 micrograms/ml at 15 minutes, and T 1/2 was 1.85 hours. Clinical efficacy AZT was administrated intravenously to 10 patients in doses of 59.2-170.7 mg/kg (average 76.1 mg/kg) t.i.d. for 3-8 days (average 5.3 days); 5 with pneumonia, 1 with bronchitis, 1 with lymphadenitis, 1 with sepsis (suspected) and 2 with urinary tract infections. The overall efficacy rate was 80%, i.e., efficacy was excellent in 5, good in 3, fair in 1 and poor in 1. Bacteriological efficacy was excellent, i.e., 4 of 4 Gram-negative strains disappeared. Any clinical side effects and laboratory abnormalities were not observed. The above results suggest that AZT is a useful antibiotic for treating pediatric bacterial infections, especially due to Gram-negative bacteria.
