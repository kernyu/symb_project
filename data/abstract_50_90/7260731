Ether, ethanol and aqueous extracts of ginseng were serially prepared from Korean ginseng plants. Each extract in the dose of 40 mg/kg was administered intravenously to ten dogs under light halothane anesthesia while 11 cardiovascular variables were compared during the ensuing two hours. The variable included cardiac output, stroke volume, heart rate, mean arterial pressure, pulse pressure, central venous pressure, total peripheral resistance, pH, PaCO2, PaO2 and base deficit. Following the administration of the ether extract (40 mg/kg) the heart rate and the central venous pressure decreased significantly. The administration of ethanol extract (40 mg/kg) caused a significant decrease in the heart rate and the mean arterial pressure. After the administration of the aqueous extract (40 mg/kg) the cardiac output, stroke volume and central venous pressure were significantly decreased, while the total peripheral resistance was significantly increased.
