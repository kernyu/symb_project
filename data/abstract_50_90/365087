Swine were fed either a diet containing 110 mg of chlortetracycline (CTC) per kg (100 g/ton) or a control diet and were inoculated orally with Salmonella typhimurium that was either susceptible or resistant to CTC. The quantity, duration, and prevalence of fecal elimination of S. typhimurium, as well as the effect of CTC on the transmission of S. typhimurium from infected to uninfected swine, were determined. When animals were infected with CTC-resistant S. typhimurium, CTC increased the quantity (P < 0.05), duration (P < 0.05), and prevalence (P < 0.01) of fecal shedding, the transmission from infected to uninfected swine, and the recovery of the infecting organism at necropsy. When animals were infected with CTC-susceptible S. typhimurium, CTC reduced the quantity (between 7 and 10 days postinfection) (P < 0.01), duration (P < 0.05), and prevalence (P < 0.05) of fecal shedding, the transmission from infected to uninfected swine, and the recovery of the infecting organism at necropsy. Resistance to tetracycline was transferred in vivo to 4 and 6% of the susceptible infecting S. typhimurium recovered from the untreated and treated groups, respectively. The increased reservoir of S. typhimurium and the transfer of resistance to susceptible S. typhimurium have implications for both animal and public health.
