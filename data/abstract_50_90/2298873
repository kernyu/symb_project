The relationship between capsular polysaccharide types 5 and 8 and esterase electrophoretic types (zymotypes) in 160 French clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus was studied. Methicillin-susceptible strains of capsular types 5 and 8 were represented by 11 zymotypes, indicating a high polymorphism. Methicillin-resistant strains were mainly distributed in only two distinct populations. The predominant population was represented by strains of zymotype 6 and capsular type 5, and the second population was represented by strains of zymotype 14 and capsular type 8.
