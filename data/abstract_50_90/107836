The authors compared for routine use, the results obtained on 399 strains of Gram negative bacilli by two technics of antibiotic sensitivity: the technic of gel diffusion with imprenated discs and an automatic method (ABAC apparatus). Among the antibiotics used as a routine in our laboratory by the diffusion method and the 16 studied with the ABAC apparatus, 11 are common to both methods and were compared. The concordance of the results was greater than 90% for colistine (94.5%), oxolinic acid (93.5%), tobramycin (91.7%). It lies between 80 and 90% in the case of carbenicillin (89.1%), nalidixic acid (87.5%), kanamycin (87.2%). It is less in the case of gentamicin (77.9%), ampicillin (77.3%, chloramphenicol (76%), streptomycin (70.3%), minocycline with 55.9% gave the lowest results. The percentage of uninterpretable responses by ABAC was 0.7% for all 11 antibiotics. The correlations were good for the Enterobacteriaceae: Serratia (75.4%), Eschericia coli (87.5%). They are less in the case of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (71.6%). The ABAC makes sensitivity test automatic and appears a reliable method.
