High dose Cytarabin in relapsed and refractory acute leukaemia. High dose cytarabin can be very effective for the treatment of acute leukaemia resistent to conventional cytarabin doses. Therefore 10 patients (6 males, 4 females) with ages ranging from 18 to 58 years (median: 34 years) refractory to conventional induction therapy were treated with 1 hour infusions of high dose cytarabin (3 g/m2 q 12 h for 6 days) 2 patients got additional 20 mg/m2 doxorubicin on days 7 to 9. According to this treatment, in 5 of the 10 patients complete remissions could be achieved. Without further treatment 3 patients relapsed after 4, 7 and 15 months leading to death in 2 or 3 months. 19 months after treatment 1 patient is in complete remission, though demonstrating meningosis leukaemica 5 months after high dose cytarabin. Another patient relapsed 14 months after high dose cytarabin, reaching another complete remission after treatment according to a ALL/AUL protocol [7]. 2 patients died in bone marrow aplasia and 2 patients did not show any response, dying 11 months after high dose cytarabin application. All patients demonstrated vomiting, nausea, diarrhea and allopecia. Bone marrow was profoundly depressed in all patients with severe granulocytopenia and thrombocytopenia for periods from 7 to 34 days. 3 to 5 days after the end of high dose cytarabin therapy 3 patients developed acute ceratitis and 2 patients conjunctivitis. 3 patients showed erythrodermia of their skin with epidermolysis in 2 of these patients.
