We have found that the oxacillin-hydrolyzing penicillinase gene (oxa) encoded by plasmid RGN238 transposes to various plasmids in a recA background. We call this transposable element Tn2603. Tn2603 encodes the genes for streptomycin, sulfonamide, and mercury resistance in addition to the oxa gene. Tn2603 has a molecular size of 19.6 kilobase pairs and appears to be flanked by small inverted repeat sequences of about 200 base pairs long.
