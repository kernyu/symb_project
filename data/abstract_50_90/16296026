The antibiotic sensitivity patterns of 100 strains of S. pullorum and 24 strains of S. gallinarum against 19 antibiotics and 3 antibiotic mixtures were determined by the broth dilution method. The strains studied were isolated from enzootic outbreaks of pullorum disease and fowl typhoid. It was found that all the strains were sensitive to ampicillin, streptomycin, neomycin, kanamycin, oxytetracycline, chloromycetin, gentamycin, signamycin, polzomycin, and neotarchocin. Besides, S. pullorum was sensitive to aureomycin. In vitro studies showed that polzomycin and neotarchocin appeared to be the most effective drugs in the treatment of poultry diseases caused by S. pullorum or S. gallinarum. The appearance of high percentage of S. pullorum and S. gallinarum strains resistant simultaneously to several antibiotics points to the necessity of the determination of antibiotic sensitivity patterns of salmonellae isolated from birds.
