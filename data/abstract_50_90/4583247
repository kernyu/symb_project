Certain genetic, structural, and biochemical properties of a class 2 R-factor system consisting of the conjugally proficient transfer plasmid I and the naturally occurring non-conjugative tetracycline (Tc) resistance plasmid 219 are reported. I and 219 exist as separate plasmid deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) species in both Escherichia coli and Salmonella panama, having molecular weights of 42 x 10(6) and 5.8 x 10(6), respectively. The buoyant densities of I and 219 are 1.702 and 1.710 g/cm(3), respectively, in neutral cesium chloride. Although the Tc resistance plasmid is not transmissible in a normal conjugal mating, it is mobilized in a three-component mating by plasmid I and by certain other conjugative plasmids of the fi(+) or fi(-) phenotype. Mobilization does not appear to involve intermolecular recombination between plasmids, and no covalent linkage of resistance markers and fertility functions is observed. Transformation of CaCl(2)-treated E. coli by plasmid DNA is shown to be a useful procedure for studying the biological properties of different plasmid molecular species that have been fractionated in vitro, and for selectively inserting non-self-transmissible plasmids into specific bacterial strains. The effects of tetracycline on the rate of protein synthesis carried out by plasmid 219 were studied by using isolated E. coli minicells into which this plasmid had segregated. Consistent with the results of earlier investigations showing the inducibility of plasmid-mediated Tc resistance in E. coli, the antibiotic was observed to stimulate protein synthesis in minicells carrying the plasmid 219 and totally inhibit (3)H-leucine incorporation by minicells lacking the Tc resistance marker. Five discrete polypeptide species were synthesized by minicells carrying plasmid 219; exposure of minicells or parent bacteria to Tc resulted in specific and reproducible changes in polypeptide synthesis patterns.
