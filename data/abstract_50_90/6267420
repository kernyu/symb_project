A map of cleavage sites for restriction endonuclease EcoRI, BamHI, HindIII, and SalI on Tn2603, a transposon encoding resistance to ampicillin, streptomycin, sulfonamide, and mercury, was constructed by an analysis of restriction cleavage patterns of plasmid pMK1.::Tn2603 and its deletion derivative. By cloning the fragments generated from pMK1.::Tn2603 with these restriction endonucleases to a pACYC184 plasmid vehicle, the regions necessary for expression of resistance were located on the restriction cleavage map of Tn2603. Ampicillin, streptomycin, and sulfonamide-resistance genes were mapped in a cluster on the region between the center and the right and the mercury-resistance gene was located to the left of the map. The final functional map of Tn2603 was compared with those of Tn4 and Tn21 and the evolutional relationships between them were discussed.
