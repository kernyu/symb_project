Twenty patients who developed nosocomial Gram-negative bacteraemias in the medical or surgical intensive care units were treated with pefloxacin. All organisms were susceptible to pefloxacin and had not responded to previous antimicrobial therapy. The bacteraemias were eradicated in 16 of the 20 patients, all of whom tolerated the therapy without adverse effects.
