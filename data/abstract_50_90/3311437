Twenty three Plasmodium falciparum isolates collected from two highly pyrimethamine/sulfadoxine-resistant areas of Thailand were evaluated for their in vitro responses to pyrimethamine, sulfadoxine and combinations of these two drugs in various conditions. The test procedure was based on inhibition of parasite multiplication and of schizont formation, using the recommended modified RPMI medium 1640 with PABA 0.5 mug per litre and folic acid 10 mug per litre (LPLF). The optimum blood/medium ratios and inoculum sizes for parasite multiplication and for schizont formation were 1:19, 100 mul/well and 1:9, 50 mul/well, respectively. The appropriate incubation period was 48 hours. It was found that inhibition of either parasite multiplication or schizont formation could be used as the endpoint for evaluating the antiplasmodial action of pyrimethamine and combined pyrimethamine/sulfadoxine in vitro for field investigations; however, inhibition of only parasite multiplication should be used for determination of sulfadoxine activity. The actions of pyrimethamine in the combination pyrimethamine/sulfadoxine in ratios of 1:80 and 1:200 were similar. In vitro testing using combined pyrimethamine/sulfadoxine should be more precise than pyrimethamine alone for monitoring parasite susceptibility to the combined drug (Fansidar).
