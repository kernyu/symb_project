The currently used methods for assessing the therapeutic response to antimalarial drugs are relatively imprecise and insensitive. These methods are inadequate in severe malaria when the objectives of treatment are to save life and prevent complications. Very large studies are needed to demonstrate significant differences in mortality, but measurement of the rates of clinical, biochemical, and parasitological response may provide useful comparative information. Definitions, assessment criteria, procedures, and data collection forms should be standardized and evaluated prospectively. Antimalarial drug treatment in different clinical situations should be assessed in terms of the balance between the risks of drug toxicity and the benefits of the antimalarial drug action. This balance is considerably different in severe falciparum malaria compared with uncomplicated malaria infections.
