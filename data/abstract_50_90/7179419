Fourteen patients with active schistosomiasis mansoni in spite of previous treatment with oxamniquine and/or hycanthone were treated with praziquantel, single oral dose of 45 to 50 mg/kg body-weight. All underwent clinical, laboratory and electrocardiographic examination before and after treatment. Untoward effects (dizziness, drowziness, nausea and abdominal pain) were observed in ten. Laboratory findings disclosed no significant alteration and the electrocardiograms showed no abnormalities. Monthly follow-up examinations of 13 patients for six consecutive months showed parasitological cure in all. Before praziquantel treatment strains of Schistosoma mansoni were isolated from two patients, one treated three times with oxamniquine and the other with hycanthone once and oxamniquine twice. Progenies of these strains were maintained in Biomphalaria glabrata and mice. Groups of these infected mice were then treated with oxamniquine, hycanthone, niridazole and praziquantel and results compared with the BH strain maintained in our laboratory for many years. Schistosomicidal activity was assessed by the localization of worms in the portal vein system and oogram changes. Progenies from the strains isolated in this study were resistant to oxamniquine and hycanthone but sensitive to niridazole and praziquantel. The BH strain was sensitive to all four drugs. The serial runs of S. mansoni strains through intermediate and definitive hosts have not influenced their reactions to these schistosomicides.
