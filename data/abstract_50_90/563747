The results of study of the sorption properties of phenolformaldehide-activated coal in respect of several physiologically active substances from the physiological saline under static conditoins and under conditions of autohemoperfusion of the limb vessels in experimental animals are presented. Phenolformaldehide-activated coal proved to sorb actively serotonin, adrenaline and noradrenaline, and--to a lesser extent--histamine from physiological saline. Serotonin, adrenaline, noradrenaline, and acetylcholine are sorbed well, histamine--less, papaverine--very weakly from the flowing blood. No alteration of the systemic arterial blood pressure was noted with the inclusion of phenolformaldehide-activated coal into the animal's arterial circulation; a fall of perfusion pressure associated with the decreased vascular resistance occured in a number of cases.
