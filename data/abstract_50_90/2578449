Initiated spores and vegetative cells of the gramicidin S-producing Bacillus brevis Nagano were compared with respect to their resistance to various forms of stress (osmotic shock-starvation, exposure to ethanol, sonic oscillation, and heat). The resistance of initiated spores to all of these stress situations was considerably greater than that of vegetative cells and approached that of dormant spores. The period during which the initiated spores remained resistant to heat was extended by addition of gramicidin S. The antibiotic may therefore be of survival value to the species in nature by slowing down the development of initiated spores in the outgrowth phase of germination, thereby extending the period during which the cells are resistant to environmental stress.
