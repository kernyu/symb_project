The in vitro susceptibilities of 242 isolates of Serratia marcescens to 17 antibacterial drugs have been determined. Oxolinic acid, nalidixic acid, cefoxitin, and amikacin were the most active drugs. Ampicillin, kanamycin, and cephalothin were among the least active. A 4-year study showed that resistance of S. marcescens to dibekacin, tobramycin, sisomycin, and gentamicin has increased at least one order of magnitude in that period, whereas resistance to amikacin showed but a twofold increase.
