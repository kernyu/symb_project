Standardized broth microdilution and disk diffusion susceptibility tests for pefloxacin were performed on 585 clinical isolates. The 5-micrograms pefloxacin disk is recommended, and the following breakpoints are proposed: susceptible, greater than or equal to 19 mm (MIC, less than or equal to 2.0 micrograms/ml); resistant, less than or equal to 15 mm (MIC, greater than 4.0 micrograms/ml); and intermediate, 16 to 18 mm.
