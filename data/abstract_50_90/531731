The sensitivity of mouse cell lines in culture to the macrolide antibiotic, erythromycin stearate, was investigated. Both resistant and sensitive lines were found. Experiments indicated that in sensitive cells erythromycin stearate inhibits mitochondrial protein synthesis. Mutants resistant to erythromycin stearate were selected from the line LM(TK-), and these are also less sensitive to other macrolide antibiotics such as carbomycin and spiramycin. Attempts to transfer the erythromycin resistance of either the mutants or naturally resistant lines by fusion of cytoplasts with sensitive cells were unsuccessful, and it is concluded that resistance to erythromycin stearate is controlled by nuclear genetic factors.
