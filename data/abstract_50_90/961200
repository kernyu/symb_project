5 years patient-material: 336 cases (1042 case-sheats) were analysed for the purpose of studying the cases with relapse. 28 recurrence--7,62 per cent--were registered. Relapse is regarded, if the properly treated patient remained well for at least 5 years, without any signs and symptoms and after negative check-ups carried out at regular intervals became actively ill again. If active disease ocurred earlier this was not regarded a relapse but rather the progression of the original disease, which could be explained either by drug-resistance or insufficient conservative treatment.
