Porins are pore-forming outer-membrane proteins which serve as a non-specific pathway for the entry of hydrophilic molecules into Gram-negative bacteria. We studied four strains of Haemophilus influenzae that had decreased permeability to chloramphenicol associated with diminished quantities of a 40 kDa major outer-membrane protein. Isogenic pairs of organisms containing and lacking this protein were compared. The latter strains grew more slowly and were less permeable to sucrose and raffinose. They were also more resistant to multiple hydrophilic antibiotics than an isogenic strain containing the 40 kDa protein and were less permeable to penicillin G and chloramphenicol. We conclude that the 40 kDa outer-membrane protein functions as a porin in H. influenzae.
