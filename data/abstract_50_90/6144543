A mutant strain of Bacillus megaterium, arising spontaneously and resistant to micrococcin , possesses ribosomes which contain an altered form of protein BM-L11 (the homologue of Escherichia coli protein L11). Reconstitution analysis has revealed that the alteration to protein BM-L11 is the sole cause of resistance in this strain.
