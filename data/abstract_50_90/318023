Bacterial resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics, as indicated on sensitivity tests, is not always directly proportional to their beta-lactamase synthesis capacity. From the epidemiological viewpoint, therefore, it would appear important to look specifically for the various beta-lactamases in bacteria. Chemical and biological methods for this purpose are reviewed, with particular attention to those including special steps which render them speedy, economical and feasible in any laboratory. Practical examples are offered.
