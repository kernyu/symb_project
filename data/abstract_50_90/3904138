Postoperative urologic infection can result in morbidity and mortality. The diagnosis and management of postoperative bacterial urinary tract infections are discussed.

The wide spectrum of the third-generation cephalosporins affords them antimicrobial activity against common pathogens, and they share the low toxicity of other beta-lactam antibiotics.
