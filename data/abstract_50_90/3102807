Intravenous drip infusion of a new aminoglycoside agent, astromicin (ASTM), was used for various urological infections, and its clinical efficacy and safety were studied. Each of almost all the patients tested was given 200 mg of ASTM twice a day by intravenous drip infusion. Among 114 cases with complicated urinary tract infections (UTI) evaluated according to the criteria for evaluation of drug efficacy in UTI, clinical response was excellent in 16, moderate in 54 and poor in 44. The efficacy rate was 61.4%. Among 137 cases who were evaluated for side effects, headache was observed in 1 case (0.7%), which recovered spontaneously the day after the withdrawal of the drug. Slight elevation in S-GOT, S-GPT, Al-P and others was observed in 12 cases (8.8%) as abnormal laboratory test values.
