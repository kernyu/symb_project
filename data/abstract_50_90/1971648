The aim of this study was to determine whether ceftazidime is more effective than other antibiotics in the treatment of severe acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis, particularly when other antibiotics have previously failed. Our investigations showed that ceftazidime is effective and well tolerated in patients with severe chronic bronchitis and purulent sputum. The effectiveness of ceftazidime was seen in a reduction of the volume of sputum produced daily and in a colour change from yellow-green to clear-white. The absence of an effect on parameters of lung function was not unexpected since our patients had long-lasting chronic bronchitis.
