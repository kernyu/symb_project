Strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa exposed to subinhibitory concentrations of either polymyxin B, gentamicin, or carbenicillin were compared with untreated organisms for changes in sensitivity to pyocin. Pretreatment with polymyxin B or gentamicin resulted in a decreased sensitivity to pyocin, while carbenicllin pretreatment did not alter pyocin sensitivity.
