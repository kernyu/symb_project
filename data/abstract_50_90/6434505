The antibiotic susceptibility of 1866 consecutive non-replicate clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa from 24 British hospitals was examined. Antibiotics tested and resistance breakpoints selected were: carbenicillin (MIC greater than 128 mg/l), azlocillin (greater than 32 mg/l), cefotaxime (greater than 16 mg/l), cefoperazone (greater than 16 mg/l), ceftazidime (greater than 16 mg/l), amikacin (greater than 4 mg/l) and gentamicin (greater than 2 mg/l). Resistance frequencies detected were: carbenicillin 9.6%, azlocillin 3.9%, cefotaxime 19.0%, cefoperazone 4.3%, ceftazidime 0.3%, amikacin 3.8%, and gentamicin 5.5%.
