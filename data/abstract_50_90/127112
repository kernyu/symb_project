Among spontaneously occurring antibiotic-resistant mutants of Bacillus subtilis 168 we have identified a sub-class that is conditionally sporulative. Mutants in this sub-class are resistant to antibiotic during vegetative growth but are sensitive during sporulation. Mutants conditionally-resistant to erythromycin, kanamycin, spectinomycin, and streptomycin have been isolated and characterized by phase contrast microscopy and with respect to their ability to synthesize heat-resistant endospores or the sporulation-associated enzyme alkaline phosphatase. The results suggest that several entirely different genetic lesions may result in this single phenotype. This group includes mutants whose properties suggest that both th 30S and 50S ribosomal subunits may be altered concomitant with early spore specific metabolism. The blockage imposed by antibiotic may be at or near Stage 2 of sporulation.
