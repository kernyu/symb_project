Conjugal transfer of genetic material by Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis 11007 was examined. A plasmid of 88 MDa (pJS88) was identified in addition to the previously reported conjugally transferred plasmids of 32 (pKB32) and 4.8 MDa. Proteinase activity, reduced bacteriophage sensitivity, bacteriocin resistance, and conjugal transfer ability were encoded by pJS88. The ability to metabolize lactose (Lac+) was encoded by pKB32, and the 4.8-MDa plasmid was cryptic. When a strain containing both pKB32 and pJS88 was mated with a recipient deficient in host-mediated homologous recombination (Rec-), a plasmid of 40 MDa (pJS40) was observed in approximately 50% of the Lac+ transconjugants. DNA-DNA hybridization results indicated that pJS40 contained homology with both pKB32 and pJS88. These results indicated that pKB32 was conjugally transferred via conduction and suggested that pJS40 is a deletion derivative of a pKB32::pJS88 cointegrate. A Rec- strain containing pKB32 and pJS88 mediated Lac+ conjugal transfer, suggesting that the pKB32::pJS88 cointegrate could form via a rec-independent event. Resolution of the pKB32::pJS88 cointegrate was observed in both Rec- and Rec+ hosts. Cointegrate formation and resolution via rec-independent mechanisms suggest the involvement of a transposable element in the Tn3 family.
