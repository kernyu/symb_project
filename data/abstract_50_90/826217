The results of ampicillin use in therapy of 114 cases with fresh gonorrhea are presented. Males with acute and subacute urethritis and females with gonorrhea of the lower part of the genitourinary system were treated with ampicillin in the total dose of 2.5 gm according to the schedule: 1--0.5--0.5--0.5 gm every 6 hours. For the treatment of cases with torpid, prostatitis complicated, ascending gonorrhea combined with trichomonasis and in patients weighing more than 70 kg the course dose was increased up to 3.5--6 gm. Positive results were observed in 99.1 per cent of the cases. Relapses of the disease were registered in 0.9 per cent of the patients. Postgonorrhea changes were found in 16.7 per cent (7.5 per cent of the males and 38.1 per cent of the females). A definite conformity between sensitivity of gonococci to benzylpenicillin and ampicillin was shown, which should be taken into account in cases with increased resistance of gonococci to one of the drugs. Ampicillin is an effective antigonorrhea drug. Clearance of the focal exudates from gonococci was observed during the first 24 hours of the treatment.
