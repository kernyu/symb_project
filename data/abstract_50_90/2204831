Cytochrome P-450-dependent enzyme activities have been determined in malarial parasites. Both Plasmodium berghei and Plasmodium falciparum parasites exhibited activity and these activities were greater in chloroquine resistant parasites than in sensitive strains. This enzyme activity could be induced by phenobarbitone and inhibited by specific inhibitors of the cytochrome P-450 family of enzymes. The significance of these observations in parasite drug resistance is discussed.
