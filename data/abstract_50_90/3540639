The presence of plasmid pKM101 in Escherichia coli cells results in a slight increase in their sensitivity of lethal effect of formaldehyde. Plasmid ability to sensitize bacterial cells to formaldehyde inactivation is controlled by some chromosomal (uvrE, uvrA, recA) and plasmid-borne (mucAB) genes and depends on SOS-DNA repair activity. Plasmid pKM101 is capable of decreasing the level of repair reliability of DNA damaged by formaldehyde thus causing increased bacterial sensitivity to this agent.
