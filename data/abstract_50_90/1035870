Pretreatment of balb/c mice with ADK-1t cells adsorbed with Poly I:C DEAE- dx complex was found to enhance tumour growth as measured after challenge with non adsorbed ADK-1t cells. This results contrasts strongly with the increased tumour resistance previously observed when Poly I:C alone was used for adsorption. Some reasons are suggested for this striking difference.
