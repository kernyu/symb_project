Three of four N plasmids tested were found to be conjugatively transferable from Escherichia coli to Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The plasmids in the Pseudomonas transconjugants differed from the plasmids in the donor E. coli with respect to molecular weight, transfer ability, phenotype conferred, and stability. In some cases, the antibiotic and UV resistance genes appeared to integrate into the P. aeruginosa chromosome.
