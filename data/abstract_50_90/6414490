The addition of the Ca++ ionophore A23187 (10 microM) to the inside solution of the frog skin induced a transient increase in the active Na+ transport in frog skin (Rana esculenta) which decayed to the control values 60 minutes after the addition. At the same time the skin resistance failed significantly; antidiuretic hormone addition resulted in no-more increase of the Na+ active transport; the skin resistance remained unchanged. To further investigate the role of intracellular calcium on the skin transepithelial permeability, the effect of A23187 ionophore on thiourea permeability has been tested. Increase in intracellular Ca++ concentration brought about by calcium ionophores have been shown to modify both basal and ADH-stimulated thiourea transport.
