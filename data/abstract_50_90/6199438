The effects of intralesional chemotherapy with 7 different drugs on line 10 hepatoma grown in strain 2 guinea pigs were compared with the sensitivity of line 10 tumor cells in vitro, using a micro modification of the tumor stem assay with capillary tubes. A modified method was used to evaluate the in vitro dose-response curves. The correlation for in vivo/in vitro resistance was found to be 100% and for in vivo/in sensitivity it was 80%.
