Revertants of double opal-mutants of bacteriophage T4 have been obtained. The properties of these revertants suggest that reversion of double opal-mutants is effected by the activity of some gent-suppressor appeared in the phage genome. Restriction of these revertants by streptomycin-resistant bacterial strains shows that the suppression of the opal-mutants is realized at translation.
