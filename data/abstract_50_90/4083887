The coliform bacterial population in the Grand Forks, N.Dak. sewage system was examined for multiple-antibiotic-resistant organisms over a 1-year period. Multiple-antibiotic-resistant coliforms were found to be common in the sewage, and their numbers remained fairly constant relative to the total coliform population throughout the year. Resistance to kanamycin, tetracycline, and ampicillin was found to be transferable at variable rates. Transfer rates were found to be temperature sensitive and were optimal at 35 degrees C. Although 75% of the multiple-antibiotic-resistant coliforms were capable of transferring resistance at some level, only 25% were capable of transferring resistance at rates greater than 10(-3) transconjugants per initial donor.
