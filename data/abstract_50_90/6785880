In 1979 two patients with cavitary pulmonary tuberculosis were treated by a combination of three tuberculostatic drugs. During 12 1/2 and 16 1/2 weeks M. tuberculosis could be cultured in sputum and gastric juice respectively. Culturable M. tuberculosis are capable of infecting guinea-pigs and consequently are also infectious for humans.
