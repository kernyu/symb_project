The ability of strains of Bacteroides fragilis resistant to clindamycin and/or tetracycline to transfer resistance to a susceptible recipient strain in experimental subcutaneous abscesses in mice was investigated. The results indicated that such transfer took place at a frequency similar to that observed in vitro. Transfer of resistance determinants at infected sites may play a role in the epidemiology of disseminated resistance to antimicrobial agents.
