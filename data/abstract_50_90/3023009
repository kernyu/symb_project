Chloroquine was administered to 2-month hamsters inoculated at birth with an oncogenic virus SV-40 which was injected daily in a dose of 30 mg/kg for a month. Chloroquine-treated animals showed a statistically significant (6 weeks) shorter latent period of tumour development. The drug exerted no effect neither on the rate and incidence of transplantable E-1 test tumours or on the phenomenon of resistance in experiments on 4-6-month hamsters under its multiple administration in doses close to maximum tolerated ones (40 mg/kg).
