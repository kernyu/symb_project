Beta lactamase producing Neisseria gonorrhoea strains are only occasionally found in Curacao; of the non beta lactamase producing strains isolated from civilians a high percentage was moderately to highly resistant to penicillin and moderately resistant to tetracyclin. These percentages were even high in the case of gonococcal strains isolated from prostitutes. Strains which are resistant to spectinomycin were not found. These findings may warrant considering the use of alternative antibiotics in the treatment of gonococcal infections in this community.
