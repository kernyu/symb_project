Prediction of clinical response to induction treatment was studied in a group of 16 children and adolescents with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) by a colony inhibition assay. Samples from ten of 16 patients formed colonies in agar and cells were available from nine of these ten for further study. The system correctly predicted the response of eight of the nine patients (89%) with a confidence level of greater than 80% in all cases and thus produced useful results in half of the series of 16 children. The incorrect prediction occurred in a child whose leukemia had a very low plating efficiency and who relapsed soon after achieving remission. While this methodology requires further development and assessment, it shows great promise in aiding in the selection of appropriate chemotherapy for individual patients with AML.
