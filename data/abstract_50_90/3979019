High-level clindamycin resistance in Bacteroides species was investigated by measuring zone sizes surrounding 2 micrograms clindamycin and 60 micrograms erythromycin discs, using a nonstandardized disc diffusion method, and by determining minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC). The absence of a zone of inhibition surrounding either disc was predictive for all isolates having high-level resistance to both antibiotics (MIC greater than 256 micrograms/ml), characteristic of macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin (MLS) cross-resistance. Although zone size could not be used as an absolute predictor of MIC, a clindamycin zone diameter of less than 17 mm was suggestive of strains with a moderate level of clindamycin resistance (MIC greater than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml), regardless of erythromycin zone size. Disc diffusion testing using a combination of clindamycin and erythromycin discs can be a useful screening method for detection of clindamycin-resistant Bacteroides species, occurring either alone or as part of the MLS resistance phenotype.
