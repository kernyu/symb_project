The level of the antilysozyme activity of S. flexneri in ensuring the high level of their phage resistance has been studied. The realization of the phage protective effect of antilysozyme activity has been noted to occur due to disturbances in the lysis of infected bacteria by phage-synthetized lysozyme-like enzyme. The direct relationship between the level of the lysozyme production of bacteriophages and their capacity for overcoming the antilysozyme protection of the host bacterium has been shown.
