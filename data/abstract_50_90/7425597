The results of the studies on sensitivity of the intestine microflora to the antibiotics little adsorbed in the intestine are presented with respect to 8 patients with acute leukemia during and after decontamination. In addition to the cytostatic therapy, the patients were treated with gentamicin, ristomycin and nystatin administered orally in doses of 1200, 1500 mg and 6000000 units respectively every day for 2--4 weeks. The antibiotic sensitivity of the intestine microautoflora was determined before, during and after the antibiotic use, by the methods of gradient dishes and paper disks. It was found that during the use of nonadsorbing antibiotics the resistance of E. coli to gentamicin increased and only 3--4 weeks after discontinuation of the antibiotic use it regained the initial level. The shifts in sensitivity of staphylococcus to ristomycin and yeasts to nystatin were of the same character but less pronounced. Sensitivity of the intestine microautoflora to neomycin, monomycin, oxytetracycline and polymyxin decreased during decontamination and remained unchanged for 3--4 weeks after discontinuation of the antibiotic use. Some other characteristic features of the shifts in sensitivity of the intestine microflora to ristomycin, novobiocin and oxacillin were noted. Possible causes of such changes are discussed.
