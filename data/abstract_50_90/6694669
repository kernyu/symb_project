In order to understand why different stages of Trichinella spiralis vary in their susceptibility to killing by leukocytes, the effects of artificially generated oxidants on different stages of this parasite were compared. More than 90% newborn larvae were killed after incubation in acetaldehyde-xanthine oxidase or glucose-glucose oxidase. On the other hand, fewer than 10% of adult worms or muscle larvae were killed when incubated under identical conditions. Thus, only the stages which are resistant to killing by leukocytes are resistant to killing by oxidants. The larvicidal effect of acetaldehyde-xanthine oxidase was blocked by the addition of either superoxide dismutase or catalase and was partially inhibited by radical scavengers and singlet oxygen quenchers. The oxidant resistant adults and muscle larvae contained 3-5 times more superoxide dismutase and at least five times more glutathione peroxidase than the oxidant sensitive newborn larvae. In contrast, all 3 stages lacked detectable amounts of catalase and contained roughly equivalent amounts of reduced glutathione. Accordingly, adults and muscle larvae may be more resistant to killing by leukocytes than newborn larvae because they contain better oxidant defenses.
