Resistance to erythromycin is genetically unstable in strains of Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2). The frequent loss of resistance as well as reversion of sensitive variants to the original unstable resistance phenotype excluded the possibility that plasmid elimination is involved. The spontaneous frequency of occurrence of sensitive clones was 0.14 to 1.5%, the rate of reversion ranging from 1.10(-6) to 1.10(-8). Resistance to erythromycin has been mapped on the chromosomes of two S. coelicolor A3(2) derivatives in different sites: between markers adeC (v 10) and ArgA1 in the strain A617, between pheA1 and SCP1 in the strain S18. It is suggested that genetic instability of erythromycin resistance determinants having chromosomal location is due to transposition of genetic material.
