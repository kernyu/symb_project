Laboratory and clinical studies on clarithromycin (TE-031, A-56268), a new macrolide antibiotic, were carried out in the field of pediatrics. The results obtained are summarized as follows: 1. Serum concentrations, urinary concentrations and urinary recovery rates were determined upon oral administration on fasting of TE-031 at doses of 5 mg/kg granules in 1 case and tablets in 2 cases, and 10 mg/kg granules in 1 and 15 mg/kg granules in 1. Peak serum levels were obtained at 30 minutes in 2 cases, at 1 hour in 2 cases and at 2 hours in 1 case after administration of the drug with a range of 2.29-7.10 micrograms/ml with half-lives of 2.2-7.5 hours. Urinary recovery rates in 6 hours after administration ranged from 7.1-34.5%. 2. MICs of TE-031 against 49 clinical isolates (Streptococcus pyogenes 5 strains, Streptococcus pneumoniae 9, Staphylococcus aureus 3, Branhamella catarrhalis 4, Haemophilus influenzae 14, Haemophilus parainfluenzae 7, and Campylobacter jejuni 7) were compared with those of josamycin (JM), erythromycin (EM), and ampicillin (ABPC). The antibacterial activity of TE-031 was superior to those of JM and equal to those of EM. 3. Fifty-five pediatric patients with acute infectious diseases (scarlet fever 3 cases, pharyngitis and tonsillitis 15, pertussis 2, pneumonia 10, bronchitis 14, Campylobacter enteritis 11) were treated with TE-031 at daily doses of 10-35 mg/kg t.i.d. as a rule. The efficacy rates were 96% clinically and 72% bacteriologically. 4. Side effects or abnormal laboratory test values were not observed. 5. None of children refused TE-031.
