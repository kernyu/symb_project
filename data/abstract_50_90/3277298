The availability of beta-lactam antibiotics with extended spectra of activity against organisms commonly seen in surgical infections suggests that aminoglycoside-based therapy is no longer needed for most such community-acquired infections. The primary problems with specific beta-lactams are lack of activity against Bacteroides species and variable activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococci. The pharmacokinetic properties of the newer beta-lactams vary considerably. This variation suggests specific settings in which these properties may be taken advantage of to improve clinical outcome.
