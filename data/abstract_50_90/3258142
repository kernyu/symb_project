We determined the susceptibilities of five strains of Trichomonas vaginalis, one of which was metronidazole resistant, to 50 antimicrobial agents. For the metronidazole-susceptible strains, the most active agents were metronidazole, tinidazole, mebendazole, furazolidone, and anisomycin. Against the resistant strain mebendazole, furazolidone, and anisomycin were the most active. Antifungal agents, beta-lactams, macrolides, aminoglycosides, and folic acid antagonists were ineffective against all strains.
