Five recombinant plasmids, pBK2646, pBK611, pRC3, pRC4 and pRC5, carrying rpoB rifampicin-resistant RNA-polymerase genes were obtained. The sequence analysis of these plasmids revealed certain structural changes in the rpoB gene which specify corresponding alterations in the beta-subunit of RNA polymerase. Some functional properties of the corresponding mutant strains and their RNA polymerases have been investigated.
