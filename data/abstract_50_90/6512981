Forty-three children and 4 adults with Campylobacter enteritis were studied in the treatment of fosfomycin (FOM). FOM was administered per orally in doses ranging from 50 to 100 mg/kg/day for children and 3 g/day for adults for 5 days. Main symptoms such as diarrhea and fever were disappeared within 2 days on the average. Campylobacter jejuni in stool specimen disappeared within a week in 95% of these patients. The duration of main symptoms and the period of positive stool culture were evidently shortened in FOM-treated group compared with non-treated group. All of the isolated strains were sensitive to FOM by mono-concentration disk method. MIC50 of these strains remained between 1.56 and 3.13 micrograms/ml. None of these MIC was beyond 12.5 micrograms/ml.
