Accumulation of purified adenylylated dihydrostreptomycin (DHS-AMP) was examined in two strains of Escherichia coli. E. coli JSRO-N was plasmid free and aminoglycoside (AG) susceptible; E. coli JSRO-N(pSAD1) contained a plasmid-encoded AG adenylyltransferase which modifies DHS and streptomycin and confers resistance to both of these drugs. Although both whole cells and spheroplasts of JSRO-N accumulated free DHS, we were not able to demonstrate uptake of DHS-AMP by this strain. Whole cells and spheroplasts of JSRO-N(pSAD1) accumulated DHS at a much slower rate than that observed in JSRO-N. This was presumably due to the activity of the adenylyltransferase in JSRO-N(pSAD1). However, this low rate of accumulation of DHS was still higher than the uptake of DHS-AMP by either JSRO-N or JSRO-N(pSAD1). Thus, the rate of accumulation of DHS-AMP was even lower than that of DHS during the slow, initial, energy-dependent phase of AG uptake seen in JSRO-N(pSAD1). We also found that when either JSRO-N or JSRO-N(pSAD1) was incubated with barely inhibitory or subinhibitory concentrations of DHS, rapid uptake of DHS could be stimulated by the addition of an inhibitory concentration of another AG, such as amikacin. Uptake of DHS-AMP could not be similarly enhanced by the addition of amikacin. Our results indicate that DHS-AMP is not accumulated by whole cells or spheroplasts of E. coli. These results are consistent with the postulated intracellular location of AG-modifying enzymes.
