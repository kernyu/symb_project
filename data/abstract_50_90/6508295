Strains of Aeromonas hydrophila isolated from skin infections of common freshwater fish in Bangladesh were tested for enterotoxin production, hemolysin production, and any correlation between these two activities. We also tested the resistance patterns of A. hydrophila to different drugs, especially in relation to ampicillin. The A. hydrophila strains produced an enterotoxin that was related to their beta-hemolytic activities. Production of beta-hemolysin may thus be an indicator of enterotoxicity. As 50% of the strains of A. hydrophila were found to be susceptible to 12.5 micrograms of ampicillin per ml, media containing this antibiotic may not be suitable for their isolation.
