A total of 92 Salmonella strains, isolated from birds, were studied through graded dilutions in a solid nutrient medium for their resistance to penicillin, streptomycin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, furazolidon and norsulfazol. Greatest was the number of strains resistant to penicillin (81.5 per cent), and lowest was it of strains resistant to tetracycline (27.1 per cent), norsulfazol (21.7 per cent), streptomycin (15.2 per cent), and furazolidon (1.08 per cent). No resistant strains were found to chloramphenicol. Both furazolidon and chloramphenicol are suggested for the control of Salmonella infections in birds.
