Adult DBA/2 mice were given injections s.c. with either interferon-sensitive (745) or -resistant (3Cl-8) Friend erythroleukemia cells (FLC). After tumor nodules had developed, mouse interferon-alpha/beta was injected daily into the tumor. 31P-Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy examinations were undertaken on freshly dissected tumors at different days of treatment with either interferon or control preparations. Analysis of 745 FLC tumors in untreated mice at different days of tumor growth (day 8 to 13 after tumor implantation) showed marked increases in the levels of phosphorylcholine (PCho), glycerophosphorylethanolamine (GroPEtn) and glycerophosphorylcholine (GroPCho). In contrast high levels of PCho, GroPEtn and GroPCho were already detectable in the 3Cl-8 FLC tumors on day 8, and no significant changes were observed during subsequent tumor growth. The intracellular pH value remained practically constant in both FLC tumors. Daily intratumoral administration of either partially purified (10(7) IU/mg of protein) or highly purified (10(9) IU/mg of protein) mouse interferon-alpha/beta to both cell tumors resulted in decreases in the levels of PCho, GroPEtn and GroPCho and in increases in the intracellular pH with respect to tumors treated with control preparations or left untreated. Two days of daily treatment of mice with interferon sufficed to induce these metabolic changes which preceded the appearance of necrosis in the tumors. Treatment of FLC tumors with X-rays on day 12 of tumor growth did not result in any comparable metabolic changes 2 days after irradiation. Changes in the levels of phospholipid metabolites were not observed when 745 or 3Cl-8 cells were cultivated in the presence of interferon. As interferon induced these changes in both interferon-sensitive and -resistant tumors we conclude that interferon treatment results in host-mediated effects on the biosynthesis and/or catabolism of tumor cell phospholipids.
