Because malaria remains a major worldwide public health problem, and resistance to currently available drugs is becoming more prevalent, interest has focused on the clinical pharmacology of antimalarials.

This article therefore reviews the current information on the pharmacology of the commoner drugs, and describes possible future tools to combat malaria.
