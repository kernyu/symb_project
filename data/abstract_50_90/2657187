Human milk has the unique capability to originate and maintain a predominance of bifidobacteria in the large bowel of infants. There is evidence, that besides other protective factors this special microbiologic effect may have beneficial influences on the resistance against enteral infections as well as on a symbiotic utilization of some milk components. This is the reason, why there have been many attempts in past to imitate the bifidogenic effect in infant formulas. The different theories formed for the classification of this principle focus on either the low buffer capacity of mother's milk, the mutarotation of lactose and the existence of antimicrobial and bifidus growth factors, respectively. The bifidogenic principle is, however, in all probability not related to only one of these factors. It can rather be considered a complex of interacting factors, of which rapid gastric emptying due to the relatively high concentration of free amino acids and peptides, missing bacterial colonization of the small bowel, absence of antigenic effects of the food protein and low enterocyte regeneration may play an additional role. These aspects can be looked upon as a challenge for further research on mother's milk composition and on the metabolic effects of its constituents in future.
