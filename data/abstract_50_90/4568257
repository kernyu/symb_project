The lipid content of antibiotic-resistant, nonpigmented strain (Bizio) and antibiotic-sensitive, pigmented strain (08) of Serratia marcescens was studied. The resistant strain contains at least three times more total extractable lipid and phospholipid than the sensitive strain. Lysophosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine, lecithin, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, and polyglycerolphosphatide were identified in the phospholipid fractions of both strains.
