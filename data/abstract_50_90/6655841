Clinical studies of cefpiramide (CPM), a newly developed cephem antibiotic, were performed in 10 children with respiratory tract infection in 4 cases, acute enteritis in 2 cases and urinary tract infection in 4 cases aged from 2 months to 10 years and 4 months. CPM was intravenously given to patients at doses of 16 approximately 58 mg/kg/day divided into 3 times for 3 approximately 22 days. Clinical effects were excellent in 6, good in 3 and fair in 1. Bacteriologically, 3 strains of pathogenic organisms (Salmonella C2 group, E. coli and S. faecalis) isolated from the patients were eradicated with the treatment of CPM. No side effect was observed.
