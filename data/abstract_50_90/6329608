118 strains of Clostridium perfringens isolated from human fecal specimens were examined for sensitivity to tetracycline. Minimum inhibitory concentrations of tetracycline were more than 50 micrograms/ml for 18 strains and less than 3.1 micrograms/ml for 54 strains. Tetracycline resistance transfer experiments were carried out using 18 tetracycline-resistant strains as donors and 54 drug-sensitive strains as recipients. 14 of 18 tetracycline-resistant strains transferred their resistance to at least 1 recipient, and 48 of 54 tetracycline-sensitive strains accepted tetracycline resistance from at least 1 donor strain.
