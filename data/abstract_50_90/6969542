A rapid method utilizing Kirby-Bauer susceptibility plates was developed to determine bacterial tolerance to antibiotic bactericidal activity. After completion of initial antibiotic disk susceptibility testing, the disks containing cephalothin, cefazolin, nafcillin, oxacillin, and methicillin were removed and replaced with disks containing a potent beta-lactamase. The plates were reincubated for 18-24 hours and examined for regrowth of organisms within the original zone of inhibition. For 15 of 16 patients who had serious Staphylococcus aureus infections, the method correlated with clinical outcome of antibiotic chemotherapy. Broth dilution tests for bactericidal activity only correlated with clinical response for 11 of 16 patients. One hundred consecutive clinical S. aureus isolates tested with the new method demonstrated tolerance in 27% of strains to cephalothin, 15% to cefazolin, 1% to oxacillin, and 2% of nafcillin.
