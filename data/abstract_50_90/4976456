The content of drug-resistant coliform bacteria in faecal specimens collected before admission from patients awaiting non-urgent surgery were compared with specimens collected in hospital. Resistant strains of Escherichia coli were isolated from 52% of preadmission specimens and were present in large numbers in 28%. Tetracycline, sulphonamide, and streptomycin resistance were commonest: 60% of resistant strains carried transmissible R factors and multiple resistance was commoner than single. No characteristically resistant intestinal bacteria of any genera were found in hospital specimens as compared with those from outside.
