Eight Serratia marcescens strains tested could be transformed with the plasmid pBR322. Transformants were selected on the basis of resistance to high levels of ampicillin (400 to 500 micrograms/ml). For six of the strains, the CaCl2- mediated transformation procedure developed for Escherichia coli was successful. For the other two strains, no transformants were obtained with the CaCl2-mediated transformation procedure unless the cells first received a heat treatment. Transformation frequency was dependent on DNA concentration, and no transformation was detected with linear pBR322 DNA. The stability and copy number of pBR322 were similar in S. marcescens and E. coli. As in E. coli, the pBR322 DNA was amplified in S. marcescens after inhibition of proteins synthesis. Based on these results, cloning in S. marcescens should be possible and pBR322 should be a useful cloning vehicle.
