Thirty-five infants of low socioeconomic status who were living in urban Santiago were hospitalized for acute diarrhea were prospectively evaluated for the presence of enteropathogens associated with the episode. Some degree of malnutrition was evident in 20 infants (57.1%); 15 of these (75%) were under 6 months of age. Mean duration of the hospital stay was 11.8 days for well-nourished patients and 15.7 days for the malnourished patients. One or more enteropathogens were found in 60% of the cases studied: in 17 cases (48.6%) these were bacteria and in four cases (11.4%) it was rotavirus. Parasites were not detected. In three patients, two different pathogens were demonstrated. Among the bacteria, 12 isolates (34.3%) were enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) and two (5.7%) were Shigella. Campylobacter jejuni was also isolated from two different cases (5.7%) and Salmonella from one case (2.9%). The recovery of pathogens was independent of the nutritional status. Mean age of detection of EPEC was 3.2 months among well-nourished infants and 6.2 months among the malnourished (p less than 0.001). Half of the EPEC strains isolated were multiresistant to antibiotics. One of these strains transferred some of its resistance in vitro to E. coli K12. Ampicillin and kanamycin were the antibiotics to which EPEC showed the greatest resistance. The other bacterial pathogens were mostly sensitive to antibiotics. Campylobacter jejuni, together with Shigella, was the second most frequent pathogen isolated during episodes of diarrhea. Campylobacter should be included in the routine study of diarrheal episodes in our setting.
