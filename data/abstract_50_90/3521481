Ureaplasma urealyticum is an organism considered susceptible to tetracycline. Ten tetracycline-resistant (Tcr) clinical isolates and Tcr serotype 9 were examined. All contained DNA sequences homologous to the streptococcal determinant tetM. They differed from each other on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, Southern blots, and immunoblots and appeared to represent different strains.
