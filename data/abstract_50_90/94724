The effect of DDT and gamma-HCH in concentrations of 100, 50, and 10 micrograms on the biological properties of staphylococci was studied. Both substances proved to be inhibitory to coagulation of rabbit plasma and to penicillinase production, causing depigmentation of the colonies. The morphological structure of cells is affected by these substances as well. The growth of the strain is not substantially influenced. Gas chromatography proved that staphylococci do not participate in the DDT and gamma-HCH degradation in the medium.
