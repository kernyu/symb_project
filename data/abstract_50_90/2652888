Presented here are the ideas and the experimental results which led us to this scheme for the chemotherapy of severe bacterial infections. The approach is twofold, administering mainly two chemotherapeutics not concomitantly but alternating every four hours by means of a short-time i.v. infusion. Furthermore, immediately after admittance and even before the outbreak of an infection the patients' bacterial spectrum of wounds, the pharynx or the urine is monitored by carrying out bacteriological tests. These prophylactic diagnostics allow the identification of a dangerous proliferation of germs even before the outbreak of a florid infection. Therefore, an early chemotherapy can be put into practice considering the available evaluations of resistance studies.
