It was shown morphologically and microbiologically that cephalexin administered intragastrically in a dose of 2 g/kg induced deep microecological changes in the cecum of Wistar albino rats. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that a single use of cephalexin in the above dose resulted in almost complete elimination of the biofilm from the surface of the cecum mucosa and it inflammation. This was accompanied by an increase in the number of potentially pathogenic bacteria and broadening of the spectrum of the phage variants of coliform bacilli present in the animal feces, as well as by change the periods of coliform bacilli persisting in the large intestine.
