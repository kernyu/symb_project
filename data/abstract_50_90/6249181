Cyclophosphamide (CY) increased whereas the talc embedded in a calcium phosphate gel (TCP) decreased the susceptibility of mice to systemic candidiasis estimated by measuring mean survival time and "renal infectivity" 12 h after challenge. Transfers of plasma from CY- and TCP-treated mice did not modify cnadidiasis susceptibility of recipient mice. Granulopenia and granulocytosis induced respectively by CY and TCP were significantly correlated with susceptibility or resistance to candidiasis. Nevertheless, TCP produced significant reticuloendothelial stimulation which could be also correlated with TCP protection. Reticuloendothelial stimulation with associated granulopenia in TCP-CY-treated mice gave protection against Listeria monocytogenes challenge but not against Candida albicans. Thus, blood polymorphonuclear leukocytes seem to play the main role in natural resistance of mice to candidiasis. This was corroborated after injection of immunostimulants; a good correlation was found between C. albicans resistance and the induced granulocytosis.
