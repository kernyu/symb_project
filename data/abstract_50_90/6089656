Transposon Tn7 codes for resistance to trimethoprim and streptomycin. For detection of Tn7 by DNA-DNA hybridization, two recombinant plasmids were constructed. The former contained a 1-kilobase BamHI fragment and the latter contained a 4.3-kilobase EcoRI-BamHI fragment of Tn7. These DNA fragments, which did not include the drug resistance genes, were used as probes for detecting Tn7-like sequences in bacterial strains by colony hybridization. They hybridized strongly to bacterial DNA known to carry Tn7 but not to DNA known to carry transposons other than Tn7. These probes were used to study the occurrence of Tn7 in bacterial strains isolated in the Turku City Hospital in Finland. Transposon Tn7 was present in 47.2% of 199 trimethoprim-resistant enterobacteria (MIC greater than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml). Among the 69 Proteus mirabilis strains studied, 75% contained Tn7, although none of these strains transferred trimethoprim resistance in conjugation tests. The reliability of colony hybridization was further confirmed by Southern hybridization to detect the Tn7-specific 2.6-kilobase HindIII restriction fragment. Colony hybridization proved to be a sensitive and rapid method for detecting Tn7-determined sequences.
