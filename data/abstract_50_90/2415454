Intraperitoneally injected rRNA from Pseudomonas aeruginosa combined with dimethyldioctadecylammonium bromide (DDA) increased nonspecifically the resistance of mice against an intraperitoneal challenge with extracellular (P. aeruginosa, Escherichia coli) and intracellular (Listeria monocytogenes) bacteria. This study concerns the mechanism underlying the nonspecific resistance. RNA with DDA (RNA-DDA) induced a cell influx and activated peritoneal macrophages (M phi) as judged by the decreased 5'-nucleotidase and alkaline phosphodiesterase activities in M phi lysates, the enhanced O2- release, and the increased antitumor activity in comparison with unstimulated M phi. RNA without DDA did not enhance the resistance and did not influence the peritoneal cell numbers or M phi properties. DDA without RNA enhanced the resistance of mice only slightly; it induced a cell influx, yielding elicited M phi as judged by the decreased 5'-nucleotidase activity and increased alkaline phosphodiesterase activity, the slightly enhanced O2- release, and the absence of increased antitumor activity. Both RNA-DDA and DDA M phi showed an enhanced capacity to ingest and kill L. monocytogenes in vitro, DDA M phi being slightly less effective than RNA-DDA M phi with respect to killing. We conclude that the enhanced killing capacity of M phi for L. monocytogenes is characteristic of both elicited DDA M phi and activated RNA-DDA M phi. The relationship between nonspecific resistance, peritoneal cell numbers, and antibacterial M phi activity is discussed. In addition, it is shown that RNA and DDA retain their activity when they are injected apart, suggesting that they activate M phi by sequential action.
