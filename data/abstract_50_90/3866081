This paper deals with fundamental and clinical results, in the field of pediatrics, of the newly developed rectal suppository (CZX-S) of a cephem antibiotic ceftizoxime (CZX). CZX-S was well absorbed in children. The mean peak serum concentrations of CZX in the 125 mg-administered group (average: 9.9 mg/kg) and the 250 mg-administered group (average: 13.4 mg/kg) were 5.10-7.71 micrograms/ml at 15-30 minutes after dosing. Serum concentrations of CZX were measurable level in almost all the children at 6 hours after administration with the half-lives were 1.34-1.55 hours. The 6-hour urinary excretion rate accounted for 16.5-22.0%. CZX-S was administered to 30 children with acute upper or lower respiratory tract infections about 20-60 mg/kg/day in 3-4 divided portions. CZX-S provided favorable therapeutic-effect in most of the children 3-5 days after administration. The effectiveness rate was 93%. The causative organisms of H. influenzae (3 cases) and S. aureus (4 cases) isolated clinically from pharyngeal mucous and sputum were eradicated after administration of CZX-S. Anal pain and diarrhea experienced in 5 of the 30 children and CZX-S was withdrawn in 4 (of the 5) children, but exhibited satisfactory therapeutic-effect in 2 of the 4 cases up to withdrawal of the drug. An increase in GOT and GPT was observed in 3 cases. The values returned to the normal range in 1 case after the treatment with CZX-S. The test was not reexamined in the other 2 cases. The present clinical result suggests the usefulness of CZX-S substituted for oral and injectable forms in the treatment of various pediatric infections caused by organisms sensitive to CZX.
