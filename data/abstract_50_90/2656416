When studying antibioticograms of 1303 strains of pathogenic Escherichia, the correlation of their resistance with the character and source of emanation, exciters' serogroups and antibiotics has been established. The strains isolated from the environment, primarily from food-staffs, wash-out, and wastewater have higher antibiotic resistance. No significant differences are noted in the number of resistance markers as to the source of pathogenic Escherichia. The following antibiotic range is established: streptomycin-chloramphenicol (chloromycetin)--neomycin sulfate-tetracyline-kanamycin-polymyxin-gentamycin, thus the least number of strains in characterized by gentamycin resistance.
