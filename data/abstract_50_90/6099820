The in vitro activity of Cefotiam (Spizef) was tested using the agar diffusion test method according to DIN 58940 and compared with the antibacterial activity of 12 other routinely tested antibacterial chemotherapeutics. A total of 3000 strains from patients' specimens from the University Hospital of the Free University of Berlin and the Municipal Wenckebach Hospital, West Berlin, was tested. Cefotiam proved effective against strains of Staphylococcus aureus in 99,4%, Escherichia coli in 99,7%, Klebsiella species in 97,8%, Enterobacter species in 90,3%, Proteus mirabilis in 98,7%, indolpositive Proteus species in 91,7%, Citrobacter in 92,6%, and beta-hemolytic Streptococci in 99,3% of all strains tested. There were only few sensitive strains of Enterococci and of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
