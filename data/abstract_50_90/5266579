Reasons for the accumulation of mercury-resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus in hospital have been studied. A collection of paired strains, that is staphylococci similar in every respect except sensitivity to mercury salts, was made. Tests were made in an attempt to demonstrate a link between mercury resistance and some other factor which might aid survival, viz. resistance to drying and heat, production of bound coagulase, growth in the presence of sublethal amounts of tetracycline, survival in human blood at 37 degrees C. and uptake by polymorphs at 30 degrees C. and 37 degrees C., development of resistance to antibiotics and competition in mixed cultures. It was not possible to demonstrate any consistent link between mercury resistance and any of these properties. Paper strips impregnated with the mercurial diuretic, Mersalyl, were shown to differentiate between mercury-resistant and -sensitive strains in vitro. Furthermore, development of resistance to mercury by passage in mercuric chloride-broth was demonstrated.It is proposed that mercury resistance has developed as a result of exposure to the mercury ion. Mercurial diuretics have been frequently used in medical and geriatric patients and it is among these that the higher carrier rates of mercury-resistant strains are found even when the local endemic strain is disregarded. In obstetric patients, where mercurials are seldom used, mercury-resistant strains are rare.Nasal carriage of factory workers exposed to mercury products showed that this group is likely to carry resistant or partially resistant strains.
