Extensive studies have shown that chemical carcinogenesis involves an initiation-promotion pattern. A gene amplification model of carcinogenesis predicts that initiation involves induction of a genetic tandem duplication. We use a system developed by Anderson and Roth to select for tandem duplication of the histidine operon of Salmonella typhimurium by selection for resistance to 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole. Evidence reported here shows that, consistent with prediction, 10 carcinogens are all active in inducing tandem duplications. Two toxic noncarcinogens show little or no activity under the conditions used in inducing tandem duplication but azide, a mutagenic noncarcinogen, did show some activity. 9 types of evidence now support the gene amplification initiation-promotion model of carcinogenesis.
