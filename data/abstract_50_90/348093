A multiply drug-resistant strain of Proteus mirabilis was isolated from 14 patients on a surgical service. Antimicrobial susceptibility studies demonstrated that the organism was highly resistant to numerous antibiotics, including gentamicin, tobramycin, and sisomicin. The organism was susceptible in vitro to amikacin but had low-level resistance to netilmicin. In vitro susceptibility studies with combinations of cephalothin with netilmicin and trimethoprim with sulfamethoxazole showed these drugs to be synergistic. Other drug combinations failed to act synergistically.
