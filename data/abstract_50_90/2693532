An attempt has been made to study the dynamics in the epidemiology of a locality where the local strains of Plasmodium falciparum have developed resistance to the antimalarial chloroquine. Increase in the transmission rate and prolonged drug pressure with chloroquine have been noted in association with the development of resistance. The importance of the study is on the mean parasite clearance time and mean parasite recrudescence time which appear to be related with the process developing resistance of chloroquine.
