All Basidiomycotina screened were sensitive to validamycin A, whereas most Ascomycotina and all Mucorales and Oomycetes were insensitive. Studies with Rhizoctonia cerealis and Fusarium culmorum showed that, in semi-solid culture, the antibiotic caused a decrease in colony radial growth rate and that this was associated with a decrease in mean hyphal extension rate and an increase in hyphal branching. However, the antibiotic did not alter the morphology of R. cerealis grown in liquid culture (shaken or stationary). Validamycin A caused a reduction in the number and viability of conidia produced by F. culmorum.
