The author experienced two model cases of long-lasting SPCN (smear positive and culture negative) status. The both cases having no prior chemotherapy, which were suggestive of relationship of SPCN to the use of RFP and the presence of huge cavity wherein tuberculous bacilli were most abundant. In these two cases, the laboratory examination showed resistance of the bacillus against INH which was most effective in tuberculous chemotherapy and the bacillus were sensitive against RFP. The SPCN continued for more than half a year. The both cases had huge cavity in the lung. The culture of bacillus was continued for 16 weeks, and no growth of colony was observed. Moreover, in one case, RFP was prescribed 1.2 g/day, much higher than the ordinary dose. The case was a medical doctor, and this dose was prescribed according to his wish. As mentioned above, these two SPCN cases were very suggestive of the model of explaining mechanisms of SPCN with simultaneous presence of huge cavity, resistance against INH and sensitivity to RFP.
