NY-198 [1-ethyl-6,8-difluoro-1,4-dihydro-7-(3-methyl-1-piperazinyl)-4-oxo-3- quinolinecarboxylic acid hydrochloride] is a new difluorinated quinolone characterized by the presence of a C-methyl group at the 3 position of the piperazine moiety. It has a broad antibacterial spectrum. The in vitro antibacterial activity of NY-198 was almost the same as those of ofloxacin and norfloxacin, but far exceeded that of pipemidic acid. NY-198 was more active than norfloxacin against Pseudomonas maltophilia, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, and anaerobic microorganisms. Cross resistance was not observed between NY-198 and various antibiotics including methicillin, gentamicin, and ampicillin. NY-198 had bactericidal activity at the MIC or slightly higher than the MIC. It showed excellent antibacterial activity against various systemic infections in mice. After oral administration, NY-198 was two times more active than or as active as ofloxacin and two to four times more active than norfloxacin.
