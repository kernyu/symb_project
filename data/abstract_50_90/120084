The successful treatment of bacterial endocarditis requires a close cooperation to a clinical microbiological laboratory. This performs blood cultures, estimation of sensitivity to the different antibiotics, if anyhow possible also quantitatively, and supervision of therapy by serum bactericidal tests. Synergistic combinations by adding one of the aminoglycosides bring the best chances for therapeutic success. Special advices are given in dependence of the numerous causative bacterial agents. Rare ones are sufficiently taken into consideration. If blood cultures remain negative, empiricial chemotherapy is recommended. Surgical treatment by operative replacement of the infected heart valves and insertion of prosthetic ones is indicated in uncontrolled infection, in severe heart failure caused by valve perforation, and in recurrent embolism. Early interventions have a much better prognosis. Special problems are connected to bacterial endocarditis in prosthetic valves. Bacterial endocarditis in drug addicts is of relatively good prognosis in spite of the frequent complications. Patients with suspicious or evident bacterial endocarditis should be transferred to centers owing sufficient diagnostic and therapeutic experiences.
