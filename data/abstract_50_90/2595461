Over the period from January 1985 to July 1986 2038 samples of the patients with open wounds and burns, treated in the Military Medical Academy in Belgrade, were tested. Acinetobacter calcoaceticus was found in 152 samples (7.45%). The sensitivity to standard hemotherapeutics for Gram-negative bacteria was assessed. Results indicated that Acinetobacter calcoaceticus showed a high resistance to all hemotherapeutics used in this investigation. Even if it was a opportunistic pathogen bacterium its clinical importance was great because in some conditions this bacterium could cause long-lasting and hard infectious treatment.
