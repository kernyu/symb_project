Neurons of dorsal root ganglia and of superior cervical ganglia did not display any morphological signs of degeneration when kainic acid (KA) was administered either systemically (20 and 40 mg/kg) or when it was directly injected (1 microgram). The KA doses used were sufficient to result in heavy destruction of hippocampal CA3/CA4 neurons and neurodegeneration of various brain regions after intracerebroventricular or local application, respectively. The resistance of the peripheral neurons to KA is discussed as a consequence of lacking glutamate inputs.
