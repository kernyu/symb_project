The buoyant density of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) from the temperature-sensitive R factor, Rts1, was determined by CsCl density-gradient centrifugation. Rts1 was found to consist of a single species of DNA of density 1.705 g/cm(3), which corresponds to a base composition of 45% guanine plus cytosine. This value is distinct from the densities previously reported for other R factors, suggesting that Rts1 represents a new molecular class of R factors.
