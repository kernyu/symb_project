The investigation was focused on 60 strains of Gr- microorganisms isolated from urocultures and resistant to gentamicin and/or amikacin. Resistance evaluation by the method of Bauer--Kirby with respect to 7 aminoglycoside aminocyclitols (streptomycin, spectinomycin, kanamycin, gentamicin, tobramycin, sisomicin, netilmicin and amikacin) as well as determination of minimal inhibitory concentrations revealed that the most frequently occurring resistance phenotype was streptomycin kanamycin gentamicin sisomicin tobramycin (91.66% tested microorganisms). Approximately 50% of all tested organisms were found to be susceptible to netilmicin. Assays for aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes using 32P ATP and 14C ATP confirmed APH(3')(5")--I and AAD(2") as resistance determinants regarding 4,6-substituted deoxystreptamines. Acetyltransferase determination by the method of Shannon and Phillips and that by van de Klundert et al. most frequently assumes for the formation of AAC(3)-II and AAC(3)-I. Assays utilizing radioactive labels in amikacin-resistant strains determine the enzymes APH(3') and AAD(2")-II.
