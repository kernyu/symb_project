An airway epithelial cell line (CF/T43) was developed by infecting cultured airway epithelial cells from patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) with the pZIPneoSV(X)1/SV40T retrovirus and selecting for G418 resistance and ion transport properties. The distinctive chloride secretory phenotypes of the CF cell line CF/T43 and a normal cell line (NL/T4) were not perturbed by SV40T-induced cell transformation. Epithelial cell lines generated from CF cells with the SV40T gene can be used to test candidate CF genes and to evaluate the molecular mechanisms responsible for the CF phenotype.
