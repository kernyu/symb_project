Several mutants of B. stearothermophilus have been isolated that are resistant to the antibiotic kasugamycin. One of these is shown to lack dimethylation of two adjacent adenosines in the 16S ribosomal RNA. All mutants that were analyzed biochemically lack the enzyme that is able to methylate this site. Ribosomal sensitivity and resistance to kasugamycin in B. stearothermophilus is therefore, like in E. coli, closely connected with dimethylation of the adenosines.
