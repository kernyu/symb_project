In vitro testing of P. falciparum chemosensitivity was assessed from 2 severe malaria cases in which the parasite was thought to be resistant to chloroquine. The 3 following methods were compared in both cases. 1.--Maturation test, carried out before and from the outset of treatment, is a rapid and simple method. Primary efficiency of therapeutic procedures can be estimate and the eventually adjust. 2.--Rieckmann test, on patient blood, measure chemosensitivity of host strain modulated by hosts factors. Initially proposed for epidemiological trials, this method is of interest for the choice of treatment at the end of acute phase in individuals cases. 3.--Strain chemosensitivity measurement, require one or more weeks of Plasmodium cultivation. This value will be very helpful to estimate the sensitivity level of P. falciparum to chloroquine in the outcoming strain area.
