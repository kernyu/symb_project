Shigella strains showed that in 43.9 per cent of the strains this feature was controlled by conjugative R plasmids. On the whole these were the plasmids allotting the bacterial cell with resistance simultaneously to SmTcCm (37.1 per cent) and SmTc (17.1 per cent). The plasmids with other phenotypes were less frequent: SmApCm, 11.4 per cent, TcApCm, 8.6 per cent; SmTcApCm, 8.6 per cent; Tc, 8.6 per cent; Sm, 2.9 per cent; Cm, 2.9 per cent and TcCm, 2.9 per cent. The incompatibility groups of 19 plasmids were determined: Inc I zeta, 28.6 per cent; Inc zeta I and Inc B, 14.2 per cent; Inc FII, 8.6 per cent and Inc I alpha, 2.9 per cent.
