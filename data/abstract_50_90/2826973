We obtained a clinical isolate of Providencia stuartii showing a high level of resistance to norfloxacin and to other 4-quinolones, whose target is the enzyme DNA-gyrase. This strain showed resistance also to beta-lactam and aminoglycoside antibiotics. In order to detect modification of DNA-gyrase, we performed supercoiling assays in vitro in presence of norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin. Furthermore, outer membrane proteins, which are involved in permeability mechanisms, were analyzed on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Results showed that both modifications in DNA-gyrase and changes in outer membrane proteins can be held responsible for resistance to 4-quinolones; moreover, these modification are probably supported by a third mechanism of resistance.
