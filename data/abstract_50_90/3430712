Flomoxef (FMOX; 6315-S), a new synthetic oxacephem antibiotic, was studied in the pediatric field and pharmacokinetic and clinical results obtained were summarized below. 1. The activity of FMOX against Staphylococcus aureus isolated from clinical patients, including latamoxef resistant strains was very high and MIC was approximately less than or equal to 0.39 microgram/ml. This MIC value was lower than other cephem antibiotics such as cefotaxime, cefotiam, cefmetazole, cefamandole. The distribution of MIC's of FMOX against Escherichia coli and Salmonella spp. ranged from 0.05 to 0.78 microgram/ml and from 0.05 to 0.39 microgram/ml, respectively. 2. Serum concentrations of FMOX after dosages of 20 mg/kg and 40 mg/kg with 1 hour intravenous drip infusion were 21.5-27.5 micrograms/ml, 6.00-7.81 micrograms/ml, 0.37-0.59 micrograms/ml at 1, 2, 5 hours after administration, respectively, and T1/2(beta) were 0.61-0.83 hour. Serum concentrations after one shot intravenous injection of 20 mg/kg FMOX were 56.7-90.2 and 0.20-0.26 micrograms/ml at 3-10 minutes and 6 hours after administration, respectively, T1/2(beta) was 1.22 hours and urinary excretion rate was 66.7-69.8% in 6 hours. 3. FMOX was administered to 32 cases (upper and lower respiratory tract infection, and purulent infections) at 3-4 times daily for 4-13 days. In these cases the daily dosage amounted to 41-119 mg/kg. Clinical effectiveness was 97% overall including resistance cases upon other cephem antibiotic treatment. All bacterial species identified including Branhamella catarrhalis, Streptococcus pyogenes, S. aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Haemophilus influenzae were eradicated upon the treatment with FMOX. 4. Only 3 cases of soft stool, 1 case of elevated GOT and GPT, and 1 case of elevated GPT were observed, and all of these adverse reactions were normalized after the completion of treatment.
