We have constructed two plasmid vectors, pHCV5 and pHVTl, which will replicate both in Haemophilus and in Escherichia coli. Both contain the ampicillin-resistance gene and the replication origin from a Haemophilus plasmid, pRSF0885. Both also contain the pBR322 origin and therefore can be amplified in E. coli by chloramphenicol treatment. The plasmid pHCV5 contains the tetracycline-resistance gene of pBR322, and pHVT1 contains the analogous region from the transposon Tn10.
