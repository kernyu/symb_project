Synthetic polyanions have been shown to alter host resistance to infection. The anticryptococcal effect of pyran copolymer was assessed in vivo and in vitro. Pretreatment with pyran copolymer significantly extended mean survival in mice lethally infected with Cryptococcus neoformans when compared to untreated animals (p less than 0.01). The anticryptococcal effect of peritoneal exudate cells (PEC) elicited by 10% thioglycollate or pyran copolymer (25 mg/kg) was assessed in vitro. Initial percent phagocytosis of both encapsulated and non-encapsulated isolates of C. neoformans was greatest in the pyran elicited PEC. Significant killing of C. neoformans in vitro was observed only in pyran-activated PEC cultures combined with non-encapsulated cells of C. neoformans, although pyran PEC did inhibit initial growth of phagocytized encapsulated yeast cells. The protection of pyran copolymer pretreated mice from infection with C. neoformans, but the absence of significant killing of encapsulated yeast in vitro suggest a complex mechanism of host defense which may involve an activation of the reticuloendothelial system by pyran copolymer.
