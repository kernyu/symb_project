A methicillin-resistant strain of Staphylococcus aureus (phage type 47,54,75,83A) became epidemic in our 50 bed level III nursery, with a colonization rate of 70 percent and an infection rate of more than 25 percent. This prevalence and the appearance of gentamicin resistance necessitated epidemic control measures. Standard measures included separate housing for infants in whom colonization had occurred and infants in whom it had not, low nurse to patient ratios, and cohorting of all personnel. Use of all antibiotics was curtailed by the requirement of infectious disease consultation. Gentamicin was available only on order of the Director. The colonization rate fell from 55 percent to 25.4 percent, the first-week colonization rate from 31 percent to 0 percent, and the infection rate from 29.3 percent to 15.9 percent over eight weeks. The mean duration of antibiotic therapy decreased from 12.21 to 9.05 days per treated patient; however, the frequency of gentamicin usage and the proportion of gentamicin resistance were unchanged. Nurse to patient ratios were modified to allow increased admissions, but cohorting was continued for 12 weeks until all infants in whom colonization had occurred were discharged. With the elimination of the reservoir, no further colonization occurred and antibiotic resistance did not reappear. Standard infection control measures can eliminate epidemics of multiple antibiotic-resistant Staph. aureus, and control of antibiotic usage may present re-emergence of resistant strains.
