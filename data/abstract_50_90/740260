A microbiological assessment was made of 829 urine specimens to determine the percentage incidence of different bacterial species and their susceptibility to antibiotic treatment. It was found that E. coli was most common, followed by Pseudomonas, Proteus, Staphylococcus, Candida, faecal Streptococcus, and Shigella. The results suggest that the aetiological agent should be systematically ascertained and an antibiogram run before a treatment programme is laid down.
