Myxococcus coralloides D was found to produce a substance with a narrow range of antibacterial activity. This substance was produced during the exponential growth phase and was not inducible by ultraviolet light or mitomycin C treatment. The bacteriocin was precipitable by ammonium sulphate, and showed resistance to heat (100 degrees C for 10 min), trypsin, lysozyme, beta-glucuronidase, DNase, RNase, acetone, ethyl ether, urea and mercaptoethanol; it was partially destroyed by pronase and inactivated at extreme pH values. Electron microscopy did not reveal any phage-like particles associated with bacteriocin activity.
