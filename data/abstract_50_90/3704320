The stability of experimentally induced resistance to halofuginone, decoquinate or arprinocid in lines of Eimeria tenella, was examined after 10 passages in unmedicated chickens. There was no loss of resistance to halofuginone or decoquinate. Resistance to arprinocid was unaffected in a line developed in the presence of 150 ppm of the drug but was unstable in a line developed with 60 ppm.
