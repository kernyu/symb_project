The emergence of resistance to imipenem by Pseudomonas aeruginosa was investigated with four pairs of isolates. Each pair represented pretherapy (susceptible) and posttherapy (resistant) specimens. In all cases, the imipenem-resistant isolates did not demonstrate changed susceptibilities to other beta-lactams. Agarose gel electrophoresis revealed no change in plasmid profiles between any pair of isolates. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the Sarkosyl-insoluble membrane protein revealed the loss of an outer membrane protein of apparent molecular mass 48 to 49 kilodaltons in posttherapy strains when grown with imipenem selection (5 micrograms/ml). There was no significant difference in the binding of [14C]imipenem to the penicillin-binding proteins of the pre- and posttherapy strains. Trichloroacetic acid precipitation of membranes isolated after growth in the presence of [14C]imipenem revealed that significantly less drug was bound to Sarkosyl-soluble membrane protein in three of the four posttherapy strains than the membrane proteins of the respective pretherapy strains. beta-Lactamase activity against imipenem at 100 or 3 microM was not detected in any isolate either with or without induction. These data suggest that resistance to imipenem is associated with the loss of a 48- to 49-kilodalton outer membrane protein accompanied by, in three of four cases, decreased penetration of the antibiotic across the outer membrane.
