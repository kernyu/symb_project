Between the period of August 1973 and May 1974, 553 roasting chickens, soup chickens, ducks, and geese from seven different countries were examined for the presence of Salmonella. In 284 (= 51,4%) specimens 23 various Salmonella serotypes were discovered. Out of 475 Salmonella isolates 244 (= 51,4%) were resistant to streptomycin, the sulfonamide complex or their combination whereas 195 (= 41,0%) were sensitive to all eight tested antibiotics. Of greater importance for nutritive and therapeutic application of antibiotics is, however, the resistance of 36 (= 7,6%) Salmonella strains to tetracyclines, ampicillin and kanamycin, 28 (= 5,9%) of the salmonellae showing resistance exclusively to tetracyclines. The water tested from 10 thawed specimens 2 of which contained diphosphates, produced dubious results with the general inhibitor test. Regarding the bacterial yield, both the selenite and tetrathionate enrichments were of equal value. Nevertheless with each individual enrichment the isolated partial amount of the entire collection of positive samples was not identical so that the highest yield of Salmonella was obtained from a combination of both methods. Incubation of the selenite enrichment at a maximum of 43 degrees C definitely produced a higher percentage than at 37 degrees C. A selenite enrichment proved to be superior to that of tetrathionate for the isolation of Salmonella serotypes which rarely occur in fowl. The excellent selectivity of the Brilliant-green Phenol-red Lactose Sucrose Agar, as repeatedly described in the literature, is also confirmed by these tests.
