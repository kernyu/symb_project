The expression of bacterial resistance to UV irradiation and nitrofurantoin by a novel R-plasmid pEB017 in DNA-repair-proficient (wild-type) and -deficient (recA; uvrA) host strains was compared to the effects of plasmid pKM101 in the isogenic strains. pEB017 partially protected the uvrA strain, and completely protected the wild-type and recA strains from the killing effect of UV irradiation; pKM101 had no effect on the recA strain and only enhanced the survival of the wild-type and the uvrA strains after UV irradiation. pEB017 conferred nitrofurantoin resistance 10-fold on the wild-type and the recA strains and 4-fold on the uvrA strain; pKM101 did not confer nitrofurantoin resistance on the wild-type and recA strains but gave 4-fold resistance in the uvrA strain.
