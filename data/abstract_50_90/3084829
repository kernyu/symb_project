Antibacterial activity of (+)-negamycin (NGM) prepared by a new method was investigated for some bacteria. The results demonstrated that this antibacterial activity of synthesized NGM was almost the same as compared to that of naturally obtained NGM, and was also effective to Pseudomonas aeruginosa harboring multiple drug resistant plasmid kR102.
