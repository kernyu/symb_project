Studied was the age-associated dynamic of gamma globulins and of the bactericidal and lysozyme activity of the blood serum in 30 pigs on a swine-breeding complex. It was found that the bactericidal activity was well manifested in 1- to 3-day-old pigs: 58.2-67.5 per cent. In newborn pigs prior to sucking no bactericidal and lysozyme activity was found. By the tenth to 20th day the bactericidal activity sharply dropped, and later on it slowly rose. Lysozyme activity showed a rising trend from birth up to the 30th day. No gamma-globulins were found in newborns prior to sucking. Their level proved highest in 1- to 3-day-old pigs, and lowest-in 20-day-old ones. Digestive disorders up to the 5th day following birth prevented the utilization of gamma-globulins in colostrum 50 per cent and more.
