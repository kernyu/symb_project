The effects of two exposures of the gastric mucosa to either 10 mM taurocholic acid (TcA) or 20% ethanol, both in 150 mM HCl, on transmucosal potential difference (PD) and net fluxes of H+, Na+, and K+ ions have been tested in the rat. The interval between exposures was 30 min. The results demonstrated that the first exposure of the gastric mucosa, either to TcA or to ethanol, reduced the net fluxes of H+, Na+, K+ and the change in transmucosal PD induced by the second exposure, indicating an increased resistance of the mucosa to the barrier breaking effects of TcA or ethanol.
