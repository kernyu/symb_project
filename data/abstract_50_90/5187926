Sixteen methicillin-resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus obtained from Europe were found to be sensitive to the lytic activity of lysotaphin. With only minor exceptions, the strains were found to be sensitive to novobiocin, erythromycin, fusidic acid, and lincomycin, and slightly less sensitive to vancomycin and chloramphenicol. All strains were resistant to tetracycline, penicillinase-sensitive penicillins (benzylpenicillin, ampicillin, and propicillin), penicillinase-resistant penicillins (methicillin, nafcillin, ancillin, oxacillin, cloxacillin, and dicloxacillin), and two cephalosporin antibiotics (cephalothin and cephaloridine).
