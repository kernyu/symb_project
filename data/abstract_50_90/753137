From the comparison between antibiograms of bacterial species isolated from biological materials of wards with a high infection risk (General Intensive Care Unit and Neurosurgical Intensive Care Unit) and wards for internal diseases (General Medicine and Paediatric Wards), the AA. met with a very high frequency of bacterial species with identical sensitivity to antibiotics in the General Intensive Care Unit and Neurosurgical Intensive Care Unit. The data reported indicates a high cross-infection risk in the above Wards.
