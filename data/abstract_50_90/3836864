The present paper reviews the newly-developed cephalosporins and considers their potential for filling the gaps left by earlier cephalosporins in terms of of spectrum of activity, pharmacokinetic parameters, development of resistance and tolerability. Research on narrow-spectrum cephalosporins, directed specifically against enterobacteria and Pseudomonas, on cephalosporins with a low inoculum effect and on oral cephalosporins is discussed. The chemical substitutions responsible for enhancing or reducing the activity of cephalosporins against various bacteria, for altering pharmacokinetic behaviour and for producing unwanted side-effects are described.
