A study was carried out on the drug resistance as associated with the virulence of Staphylococcus aureus strains isolated from cows with endometritis. Hirota's method was employed to ascertain that resistance to penicillin, erythromycin, neomycin, and kanamycin was governed by plasmids. It was found at the same time that, fairly often, with the elimination of some of the resistant markers the virulence of the strain variants also dropped. However, these two properties did not correlate with each other.
