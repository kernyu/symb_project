A series of stable mutants bearing nuclear genetic markers were developed from the established chicken cell line DU24. The mutants were obtained after mutagenesis of DU24 cells with ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) or arose spontaneously when plated in the appropriate selective medium. Clones resistant to 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) were obtained following a two-step selection procedure and analyzed. The BrdUr cells were found to be deficient in thymidine kinase activity and were HAT sensitive. Molecular characterization of these mutants revealed no deletions or other rearrangements, but methylation of some cytosine residues was decreased in the mutants. A similar restriction profile was seen in a series of mutants made resistant to BrdU after cultivation of DU24 cells in increasing concentrations of the drug over a period of six months. Selection of EMS-treated BrdUr cells in 10 microM ouabain gave rise to a clone resistant to both drugs and which was still HAT sensitive. Clones resistant to 6-thioguanine were also isolated, but showed wild-type hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase activity and were HAT resistant. A number of the cell lines isolated were found to be suitable for fusion experiments with both chicken cells and cells from other vertebrate species.
