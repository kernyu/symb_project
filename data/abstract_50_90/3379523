H-2 congenic strains expressing resistant (H-2q, H-2f) or susceptible (H-2k) haplotypes were compared for their ability to resist challenge infection with N. dubius following a 6- or 14-day ivermectin-abbreviated immunizing infection. B10.BR mice (H-2k) were considerably more resistant to infection when the priming interval was shortened from 14 to 6 days. B10.Q (H-2q) and B10.M (H-2f) mice resisted challenge regardless of which immunization regimen was used. The influence of parasite numbers on the response to challenge was studied by comparing infections in resistant DBA/1 (H-2q) and susceptible CBA/J (H-2k) mice that differ at both H-2 and non-H-2 genes. DBA/1 mice, immunized with 50 or 150 L3 of N. dubius for 14 days, resisted challenge, whereas mice receiving 300 worms did not. In contrast, CBA/J mice failed to resist challenge at all priming doses tested. When the immunizing infection was shortened from 14 to 6 days, DBA/1 mice resisted challenge regardless of priming dose and CBA/J mice resisted challenge only when the highest dose of 300 worms was used for priming. The data suggest that susceptible strains of mice may be preferentially immunosuppressed, particularly at low infective doses, and that suppression is associated with adult worms present in the lumen of the small intestine.
