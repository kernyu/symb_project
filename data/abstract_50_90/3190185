The antimicrobial activity and spectrum of ceftibuten (7432-S; SCH 39720) was determined on a wide variety of bacterial species selected for resistance to oral and parenteral beta-lactam antimicrobial agents. Ceftibuten was found to be the most active beta-lactam tested against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, inhibiting 81.6% of strains at less than or equal to 8.0 micrograms/ml compared with 75.0 and 54.8% of strains inhibited by cefixime and cefuroxime, respectively. All strains of Haemophilus influenzae (MIC for 90% of strains [MIC90], less than or equal to 0.06 microgram/ml), Branhamella catarrhalis (MIC90, 3.0 micrograms/ml), and pathogenic Neisseria spp. (MIC90, less than or equal to 0.06 and 0.019 microgram/ml) were susceptible to ceftibuten. Beta-hemolytic Streptococcus spp. (serogroups A, B, C, and G) were also inhibited by ceftibuten, but penicillin-resistant pneumococci were generally resistant to cefixime and ceftibuten. The activity and spectrum of ceftibuten seem most applicable to infections of the respiratory and urinary tract plus those infections caused by pathogenic Neisseria spp. Ceftibuten disks (30 micrograms) were evaluated and found to have an acceptable correlation (r = 0.88) with ceftibuten MICs. Preliminary zone size interpretive criteria for MIC breakpoints of less than or equal to 4.0 and less than or equal to 8.0 micrograms/ml were calculated.
