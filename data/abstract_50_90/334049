The effect of treatment of the protoplasts and cell membranes of C. albicans with polyenic entibiotics on formation of the ribosomal-membrane complex was studied in vitro. It was shown that amphotericin B and nystatin had no effect on this process. Significant suppression of the ribosome binding with the membranes was observed only in vivo in the presence of levorin. The role of the structural changes occurring in the membranes on formation of the polyen-sterol complex, as well as the role of the lipid components of the membrane in binding of the ribosomes is discussed.
