Actinobolin was evaluated in vitro by a paper disc-agar diffusion method for inhibitory activity against mixed microbial cultures obtained from patients with periodontal disease and against pure bacterial cultures tentatively identified as strains of Bacteroides melaninogenicus, Fusobacterium fusiforme, Leptotrichia buccalis, and Veillonella parvula. Every culture tested was inhibited to some degree by actinobolin. These observations suggest that actinobolin may be effective in the treatment of periodontal disease.
