Cephalosporin and related antibiotics are highly effective bactericidal agents of relatively low toxicity. The spectrum of activity varies with the drug but is usually broad. The first-generation cephalosporins, and especially cefazolin, are most active against sensitive staphylococci and streptococci. Most second-generation (except cefoxitin) and third-generation cephalosporins show substantial activity against Haemophilus influenzae. All cephalosporins (except cefsulodin) are active against Klebsiella, Escherichia coli, and Proteus mirabilis, whereas only the third-generation agents have pronounced activity against the other Enterobacteriaceae. Imipenem (a carbapenem) is active against essentially all pathogenic organisms, but aztreonam (a monobactam) is active against only aerobic gram-negative bacilli. Advantages associated with some of the new cephalosporins are once-daily administration and high cerebrospinal fluid levels. With the development of new cephalosporins, however, new toxicities have become apparent, and superinfections and induction of resistance have become greater problems. The cephalosporins are among the most expensive antibiotics in use today; thus, use of these expensive agents must be justified by lower toxicity, greater efficacy, or both in comparison with drugs of more reasonable cost.
