Pyocins from Pseudomonas aeruginosa were used to select several lipopolysaccharide (LPS) mutants of Neisseria gonorrhoeae strain FA19. Three classes of LPS mutans were found in the initial group selected for study. The LPS of one class lacked galactose. That of a second group lacked the typical heptose found in the parental LPS, was reduced in glucose, galactose, and N-acetylglucosamine content, appeared to contain a new unidentified sugar component, and consisted of two species of LPS separable on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. The LPS of a third strain lacked the heptose, glucose, galactose, and N-acetylglucosamine found in the oligosaccharide portion of parental FA19 LPS. The minimal inhibitory concentration for polymyxin B of the mutant strains was 3 to 4 times that of the parental strain. The strains lacking only galactose were as resistant as the parent to the bactericidal action of normal human serum, but cells of the other two classes were quickly killed by serum. Gonococcal LPS thus appears to be important in determining phenotypic properties of the cells.
