Plasmid pPR328 has been constructed for use as a chloramphenicol-resistant, intermediate cloning vector when manipulating DNA fragments cloned in vectors of the pUC family. The method used in its construction may be of general use for the replacement of the ampicillin resistance marker of pBR322-based plasmids with other drug resistance cassettes.
