The electrophoretic analysis of the plasmid DNA of multiresistant clinical E. coli strains revealed the presence of extrachromosomal DNA in 97% of the strains. The plasmid nature of resistance was established in 88-100% of E. coli strains resistant to chloramphenicol, ampicillin, streptomycin or kanamycin and in 67% of the strains resistant to tetracyclin. 24 out of 40 strains contained conjugative R-plasmids in which the determinants of resistance to kanamycin, ampicillin and chloramphenicol were transferred most frequently (82-93%), while the determinants of resistance to tetracyclin and streptomycin were transferred less frequently (45% and 35%, respectively). Nonconjugative R-plasmids were detected in 15 out of 40 antibiotic-resistant strains; in these plasmids the determinants of resistance to streptomycin (65%) and tetracyclin (22%) were transferred most frequently.
