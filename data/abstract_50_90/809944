Bordetella bronchiseptica is primarily resistant against nitrofurantoin (MIC greater than 200 mug/ml), and this feature can be used for the differentiation of the organism from other gram-negative coccobacteria. Nitrofurantoin paper disks (300 mug) failed to affect the growth of 150 strains of B. bronchiseptica isolated from different animal hosts, but they produced marked inhibition zones in the cultures of the followingspecies: Pasteurella multocida, Pasteurella pneumotropica, Pasteurella haemolytica, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, Yersinia enterocolitica, Francisella tularensis, Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Brucella abortus, Brucella melitensis, Brucella suis and Brucella neotomae.
