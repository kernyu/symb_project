Cell free extracts from a streptomycin-resistant E. coli mutant which is also temperature-sensitive for Q beta phage were studied for suppression of a nonsense mutation at various temperatures. The streptomycin-resistant ribosomes of the mutant were found to be temperature-sensitive in suppression of an amber mutation in f2 phage coat protein while retaining the ability to synthesize proteins at an elevated temperature (42 degrees C). The restriction of amber suppression at 42 degrees C is assumed to be related to an alteration in ribosomal protein S12 of the streptomycin-resistant mutant which also causes a change in its electrophoretic mobility.
