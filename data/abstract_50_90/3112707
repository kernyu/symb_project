Among all Gram-negative bacilli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa is one of the most resistant to aminoglycosides. Five hundred and seventeen P. aeruginosa strains were studied. Isolates came from three Paris hospitals. Reference strains were provided by P. Courvalin and A. Philippon. The following aminoglycosides were used: streptomycin (S), spectinomycin (Sp), kanamycin (K), neomycin (N), gentamicin (G), sisomicin (Ss), netilmicin (Nt), tobramycin (T), amikacin (A), habekacin (H). The in vitro activity of antibiotics was evaluated by the standardized disk agar diffusion test. Distribution of inhibition zone diameters among susceptible strains were represented by histograms. Resistance frequency to aminoglycosides was: G: 61.5%, Ss: 38.1%, T: 35.8%, Nt: 58.2%, A: 15.5%, Seven resistance patterns were identified: G: 3%, G Ss: 3%, G Nt: 8%, G Ss Nt: 7%, G Ss T: 5%, G Ss T Nt: 53%, G Ss T Nt A: 21%. Hypothesis about resistance mechanisms and interpretation of disk agar diffusion test are discussed.
