A total of 952 blood and 1543 urine isolates of gram-negative bacilli from hospitalized patients in 1986-1987 were consecutively collected by 10 Swedish laboratories and tested for susceptibility to 8 beta-lactam antibiotics and to gentamicin. The isolates were mostly Escherichia coli (58% and 44%, respectively) and Klebsiella sp. (17% and 18%). Resistance to ampicillin in blood and urine isolates was found in 35% and 45%, respectively, to piperacillin in 5% and 6%, to cephalothin in 26% and 34%, to cefuroxime in 12% and 22%, to cefotaxime in 3% and 5%, to ceftazidime in 1% and 1%, to imipenem in 0.5% and 0.1%, to aztreonam in 3% and 2%, and to gentamicin in 0.8% and 0%. Resistance of clinically important gram-negative bacilli to new beta-lactam antibiotics and to gentamicin is infrequent in Sweden.
