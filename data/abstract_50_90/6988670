The phenotype of a kasugamycin dependent mutant, MV17, was found to be the product of a kasugamycin resistance mutation in ksgA, together with a dependentizing mutation in rplW, the gene for large ribosomal subunit protein L23. Revertants from dependence on this small subunit targeted antibiotic were found to have mutational laterations in ribosomal proteins L23, L1, L11, and S9. The mutations causing alterations in L1 and L23 were shown to be responsible for the reversion and that altering L11 to be involved in the reversion.
