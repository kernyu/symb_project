During a 9-month period when amikacin was the sole aminoglycoside used clinically in a hospital in Santiago, Chile, resistance to amikacin and other antibiotics was encountered in 42 strains of the family Enterobacteriaceae, including Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, and Serratia liquefaciens. Amikacin resistance was transferable by conjugation and carried by IncM plasmids ranging in size from ca. 48.4 to 58.1 kilobase pairs. The plasmids had ca. 70 to 80% of their structure in common, as judged after digestion with restriction endonucleases. The resistance was mediated by a 6' aminoglycoside acetyltransferase. We conclude that selective pressure has favored the dissemination of a wide-host-range amikacin resistance plasmid and its derivatives.
