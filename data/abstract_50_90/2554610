We here report the results of an investigation of the effect of interferon on the establishment of new infections by a retrovirus. For this study, we used an infectious but replication-incompetent retrovirus carrying a drug-resistance gene and assayed for infectivity by measuring drug-resistant colony formation. Mouse interferon-beta inhibited retroviral infection of mouse CG1 cells in a dose-dependent manner. However, a higher dose of interferon was needed for eliciting the antiretroviral effects than for action against vesicular stomatitis virus. The degree of antiretroviral effect was comparable over at least a 100-fold range of multiplicity of infection and the effect was most pronounced when the cells were continuously treated with interferon before infections and during infection and drug-selection.
