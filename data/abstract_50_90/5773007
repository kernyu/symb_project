Three streptomycin-resistant mutants of group H streptococcus, strain Challis, were examined for ability to accumulate (14)C-streptomycin. Although the mutants exhibited different levels of transformation, only the streptomycin-sensitive parent Challis strain accumulated significant amounts of (14)C-streptomycin. It appears that impermeability to streptomycin does not necessarily result in reduction or loss of transformability. The amount of label accumulated by strain Challis was correlated with a loss of viability. In addition, accumulation of label was influenced by the concentration of (14)C-streptomycin, the time of exposure, and the type of medium employed.
