Sensitivity of Styphimurium strains isolated under conditions of a hospital infection to antibiotics were studied in comparison with the strains of the given serological type isolated from other sources and with the strains of other serological types of groups B, C, D and E. It was shown that the strains causing outbreaks of hospital infections were characterized by polyresistance to 7 out of 9 antibiotics tested. All the Salmonella strains tested were sensitive to gentamicin and about a half of them was sensitive to polymyxin M.
