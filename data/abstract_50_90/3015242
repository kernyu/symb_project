A cosmid library of Rhodopseudomonas capsulata DNA was constructed in Escherichia coli HB101 using the broad-host-range cosmid vector pLAFR1. More than ninety per cent of the clones in the bank contained cosmids with DNA inserts averaging 20 kilobase pairs in length. Mutants deficient in uptake hydrogenase (Hup-) were obtained from R. capsulata strain B10 by ethylmethylsulfonate (EMS) mutagenesis. The content of hydrogenase protein in Hup- mutant cells was tested by rocket immunoelectrophoresis. Hup- mutants (Rifr) were complemented with the clone bank by conjugation and, from the transconjugants selected by rifampicin and tetracycline resistance, Hup+ transconjugants were screened for the ability to grow photoautotrophically and to reduce methylene blue in a colony assay. The recombinant plasmid pAC57 restored hydrogenase activity in the Hup- mutants RCC8, RCC10, RCC12 and ST410 whereas pAG202 restored that of IR4. The cloned R. capsulata DNA insert of pAC57 gave 5 restriction fragments by cleavage with EcoRI endonuclease. Fragment 1 (7 kb) restored hydrogenase activity in Hup- mutant strains RCC12 and ST410 and fragment 5 (1.3 kb) in strains RCC8 and RCC10. Since the 2 cosmids pAC57 and pAG202 are different cosmids, as indicated by restriction analyses and absence of cross hybridization, it is concluded that at least two hup genes are required for the expression of hydrogenase activity in R. capsulata.
