Specimens obtained from pyogenic skin lesions of 210 dogs were culturally examined for staphylococci. A total of 215 isolates of staphylococci were biotyped, using the biochemical tests contained in a commercial staphylococcal identification system. Of 201 coagulase-positive isolates, 197 were identified as Staphylococcus intermedius, 3 as S aureus, and 1 as S hyicus. Of 14 coagulase-negative isolates, 5 were identified as S epidermidis, 5 as S xylosus, 3 as S simulans, and 1 as S hominis. Antimicrobial susceptibility tests were done on all staphylococcal isolates, using the standard disk-diffusion method. Staphylococcus intermedius isolates were susceptible to cephalothin, methicillin, and gentamicin. Resistance to ampicillin, penicillin G, and tetracycline was frequent. Antibiotic resistance was not associated with the depth of skin infection. Resistance to ampicillin, penicillin, tetracycline, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was not associated with previous antibiotic use. Increased resistance to chloramphenicol, clindamycin, and erythromycin was associated with previous antibiotic therapy. Antimicrobial susceptibilities of the other Staphylococcus species isolated are reported, but the small numbers of these species precluded making meaningful comparison with S intermedius.
