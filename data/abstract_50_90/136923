A total of 700 Shigella cultures isolated in different regions of the Ukraine in 1974 and occasionally in 1971-1973 were studied. No cultures resistant to furazolidone or enteroseptol were found. Under the experimental conditions resistance to nitrofuran and especially oxycholine preparations in Shigella developed slowly when the cultures were passaged in broths with increasing concentrations of the drugs. Cross resistance in Shigella was observed with respect to (a) various nitrofuran preparations, less pronounced with respect to furacryline and (b) enteroseptol and 5-NOK. No cross resistance was noted between the above groups of the chemotherapeutics and levomycetin and tetracycline. 5-NOK inhibited the resistance development to streptomycin, while enteroseptol inhibited the development of resistance to furazolidone in Shigella. The studies showed that in the near future there will be observed no mass development of resistance to furazolidone and enteroseptol in Shigella.
