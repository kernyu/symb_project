Some of the elements required of a mathematical model for the evolution of anthelmintic resistance in strongylid nematodes are described. The model comprises a series of coupled first order differential equations and assumes the parasite has a direct life cycle with overlapping generations. The parasite-host system involved only a single host. In all the cases considered, drug resistance was assumed to be determined by two alleles at a single autosomal locus. The pretreatment allelic frequencies were maintained by heterozygote advantage involving the mortality of the free-living stages of the parasite. The model suggests that alternating anthelmintic with different modes of action may be a less effective resistance management strategy than administering the same drugs simultaneously.
