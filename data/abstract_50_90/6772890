Pseudomonas infections continue to be an important problem in the hospital environment. Serious infections are always invariably associated with severe underlying conditions or with diminished host resistance. The increasingly resistance of strains and hospital epidemics favour the organism prevalence. During 1978, Pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated in 154 cultures from a variety of biological samples in the hospital. Tests of biochemical identification, serological typing, and typing by pyocine production were carried out. Susceptibility to aminoglycosides and beta-lactamic antibiotics was also tested. Serological study demonstrated a higher incidence of 4 and 11 serotypes; 69.4 percent corresponded to type I when typing by pyocine production was carried out. No relationship between serotypes and pyocine-types has been found. Ticarcillin showed a greater activity than carbenicillin (minimal inhibitory concentration less than or equal to 16 micrograms/ml). Amikacin, tobramicin, sisomicin and gentamicin inhibited 83.7 percent, 73.6 percent, 70.7 percent and 69.4 percent of the isolated strains, respectively.
