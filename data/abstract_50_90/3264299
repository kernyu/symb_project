Lethal effect of Listeria monocytogenes (L. monocytogenes) in mice was prevented by an intraperitoneal (ip) injection of a traditional Chinese herbal medicine, xiao-chai-hu-tang (Japanese name: shosaiko-to), 4 days before ip bacterial infection. The numbers of bacteria in the peritoneal cavity and liver were smaller in shosaiko-to-treated mice from one day after the infection. Macrophage accumulation in the peritoneal cavity after ip inoculation of L. monocytogenes was observed in both untreated and shosaiko-to-treated mice. Although rates of such increases were almost the same between both groups, the absolute number of macrophages was larger in shosaiko-to-treated than in untreated mice because of a higher level of the macrophage number at 4 days after ip injection of shosaiko-to. In untreated mice, bactericidal activity of peritoneal macrophages decreased from one day to 3 days after ip injection of killed L. monocytogenes. Such an activity was maintained at the same level from 1 to 3 days in shosaiko-to-treated mice. Augmented accumulation of macrophages and maintenance of their bactericidal activity may be main mechanisms of the augmented resistance in shosaiko-to-treated mice. Augmented resistance against bacterial growth in the thigh muscle in ip shosaiko-to-treated mice may be caused by such mechanisms. The effect of shosaiko-to observed at an early stage of infection may be T cell-independent, since such an effect was observed in athymic nude mice and delayed footpad reaction could not be detected at such a timing in euthymic normal mice.
