The isolation of an acid-fast microorganism of the genus Mycobacterium is reported. Its most relevant characteristics are the intense red color and the initial spheric shape of colonies which furtherly evolve to a peculiar division. The biochemical products from test bacteria as niacin, nitrase, lipase, phosphatase, TCH, catalase, peroxidase and a series of 11 amides as well as the tests for susceptibility against antibacillary drugs and biological tests are described. The patterns obtained permit the characterization of this species as one non previously described. The name Mycobacterium cubense, n. sp. is suggested.
