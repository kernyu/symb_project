751 stems of Gram-negative bacteria isolated from urinary samples with bacterial charge greater than or equal to 100,000 CFU (Colony Forming Units)/ml gathered from January 1981 to December 1982 have been examined. The sensitivity to the following chemoantibiotics has been tested: ampicillin, cefuroxime, amikacin, gentamicin, tobramycin, nalidixic acid, pipemidic acid, nitrofurantoin, co-trimoxazole. A very good sensitivity to pipemidic acid, amikacin, from all species considered (Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, gr. Klebsiella-Enterobacter, Pseudomonas) and a good sensitivity to co-trimoxazole (with the exception of Pseudomonas) have been found. A decidedly low sensitivity has been found to nitrofurantoin and ampicillin from all species considered. It is also pointed out how the stems isolated in hospital patients are more resistant (with statistical significance by analysis of variance) than the corresponding species isolated in ambulatory patients.
