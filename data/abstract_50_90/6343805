The lipid content of Salmonella typhimurium was examined after growth in the presence of benzylpenicillin, ampicillin, mecillinam and tetracycline in nutrient broth and a defined medium with either glucose, acetate or glycerol as the sole carbon source. The total lipid content was not changed significantly but the level of palmitoleic acid was higher in antibiotic treated cells with the level of C17 delta being lower. The level of phospholipids was increased slightly in antibiotic treated cells, with phosphatidylserine and diphosphatidyl glycerol being the most affected. The results are discussed in terms of antibiotic resistance and mode of action of the beta-lactam antibiotics.
