Antibiotics available to treat uncomplicated anogenital infections due to beta-lactamase-producing Neisseria gonorrhoeae include spectinomycin, ceftriaxone, and clavulanic acid added to aqueous procaine penicillin G or amoxicillin. Important variables in deciding which antibiotic regimen to use include effectiveness against urethral, cervical, pharyngeal, and rectal infections; cost; eradication of coexisting incubating syphilis; adverse effects; efficacy against strains of N. gonorrhoeae with chromosomally mediated resistance to antimicrobial agents; ease of administration; patient acceptance; and the potential for inducing resistance to antimicrobial agents in pathogens other than those causing sexually transmitted diseases. This review outlines the advantages and disadvantages of the various regimens.
