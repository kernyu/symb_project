In seven human melanoma cell lines and one human fibroblast strain some correlation of resistance to cell killing was found with two bifunctional alkylating agents (melphalan, chlorambucil) and three monofunctional agents (4(5)-(3,3-dimethyl-l-triazeno)imidazole-5(4)-carboxamide (DTIC), methylmethane sulphonate (MMS) and N-methyl-N1-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG), but little cross-resistance was found between these two groups of agents or with cytosine arabinoside (ara-C). In contrast to previous studies with rodent tumours, potentially synergistic (chloroquine, arginine) or antagonistic (ascorbic acid, leucine) compounds did not affect the toxicity of melphalan in a human melanoma cell line. In two melanoma lines DTIC induced patterns of DNA damage (inhibition of semi-conservative synthesis) and repair (strand breaks and repair synthesis) similar to, but not identical with, those induced by the methylating agent MMNG. These results suggest that a methylating species is derived from DTIC but has a different reactivity toward DNA compared with MNNG.
