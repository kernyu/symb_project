Two chloramphenicol resistance mutations were isolated in an Escherichia coli rRNA operon (rrnH) located on a multicopy plasmid. Both mutations also confer resistance to 14-atom lactone ring macrolide antibiotics, but they do not confer resistance to 16-atom lactone ring macrolide antibiotics or other inhibitors of the large ribosomal subunit. Classic genetic and recombinant DNA methods were used to map the two mutations to 154-base-pair regions of the 23S RNA genes. DNA sequencing of these regions revealed that chloramphenicol-erythromycin resistance results from a guanine-to-adenine transition at position 2057 of the 23S RNA genes of both independently isolated mutants. These mutations affect a region of 23S RNA strongly implicated in peptidyl transfer and known to interact with a variety of peptidyl transferase inhibitors.
