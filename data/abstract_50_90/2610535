Fifty four patients with postresection gastritis and 13 healthy adults were examined. 141 microbial cultures belonging to 33 species were isolated from the gastric juice of the patients. In the healthy persons 27 cultures belonging to 7 species were isolated from the gastric juice. In the gastric juice of the patients there predominated enteric bacteria and enterococci (64.8 +/- 6.5 and 57.4 +/- 6.7 per cent respectively). Among the enteric bacteria Escherichia coli and Proteus spp. were the most frequent. Contamination of the gastric juice by such microbes amounted to 10(5)-10(9) microbial bodies per 1 ml. The isolates were mainly sensitive to gentamicin (84.8 +/- 2.9 per cent).
