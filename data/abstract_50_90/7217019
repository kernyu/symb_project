Monomeric and oligomeric forms of a 5.0 x 10(6)-dalton plasmid (conferring erythromycin resistance) were able to genetically transform naturally competent Streptococcus sanguis. Transformation with electrophoretically purified monomer was a second-order process, whereas transformation with a dye-buoyant density gradient-purified plasmid preparation followed one-hit kinetics.
