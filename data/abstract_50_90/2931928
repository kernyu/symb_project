The immunological analysis of 24 spontaneous Strr, Rifr and Kanr mutants of streptococcal strain IP, highly virulent for mice and capable of binding polyclonal human IgG (IgG FcR+), was made. The characteristic feature of all these mutants was decreased virulence, restored after their passage in vivo. 23 mutants were capable of binding polyclonal IgG; one Strr mutant had no such capacity, but acquired it, together with an increase in virulence, after its passage in vivo. When stored in meat-peptone agar without antibiotics, 5 out of 10 Strr mutants lost their capacity for binding polyclonal human IgG. After passage in vivo they regained this property simultaneously with virulence.
