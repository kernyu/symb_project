Methods for the synthesis of esters and amides of edeine A were developed and a number of derivatives of this type was obtained and characterized. The antimicrobial activities of the derivatives are comparable to the activity of the native antibiotic and indicate that the presence of free carboxyl group in edeine is not essential for its biological assay.
