Sensitivity of 80 Pseudomonas aeruginosa cultures forming melanin and 80 cultures synthesizing other pigments to amikacin, gentamicin, kanamycin, carbenicillin, levomycetin, monomycin, 5-NOK, polymyxin M, rifampicin, streptomycin, tetracycline, tobramycin and erythromycin was determined. It was found that the cultures of Ps. aeruginosa synthesizing melanin were less resistant to most of the antibiotics that the other representatives of this species.
