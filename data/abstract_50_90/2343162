The pituitary neural lobe of homozygous Brattleboro rats has high rates of glucose utilization not affected by chronic treatment with exogenous vasopressin, despite attenuation of polydipsia and polyuria. We evaluated whether this effect may result from the inability of vasopressin to affect the hypothalamo-neurohypophysial metabolism or from the development of resistance to chronic vasopressin treatment. We used the [14C]deoxyglucose method to compare 28-h effects of vasopressin treatment (5 U/kg, i.m., twice a day) with that of desmopressin (100 micrograms/kg, i.p., once a day), a long-lasting antidiuretic hormone, on glucose utilization of the hypothalamo-neurohypophysial system and related structures in conscious homozygous Brattleboro rats. Vasopressin and desmopressin reduced water intake, plasma osmolality and plasma Na+ concentration similarly. Vasopressin decreased glucose utilization in the supraoptic nucleus, subfornical organ and median preoptic nucleus, but did not alter activity in the paraventricular nucleus and neural lobe. Desmopressin decreased glucose utilization in all these structures. The results indicate that desmopressin has a more potent inhibitory action on the hypothalamo-neurohypophysial system than vasopressin over this short duration of treatment. The lack of response in the neural lobe from chronic treatment with vasopressin seems to be due to its inability to affect the paraventricular nucleus metabolism. The maintenance of metabolic activity in the paraventricular nucleus of vasopressin-treated Brattleboro rats suggests that this structure contributes importantly to the metabolism of neural lobe.
