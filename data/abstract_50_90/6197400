This study was performed to prove that intestinal colonization in chickens by resistant Escherichia coli strains present in the environment might be prevented when faeces in which sensitive E. coli strains were dominant was administered to newly hatched chicks. The appearance of resistant E. coli strains was markedly reduced. Escherichia coli O49:H12 was the sensitive E. coli strain which formed the major colonizer in the intestinal tract. In young chickens, this strain persisted as a major component, and even when it was a minor colonizer in the faecal fluid administered, it appeared as a major component soon afterwards. This strain is considered to be a good colonizer in the gut of young chickens.
