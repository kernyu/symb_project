The disc diffusion technique was evaluated with 178 strains of anaerobes and four cephalosporins (cephalothin, cefamandole, cefazolin and cefoxitin). Good correlation in results was found in comparison with the agar dilution technique (p less than 0.001) with the exception of cefamandole and cefazolin against anaerobic cocci (p greater than 0.05). Choosing a breakpoint of 8 microgram/ml for distinguishing susceptible and resistant strains, we determined corresponding incubation, the rate of error is less than 1% for false susceptible and less than 5% for false resistant. However, some strains of anaerobic cocci required a 48 hour incubation period for allowing visible growth. Moreover, a great deal (60.5%) of overlapping zone diameters made interpretation of disc diffusion test difficult among Bacteroides fragilis strains classed as susceptible, intermediate and resistant occuring with cefoxitin. The results have shown that the cephalothin disk will not accurately predict susceptibility of B. fragilis to cefoxitin.
