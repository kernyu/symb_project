Different patterns of resistance against commonly used macrolide, lincosamide, and streptogramin antibiotics were found in Clostridium perfringens of animal origin. The patterns were designated as (i) macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin group B generalized resistance, (ii) macrolide-lincosamide generalized resistance, (iii) macrolide-lincosamide inducible resistance, and (iv) macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin low-level generalized resistance. The strains of the fourth pattern were able to inactivate pristinamycin and virginiamycin. The macrolide-susceptible strains showed a bimodal distribution of lincomycin and clindamycin susceptibility levels. The susceptible strains were inhibited by 0.25 micrograms of lincomycin per ml and 0.03 micrograms of clindamycin per ml. The low-level resistant strains were inhibited at concentrations of 2 to 4 micrograms of lincomycin per ml and 0.5 to 2 micrograms of clindamycin per ml.
