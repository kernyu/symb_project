The susceptibility of 175 clinical isolates of Neisseria gonorrhoeae to penicillin G, ampicillin, erythromycin, tetracycline and spectinomycin was determined. Almost one-fifth of strains were relatively resistant to penicillin G. Relative resistance to penicillin G was significantly correlated with resistance to ampicillin, tetracycline and erythromycin, but not with resistance to spectinomycin. No penicillinase-producing or spectinomycin-resistant strains were encountered in this study. The relevance of the findings to the management of gonococcal urethritis is discussed.
