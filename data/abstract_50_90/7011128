Seven strains of Salmonella typhimurium were isolated from 2 fecal samples of calves, and the strains were resistant to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, kanamycin, nalidixic acid, streptomycin, sulfadimethoxine, and tetracycline. Also, 11 Escherichia coli strains were obtained from 1 of the 2 samples, and these strains possessed the identical drug resistance patterns as did the salmonellae. The thermosensitive R plasmids conferring sextuple drug resistance and mercury resistance from Salmonella strains were Fi- (no fertility inhibition) and belonged to incompatibility group H1, whereas conjugative 6 R plasmids isolated from 11 E coli strains were Fi+ (fertility inhibition) and belonged to incompatibility group FII. Thermosensitive R plasmids conferring sextuple drug (ampicillin, chloramphenicol, kanamycin, streptomycin, sulfadimethoxine, and tetracycline) have not been reported in Japan. Genetic relationship of R plasmids derived from the multiresistant strains of Salmonella and E coli was discussed on the basis of incompatibility properties of R plasmids.
