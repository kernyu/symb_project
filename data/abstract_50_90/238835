Venturicidin is a specific inhibitor of aerobic growth of yeast and has no effect on fermentative growth, a result which is consistent with its known mode of action on mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. Venturicidin-resistant mutants of Saccharomyces cerevisiae have been isolated and form two general classes: class 1, nuclear mutants which are resistant to a variety of mitochondrial inhibitors and uncouplers, and class 2, mitochondrial mutants of phenotype VENR OLYR and VENR TETR in vivo. VENR OLYR mutants show a high degree of resistance to venturicidin and oligomycin at the whole cell and mitochondrial ATPase level but, in contrast, no resistance at the mitochondrial level is observed with VENR TETR mutants. Venturicidin resistance/sensitivity can be correlated with two binding sites on mitochondrial ATPase, one of which is common to the oligomycin binding site and the other is common to the triethyl tin binding site. Biochemical genetic studies indicate that two mitochondrial genes specify venturicidin resistance/sensitivity and that the mitochondrial gene products are components of the mitochondrial ATPase complex.
