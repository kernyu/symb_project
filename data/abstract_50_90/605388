The frequency of cybrid colony formation was measured in fusions between enucleated chloramphenicol (CAP)-resistant mouse cells and CAP-sensitive mouse cells in varying ratios. By labeling the CAP-resistant cytoplasts with polystyrene beads and then performing the same fusions with CAP-sensitive cells, the frequency of cybrid fusions could be measured. Comparison of the frequency of viable cybrids (cybrid colonies) with the frequency of cybrid fusions showed that, with increasing fusion ratios of cytoplasts to cells, the proportion of cells fused to cytoplasts increased. Further, the viability of cybrid fusions increased from about 1 in 500 to nearly 1 in 60 over the range of cytoplast-to-cell ratios studied.
