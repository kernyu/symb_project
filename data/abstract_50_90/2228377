Histoid lepromas are a rare eruption in patients with lepromatous leprosy. A 59-year-old man from India with lepromatous leprosy who developed histoid lepromas and who was dapsone resistant was studied. These tumors resembled cutaneous metastases. This Indian man is to our knowledge the first patient to be reported with this rare disorder in the continental United States.
