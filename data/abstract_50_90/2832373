Some human colonic Bacteroides strains carry conjugal tetracycline resistance (Tcr) elements, which are thought to be chromosomal. We have found that some of these Tcr elements can mediate the appearance of plasmidlike forms in Bacteroides uniformis 0061. When B. uniformis 0061, containing a conjugal Tcr element designated Tcr ERL, was grown in medium containing tetracycline (1 microgram/ml), two circular DNA forms were found in the alkaline plasmid preparations: NBU1 (10.3 +/- 0.5 kilobases) and NBU2 (11.5 +/- 0.5 kilobases). Restriction analysis of NBU1 and NBU2 showed that they were not identical, although Southern blot analysis indicated that they did contain some region(s) of homology. Results of Southern blot analysis also demonstrated that both NBU1 and NBU2 were normally integrated in the chromosome of B. uniformis or in some undetected large plasmid. Although we were unable to determine the exact structure and location of the integrated forms of NBU1 and NBU2 in B. uniformis, they appear to be in close proximity to each other. Neither NBU1 or NBU2 could be detected as a plasmidlike form in cells exposed to UV light, thymidine starvation, mitomycin C, or autoclaved chlortetracycline (50 micrograms/ml). Four conjugal Tcr elements other than the Tcr ERL element were able to mediate the appearance of NBU1 alone, and two Tcr elements did not mediate the excision of either NBU1 or NBU2. Three strains from different Bacteroides species contained some DNA sequences which had homology to NBU1 and NBU2.
