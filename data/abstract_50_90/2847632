During a 14-month period beginning in July 1986, three distinct clinical isolates of Streptococcus (Enterococcus) faecium demonstrating high-level resistance (MIC, greater than 2,000 micrograms/ml) to gentamicin, kanamycin, tobramycin, and streptomycin were recovered from individual patients at one institution. Combinations of ampicillin with any of these agents failed to show bactericidal synergism. By filter-mating techniques, high-level gentamicin resistance could be transferred into a susceptible recipient of the same species at frequencies as high as 1 x 10(-4); transfer into Streptococcus faecalis JH2-7 occurred at lower frequencies (less than 2 x 10(-7). Aminoglycoside substrate profile analysis of clinical isolates as well as of laboratory-derived cured strains and transconjugants revealed 2"-aminoglycoside phosphotransferase and 3'-aminoglycoside phosphotransferase (III) phosphorylating enzymes, AAC-6' acetylating activity above that attributable to the intrinsic activity characteristic of S. faecium, and a streptomycin adenylylating enzyme. All three isolates carried a 51-megadalton plasmid. Curing of this plasmid or conjugative transfer into susceptible recipients was associated with the loss or acquisition of high-level gentamicin resistance, respectively. Loss of high-level gentamicin resistance was also observed when curing techniques resulted in a decrease in the size of this plasmid equivalent to a 10-megadalton deletion. Transferable, high-level resistance to gentamicin and other aminoglycosides, which was previously recognized in S. faecalis, has now emerged in clinical isolates of S. faecium, with the attendant concerns for possible spread.
