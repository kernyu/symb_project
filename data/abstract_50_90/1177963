Mutant Chinese hamster ovarian (CHO) cells with a resistance to 7-10(-7) and 8-10(-7) M cycloheximide (CHM) were induced at mutation rates of 1.9-5.2-10(-3) and 1.6-1.8-10(-3) respectively after treatment with N-nitrosomethylurea (NMU) at 100 mug/ml. The induced mutation rates differed by two orders of magnitude from the spontaneous rate of mutation to CHM resistance.
