The Streptococcus faecalis pheromone-dependent conjugative plasmid pAD1::Tn916 and the membrane filter-dependent conjugative plasmid pPD5::Tn916 were used to introduce Tn916 into Staphylococcus aureus by intergeneric protoplast fusions and intergeneric membrane-filter matings. In recombinants obtained by protoplast fusion where no plasmid DNA could be detected, tetracycline resistance resulted from transposition of Tn916 from pAD1 to the S. aureus chromosome. Transformation analyses showed that S. aureus Tn916 chromosomal insertions occurred near pig, ilv, uraA, tyrB, fus, ala, and the trp operon. DNA hybridization analyses of EcoRI- and HindIII-digested chromosomal DNAs confirmed the diversity of chromosomal sites involved and demonstrated that the inserts were Tn916 insertions rather than integrations of all or part of pAD1::Tn916. Both pAD1::Tn916 and pPD5::Tn916 were transferred to S. aureus by membrane-filter matings. These plasmids remained intact and expressed tetracycline resistance in S. aureus. S. aureus strains carrying pAD1::Tn916, but not a chromosomal insert of Tn916, and any one of several conjugal gentamicin-resistance plasmids lost their ability to serve as conjugal donors of the gentamicin-resistance plasmids.
