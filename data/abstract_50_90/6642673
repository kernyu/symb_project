In previous studies, we have shown that a 27-megadalton plasmid (pRW002) in Staphylococcus aureus contains genetic determinants for exfoliative toxin B (ET B) and bacteriocin (Bac R1) synthesis and Bac R1 resistance. Attempts to transform or transduce this plasmid to S. aureus or Bacillus subtilis recipients were not successful. However, genetic transfer of the plasmid was possible after polyethylene glycol-induced fusion of S. aureus protoplasts containing pRW002 and S. aureus protoplasts lacking this plasmid. Some of the resulting fusants lost the ability to make ET B, Bac R1, or both products. Fusants that were Bac R1-, Bac R1s, ET B- all lacked the 27-megadalton pRW002 plasmid. The largest class of fusants was Bac R1+, Bac R1r, ET B-. Immunodiffusion analyses of ET B extracts from 28 fusants showed that four ET B+ strains were cross-reacting mutants that produced ET B protein that was serologically related to, but not identical to, the wild-type toxin. Results indicated that genetic transfer of pRW002 after protoplast fusion induced molecular rearrangements that resulted in mutation of the genetic determinants for ET B and Bac R1 synthesis. Recombination of chromosomal genes was enhanced after CaCl2 was added to the protoplast-fusion mixture.
