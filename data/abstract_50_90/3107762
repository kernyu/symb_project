A 25-year-old factory worker sustained inhalation injury and 2 per cent deep burns while fighting a fire in his factory (LSI factory) which was made of new synthetic building materials. He became unconscious and inhaled noxious substances from the smoke. Although he survived the acute stages following injury, his pulmonary function subsequently deteriorated with a damaged trachea and bronchi, repeated attacks of pneumonia, atelectasis, pneumothorax and lung fibrosis, leading to death with hypercapnia (PaCO2 more than 100 mmHg) after 205 days in hospital. Autopsy revealed scarring contraction and dilatation of the trachea and bronchi, acquired bronchiectasis, lobular pneumonia, bleeding, hyperaemia and oedema of the lungs. Systemic administration of corticosteroids was only transiently beneficial in reducing the increased airway resistance.
