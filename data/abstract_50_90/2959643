Teicoplanin and rifampicin were evaluated as single and combined agents in the treatment of endocarditis due to Staphylococcus epidermidis in the rabbit model. Rabbits were treated for ten days and the number of bacteria in vegetations determined. At the end of ten days the geometric mean number of bacteria in the vegetations were 5.53 X 10(8), 6.68 X 10(6). 1.10 X 10(4), 2.57 X 10(1) cfu/g of vegetation for control, teicoplanin, rifampicin, and teicoplanin plus rifampicin groups respectively. The MIC and MBC values of the S. epidermidis isolates were 0.78 mg/l for teicoplanin and less than or equal to 0.10 mg/l for rifampicin. In the rifampicin treated group three post-treatment isolates of S. epidermidis tested exhibited marked resistance to rifampicin with MIC and MBC values greater than or equal to 200 mg/l. Teicoplanin and rifampicin were both effective as single agents in the clearance of S. epidermidis from the bloodstream. Rifampicin was more effective than teicoplanin in the clearance of S. epidermidis from vegetations but teicoplanin in combination with rifampicin was more effective than either drug alone.
