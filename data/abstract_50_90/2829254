A low copy number cosmid was constructed by subcloning the pair of cos sites and the kanamycin resistance gene of pcos2EMBL into pGB2. The resulting cosmid, pPR691, has the pSC101 replicon and specifies resistance to kanamycin, spectinomycin, and streptomycin. pPR691 also carries restriction sites suitable for cloning partial Sau3A digests using the strategy of Bates and Swift (P. F. Bates and R. A. Swift, 1983, Gene 26, 137-146). A library of Salmonella typhimurium chromosomal DNA was made using this cosmid and the rfb gene cluster (map position 42) was isolated from this library.
