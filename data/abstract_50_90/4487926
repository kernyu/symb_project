The way in which hospital-acquired infection has been brought under control over a three-year period in a district general hospital is described. The main success has been achieved in reducing sepsis caused by Staph. aureus, especially methicillin-resistant strains, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. These reductions were achieved in spite of inadequate ward isolation and operating theatre facilities, and before there was any marked change in patterns of prescribing antibiotics. Our experiences indicate the significant improvements that can be made in controlling nosocomial sepsis even without structural or other major alterations in a hospital, providing that the problem is fully appreciated and the infection control team are concerned enough to act vigorously in influencing their clinical colleagues.
