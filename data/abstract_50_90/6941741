N-Formimidoyl thienamycin (MK0787) was compared in vitro with three other beta-lactam and two aminoglycoside antibiotics. It was second in activity only to cefotaxime against members of the Enterobacteriaceae and to amikacin against Pseudomonas species. It was the most active antibiotic against Staphylococcus aureus. Resistance (minimal inhibitory concentration, greater than 128 microgram/ml) to N-formimidoyl thienamycin was not observed.
