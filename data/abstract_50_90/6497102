Disk diffusion susceptibility tests were done on 1,178 clinical strains of coagulase-positive staphylococci (CPS) isolated from dogs during a 7-year period. Relative decreases of 7% to 33% were found in the percentages of CPS sensitive to 8 antimicrobics. Relative percentages of CPS sensitive to 9 other antimicrobics were increased or decreased less than 5%. Sensitivity to the beta-lactam antibiotics showed the least relative change. Regression analysis demonstrated that the greatest change in percentage sensitivity of CPS occurred to gentamicin and cephalothin and the least change occurred to penicillin and ampicillin. Recent canine clinical isolates of CPS, specifically identified as Staphylococcus intermedius (n = 109), were uniformly sensitive to novobiocin, amikacin, tobramycin, spectinomycin, and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid. Twenty-two isolates were also sensitive to 17 other antimicrobics. Eighty-seven isolates were resistant to 1 or more antimicrobics tested. Resistance was most common to sulfonamides, penicillin G, ampicillin, tetracycline, and streptomycin. Differences in susceptibility results between S intermedius and unspecified CPS were not statistically significant.
