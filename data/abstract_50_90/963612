Forty-seven strains of Streptococcus bovis were tested for bacteriocin production. Fourteen were found to produce bacteriocins, while all 47 were sensitive to at least one of these bacteriocins. The bacteriocins, on the basis of their host range on S. bovis strains, formed six groups. A representative of each group was selected and characterized by temperature stability, sensitivity to trypsin and lipase, sedimentation by centrifugation, ability to pass through dialysis tubing, host range on other bacterial species, and conditions for production in liquid media. A correlation between mannitol fermentation and bacteriocin production was noted.
