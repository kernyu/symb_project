Thirty-four clinical isolates of the family Enterobacteriaceae from the University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center appeared resistant to ticarcillin-potassium clavulanate in agar dilution and broth macrodilution tests. Among those isolates producing a single non-class I beta-lactamase, resistance was due to production of high levels of TEM-1, SHV-1, or class IV enzymes. In five Escherichia coli isolates, production of low levels of PSE-1 was responsible for resistance which seemed due to rapid hydrolysis of ticarcillin rather than diminished susceptibility of PSE-1 to inhibition by potassium clavulanate. Comparisons of dilution and disk diffusion tests revealed major discrepancies, with 65% false susceptibility in the disk test. Revision of the interpretive criteria used for disk diffusion tests from less than or equal to 11 to less than or equal to 18 mm for resistance is proposed to resolve these discrepancies until clinical data are obtained which can be used to determine which in vitro test is most predictive of therapeutic outcome. These new criteria would diminish false susceptibility without introducing false resistance.
