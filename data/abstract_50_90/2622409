500 Micromonospora cultures were subdivided into nine groups on the basis of their cultural-morphological properties, the ability to produce antibiotics of certain chemical classes, and the sensitivity to 18 different antibiotics: aurantiaca (I), cinnamomea (II), cinnamomea-vinacea (III), cinnamomea-olivacea (IV), nigra (V), nigra-violacea (VI), lilacinescens (VII), coerulea (VIII) and brunnea (IX). Cultures belonging to groups I, II, III, V and VI are moderately sensitive to most of the antibiotics and often occur in natural substrates. Black Micromonospora cultures (groups V and VI) mostly produce aminoglycoside antibiotics while brown cultures (groups II and III) form macrolide antibiotics. Cultures belonging to groups IV, VII, VIII and IX have a higher sensitivity to most of the antibiotics and are rarely isolated from natural substrates. These cultures have a weak ability to produce antibiotics.
