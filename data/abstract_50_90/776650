A comparative study on the therapeutic value of the II line drugs (ethoxide, prothionamide, cycloserin) and bacteriostatics (ethambutol anf rifampicin), with their action upon experimental tuberculosis produced by streptomycin- or isoniazid-resistant mycobacteria of the bovine type, was carried out. This showed rifampicin and ethambutol to be mose effective. Ethoxide and prothionamide proved more efficient when acting upon isoniazid-resistant strains. Cycloserin turned out to be virtually inactive with regard to both streptomycin- and isoniazid-resistant mycobacteria.
