Mutants in the cyclic AMP (cAMP) control system in Salmonella typhimurium (cya = adenyl cyclase, crp = cAMP receptor protein) were partially resistant to growth inhibition by 22 antibiotics (including fosfomycin, nalidixic acid, and streptomycin) and 29 inhibitory analogs of normal bacterial fuel/carbon sources. This resistance was used as the basis for an efficient positive selection of cya and crp mutants. We propose that these antibiotics and analogs enter the bacteria through transport systems normally used for transporting fuel/carbon sources and that this is accomplished because of a structural similarity between the antibiotic and the natural substrate of the particular transport system involved. We propose that these transport systems are all under positive control by cAMP and that cAMP acts as a signal molecule (alarmone) for fuel/carbon deprivation. Evidence is provided for a hierarchy within operons controlled by cAMP. The methodology is shown to be useful for analyzing both antibiotic transport systems and the cAMP super-control system.
