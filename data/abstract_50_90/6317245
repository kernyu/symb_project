The emergence of beta-lactamase producing strains of Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae has required fundamental changes in the antimicrobial therapy of disease caused by these organisms. Ampicillin resistance in both organisms is caused by plasmid mediated production of TEM beta-lactamase. This enzyme is specified by a sequence of mol. wt 3.2 X 10(6) which is capable of inserting itself at multiple sites in DNA replicons without the requirement for significant base sequence homology between donor and recipient replicon. Further, it does so without requirement for conventional recombination enzymes. Analysis of beta-lactamase specifying plasmids of H. influenzae show that they generally have a molecular mass in the order of 30 X 10(6) and contain the complete TnA sequence. They are conjugative but are incapable of mobilizing smaller beta-lactamase plasmids. Previous studies have presented evidence suggesting that these plasmids may have evolved by insertion of the TnA sequence (perhaps introduced from enteric bacteria) into a phenotypically cryptic plasmid of mol. wt 27 X 10(6) resident in rare strains of H. influenzae. In this study, we review data showing a high degree of homology between the small (3--7 X 10(6) mol. wt), nonconjugative beta-lactamase specifying plasmids of N. gonorrhoeae, H. parainfluenzae and H. ducreyl and present new evidence that cryptic plasmids highly homologous to the beta-lactamase plasmids are present in many strains of H. parainfluenzae. This suggests that the small beta-lactamase specifying plasmids of H. parainfluenzae, H. ducreyi and N. gonorrhoeae may have arisen by insertion of TnA into phenotypically cryptic plasmids present in H. parainfluenzae.
