Aeruginocine typing and an antibiotic sensitivity test were conducted on 277 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from dead-in-shell embryos and on water from waterers of a chick hatchery. Thirty different aeruginocine patterns were obtained using 8 Wahba indicator strains. Of the 277 strains, 129 were typable and 148 were not. The aeruginocine typing patterns of the strains isolated from dead-in-shell embryos and water were similar, suggesting that contaminated water may be the source of infection. Antibiogram revealed that all the strains were resistant to methicillin and tetracycline, and had varying degrees of resistance to other antibiotics tested.
