The clinical and laboratory findings in two cases of aerobic Corynebacterium Group JK infection of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunts are described. These organisms have occasionally been reported as a cause of serious infections in man but have not been reported as a cause of shunt infection. In both cases, CSF pleocytosis was limited to 20 or 60 cells with variable protein and sugar values. Fever was a constant finding, frequently accompanied by signs of central nervous system dysfunction. Corynebacterium Group JK organisms are common contaminants of the normal skin flora. When isolated from the blood and/or the CSF of a patient with a CSF shunt who has symptoms and signs compatible with infection, the organism should not be dismissed as a contaminant. A significant feature of this group is its resistance to almost all presently available antibiotics including penicillin, the cephalosporins, and the aminoglycosides. These organisms are, however, sensitive to vancomycin.
