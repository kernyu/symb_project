Inactivated canine parvovirus (CPV) and inactivated feline panleukopenia virus (FPV) vaccines were evaluated in dogs. Maximal serologic response occurred within 1-2 weeks after vaccination. Antibody titers then declined rapidly to low levels that persisted at least 20 weeks. Immunity to CPV, defined as complete resistance to infection, was correlated with serum antibody titer and did not persist longer than 6 weeks after vaccination with inactivated virus. However, protection against generalized infection was demonstrated 20 weeks after vaccination. In unvaccinated dogs, viremia and generalized infection occurred after oronasal challenge with virulent CPV. In contrast, viral replication was restricted to the intestinal tract and gut-associated lymphoid tissue of vaccinated dogs. Canine parvovirus was inactivated by formalin, beta-propiolactone (BPL), and binary ethylenimine (BEI) in serum-free media; inactivation kinetics were determined. Formalin resulted in a greater loss of viral HA than either BEI of BPL, and antigenicity was correspondingly reduced.
