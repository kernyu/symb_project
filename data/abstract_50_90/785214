Sodium nalidixate inhibited the cell growth and division of several respiratory competent strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. A number of cytoplasmic petite strains (both spontaneous and induced by ethidium bromide) were shown to be more resistant to sodium nalidixate than the wild-type strains from which they were derived. There was considerable variation in sensitivity of different petites derived from the same wild-type. Usually petite strains which were induced by ethidium bromide were more resistant than spontaneously arising petites. The susceptibility of a wild-type strain to nalidixate was found to be least when the mitochondrial respiratory system was maximally repressed. It was also noted that sodium nalidixate (100 mug/ml) induced petite mutants.
