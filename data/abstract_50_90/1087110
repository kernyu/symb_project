Ampicillin sodium has been the drug of choice in the treatment of Haemophilus influenzae meningitis. The development of ampicillin-resistant strains forces the clinician to focus on alternative therapies.

An historical perspective summarizing the evolution of available therapeutic regimens is presented.
