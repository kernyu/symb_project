Three cases of meningitis and two of septicaemia were caused by pneumococci resistant to the penicillins/cephalosporins and chloramphenicol. No beta-lactamase was demonstrated in any of the organisms. All three patients with meningitis died, but the patients with septicaemia recovered after being given appropriate antibiotic therapy.
