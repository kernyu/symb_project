The cases of M. tuberculosis detected in cerebrospinal fluid of the patients with tuberculous meningitis being under observation during 1968-1987, are analysed. The second decade (1978-1987) witnessed a greater percentage of M. tuberculosis found in the cerebrospinal fluid of the patients (including children, adolescents and adults). Children and adolescents constituted the majority of the cases. M. tuberculosis agents were detected by means of bacterioscopy and inoculation in 33.3 and 66.7% of the patients, respectively. In 15.5% of the cases, primary resistance to antibacterial drugs was revealed. The detection of M. tuberculosis in the cerebrospinal fluid is now considered to be an unfavourable factor indicating the severity of the disease and entailing, to a certain extent, its adverse outcome. Antibacillary drug resistance of the M. tuberculosis strains isolated from cerebrospinal fluid may serve as an aggravating condition. As a rule, the disease in these cases has a serious course, making the treatment much more difficult and causing unfavourable outcomes.
