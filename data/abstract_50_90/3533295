From January 1984 to June 1985, 20 out of 65 P. falciparum strains isolated in an hospital in Paris were epidemiologically suspect of resistance to chloroquine. 15 of them were submitted to in vitro chemosensitivity tests with several antimalarials drugs. In cases of suspected chloroquine resistance the initial choice of an alternative drug is mainly presumptive and is generally not guided by the in vitro chemosensitivity assay which results are too much delayed. When in vitro assay shows sensitivity to amino-4-quinolines treatment can be modified accordingly. The determination of plasma concentration of drugs are required in any case. However in vitro sensitivity assays would probably appears essential to physicians in cases of resistance to quinine.
