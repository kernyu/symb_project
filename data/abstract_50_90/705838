A prospective study was undertaken over a period of six months to determine the spectrum of infection, sensitivity of organisms isolated, and suitability of antibiotics chosen in 520 consecutive patients admitted to a paediatric unit. Culture and sensitivity of stool, urine and blood yielded 752 isolates; in 147 cases, more than one pathogen was isolated from the same or different sites. High rates of resistance to chloramphenicol, ampicillin, and kanamycin were seen in salmonellae other than Salmonella typhi, which differed in retaining its original sensitive susceptibility profile. Most Enterobacteria were sensitive to gentamicin. Penicillin-resistance was seen in 9% of meningococci, and several Haemophilus influenzae strains (20%) were resistant to ampicillin. Methicillin-resistance was encountered in 13% of Staphylococcus aureus strains and 17% of pneumococci were resistant to penicillin G. The sensitivity pattern of organisms isolated was probably directly related to widespread use of antibiotics.
