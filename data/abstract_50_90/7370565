All clinical isolates of enterobacteria received at the laboratory were monitored for trimethoprim resistance over six months in 1978. The survey was repeated in 1979 and the incidence of trimethoprim resistance showed a slight decrease, but the proportion of resistant strains owing their trimethoprim resistance to transferable R plasmids had almost trebled. There was also a large increase in the proportion of resistant strains exhibiting high-level non-transferable trimethoprim resistance. These findings suggest transposition of genes conferring trimethoprim resistance from plasmids to the bacterial chromosome.
