Raw and treated sewage samples were examined for antibiotic-resistant, lactose-fermenting bacteria. Approximately 1% of the total lactose-fermenting bacteria were multiply resistant. Of these organisms, 50% were capable of transferring all or part of their resistance to a drug-sensitive recipient. Only 43% of those isolated on media containing a single antibiotic were capable of resistance transfer, whereas 57% of those recovered on multiple antibiotic plates transferred resistance. R factors conferring resistance to chloramphenicol, streptomycin, and tetracycline; streptomycin and tetracycline; and ampicillin, streptomycin, and tetracycline accounted for 22, 19, and 15%, respectively, of those identified. The data indicate a significant level of infectious drug resistance among the intestinal bacteria of the urban population.
