For more than 30 years, penicillin has been the agent of choice for pneumococcal infections. During this time the majority of strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae have been highly susceptible to penicillin. However, during the last ten years there have been sporadic reports of pneumococci with increased resistance to penicillin. The case report of an 18-month-old white boy with meningitis due to a strain of S. pneumoniae with increased resistance to penicillin is presented. The MIC of the organism to penicillin was 0.2 mug/ml and the MBC 0.39 mug/ml. The patient had normal immunity and no demonstrable sequestered focus of infection but failed to respond to appropriate doses of intravenous penicillin. Treatment with chloramphenicol caused a dramatic bacteriologic and clinical response. This experience reemphasizes the existence of pneumococcal strains of intermediate penicillin sensitivity and the importance of in vitro susceptibility tests.
