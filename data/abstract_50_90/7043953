By environmental culturing Acinetobacter could be isolated from human sources and wet sites as well as from air and dry surfaces. In variety "anitratus" strains from patients and hospital personal resistance against antibiotics and metal salts was more dominant than in other strains. Acinetobacter strains were more tolerant of dryness than E. coli but less than Micrococcus luteus. By repeated contacts Acinetobacteres could be recovered from contaminated surfaces of polyvinyl chloride in significantly higher numbers than from paving tile.
