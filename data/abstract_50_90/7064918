Pneumococci resistant to penicillin have been reported in increasing numbers world-wide. A survey for resistance to penicillin G in 222 clinical isolates taken from patients in Houston is reported here. Thirteen (5.9%) of the isolates screened exhibited moderate levels of resistance with MIC's ranging from 0.125-0.5 microgram/ml. The authors recommend routine screening for pneumococcal resistance in isolates from blood, cerebrospinal fluid and tissue exudates.
