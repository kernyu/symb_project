The sensitivity of a number of human fibroblast cell strains towards the DNA intercalating and mutagenic agent ethidium bromide has been examined. Among the cell strains investigated, 3 were of fetal origin, 6 from clinically normal adult persons, 2 from Lesch-Nyhan individuals and 1 each from persons with 3 genetic disorders, xeroderma pigmentosum, Fanconi anemia and Bloom syndrome, which are known to predispose to cancer. Results of our studies show that cells derived from 2 otherwise normal individuals exhibits a marked sensitivity towards ethidium bromide as compared to the rest of the group. At the same time all 3 cell strains of fetal origin were found to be highly resistant to killing by this agent. These results are discussed in relation to the toxic/mutagenic effects of ethidium bromide.
