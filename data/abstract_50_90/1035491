An experimental study was conducted into the immunisation of mice to a strain of Pasteurella multocida with pathogenicity for calf. Here are the results: (a) Stable Sm-d mutants were isolated. (b) The genetic stability of this mutant type was established by unsubstantiable reversion up to the magnitude of 10(-8) or - in cases in which 20 Sm-id revertants maximum occurred in 10(-8) Sm-d germs--by prolongation of the generation period of these suppressor mutants which can be defined also as minus mutants. (c) Stable attenuation of selected Sm-d mutants has been established in mice by intraperitoneal application of 108 germs. (d) Live germs with restricted reproduction exhibited more immunogenicity to thermally inactivated antigen.
