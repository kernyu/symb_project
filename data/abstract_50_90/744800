We classified microorganisms from the clinical laboratory by using information provided by the Gram stain and antibiotic sensitivity profiles obtained with the Bauer-Kirby technique. Approximately 4,000 microorganisms, routinely identified and tested for antibiotic sensitivities in a large hospital microbiology laboratory, were used as a data set for several pattern recognition classification methods: K--nearest-neighbor analysis, statistical isolinear multicomponent analysis, Bayesian inference, and linear discriminant analysis. K--nearest-neighbor analysis yielded the highest prospective classification accuracy for gram-negative organisms, 90%. When those organisms displaying an atypical antibiotic resistance pattern were excluded from the data, the gram-negative classification accuracy improved to 95%. These results are inferior to currently accepted biochemical identification methods. Microorganisms with atypical antibiotic resistance patterns are likely to be misidentified and are common enough (17% of our isolates) to limit the feasibility of routine identification of microorganisms from their antibiotic sensitivities.
