Alterations in the ribosomes of sucrose-dependent spectinomycin-resistant (Sucd-Spcr) mutants of Escherichia coli were studied. Subunit exchange experiments showed that 30S subunits were responsible for the resistance of ribosomes to spectinomycin in all Sucd-Spcr mutants tested. Proteins of 30S ribosomes were analyzed by carboxymethyl cellulose column chromatography based on their elution positions. Mutants YM22 and YM93 had an altered 30S ribosomal protein component, S5, and mutant YM50 had an altered protein, S4. Although a shift of elution position was not detected for all the 30S ribosomal proteins from mutant YM101, the amount of protein S3 was appreciably lowered in the isolated 30S subunits. A partial reconstitution experiment with protein S3 prepared from both the wild-type strain and YM101 revealed that the mutant had altered protein S3 which is responsible for the spectinomycin resistance. These alterations in 30S subunits are discussed in relation to the interaction between ribosomes and the cytoplasmic membrane.
