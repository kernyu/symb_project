RO 23-6240 (fleroxacin), pefloxacin, augmentin, cefaclor, cef-uroxime, ceftazidime, vancomycin, piperacillin and amikacin were tested against a wide variety of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. The MICs of fleroxacin were very similar to those of pefloxacin. Against all the bacterial groups tested, the quinolones compared favorably with the other antimicrobials tested, particularly against the more resistant species such as Corynebacterium group JK and D2 and methicillin-resistant staphylococci.
