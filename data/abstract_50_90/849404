Poly(xanthylic acid) [X)n] abolished the ability of (A)n-(U)n to induce interferon in "superinduced" (actinomycin D and cycloheximide) primary rabbit kidney cells. Under the same conditions, (X)n had a relatively minor effect on the interferon inducing capacity of (I)n-(C)n. Evidence based on mixing curves, melting profiles, pancreatic ribonuclease resistance and sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation pointed to the conclusion that the following three reactions occur depending on stoichiometry: (1) 2(A)n-(U)n + (X)n leads to (A)n-2(U)n + (A)n-(X)n; (2) (A)n-(U)n + (X)n leads to (A)n-(U)n-(X)n; (3) (A)n-(U)n + 2(X)n + (X)n-(U)n. The second reaction represents the formation of a new triple helix which can also be formed according to the following reactions: (X)n-(U)n + (A)n leads to (A)n-(X)n-(U)n; (A)n-(X)n + (U)n leads to (A)n-(X)n-(U)n.
