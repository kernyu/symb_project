Two terregenous and four marine bacterial isolates were treated with six antibiotics and antibiotic combinations. Comparisons made between responses of cells in early and late logarithmic and stationary growth phases indicated variable sensitivity to the agents. Bacteria in stationary and late log-phase cultures exhibited the greatest resistance, whereas the early log-phase cells exhibited greatest antibiotic susceptibility. We conclude that the tested antibiotics cannot be used for ecological purposes to delineate bacterial respiration in mixed microbial communities.
