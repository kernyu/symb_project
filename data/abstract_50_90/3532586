Actual bacterial flora was bronchologically examined in 561 patients with inflammatory bronchopulmonary diseases, 291 out of them with acute pictures. Facultative pathogenic organisms were found in 70 per cent of bronchiectases, in 24.4 per cent of pneumonia and in 17 per cent of acute bronchitis. In the first place of infections were Haemophilus influenzae and gram-negative bacteria; in contrast to that pneumococci and staphylococci were less frequent. Sensitivity tests showed that especially in the case of gram-negative organisms and staphylococci a well-directed antibiotic treatment should be carried out.
