A six-laboratory study developed a standardized method for determining the susceptibilities of Neisseria gonorrhoeae strains to penicillin, tetracycline, spectinomycin, and ceftriaxone. Three quality control organisms were also selected, and quality assurance guidelines were initially generated for the disk diffusion and agar dilution methods. The medium recommended for gonococcal susceptibility testing was GC agar with a defined "XV-like" supplement. The supplement should be free of cysteine, a component implicated in the inactivation of some newer beta-lactam compounds. Penicillin, tetracycline, spectinomycin, and ceftriaxone were stable in agar plates stored at 3 to 5 degrees C for at least 2 weeks. Numerous GC agar and drug disk lots were used during the trials without significant variation in test results. Several other gonococcal strains were recommended for additional medium quality assurance. The disk quality control zone limits were established for N. gonorrhoeae ATCC 49226 (formerly CDC F-18) and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923. MIC quality control ranges were also developed for N. gonorrhoeae ATCC 49226 and S. aureus ATCC 29213. The interpretive criteria for penicillin were as follows: susceptibility, greater than or equal to 47 mm (diameter of inhibition zone) (less than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml [MIC]); resistance, less than or equal to 26 mm (greater than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml). For tetracycline they were as follows: susceptibility, greater than or equal to 38 mm (less than or equal to 0.25 microgram/ml); resistance, less than or equal to 30 mm (greater than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml). For spectinomycin they were as follows: susceptibility, >/= 18 mm (</= 32 micrograms/ml); resistance, </= 14 mm (>/= 128 micrograms/ml). For ceftriaxone susceptibility, the criterion was >/= 35 mm (</= 0.25 micrograms/ml) with no other category. Criteria of </= 19 mm for plasmid-mediated resistances to penicillin and tetracycline were also confirmed. The false-susceptibility errors were </= 1% with these criteria.
