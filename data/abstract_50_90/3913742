Escherichia coli cells carrying fosfomycin-resistance plasmids show high levels of resistance towards this drug. However, the plasmid-carrying strains exhibited a transient lytic phase induced by fosfomycin when grown in rich liquid media. This lytic phase was not observed if the cells were grown in liquid minimal media. Fosfomycin-induced lysis depended on the accumulation of drug inside the bacteria, presumably as a result of the saturation of the fosfomycin modification system. Growth recovery after lysis was not due to drug inactivation in the culture medium and could be explained by selection of mutants showing impaired fosfomycin transport when high concentrations of fosfomycin were used. However, there was no selection of mutants with low drug concentrations.
