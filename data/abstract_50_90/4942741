A comparison of clofazimine and dapsone in the management of untreated lepromatous leprosy showed no significant differences between the two drugs in terms of morphological and bacterial indices. The incidence of erythema nodosum leprosum was similar in the two groups. Since dapsone is cheaper than clofazimine it remains the drug of choice for the routine management of untreated lepromatous leprosy.
