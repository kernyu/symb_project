We investigated two phenotypically distinct types of diphtheria toxin-resistant mutants of Chinese hamster cells and compared their resistance with that of naturally resistant mouse cells. All are resistant due to a defect in the process of internalization and delivery of toxin to its target in the cytosol, elongation factor 2. By cell hybridization studies, analysis of cross-resistance, and determination of specific binding sites for 125I-labeled diphtheria toxin, we showed that these cell strains fall into two distinct complementation groups. The Dipr group encompasses Chinese hamster strains that are resistant only to diphtheria toxin, as well as mouse LM cells. These strains possess a normal complement of high-affinity binding sites for diphtheria toxin, but these receptors are unable to deliver active toxin fragment A to the cytosol. Cells of the DPVr group have a broader spectrum of resistance, including Pseudomonas exotoxin A and several enveloped viruses as well as diphtheria toxin. In these studies, which investigate the resistance of these cells to diphtheria toxin, we demonstrate that they possess a reduced number of specific binding sites for this toxin and behave, phenotypically, like cells treated with the proton ionophore monensin. Their resistance is related to a defect in a mechanism required for release of active toxin from the endocytic vesicle.
