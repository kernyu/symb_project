Clinical and pulmonary function changes induced by intravenous dichlorvos (2,2-dichlorvinyldimethyl phosphate) (DDVP) toxicosis, and reversibility of these changes after atropine treatment were investigated in six Friesian calves one to three months old. From one minute after dosage, all animals showed severe respiratory distress, excitation, weakness, muscle fasciculation and cholinesterase inhibition. Decrease in dynamic lung compliance and arterial oxygen tension and increase in total pulmonary resistance, viscous work of breathing and alveolar arterial oxygen gradient were highly significant (P less than 0.01). On the other hand, body secretions, heart rate, respiratory rate, tidal volume and arterial carbon dioxide tension were not significantly affected by DDVP injection. Atropine promptly and completely reversed these changes, except for muscle fasciculations, central depression and cholinesterase inhibition which disappeared progressively within 24 hours.
