1253 urinary tract isolates collected during 9 months (April-December 1984) were analysed by the agar diffusion method for sensitivity to 13 antimicrobial agents commonly used for the treatment of urinary tract infections in children and adults. We noticed an agitatingly high resistance of Escherichia coli to ampicillin, sulphonamide and trimethoprim/sulphamethoxazole and of Proteus spp. to ampicillin. As Kuwait is one of the countries where the total consumption of antibiotics is very high as compared to most of the western countries, we are inclined to assume that this generous policy for the prescription of especially ampicillin and other broad spectrum antibiotics in uncomplicated infections has generated this serious consequence.
