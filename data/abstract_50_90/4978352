Strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa resistant to 256 mug. per ml. or more of carbenicillin (Pyopen) were isolated from 17 patients over a period of three months. The infections were not solely due to cross-infection. Low dosage and attempted eradication of the organism from inaccessible sites, such as the bronchi or skin surfaces, by using systemic treatment are two possible causes. Restraint in treating infections of doubtful importance and the use of local applications to appropriate sites with or without systemic treatment is suggested.
