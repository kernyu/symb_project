From 1972-1977 one hundred and fouteen pyogenic infections of gynaecologic and obstetric patients at UFK Halle had retrospectively been examined. 168 isolations were analysed. By improving the methods of taking away, transporting and bacteriologic cultivation the specimens anaerobic organisms were recovered in 67.3% of all positive results. The pathogenic importance of them is being emphasized by 30,8% of anaerobic monoinfections. The difficult culture of these microogranisms requires a close cooperation between hospital and the place of research. In the treatment surgical operative measures often are preferred to use of chemotherapeutica because of the latter is characterized by a distinctive resistance against numerous antibiotica. This is especially characteristics of Genus Bacteroides besides E. coli the most isolated organism of all.
