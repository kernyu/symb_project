A rifampin-susceptible strain (VSV Rif+) was selected from the wild vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) population unsusceptible to rifampin. The VSV Rif+ was blocked in its intracellular replication in the presence of rifampin. In cells, rifampin affected primarily VSV Rif+ transcription, but to a different extent than in a cell-free system. In addition, a decrease in the amount of VSV Rif+ protein M was detected, linked to a stimulation of protein NS. In the absence of rifampin, protein M, although synthesized, was not immediately incorporated into the cell membrane. An interpretation of these observations is proposed.
