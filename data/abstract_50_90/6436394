Strains of Trypanosoma cruzi differ in their susceptibilities to and metabolism of pyrazolopyrimidines. Allopurinol riboside can control but not eliminate infections with a sensitive strain in both tissue culture and mice. Formycin B, which proved to be greater than 10-fold more effective on a weight basis, showed a similar strain specificity but could eliminate an infection with a sensitive strain from tissue culture. However, this drug, unlike allopurinol riboside, was converted to toxic analogues of adenosine mono-, di-, and triphosphate by uninfected tissue culture cells. Thiopurinol and its riboside were effective against all strains unless culture was performed in purine-defined medium. Thus formycin B and allopurinol riboside appear to be good models for the design of antitrypanosomal agents. Suitable modification of the molecule may provide an effective chemotherapeutic agent.
