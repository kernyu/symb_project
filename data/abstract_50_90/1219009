Endocranial complications, which are undiagnosed or diagnosed late, present the greatest danger in masked mastoiditis. Inadequate treatment will inevitably result in irreversible and progredient loss of conductive hearing. In children, deterioration of the general condition and disturbances in physical development are frequently the first symptoms indicating mastoid infection. Because its pathohistological specifity, a reliable interruption and elimination of the mastoid infection can only be achieved by radiacal mastoidectomy. Negative criticism of mastoidectomy is not supported by recent clinical results. This paper suggests an early indication of radical mastoidectomy in masked mastoiditis.
