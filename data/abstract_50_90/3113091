Pseudomonas aeruginosa has proved to be a dangerous nosocomial pathogen is growing importance. Its pathogenicity is attributable to its great variety of toxic mechanisms which are capable of attacking all parts of the organism, primarily organs with impaired resistance. Antibiotics had been found to yield little lasting success. Therefore, an attempt was made to apply to 30 patients three-per-cent boric acid to cope with locally delimited Pseudomonas wound infections. Therapy could be completed with good success in less than six days on average. Only germ reduction was achievable on three patients with chronic osteomyelitis. Toxic side-effects were not recordable.
