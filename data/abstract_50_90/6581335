The authors have carried out the laboratory and clinical studies of cefotetan (CTT), and obtained the following results. The antibacterial activities of CTT were measured by the plate dilution method against the clinical isolates of S. aureus, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, S. marcescens and Salmonella sp. The susceptibility distribution of S. aureus to CTT was at concentration of 6.25-12.5 micrograms/ml and the peak of that was obtained at 6.25 micrograms/ml with an inoculum size of 10(6) cells/ml. And the peaks of susceptibility distribution of E. coli and K. pneumoniae to CTT were obtained at less than 0.1 microgram/ml respectively, and that of S. marcescens was obtained at 6.25-12.5 micrograms/ml with an inoculum size of 10(6) cells/ml. The growth of all strains of Salmonella sp. was inhibited at concentration of less than 0.1 microgram/ml. As for pharmacokinetic study, CTT was given by intravenous bolus injection and drip infusion for 30 minutes at a single dose of 20 mg/kg. After intravenous bolus injection of 20 mg/kg of CTT, the mean peak serum level was 175.0 +/- 7.0 micrograms/ml at 15 minutes after injection, and half-life time was 3.53 hours. After 30 minutes drip infusion of 20 mg/kg of CTT, the mean serum concentration was 106.0 +/- 6.0 micrograms/ml at end of infusion, half-life time was 2.41 hours. The mean urinary excretion rates were 49.4% and 64.2% up to 8 hours after drip and bolus injection of 20 mg/kg of CTT, respectively. CTT was given 15 cases with bacterial infection. Daily doses of CTT were from 15.0 to 107.0 mg/kg. Clinical results obtained were excellent and good responses in 12 of 15 cases (80.0%). No side effects were obtained except for 2 cases with elevation of GOT and GPT, and 1 case with eosinophilia.
