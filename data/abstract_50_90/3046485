DNA annealing studies indicated that kanamycin resistance in Campylobacter strains from various geographical areas is encoded by a gene structurally related to aphA-3 of gram-positive cocci. This finding confirms the transfer of genetic material between gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria under natural conditions.
