This study compares the minimum inhibitory concentrations of cefoperazone, cefotaxime, and moxalactam (LY127935) for 446 aerobic gram-negative bacillary isolates and further compares the minimum inhibitory concentrations of LY127935 and these third-generation cephalosporins with those of thienamycin for Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Each antibiotic at low concentrations inhibited nearly all Enterobacteriaceae tested. Minimum inhibitory concentrations for P. aeruginosa were higher, but for a majority of strains they fell below achievable serum levels. Thienamycin and cefoperazone showed significantly greater antipseudomonal activity than did cefotaxime or LY127935. Cefoxitin-inducible resistance to LY127935 and the two cephalosporins was demonstrated among Enterobacter species but did not occur with thienamycin.
