An apparently homogeneous strain of Staphylococcus aureus resistant to gentamicin (Gmr), kanamycin, tobramycin, and sisomicin, but susceptible to amikacin and netilmicin, caused multiple infections in neonatal infants in a special care nursery. Nasal cultures revealed a high rate of carriage of the Gmr staphylococcus in infants without clinical infection. Segregating patients according to a modified cohort system and use of careful aseptic techniques led to apparent elimination of the Gmr strain. The resistance to aminoglycosides in this strain was mediated by an aminoglycoside 6'-N-acetyltransferase and a gentamicin phosphotransferase. Genetic determinants for these enzymes were borne on a circular covalently closed plasmid of approximately 11 megadaltons. These resistance determinants closely resemble those found in isolates of S. aureus that have caused nosocomial infections in patients in Europe.
