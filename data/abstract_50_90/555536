The data concerning annual usage in a general hospital and the frequency of resistant bacterial strains, isolated from patients with urinary tract's infection from 1975 to 1977 were collected and statistically processed. It was noticed that the year by year variation of resistance were mainly confined to E. coli and P. mirabilis. Increasing resistance with time was found for E. coli with Co-trimoxazole, P. mirabilis with Cephaloridin and Gentamicin, Proteus indole-positive with Rifampicin. Reducing resistance with time was found for E. coli with Colistin and Rifampicin, and Klebsiella-Enterobacter with Rifampicin. Trende with usage were found for E. coli and Klebsiella-Enterobacter with Rifampicin (decreasing) and P. mirabilis with Cephalorin (increasing). Naturally, none of the above trends imply cause and effect.
