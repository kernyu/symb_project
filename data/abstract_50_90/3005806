Two gentamicin resistant strains of Klebsiella were isolated at different times from patients with hospital acquired urinary tract infections. Both strains contained a conjugative 81-megadalton plasmid that encoded resistance to gentamicin, ampicillin, cephalothin and mercuric chloride. The plasmid conferred to Escherichia coli CSH26 the same pattern of resistance to eight aminoglycoside antibiotics and gave similar DNA fragments after restriction endonuclease digestion.
