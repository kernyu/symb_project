Nitrosoguanidine-induced mutations occur at higher frequencies at the replication region than at other nonreplicating regions of the chromosome. Cultures of Mycobacterium tuberculosis synchronized with phenylethanol were used to determine the order of replication for 10 genes controlling drug resistance. Use of M. tuberculosis provided a 10-h replication map with good resolution because of the slow rate of deoxyribonucleic acid replication. The direction of chromosome replication could not be determined, but this study indicated no pause between rounds of deoxyribonucleic acid replication in a rich medium.
