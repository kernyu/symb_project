Thirty-six mutants of fd, a virus that infects but does not kill Escherichia coli, were isolated; 35 mutants were categorized into six complementation groups. Abortive infection with mutants in genes 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6, but not in gene 2, produced a cessation of host cell growth, generally linked to low burst size and to the formation of aberrant intracytoplasmic membranous structures. The membranous structure was studied during infection with various phage and hosts. Appearance of the membranous structure was linked specifically to incomplete phage maturation at the cell membrane, rather than solely to the inhibition of host cell growth or to infection with mutant phage, since (i) in one host, cell growth was inhibited, but no membranous structure developed; and (ii) when antibody against virus was added to cells infected with wild-type phage, phage extrusion was inhibited, cell growth stopped, and the membranous structure once again developed.
