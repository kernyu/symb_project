Virus-nonproducer Raji cells, when induced to early antigen synthesis by 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate and sodium butyrate, showed an increase in DNA polymerase activity. This enzyme has the characteristics of a typical Epstein-Barr virus DNA polymerase with regard to chromatographical pattern and biological properties: it is eluted from DEAE-cellulose at 0.08 M NaCl, has a high salt resistance, is sensitive to phosphonoacetic acid and phosphonoformate, and shows a substrate preference for poly(dC)-oligo(dG12-18). The resistance of Epstein-Barr virus polymerase activity to aphidicolin is a property distinct from that of HSV DNA polymerase. Viral DNA polymerase activity increases in the absence of Epstein-Barr virus DNA replication, indicating that this enzyme is an early viral protein.
