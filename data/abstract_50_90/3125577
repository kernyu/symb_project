Third-generation cephalosporins have been considered for the treatment of systemic salmonelloses because of emerging resistance among Salmonella species to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Twelve patients with typhoid/paratyphoid fever, nine with nontyphoid salmonella bacteremia, and two with Salmonella meningitis were treated with cefotaxime; one leukemic patient with Salmonella dublin bacteremia received ceftizoxime. All infections were cured except for one in a patient with sickle cell anemia; this patient's illness recurred but was cured with a second course of cefotaxime followed by ceftriaxone. A review of the literature documented cures with cefotaxime in 50 of 61 patients with typhoid/paratyphoid fever, all of four with salmonella osteomyelitis, 12 of 14 with salmonella meningitis, and 44 of 49 with non-typhoid salmonella bacteremia. Ceftriaxone and cefoperazone cured, respectively, 23 of 25 and 32 of 33 patients with typhoid/paratyphoid fever. The relapse rates of typhoid fever treated with cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, and cefoperazone were 6%, 4%, and 0%, respectively. Cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, and cefoperazone are acceptable alternative antibiotics for the treatment of salmonelloses caused by multiresistant organisms.
