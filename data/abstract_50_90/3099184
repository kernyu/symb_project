The expression of Tc resistance gene derived from plasmid pBR322 has been studied in Bacillus subtilis cells where this alien gene is not usually expressed. Fragments of Bacillus subtilis chromosome were inserted into the Tc resistance gene promoter region of the hybrid plasmid pGG20 and the expression of this gene was registered. Plasmid pGG20 confers a constitutive mode of Tc resistance in Escherichia coli cells. In contrast, the inducibility of Tc resistance gene expression in Bacillus subtilis cells has been reported. Optimal concentration for the highest inducibility of Tc resistance by the antibiotic has been determined.
