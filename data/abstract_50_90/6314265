We have characterized hygromycin B and apramycin resistance genes from an E. coli plasmid. We have localized the coding and control regions of these genes by deletion of DNA fragments from plasmids containing the genes. It was found that polypeptides with apparent molecular weights of 33,000 and 31,500 daltons are encoded by the apramycin resistance gene and polypeptides with apparent molecular weights of 42,500 and 41,500 daltons are encoded by the hygromycin B resistance gene. DNA sequence analysis identified a typical promoter sequence upstream of the genes. Deletion of this promoter eliminated both resistance phenotypes, and hygromycin B resistance could be restored by substitution of a promoter from a foreign gene. The region known to be necessary for hygromycin B resistance contained an open reading frame large enough to encode the hygromycin B resistance gene product. This open reading frame was fused with the amino terminus of beta-galactosidase. This hybrid gene conferred hygromycin resistance to E. coli, and expression of resistance was under IPTG control.
