Temocillin (BRL 17421) a new penicillin, was compared with cefazolin against 20 strains of Klebsiella. The in vitro minimal bactericidal concentration of cefazolin was twice as active as that of temocillin. Serum bactericidal levels obtained in volunteers treated with temocillin were consistently higher than those levels reached after the administration of cefazolin at the 6-h sampling.
