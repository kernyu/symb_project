We studied 21 strains of amikacin-resistant Serratia marcescens from three different U.S. cities, Twenty of the 21 strains contained conjugative R plasmids mediating gentamicin and tobramycin resistance. Amikacin-resistant S. marcescens from two cities predominated in protracted outbreaks. Conversely, the amikacin-resistant Charleston strain (serotype 02/03:nonmotile) was isolated from only four patients during an outbreak of gentamicin- and tobramycin resistant, amikacin-susceptible S. marcescens (serotype O19:O17). Five different representative amikacin-resistant S. marcescens, each containing a single conjugative plasmid, elaborated a nontransferable aminoglycoside (6')-N-acetyltransferase [AAC(6')] with similar substrate profiles in addition to other transferable aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes. One amikacin-resistant S. marcescens cured of its plasmid and another naturally occurring plasmid-free amikacin-resistant S. marcescens elaborated only AAC(6')-1. These data support the concept of a chromosomal locus in S. marcescens for AAC(6')-1 which commonly coexists with plasmid-mediated genes for aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes.
