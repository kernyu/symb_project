During the month of February 1982 in an orthopedic department (37 patients admitted), episodes of diarrhoea occurred in 9 patients, one of these resulting in the death of one patient. From the stool cultures of the patients methicillin/gentamicin resistant S. aureus (MRGRSA) was isolated. The clinical, microbiological and epidemiological analysis demonstrated the staphylococcal origin of the enterocolitis. The statistical analysis brought to light a significant increase in the acquisition of the infection in relation to age, surgical intervention, catheter, ulcers and antibiotic therapy. The medical staff, colonized at hand and nose by the epidemic strain contributed probably to the transmission from person to person. Antimicrobial therapy with oral vancomycin of colonized patients and application of topical ointment (betadine) on personnel eliminated colonization with methicillin/gentamicin resistant S. aureus.
