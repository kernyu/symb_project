Lactic-acid bacteria (L. fermenti, L. acidophilus, L. delbruecki), when developing resistance to antibiotics, did not change their main biochemical, antagonistic properties and did not lose capacity for acid production. Only a decrease in their growth rate and a change in their sensitivity to the action of ultraviolet radiation were observed. Both initial and antibiotic-resistant strains were capable of taking on the mucous membrane of the large and small intestines in CBA mice.
