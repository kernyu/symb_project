Eimeria mivati was described as a new species of chicken coccidia in 1964 by Edgar and Seibold, but recently some British workers have relegated its status to that of a variety of Eimeria acervulina. Using strains supplied by Dr. Edgar, we have prepared lines of E. acervulina resistant to methyl benzoquate, sulfaquinoxaline and robenidine and a line of E. mivati resistant to methyl benzoquate. Genetic transfer of resistance between the various lines of E. acervulina to produce doubly-resistant coccidia has been demonstrated, but no such transfer could be obtained between E. mivati resistant to methyl benzoquate and the resistant lines of E. acervulina. Although some immunological relationship between E. acervulina and E. mivati has been demonstrated, we conclude that this failure of the 2 organisms to interbreed lends support to the status of E. mivati as a distinct species.
