A newly developed human immunoglobulin preparation for intravenous use, SM-4300, had been studied in the field of surgery. SM-4300 was administered to 2 patients with severe infection in the combined use with antibiotics. SM-4300 was considered to be a safe and effectively useful drug. One case with suspicious of septicaemia was excellent response to SM-4300, at a dosage of 2.5 g/day x 3, and another case with postoperative diffuse peritonitis was not effective at a dosage of 5.0 g/day x 1. No objective and subjective side effect and abnormal laboratory finding was observed in 2 cases.
