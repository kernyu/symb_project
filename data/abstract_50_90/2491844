The use of digitonin to permeabilize Trypanosoma cruzi plasma membrane enabled us to study Ca2+ transport and oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria in situ. Addition of Ca2+ to these preparations evoked a cycle of respiratory stimulation. Ca2+ uptake was partially inhibited by ruthenium red, almost totally inhibited by antimycin A, and stimulated by inorganic phosphate. Addition of carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone to digitonin-permeabilized T. cruzi epimastigotes under steady-state conditions was followed by Ca2+ release. Antimycin A- and carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazonein-sensitive Ca2+ uptake was also detected in digitonin-permeabilized epimastigotes. Accordingly, ATP stimulated Ca2+ uptake by preparations de-energized by oligomycin and antimycin A. In conclusion, in contrast to previous reports indicating that a Ca2+ transport system occurs only in mitochondria from vertebrate tissues, T. cruzi epimastigotes also possess a similar system. In addition, these protozoan mitochondria have an extremely high resistance to the deleterious effects of massive Ca2+ loads in comparison with most types of mammalian mitochondria.
