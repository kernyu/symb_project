Escherichia coli K12 strains containing the plasmid pBR322 often show varying contents of plasmid oligomers, in which the monomer units are arranged in tandem. When the concentration of the plasmid-selective antibiotic tetracycline in the medium becomes increased selection of cells containing largely higher oligomers occurs. The number of monomer units organized in the oligomers increases with tetracycline concentration. recA- mutants are unable to generate oligomers under the same conditions and show lower tetracycline resistance. This observations suggest a selective advantage of oligomer containing cells in the presence of tetracycline as a result of higher gene dosage. But E. coli cells transformed with monomers, dimers, trimers, as well as tetramers of pBR322 are characterized by roughly the same plasmid DNA content as well as plasmid coded beta-lactamase and resistance to tetracycline.
