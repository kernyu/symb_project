Because gram-negative bacteremia is increasing in frequency, it is important for physicians to suspect, carefully evaluate, and initiate early appropriate therapy. Identification of the probable source of bacteremia and a knowledge of the hospital microflora are helpful in guiding antibiotic selection. The mortality of gram-negative bacteremia tends to vary with the severity of the underlying disease and, accordingly, tends to be low in obstetrical patients. Prevention is the most effective method of controlling these infections and, therefore, care and discretion when employing invasive devices is essential. With the increasing incidence of these infections and the increased threat of antibiotic plasmid resistance, future infection control in high-risk patients by immunoprophylaxis may be necessary.
