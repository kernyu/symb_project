In Anadolu University Medical School, 55 Salmonella strains were isolated between Nov. 26, 1979 to Feb. 28, 1980 Out of these strains 49.1% were resistant to chloramphenicol, 14,5% to ampicillin and trimetoprium + sulphametoxasol, and 3.6% to tobramycine. All strains were sensitive to gentamycine and amikacine. The differences between the three groups; gentamycine, amikacine and tobramycine; ampicillin and trimetoprim + sulphamitaxasol; and chloramphenicol, were statistically significant.
