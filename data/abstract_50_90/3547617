Alterations in microbial ecology caused by the usage of aminoglycosides for therapy of human infections are due to their selective pressure favouring insensitive or resistant species or strains. There is a positive correlation between aminoglycoside consumption and the incidence of resistance to aminoglycosides. This correlation is, however, modified by measures of infection control. At the present time, the overall incidence of resistance to aminoglycosides does not show major changes. The ecological impacts of aminoglycoside consumption appear to be less significant as compared to other antibiotics due to factors specific for the aminoglycoside group.
