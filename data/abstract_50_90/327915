Sensitivity of 227 Proteus strains isolated from patients was studied comparatively using the agar-diffusion method (disks) and the method of serial dilutions. Marked differences in the numbers of the strains resistant to benzylpenicillin and chloramphenicol were found with the above methods. It was shown that the ingredients of Ploskirev's medium significantly (by 2.8--13.5 times) inhibited the antibacterial activity of streptomycin, neomycin, monomycin, kanamycin, ampicillin and nalidixic acid and had practically no effect on the activity of benzylpenicillin, chloramphenicol and furazolidone. The values of the MIC of the drugs used in the experiment with liquid media correlated with those obtained with Sabouro's medium, which provided recommendation of the latter for determination of Proteus sensitivity by the method of serial dilutions in the solid medium, Cultivation of Proteus at a temperature of 40 degrees C resulted in a decrease of the resistance to most of the drugs tested by (by 3--12.4 times).
