Resistance to 6-methylpurine and cycloheximide has been induced in both the micronucleate species Tetrahymena thermophila and the amicronucleate species T. pyriformis. Resistance follows only after mutagen treatment and vegetative growth. The frequencies with which resistant variants are induced and the independence of mutagenesis and selection are demonstrated. All evidence is consistent with the hypothesis that macronuclear subunits are assorting in both species during vegetative growth to produce new phenotypes among subclones.
