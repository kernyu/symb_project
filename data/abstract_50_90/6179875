Murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) induces rapid production of a partially pH 2-stable type 1 interferon, the serum level of which is controlled by non-H-2-linked host genes. The production of high, intermediate, and low levels of interferon was found in C3H/He, C57BL/10, and BALB/c mice, respectively, and the use of H-2 congenic mice on the BALB/c or C57BL/10 background showed that H-2-associated genes were not involved. Administration of large (up to 200,000 U) daily doses of partially purified type 1 (alpha plus beta) interferon failed to protect low-producer BALB/c or BALB.K strains from lethal infection. Treatment of the higher (C3H/He) or intermediate (C57BL/10) producer strains with anti-type 1 interferon antibody significantly reduced their resistance to the virus; however, such treatment had no effect on the low-producer BALB/c strain. The decreased resistance of anti-interferon-treated C3H/He mice was accompanied by a transient reduction in serum interferon titers, decreased activation of natural killer cells, a markedly enhanced viremia, and increased viral titers in the liver. These data strongly support a protective role of interferon in defense against MCMV in certain strains of mice. Furthermore, these data suggest that previous observations of a correlation of non-H-2-linked, genetically determined resistance to MCMV with activation of natural killer cells may have its basis in the genetic control of interferon induction by MCMV.
