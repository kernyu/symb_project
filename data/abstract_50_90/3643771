Quinolone antibiotics have been proposed as possible alternatives to vancomycin for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections. We investigated the activities of amifloxacin, ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, and vancomycin by time-kill kinetic studies. Antibiotic concentrations of 0, 1.0, and 4.0 times the MIC were used against four strains of gentamicin- and methicillin-resistant S. aureus. Staphylococci were plated onto ciprofloxacin-containing agar at all time points, in repeat time-kill kinetic studies. Macrobroth dilution MICs and MBCs were determined. Ciprofloxacin levels were measured by bioassay. Replica plating was performed from the original susceptible inoculum (MIC, 0.125 micrograms/ml) onto ciprofloxacin-supplemented agar. At 4.0 times the MIC, only with ciprofloxacin was there regrowth at 24 and 48 h. All four strains of staphylococci grew on agar supplemented with 1 microgram of ciprofloxacin per ml; three of four grew on agar supplemented with 2 micrograms of ciprofloxacin per ml. MICs and MBCs for these resistant clones ranged from 8 to 32 micrograms/ml. No degradation in activity or amount of ciprofloxacin could be detected in the bioassay. Replica-plated staphylococci grew on agar containing 1 microgram/ml but not higher concentrations of ciprofloxacin at 48 h. Amifloxacin and norfloxacin sustained bactericidal activity comparable to that of vancomycin. We conclude that heteroresistant subpopulations of gentamicin- and methicillin-resistant S. aureus can emerge under antibiotic selection pressure. Such resistant clones may then mutate in the presence of subinhibitory concentrations of antibiotic to higher levels of ciprofloxacin resistance.
