Stimulation of resistance to infection induced by the analogs of muramyl dipeptide (MDP) having substituted functions in the gamma-carboxyl group of D-isoglutamyl residue was examined in experimental Escherichia coli infections in mice. An MDP analog which is an efficient strengthener of resistance to infection, N alpha-MDP-N epsilon-stearoyllysine [MDP-Lys(L18)], was selected through the comparative assessment of a number of compounds in three categories: (i) gamma-alkylamides, (ii) gamma-esters, and (iii) N alpha-MDP-N epsilon-acyllysine derivatives. Furthermore, the antiinfectious activity of MDP-Lys(L18) was evaluated bacteriologically in comparison with that of MDP. The effect of MDP-Lys(L18) on the susceptibility of mice to infections with various species of microorganisms was studied. Protective activity was greatest against E. coli and staphylococcal infections, considerable against Pseudomonas and Candida infections, and least against Klebsiella infection. The effects of bacterial inoculum size and MDP treatment timing, dose, and route of administration on protective activity were studied. The efficacy of MDP-Lys(L18) in protection tests was demonstrated for all administration routes, even the oral. Its high potency was confirmed by the smaller influence of inoculum size and particularly small value of the minimum dosage required for inducing protective activity. A decrease in bacterial survival was observed in the blood and organs of mice treated with the analog and infected with E. coli. The following two useful effects were obtained: the synergistic effect of glycopeptide and chemotherapeutic agents and the stimulation of resistance to infection in animals immunocompromised by cyclophosphamide treatment.
