Glucuronidation of 1-naphthol was studied in mucosal cells isolated from the rat intestine. Glucuronidation was directly dependent on the supply of extracellular carbohydrates. Basal glucuronidation (ca. 0.3 nmoles/min X mg cell protein) was increased 2- to 3-fold by adding glucose or fructose to the incubation medium. Saturation of glucuronidation was achieved by adding 0.3 mM glucose, while saturation by fructose was not reached at concentrations below 2 mM. No carbohydrate reserves able to support glucuronidation appear to be present in intestinal cells, since no difference in glucuronidation was observed between cells prepared from fasted (18 or 42 h) and control rats. Glucuronidation was decreased by adding D-galactosamine to the incubation medium, but only when extracellular glucose was present. Various chemicals which are known to inhibit glucuronidation in hepatocytes (ethanol, diethyl ether, sorbitol) did not influence the glucuronidation of 1-naphthol in isolated intestinal cells. Only when ethanol was added to mucosal cells in the absence of extracellular glucose was a small decrease in glucuronidation observed.
