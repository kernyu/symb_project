The diazo antibiotic 6 diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine is transported into Escherichia coli using the general aromatic amino acid transport system and a specific phenylalanine transport system. Resistance to this antibiotic is the result of a decreased rate of transport of the antibiotic and also the result of a more rapid rate of efflux of the antibiotic from the cell.
