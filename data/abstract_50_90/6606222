The efficacy of nine oral antibiotics were analyzed by the agar dilution method against clinical isolates consisting of 87 beta-lactamase positive and negative Haemophilus influenzae and Branhamella catarrhalis strains and 30 Streptococcus pneumoniae strains. The following drugs were tested: cefaclor, cefalexin, cefadroxil, cefradin, phenoxymethylpenicillin, ampicillin, amoxycillin, erythromycin and doxycycline. Inoculations of 10(4) bacteria/plate were made with a Steers inoculator on Mueller-Hinton agar containing 5% blood. Cefaclor was more effective than the other cefalosporins against all H. influenzae and B. catarrhalis strains, regardless of their beta-lactamase production. Cefaclor and cefradin were more effective than cefalexin and cefadroxil against S. pneumoniae strains. Cefaclor was less effective than erythromycin against pneumococci, B. catarrhalis and beta-lactamase positive H. influenzae strains and equally effective against beta-lactamase negative H. influenzae strains. Cefaclor was less active than doxycycline against the B. catarrhalis and H. influenzae strains and showed similar efficacy as doxycycline against pneumococci.
