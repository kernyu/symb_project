The promoter region of the CaMV inclusion body protein gene was modified for use in chimeric gene fusions. The modified promoter was used to construct a selectable marker for plant transformation based on the Tn 5 kanamycin resistance gene. This chimeric selectable marker was introduced into plant cells using oncogenic and deoncogenized strains of Agrobacterium tumefaciens. Both types of transformation produced kanamycin-resistant cell lines. The resistant cell lines derived from the deoncogenized strains were used to regenerate shoots. A second type of selection based on the ability of octopine synthase to detoxify aminoethyl cysteine was also used to select transformants in both oncogenic and nononcogenic transformation.
