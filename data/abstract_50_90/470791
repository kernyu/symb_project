The aminoglycoside dibekacin, developed in Japan and now on the market in Germany, has been tested for its clinical and microbiological effectiveness on 45 patients with highly resistant germs. 41 of the 55 primary sensitive germs could be thus eliminated from the urine, 6 of the 11 being pseudomonas germs. The clinical results of 33 of the 45 patients were very good, only 4 of them were not convincing. The nephrotoxic side effects were noticeably slight. No evidence of damage to the VIIIth brain nerve was observed in these patients. The results were satisfactory considering the selection of problem patients in the test group. Dibekacin can be regarded with gentamicin as a first choice aminoglycoside.
