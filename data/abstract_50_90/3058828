The half time of disappearance of dapsone and monoacetyl dapsone and the acetylator phenotype of the leprosy patients who harboured dapsone sensitive and dapsone resistant M. leprae was assessed in 27 subjects. Sixteen patients were rapid acetylators, five were slow and six were intermediate acetylators. The mean T 1 1/2 lives of dapsone (30.26 +/- 11.0) and monoacetyl dapsone (31.11 +/- 12.0) were also studied in the above patients. The percentage of different acetylators in both resistant and sensitive groups were similar showing no correlation between the emergence of drug resistance and the phenotype of the patient. The mean time of disappearance of DDS and MAD in the different acetylators did not show significant difference. The ratios of MAD/DDS in an individual at 3, 6 or 24 hours after the dose were similar. The mean T 1 1/2 lives of DDS and MAD in resistant and sensitive patients also showed no difference. Neither T 1 1/2 lives of DDS or MAD nor the acetylator phenotype seem to influence the emergence of dapsone resistance.
