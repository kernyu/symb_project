A total of 78 strains of Haemophilus vaginalis were examined for 104 features. All strains fermented dextrin, maltose, and starch. Additionally, more than 90% of the strains fermented galactose, glucose, and ribose. Arbutin, cellobiose, melibiose, rhamnose, and salicin were not fermented by any of these strains. None of the strains acidified any of 14 alcohols or alkalinized any of 25 organic salts and amides. More than 90% of the strains hemolyzed human blood agar and hydrolyzed hippurate. No strain hemolyzed sheep blood agar. A recommendation is included for those minimal features that best differentiate H. vaginalis from other oxidase- and catalase-negative, gram-negative organisms.
