Four cases of multivesicular hepatic hydatidosis are reported. Two of them were affected by exogenous growth. All patients had undergone a long-term treatment with mebendazole at the usual doses. We are contrasting our experience in the use of such drug and the previous reports by other authors. In our opinion, as mebendazole acts on the cyst in a double way (both inhibiting glucose uptake by the larva and modifying the structure of the cyst membranes) ir induces the cyst multivesiculation which is a sign of suffering or resistance of the parasite. Despite the fact that previous reports, and also one of the cases reported by us, point to a favourable evolution of the hepatic hydatidosis after treatment with Mebendazole, the possibility that the multivesicular cyst-with a more spreading growth and a surgical treatment which is occasionally more difficult, may be induced by that drug would perhaps discourage its use.
