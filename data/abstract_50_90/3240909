Adherence of three strains of group A streptococci and their fosfomycin-resistant mutants to HEp-2 tissue culture cells was compared with some cell-surface characteristics, i.e. ultrastructure and hydrophobicity. Among Fosr mutants, both well-adhering and weakly adhering mutants were found. Clonal analysis of the mutants proved their greater stability in the adherence. Well-adhering parent strains of streptococci and Fosr mutants exhibited surface fibrillae in contrast to weakly adhering Fosr mutants which were devoid of fibrillae or contined fibrillae of lower electron density. Decrease of adherence of Fosr mutants of two strains was accompanied by a decrease of their hydrophobicity.
