A patient with bacteremia caused by vancomycin-resistant Streptococcus sanguis II is presented. This rare occurrence suggests that vancomycin may not be a completely reliable antibiotic in the treatment of infections due to viridans species of the genus Streptococcus. Gram-positive isolates from blood and otherwise sterile body fluids should be tested for susceptibility to vancomycin.
