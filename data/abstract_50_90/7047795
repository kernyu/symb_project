In vitro activities of antibacterial agents against E. coli, Klebsiella, Citrobacter and Proteus which were isolated from patients urinary tract infections at 8 hospitals in Japan, were investigated by agar dilution method from July to October in 1979. The summarized results are as follows. 1. Among oral antibacterial agents, MPC and PPA have showed potent antibacterial activities against E. coli and Klebsiella. Among parenteral antibiotics, CTM was the most active against E. coli and Klebsiella. However, ABPC-resistant E. coli and Klebsiella have appeared to occupy about 40% and 96% of bacteria isolated from urinary tract infections, respectively. 2. In vitro activities of antibacterial agents against Proteus and Citrobacter showed not so potent. 3. Causative organisms in female patients with simple urinary tract infections were mainly E. coli and Klebsiella. 4. Among oral antibacterial agents, PPA have shown similar antimicrobial activities against E. coli isolated from simple and complicated urinary tract infections. ABPC and MPC have been influenced in some degree by these factors. However, parenteral antibiotics are not influenced by these factors. On the other hand, in vitro activities of antibacterial agents against Klebsiella isolated from simple and complicated urinary tract infections were similar.
