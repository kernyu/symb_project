A previous study indicated that the API 230E system can identify coagulase-negative Staphylococcus species. A study was devised to evaluate the use of the API 20E system for this purpose. Because of the current interest in Staphylococcus saprophyticus the relationship of the API 20E results to novobiocin susceptibility was also examined. One hundred forty-nine isolates of coagulase-negative staphylococci from urine cultures were tested with the API 20E system. The identification of 49 isolates was confirmed by Kloos and Schleifer method. We found that the routine API 20E system did not provide more information than novobiocin susceptibility studies alone, and that there was good but not absolute correlation between novobiocin resistance and identification of S. saprophyticus.
