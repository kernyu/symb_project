Mutants with various levels of resistance to streptothricin were isolated from Escherichia coli K12, strain A19 after mutagenesis with N-methyl-N-nitro-N-nitroso-guanidine and ethylmethane-sulfonate. Nourseothricin, a mixture of streptothricin F and D was the selection agent. Spontaneous resistant mutants could not be found. The streptothricin-resistant mutant E. coli A19 Stcr 2/2/1 shows cross-resistance to some of the aminoglycoside antibiotics investigated, but no cross-resistance to chloramphenicol and chlortetracyclin. These results indicate similar mechanisms of action of streptothricin and aminoglycoside antibiotics.
