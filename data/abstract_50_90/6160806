It was shown for the first time that isoprinosine has an antiviral effect in treatment of experimental forest-spring encephalitis. The combined use of isoprinosine with mouse interferon in treatment of the infected albino mice potentiated antiviral effect as compared to the effect of substances used alone. In addition, the combined use of isoprinosine and interferon inductor in minimum nontoxic amounts resulted in a 4--8 fold increase in the titers of the serum interferon and a statistically significant increase in the mouse resistance to the viral infection. It was found that the efficacy of the combined use of isoprinosine and mouse interferon or interferon inductor increased, when the interval between the drug administrations was prolonged up to 24 hours. The maximum effect providing 75 per cent protection of the animals from the viral infection and an increase in the average life span of the mice from 7.9 to 17.4 days was observed with the combined use of isoprinosine and interferon inductor.
