The antibacterial activity of micronomicin (MCR) was studied comparatively with that of AMK, GM, CMZ and CFX against 346 strains of E. coli, K. pneumoniae, S. marcescens, P. mirabilis, P. rettgeri, P. vulgaris, M. morganii, E. cloacae, P. aeruginosa, S. aureus and S. epidermidis isolated from patients with urinary tract infections on a nation-wide scale from January to July, 1981. MCR was as high as GM in antibacterial activity against all of strains tested, especially very potent against E. coli and P. mirabilis. On the other hand, AMK showed a tendency to be a little lower in antibacterial activity than MCR and GM, CMZ and CFX were weaker in antibacterial activity against the strains tested in this study than MCR, AMK and GM.
