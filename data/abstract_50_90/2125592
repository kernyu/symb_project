The sporicidal efficacy of glutaraldehyde (2% w/v) was investigated under various conditions. Numerous factors influenced its activity: method of spore production, inherent spore resistance characteristics, alkalination, storage time and storage temperature. The sporicidal action of 2% alkaline glutaraldehyde at room temperature was compared with that of other aldehydes and commercially available formulations. Cidex (glutaraldehyde) and Sporicidin (glutaraldehyde + phenol full strength) were the most effective, followed by 8% (w/v) formaldehyde and 10% (v/v) Gigasept, a formaldehyde-containing product. Five per cent (v/v) Gigasept and 10% (w/v) glyoxal also had good sporicidal activity, though that of Sporicidin (1:16) was poor. No activity was observed with 10% (w/v) butyraldehyde.
