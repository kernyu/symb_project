The antimalarial activities of amodiaquine, the desethyl metabolite of amodiaquine, chloroquine, and mefloquine were evaluated against 35 field isolates of Plasmodium falciparum collected from eastern Thailand, October-December 1985, to define patterns of cross-resistance among these compounds. The assay system was based on the in vitro inhibition of schizont maturation. The parasites were generally sensitive to mefloquine (mean 50%-inhibitory concentrations = 9.98 nM) and highly resistant to chloroquine (IC50 = 313 nM). The mean in vitro activity of desethylamodiaquine (67.5 nM) was approximately 3.5 times lower than that of amodiaquine (18.2 nM). There was a significant rank-order correlation between the IC50S of desethylamodiaquine and chloroquine, but not between amodiaquine and chloroquine, which suggests that the apparent cross-resistance between chloroquine and amodiaquine observed in clinical studies may be more closely related to the cross-resistance between chloroquine and the metabolite rather than between chloroquine and the parent compound. Isolates with IC50 values of amodiaquine greater than 20 nM demonstrated a high degree of correlation with values of desethylamodiaquine; however, it was not possible to accurately predict the sensitivity to desethylamodiaquine of isolates which had IC50 values of amodiaquine of less than 20 nM.
