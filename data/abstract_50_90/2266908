The study was performed in the area of distribution of tropical malaria resistant to 4-aminoquinolines (Vietnam) on 30 patients receiving lariam (mefloquine). The results were compared to the standard therapy with quinine and fansidar. They indicate a high efficacy of and a good tolerance to the drug tested. The use of lariam leads to a more rapid (as compared to the standard treatment) elimination of parasitemia and complete eradication of the disease relapses. The findings make it possible to recommend lariam for the prevention and treatment of tropical malaria.
