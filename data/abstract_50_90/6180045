The in vitro activity of the fibrous mineral wollastonite (CaSiO3) on the interferon system was investigated. Wollastonite enhanced the induction of interferon by influenza virus in mammalian (LLC-MK2) cell monolayers but the mineral per se did not induce interferon. The magnitude of enhanced interferon induction was dependent on mineral concentration, particle size, and its time and sequence of addition onto cell monolayers. A "synergistic effect" on viral induction of interferon was noted when cell cultures were interferon-primed and then treated with wollastonite. Interferon yields were significantly higher than those obtained by the use of either the primer or wollastonite alone. That influenza virus multiplied in wollastonite-treated cells to a level that was sevenfold less than that in normal cells was associated with increased interferon production. The ability of interferon to confer antiviral cellular resistance was not impaired by wollastonite. The findings of this study suggest that the incorporation of wollastonite in appropriate interferon inducer-host cell systems may be useful for augmenting interferon production.
