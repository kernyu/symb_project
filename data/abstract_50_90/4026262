The dimorphic fungus Mucor racemosus exhibited a single-step, inducible resistance to cycloheximide, trichodermin, and amphotericin B. Cells adapted to inhibitory levels of the antibiotics after 12 to 40 h. The adaptation involved all the cells in the population and was not the result of the selection of resistant mutants. Adaptation to one drug provided cross resistance to other, dissimilar drugs. Resistance was lost within several generations of growth in the absence of the inhibitors.
