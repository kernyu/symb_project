In 20 patients with an acute exacerbation of chronic respiratory tract infection the effectiveness of oral erythromicin succinate 3 X 500 mg daily has been tested. The duration of treatment was 10 days in all cases. The criteria of success, in addition to the clinical findings, were the results of bacteriological investigations and assessment of the appearance of the sputum. In all patients sputum and serum concentrations or erythromicin were determined. All pathogens isolated from the sputum of the patients were erythromicin-sensitive. One instance of development of resistance was observed. The drug was well tolerated.
