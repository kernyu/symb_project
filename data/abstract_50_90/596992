Candida tropicalis protoplasts obtained by snail enzyme treatment were induced to fuse by the use of polyethylene-glycol. Heterokaryons formed by two auxotrophic strains were selected by complementation on minimal medium. These heterokaryons were unstable and readily dissociated into their nuclear components. Under appropriate conditions, the parental nuclei of an heterokaryon fused. The homokaryon so obtained was unstable and segregated into various types of auxotrophic and prototrophic recombinants.
