The 7.1-megadalton transposon Tn1721 codes for inducible tetracycline resistance (Tcr). The transposable element consists of a "minor transposon" (3.6 megadaltons) encoding functions required for transposition and a "tet region" (3.5 megadaltons) encoding resistance. Multiple tandem repeats of the tet region can be generated by recA-dependent gene amplification. This feature of Tn1721 has been used to analyze the relationship between gene dosage and Tcr. Derivatives of plasmid R388:Tn1721 containing from one to nine copies of the tet region were isolated and separately transformed into recA host cells, where they are stably maintained. The results of the study of Tcr in these strains were as follows: (i) the uninduced, "basal" level of Tcr was linearly related to gene dosage between 4 and 36 copies of tet per chromosome equivalent; (ii) the underlying mechanism could not be attributed to reduced accumulation of the drug; and (iii) induction with tetracycline elicited a four- to fivefold reduction in drug accumulation, independent of the gene dosage.
