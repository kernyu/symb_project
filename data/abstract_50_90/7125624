This report describes an activity range index derived from the minimal bactericidal and antibiotic concentrations of four aminoglycosides against four representatives of clinically important gram-negative bacilli. The ranking orders of in vitro activity differed from those using the minimal bactericidal concentration or the minimal antibiotic concentration as the sole criterion.
