Spectinomycin and tetracycline are alternative drugs to penicillin in the treatment of gonorrhea. To compare the efficacy of these agents and their propensity to select resistant gonococci, we treated 4043 patients randomly with either 2 or 4 g of spectinomycin once or 9 g of oral tetracycline for four days. Minimum cure rate for anogenital gonorrhea was 94 per cent with either drug. Oropharyngeal infection responded poorly to spectinomycin in men, with failure of therapy in six of 11. Postgonococcal urethritis in men was less common after tetracycline than after spectinomycin (P less than 0.005). Spectinomycin failure was not related to drug resistance. Tetracycline failure correlated with resistance (P less than 0.0002); one fifth of the isolates resistant to 1.0 mug per milliter of tetracycline were not eradicated. For several reasons, including the appearance of beta-lactamase-producing gonococci, it is no longer clear that penicillin G is the "drug of choice" for gonorrhea. Spectinomycin and tetracycline are equally acceptable alternatives, each with distinct advantages and disadvantages.
