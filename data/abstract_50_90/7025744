The chemotherapy of malaria is incomplete without taking into consideration the widespread presence of chloroquine resistant falciparum malaria necessitating the use of a combination of antimalarials in order to effect a radical cure. Fortunately, there has been no evidence of chloroquine resistance thus far with P vivax and P malariae. Chloroquine resistant falciparum strains are present in about 85% of patients suffering from falciparum malaria but fortunately over 90 percent of the resistant cases only show a mild degree of resistance of the RI (delayed) type which in the majority of cases responds to larger doses of chloroquine over and above the amount administered in the standard three days regime. A combination of antimalarials is necessary in order to effect a radical cure in chloroquine resistant falciparum malaria. Vivax malaria and malaria due to P malariae best respond to sequential therapy with chloroquine and primaquine.
