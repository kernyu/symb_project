During a 1-year period resistance to macrolides and lincosamides among staphylococci in a general hospital was studied. The macrolide-lincosamide resistance phenotype was found in 36.7% of coagulase-negative and in 3.7% of coagulase-positive species. Isolates showing this phenotype were more abundant from indwelling artificial devices, blood, respiratory tract and sterile fluids. The surgery and intensive care units of the hospital provided the highest proportion of such strains. Methicillin resistance was present in 13.9% of the staphylococci but no relationship between methicillin and macrolide-lincosamide resistance was observed.
