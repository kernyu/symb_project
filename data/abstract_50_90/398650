1. We suggest a combination of analgesic and antipyretic medicaments in medical treatments with antibiotics. Thus, the antibiotic is increased and microorganisms, resistant to antibiotics, are converted into sensitive forms. 2. The results of the in vitro used method (diffusion plate test) are in accordance with the results obtained using these combinations in therapy. 3. This method should not be applied to strains that are sufficiently sensitive to antibiotics, since the results would be contrary to the afore mentioned. 4. The effects of a combination are additionally synergistic in the case of strains originally sensitive. 5. This method offers great possibilities for multiplying treatments with antibiotics. We recommend to give standardized combinations of antibiotics with analgesic and antipyretic medicaments per os.
