Interferons have been recognized to have potent in vitro antiproliferative activities in mouse and human systems. To further investigate the kinetics of development of interferons' antiproliferative activities, mouse B-16 melanoma cells were treated with MuIFN-alpha, MuIFN-beta or MuIFN-gamma for various initial periods of time during an 8 day cloning assay. With MuIFN-alpha and MuIFN-beta treatments, maximal expression of antiproliferative activity was attained with 2 to 4 days of interferon treatment. In contrast, with MuIFN-gamma treatment, expression of antiproliferative activity increased with progressively longer periods of time of MuIFN-gamma treatment. These results suggested that B-16 melanoma cells were initially sensitive to all three of the interferons but rapidly became resistant to MuIFN-alpha and MuIFN-beta after 2 to 4 days of treatment. This suggestion was confirmed by cell growth kinetics experiments. The cells which were resistant to the antiproliferative activity of the MuIFN-alpha remained sensitive to the antiviral activity of MuIFN-alpha, suggesting that MuIFN-alpha and MuIFN-beta regulate their antiviral and antiproliferative responses via different mechanisms. The cells which were resistant to the antiproliferative activities of MuIFN-alpha and MuIFN-beta remained sensitive to MuIFN-gamma, suggesting that they were not generally resistant to antiproliferative effects. The cells which were resistant to the antiproliferative activities of the interferons gradually lost their resistance with a half-life of 11 days when they were cultured in the absence of interferons. The differential antiproliferative actions of alpha, beta and gamma interferons observed with murine B-16 melanoma were confirmed in the human system with G-361 melanoma cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
