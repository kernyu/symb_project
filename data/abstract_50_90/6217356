The 868 strains of S. aureus were isolated at the Department of Pediatrics, Third Hospital and Aoto Hospital, The Jikei University, School of Medicine and the Kanagawa Prefectural Nursing and Hygienic School Hospital during 6 months from May to October in 1981. From them 66 strains not sensitive to CEZ were selected by a 3-concentration disk method. A total number of 54 strains except for 12 isolated from the same infant patient was examined for their MIC's for 6 drugs, CMZ, CEZ, CTM, CXM, MCIPC and GM. Moreover, phage typing and beta-lactamase activity determination were carried out in them. 1. Antibacterial activity Sixty-six (7.6) of 868 strains were not sensitive to CEZ. The MIC's of CMZ against these resistant strains were between 1.56 and 50 micrograms/ml with a peak between 3.13 and 6.25 micrograms/ml when the 10(5) cells/ml bacterial suspension were inoculated. CMZ was superior in antibacterial activity to CEZ and CXM by about 4 degrees and to CTM by about 3 degrees. MCIPC and GM has higher antibacterial activity against a few strains than CMZ. However, the number of strains with MIC higher than or equal to 50 micrograms/ml was 17 for MCIPC and 40 for GM, but only 2 for CMZ. Thus, the former 2 drugs were far inferior to the latter one. 2. Phage type (1) Nineteen strains (35.2%) had MIC's for CEZ greater than 50 micrograms/ml and CMZ less than 6.25 micrograms/ml. Seventeen of them belonged to the nontypable. (2) Fourteen (25.9%) had MIC's for CEZ greater than 100 micrograms/ml. Of them 9 were allocated to the group III, 3 to the mixed (I + II + III, I + III) group and 2 to the nontypable. (3) Of 20 strains (37.0%) which had MIC's for CEZ greater than 100 micrograms/ml and CMZ less than 6.25 micrograms/ml 5 belonged to the group I, 3 to the group III and 12 to the nontypable. (4) Five strains classified into the group I were all isolated at the Kanagawa Perfectural Nursing and Hygienic School Hospital. (5) Eleven of 15 strains belonging to the group III were isolated at the Third Hospital, The Jikei University, School of Medicine. (6) Seventeen of 21 strains isolated at the Aoto Hospital, The Jikei University, School of Medicine belonged to the nontypable. (7) Phage type was considered to be influenced by difference in areas, infection within hospitals, etc., 3. beta-Lactamase activity beta-Lactamase activity was demonstrated at levels between 0.07 and 3.26 mumol/min/mg in all 54 strains. There was no correlation between MIC for CEZ or CEZ and beta-lactamase activity. It was suggested that beta-lactamase might not contribute to mechanism of resistance of S. aureus to each drug examined.
