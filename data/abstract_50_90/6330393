Susceptibilities of 372 strains of bacteria to cefotaxime (CTX) were determined based on the inhibition zone diameter obtained by the single-disc method. Four categories were assessed. Susceptibility of clinical isolated to CTX and 3 other antibiotics. Against most strains, CTX showed higher antibacterial activity than other drugs in the low concentration, especially for S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, S. agalactiae, E. coli and P. morganii. Susceptibility of strains isolated from different clinical materials. CTX showed the highest antibacterial activity against most strains isolated from pus, blood and cerebrospinal fluid and showed higher activity against strains isolated from other materials, too. Susceptibility of clinical isolates in 7 different fields. CTX was shown to have uniformly higher antibacterial activity than other drugs against isolates from such fields as internal medicine, pediatrics, surgery, urology, obstetrics & gynecology, dermatology and otorhinolaryngology. CTX showed the highest antibacterial activity in dermatology. Susceptibility of all clinical isolates. CTX showed the highest antibacterial activity against isolated pathogenic 352 strains (except for P. aeruginosa of 20 strains).
