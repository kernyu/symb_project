S. griseus Kr. is a commercial strain producing grisin, an antibiotic of the streptothricin group used as a feed additive. It was shown earlier that genetic instability of the strain was very high which was evident from a high frequency of nonreverting Grn- Grns mutants. With densitographic analysis of chromosomal DNA electrophoregrams and DNA-DNA hybridization it was revealed that the molecular basis of the genetic instability of the S. griseus strain was deletion of a DNA fragment about 20 kb in size containing a grisin resistance gene. The resistance gene designated as gsr was cloned to S. lividans TK 64 within the plasmid vector pIJ699. The restriction map of a cloned DNA fragment with a gsr gene was constructed and its similarity to that of a nat gene resistant to norseothricin, another streptothricin was observed. Introduction of a gsr gene within the multicopy plasmid pIJ699 into S. griseus 212, a highly productive strain synthesiing the antibiotic, led to an increase in its resistance and productivity. Proceeding from the preliminary data on possible linkage of a gsr gene and grisin biosynthesis genes, it appeared possible to use the cloned gene as a molecular probe in cloning the biosynthesis genes.
