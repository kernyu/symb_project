The authors studied 2287 strains of pathogenic enteric bacteria, i.e. Shigella, enteropathogenic Escherichia and Salmonella freshly isolated from children with respect to their sensitivity to the most widely used antibiotics, i.e. levomycetin, tetracycline, streptomycin, monomycin, neomycin, kanamycin and erythromycin. Low sensitivity of these strains to the above antibiotics and their combinations was observed. In the treatment of children of this group it is necessary to take into account multiple antibiotic sensitivity of the isolates of the enteropathogenic bacteria.
