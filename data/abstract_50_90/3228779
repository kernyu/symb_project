A 29-year-old woman who had successfully used extended-wear soft contact lens for 7 years was found to have a corneal ulcer due to Mycobacterium chelonei. Unique to this presentation was the lack of a history of severe corneal trauma, prior surgery or immunocompromised tissue. Despite in-vitro resistance of the organism to amikacin sulfate, topical therapy with this antibiotic led to a complete cure without the need for surgical intervention.
