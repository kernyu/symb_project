Analysis of sterols of Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutants N3, N15, N26, and N3H, defective in sterol biosynthesis, was performed. Strains N3, N15, and N26 were isolated from their mother strain, M10, by screening with nystatin (Nagai et al. (1980) Mie Med. J. 30, 215-224), and strain N3H was isolated from N3 as a doubly-mutated strain. The main sterols of N3, N15, N26, and N3H were ergosta-7,22-dienol, ergost-8-enol, cholesta-5,7,24-trienol, and ergosta-7,22,24(28)-trienol, respectively. The former three strains were characterized as defective in delta 5-desaturation, delta 8--delta 7 isomerization, and C-24 transmethylation. Strain N3H was found to be defective in delta 5-desaturation as well as in delta 24(28)-reduction. However, the defect of N26 and N3H was suggested to be leaky, since small amounts of ergosterol and ergosta-7,22-dienol were found in these mutants, respectively. In N15, an accumulation (2% in total sterols) of the compound likely to be hydroxylated sterol was found. By aerobic adaptation of these strains, the accumulation of these strains, the accumulations of ergosta-7,22-dienol (22 mg/g dry cells), ergosta-7,22,24(28)-trienol (24 mg), ergosta-8,24(28)-dienol (18 mg), and cholesta-8,24-dienol (22 mg) reached a maximum in N3, N3H, N15, and N26 after 20, 20, 30, and 30 h, respectively. These strains appear to be useful for making 14C-labeled and non-labeled preparations of the above sterols.
