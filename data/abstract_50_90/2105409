This study evaluated whether formaldehyde, at concentrations similar to those found in the indoor environment, could produce adverse effects on the lower airway of 15 asthmatic persons with documented bronchial hyperresponsiveness who were exposed for 90 min in a climate chamber to clean air containing formaldehyde vapor at levels of 0.85 mg/m3, 0.12 mg/m3, and 0.008 mg/m3. No significant changes in forced expiratory volume in 1 sec (FEV1), airway resistance (Raw), specific airway resistance (SRaw), and flow-volume curves could be detected during formaldehyde exposure. Furthermore, histamine challenge tests performed immediately after formaldehyde exposure showed no evidence of changes in bronchial reactivity. No late reactions were registered during the first 14-16 hr after exposure. The results suggest that residential levels of formaldehyde are of minor importance in the emergence of pulmonary symptoms. Discrepancies between the present study and previous data may be due to differences in environmental conditions.
