A computer analysis of 422 sheets of data from antibiograms performed on 146 patients in a resuscitation unit of multipurpose type, was performed. The study comprises the investigation of the nature of the isolated bacteria and the resistance of the organisms to antibiotics alone or in combinations. The results obtained show on the one hand, that there is a development over time of resistance to antibiotics and a change in the nature of the bacteria, and on the other, that a precise knowledge of the bacteriological data concerning a given department enables the intiation of treatment before having the antibiogram results with an increased chance of efficacy. The importance of such a study is controversial.
