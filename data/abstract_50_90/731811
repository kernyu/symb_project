Novel bacterial structures have been demonstrated in lysed blood filtrates placed in special culture media from patients with idiopathic hematuria. These structures converted rapidly to gram-positive coccal (streptococcal and staphylococcal-like), coccobacillary and filamentous, bacterial forms in vitro from 96 per cent of the patients studied. Blood cultured conventionally yielded negative findings. Although structures (dense bodies) were demonstrated in normal control blood specimens (albeit in lesser numbers) few converted to classical bacteria in vitro (7 per cent). Erythromycin therapy appeared to correlate with disappearance of hematuria and inability to revert rapidly the variant forms to classical bacteria in vitro. It is suggested that continual bombardment of the blood by bacteria entering from the mouth or other sites may lead to the development of variant bacterial parasitism. In an effort to survive the deleterious host effects the organisms may convert to persisting osmotically stable variant bacterial forms (dense bodies). Development of a disease state may be conditioned by some existing or developing abnormality in the host (immunologic, physiologic and/or biochemical). Furthermore, changes (genetic?) that might take place in the organisms per se during their transition to variant forms and adaptation to life in vivo may not allow certain host environments to adapt to these new forms, possibly leading to a pathogenetic role in renal diseases whose etiologies have long been enigmas.
