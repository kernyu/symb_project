The mouse neuroblastoma cell (N-18 clone) was used as a model for a taste cell. The N-18 cell was found to be reversibly depolarized by various bitter substances. The minimum concentrations of bitter substances which induced depolarization (threshold concentration) varied greatly with the type of the substance. There was a good correlation between the threshold concentrations for various bitter substances in the N-18 cell and those in the human taste responses. The input membrane resistance was little changed during the depolarization induced by the bitter substances. Replacement of Na+ and Cl- with impermeable ions had practically no effect on the depolarization response to the bitter substances and reduction of calcium concentration from 1.8 to 0.2 mM led to a slight increase in the responses. It was suggested that the depolarization of the N-18 cell by bitter substances mainly stems from changes in the phase-boundary potential at the outer surface of the cell.
