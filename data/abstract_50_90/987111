Thirty five strains of Staphylococcus epidermidis were tested for resistance to prenicillin G, erythomycin, metallic ions Zn, As3, As5, Cd, Hg, Pb and activity of beta-lactamase. These studies have shown that the majority of tested staphylococci were resistant to penicillin G, erythromycin, and produced beta-lactamase. No correlation between the activity of beta-lactamase and the resistance to metallic ions has been shown.
