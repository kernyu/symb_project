We examined 741 urinary tract isolates of the Morganella-Proteus-Providencia group, including the recently defined species Proteus penneri, for susceptibilities to aminoglycosides, semisynthetic penicillins, and cephalosporins. The data emphasize the importance of identification to the species level on the basis of marked species differences in patterns of susceptibility.
