The control strategies usually recommended in Africa south of the Sahara have not been followed by a lasting decline in the endemic level of the disease in the rural environment. The set-backs of the eradication period have revealed the need to redefine control objectives and strategies adapted to each type of malaria. Systematic chemotherapy for attacks of fever is a strategy that can be proposed in all circumstances; it avoids mortality from malaria; it can be carried out in the field on a country scale. The other means of control, directed against the parasites and the vectors, may be used depending of the specific situation in each country and on each type of malaria. Malaria control has to be integrated into the basic health system of each country, and we need to improve health education and develop primary health care. We must continue with our efforts to develop new antimalarial drugs, insecticides and vaccines; urgent steps must be taken to train malariologists capable of adapting the new techniques to the actual situation in the field. It is by associating socioeconomic development with the control means as a whole that we shall be able to control the various types of malaria and to reach out towards the objective of health for all by the year 2000.
