TFT is an effective selective agent for TK-deficient mutants of L5178Y TK+/- -3.7.2C mouse lymphoma cells. Mutants can be classified by colony size into small colonies (many of which show readily observable chromosome abnormalities associated with chromosome 11--the location of the TK gene) and large colonies (which may represent events affecting only the expression of the TK gene). The precise nature of the induced damage causing the loss of the TK-enzyme activity for both mutant type is not known and is currently under investigation. The hypomethylating agent 5-azacytidine can be utilized to investigate the possibility that mutants might be the result of a suppressed rather than an altered TK gene. Mutant cell lines are treated with 5-azacytidine and then evaluated for re-expression of the TK enzyme as measured by resistance to THMG. In these studies, 11 mutants have been evaluated. None of the 11, including 10 small-colony mutants (6 with chromosome 11 translocations) and 1 large-colony mutant, show a high conversion to TK competency following 5-azacytidine treatment.
