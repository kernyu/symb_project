Recent studies have resulted in the proposal of a new species, Aeromonas schubertii (mannitol, sucrose, and indole negative), formerly termed Enteric Group 501, on the basis of the study of seven strains isolated from the southeastern and southwestern United States and Puerto Rico. We have isolated two phenotypically similar A. schubertii strains from infected human wounds sustained in the Chesapeake Bay area. Their identification was confirmed by DNA-DNA hybridization to the Centers for Disease Control definition strain 2446-81 (ATCC 43700) for group 12. The strains were further examined for the presence of virulence-associated markers: hemolysin, hemagglutinins, cytotoxin production, agglutination in acriflavine, resistance to normal human serum, and autoagglutination phenotype. Both strains were positive for hemolysin by the plate assay, cytotoxin production at 1:10, and DNase and protease. They were resistant to human serum and negative for acriflavine agglutination, and only one of the strains was autoagglutination positive. Both strains were negative for cell-free hemolysin, hemagglutinins, pectinase, and chitinase. These isolations of A. schubertii further extend its previously described geographic distribution and reinforce its role as a primary causative agent of cellulitis with possible increased antimicrobial resistance.
