A patient with Philadelphia-chromosome positive chronic myelogenous leukemia developed interferon antibodies on treatment with recombinant interferon alpha-2b. Clinically this event corresponded with progressive disease. No cross-reactivity of antibodies with human leukocyte interferon was found by Western blot. Treatment was switched to human leukocyte interferon with an obvious clinical effect: WBC was reduced and platelet count stabilized, but the effect was transient and no hematologic remission was achieved. Human leukocyte interferon may be an alternative in CML-patients with neutralizing antibodies to recombinant interferon alpha.
