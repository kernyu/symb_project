Resistance of fibrillar proteins from large arteria wall, fixed with formaldehyde to the effect of various proteases was studied. Fixation of these proteins using 4% formaldehyde within 14 days enabled to increase distinctly their resistance to the effect of specific and unspecific proteases. Separation of glycosaminoglycans resulted in a decrease of collagen structure resistance to influence of collagenase.
