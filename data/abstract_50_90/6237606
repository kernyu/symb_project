Flucloxacillin, fosfomycin, fusidic acid, teichomycin, and vancomycin were tested against 50 clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus by a broth macrodilution technique. Teichomycin had a narrow range of activity, similar to that of vancomycin (0.5 to 2.0 micrograms/ml). Fusidic acid had the lowest range of inhibitory activity, with 50 and 90% MICs of 0.19 and 0.35 micrograms/ml, respectively. Flucloxacillin and fosfomycin showed less activity, with MICs up to 32 micrograms/ml.
