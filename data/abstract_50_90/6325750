Forty-one male patients with gonorrheal urethritis were treated with ceftizoxime (CZX) administered concomitantly probenecid at the urological ward of Tokyo Metropolitan Taito Hospital during the period from October, 1982 to February, 1983, and clinically evaluated. Eighty strains of Neisseria gonorrhoeae isolated from the clinical specimens of these patients were bacteriologically studied. Of the 80 strains, 12(15%) were PPNG strains and the other 68 strains were non-PPNG strains. MICs of PCG to the 12 PPNG strains were 3.13 - 25 micrograms/ml and to the 68 non-PPNG strains were 0.0122 - 3.13 micrograms/ml. While MICs of CZX to the PPNG strains were less than or equal to 0.003 - 0.024 micrograms/ml and to the non-PPNG strains were less than or equal to 0.003 - 0.05 micrograms/ml. Those patients with gonorrheal urethritis were given a single 0.5 g intramuscular dose of CZX and a single 1 g oral dose of probenecid. The following clinical findings were obtained: The clinical efficacy rate of 41 cases was 98%; excellent in 24, good in 16, poor in 1 case. All 3 patients with gonorrheal urethritis caused by PPNGs were cured with the treatment. No subjective side effects were found.
