A large, continuing outbreak of infection and colonisation with a Staphylococcus aureus which is resistant to methicillin and gentamicin is reported. Affected patients and staff members seen between September, 1980, and August, 1981, are reviewed in detail. Methods of management of such persons and their treatment, if required, are discussed. The antibiotic-resistant Staph. aureus is readily disseminated in hospitals and may cause outbreaks of infection in wards, which require isolation of affected patients in the attempt to control the problem. It is suggested that a special isolation unit is needed. Use of the few effective antibiotic agents should be restricted. Despite these measures, the spread of this organism may not be contained.
