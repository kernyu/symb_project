The aim of this investigation was the complex analysis of the dynamics of microflora at the focus of inflammation, the factors of the anti-infective resistance of the body and the clinical course of acute pneumonia in groups of children subjected to different kinds of antibacterial therapy (corresponding and not corresponding to the antibioticogram of the causative agent) or in the absence of antibacterial therapy, i.e. in groups 1, 2 and 3 respectively. As a result, differences in the change of microflora at the focus of inflammation were revealed. They were manifested, in particular, by the possibility of the development of microflora consisting of multiresistant strains as early as on day 7 of hospitalization. Different dynamics of the anti-infective resistance factors corresponded to changes in microflora at the focus of inflammation. No negative effect of antibiotics of the penicillin series and gentamicin on the levels of immunoglobulins, complement and on phagocytic activity was revealed.
