We compared the efficacy of ciprofloxacin with that of vancomycin by using the rabbit model of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus endocarditis. Endocarditis was treated with ciprofloxacin (25 mg/kg [body weight] intravenously every 8 h) or vancomycin (17.5 mg/kg intravenously every 6 h) for 3 days. Vancomycin and ciprofloxacin were equally efficacious in clearing bacteremia. Both reduced vegetation bacterial counts by 5 log10 CFU/g and renal and splenic bacterial counts by more than 3 log10 CFU/g as compared with untreated control rabbits after 26 h of infection (P less than 0.001). Both antimicrobial agents were able to eradicate the infectious process in an equivalent proportion of animals. No methicillin-resistant S. aureus that was recovered from ciprofloxacin-treated rabbits developed resistance to ciprofloxacin during therapy. Peak concentrations of ciprofloxacin in the sera of rabbits with endocarditis were significantly higher than those predicted by single-dose studies in uninfected rabbits. This finding was likely due to changes in the pharmacokinetics of the drug with multiple dosing and in infected versus uninfected rabbits. This study demonstrated that intravenously administered ciprofloxacin is as efficacious as vancomycin is in an in vivo model of a serious systemic methicillin-resistant S. aureus infection.
