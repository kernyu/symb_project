We studied the evolution of the resistance of Staphylococcus aureus to pefloxacin during 1985 and 1986 in eight hospital units. The pefloxacin resistant Staphylococcus aureus, which amounted to 8.9% in 1985 reached 27% in 1986. They are found mainly among the methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus. There is no obvious relationship between this resistance and the consumption of pefloxacin in each of the units.
