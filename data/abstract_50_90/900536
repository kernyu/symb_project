Seventeen cases of anaerobic infections in abdominal surgery are reported. Predominance of bacteroides is evident (9/17), especially bacteroides fragilis. The clinical manifestations of bacteroides infections are severe: 7 septicemias and 2 parietal infections, being the cause of the death in four patients. Bacteroides infection develops preferently in an old patient, with severe disease, in colic surgery especially in emergency. Bacteroides are characterized by their polyresistance to antibiotics: beta-lactamins, except carbenicillin, and aminosids. Metronidazole is a powerful bactericidal agent with a very low toxicity, particularly active in the treatment of these affections, as well as clindamycin. If oral route is impossible, chloramphenicol, I.V. tetracyclin, and above all carbenicillin are able to be used with success.
