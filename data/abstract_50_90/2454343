The efficiency of a number of antiarrhythmic drugs (etmozin, quinidine, mexytil, allapinin, cordarone), used alone and in combinations, was assessed in 13 patients with refractory continuous extrasystoles of varying origins. Antiarrhythmic effect of the drugs was evaluated by means of Holter ECG monitoring. Monotherapies were only effective in 3 patients, and developing side effects limited the possibilities of long-term use. Combined treatment produced a greater effect, while smaller doses of individual drugs making up the combination resulted in a better tolerance due to reduced side effects.
