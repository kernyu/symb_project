Susceptibility to 27 antimicrobial agents of 858 strains of staphylococci was determined. Tested strains belonged to the following species: S. epidermidis, S. saprophyticus, S. haemolyticus, S. hominis, S. simulans, S. warneri, S. cohnii, S. xylosus and S. intermedius. The antibiotics were: penicillin G, amoxycillin, augmentin, oxacillin, streptomycin, kanamycin, tobramycin, dibekacin, amikacin, gentamicin, sisomycin, netilmicin, doxycycline, minocycline, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, josamycin, clindamycin, pristinamycin, rifampin, fusidic acid, fosfomycin, trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole, cotrimoxazole, and vancomycin. The ATB system was used, with the criteria for categorization recommended by the Antibiotic Sensitivity Testing Committee. Penicillin-resistance, that was found in all species, was high for hospital-acquired strains (67 to 75%) but also for some other strains (32% for S. simulans). Oxacillin-resistance varied across species (0% for the least prevalent hospital strains, 6% for S. epidermidis and 28% for S. haemolyticus). All strains were susceptible to vancomycin. For some drugs, resistance was a characteristic of the species: resistance to fosfomycin was often found for S. saprophyticus, S. haemolyticus, S. warneri, S. cohnii, and S. capitis; resistance to trimethoprim was common for S. simulans, and S. haemolyticus. S. haemolyticus was the most resistant species, a fact that justifies routine identification of this pathogen in clinical specimens.
