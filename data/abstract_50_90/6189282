The production of interferon by bovine peripheral blood leukocytes infected with bovid herpesvirus 2 (BHV-2) was investigated in preparation for studying mechanisms of resistance to BHV-2. It was found that bovine peripheral blood monocytes produced high levels of interferon in response to BHV-2 inoculated at a multiplicity of 1. Virus-induced interferon was not stable at pH 2, was destroyed at 56 degrees C or by incubation with trypsin and was active against both vesicular stomatitis virus and BHV-2. Interferon of high specific activity was produced by incubating monocytes for 5 h with BHV-2 in serum-containing medium, replacing the inoculum with serum-free medium for an additional 16 h, and concentrating the serum-free medium by dialysis against dry polyethylene glycol. Interferon concentrations of 40,000 units per mg of protein were readily attained.
