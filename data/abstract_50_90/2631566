Syntheses and antibacterial properties of alkoxymethyl-3,4-dimethylpyridinium chlorides and 1-ethyloxymethyl-3-alkylthiomethylimidazolium chlorides are described. Alkoxymetgyl-3,4-dimethylpyridinium chlorides were synthetized by reacting 3,4-dimethylpyridine with chloromethyl alkyl ethers, while 1-ethyloxymethyl-3-alkylthiomethylimidazolium chlorides were obtained in reactions of 1-ethyloxymethylimidazol with chloromethyl alkyl sulfides. Antibacterial properties of the obtained compounds were tested on 13 strains of bacteria and fungi. Strong bacteriostatic activity was found to be displayed by iminium chlorides with octyloxymethyl, decyloxymethyl, octylthiomethyl and decylthiomethyl groups.
