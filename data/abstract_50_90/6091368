The inhibitory combination effect of cefmenoxime with gentamicin, tobramycin, netilmicin and amikacin against 148 Enterobacteriaceae was compared using the checkerboard agar dilution technique. On average 41% of cefmenoxime-moderately susceptible (MIC between 2 and 32 micrograms/ml) or cefmenoxime-resistant (MIC greater than 32 micrograms/ml) strains were inhibited by synergistic, and 23,5% by partial synergistic cefmenoxime-aminoglycosides combinations. Against cefmenoxime-susceptible strains, these rates of synergy or partial synergy were twofold lower, but only one isolate was not susceptible to these combinations. The amikacin-cefmenoxime interaction was the most performant.
