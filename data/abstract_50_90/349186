Three cases of Plasmodium falciparum malaria in seamen, all acquired while working off tropical West Africa, and all in patients coming in for treatment at a New Orleans hospital during one six-week period, are described in the context of the importance of considering recent travel history for arrival at the correct diagnosis and treatment. Two of the three patients whose cases are reported had taken some form of malarial chemoprophylaxis during their voyage.
