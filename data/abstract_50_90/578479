The effect of memantine (dimethylaminoadamantane), a new amantadinederivate with antiparknison-properties was investigated by the help of the sucrose gap method on sensory nerve fibres of the rat In normal Locke-solution memantine 10(-4) M reduced the amplitude of the compound action potential without change of the resting potential, increased the membrane resistance and depressed the repetitive activity elicited by depolarizing rectangular currents. The results of the experiments with changed concentrations of sodium, potassium and chloride ions in the suspensionmedium indicate that the membrane conductance of all three ions was reduced by memantine. Beside the antiparkinson properties these effects as well as those reported by others might be interpreted as a central muscle relaxing action of memantine. The possible implication of the demonstrated membrane effects of the drug is discussed in relation to its action on the dopaminergic transmission in the nigro-striatal system.
