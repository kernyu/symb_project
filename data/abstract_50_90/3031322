The extent of modulation of host resistance mechanisms by marijuana components is not fully understood. Natural killer (NK) cells are a subpopulation of lymphoid cells and are important in host resistance mechanisms against malignant cells, virus-infected cells, and possibly pathogenic bacteria and fungi. We report that the marijuana component delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) injected into mice results in a suppression of splenic NK activity. Furthermore, THC and the hydroxylated metabolite 11-hydroxy-delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (11-hydroxy-THC) suppress the NK activity of cultured murine splenocytes in a dose-dependent manner (range 1 X 10(-5) to 3.2 X 10(-5) M) without diminishing NK cell viability. The hydroxylated derivative appears to possess a more potent suppressive effect, in that it suppresses at lower concentrations than THC does and requires a shorter incubation time with the effector cells for its suppressive action. Purification of NK cells by Percoll density-gradient centrifugation suggests that both cannabinoids act directly on the natural killer cell population, resulting in suppression. Studies involving target binding analysis and calcium ionophore experiments suggest that cannabinoids do not suppress NK cell killing by the inhibition of effector/target binding or by disruption of calcium ion flux. These results suggest that two principal psychoactive cannabinoids can suppress natural killer cell function by interacting directly with the killer cells and disrupting cellular events postbinding and during the programming for lysis. Furthermore, the data suggest different modes of action for THC and the hydroxylated metabolite.
