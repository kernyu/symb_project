Evidence is presented that streptomycin-dependent mutants of Escherichia coli K-12 are incompatible with the functional activity of streptomycin-resistance genes coding for aminoglycoside adenilyl transferase. On the basis of this phenomenon, a method for selection of streptomycin-sensitive mutations in these genes is proposed, and the possibility of the direct selection of hybrid DNA molecules carrying inserts inactivating streptomycin-resistance genes is discussed. The effectiveness of the method for isolation of streptomycin-sensitive R100.1 plasmid derivatives was demonstrated.
