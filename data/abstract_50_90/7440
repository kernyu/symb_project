The simple architecture of the amphibian lung makes it possible to study the movement of substances across a barrier with permeability and bioelectric properties that are dominated by the alveolar epithelium. When mounted as a planar sheet between identical Ringer solutions the excised lung of the bullfrog exhibited a transmural electrical potential difference of nearly 20 mV (pleural surface positive) and a resistance of about 700 omega cm2. Unidirectional fluxes of 36Cl, Br-, I-, and SCN- across the short-circuited lung were asymmetrical. The net 36Cl- flow from pleura to lumen matched the short-circuit current after 1.5 h of voltage clamping, followed the kinetics of a saturable process, and was reduced by inhibitors of oxidative metabolism. These results suggest that halide and certain pseudohalide anions are secreted by the frog alveolar epithelium. Fluxes of Na+, K+, Ca+, HCO3-, TcO4-, SO42-, p-aminohippurate, gluconate, dinitrophenolate and water were compatible with passive diffusion of the probe molecules across the barrier. Measurements of lung oxygen consumption, ion fluxes and bioelectric properties have helped to pinpoint possible sites and modes of action of airborne agents, such as heavy metals, sulphates and nitrates, that may damage the mammalian pulmonary barrier.
