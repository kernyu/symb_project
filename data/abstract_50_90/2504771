In this study, we compared three human isolates (F5380, Scott A, and Murray B) and one laboratory strain (EGD) of Listeria monocytogenes for their resistance to ingestion and killing by human neutrophils. We observed no substantial difference in killing among these strains when they were grown at 37 degrees C. Because it is likely that listerial growth occurs at lower temperatures during food-borne outbreaks of listeriosis, we also compared these strains after they were grown at 22 and 4 degrees C. A general reduction in the ability of human neutrophils to kill L. monocytogenes was observed as the temperature at which the listeriae were grown decreased. Growth at 4 degrees C significantly decreased the killing of all four strains of L. monocytogenes by human neutrophils; two strains (EGD and F5380) were more resistant to killing than were the other two strains (Scott A and Murray B). No obvious relationship was noted between the chemiluminescence response of neutrophils to opsonized listeriae and the ability of the neutrophils to kill listeriae in vitro. Growth at 4 degrees C, however, significantly increased the resistance of L. monocytogenes to killing by hydrogen peroxide.
