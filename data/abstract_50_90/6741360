The immune status of 60 S. aureus carriers and 60 donors without carrier state was studied with respect to the interrelations of their antistaphylococcal immunity characteristics and natural resistance factors with the levels of different parameters. In contrast to the donors without carrier state, new interrelations between specific and nonspecific humoral immunity factors were shown to appear in S. aureus carriers, their blood sera having the elevated levels of bactericidal activity and the increased titers of staphylococcal antibodies. The phagocytic activity of the blood in the carriers proved to be below the normal level. The S. aureus carriers were found to have disturbances in the interrelations of their phagocytic activity and specific humoral immunity. The immune status of the carriers as characterized by the interrelations of its parameters is compared with the immune status of normal persons.
