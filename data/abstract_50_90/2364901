Thirteen randomly selected multiresistant strains of E. coli, Klebsiella species and providencia stuartii, isolated from Gondar Hospital patients, were investigated for the presence of transferable drug resistance. Resistance transfer occurred in 10 (77%) of the 13 strains. All the transferable resistances were found to be mediated by plasmids of the incompatibility groups H1, FII.J1 and C. The high frequency of the H1 plasmids observed in Klebisella strains, indicates multiresistant nosocomial Klebsiella infections in Gondar Hospital. Restricted use of antimicrobial agents and further studies of the problems of plasmid-mediated drug resistance are recommended.
