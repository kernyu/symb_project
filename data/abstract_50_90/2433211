CSF-1 is a growth and differentiation factor for the production of mononuclear phagocytes from undifferentiated bone marrow progenitors. In addition to previously described effects on mature cells, we show here that CSF-1 stimulates the production by monocytes of interferon, tumor necrosis factor, and myeloid CSF that produces mainly mixed neutrophil-macrophage colonies in bone marrow culture. Pretreatment with CSF-1 also promotes resistance to viral infection and tumor cytotoxicity in murine peritoneal macrophages. Based on amino acid sequence data of purified human urinary and murine L cell CSF-1, we have cloned the complementary DNA (cDNA) from messenger RNA (mRNA) of the human CSF-1 producing MIA PaCa cell line. The cDNA specifies a 32 amino acid signal peptide followed by a protein of 224 amino acids. Several facts suggest, however, that one-third of the molecule at the C-terminal end is processed off intracellularly to derive the secreted growth factor. The gene is about 18 kilobases (kb) in length and contains 9 exons. Although there appears to be a single copy gene for CSF-1, cells expressing the factor contain several mRNA species, suggesting that the gene may have several functions or levels of regulation. High level expression of the recombinant protein will allow preclinical testing in several disease models for therapeutic efficacy that has been suggested from in vitro and in vivo biological properties of CSF-1.
