In April of 1977 an outbreak of falciparum malaria occurred among the Mayongong Indians, located at Uauaris in the Territory of Roraima, Brazil. Blood specimens from 157 Indians were examined for Plasmodium; 62 were found to be infected. In three cases the infection was not cured with chloroquine but responded favorably to the drug combination of sulfadoxine and pyrimethamine (Fansidar).
