Growth in a single broth microdilution well containing gentamicin at a concentration of 500 micrograms/ml predicted high-level resistance to gentamicin (MIC, greater than or equal to 2,000 micrograms/ml) in 505 of 508 clinical isolates of enterococci. Failure to achieve synergistic killing with the combination of penicillin and an aminoglycoside was demonstrated with 100% specificity in 20 strains which showed resistance to 500 micrograms of gentamicin per ml. We recommend this procedure be adopted as a routine screening test to detect high-level aminoglycoside resistance in enterococci.
