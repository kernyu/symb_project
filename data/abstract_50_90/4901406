A mutation in Escherichia coli to resistance to the aminoglycoside antibiotic kasugamycin alters the 30S ribosomal subunit. Though all other known 30S ribosomal mutations are located in a cluster in the streptomycin region, kasugamycin resistance is located at a distance from this region, near the leucine region.
