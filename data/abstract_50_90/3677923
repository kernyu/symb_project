SEWATC13 mouse cells, resistant to 0.1 microgram/ml of actinomycin D (AMD), were fused to AMD-sensitive cells of the Chinese hamster ovary cell line (CHO). Twenty-two hybrid clones were isolated and put into serial culture in the selective medium. Unexpectedly, identifiable mouse chromosomes were found only in one of the hybrids. All the others had only hamster chromosomes and, in addition, numerous chromatin bodies (CBs), mostly small and irregularly shaped, but also larger, more chromosome-like ones. The CBs were distinctly C-band positive and a mouse satellite probe hybridized strongly to them. The AMD resistance of the murine parental cells had previously been attributed to gene amplification in two large homogeneously staining regions (HSR-AMD1 and 2). They were not observed in the hybrid cells but had supposedly reappeared in the guise of the CBs. It was established by Southern DNA blot analysis that amplified DNA sequences, localized to the HSR-AMD1 and 2 of the SEWA parent were present in multiple copies in the hybrids. It was also established by in situ hybridization that they were located in the CBs. Unlike double minutes (DMs) the CBs were all centric.
