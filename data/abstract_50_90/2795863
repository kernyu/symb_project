Cefodizime (CDZM, THR-221) was given intravenously to 20 children with the following acute bacterial infections: 2 cases each of tonsillitis, bronchitis, purulent cervical lymphadenitis, and urinary tract infections and 12 cases of pneumonia. Good clinical responses were obtained in 18 patients out of the 20, and bacteriologically, all of the 5 strains identified were eradicated. No side effect was obtained except one case of eosinophilia. From the above clinical results, it is apparent that CDZM is a useful antibiotic for the treatment of pediatric patients with various kinds of bacterial infections.
