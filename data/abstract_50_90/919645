The problems arisen from plasmid mediated drug-resistance can only be solved by a chemotherapeutic drug policy with due regard to the different ecological processes. The antibiotic policy has the following purpose: 1. Estimation and prognosis of the use of chemotherapeutics in the therapy and prophylaxis of man and animals, the animal production, other paratherapeutic fields of application (feed-stuff industry, cosmetics etc.); 2. methods for the limitation of the spreading of infectious drug resistance; 3. production and import of chemotherapeutic drugs (inclusively antibiotics); 4. development of new drugs especially for their different application in medicine, veterinarian medicine and other fields. The drug policy is based upon the surveillance of infectious drug resistance and drug monitoring (effectiveness, economy, and side effects of the drugs).
