The in-vitro activity of coumermycin was compared with that of vancomycin, rifampicin, fusidic acid, trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole, norfloxacin and cefamandole against seven isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and 97 isolates of methicillin-resistant coagulase negative staphylococci. Apart from one strain of methicillin-resistant S. aureus all isolates were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.06 mg/l of coumermycin. Cefamandole was more active against strains of S. epidermidis than against other coagulase negative staphylococci.
