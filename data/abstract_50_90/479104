Optimal transformation of Azotobacter vinelandii OP required a 20-min incubation of the competent cells with deoxyribonucleic acid at 30 degrees C in buffer (pH 6.0 to 8.0) containing 8 mM magnesium sulfate. Nitrogen-fixing transformants of nitrogen fixation-deficient recipients could be plated immediately on selective medium, but transformants acquiring rifampin and streptomycin resistance required preincubation in nonselective medium. The three phenotypes achieved an approximately equal and stable frequency after 17 h (six generations) of growth in nonselective medium.
