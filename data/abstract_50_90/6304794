Plasmid species isolated from aminocyclitol-resistant Staphylococcus aureus have been analyzed by restriction endonuclease digestion and electron microscopy. These plasmids can be divided into two interrelated groups; intergroup variability is due to the gain or loss of defined DNA sequences. Plasmids pSJ1 and pSJ24 are related to staphylococcal penicillinase plasmid pI524 which was first described over 20 years ago. Both pSJ1 and pSJ24 differ from pI524 by the acquisition of 8 and 4 kbp, respectively, and encode additional resistance to the antibiotics erythromycin and kanamycin. The gain of these resistance determinants suggests that the evolution of staphylococcal resistance plasmids parallels that observed for plasmids of gram-negative bacteria and has serious implications for the spread of antibiotic resistance among the staphylococci.
