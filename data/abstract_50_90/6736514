To elucidate the epidemiology of nosocomial infections occurring in nursing homes and chronic care facilities, the authors undertook a prospective study of patients requiring two different levels of nursing care. The overall rate of infection was higher on the intermediate care ward than on the nursing home ward (1.35 versus 0.67 infections/100 patient care days). Pneumonias and symptomatic urinary tract infections accounted for 49 per cent of all infections. Eight of ten cases of pneumonia occurring on the nursing home ward were diagnosed in the winter months, and no case was diagnosed in the summer months. Resistance to gentamicin, tobramycin, ampicillin, and trimethoprim-sulfa was common among organisms causing symptomatic urinary tract infections.
