A simplified method has been devised for typing Pseudomonas aeruginosa by pyocin production. Pyocins are produced as strains grow overnight in Trypticase soy broth (without glucose) plus 1% potassium nitrate. Because P. aeruginosa can use nitrate instead of oxygen as a terminal electron acceptor, mechanical shaking is not necessary, nor is induction by mitomycin C. Pyocins can now be produced in screw-cap tubes in a water bath or incubator. A total of 250 strains were tested as possible pyocin indicators, which included 60 strains already used in pyocin-typing systems. The final set contained 18 indicators which were chosen because (i) they had clear positive or clear negative reactions, thus eliminating reactions difficult to read, (ii) they had few zones due to bacteriophage lysis, and (iii) they were most sensitive in differentiating clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa. The final typing method was tested in several studies and the results were clear; thus definitive epidemiological conclusions could be made. Because it is simple to perform and easily automated, the new method should have application in many hospitals; however, it should be used only in carefully planned epidemiological studies. The method and its application are described in detail, and some pitfalls are discussed.
