We have tested possibilities of Escherichia coli strains dependent on drugs streptomycin and paromomycin for selection of spontaneous mutations in the RP4 kan gene specifying resistance to aminoglycosids--kanamycin, neomycin and paromycin. A set of kan gene mutations were obtained, classified ad mapped.
