The mode of action of berninamycin on bacterial protein synthesis is related to that of thiostrepton, a dissimilar compound. Both antibiotics bind to the complex of 23S RNA with protein L11 and both affect various functions of the ribosomal A site. Also, Streptomyces bernensis and Streptomyces azureus (which, respectively, produce berninamycin and thiostrepton) possess similar ribosomal RNA methylases capable of rendering ribosomes resistant to these compounds. Resistance involves specific pentose-methylation of 23S ribosomal RNA.
