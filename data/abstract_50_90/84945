In a 10-week period, infection with gentamicin resistant Staphylococcus aureus appeared in 24 adults and infants in one hospital. Medical staff were affected first, and subsequently 16 infants in the neonatal intensive-care unit. The gentamicin-resistant staphyloccal isolates showed three distinct phage susceptibility patterns in two distinct phage groups during the early, middle, and late phases of the outbreak. Although not confirmed with in-vitro or in-vivo laboratory data, this outbreak suggests that gentamicin resistance may be transferred between different strains of Staph. aureus in vivo.
