Gamma interferon, an immune lymphokine that protects mouse macrophages against infection by several parasites, was ineffective against Mycobacterium lepraemurium. On the contrary, it significantly stimulated multiplication of M. lepraemurium in the macrophages. Simultaneous treatment of macrophages with gamma interferon and interleukin-4 or interleukin-2 or a combination of all three did not enhance the macrophage resistance to infection with M. lepraemurium, but instead stimulated growth of M. lepraemurium.
