Neotelomycin induced lysis of the protoplasts of Bac. megaterium and inhibited their succinate dehydrogenase activity. Direct correlation between the lytic activity of the antibiotic and its effect on succinate dehydrogenase was found. Neotelomycin had no effect on the dehydrogenase activity of the protoplast lysates. Possibly, suppression of the protoplast succinate dehydrogenase of Bac. megaterium under the effect of neotelomycin was due to significant structural changes caused by the antibiotic in the protoplast membranes and leading to their lysis and not to the direct effect on the enzyme. Neotelomycin had practically no effect on the spheroplast dehydrogenase activity of E. coli resistant to the antibiotic and did not induce their lysis. Resistance of E. coli to neotelomycin must be associated not with the presence of the antibiotic non-permeable cell wall but the peculiar properties of the membrane cytoplasm.
