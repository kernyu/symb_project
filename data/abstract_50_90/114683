With the investigations of the effect of combination of hetacillin, cephapirin and amikacin, following experimental results were obtained; 1. Effect of combination of amikacin, cephapirin and hetacillin was differed depending upon the genus and species of bacteria. However, in general, in the cases showing effective results there was a relation in the concentration of these antibiotics. With strains of Escherichia coli amikacin and cephapirin was cooperative, but not with other combinations and strains of Proteus showed similar tendencies to those strains. In the strains of Pseudomonas, no effect was observed with these antibiotics. However, significant cooperative effect was shown in strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae. In penicillin-resistant strains of Staphylococci cooperative effect was represented only a combination of amikacin and hetacillin. 2. Amikacin was resistant against penicillinase isolated from penicillin-resistant strain of Staphylococcus and cephalosporinase extracted from cephalosporin-resistant strain of Escherichia coli. 3. When a strain of K. pneumoniae, showing cooperative effect with amikacin and cephapirin, was examined by electronmicroscopy, enlargement of cells and destruction of the cell walls were observed.
