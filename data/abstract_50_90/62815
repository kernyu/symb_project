Sixty-nine strains of gentamicin-resistant gram-negative bacilli obtained from different geographical sources were tested for susceptibility to 11 aminoglycoside antibiotics. From the results of determinations of minimal inhibitory concentrations, patterns of resistance were established for 45 strains of Enterobacteriaceae and 24 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Overall, 81% of the strains were sensitive to amikacin and 33% of the strains were sensitive to butirosin, the next most active compound. Results indicated that 54% of the P. aeruginosa strains were sensitive to amikacin and 33% were sensitive to tobramycin. From resistance patterns, enzymes responsible for inactivation of the antibiotics were deduced. The most common enzyme was aminoglycoside nucleotidyltransferase(2''), either alone or combined with either aminoglycoside phosphotransferase(3')-I or aminoglycoside phosphotransferase(3')-II. Aminoglycoside acetyltransferase(2) was identified exclusively in strains of Providencia stuartii. Specific enzymes could not be identified for 30 strains, 21 of which were P. aeruginosa.
