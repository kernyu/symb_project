We have constructed a probe specific for the gene ereA of plasmid pIP1100, which confers high-level resistance to erythromycin in Escherichia by production of an erythromycin esterase. The distribution of the gene ereA in enterobacteria highly resistant to erythromycin isolated from human faeces was studied by colony hybridization. The gene ereA was detected in strains of E. coli belonging to various biotypes, in Klebsiella pneumoniae, in Enterobacter agglomerans and in one strain of a "coliform". Moreover, our results indicated the existence of at least two classes of genes specifying resistance to erythromycin by inactivation of the antibiotic in enterobacteria.
