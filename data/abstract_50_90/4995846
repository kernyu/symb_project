The activities are reported of sodium salts of several n-alkylsalicylic acids against Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Mycobacterium phlei, and Candida albicans. The acids had alkyl substituents of 1 to 18 carbon atoms in the 3, 4, or 5 positions relative to the carboxyl group of salicylic acid. Generally, the antimicrobial properties were typical of anionic surface-active agents although the salicylates are more potent than most of these, particularly against S. aureus.
