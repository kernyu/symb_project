Photodynamic effects were demonstrated and assayed under field conditions in a number of different laboratory strains and pond isolates of cyanobacteria; parameters assayed for resistance to photooxidation were viable count, turbidity of the cyanobacterial suspension, and protein and pigment contents. The effects of density, colonial structure, and internal gas vacuoles on the lethal outcome were investigated. The stability and formation of superoxide dismutase under photooxidative conditions in the field and laboratory were studied in the different strains. An isolate of Microcystis from blooms in ponds exhibited extremely high resistance to photooxidation, which was abolished by exposure to chloramphenicol.
