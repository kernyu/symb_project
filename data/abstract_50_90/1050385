Patients undergoing dental extractions were non-randomly allocated to three groups, one of which received no antibiotic, one benzylpenicillin followed by oral penicillin for 5 days, and the third intramuscular lincomycin followed by oral clindamycin. Dental extraction was performed at the beginning of the course of chemotherapy. Streptococci were isolated from the extracted teeth, from blood cultures collected before and immediately after dental extraction, and from sutures removed from the gums 5-7 days after the operation. The species of these organisms was determined, and their susceptibilities to penicillin, clindamycin, cephaloridine, erythromycin and tetracycline were assessed. The majority of streptococci isolated from teeth belonged to the species Streptococcus sanguis, S. mitior, S. mutans and S. milleri. Occasional isolates of each of these organisms collected before the antibiotic could take effect were resistant to penicillin. Three of these species, but not S. mutans, were the commonest streptococci to be isolated from the blood after dental extraction. Penicillin completely suppressed dental bacteriaemia under the conditions of our investigation, and lincomycin reduced the incidence by about 60 per cent. The commonest streptococci from sutures were also S. sanguis, S. mitior, S. mutans and S. milleri. S. faecalis was also isolated, but only in patients who had received antibiotics. Among the non-faecalis organisms, penicillin resistance was significantly more frequent among isolates from patients given penicillin than from patients not given this antibiotic, and clindamycin resistance was significantly more frequent among isolates from patients given lincomycin and clindamycin than from patients not given these antibiotics.
