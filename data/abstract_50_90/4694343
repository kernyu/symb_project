Extremely to slightly halophilic bacteria were tested for susceptibility to two sterilizing agents, peracetic acid (PAA) and ethylene oxide (ETO). PAA susceptibility was explored by two methods: an agar plate (constant pH of 7.2) and a filter strip (constant incubation period of 37 days); 100% susceptibility was obtained by both methods. The dosage (0.5 ml/min) was applied to a filter pad in a petri dish cover. Glove box experiments with ETO (input 1.5 lb. [ca. 680.4 g]/24 hr, the only constant) yielded 100% susceptibility for all halophiles tested. These experiments demonstrated the efficacy of two lethal agents for extreme halophiles, PAA and ETO. Variation in pH did not affect susceptibility.
