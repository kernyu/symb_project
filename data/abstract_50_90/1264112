Complete inhibition of growth of sensitive L5178Y mouse lymphoma cells in culture was obtained with 10(-3)M ouabain, 1.65 X 10(-3)M thymidine, 1.8 X 10(-4)M thioguanine and 10(-6)M cytosine arabinoside. The toxicity of methotrexate was dependent upon cell density and this compound was excluded from further study. The expression time before addition of the selective agent was important for detecting EMS induced resistant variants. Ouabain-resistant variants appeared immediately after treatment and were present over a broad time span. No excess thymidine- or thioguanine-resistant variants were seen initially; a peak in variant numbers was seen for excess thymidine resistance at 48-96 h and for thioguanine resistance at 144-192 h. Using induced mutation frequencies at optimum expression times, equal EMS treatments yielded substantially more variants resistant to thioguanine than to ouabain. It is suggested that this difference may have origin in possible constraints in the classes of mutants which are permissible in a vital function, maintenance of the Na+/K+ balance, when compared with a non-vital function, salvage purine biosynthesis. Some data are presented on the stability in culture of resistant variants. A limited number of observations were made following treatment in the peritoneal cavity of the mouse which were in broad agreement with the above results.
