Experimental and clinical studies on cefotiam (CTM), a new synthetic cephalosporin, were performed in digestive diseases. Among the 7 cases of 'cholelithiasis and cholangitis', 6 cases (86%) showed better response than "effective". Among the 9 cases of infections except 'cholelithiasis and cholangitis' which had no connection with cancers, 6 cases (67%) showed better response than "effective". Among the 15 cases of 'infections following advanced cancers', 7 cases (47%) showed better response than "effective". This inferior result was due to the relation to factors coming from cancers. CTM was effective in not only infections of the aged but that which resisted antibiotics of penicillins and the other cephems. Sensitivity of E. coli, Klebsiella and S. aureus was made a comparative study of by MIC and disc test. It was found as a result that CTM had the equal or superior antimicrobial activity to other antibiotics of cephems, penicillins and aminoglycosides.
