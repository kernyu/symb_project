Crossbred young pigs were used to test whether abbreviated infections with eggs of Ascaris suum can stimulate the acquisition of resistance to challenge. Weanling pigs from an Ascaris-free colony were kept free of A. suum until they were divided into groups at the age of 7-8 weeks. The experimental animals received pyrantel tartrate during the period when they were being exposed to increasing numbers of infective A. suum eggs and challenged 10 days after the last infective dose. Liver milk-spot counts and larval recoveries from the lungs indicated that the strongest resistance was acquired by the animals that received the drug continuously for 6 weeks while being exposed to six weekly infective egg doses. The data do not suggest any drug-related suppression of the resistance response to A. suum infection.
