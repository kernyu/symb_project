L-forms of a strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were produced by serial subculture of the bacterial form on agar medium containing sucrose as an osmotic stabilizer and carbenicillin. L-forms eventually became stable, i.e., would not revert in the absence of antibiotic, and were adapted to grow well in broth with the osmotic stabilizer. Gross morphology and light microscopic colony morphology were typical of an L-form. L-form cells were approximately spherical and bounded in part by a plasma membrane; they lacked the triple-layer cell wall structure and coarse, electron-dense nucleoidal granules of the parent bacterial form. The L-form, but not the bacterial form, contained cores, organelles previously reported only in group D streptococci. Antibiotic disc-sensitivity studies showed the stable L-form to be as sensitive as, or more sensitive than, the bacterial form to most antibiotics. Exceptions were polymyxin B, colimycin sulfate, and gentamicin, which were more active against the bacterial form. The remainder of the aminoglycosides and cell wall-active antibiotics showed no inhibition of either form. The L-form was more susceptible to cidal activity of normal human serum than the parent form. The L-form exhibited fewer biochemical activities than the parent bacteria or bacterial forms derived by reversion at a time when the L-form was still unstable. L-form colonies appeared colorless, and chemical analysis demonstrated that, if the L-form produces pigment at all, which was not demonstrated, it could not have been more than 3.6% of that produced by the bacterial form.
