Ampicillin-resistant and -susceptible strains of Haemophilus influenzae were tested for susceptibility to 16 antibiotics. Chloramphenicol and a new cephalosporin, cefamandole, were most active with minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for all bacteria tested between 0.5 to 2.0 mug/ml. All but two organisms were susceptible to tetracycline. Ampicillin-resistant strains of H. influenzae were less susceptible (MIC, 4 to 32 mug/ml) to carbenicillin and ticarcillin than ampicillin-susceptible organisms (MIC, 0.25 to 1.0 mug/ml). A rapid assay for beta-lactamase, utilizing a chromogenic cephalosporin substrate, detected enzyme production in all 17 ampicillin-resistant strains of H. influenzae.
