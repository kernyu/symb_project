Clinical isolates of Gardnerella vaginalis, Streptococcus agalactiae, Bacteroides spp., and Mobiluncus spp. were screened for resistance to tetracycline and for the presence of the streptococcal tetM determinant. The S. agalactiae and G. vaginalis strains contained DNA sequences homologous to the tetM determinant, while strains of the other two genera did not.
