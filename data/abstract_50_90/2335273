The authors tested whether mutant strains of Caenorhabditis elegans with altered sensitivity to volatile anesthetics have altered responses to GABA or GABA-agonists. They determined the ED50s of the wild-type strain N2 and two mutant strains of C. elegans to a GABA-mimetic ivermectin (IVM) and to GABA. unc-79, a strain with increased sensitivity to halothane, was more sensitive than N2 to IVM and GABA. unc-9, a strain that suppresses the increased sensitivity of unc-79 to halothane, was less sensitive than N2 to IVM and GABA. The authors also tested whether doses of GABA or IVM and volatile anesthetics were additive in their effects on C. elegans. Halothane (2.1%) did not shift the ED50 of IVM, but was antagonistic to GABA. Enflurane (4%) was antagonistic to both IVM and GABA. However, ED50s of halothane and enflurane were unchanged in the presence of IVM (35 nM) or GABA (150 mM). The authors conclude that GABA by itself does not appear to mediate halothane or enflurane sensitivity in C. elegans.
