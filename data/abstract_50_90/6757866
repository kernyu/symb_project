Two independent erythromycin resistance mutations, ER514 and ER221, have been identified in the mitochondrial gene coding for the 21S ribosomal RNA. The two mutations were found to be identical, corresponding to a A to G transition at the nucleotide position 1951 of the ribosomal RNA gene. In the secondary structure model of the ribosomal RNA, the ER resistance site is found at the proximity of the chloramphenicol resistance sites located about 500 bases downstream.
