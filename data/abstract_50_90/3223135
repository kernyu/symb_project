The Resistance-Pattern-Analysis (RPA)-the procedure will be described- makes possible a comparison of susceptibility test results of different antibiotics independent of patient and test related factors. Using two examples, the comparative assessment of a more recent antibiotic with well-tried older antibiotics and the selection of antibiotics for an interventive therapy, whereby the pathogen being unknown the therapy is based upon the probable pathogen, the expected susceptibility and the localization of the infection the practicability will be illustrated. A RPA of 1526 bacterial isolates was carried out using aztreonam, gentamicin and amikacin. Aztreonam was superior to amikacin against all species tested. In comparison to gentamicin, aztreonam showed the best results against Pseudomonadaceae. Using common combinations of antibiotics for the initial interventive therapy the possible use of RPA for a cost-risk-analysis from a medical microbiological viewpoint will be demonstrated.
