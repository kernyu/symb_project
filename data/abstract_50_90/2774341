The Langendorff isolated heart preparation was adapted to determine the effect of furazolidone (0.5 and 2 micrograms/ml of perfusate) on hearts of 3-week-old broiler chickens. Following 115 minutes of perfusion, both concentrations of furazolidone caused approximately a two-fold increase in myocardial vascular resistance and a six-fold increase in lactate dehydrogenase release into the effluent fluid, compared with a control perfused group of isolated hearts (P less than 0.01). Ultrastructural alteration differences were not found between the drug-treated and control groups. It was concluded that: (i) furazolidone, at concentrations only moderately above therapeutic plasma concentrations, caused detrimental changes in myocardial vascular resistance and lactate dehydrogenase release and (ii) the isolated chicken heart preparation is an example of a cost-effective, reliable laboratory tool for screening potential cardiotoxins.
