Pneumococci relatively insensitive to penicillin G were isolated from the sputum of two patients with pneumonia. One of the organisms was also relatively insensitive to ampicillin, cefamandole, and cephalothin and was resistant to tetracycline. Because penicillin-insensitive pneumococci are being reported with greater frequency, continued surveillance of pneumococcal sensitivity to penicillin is appropriate.
