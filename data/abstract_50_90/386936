A new variant of media with antibiotics for isolation of Shigella, i.e. a method of 2 streaks each containing different antibiotics was tested in analysis of excrements from patients with acute dysentery. It was found that the new method is more effective than the well known method of gradient plates (isolation of Shigella in one series of the experiments amounted to 85.2 and 64.7 per cent respectively, and in the other series of the experiments the respective figures were 95.4 and 89.3 per cent). Its efficiency was lower as compared to the procedure of inoculation onto 2 plates, i.e. onto the media with and without an antibiotic (isolation of Shigella was 67.5 and 77.4 per cent respectively). The new method provided a higher frequency of Shigella isolation as compared to inoculation onto the media without an antibiotic, as well as onto any of the media used with one antibiotic. The method of 2 streaks offers wider possibilities for choosing the antibiotics for adding to the nutrient medium, as well as estimation of the antibioticograms and species structures of Shigella distributed in a concrete area.
