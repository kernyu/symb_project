Chemoprophylaxis of meningococcal disease is still necessary in spite of the availability of an effective vaccine against group A, C, Y and W135 strain meningococci. After emergence of sulphonamide resistant meningococcal strains, rifampin has been the drug used for chemoprophylaxis. Development of rifampin resistance in meningococci during short term prophylactic treatments makes this treatment less suitable. At present, there are several studies where ciprofloxacin has shown good effect in eradication of meningococci from nasopharyngeal carriers. It also seems obvious that one single dose of ciprofloxacin is enough for the purpose. Ciprofloxacin can be recommended for chemoprophylaxis of meningococcal disease in adults.
