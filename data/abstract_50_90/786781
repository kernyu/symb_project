Resistance to the protein synthesis inhibitor trichodermin in Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been studied. A single recessive nuclear gene was responsible for resistance. The resistance locus, tcm1 was found to be closely linked (1 centi-morgan) to the locus pet 17 on the right arm of chromosome XV. The mutation to trichodermin resistance conferred resistance to other 12,13-epoxytrichothecenes and to the structurally unrelated antibiotic anisomycin.
