Combinations of EDTA-tromethamine and 7 antimicrobial agents (chloramphenicol, nalidixic acid, oxytetracycline, penicillin, polymyxin-B, streptomycin, and a triple sulfonamide preparation) were tested for synergistic activities against Staphylococcus aureus, Corynebacterium renal, Listeria monocytogenes, Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae, and a beta-hemolytic streptococci. Two in vitro tests were used--minimal inhibitory concentrations of the drugs and a 2-dimensional Microtiter checkerboard technique. A slight synergistic action was seen when L monocytogenes was exposed to combinations of penicillin-EDTA or streptomycin-EDTA.
