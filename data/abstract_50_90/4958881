Sparling, Philip F. (Communicable Disease Center, Atlanta, Ga.). Genetic transformation of Neisseria gonorrhoeae to streptomycin resistance. J. Bacteriol. 92:1364-1371. 1966.-Eight strains of Neisseria gonorrhoeae were transformed to streptomycin resistance by deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) extracted from a streptomycin-resistant strain of N. gonorrhoeae. In all strains, competence was greatest in the naturally occurring, virulent clonal types 1 and 2, which gave transformation frequencies up to 1%. Clonal types 3 and 4, which arise on laboratory transfer and are avirulent, gave maximal transformation frequencies of 0.00005%. Competence was maximal in lag and early log phases of growth, but was maintained throughout the growth cycle. A complex broth was required for the physiological expression of competence. The kinetics of DNA uptake, dose-response curve of DNA versus transformants, time required for phenotypic expression, and other features were similar to those in other bacterial transformation systems.
