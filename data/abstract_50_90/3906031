Deletions of the ponA and ponB genes of Escherichia coli have been constructed in vitro and recombined into the chromosome to produce strains that completely lack penicillin-binding protein 1A or penicillin-binding protein 1B. In each case a DNA fragment internal to the gene was replaced by a fragment encoding an antibiotic resistance. The ponA and ponB deletions can therefore be readily introduced into other E. coli strains by P1 transduction of the antibiotic resistance. Although the complete absence of penicillin-binding protein 1A or penicillin-binding protein 1B was tolerated, the absence of both of these proteins was shown to result in bacterial lysis.
