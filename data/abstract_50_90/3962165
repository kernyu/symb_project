An in vitro technique is described for detecting resistance of nematodes to the anthelmintic levamisole hydrochloride. Samples of eggs are developed under controlled temperature conditions until just prior to the commencement of hatching. They are then exposed to different concentrations of the drug and, when hatching is almost complete, the test samples are killed and preserved. The proportion of unhatched eggs at each drug concentration can then be counted at leisure. Provided a suitable range of drug concentrations is chosen for each test isolate, this assay provides results which may be satisfactorily fitted to a log-concentration-probit regression model. Comparisons with in vivo anthelmintic assays have shown that the technique provides an accurate reflection of the resistance status of parasite populations.
