Fecal specimens from individuals traveling to Mexico were examined before, during, and after travel for the presence of Escherichia coli resistant to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, kanamycin, streptomycin, sulfonamides, trimethoprim (TMP), and TMP-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX). None of these individuals took prophylactic antibiotics, although 4 of 13 took short courses of an antimicrobial agent for therapy of traveler's diarrhea. With an average of 9.3 E. coli per sample, resistance to all agents tested except gentamicin was shown to increase during the time in Mexico (P less than 0.001 to P less than 0.05). For example, no TMP-resistant (Tmpr) E. coli isolates were found by this method before travel, whereas 57% of the individuals had Tmpr and Tmpr-Smxr E. coli by the final week in Mexico. This increase in resistance occurred regardless of whether an individual took a short course of antimicrobial therapy. This study shows that travel itself, even without the use of prophylactic or therapeutic antimicrobial agents, is associated with the acquisition of resistant E. coli. Travel to developing nations may rival other sources of resistant organisms.
