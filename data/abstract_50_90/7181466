It was shown that amphotericin B, a polyenic macrolide markedly potentiated in mice the interferonogenic activity of the two-strand synthetic polyribonucleotide complexes, Poly (G) . Poly (C) and Poly (G, I) . Poly (C). At the same time amphotericin B used in high or low doses lowered or somewhat increased respectively the protective effect of Poly (G) . Poly (C) and Poly (G, I) . Poly (C) which was not adequate to the antibiotic effect on their interferonogenic activity. It was found that amphotericin B stimulated in the mice the infection caused by the forest spring encephalitis virus, accelerated the period of its manifestation and increased the death rate. This effect correlated with the concentration of amphotericin B and the dose of the virus. The relationship between the differential effect of amphotericin B on the interferonogenic and antiviral activity of polyribonucleotide interferonogenes and the stimulation of the viral infection by them is discussed.
