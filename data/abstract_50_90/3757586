The comparative in vitro activity of ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, aztreonam, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, mezlocillin, azlocillin, and tobramycin was evaluated against 188 isolates from bacteremic patients and 161 aminoglycoside-resistant gram-negative rods. Although some streptococcal (particularly enterococcal) blood isolates, Pseudomonas spp., and nonfermentative gram-negative rods were not inhibited by ciprofloxacin, it was nevertheless the most active compound tested against both microorganism groups.
