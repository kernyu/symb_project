The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of the newer beta-lactam antibiotic, imipenem, were compared with those of cefoxitin, cefotetan, penicillin, amoxycillin, ticarcillin and metronidazole against 114 clinical isolates of the Bacteroides fragilis group of anaerobic organisms. The ability of clavulanic acid, a beta-lactamase inhibitor, to potentiate the in vitro activity of amoxycillin and ticarcillin was also studied. Using an agar dilution technique we found imipenem to be the most active beta-lactam antibiotic tested having an MIC50 of 0.25 microgram/ml and inhibiting all isolates at a concentration of 4 micrograms/ml. Metronidazole had comparable activity with a MIC50 of 0.5 microgram/ml and all isolates inhibited by 1 microgram/ml. Cefoxitin and cefotetan showed similar activity both with a MIC50 of 8 micrograms/ml against the B. fragilis group, while penicillin, amoxycillin and ticarcillin all had a MIC50 of 16 micrograms/ml. Clavulanic acid significantly reduced the MIC50 of amoxycillin and ticarcillin to 0.5 micrograms/ml and 0.25 micrograms/ml, respectively.
