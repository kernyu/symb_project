Mice were vaccinated with six strains of Salmonella and two strains of Escherichia coli, as well as with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus vulgaris, and Serratia marcescens. The amount of in vivo growth of each organism was followed by viable counting techniques on organ homogenates. The vaccinated mice, along with unvaccinated controls, were challenged intravenously with 1,000 ld(50) of a streptomycin-resistant strain of Salmonella enteritidis. The ability of the vaccine to protect the mice against virulent challenge correlated with the ability of the strain to establish a persisting population in the liver and spleen. Enumeration of the liver and spleen populations in the challenged mice revealed that extensive growth of S. enteritidis occurred in animals which showed "protection," as assessed by progressive mortality data. No evidence was obtained for a major role of humoral factors in the cross-protection against intravenous S. enteritidis challenge.
