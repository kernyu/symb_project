The possibility of gene suppression by the expression of anti-sense sequences has been tested for tet gene of pBR322 plasmid. Anti-tet gene has been inserted into lac-promoter regulated site of M13mp 10 single-stranded high copy phage vector. To achieve that, HihdIII-BamHI fragment of pBR322 carrying part of the tet gene was inserted into poly-linker of mp 10. The influence of the anti-tet gene expression on growth parameters of cells with or without tetracycline in the growth media was monitored for JM103 cells. The results indicate that in this system the detectable suppression of the tet gene by anti-tet expression was not manifested.
