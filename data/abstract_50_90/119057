Forty-five men, with acute gonococcal urethritis, were treated with a single dose regime of Probenecid 1 gm and Procaine penicillin, 4.8 mega-units, yielding a cure in 97 per cent. Multiple antibiotic resistance was noted in 69 per cent of 28 Neisseria gonorrhoeae isolates, and of 19 isolates tested for precise penicillin sensitivity, 58 per cent were resistant to greater than 2 i.u./ml. Serum penicillin levels measured in 3 patients showed adequate duration of plateau levels. The advantages of adopting such a regime are discussed.
