2563 salmonella strains having been isolated by veterinary laboratories in the Federal Republic of Germany including West Berlin in 1975 were tested for resistance to tetracyclines, ampicillin, chloramphenicol, kanamycin, gentamycin, furazolidone, nitrofurazone, and trimethoprim. 11.4% of the strains tested were resistant to one or several of the above mentioned substances. The proportion of the resistant strains amounted to 36.0% for S. typhimurium, and 4.3% for S. typhimurium var. copenhagen, as well as 70% for S. dublin. 79.4% of all resistant strains belonged to these types. For S. panama, the proportion of resistant strains decreased to 6.7%. Out of 291 resistant strains found, resistance determinants were present in 89.0% to tetracyclines, 47.0% to chloramphenicol, 28.5% to ampicillin, 24.1% to kanamycin, and 4.1% to furazolidone. Resistance determinants to gentamycin, nitro-furazone, and trimethoprim did not occur, 81.1% of the strains transmitted resistance determinants to E. coli K-12. A transmission of resistance to furazolidone could not be demonstrated. The different serotypes exhibited clear-cut differences in their resistance patterns.
