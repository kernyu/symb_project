The in vitro antibacterial activity of sulbenicillin was evaluated against multiresistant strains isolated from in-patients and compared with that of carbenicillin and piperacillin. Sulbenicillin resulted in being as active as the other drugs against the strains tested, both at different pH, and at different bacterial inocula. In the time-kill tests sulbenicillin demonstrated bactericidal activity similar to that of piperacillin, and a higher killing rate when compared with that of carbenicillin.
