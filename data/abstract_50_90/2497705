Broth microdilution was compared with agar dilution to test the susceptibilities of 170 clinical isolates of Neisseria gonorrhoeae to several antimicrobial agents. Percents agreement between the two methods within 1 doubling dilution were 98.8% for enoxacin, 94.3% for penicillin G, 93.5% for spectinomycin, and 98.4% for ceftriaxone.
