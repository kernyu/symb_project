Genotypic and phenotypic diversity among 16 penicillin G-resistant (Penr) isolates of Neisseria meningitidis recovered from human blood or cerebrospinal fluid in Spain was compared with that among 12 penicillin-susceptible (Pens) isolates by the use of multilocus enzyme electrophoresis, serotyping, auxotroph testing in chemically defined media, and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). Thirteen distinctive multilocus enzyme genotypes (electrophoretic types [ETs] ) were identified among the 28 isolates. There was slightly less genetic diversity among the eight ETs of Penr isolates (H = 0.385) than among the eight ETs of Pens isolates (H = 0.431). Cluster analysis demonstrated two distinctive complexes of ETs and one ET that was not closely related to either complex. The possibility of a singular clonal origin of penicillin G-resistant isolates was excluded by the observations that resistance occurred in isolates of each of the two distantly related complexes of ETs, that three of the four ETs represented by multiple isolates included both susceptible and resistant strains, and that serotypes and growth requirements were not associated with the resistance phenotype. The 28 isolates showed a relatively homogeneous pattern of four PBPs, with apparently reduced penicillin G binding by PBP 3 of the Penr isolates.
