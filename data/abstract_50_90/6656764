Eleven independent lines of Syrian hamster cells were selected by using very low levels of N-(phosphonacetyl)-L-aspartate (PALA), an inhibitor of aspartate transcarbamylase. The protocol employed insured that each resistant cell arose during one of the last divisions before selection was applied. Cells of each mutant line contained an amplification of the structural gene for CAD, a trifunctional protein which includes aspartate transcarbamylase and two other enzymes of UMP biosynthesis. Strikingly, despite the minimal selection employed, the degree of amplification of the CAD gene was 6 to 10 times the normal diploid number in all 11 cases. In situ hybridization indicated that the amplified CAD genes were almost always present at a single chromosomal site in each line. Therefore, one of the two alleles was amplified 11- to 19-fold. The rates at which cells became resistant to PALA, determined by fluctuation analysis, were 100 times less dependent on drug concentration than were the frequencies of resistant cells in steady-state populations. The relatively shallow dependence of this rate upon PALA concentration is consistent with our independent observation that most events gave rise to a similar degree of amplification. In six of six cell lines examined, the levels of CAD mRNA and aspartate transcarbamylase activity were elevated two- to fourfold. These lines were resistant to PALA concentrations 20- to 80-fold higher than the ones used for selection. The organization of amplified DNA was examined by hybridizing Southern blots with cloned DNA fragments containing amplified sequences, previously isolated from two cell lines resistant to high levels of PALA. A contiguous region of DNA approximately 44 kilobases long which included the CAD gene was amplified in five of five single-step mutants examined. Outside this region, these mutants shared amplified sequences with only one of the two highly resistant lines.
