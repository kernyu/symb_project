A cell line, C100, resistant to 225 microM compactin, has been isolated which overproduces 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase approximately 100-fold compared to the parental cell line [E. Hardeman, H. Jenke and R. Simoni (1983) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 80, 1516-1520]. It is demonstrated that the overproduction of HMG-CoA reductase in these cells is the result of increased enzyme synthesis due to elevated levels of translatable mRNA. Furthermore, the apparent molecular weight of the in vitro translation product is 94,000, which agrees with the molecular weight of the in vivo synthesized HMG-CoA reductase protomer in C100 cells. However, a comparison of the Staphylococcus aureus V8 proteolysis patterns between the in vitro and in vivo translation products reveals structural differences which suggests in vivo post-translation modification(s). It is also demonstrated unequivocally, by comparing proteolytic cleavage patterns and pulse-chase experiments, that the previously reported 63,000-, 52,000-, and 38,000-Da polypeptides recognized by HMG-CoA reductase antiserum derive from the 94,000-Da protomer as a result of nonphysiological proteolysis. Finally, the types of regulatory mechanisms involved in both the induction and repression of the enzyme in the presence or absence of compactin were determined. Four biochemical parameters of HMG-CoA reductase were examined in variant and parental cells grown in the presence and absence of compactin: enzymatic activity, degradation rate, synthesis rate, and concentration of translatable mRNA. These studies revealed that changes in cellular HMG-CoA reductase content are a function of concurrent changes in the rates of enzyme degradation and synthesis. Changes in enzyme synthesis are due to alterations in the level of translatable mRNA.
