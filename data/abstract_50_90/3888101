Forty-three hospitalized patients were treated with a new antibiotic combination containing ticarcillin plus the beta-lactamase inhibitor, clavulanic acid, in a fixed combination for intravenous use. A variety of infections were treated, including pneumonia, bacteremia, urinary tract infection, and osteomyelitis. Of 50 episodes of infection in 43 patients, 44 clinical cures were obtained, with 5 patients improving and 1 patient failing to respond to treatment. In vitro susceptibility testing of 101 clinical isolates was notable for the rarity of resistance to the combination antibiotic. Of specific interest, all 14 isolates of Staphylococcus aureus were susceptible to ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid, whereas only 2 of the 14 isolates were susceptible to ticarcillin alone. Adverse reactions to the study drug were minimal; eosinophilia, unaccompanied by other allergic phenomena, and oral candidiasis were most frequent. Overall, the combination of ticarcillin with the beta-lactamase inhibitor, clavulanic acid, appears to be a safe and effective drug for the treatment of infections caused by susceptible organisms.
