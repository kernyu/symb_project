The efficiency of transformation of pneumococcus and a strain of viridans streptococcus (strain D) to streptomycin resistance is influenced by the species in which the mutation to resistance occurred, as well as by the species in which the mutated gene has been replicated. Pneumococcus and streptococcus strain D transform in higher frequency with DNA that has been replicated in bacteria of the same species than with DNA from the heterologous species. However, the difference between the frequencies of interspecific and intraspecific transformation is much greater with pneumococcus as receptor than with streptococcus. In addition pneumococcus transforms in higher frequency with wholly homologous (pneumococcal) DNA than with DNA from pneumococci that have replicated the streptococcal Sm(r) gene. Pneumococcus is transformed in lower frequency by wholly heterologous (streptococcal) DNA than by DNA from streptococci that have replicated the pneumococcal Sm(r) gene. Streptococcus behaves similarly in that wholly homologous (streptococcal) DNA transforms it more efficiently than when the transforming fragment contains a pneumococcal moiety. Streptococcus is transformed in the same or lower frequency by wholly heterologous (pneumococcal) DNA than by DNA from pneumococci that have replicated the streptococcal Sm(r) gene. When erythromycin resistance was used as genetic marker instead of streptomycin resistance, similar results were found.
