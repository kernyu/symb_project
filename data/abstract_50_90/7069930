A clinical trial with a special emphasis on anaerobic infections was designed for evaluation of the efficacy, safety, and patient tolerance of cefoxitin. Of the 35 patients who clinically evaluated, 19 had intrareproductive organ infections, 8 had extrareproductive organ infections and 8 had urinary tract infections. Twenty-nine out of the 35 (82.9%) responded satisfactorily to therapy with cefoxitin. The daily dose of cefoxitin for the 35 adult patients (ages ranged from 17 to 62 years) were 1--6 g. There were no adverse systemic reactions, nor was any renal or hematologic toxicity noted. Antibacterial activity tests demonstrated that cefoxitin was active against anaerobic bacteria, especially Bacteroides fragilis. Cefoxitin is thought to be the drug of choice in the treatment of obstetric and gynecologic infections.
