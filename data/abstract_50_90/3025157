The emerging field of antiviral sensitivity testing must depend upon some of the lessons learned from prior experience with anti-bacterial sensitivity testing, but also take into account additional factors including intracellular drug distribution and metabolism as well as the unique features of viral replication. There is an urgent need to standardise in-vitro sensitivity testing, and an international collaborative study is essential so that different laboratories may compare and define their sensitivity results in the context of the outcome of therapy in infected patients. It is only by such a study that the influence of patient and therapeutic factors such as immune function, anatomical location of the infection and dosage regimens used can be understood.
