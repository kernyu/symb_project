Two variants have been isolated from the cultured human cell line VA2-B which are resistant in vivo to the mitochondrial-specific fluorescent dyes rhodamine 6G and rhodamine 123. Both mutants are cross-resistant to ethidium bromide but are sensitive to both colchicine and chloramphenicol. When either mutant is treated with low levels of rhodamine 6G, mitochondrial-associated fluorescence is significantly lower than in wild-type cells. Furthermore, when cell cultures are treated with high concentrations of either rhodamine 123 or 6G, and then washed free of the dye, mitochondrial-associated rhodamine fluorescence rapidly diminishes in the parental cell line. In hybrid cell fusions between resistant and sensitive cell lines, rhodamine resistance is gradually expressed, reaching maximal expression approximately 11 days after fusion. Cytoplasmic transmission of rhodamine resistance has not been clearly demonstrated in cytoplast-cell fusions, and thus resistance is probably due to a mutation of a nuclear, rather than mitochondrial DNA gene(s). These observations indicate that mitochondria of both rhodamine-resistant variants, unlike wild type, have a significantly decreased ability to bind and retain rhodamine, and thus their mitochondrial tramsmembrane electrical potential may be significantly reduced.
