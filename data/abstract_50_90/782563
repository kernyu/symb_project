An antibody specific to a cephalosporinase responsible for the resistance of bacteria to cephalosporines has been immobilized on agarose beads by the iminocarbonate method. The resin thus obtained has been studied at a biospecific point of view. Its high thermostability is also demonstrated. This biospecific resin allows the performance of epidemiologic experiments of bacteria resistant to beta lactamines.
