We used an intersecting pool strategy to recognize chimeric plasmids containing Chinese hamster ribosomal protein cDNAs. The screening procedure involved hybridization-selection of messenger RNAs, cell-free translation of selected mRNAs, and electrophoresis of polypeptide products on one- and two-dimensional polyacrylamide gels. The protocol was designed to recognize ribosomal protein S14 cDNAs specifically. Of 500 chimeric plasmids screened, two possessed cDNAs complementary to S14 mRNA and 18 contained sequences complementary to other ribosomal protein messages. Previously we demonstrated that mutations affecting Chinese hamster ovary cell ribosomal protein S14 are responsible for genetic resistance to the translational inhibitor emetine (emt b). Because emetine-resistant mutant and wild type Chinese hamster ovary cells elaborate mRNAs that encode electrophoretically distinguishable forms of S14 protein, we were able to identify S14 cDNA clones unambiguously. The data described here indicate that: 1) clone pCS14-1 contains most, if not all, of the S14 coding sequence as a cDNA; 2) S14 mRNA is approximately 0.01% of a Chinese hamster cell's polyadenylated messenger RNA; and 3) genomic DNA-encoding ribosomal protein S14 is a low, perhaps single, copy sequence with a complex structure, including several, long intervening sequences.
