Various aspects of the cephalosporin antibiotics are reviewed, including mode of action and mechanisms of bacterial resistance, antibacterial activity, clinical pharmacology, adverse reactions, and therapeutic use. There are no important therapeutic differences between the two oral agents, cephalexin and cephradine. For intramuscular injection, cephaloridine has largely been replaced by cefazolin which is equally well tolerated and not as nephrotoxic; further, cefazolin has a relatively long half-life which permits its administration three or four times daily. There are no substantial therapeutic differences among the cephalosporins most commonly used intravenously--cephalothin, cefazolin and cephapirin. However, cefazolin is administered in a lower dosage and somewhat less frequently.
