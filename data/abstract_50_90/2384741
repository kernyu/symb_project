Four, NAD-independent, clinical isolates of Haemophilus parainfluenzae were recovered from a genital ulcer, a purulent skin lesion, a sputum specimen and a throat swab respectively. With the exception of NAD requirement, the strains exhibited the biochemical characteristics of H. parainfluenzae biotype II. The genetic relationship between these isolates and a standard strain of H. parainfluenzae was determined by testing transforming activities of two chromosomal markers, streptomycin resistance and nalidixic acid resistance. The clinical isolates were efficient donors and recipients in transformation. In addition, we demonstrated transfer of the genes conferring NAD independence to typical, NAD-requiring H. parainfluenzae and Haemophilus influenzae strains.
