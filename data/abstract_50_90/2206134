Cycloheximide-ribosome interactions from sensitive and resistant organisms were studied by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic techniques. The two methyl resonances of cycloheximide upon interaction with ribosomes from Saccharomyces cerevisiae showed preferential broadening. Comparison of cycloheximide line broadening as effected by ribosomes from S. cerevisiae (sensitive) and Microsporum canis (resistant) revealed that less cycloheximide is bound to the M. canis ribosomes. From the decrease in line broadening observed with increasing temperature it may be concluded that cycloheximide-ribosome interaction is a fast exchange reaction. Tetracycline did not compete with cycloheximide for binding site(s) on the ribosomes of S. cerevisiae.
