Infection of human adult and neonatal mononuclear leukocytes (MNLs) with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) caused significant inhibition of lymphoproliferation in response to various mitogens (heat-killed Staphylococcus aureus, phytohaemagglutinin, concanavalin-A and pokeweed mitogen). Antibody to human interferon-gamma enhanced the RSV-induced suppression of lymphoproliferation in adult, but not neonatal MNLs. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that RSV can suppress the development of a cell-mediated immune response by direct interaction with lymphocytes, and at least in adult cells, interferon-gamma could be implicated in resistance to this action.
