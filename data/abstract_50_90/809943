Effects of a new antimicrobial agent sisomicin on microorganisms isolated from pathologic material (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella spp., Streptococcus pyogenes-B, Citrobacter Freundii) were studied. The results obtained were compared with another two aminoglycoside antibiotics - gentamicin and tobramycin. All three antibiotics were found to be very effective in vitro; their effect was enhanced by addition of an antibiotic of the penicillin group (carbenicillin, suncillin) or an antibiotic of the tetracyklin series (oxytetracyklin, doxycyklin). All three preparations were tested on 26 Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains. Tobramycin inhibited growth of 22 strains and thus presented the highest level of efficiency among these deoxystreptamin preparations.
