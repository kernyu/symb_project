The resistance to formaldehyde of several facultatively methylotrophic bacteria has been investigated. The MIC-values were in the range of formaldehyde concentrations used for preservation purposes. The resistance could be explained partly by the action of aldehyde dehydrogenase found in two of the strains and by the development of a penetration barrier by the cell envelopes described formerly.
