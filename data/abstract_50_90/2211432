The influence of cefotaxime 1000 mg given intravenously bd on microbial colonization resistance was investigated in six healthy volunteers. Administration of cefotaxime allowed colonization of the bowel by a resistant challenge strain of Enterobacter cloacae in all volunteers. The faecal concentration of aerobic flora increased significantly in five of six volunteers. In one the numbers of Gram-negative bacilli, enterococci and yeasts also increased. In the other four the faecal concentration of enterococci and yeasts increased, but Gram-negative bacilli did not rise above pre-treatment level. It is concluded that cefotaxime impairs colonization resistance, although to a variable degree. Therefore the term 'selective decontamination' is not fully justified for prophylactic regimens that include cefotaxime.
