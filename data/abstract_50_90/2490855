We have evaluated 283 consecutive hospital acquired urinary tract infections (HAUTI) in a University hospital (incidence 5.6% of admissions). In females, spontaneous, symptomatic and younger patient infections predominated, while in males HAUTI were mostly asymptomatic, after catheterization and in elderly patients. Chronic nonfatal diseases--particularly neurologic disease and diabetes--, old age, previous antibiotic use, the postoperative period, and cancer were the major general predisposing factors, mostly because they involved urological procedures. There was an urethral catheter in 78% of cases, with questionable indication or maintenance in 37%. In 65% of cases there were clinical data attributable to HAUTI; however, on strict criteria only 5% of pyelonephritis and 24% of cystitis were detected. Mortality rate was 0.4%. Etiology was E. coli in 29%, Proteus in 13%, Enterobacter in 12%, enterococcus in 11.5%, Serratia in 7%, Pseudomonas in 6.5%, and Klebsiella in 6.5%. There were differences regarding endogenous and hospital flora on the basis of sex, hospital situation, catheterization, mobility, and previous duration of hospitalization. The microbial resistance pattern was high in the hospital flora. The major therapeutical problem was the high number of unnecessary treatments representing the automatic medical response to the finding of a positive urine culture.
