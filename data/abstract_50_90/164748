A study was made of 111 strains of plasma-negative spathylococci isolated from the blood, pleural fluid, urine, and exudate of the abdominal cavity of 30 patients. The studies were carried out by 18 criteria. A variety of biological properties and signs characteristic of pathogenic staphylococci (hemolytic activity, anaerobic splitting of mannite, the presence of phosphatase, lysozyme, protease, alpha-toxin, fibrinolysin) were noted. A high resistance to tetracycline and penicillin was found in the strains isolated from the blood and the pleural cavity.
