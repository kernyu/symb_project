Timentin proved to be highly effective in the treatment of 70 urological patients suffering from complicated urinary tract infections. There were few adverse effects, and development of resistance was not observed. Surgical treatment was possible in each case, without any septic complications. The results show that Timentin is a very useful drug for the urologist who often treats complicated urinary tract infections, especially because of its low re- and super-infection rate and the absence of development of resistance.
