Three hundred and fifteen subgingival isolates were tested for their susceptibility to a mouthwash containing 0.2% chlorhexidine. The majority of strains tested were susceptible at high dilution although some strains of S. mitior, S. sanguis, and Capnocytophaga were relatively resistant. It was concluded that, on the basis of these in vitro results, the mouthwash should have potential for subgingival use in the treatment of chronic periodontitis.
