Examination of the uterus cavity microflora in 50 patients with endometritis post abortum revealed that the etiology of endometritis post abortum was polymicrobial and its development was mainly due to aerobic and anaerobic microbial associations. By the isolation frequency enterococci predominated among the aerobic organisms and bacteriods and fusobacteria predominated among the anaerobic organisms. All the pathogens isolated from the uterus cavity were characterized by polyresistance to antimicrobial drugs. The aerobic bacteria were often resistant to the antibiotics active against the anaerobic organisms which required the use of combined antibacterial therapy in some cases.
