The kidney of anaesthetised pigs was perfused in situ with carotid arterial blood. Renal blood flow and perfusion pressure were recorded. Close intra-arterial injection of leukotriene (LT) C4, D4 or noradrenaline (NA) caused a dose-related increase in vascular resistance. Both LTs were more active than NA by one to two orders of magnitude. Systemically-administered indomethacin potentiated the effect of all three agonists. Incubation of renal artery tissue with calcium ionophore A23187 in the presence of indomethacin resulted in the generation of LT-like material which, when assayed on guinea-pig ileum, was indistinguishable from LTD4. The results show that pig renal vessels produce LT-like material and suggest that the potent vasoconstriction induced by exogenous NA and LTs is modulated in vivo by a vasodilator cyclo-oxygenase product.
