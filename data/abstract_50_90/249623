The in vivo activities of cefsulodin, sulbenicillin, and gentamicin were compared in mice infected intraperitoneally with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In mice infected with sulbenicillin- and gentamicin-susceptible strains, cefsulodin was about 12 to 60 times more active than sulbenicillin and had an activity similar to gentamicin. In mice, the activity of cefsulodin was independent whether the strains were resistant to gentamicin or not, but it was considerably affected by resistance of the strains to sulbenicillin.
