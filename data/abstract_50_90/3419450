Pretreatment of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) or H4 (rat hepatoma) cells with low non-toxic doses of H2O2 or xanthine-xanthine oxidase renders the cells more resistant to the toxic effect of H2O2 and gamma-rays. This increased resistance is observed both in exponentially growing and in plateau-phase cells. Cells pretreated with xanthine-xanthine oxidase are less mutated than control cultures when challenged with ionizing radiation. The number of DNA single-strand breaks (measured by nucleoid sedimentation) induced by a high dose of gamma-rays or H2O2 is lower in cells pretreated with xanthine-xanthine oxidase compared to control cultures. However, the pretreatment does not modify the rate of DNA single-strand breaks rejoining in cells challenged with H2O2 or gamma-rays. The catalase activity is not modified in pretreated cells, but the superoxide dismutase activity is increased about 2-fold.
