The streptococcal transposon Tn917 was demonstrated to transpose in Escherichia coli from the Bacillus subtilis-E. coli shuttle plasmid pHK1207 into an F' plasmid derivative. Subsequently, a second round of transposition from the F' plasmid into pACYC184 could be readily demonstrated. These results represent the initial demonstration of the transposition of a gram-positive transposon in a gram-negative bacterium at a relatively high frequency.
