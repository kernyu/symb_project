The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC's) of penicillin, ampicillin, tetracycline, erythromycin, spectinomycin and sulfadiazine were determined for 732 isolates of Neisseria gonorrhoeae collected in 1973-74. Comparison of the results of this survey with data from other Canadian studies showed that the percentage of isolates resistant to tetracycline had not changed since 1966, but that the percentage of erythromycin-resistant isolates had decreased. After an initial increase in 1966 the percentage of penicillin-resistant isolates stabilized. Spectinomycin-resistant isolates were not found. Positive correlations were observed between the MICs of the antibiotics tested; the highest positive correlations were between penicillin and ampicillin and between penicillin and tetracycline. A positive correlation was also noted between penicillin resistance and increasing spectinomycin MICs. Finally, a significant seasonal variation in MICs was found, the trend being towards increasing MICs during the summer.
