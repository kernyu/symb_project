The compatibility groups of eleven plasmids determining metabolic characters used in taxonomy and isolated from naturally-occurring strains were examined. Seven of these plasmids determined lactose fermentation. Two were fi+: one of these belonged to group FI and the other to a novel group. Of the remainder, which were fi-, one (which also determined chloramphenicol resistance) belonged to group H; the others were compatible with representative plasmids from every group so far recognized. Two plasmids determined sucrose fermentation. Both were fi-: one belonged to group H, the other was compatible with plasmids of every group. Two plasmids determined haemolysin production. One was fi+ and belonged to group FIII; the other was fi- and belonged to group I2. Plasmids belonging to known compatibility groups and determining metabolic characters only should prove particularly useful in the classification of plasmids determining antibiotic resistance.
