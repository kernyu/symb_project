The optimum conditions for the induction of mutants resistant to antibiotics in Brevibacterium flavum ATCC 14067 were determined. UV irradiation at the energy fluence of 6.5 kJ/m2 and N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (1 mg/mL) at pH 6.0 were used for the induction of mutants. Mutant strains resistant to rifampicin, oleandomycin, streptomycin and erythromycin were prepared.
