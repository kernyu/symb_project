Since pyrazinamide (PZA) has had a come-back in therapy of tuberculosis a simple and reliable method for sensitivity tests has been necessary. A comparison of resistance tests to PZA in acid Lowenstein-Jensen-medium and in fluid medium with those to nicotinamide (NSA) showed a clear superiority of the NSA method, recommended by BRANDER. Also in routine sensitivity tests the use of NSA instead of PZA has stood the test. Another advantage of the method is the possibility to integrate it in the simplified proportion method without any additional work.
