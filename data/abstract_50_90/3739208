Resistance to halofuginone has been developed by serially passaging the Houghton strain of Eimeria tenella in chickens medicated with progressively greater concentrations of drug. Attempts to develop resistance to 3 ppm (as recommended for use by the manufacturer) or higher concentrations, by the method of Weppelman et al., were unsuccessful.
