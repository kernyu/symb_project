Studies on the antibacterial activity, absorption and excretion and also clinical investigation in the field of pediatrics have been carried out with cefotiam (SCE-963, CTM), a new cephalosporin antibiotic. 1) The MICs of CTM against the following clinical isolates were measured and compared with those of CEZ: S. aureus (81 strains), E. coli (27) and K. pneumoniae (27), with CTM being inferior by 1 tube in S. aureus, being superior by 2 to 3 tubes in E. coli and by about 2 - 3 tubes in K. pneumoniae. 2) Absorption and excretion. After intravenous one shot injection at dose levels of 10 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg, the peak in the serum concentration was shown in the 15-minute value with 18.1 and 36.6 mcg/ml for 10 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg, respectively. The half-life in ;the serum was 1.14 and 0.61 hours, respectively. In the case of 1-hour intravenous drip infusion at a dose level of 10 mg/kg, it was 14.3 mcg/ml, with 0.98-hour half-life in the serum. The recovery rates from the urine within 0 to 6 hours were 50.6% and 66.2% in the case of intravenous one shot injection at dose levels of 10 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg, respectively, with 71.1% in the case of the 1-hour intravenous drip infusion. 3) Two to 3 hours after intravenous one shot injection of CTM in H. influenzae-meningitis every 4 hours at a dose level of 62.5 mg/kg at one time, the cerebrospinal fluid concentration of CTM was only 2.12 to 10.0 mcg/ml, and this fact suggests that CTM is a useful cephalosporin for treating purulent meningitis. 4) CTM was administered in 19 clinical cases, with the results being: excellent in 4 out of 4 cases of bronchitis; excellent in 5 and good in 1 out of 6 cases of pneumonia; excellent in 3 cases of pyelitis; good in purulent parotitis, purulent meningitis and bacterial pericarditis; and excellent in peritonsillar abscess, purulent osteomyelitis and staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome (S.S.S.S.). No side effects have been observed in all cases. As for abnormal laboratory findings, 3 cases of eosinophilia were seen.
