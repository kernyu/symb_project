A mutant of Escherichia coli with increased sensitivity to streptomycin has been studied. This strain differed from a normal str(s) strain in that streptomycin produced inhibition of protein synthesis and loss of viability with almost no lag period. Chloramphenicol protected a normal str(s) strain but not the mutant against the bactericidal action of streptomycin. The results obtained support the idea that access of streptomycin to its site of action in a normal cell is restricted, and that this restriction, which is much less effective in the mutant, probably involves a permeability barrier. Comparison of the inhibition of protein synthesis by streptomycin with concomitant changes in the distribution of polyribosomes in both strains suggested that the antibiotic can directly inhibit the translation of mRNA.
