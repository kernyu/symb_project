Mouse Mx protein, an interferon (IFN)-induced nuclear protein, confers selective resistance to influenza virus. We show here that, as with influenza virus-resistant Mx+ mouse embryo cells, influenza virus mRNA accumulation and protein synthesis are strongly inhibited in rat embryo cells treated with IFN-alpha/beta. IFN-alpha/beta induced in rat cells the synthesis of Mx-related mRNAs migrating on Northern (RNA) gels as two bands of about 3.5 and 2.5 kilobases which directed the synthesis of three electrophoretically distinct proteins called rat Mx proteins 1, 2, and 3. The three rat proteins were antigenically related to the mouse Mx protein but differed in molecular weight and intracellular location. Rat Mx protein 1 was found predominantly in the nucleus and, on the basis of several criteria, resembled the nuclear mouse Mx protein. It was induced by IFN-alpha/beta in all 28 inbred rat strains tested. Rat Mx proteins 2 and 3 differed from protein 1 at the carboxy terminus and were predominantly cytoplasmic like the human Mx homolog. Sequence data of partial cDNA clones indicate that three Mx-related genes, rather than one, exist in the rat.
