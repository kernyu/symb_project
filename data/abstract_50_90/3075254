In this study 200 E. coli strains were isolated and identified from 95 fecal, 96 urinary and 9 vaginal specimens. The pathogenic species isolated from feces were 61.05% of all identified E. coli strains. This percentage was 26.04% for urinary specimens. The distribution of E. coli serotypes was determined. Mostly E. coli O111 K58 B4 strain was isolated from the pathological materials such as 20% in feces, 12.5% in urine, 11.11% in vaginal secretions. The sex distribution of isolated E. coli strains from urine was 77.08% for female patients and 22.92% male patients. We can say that E. coli species which have been isolated and identified from pathological materials are susceptible to seftriaxon 73.5% and sefotaxime 72.5%, but they have been readily gaining resistance against gentamicin and nalidixic acid. Broad spectrum antibiotics and chemotherapeutic agents are widely used in the treatment of E. coli infections. However medical therapy doesn't always produce good result. Because E. coli strains have been gaining resistance to chemotherapeutic agents and antibiotics. So, it is suggested that the most effective antibiotic should be determined by antibiogram and used.
