Twenty four strains of Shigella were isolated from the stool of patients who had been admitted to the hospital with the complaint of diarrhea. Of these, 17 were found to be Sh. flexneri, and 7 Sh. boydii. Antibiotic susceptibility tests indicated that all of the 24 isolates probably had multiple resistance factors. Twenty three of 24 strains were found to be resistant to ampicillin. This may be important from a therapeutic point of view.
