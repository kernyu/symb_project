Laboratory and clinical studies of CFX were conducted on 30 pediatric inpatients at the Department of Pediatrics of Mie University. The results of the sensitivity evaluation conducted on 37 clinical isolates consisting of 16 species were in accordance with the findings reported hitherto in the literature, i.e., CFX was superior to CEZ and CET in terms of the growth inhibitory effect against Gram-negative rods. The serum peak level was obtained 5 minutes after an intravenous injection of 25 mg/kg, and 15 minutes after a drip infusion of 30 minutes using the same dose. The average terminal half life was 13 minutes 15 seconds for the former and 20 minutes for the latter. Clinical evaluation was made on a total of 22 eligible patients. The results were classified as follows: Excellent in 4 cases, good in 12, fair in 4 and poor in 2. The effective rate of CFX was 72.7%. Side effects observed were vascular pain, rash and vomiting, all of which were mild in nature and disappeared immediately after discontinuation of, or change in the routine of drug administration.
