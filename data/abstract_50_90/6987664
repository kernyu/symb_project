The Escherichia coli R factor-derived chloramphenicol resistance (camr) gene is functionally expressed in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. the gene was introduced by transformation into yeast cells as part of a chimeric plasmid, pYT11-LEU2, constructed in vitro. The plasmide vector consists of the E. coli plasmid pBR325 (carrying the camr gene), the yeast 2-micron DNA plasmid, and the yeast LEU2 structural gene. Yeast cells harboring pYT11-LEU2 acquire resistance to chloramphenicol and cell-free extracts prepared from such cells contain chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (acetyl-CoA: chloramphenicol 3-O-acetyltransferase, EC 2.3.1.28), the enzyme specified by the camr gene in E. coli. Resistance to chloramphenicol and the presence of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity segregate with the yeast marker LEU2, carried by the transforming plasmid, during both mitotic growth and meiotic division.
