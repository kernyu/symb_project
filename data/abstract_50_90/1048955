The results of antimicrobial susceptibility testing on 262 strains of Pasteurella multocida and 141 strains of Pasteurella haemolytica isolated from cattle and swine from 1971 to 1974 were analyzed for patterns of resistance to streptomycin, penicillin, tetracycline, and chloramphenicol, using a modified Kirby-Bauer procedure. Resistance was recorded for 80.5% of the isolants of P multocida and 92.2% of those of P haemolytica. Resistance to streptomycin was most frequent, followed by resistance to penicillin and tetracycline. Most cultures of P multocida and P haemolytica were susceptible to chloramphenicol. There were 9 patterns of resistance with the aforementioned antibiotics. The combinations, streptomycin and penicillin and streptomycin and tetracycline, each accounted for approximately 10% of the resistance patterns of P multocida. Approximately half of the 14 isolants of P haemolytica were resistant to the combination of streptomycin, penicillin, and tetracycline. These observations underscore the need for antimicrobial susceptibility testing of clinical isolants of P multocida and P haemolytica.
