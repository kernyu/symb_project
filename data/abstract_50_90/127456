The efficacy of hemagglutinin containing preparations of vaccinia virus in eliciting skin immunity and hemagglutination inhibiting antibodies has been studied in guinea pigs, rabbits and monkeys. The preparations, grown on chorioallantoic membranes from chick embryos, have been tested both in the form of live vaccine and after inactivation with ethyl alcohol and beta-propiolactone. Statistical analysis of the results, comprising data from 200 guinea pigs, 80 rabbits and 100 monkeys, shows that there is a strong correlation between hemagglutination inhibiting antibodies and skin resistance, both when the anti-hemagglutinin is produced in response to live as well as inactivated vaccinia virus.
