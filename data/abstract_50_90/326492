An open comparative study was carried out to assess the effectiveness of 4 antibiotic regimens in eradicating acute bacterial infections of the upper respiratory tract. Patients in each treatment group had similar physical parameters, severity of disease and bacterial pathogens, and were treated for 10 days with either erythromycin estolate, erythromycin stearate, ampicillin or oxytetracycline in the recommended dosage. Each patient was reviewed daily by physical examination and the bacteriological findings from throat swab and salivary washings. The results showed that erythromycin stearate produced more rapid bacterial eradication and clinical resolution of symptoms and fever than with the other antibiotic preparations, and was well tolerated by most patients.
