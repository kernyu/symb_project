Dioxidine sensitivity of 7291 strains of aerobic bacteria and 163 strains of anaerobic bacteria was assayed with the disk diffusion method. The sensitivity of the aerobes was studied in the time course from 1984 to 1988. It was shown that during the 5-year period, the sensitivity of gram-positive bacteria to dioxidine gradually decreased. At the same time no increase in resistance of gram-negative organisms to dioxidine was observed. A high dioxidine sensitivity of obligate anaerobes, i.e. Clostridium spp., Bacteroides spp., Fusobacterium spp., anaerobic cocci and others was demonstrated.
