A first comparative in vitro study of Cefotaxime and Ceftriaxone activities on thirteen species of Algerian bacteria is done. These two third generation Cephalosporins have the same activity. A second comparative study of two Quinolones (Pefloxacin, Norfloxacin ) and a Penicillin (Imipenem) is done. Imipenem give satisfying results and is very stable against beta lactamases. In vitro Norfloxacin has a better activity than Pefloxacin.
