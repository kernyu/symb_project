The role of splenic macrophages in resistance to lethal Plasmodium berghei or self-limiting Plasmodium yoelii was studied by testing their rate of phagocytosis and their production of O2 metabolites (H2O2 and O2-) upon nonspecific stimulation with zymosan. It was found that, compared with P. berghei, infection of mice with P. yoelii resulted in an earlier appearance and in higher numbers of adherent cells in the spleen. Furthermore, the capacity of macrophages to generate O2 metabolites was significantly higher in P. yoelii- than in P. berghei-infected mice. This difference in the production of O2 metabolites was more pronounced when calculated on a per spleen basis. On the other hand, phagocytosis by macrophages was similar in both types of infection. The data suggest that lethal and nonlethal malaria species differ in their capacity to induce the production of O2 metabolites by macrophages, thereby influencing the final course of disease.
