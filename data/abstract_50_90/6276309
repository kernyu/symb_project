Ketoconazole (100 mg, orally, once daily) was investigated in nine patients with extensive dermatophyte infections. After treatment ranging between one week and three months, clinical cures (healing of lesions and negative cultures) were observed in all cases. In vitro growth of Trichophyton rubrum, T. mentagrophytes, and T. verrucosum isolated from infected skin scales were completely inhibited by concentrations of ketoconazole of 10 microgram/ml and above. No evidence for the development of drug resistance was obtained from regular in vitro sensitivity tests.
