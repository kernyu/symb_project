Erythrocytes from protein-energy malnourished children have been shown to have increased resistance to osmotic lysis (4). Osmotic fragility studies were carried out in protein-energy malnourished rats and A23187-induced changes in osmotic fragility were studied in rat and human erythrocytes. Rat erythrocytes were found to be much more sensitive to A23187 effect on osmotic fragility as compared to the human erythrocytes. Erythrocytes from protein-deficient rats but not from the energy-restricted rats showed increased resistance to osmotic lysis. A23187 (+ Ca)-induced changes in osmotic fragility were not different between control and experimental erythrocytes, either for humans or rats. There was, however, a difference in the extent to which Na accumulation and K depletion occurred in erythrocytes from control and experimental animals after A23187 + Ca2+ treatment.
