Five R plasmids transferred from Asian strains of Vibrio cholerae all proved to be members of compatibility group C. A non-self-transmissible plasmid, stable in V. cholerae, was mobilized for transfer to Escherichia coli K-12 and found to be unstably inherited in that host. Plasmids of group C and P transferred to a wild V. cholerae strain were stably inherited.
