Genetic analysis and molecular characterization of plasmid deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) was performed in a toxigenic isolate of Staphylococcus aureus strain DU4916. Elimination, transduction, and transformation experiments provided us with a series of derivatives similar except for the presence or absence of genes mediating resistance to penicillin (penr), methicillin (mecr), and tetracycline (tetr) and enterotoxin type B (SEB) production (entB+). The derivatives were examined for the presence of a plasmid species which encodes for SEB production. Two distinct species of covalently closed circular DNA of about 2.8 X 10(6) and 0.75 X 10(6) daltons were identified in an ethidium bromide-cured, penicillinase-negative (pens) isolate, SN109 (mecr tetr emtB+). Further segregation of either methicillin resistance or tetracycline resistance or of both together resulted in the loss of SEB production and the disappearance of both plasmids. Transduction from strain SN109 showed that determinants for tetracycline resistance are carried by the 2.8 X 10(6) dalton plasmid. Transformation with covalently closed circular DNA from strain SN109 yielded mecs tetr entB- transformants harboring the tetracycline resistance plasmid alone and mecr tetr entB+ transformants harboring both the tetracycline resistance and the 0.75 X 10(6)-dalton plasmid. Further segregation of methicillin resistance in transformants was not associated with any change in plasmid DNA. The results indicate that a genetic determinant for SEB production is carried by the 0.75 X 10(6)-dalton plasmid. It is possible, however, that this plasmid cannot be maintained in the host independently from the tetracycline resistance plasmid. Methicillin resistance in the strains examined could not be ascribed to any of the covalently closed circular DNA components resolved in strain DU4916.
