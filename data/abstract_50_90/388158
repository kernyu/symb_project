A nonconjugative R plasmid, rMS3, whose molecular weight was 2.4 X 10(7) daltons, possessed a kanamycin resistance gene and was thermosensitive in its maintenance in Escherichia coli strains. We mobilized rMS3 with a conjugative R plasmid, R100 or T-tet, and obtained cointegrates carrying all the parental resistance markers. Various markers of the cointegrates were frequently deleted by P1 transduction and the deletion patterns among the different cointegrates were differed from each other. The cointegrates were thermoresistant, but the thermosensitive replicon could be segregated from the thermoresistant cointegrate by deletion. Some cointegrates between rMS3 and T-tet showed a derepressed state of transferability because of the integration of rMS3 and T-tet showed a derepressed state of transferability because of the integration of rMS3 into the regulator gene of the transfer loci. The genome size of the cointegrate so far tested was the sum of the sizes of the parental plasmids, indicating that the whole genome of rMS3 could integrate into various sites of the conjugative plasmids R100 and T-tet.
