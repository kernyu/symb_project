This case of chloroquine prophylaxis failure occurred in the Central African Republic, a country heretofore unaffected by chloroquine resistance. The clinical findings and chloroquine blood levels and blood smears confirmed prophylaxis failure. In vitro susceptibility testing demonstrated the parasite to be 3- to 4-fold more resistant than a susceptible reference clone.
