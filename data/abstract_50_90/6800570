Using a sample of 71 Pseudomonas aeruginosa infected burns patients admitted to the Burns Injury Unit of the Royal Brisbane Hospital within an 11-year period the pattern of sensitivity of the organism to 18 antibiotics was studied longitudinally looking at first and last cultures (either pus, blood or sputum) separately. Only 5 antibiotics reflected a significant change (towards resistance) in sensitivity patterns (chloramphenicol, gentamycin, kanamycin, tetracycline, achromycin). Six of the other 13 antibiotics showed a trend towards increasing resistance but the changes were not statistically significant (polymyxin B, carbenicillin, sulphanomides, cotrimoxazole, streptomycin, teramycin). The other 7 antibiotics showed no change, all but one (colistin) being resistant throughout.
