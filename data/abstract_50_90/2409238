Natural killer cells (NK) demonstrate cytotoxicity against a wide range of cultured cells without prior sensitization, and the sensitivity of many target cells to NK attack is altered by exposure to interferon. The structures on the target cells conferring sensitivity or resistance to NK are not known, but glycolipids are suggested to be related to NK susceptibility. To determine possible relationships between target cell glycolipids and NK cytolysis, the effects of human beta-interferon (IFN) on the neutral glycolipid composition and sensitivity to NK cytolysis of cultured cells from four human gliomas and two fetal brains were analyzed. Compared to MOLT-4 and Raji cells all six neural cell lines were quite resistant to NK, and IFN slightly increased this resistance. IFN also caused increases in the amounts of non-hydroxy fatty acid cerebroside, ceramide trihexoside, asialo-GM1, asialo-GM2 and globoside. Increased molar proportions of ceramide tri- and tetra-saccharides occurred in the two glioma lines which had the greatest increases in NK resistance following IFN exposure. It is concluded that neutral glycolipids may play a role in the mechanisms responsible for resistance of some glioma cells to NK cytolysis.
