Morphology and end product patterns were used to group 112 bacterial isolates from the ceca and colons of pigs fed unmedicated and chlortetracycline-containing diets. Most of the isolates (68%) were resistant to chlortetracycline (greater than 4 micrograms/ml). Chlortetracycline resistance was associated with all groups of anaerobic and facultative bacteria.
