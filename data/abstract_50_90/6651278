The in vitro susceptibilities of 50 strains of Salmonella spp., 80 strains of Shigella spp., and 50 enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, 14 Yersinia enterocolitica, 6 Aeromonas hydrophila, 4 Plesiomonas shigelloides, 9 Vibrio parahaemolyticus, and 30 Campylobacter jejuni strains that were recently isolated from worldwide sources were determined for 10 antimicrobial agents. The antimicrobial agents tested included ampicillin, bicozamycin, doxycycline, enoxacin (CI-919), erythromycin, furazolidone, amdinocillin, norfloxacin, trimethoprim, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Ampicillin resistance occurred frequently in strains of Salmonella and Shigella spp. and enterotoxigenic E. coli strains. The most active agents against all of the bacteria tested were enoxacin and norfloxacin. Furazolidone and amdinocillin were also highly active against the majority of strains. Trimethoprim and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole were inhibitory at low concentrations against all test except C. jejuni isolates. The in vitro results of this study confirm the high prevalence of bacterial resistance to ampicillin. However, this work also identifies four antimicrobial agents, enoxacin, furazolidone, norfloxacin, and amdinocillin, that would be appropriate for further testing in clinical trials.
