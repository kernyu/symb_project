We tested the effect of anti-sense RNA on the replication of avian retroviruses in cultured cells. The replication of a recombinant retrovirus carrying a neomycin resistance gene (neor) in the anti-sense orientation was blocked when the cells expressed high steady-state levels of RNA molecules with neor in sequence in the sense was blocked when the cells expressed high steady-state levels of RNA molecules with neor sequences in the sense orientation, i.e., complementary to the viral sequence. Viral DNA bearing neor sequences was not detected specifically in host cells where this anti-sense RNA inhibition of viral replication occurred. These observations suggest that anti-sense RNA inhibition may be a useful strategy for the inhibition of retroviral infections.
