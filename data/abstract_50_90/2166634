The bactericidal activity of daptomycin and vancomycin alone in cation-supplemented Mueller-Hinton broth and in human serum against clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Enterococcus faecalis was evaluated by exposing replicating microorganisms to concentrations ranging from 2 to 128 micrograms/ml for 24 hr. In addition, the possibility of emergence of resistance, the stability of each agent in the respective medium, and the percent of protein binding by human serum for each agent was evaluated. We found that a concentration of less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml of daptomycin was sufficient to achieve bactericidal activity (greater than or equal to 99.9% killing of the inoculum) in cation-supplemented Mueller-Hinton broth for all staphylococcal isolates tested; a concentration of less than or equal to 16 micrograms/ml of daptomycin was required for bactericidal activity in cation-supplemented Mueller-Hinton broth for enterococcal isolates. In human serum, comparable bactericidal activity with daptomycin was achieved only with concentrations 8-16 times higher. A similar but less pronounced effect in human serum was seen for vancomycin. Neither daptomycin nor vancomycin was appreciably degraded in human serum over a 24-hr period. It is likely that the clinical efficacy of daptomycin in humans would be enhanced by higher dosing than has been studied to date.
