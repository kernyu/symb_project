The in vitro activity of fosfomycin against 90 strains of methicillin- and gentamicin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus was studied in an in vitro microtitre system using Mueller-Hinton broth supplemented with glucose-6-phosphate. In parallel the antistaphylococcal activity of cefamandole, N-formimidoyl-thienamycin, clindamycin, fusidic acid and vancomycin was determined with the same organisms. The following MIC50 (MIC95) values were obtained: fosfomycin 8 (128) mg/l, cefamandole 8 (greater than 64) mg/l, clindamycin 0.25 (16) mg/l, fusidic acid less than 0.25 (less than 0.25) mg/l, vancomycin 1 (2) mg/l and N-formimidoyl-thienamycin 4 (16) mg/l. A high MIC/MBC ratio was noted for cefamandole, in contrast to fosfomycin.
