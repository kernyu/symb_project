The drug Ofloxacin was tried clinically on 54 patients with different bacterial infections. Patients resistant in vitro and in vivo to all available antibacterial drugs were selected. The patients were classified into 4 groups: 1. with uroinfections--31 patients, 2. bacterial infections in patients under prolonged immunosuppressive treatment--10 patients, 3. bacterial infections in patients with other severe diseases--4 patients, 4. patients in whom previous antibacterial treatment was unsuccessful--11 patients. The treatment was carried out with different doses and duration according to the type, localization and severity of the infection. The results were very good in 24 patients and good in 6 patients. The early (on the second day of treatment) sterilization of the urine is pointed out. The very good results in patients with suppressed immunity, the wide antibacterial and clinical range, the convenience of oral application and the minimal side effects are especially emphasized.
