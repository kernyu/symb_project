Measurement of MICs of PC-904, CBPC and GM against 135 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from patients with urinary tract infections was performed. Susceptibility to PC-904 of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was found to be 3 approximately 7 times more sensitive than that to CBPC and as same as that to GM with inoculum size of 10(8)/ml and 10(6)/ml. Serum level of PC-904 reached a peak of 38.5 microgram/ml 15 minutes after 0.5 g intravenous administration. Urinary recovery rate unit 6 hours after the administration was 12.5%. Overall clinical efficacy of 6 cases of acute simple cystitis and 3 cases of chronic complicated cystitis was judged to be 83.3% and 33.3% respectively by a criterion proposed by the UTI Committee in Japan.
