Resistance of 1060 Enterobacteria strains isolated from patients with chronic pneumonia and bronchitis was studied with respect to 15--18 antibiotics. The methods of agar dilution and sensitivity discs (Pr. mirabilis) were used. High resistance of the isolates to the antibiotics except aminoglycosides was shown. The rate, spectrum and level of the resistance were variable and changed depending on the bacterial species and drug type. The majority (77.7--100 per cent) was multiple resistant (to at least 6--10 antibiotics). The Enterobacteria populations of the respiratory origin were heterogeneous with respect to the resistance warts (61.5--85.7 per cent). The changes included elimination of the primary warts, appearance of new secondary warts or complete replacement of the variant composition. Rational therapy requires investigation of both the species and the variant composition of the microbiocenoses of the bronchial contents and their changes during the patient treatment in the hospital.
