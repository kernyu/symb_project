Xanthomonas maltophilia is a potentially pathogenic organism with a broad clinical spectrum. Nosocomial colonization and infection are the most common manifestations. The incidence of clinical isolation of X. maltophilia is on the rise, possibly in part because of the selective pressure from the new antimicrobial agents to which it is resistant. The organism is usually resistant to commonly used antimicrobial agents, including most cephalosporins, aztreonam, antipseudomonal penicillins, imipenem, and the quinolones.
