Experiments were conducted to study the plasmids of Bordetella avium, B. avium-like, and B. bronchiseptica isolates from turkeys and the plasmids of the Art-Vax commercial vaccine strain. Plasmids were observed in 6 of 20 B. avium isolates, in 6 of 20 B. avium-like isolates, in all 5 B. bronchiseptica isolates, and in the Art-Vax strain. Plasmids of B. avium correlated with resistance to antibiotics but not with pathogenicity, hemagglutination of guinea pig erythrocytes, or expression of pili.
