A class of mutations that confer resistance to rifampin in Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli also suppresses the thermosensitivity of chromosome initiation in dnaA mutants. Ribonucleic acid polymerase is resistant to rifampin in vitro in these suppressive mutants, and the suppressors of dnaA cannot be separated from the rpoB mutations by transduction. It is concluded, therefore, that certain rpoB mutations may suppress the DnaA phenotype.
