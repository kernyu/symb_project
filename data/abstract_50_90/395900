The bacterial host range of coliphage P1 was extented by using the heat-inducible phage P1clr100KM. A gene for kanamycin resistance was transferred from Escherichia coli to members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and some other genera of gram-negative bacteria. P1 phage was produced by thermal induction from the lysogens of all these kanamycin-resistant bacteria except some strains.
