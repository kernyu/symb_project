EDTA and EGTA when used in conjunction with AgNO3 enhanced the antibacterial action of the latter significantly, so that strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus resistant to 70 micrograms/ml of AgNO3 were observed to became sensitive to 10 micrograms/ml of this compound. The synergistic effect of EDTA appears to be due to a mechanism other than the removal of lipopolysaccharide from outer membrane, as its effect could be observed in even non-LPS containing gram positive S. aureus cells. Penicillamine, another potent chelator had an opposite effect so that it decreased the toxicity of silver ions.
