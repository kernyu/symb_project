Three strains of mice (Swiss albinos, C57BL/6,C3H/OuJ) were injected intravenously with 3.7 x 10(6) colony forming units (CFU) of M. tuberculosis, H37RV, sensitive and resistant to antibiotics (90% of bacilli sensitive, 9% resistant to Streptomycin and 0.9% resistant to Kanamycin). Two weeks later, chemotherapy was started 6 days a week for a 6-month period with isoniazid (INH) and rifampicin (RMP). Twenty mice of each strain were killed at the end of the chemotherapy and the others were kept without antibiotics for a second 6-month follow-up period before being killed. The early multiplication of bacilli during the first 2 weeks following infection and before chemotherapy, was similar in the three strains of mice. Chemotherapy had the same apparent efficacy in the three strains of mice, nearly all the mice being cured as assessed by a negative spleen culture on Loewenstein-Jensen medium at the end of chemotherapy. But after the 6-month follow-up period, the C3H strain presented a statistically significantly higher level of positive spleen culture ('relapse') than seen in the C57BL/6 strain, and an increased number of mycobacteria per relapsing mouse spleen. It has been estimated with the help of resistant and sensitive bacilli that the relapses were due in most of the cases to the regrowth of one or very few bacilli, giving a clone. It seems that the C3H strain of mice, known to carry the Bcg-r allele of the Bcg gene, might be less able to develop a specific acquired resistance capable of stopping the delayed development of a highly virulent strain of mycobacteria.
