In an open study, 24 intensive care patients were treated with imipenem/cilastatin as monotherapy for serious bacterial infections. Twenty-one patients were treated for bronchopulmonary infection, two patients for septicaemia, and one patient for an empyema. Initially all strains were susceptible to imipenem. Gram-negative bacilli accounted for 80% of these isolates. The most frequently isolated species were Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. All 24 patients were considered clinically cured. Sixteen of these patients (67%) were both clinically and microbiologically cured. In eight of the 24 patients (33%), the strains isolated initially persisted. In eight of the 24 patients (33%), colonization of the respiratory tract developed. Two of the five Ps. aeruginosa isolates developed resistance during therapy but in none of these patients was therapy considered to have failed. In 12 patients (50%), transient elevations in hepatic function tests were observed and these were probably drug-related. The present study supports the view that imipenem/cilastatin may be useful as monotherapy in the treatment of severe infections in intensive care patients.
