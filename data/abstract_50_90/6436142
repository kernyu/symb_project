The study of 6-N-hydroxylaminopurine (HAP) and 2-amino-6-N-hydroxylaminopurine (AHAP) activity in bacteria and the yeast was undertaken. AHAP was found to be more effective as a mutagen in bacteria and HAP--in the yeast. Mutagenic and lethal effects or analogues were independent of excision and mutagenic repair both in bacteria and the yeast. Deletion in uvrB region of Salmonella genome leads to hypersensitivity to lethal and mutagenic action of analogues. Both of the latter only cause reversions of base-substitution but not frameshift mutations. Considering the data obtained and the information from published papers, we proposed that HAP and AHAP exert their mutagenic action, like classical analogues, by means of incorporation into DNA and disturbing the regular replication laws.
