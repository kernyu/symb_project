In a survey for the somatic and capsular serotypes of Pasteurella multocida present in domestic rabbits in Canada, but mainly in Ontario, samples were obtained from research facilities, commercial rabbitries and from abattoir and necropsy specimens. Sources of isolates were upper respiratory tract infections, localized bronchopneumonias , acute fibrinous pneumonias, abscesses and otitis media. Of 59 isolates obtained, 47.0% were type 12:A, 30.5% 3:D and 12.0% were 3:A. Less common types were 12(4):A, 12:D, 4(12):A and 3:untypable. Somatic group 3 was most commonly isolated from acute pneumonic disease, while serogroup 12:A was most commonly found in upper respiratory tract infections and in localized chronic bronchopneumonia. Two serotypes of P. multocida were isolated from four pneumonic lungs collected from abattoir specimens. Most isolates were susceptible to the commonly used antibiotics.
