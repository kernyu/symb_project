We have examined the susceptibility to acyclovir (ACV) of herpes simplex virus isolated from immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients. Susceptibility to ACV was determined in a dye-uptake assay with vero cells grown in 96-well microtitre plates. Resistant strains were found in two out of 35 (5.7%) patients and partially resistant strains in four out of 35 (11.4%) patients immunodeficient as a result of treatment for lymphoid or myeloid malignancy. Strains resistant to ACV were not found in organ transplant recipients or in immunocompetent patients.
