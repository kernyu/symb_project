Guinea pigs were infected cutaneously with HSV1 and treated topically with acyclovir or phosphonoformic acid (0.1% to 0.5% solution), or with a combination of both. The therapy was clinically effective and the virus content in the skin diminished. Virus harvests from skin areas in no case showed increased drug resistance, as tested by plaque reduction.
