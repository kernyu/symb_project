The comparative in vitro activity of erythromycin, roxithromycin and doxycycline against 20 isolates of M. avium and 20 M. xenopi was evaluated by two technics: a standard macrobroth dilution (7H9) and the 1% standard proportion method on lowenstein medium. M. avium was highly and uniformly resistant to doxycycline (MIC 50: 64 mg/l). For macrolides some strains were moderately susceptible to roxithromycin and at a lower level to erythromycin the MIC 50 and MIC 90 were respectively 8 and 16 mg/l for roxithromycin, 16 and 64 mg/l for erythromycin. Both macrolides were active against most of the strains of M. xenopi MIC 90 and MBC 90 were respectively 0.25 and 1 mg/l for roxithromycin, 0.5 and 2 mg/l for erythromycin. Doxycycline was less active inhibiting 90% of strains only at 16 mg/l.
