Laboratory and clinical studies were performed on cefmenoxime (CMX), a new cephalosporin antibiotic, and the following results were obtained. 1. Susceptibility of clinically isolated bacteria to CMX and cefotiam (CTM) or cefazolin (CEZ) Antimicrobial activity of CMX was compared with that of CTM and CEZ against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae and E. coli. CEZ and CTM were more active than CMX against S. aureus, S. epidermidis and S. pneumoniae. But CMX was found to be more active by 1-10 tubes than CEZ and CTM against H. influenzae and E. coli. 2. Clinical efficacy. CMX was intravenously administered to 19 patients; 3 with lacunar tonsillitis, 2 with acute bronchitis, 8 with bronchopneumonia, 3 with UTI, 1 with septicemia, 1 with acute panperitonitis, 1 with S.S.S.S. at daily doses of 30-115 mg/kg (64.6 mg/kg on an average) t.i.d. or q.i.d. for 3-17 days (6.1 days on an average). The overall efficacy rate was 94.7%, i.e., efficacy was excellent in 10 cases (52.6%), good in 8 cases (42.1%), and poor in 1 case (5.3%). Bacteriological efficacy was good, i.e. 16 of the 19 strains disappeared. Transient eosinophilia was observed in 1 patient, but no other laboratory abnormality was observed during treatment. The above results suggest that CMX is 1 of the useful antibiotics in treatment of pediatric infections, especially due to Gram negative bacteria.
