Waltho, Judith A. (University of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia), and B. W. Holloway. Suppression of fluorophenylalanine resistance by mutation to streptomycin resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. J. Bacteriol. 92:35-42. 1966.-Fluorophenylalanine-resistant mutants (fpa-r) of Pseudomonas aeruginosa have been isolated. By cotransduction analysis, the mutations were shown to have at least two chromosomal locations. One locus (fpaA) showed linkage to three other markers, str, try-3bi, and arg-3, and the order of these four linked markers was found to be try-3bi, arg-3, fpaA, str. The linkage relationships of the other fpa loci are not yet known. The phenotypic expression of resistance at the fpaA locus can be suppressed by mutation of the str locus from str-s to str-r, whereas that at an unlinked fpa locus cannot.
