The synergistic activity of cefotaxime and amikacin against 21 highly resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Serratia marcescens isolates was evaluated in-vitro by the checkerboard tube dilution method and in-vivo in five patients with serious infections caused by these organisms. All isolates were resistant to gentamicin, tobramycin, amikacin, and cefotaxime. Synergy was observed in 90% of isolates and occurred when the MIC of amikacin was less than 256 mg/l and of cefotaxime less than 1024 mg/l. A clinical response occurred in 100% and bacteriological cure in 80% of patients. Our results demonstrate a high degree of synergism between amikacin and cefotaxime in-vitro and clinical efficacy in the treatment of infections due to multiply-resistant Pseudomonas and Serratia species.
