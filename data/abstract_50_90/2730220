It was shown that under definite conditions there was competition between natural variants of sea bacteria belonging to V. fischeri. Natural variants of V. fischeri, strain 6 differed in their resistance to streptomycin and had different growth rates under conditions of limited aeration. Morphologically all the variants were identical. V. fischeri P-0, V. fischeri P-1 and V. fischeri P-2 were studied. The study revealed that V. fischeri P-0 produced a non-dialysing thermostable trypsin-sensitive substance inhibiting the growth of V. fischeri P-1 and V. fischeri P-2. The maximum activity of the antibacterial substance was observed when V. fischeri P-0 was grown in a liquid medium with peptone and yeast extract without agitation at 26 degrees C. The inhibiting substance was also active against V. fischeri BKM B995 and V. fischeri P-7 isolated as a result of V. fischeri P-0 exposure to ethidium bromide. The substance had no effect on the following bacterial species: Aeromonas liquefaciens 301, Achromobacter liquefaciens, Pseudomonas putida 15, Pseudomonas fluorescence 7, Escherichia coli AH-32 and Staphylococcus aureus.
