Campylobacter coli strain 981 of animal origin was resistant to erythromycin, tetracycline, streptomycin, kanamycin, ribostamycin, neomycin, paromomycin, lividomycin, and butirosin. Resistance to aminoglycosides of strain 981 was mediated by phosphotransferases APH (3') type-IV and APH (3"). C. coli 981 harboured three plasmids of 24, 34, and 40 Megadaltons respectively. None of these plasmids were transferable to Escherichia coli K-12 by conjugation.
