We employed latamoxef (LMOX) as antibiotic therapy subsequent to the performance of appendectomies in children. Fifteen patients, consisting of 8 cases of catarrhal appendicitis and 7 cases of gangrenous appendicitis, were administered LMOX at 50 mg/kg/day, while 13 patients with peritonitis due to a perforated appendix were treated with a dosage of 90 mg/kg/day. Both of these dosages were administered in 3 equally-divided doses, as one shot intravenous injections. All of the cases of catarrhal and gangrenous appendicitis showed good, steady recovery after the surgery, and there were no instances of complications. With regard to the 13 cases of perforating appendicitis, a clinical efficacy of at least "good" was obtained in 12 patients, for an efficacy rate of 92.3%. In addition, bacteriologically, 35 out of 36 strains that were isolated initially could no longer be detected after the LMOX therapy, indicating an eradication rate of 97.2%. Complications consisted of 1 case of dehiscence of the wound, and 1 case of adhesive ileus. Comparison of the values of the laboratory tests before and after the LMOX therapy revealed no development of abnormalities. Moreover, with regard to side effects, with the exception of 1 case of transient diarrhea, there were no side effects which presented clinical problems. It was found that the causative microbes involved in these cases of appendicitis--especially in the perforative appendicitis cases--were Gram-negative bacilli such as E. coli, and an anaerobic bacterium, B. fragilis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
