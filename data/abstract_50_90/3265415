The effects of antibiotics, antiseptics and disinfectants against some methicillin-resistant (MRSA) and methicillin-sensitive (MSSA) Staphylococcus aureus strains have been studied. The MRSA and MSSA strains were equally sensitive to phenols, esters of para(4)-hydroxybenzoic acid and chlorhexidine but MRSA strains were slightly more resistant to quaternary ammonium compounds and considerably more so to dibromopropamidine isothionate. Some MRSA strains were also resistant to phenylmercuric nitrate (but not another organomercurial, thiomersal), mercuric chloride and cadmium chloride. All MRSA strains produced beta-lactamase. Strains from the Royal Free Hospital, London were highly resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics, erythromycin, trimethoprim and tetracyclines but were sensitive to other antibiotics. One strain from the University Hospital of Wales, Cardiff was resistant to gentamicin but sensitive to tetracycline and trimethoprim.
