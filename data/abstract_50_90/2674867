To evaluate the resistant strains selection during treatment with cefmenoxime, a 3rd generation cephalosporin, 10 adult inpatients of an intensive-care unit had quantitative stool cultures, before the treatment, on the 7-10th day of therapy, and 7-10 days after the end of the antibiotic course. The results show that the selecting effect of cefmenoxime is not different from the effect previously observed for cefotaxime.
