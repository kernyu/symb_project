Acyl derivatives 5a approximately j and alkyl derivatives 7a approximately r of 4-dihydro-4-deoxy-4(R)-aminospectinomycin (1a) were prepared and tested for antibacterial activity. Only acyl compounds derived from long chain aliphatic acids showed activity in vitro, but were inactive when tested in vivo. All alkyl derivatives were active in vitro. In vivo however only the short chain derivatives 7a approximately c were active. Compound 7b showed higher activity than spectinomycin.
