The experiment, now in progress, consists in the gathering and processing of data obtained from the Antibiotic Sensitivity Test done in all the hospital laboratories in the aforesaid area and within which there may well be some interchange of patients. The Antibiotic Sensitivity Tests are arrived at from the identification of all the microorganisms found in the various biological specimens by rigorously standardized methodology. The data, reported on identical modules by all the laboratories and computerized by the CED of Treviso Hospital for half-yearly evaluation, will furnish information on the evolution of bacterial resistance and the related activity of the chemo-antibiotics for each individual hospital, for hospital groups, and for all the hospitals taken together. Details of the program of this operation, of the difficulties encountered, and of the current state of the survey are discussed.
