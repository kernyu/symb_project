Doxycycline was effective as a chemoprophylactic agent for experimental Leptospira infection in non-human primates and hamsters. Monkeys injected intraperitoneally with Leptospira bataviae, and receiving only diluent as treatment developed a leptospiremia during the first week and later leptospires were cultured from the cerebrospinal fluid and urine. Monkeys treated daily with oral doxycycline for 10 days beginning one day before infection had a shortened period of detectable leptospiremia, and organisms were never detected in the cerebrospinal fluid or urine. Even an oral dose of doxycycline 2 hours before infection and on day 7 prevented the later infection of the cerebrospinal fluid and urine. In hamsters, doxycycline treatment prevented deaths from acute Leptospira infection and when hamsters were treated daily for 4 or more days, renal infection was prevented. The results of animal studies, the susceptibility of LC0475 and the five other isolates to doxycycline in vitro, and lack of evidence for antibiotic resistance in culture suggests this antibiotic may be useful as a prophylactic drug for high risk groups and an effective treatment for leptospirosis in Thailand.
