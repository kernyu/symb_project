The structurally modified polyene antibiotic nystatin methyl ester (NME) has been utilized as a half-selection agent for isolating interspecific mouse--Syrian hamster hybrids. By using HAT media supplmented with NME we have isolated hybrid clones from polyethylene glycol-fused cultures of biochemically defective mouse (A9 or B82) and genetically normal Syrian hamster (KHK/C13) cells. Unfused parental cells were killed in HAT-NME media as a result of their genetic defect, absence of hypoxanthine guanine-phosphoribosyl transferase-HGPRT-(A9) or thymidine kinase--TK-(B82), or innate sensitivity to NME (BHK/C13). In contrast, hybrid cells proliferated and clones were isolated after 3 weeks growth in HAT-NME media, indicating the genetic complementation had occurred and polyene resistance was expressed as a dominant phenotypic property in the hybrids. The presently described technique is efficient in eliminating unfused parental cells and should prove useful in isolating other types of hybrids formed between genetically defective and normal parental cells.
