The world-wide increase of gonococcal infections and meningococcal infections should incite to face up all necessary means of checking which can be actually envisaged against these diseases. The major phenomenon regarding gonococcal infections is the appearance, since 1976, of plasmidic resistance by a beta-lactamase secretion. Two different types of strains have been described: one originating from West-Africa, the other one from South-East Asia (that latter presenting a conjugating plasmid to totalizing 24,5 M-daltons involving coding plasmid for beta-lactamase). Among approximately thirty strains isolated in France, these ones appear to be equally shared out between these two types, following the results of our actual studies. Catlin's auxotype, which has been used in France and in some African countries (study in progress) tends to confirm the previous studies: auxotypes variations according to clinical forms an geographical distribution of strains. The other markers described in the literature are debated. As to meningococcus serogoups that we have carried out, they show a distribution well known in France, i.e. group B is largely predominating, groups A and C coming afterwards. It should be noted the appearance of some cases caused by groups Y and W135. The first results obtained thanks to serotyping, according to Frasch's technique appear to show a majority of type 2 or 2-associated in cases of diseases as other authors have proved.
