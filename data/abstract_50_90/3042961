The strength characteristics of the cement-implant interface were evaluated for smooth-tapered, threaded, and porous-surfaced endodontic implants with the use of different cements. Specifically, tensile and torsional shear strengths were measured for zinc phosphate, polycarboxylate, glass-ionomer, silicophosphate, and AH-26 cements. The results indicated superior shear strength characteristics for threaded endodontic implants on axial loading. However, this strength was diminished when torsional forces were applied. Porous-surfaced endodontic implants showed strong resistance to both axial and torsional loading.
