A 50 mul sample of blood is placed successively in the presence of staphylococci, then of tritiated thymidine. Stripping film autoradiography permits identification of living intracellular bacteria which metabolize the marked precursor. In our experimental conditions, the percentage of marked intracellular bacteria is: -- 15,4 +/- 3,7% (x +/- 1s) among adults -- 14,6 +/- 3,2% among children.
