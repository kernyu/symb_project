Broad host-range plasmid RK2 is able to replicate in a controlled manner in most Gram negative bacterial species. To analyze the elements of its control mechanism, we have measured the copy number in Escherichia coli of mini-RK2 replicons isogenic except for defined deletions in regions adjacent to the vegetative replication origin, oriVRK2, which have previously been implicated in copy number control because of their expression of plasmid incompatibility. The results indicate that while the previously defined 700-bp HaeII oriVRK2 fragment carries one copy control element (copA), a second (copB) lies at least partly outside this fragment towards the tetracycline resistance genes of RK2. Deletions affecting both these regions give a mini replicon with a copy number of 35-40 compared with 4-7 for parental RK2. Further incompatibility experiments indicate that targets for both incA (copA) and incB (copB) lie within the 700-bp HaeII oriVRK2 fragment.
