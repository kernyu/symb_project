The name Koserella trabulsii is proposed for a group of Enterobacteriaceae formerly called Enteric Group 45. This group consists of 12 strains that were originally identified as atypical Hafnia alvei. K. trabulsii strains were negative for indole production, Voges-Proskauer, H2S production, urea hydrolysis, phenylalanine deaminase, and acid production from glycerol, lactose, sucrose, and D-sorbitol; they were positive for methyl red, citrate (Simmons), lysine and ornithine decarboxylases, arginine dihydrolase (negative in 1 to 2 days and positive in 3 to 7 days), and acid production from cellobiose and melibiose; and they were resistant to the Hafnia-specific bacteriophage of Guinee and Valkenburg. They were tested for DNA relatedness by the hydroxyapatite method with 32PO4-labeled DNA from the designated type strain (CDC 3349-72, ATCC 35313). The 12 strains were 87 to 99% related in 60 degrees C reactions. Relatedness of K. trabulsii to 71 DNA hybridization reference strains of representative species of Enterobacteriaceae was 4 to 37%. It was 15 to 16% related to H. alvei. All strains were susceptible to nalidixic acid, sulfadiazine, gentamicin, kanamycin, and chloramphenicol, and 83% were susceptible to nalidixic acid, sulfadiazine, gentamicin, kanamycin, and chloramphenicol, and 83% were susceptible to tetracycline. Most of the strains were resistant or intermediate to penicillin, ampicillin, carbenicillin, colistin, and cephalothin. Five of the strains were isolated from wounds, three were from the respiratory tract, and one each was from a stool, knee fluid, water, and an unknown source. The clinical significance of this organism is not known; therefore, future studies should focus on its isolation and its relationship to human disease.
