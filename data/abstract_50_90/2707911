Although in vitro studies have demonstrated ethanol-induced coronary artery constriction, in vivo reports suggest an ethanol-related coronary dilator effect with increases in coronary blood flow. The principal difference in these studies is the demonstration of epicardial coronary constriction with ethanol, while dilation is described only in resistance vessels. Clinical studies have noted evidence of myocardial ischemia following ethanol ingestion in patients with coronary artery disease, suggesting ethanol-related constriction of diseased epicardial coronary arteries. This study hypothesized that intravenous ethanol would constrict canine epicardial coronary arteries while producing arteriolar resistance vessel dilatation. Ten closed-chest mongrel dogs weighing 24 +/- 1 kg (mean +/- SEM) were given 8 g of ethanol intravenously over 30 min. Left anterior descending and circumflex proximal artery diameters were measured by quantitative coronary angiography; myocardial flow was measured by Xenon washout, and myocardial flow distribution was measured with radioactive microspheres. Baseline proximal left anterior descending and circumflex artery areas were 6.3 +/- 0.5 and 5.8 +/- 0.4 mm2, respectively. Up to 30% left anterior descending and circumflex proximal artery narrowing was noted at 60 and 90 min following ethanol infusion. The constriction was reversed with nitroglycerin. There was a decrease in left anterior descending artery flow but no change in circumflex artery flow at 60 min. Blood ethanol level varied from 520 micrograms/ml initially to 205 micrograms/ml 90 min after the infusion terminated (intoxication = 1500 micrograms/ml). These data suggest that ethanol has significant vasoconstrictor action in vivo on epicardial coronary arteries.
