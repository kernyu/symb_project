The potential value of a blood agar medium containing a final concentration of 5.5 mug of gentamicin per ml was assessed in a diagnostic laboratory over an 8-week period. The medium gave increased isolation rates of beta-hemolytic streptococci, other streptococci, Bacteroides, clostridia, and yeasts. It also proved valuable in detecting gentamicin-resistant gram-negative bacilli when these were present in heavy mixed culture.
