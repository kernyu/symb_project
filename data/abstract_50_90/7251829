Pseudomonas paucimobilis was isolated from blood of a man after surgery for occlusive vascular disease of his lower extremities. Circumstances suggest that the infection was hospital associated and was possibly caused by an organism present in the surroundings of this particularly susceptible host. An environmental source was found. The isolate was susceptible in vitro to carbenicillin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and was moderately susceptible to amikacin and ampicillin. This case represents the fourth report incidence of infection due to P. paucimobilis.
