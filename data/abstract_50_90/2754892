Susceptibility of various antimicrobial agents against clinically isolated Staphylococcus aureus was evaluated by Kirby Bauer methods. The incidence of MRSA (Methicillin cephem resistant Staphylococcus aureus) was also investigated. When S. aureus was isolated from urine, the clinical background of the case was further studied. The results are listed below; 1) M1N0 showed the highest susceptibility rate (83.1%) against 537 strains of S. aureus tested, followed by CMZ (63.7%) and CET (63.5%). The susceptibility rate of DMPPC was 41.9%. The incidence of MRSA was 31.3%. 2) In effusion, MRSA was most highly isolated (72.2%). 3) S. aureus isolated from blood and sputa was relatively more resistant to beta-lactams. 4) Strains from urine showed relatively high susceptibility rates. No MRSA was isolated from urine. 5) Thirteen out of twenty-four cases, whose urines were proven to be S. aureus positive, were polymicrobial infection patients.
