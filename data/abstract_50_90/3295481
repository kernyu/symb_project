N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) pretreatments increase the resistance of Escherichia coli to gamma-radiation. The increased resistance is dependent on functional polA, recA, recB, recC, and lexA genes and is partly dependent on recN. The MNNG-induced resistance is additive to resistance induced by pretreatment with gamma-radiation but not by increases induced by hydrogen peroxide. The MNNG-induced resistance occurs in adaptive response mutants and at pretreatment levels of MNNG that do not activate cells to reactivate UV-inactivated lambda phage. The MNNG-induced resistance appears to be distinct from other inductions to gamma-radiation resistance.
