In vitro and in vivo transfers of antibiotic drug resistance were observed when isolates of multi-resistant Salmonella saint-paul and Escherichia coli donors were mated with multi-sensitive E coli and Salmonella typhimurium recipients, respectively. For in vivo studies, day-old turkey poults were used. Drug resistances were transferred either alone or in various combinations. In vitro, transfer was more frequent from E coli to S typhimurium; in vivo, transfer was more often observed from S saint-paul to E coli. Transfer occurred in vivo within 3 or 6 days after the recipient strain was given to poults previously infected with donor bacteria. In some instances, phage typing of S typhimurium indicated a change after transfer of drug resistance from E coli to S typhimurium. The criteria for in vivo transfer of drug resistance were discussed, and the implications of a change in phage type were noted.
