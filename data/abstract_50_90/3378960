Eighty-seven episodes of infection occurring in 83 patients were treated with imipenem as the sole antibiotic (1.5-4 g daily). All patients were aged 65 years or over, many with other non-infective diseases. A favourable clinical outcome (infection cured or improved) was obtained in 88% of cases. Of the 37 patients who were microbiologically evaluable, a favourable clinical outcome occurred in 92% and a favourable bacteriological outcome (pathogen eradicated or suppressed) occurred in 86% of cases. There were 13 deaths amongst the study group, which might be expected in an ill elderly population. None of the deaths was thought attributable to imipenem. Minor clinical side effects occurred in 10.6%, and one patient sustained a cerebral ischaemic episode and fits, possibly related to imipenem. No serious changes were detected in laboratory parameters.
