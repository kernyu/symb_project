The clinical material for our studies of serum total LDH activity and LDH isoenzymes in leprosy included 255 patients consisting of Tuberculoid (74), Lepromatous leprosy (116), and Lepromatous leprosy with lepra reaction (65). 20 patients with suspected DDS resistance and repeated attacks of lepra reactions were selected for Clofazimine studies. All leprosy patients exhibited higher total LDH activity as compared to normals. M/H ratio was significantly increased in patients of Lepromatous leprosy and correlated closely with the clinical severity and advancement of disease. Tuberculoid leprosy patients showed values close to normals. Hence M/H ratio could demarcate two polar types of leprosy i.e. Tuberculoid and Lepromatous leprosy. Clofazimine treatment over a period of one year in patients with suspected DDS resistance and repeated attacks of lepra reaction decreased total LDH activity and M/H ratio considerably. Fall in M/H ratio during Clofazimine treatment could be attributed to the clearance of 'M' subunits by the drug due to removal of blockade of R.E.S. system produced by lepra bacilli.
