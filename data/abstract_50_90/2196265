Twenty-one patients with disseminated malignant melanoma were treated with a combination of carboplatin and cytosine arabinoside. Two complete and three partial remissions occurred. No complete cross-resistance was found with a regimen containing 5-(dimethyltriazeno)imidazole-4-carboxamide (DTIC) in two patients. It is suggested that this regimen might be studied further as a second-line treatment for patients who fail on DTIC-containing treatment.
