Sensitivity of 130 clinical strains of gram-negative bacteria isolated from cardiosurgical patients was studied comparatively with respect to 5 aminoglycosides: monomycin, kanamycin, neomycin, gentamicin and sisomicin. The strains were mainly isolated from purulent wounds and the respiratory tract of patients in the postoperative period. All the patients were operated on with the use of artificial circulation. Analysis of the antibioticograms revealed that 30 per cent of the strains were resistant to all the aminoglycosides and 58 per cent showed selective sensitivity. Sisomicin was the most active antibiotic with respect to the clinical strains of gram-negative bacteria.
