The spread of coagulase-positive staphylococci has been studied in a modern hospital in which most of the patients were nursed in 4-bed rooms separated from a common corridor only by low dividing walls. Acquisition of new nasal strains from patients in other bedrooms was nearly as easy as from patients in the neighbouring beds. There was no indication that subdivision of this type hindered the spread of nasal strains as compared with open wards of the ;Nightingale' pattern.
