Sensitivity of 4 clinical strains of Staph. aureus and E. coli to 13 hydroacridine derivatives and their combinations with antibiotics, such as benzylpenicillin, ampicillin, semi-synthetic penicillins, streptomycin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, chlortetracycline, monomycin, oleandomycin and erythromycin was studied. The highest bacteriostatic effect was observed on the use of perhydroactidine derivatives with benzylpenicillin or ampicillin with respect to polyresistant penicillinase-producing strains of Staph. aureus, resistance of which to these antibiotics was decreased 250--1000 times. Under the effect of the above compounds the staphylococcal resistance to chloramphenicol, tetracycline, chlortetracycline, oleandomycine and erythromycin decreased 2--66 times. The combinations of hydroacridine with the antibiotics, except 10-amino-trans-syn-trans-perhydroacridine had no effect on the resistance of the E. coli strains. The results of the combined effect of the above substances were associated with their chemical nature, the bacterial type and possibly the character of the strain resistance.
