Differences in the susceptibility to paralytogenic infection with Coxsackie A10 virus were found in neonate and suckling mice belonging to A2G, ICR-K and CBA strains and ICR-K/CBA and CBA/ICR-K hybrids in the F1 generation. At the first passage in vivo the more susceptible strains selected paralytogenic viral particles from among the cytopathogenic and non-pathogenic Coxsackie A10 virus populations. The differences in susceptibility could not be related either with the humoral immune response to virus or to the rate of fixation of virus on the neonate mouse muscle cell receptors. These differences are, however, in agreement with the data concerning the synthesis of interferon in the striated muscle, the lots with greater resistance to viral infection being also those which synthesize interferon in higher concentrations. The hybrids resulting from the parental strains more susceptible to virus, presented a resistance superior to that of the parents.
