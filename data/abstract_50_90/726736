One hundred strains of Propionibacterium acnes, granulosum and avidum were tested for susceptibility toward bacteriocins produced extracellularly by eight strains of Propionibacterium avidum. Some bacteriocin-producing strains were inhibitory for all strains tested. A name propionicins, is proposed for bacteriocins produced by P. avidum.
