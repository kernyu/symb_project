The in-vitro activity of ticarcillin was found to be greater than that of carbenicillin against 97 out of 100 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa which were recently isolated from clinical specimens at the Royal Perth Hospital complex. These results indicate that ticarcillin should be considered for use in place of carbenicillin for treating infections caused by P. aeruginosa.
