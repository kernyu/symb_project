The role of systems for glucose transport in the manifestation of carbon catabolite repression of glucoamylase synthesis was studied in the yeast Endomycopsis fibuligera. Experimentas were conducted with its mutant AB-192 defective in the system of transport universal for glucose and 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG). The nature of the mutation was established from the following data: (1) transport of labeled glucose into the mutant cells was twice as low in comparison with the parent culture 20-9; (2) transport of labeled 2-DG was suppressed almost entirely; (3) no competition was found between glucose and 2-DG for penetration into the mutant cells. Glucoamylase synthesis in the mutant AB-192 was not sensitive to catabolite repression by glucose. This was confirmed by the resistance of the AB-192 cells to the inhibition by glucose and their complete resistance to the repression by 2-DG. Moreover, an addition of cAMP did not stimulate glucoamylase synthesis by the mutant culture in the presence of glucose and 2-DG. It can be concluded therefore that the resistance of the yeast to catabolite repression by the glucose is caused by the mutation in the system for carbohydrate transport. The results suggest that the system of glucose transport plays an important role in the manifestation of carbon catabolite repression in the yeast Endomycopsis fibuligera.
