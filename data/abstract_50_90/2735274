A newly developed quinolone compound, T-3262, was administered in the treatment of 36 cases of urinary tract infection (UTI) between June and August in 1988. Thirteen cases of acute uncomplicated cystitis (AUC) were evaluated with the Japanese UTI criteria at a dose of 300 mg a day for 3 days after the administration of the drug. The clinical efficacy was obtained as 92.3%. Twenty two cases of chronic complicated UTI (CC-UTI) were evaluated with the criteria, the clinical efficacy rate was 86.4% at a dose of 300-450 mg a day for 5 days administration. The clinical efficacy judged by doctor in charge was evaluated as effective for 100% on AUC and for 90.9% on CC-UTI. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of new quinolones for clinical strains isolated in the clinical study was compared with that of the strains isolated from CC-UTI at our and other institutes in the last two years. There were no significant differences in in vitro activity found among the three groups. Comparing the efficacy rate on CC-UTI with that of the open trial in Japan in 1987, despite a general tendency for increase of resistant strains to new quinolones, a high effectiveness such as 82.3% in CC-UTI that was almost similar to the open trial was achieved. Neither side reactions except for mild and transient gastric discomfort in 2 patients nor significant clinical abnormal values were encountered. In conclusion, T-3262 is an effective and useful antimicrobial drug in the treatment of UTI, and its effectiveness is still almost comparable to the result of clinical studies that have been carried out in the last two years.
