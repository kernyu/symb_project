An agar dilution method was used to measure the MICs of 29 antimicrobial agents against Enterobacter sakazakii, E. cloacae, E. aerogenes, E. agglomerans, E. amnigenus, E. gergoviae, E. intermedium, and E. taylorae (formerly Enteric Group 19). E. sakazakii was the most susceptible species. Results showing resistance to ampicillin are likely to exclude E. sakazakii.
