Fourteen conjugative naphthalene degradative plasmids have been classified by incompatibility. It is shown that the plasmids of IncP-9 group are characterized by the minor entry exclusion, with respect to the R plasmids belonging to IncP-2 or IncP-7 groups. On the other hand, the naphthalene degradative plasmids of incompatibility group P-7 exhibit a markedly pronounced entry exclusion, with respect to the R plasmids of the same incompatibility groups. Two naphthalene degradative plasmids reveal incompatibility with the reference plasmids of two Inc groups (P-2 and P-7). These plasmids control also resistance of bacterial cells to potassium tellurite, which is characteristic of the IncP-2 plasmids. Two other naphthalene degradative plasmids are capable of stable coexistence with the IncP-2, P-7 or P-9 reference plasmids.
