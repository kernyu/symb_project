In a period of 15 months 601 patients (440 males, 161 females) with uncomplicated genital gonorrhea were examined bacteriologically and clinically. Diagnosis was by microscopy and culture. The sensitivity of the gonococci strains to antibiotics was tested by agar disc and the agar plate dilution culture media. 10 cases of penicillinase producing gonococci strains were found among the 601 isolates. The presence of beta-lactamase activity in all strains was confirmed by the chromogenic cephalosporin test. PPNG strains proved to be highly resistant to penicillin. These strains (PPNG) have been imported from South East Asia and West Africa. Among the isolates, only 2 cases of the South East Asian strains displayed the common tetracycline resistance. All PPNG strains were sensitive to spectinomycin and cefuroxine.
