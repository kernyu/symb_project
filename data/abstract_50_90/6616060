The insoluble complexes of poly (I) . poly (C) with histones and poly-L-lysin have been obtained. These complexes are insoluble in isotonic solutions and have no admixtures of polycations. Resistance to enzymatic degradation, the melting point and sorption on the cells of the complexes obtained increase with the growth of the polycation amount in the complexes, while the interferon-inducing capacity reduces. Based on the obtained and reported data the conclusion is made that resistance to enzymatic degradation, the high melting point and the high sorption of the inductor on the cells are necessary but insufficient conditions for the induction of interferon synthesis. It is assumed that the inductor ability to make complexes with cellular proteins is the characteristics responsible for the interferon-inducing capacity of the inductor.
