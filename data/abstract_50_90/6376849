We have studied ceftazidime (CAZ), a cephem antibiotic of the new generation, for its antibacterial activity against H. influenzae and clinical effects. Antibacterial activity: MICs of CAZ for 142 strains of H. influenzae including 11 ABPC-resistant strains which were clinically isolated, were determined, and the results were good for all the strains. Clinical effects: CAZ was administered to 9 children with infections. Suspected causative organisms were H. influenzae, E. coli, P. aeruginosa, group B Streptococcus and S. pneumoniae. Eradication of these organisms was confirmed in all the strains except for one in which the antibacterial effect of CAZ was unknown. Clinical efficacy was excellent or good in all the cases. No side effect was observed except for eosinophilia noted in 1 case.
