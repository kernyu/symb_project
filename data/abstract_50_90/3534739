The comparative susceptibility of 1 850 yeast strains belonging to 8 species was determined. The standardized micromethods used allows determinations of minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) or categorized sensitivities for two different concentrations (AB). Overall results showed that amphotericin B (AMB) is the most active agent, followed by the various imidazoles. 5-fluorocytosine (5FC) was the least effective drug, with 68% susceptible strains. However, results varied widely across species and drugs. For instance, among Candida albicans and Torulopsis glabrata strains, none were resistant to AMB and only 6% were resistant to 5-FC; in contrast, Candida albicans was highly susceptible to imidazoles (0.8 to 2.5% resistant strains) whereas Torulopsis glabrata showed much higher resistance rates (18% of strains for tioconazole and 70% for ketoconazole). Variations in susceptibility were also recorded across imidazoles: clotrimazole, tioconazole and ketoconazole were much more effective against Candida tropicalis and Candida parapsilosis than miconazole and econazole, whereas almost no strains were resistant to AMB and more than 50% of strains were resistant to 5-FC. Results obtained by AB (967 strains) and MIC (455 strains) were consistent for the 1 422 Candida albicans strains. Our results show that standardized micromethods should be used to determine the susceptibility of yeasts to antifungal agents.
