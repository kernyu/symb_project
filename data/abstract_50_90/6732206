The antibiotic AL-87 resistant variant of S. aureus 209P was grown on the antibiotic-free medium. The study on its fatty acid composition showed that it was analogous to the fatty acid composition of the initial sensitive strain with the predominance of branched fatty acids. However, when the resistant variant was grown on the antibiotic-containing medium, it was characterized by a markedly changed fatty acid composition with the predominance of the straight chain saturated and unsaturated fatty acids, mainly hexadecanoic and octadecenic acids. The fatty acid composition of the resistant variant grown in the presence of the antibiotic was close to that of a wide range of gram-positive and gram-negative microogranisms.
