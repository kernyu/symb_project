Two mutations (lysS1 and lysS2), each independently resulting in a thermosensitive, lysyl-transfer RNA synthetase (l-lysine: tRNA ligase [adenosine 5'-monophosphate] EC 6.1.1.6), have been mapped on the Bacillus subtilis chromosome between purA16 (adenine requirement) and sul (sulfanilamide resistance). They are linked by transformation with sul (70 to 74% cotransfer) in the order purA16-lysS1-lysS2-sul. The mutant loci are either in the same gene or in two closely linked genes. They are not linked to the tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase structural gene or to the lys-1 locus.
