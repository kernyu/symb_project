Persistent infections with Sendai and SSPE virus were established in Vero cells. Sequential passages of these cells were monitored by immunofluorescence and for their sensitivity to the antiviral and antiproliferative effects of interferon (IFN). The cells rapidly developed resistance to the antiviral effect of IFN as judged by the inability of IFN to inhibit the replication of exogenous Sindbis virus. This decrease was accompanied by a reduction in the induction of the 2'-5' oligo A synthetase. Both cell lines were resistant to the antiproliferative effect of IFN. A decrease or absence of IFN receptors on the surface of the cells was not found to be the cause of their resistance to IFN.
