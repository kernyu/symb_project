Experimental studies have suggested that antigen-specific T lymphocytes are important mediators of resistance to infection with the pathogenic fungus Histoplasma capsulation. To gain a better understanding of the role of T lymphocytes, we developed murine T-cell lines and clones that recognized Histoplasma antigens. These T cells were of the helper/inducer phenotype (Thy-1.2+ Lyt-1+ L3T4+ Lyt-2-) and exerted multiple immunological functions. T-cell lines and 12 clones proliferated vigorously in response to histoplasmin; the T-cell lines and 6 clones also were reactive with heterologous fungal antigens prepared from either Blastomyces dermatitidis or Coccidioides immitis. Recognition of antigen by T cells was H-2 restricted; in the absence of antigen, four clones demonstrated alloreactivity. All T-cell clones conferred local delayed-type hypersensitivity responses when injected with antigen into footpads of mice. Ten of 12 T-cell clones released interleukin-2 after stimulation with antigen, and all clones tested secreted interferon. Moreover, culture supernatants from antigen-stimulated clones armed peritoneal macrophages to inhibit intracellular growth of H. capsulatum yeast cells. All clones assayed exerted nonspecific help. Thus, development of T-cell clones should facilitate analysis of the regulatory properties of Histoplasma-specific T cells.
