Variation of different features of populations of streptomycin-sensitive and streptomycin-resistant forms of M. purpurea var. violacea, an organism producing gentamicin was studied. The population of the initial streptomycin-sensitive culture was characterized by high homogeneity with respect to the cultural, morphological and some physiological properties. The variation of the features, such as the colony size, pigment formation, auxotrophic mutations, antibiotic production significantly increased in populations grown on media with streptomycin. Mutants differing from the initial strain by a complex of cultural, morphological and physiological features and in particular the antibiotic production were isolated from populations of the streptomycin-resistant variants.
