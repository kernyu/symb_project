Three strains of S. aureus isolated from patients were studied and it was shown that their population was heterogenous with respect to antibiotic AL-87: it contained both the antibiotic sensitive and the antibiotic resistant species in different ratios. The fatty acid composition induced by low concentrations of the antibiotic (subbacteriostatic for the sensitive microorganism) characterized by predominance of branched chain fatty acids in the antibiotic sensitive microorganisms and straight chain fatty acids in the antibiotic resistant microorganisms may serve a marker of sensitivity or resistance. Therefore, the data are indicative of the presence of genetic information in staphylococci determining their resistance to antibiotic AL-87 not yet used in medical practice.
