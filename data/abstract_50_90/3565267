Humans have been exposed to azodicarbonamide (ADA) by inhalation where bulk quantities of ADA are handled in the workplace. Responses of some workers have led to concern for the potential irritant and sensitizing properties of inhaled ADA. This study examined the effects of inhaling ADA on lung structure and function of guinea pigs during and after an acute exposure. Groups of 20 guinea pigs were exposed to each of 3 concentrations of ADA (19, 58, and 97 mg/m3), plus air as a control, for 1 hr. Pulmonary function was measured before exposure (baseline), during exposure, immediately after exposure and 24 hr after exposure. Dynamic compliance (Cdyn), total pulmonary resistance (RL), tidal volume (VT), respiratory frequency and minute volume were measured. In addition, gross necropsies and histological examinations of respiratory tract tissues were done either immediately following the exposure or 24 hr after exposure. There were no effects of ADA exposure on gross necropsy, histology, Cdyn, or RL. Some significant, concentration-related decreases in VT, respiratory frequency and minute volume were seen. The magnitudes of these changes were small: the largest change was seen in minute volume, amounting to a 24% decrease in the high concentration group. Inhalation exposure of guinea pigs to ADA at concentrations of up to 97 mg/m3 resulted in minor changes in pulmonary function without any changes in lung histology.
