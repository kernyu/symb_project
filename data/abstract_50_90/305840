Ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae does occur now in the FRG. In one isolate a plasmid with resistance genes (R-factor) could be demonstrated as cause of the ampicillin resistance. This R-factor influences production of a beta-lactamase of the TEM type which destroys ampicillin. The infectious nature of the ampicillin resistance was proven by the fact that it was transferable to other bacterial species through cocultivation. Parallel to ampicillin resistance tetracycline resistant Haemophilus influenzae has occurred in the FRG. Here the resistance was equally bound to plasmids. These R-factors are infectious as well. Molecular analysis of the 3 isolated resistance factors in Haemophilus influenzae showed that they carry the same resistance genes which are known from R-factors of Enterobacteriaceae. In the therapy of purulent infections due to Haemophilus influenzae such as childhood meningitis one can no longer rely on general ampicillin sensitivity of the offender. Apart from ampicillin and tetracycline resistant Haemophilus influenzae chloramphenicol resistance has been observed in a few cases.
