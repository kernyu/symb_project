Escherichia coli grown in limited methionine and excess norleucine media accumulate cyanogen bromide-resistant species of proteins after the methionine supply is exhausted. Bacteria, transformed by recombinant plasmid pIPD37 carrying the adk gene and grown under limiting methionine and excess norleucine, synthesize 16-20% of adenylate kinase molecules having all 6 methionine residues replaced by norleucine. Species showing only partial replacement of methionine residues by norleucine are identified by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis after cyanogen bromide treatment of pure enzyme. Norleucine-substituted adenylate kinase shows structural and catalytic properties similar to the wild-type protein as indicated by circular dichroism spectroscopy and kinetic experiments but exhibits a much higher resistance to hydrogen peroxide inactivation under denaturing conditions.
