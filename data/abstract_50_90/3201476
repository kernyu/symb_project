Flow cytometric analysis of the cell cycle is most effectively accomplished with membrane-/cytoplasm-free ("clean") nuclei. Non-ionic detergents (e.g. NP40 or Triton X-100) commonly are employed to solubilize cell membranes/cytoplasm to produce "clean" nuclei. Treatment of murine erythroleukemic cells (MELC) with tri-n-butyltin methoxide, cadmium acetate, zinc sulfate, or lead acetate alters the properties of the cell membrane/cytoplasm complex making it resistant to NP40 dissolution. On a molar basis, the organotin compound was more effective in inducing resistance to detergent-mediated dissolution than the inorganic metal compounds. Resistance to NP40-mediated dissolution was manifested as an increase in the flow cytometric parameters 90 degrees scatter and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) fluorescence and was confirmed by light microscopy.
