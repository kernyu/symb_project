Listeria monocytogenes was used to study the rate of development, magnitude, and persistence of the antimicrobial resistance engendered by Nocardia brasiliensis infection in mice. The growth of Listeria in the liver and spleen was more effectively restricted in Nocardia-infected mice than in noninfected animals. The development of delayed-type hypersensitivity to the Nocardia antigen was closely correlated to the increased resistance to Listeria, suggesting that both properties are the consequence of a single immunological event. The antibacterial resistance was also demonstrated in vitro. The results of the foregoing studies indicate that the microbicidal ability of macrophages, very likely activated by cell-mediated immunity, in enhanced in mice infected with Nocardia.
