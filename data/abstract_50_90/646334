The culture of Staphylococcus aureus was administered intraperitoneally in a dose of LD30 to albino mice. The animals of the 1st, 2nd and 3rd groups were treated with lincomycin, chymotripsin and combination of lincomycin with chymotripsin respectively. The animals of the 4th group were used as control and were not subjected to the treatment with the drugs. A part of the animals from every group was killed on the 3rd, 7th, 14th, 21st and subsequent days and their organs were investigated microscopically and bacteriologically. It was found that staphylococci was isolated from the control mice during a 50-day period after inoculation. Complete liberation of the organs from the causative agent within 25 days from the beginning of the experiment was registered in the animals treated with lincomycin. Isolation of the staphylococci was over by the 27th day in the animals treated with chymotrypsin. Liberation of the organs from the causative agent by the 17th day was observed in the albino mice treated with the combination of lincomycin with chymotrypsin. The combined use of lincomycin with chymotrypsin proved to be most effective: no death was registered among the albino mice, the levels of the pathogenicity and antibiotic resistance in the pathogenic staphylococci decreased.
