Independent plasmids mediating resistance either to tetracycline (Tc) or chloramphenicol (Cm) were transduced successively into Staphylococcus aureus strain 8325. From this doubly resistant donor strain, Tc was co-transduced with a frequency of 40 to 50% when Cm was selected. Co-transduction of Cm was 5 to 10% with Tc selection. Plasmid elimination was infrequent and restricted to the Cm plasmid. A variant, doubly resistant strain gave 100% co-transduction of Tc and Cm and a high rate of joint elimination of both plasmid markers. Co-transduction of the plasmids from recombination-deficient donor strains was much reduced if the plasmids had been introduced separately into the donor strain, but occurred at the normal high rate if they had been introduced jointly. The plasmids were co-transformed at relatively low rates with closed circular deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) from doubly resistant donors, but not with DNA from a mixed lysate of singly resistant strains. Our evidence favored a hypothesis of recombination-dependent, reversible linkage between the two plasmids as the basis for their co-transduction. Examination of plasmid DNA from the doubly resistant strains by ultracentrifugal and electron microscopic methods did not disclose any physical differences between singly and doubly resistant strains that might account for the observed co-transduction.
