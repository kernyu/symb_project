The growth and pathogenicity of Mycoplasma gallisepticum 1RF were studied in chicken tracheal organ cultures. The organism propagated only in the presence of tracheal rings in culture fluids. Presence of metabolic products from rings seems to be an important factor for the growth of organism. Production of hydrogen peroxide was not detected. There were no differences in the growth and cilia-stopping effects among organisms maintained in vitro, stored at -18 degrees C, and recovered from air sac, trachea and joints of infected chickens. No local resistance in tracheal organs from immunised chickens was found. The tracheal organ culture system can readily be used for drug evaluation.
