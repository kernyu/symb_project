Allelic assortment of Tetrahymena pyriformis makes possible the isolation of cells which contain both a heterozygous germ line nucleus and a somatic nucleus which expresses phenotypes of only one member of allelic pairs. Cycloheximide-sensitive segregants have been isolated from the vegetative progeny of cells heterozygous for a dominant mutation conferring resistance to cycloheximide; such segregants are called functional heterokaryons. Since progeny from crosses of these cells are cycloheximide-resistant, addition of the drug provides positive selection for successful exconjugants. The timing for expression of the new phenotype during conjugation is presented and used to identify what appear to be immature progeny of round one mating in genomic exclusion. Usefulness of functional heterokaryons in a number of genetic and developmental studies is discussed.
