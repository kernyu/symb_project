The in vitro activity of the synthetic fluoroquinolone amifloxacin was compared with those of six other antibiotics: ampicillin, aztreonam, cefotaxime, cephalexin, cinoxacin, and gentamicin. Amifloxacin had the lowest 50% MIC of any of the antibiotics tested against aminoglycoside-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4 micrograms/ml.
