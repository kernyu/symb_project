We compared the antimicrobial susceptibility results obtained with the Cathra replicator and reference methods when Staphylococcus aureus strains were tested by using agar dilution techniques. The Cathra replicator and the 0.001-ml calibrated loop gave results that fell within +/- 1 log2 dilution for greater than or equal to 95% of isolates when methicillin and cefamandole were tested.
