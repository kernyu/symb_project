Treatment of permeable human fibroblasts with bleomycin elicits DNA repair synthesis that is only partially sensitive to aphidicolin, an inhibitor of mammalian DNA polymerases alpha and delta. Inhibition of long-patch repair synthesis by omission of the three unlabeled deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs) selectively eliminates the aphidicolin-sensitive component. The majority of this residual aphidicolin-resistant repair synthesis is contained in ligated patches as revealed by resistance to exonuclease III. Determination of repair patch length by bromodeoxyuridine-induced density shift under conditions where essentially all of the repair synthesis is sensitive or resistant to aphidicolin yielded values of approximately 20 and 4 nucleotides per patch, respectively. On the basis of these data and the relative sensitivity of bleomycin-induced repair synthesis to N2-(p-n-butylphenyl)-2'-deoxyguanosine 5'-triphosphate (BuPdGTP), 2',3'-dideoxythymidine 5'-triphosphate (ddTTP), and N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), long-patch repair is attributed to DNA polymerase delta and short-patch repair to DNA polymerase beta.
