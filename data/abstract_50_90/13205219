Foreword. In summarizing this symposium, I expressed to our hosts, the Office of Naval Research and the University of Pennsylvania, our deep appreciation for their hospitality and for what all agreed was the great success and stimulation of this meeting. It was rather good to see Government, and particularly military science, tied up with civilian science. It was also good to see the applied so deeply woven with the theoretical. We were concerned, of course, on the one hand, with the enormously important specific problems of the antibiotics, herbicides, and insecticides, with drug resistance and addiction, with the development of resistance to epidemics due to bacteria and other organisms. Yet, on the other hand, these very practical matters do reduce, I think, to the general theory of the interaction of systems with their environment over the course of time; and this is a problem of microevoluition. So we were dealing, for those 2(1/2) days, with modern experiments in the general field of evolution.
