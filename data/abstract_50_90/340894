Retention or loss of the two new mitochondrial antimycin A resistance loci AI and AII has been analyzed in a large number of stable cytoplasmic petite mutants. Using these deletion mutants it was possible to localize the two antimycin A resistance loci in the OI--OII region of mitochondrial DNA. The genetic loci are mapped in the following order: OII--AI--AII--cobl--OI. The mapping relationship of mutants resistant to antimycin A or funiculosin to various cob mutants is described.
