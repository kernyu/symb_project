We have isolated 4 independent mutations affecting alpha-mannosidase-1, a developmentally regulated activity in Dictyrostelium discoideum. Three of these result in a thermolabile alpha-mannosidase-1 activity. One mutation also affects the substrate affinity (Km) of the activity. In diploids these mutations show a gene dosage effect and are all alleles. The structural gene for alpha-mannosidase-1, as defined by these mutations, defines a new linkage group, linkage group VI. alpha-mammosidase 1 is probably a homopolymer with subunits of 54,000 daltons. We have also mapped two temperature-sensitive-for-growth mutations onto two previously defined linkage groups.
