The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of 129 strains of genus Bacteroides, isolated from abscesses in pigs, for 13 different antimicrobial agents were determined by an agar-dilution method under anaerobic conditions. Clindamycin, the most active antibiotic tested, had a median MIC of 0.8 micrograms/ml. Penicillin G, talampicillin, minocycline, chloramphenicol, and cefoxitin also inhibited all isolates at lower concentrations. Some isolates of B pyogenes were susceptible to gentamicin (MIC, 0.4 micrograms/ml), erythromycin (MIC, 0.8 micrograms/ml), cephalexin (MIC, 0.8 micrograms/ml), and cefoxitin (MIC, 3.2 micrograms/ml). Erythromycin, at a concentration of 3.2 micrograms/ml, was active against 70% of B suis tested, but it was less active against the other Bacteroides species. Some strains tested were resistant to streptomycin and neomycin.
