Three herpes simplex virus mutants that contain drug resistance mutations in the DNA polymerase gene exhibited no significant reduction in replication in the ears of mice compared with the wild type after inoculation at that site but were attenuated for pathogenicity after intracerebral inoculation. Cataracts were common sequelae in mice that survived mutant infections.
