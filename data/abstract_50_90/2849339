The generation of LTB4 by peripheral blood neutrophils (PMN) isolated before and for as long as 6 h after exercise-induced asthma (EIA) has been analyzed. Three and 6 h after the development of EIA, PMN isolated from 10 asthmatic subjects and stimulated in vitro by 2 x 10(8) and 4 x 10(8) zymosan particles per 2 x 10(6) PMN demonstrated a 12- and 4-fold enhancement, respectively, in the production of immunoreactive LTB4 as compared with PMN isolated before exercise. At 6 h after EIA, there was a redistribution of generated LTB4 such that 30 to 40% of LTB4 produced by zymosan-activated PMN was released extracellularly as compared with 10% before exercise. There was no significant enhancement in the generation of LTB4 by unstimulated PMN at any time point after exercise. Resolution by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) of products from [3H]arachidonic-acid-labeled and zymosan-activated PMN demonstrated that, in addition to LTB4, there was enhanced metabolism to 6-trans-LTB4, omega-oxidation metabolites of LTB4 and 5-HETE. Stimulation of PMN with 10 microM A23187 revealed a 2-, 6-, and 5-fold enhancement in the production of LTB4, 6-trans-LTB4, and 5-HETE, respectively, at 6 h after EIA, as measured by integrated ultraviolet absorbance after HPLC. There was no significant enhancement in LTB4 generation by PMN in 6 asthmatic subjects after methacholine-induced bronchospasm, and after exercise in 6 subjects who did not develop asthma. The augmentation of PMN LTB4 generation in EIA correlated with the extent of the early decrease in SGaw.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
