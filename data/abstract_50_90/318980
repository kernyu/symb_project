We have treated 45 cases of urinary tract infection with cefazolin (i.m.) and cure was achieved in 35 (77.77%). 26 of the 28 patients (92.85%) with acute cystitis who received 250 mg every 12 h for 6-10 days were cured. 17 patients with pyelonephritis received 500 mg every 12 h during 10-14 days and therapeutical success was achieved in 9 of them (52.94%). Laboratory control was carried out at the initiation of therapy, at the end, and 1 month after therapy. Tolerance to injections of cefazolin was considered good and only in one case appeared a mild eosinophia.
