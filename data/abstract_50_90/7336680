The polypeptide composition of influenza A FPV (Hav1N1) and A/Texas/1/77 (H3N2) viruses which had acquired resistance to remantadine after serial passages in cell cultures in the presence of the drug was studied. It was found that in parallel with the acquired resistance to remantadine the molecular weight of the heavy chain of hemagglutinin changed only in the course of cell culture passages. The influenza A/Texas/1/77 virus passaged in chick embryos in the presence of remantadine exhibited no differences in the electrophoretic mobility of hemagglutinin between the sensitive and resistant variants. Remantadine is assumed to be an additional factor which influenza virus has to overcome in the process of adaptation to cell cultures.
