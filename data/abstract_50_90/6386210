Eighteen patients with Plasmodium falciparum infection were studied in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, to monitor the response of the malaria parasite to sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine. In all infections the parasitaemia was cleared rapidly following treatment with standard dose of the drug combination; no recrudescence was observed during follow-up periods of 1 week (4 patients) and 4 weeks (14 patients). Parallel in vitro tests indicated that 5 of the 16 isolates successfully tested were resistant to pyrimethamine alone.
