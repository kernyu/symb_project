Mortality occurs from a burn injury because of infections which result from the metabolic and bacterial consequences of a large open wound, depression of the host's resistance, and both protein and total caloric malnutrition. Systemic antibiotics, topical wound therapy, and gentle wound debridement constitute traditional burn therapy. The systemic antibiotics and topical wound therapy do not solve problems presented by large open wounds and the related protein and caloric deprivation. A more rational approach uses antibiotics and topical wound therapy only as adjuncts to a program of early operative removal or excision of the devitalized, burned tissue and immediate closure of the wound. The excised wound is normally closed with available autograft, but in massive burn injuries, donor skin is insufficient. In these massive injuries, artificial skin can provide that immediate wound closure. As long as devitalized, burned tissue remains present in the setting of depressed host resistance, cross infection tends to colonize those remaining devitalized burn wounds with more virulent organisms than those that were already present. Bacterial controlled nursing units (BCNU) provide strict protection against that cross infection. Though inevitably a catabolic response occurs with massive injury, intensive nutritional support provides the calories necessary for the response to injury to avoid a prolongation of that negative nitrogen balance.
