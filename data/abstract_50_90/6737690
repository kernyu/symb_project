Clinical and bacteriological efficiencies of cefoperazone (CPZ) in 19 serious infections associated with hematological malignancy were studied. CPZ was clinically effective in 13 cases (68.4%). Excellent effects were obtained in 3 cases (15.8%), good effects in 7 cases (36.8%) and fairly good effects in 3 cases (15.8%). The rate of clinical effectiveness by CPZ was not dependent on neutrophils number in peripheral blood. Bacteriological effectiveness to isolated organisms in 15 cases was obtained in 9 cases (60%). Clinically significant serum concentrations of CPZ persisted over 6 hours after injection (1 g/l hour, d.i.v.). In comparative study of MIC against clinically isolated P. aeruginosa, CPZ was superior to other cephalosporins. Adverse reactions were not significant except for 3 cases with abnormalities of hepatic function.
