In a large multicentre study, the susceptibility of 2171 bacterial isolates to ofloxacin and other antibiotics has been examined by the Kirby-Bauer method. Susceptibility to ofloxacin (breakpoint less than or equal to 2 mg/l) was observed in 99.2% of 1104 strains Enterobacteriaceae, 88.9% of 217 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 93.6% of 31 other Pseudomonas spp., 96.3% of 27 Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, 99.2% of 118 Haemophilus influenzae, 97.4% of 423 staphylococci, 79.4% of 107 Streptococcus faecalis and 98.7% of 142 other streptococci. There was no relationship between resistance to ofloxacin and resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics, aminoglycosides or other antibiotics tested within the same bacterial species.
