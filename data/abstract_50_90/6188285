The antibacterial activity of ten N-alkylated derivatives of daunorubicin and adriamycin as well as of 5-iminodaunorubicin has been tested by using Bacillus subtilis 170, Escherichia coli B, and Proteus mirabilis VI and their stable protoplast type L-forms in an agar diffusion test. Eight of the substances showed similar activities against B. subtilis and the L-forms of all test organisms, but no activity against the bacterial forms of E. coli and P. mirabilis. The cell wall of these gram-negative bacteria is responsible for this resistance by not allowing the antibiotics to enter the cells. The piperidino compound N-(CH2)5 daunorubicin shows 2-4 times higher activity against B. subtilis and all L-forms in comparison to daunorubicin and the other derivatives. Five of the substances were inactive against all test strains. Their inactivity seems to be associated with the larger substituents at the C-3' position. Relations between molecular structure and activity are discussed considering data about the interaction with DNA and the antitumor activity. Stable protoplast type L-forms and their bacterial forms represent a suitable and effective test system to screen for more effective substances and to get more information about their mode of action.
