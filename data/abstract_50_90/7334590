Cefroxadine (CGP-9000, CXD) is an orally active cephalosporin which has been newly developed by Ciba-Geigy. Its antibacterial activity against clinically isolated organisms, absorption and excretion after oral administration and clinical responses of patients with infections were studied. Its antibacterial activity against S. aureus and K. pneumoniae was comparable to that of CEX. Against E. coli, it showed slightly stronger activity than CEX. The serum concentrations of CXD was measured in 6 patients given orally 10 mg/kg of it after meals. The peak mean serum level attained 1 hour after administration was 11.66 mcg/ml. Forty-three children with various infections (upper respiratory infections, lower respiratory infections, urinary tract infections, etc.) were given 17 approximately 46 mg/kg (averaged 28.7 mg/kg) of CXD daily. The result was excellent in 26 cases, good in 12 cases, fair in 3 cases, fair in 3 cases and poor in 2 cases, showing an effective rate of 88.4%. Side effect of transient leukopenia and elevation of S-GOT were noticed in 2 cases. However, there were no serious adverse reactions in our study. It is concluded that CXD might be effective in rather mild cases of respiratory or urinary tract infections.
