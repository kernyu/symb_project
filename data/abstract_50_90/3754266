A total of 750 bacterial isolates, including 37 different species, were tested for susceptibility to BMY-28142 by standardized broth microdilution and disk diffusion tests. The zone diameter interpretive criteria tentatively suggested for the 30-micrograms BMY-28142 disk are as follows: susceptible = greater than or equal to 18 mm (MIC less than or equal to 8.0 micrograms/ml), resistant = less than or equal to 14 mm (MIC greater than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml), and indeterminate = 15 to 17 mm.
