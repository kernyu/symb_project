AT-2266 [1-ethyl-6-fluoro-1,4-dihydro-4-oxo-7-(1-piperazinyl)-1,8-naphthyridine-3-carbo xylic acid] showed a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative microorganisms, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The in vitro antibacterial activity of AT-2266 was in general comparable to that of norfloxacin, but much higher than that of pipemidic or nalidixic acid. The 90% minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC90s) of AT-2266 for P. aeruginosa resistant to gentamicin (MIC range, 25 to greater than 200 microgram/ml) and Enterobacteriaceae resistant to nalidixic acid (25 to greater than 1,600 micrograms/ml) were 3.13 and 12.5 micrograms/ml, respectively. The to nalidixic acid (25 to 1,600 micrograms/ml) were 3.13 and 12.5 micrograms/ml, respectively. The MICs of AT-2266 were only slightly affected by the addition of horse serum or sodium cholate, by the pH of the medium, and by inoculum size. AT-2266 was sodium cholate, by the pH of the medium, and by inoculum size. AT-2266 was bactericidal at concentrations near its MIC value. The 50% effective doses of AT-2266 after oral administration against systemic infections in mice were about 1/2 those of norfloxacin, about 1/10 those of pipemidic acid, and between 1/20 and 1/40 those of nalidixic acid.
