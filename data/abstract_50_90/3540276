Four furocoumarins, two having a linear structure (psoralen and 8-methyl-psoralen) and two having an angular structure (angelicin and 4,5'-dimethyl-angelicin), were studied for their mutagenic activity in the HGPRT system on V79 chinese hamster cells in culture (V79/HGPRT system). All the four drugs, when activated by near-ultraviolet (NUV) light, were effective in inducing HGPRT mutants. Their efficiency ranked in the following order: 8-methyl-psoralen greater than psoralen = 4,5-dimethylangelicin greater than angelicin.
