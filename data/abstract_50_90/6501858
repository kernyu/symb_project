Jirds were given a chemoprophylactic inoculation of flubendazole (FMBZ) and then five injections of infective larvae of Brugia pahangi whilst still protected by the FMBZ. When the drug was thought to be non-effective the jirds (and controls) were given a challenge infection of B. pahangi larvae. By comparison with control jirds the treated-infected-challenged jirds had 40% fewer adult worms. The control treated-challenged jirds contained mostly sterile female worms showing that they were still partially protected by FMBZ but worms numbers were not significantly reduced as compared with untreated controls.
