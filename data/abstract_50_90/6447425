The results of the phage typing of 5, 168 Staph. aureus strains isolated in a surgical hospital between 1959 and 1977 are analyzed for each year of this period. The wave of increase in the number of staphylococci belonging to phage group II which began, as discovered in this study, in 1965 and still showed no tendency towards decrease in 1977, as well as the periodicity of rises and falls in the number of staphylococci belonging to phage groups I and III are discussed and compared with the data contained in the literature. The authors come to the conclusion that Staph. aureus is subject to wave-like rises and falls in the number of strains belonging to the main phage groups of the species, and among them the strains belonging to phage groups I and III seem to be inversely related in respect of rises and falls in number, such changes occurring periodically at an interval of 10-12 years, while in the strains belonging to phage group II changes in number occur at a slower rate. The constant account of the percentage of phage groups I, II and III is recommended to ensure rational antibiotic therapy.
