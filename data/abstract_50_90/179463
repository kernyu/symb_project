A possibility of developing resistant forms of C1. perfringens during treatment of experimental anaerobic (gaseous) infection with lincomycin was studied. It was shown that treatment of the animals for 7 days resulted in an increase in the resistance by 33-41 times. It was noted that strains with decreased sensitivity to lincomycins had changed morphology and biochemical activity (decreased lecitinase activity, changed biochemical properties), decreased virulence and pathogenicity for animals. So as to obtain the protective effect of the antibiotics in experimental anaerobic (gaseous) infection caused by resistant variants of C1. perfringens it was necessary to increase 1.5-3 times the doses of lincomycin or chlolincocin as compared to the processes induced by sensitive strains.
