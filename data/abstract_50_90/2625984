Cigarette smoking in an enclosed environment produces a distinct unfavorable effect on infection resistance, reduces exercise tolerance and increases the morbidity rate. Smoking-induced decline of infection resistance manifests as inhibition of the level of defence reactions and decline of intracellular digestion. Disorders in the cellular component of nonspecific protection are aggravated by changes in antimicrobial resistance of the skin and local macrophagal immunity of the lungs. All this increases the general and infectious morbidity rate of smokers in an enclosed environment.
