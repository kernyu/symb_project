DNA replication in eukaryotic cells is closely associated with protein synthesis. When protein synthesis is specifically inhibited, DNA synthesis stops quickly too. No precise knowledge has been so far available concerning the reasons of this coupling. The data presented confirm an earlier established for Chlorella fact that the inhibition of DNA synthesis in L-cells, due to a several hours treatment with hidroxyurea, results in a consequent stability of DNA synthesis in these cells to a protein synthesis inhibitor--cyclohexamide.
