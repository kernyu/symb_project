Twenty-six strains of group JK corynebacteria had the same colonial morphology and biological reactions as the biotypes of the biovars of Corynebacterium genitalium and C. pseudogenitalium. Therefore, group JK corynebacteria can be assigned to the biovars of C. genitalium or C. pseudogenitalium. Although the strains differed in sensitivity to 16 antibiotics tested by Sensi-Discs or by the Micro-Media technique, they are uniformly sensitive to 4-5 micrograms/mL of vancomycin. Medium containing 10 micrograms vancomycin/mL was bactericidal and the killing time was dependent on the concentration. The rate of mutation to resistance to 10 micrograms vancomycin was greater than 1 in 10(10) corynebacteria. Therefore, vancomycin sensitivity is a stable characteristic of these corynebacteria which also indicates that group JK corynebacteria are strains of either C. genitalium or C. pseudogenitalium. Since group JK corynebacteria are considered pathogens, this finding supports the belief that C. genitalium is a pathogen and suggests that some biotypes of the commensal C. pseudogenitalium may infect compromised hosts.
