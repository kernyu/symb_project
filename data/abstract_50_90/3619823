Maduramicin ammonium was given at 2.5-8 ppm in the feed to broilers experimentally infected with coccidia recently isolated from broiler farms where ionophores had been used for several years. Infection pressure varied from mild to severe in five trials: mortality in unmedicated controls ranged from 0 to 59%, intestinal lesion scores were high, and weight gain was depressed by the infections. The cultures of Eimeria were partly resistant to ionophores: birds medicated with monensin at 100-121 ppm had only modest reductions in lesion scores and incomplete protection against weight loss or mortality. Control of infections by maduramicin was significant at 4 ppm but best at 5-7 ppm. Maduramicin was more effective than monensin or narasin, but about the same as salinomycin, in reducing lesions and mortality and in protecting performance. Maduramicin was well tolerated within the dose range of 5-7 ppm.
