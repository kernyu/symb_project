Strains of pneumococci moderately resistant to penicillin were recovered from three patients at the Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh during 1978. One of these children had meningitis and showed signs of early relapse despite high doses of penicillin G potassium. Routine screening of pneumococci for penicillin resistance is recommended.
