The relationships between rodent malarias were examined by means of DNA buoyant density determinations and DNA--DNA hybridization data. Current views of the existence in this group of four species: Plasmodium berghei, P. yoelli, P. vinckei and P. chabaudi were confirmed. The identity of two chloroquine-resistant lines derived from P. berghei N strain was established. One of these, the NS line, was found to be a subspecies of P. yoelii; the implications of this finding are discussed.
