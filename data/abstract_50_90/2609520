Samples of tumor tissue obtained from 47 patients with primary and metastatic breast cancer were implanted under the renal capsule of mice (SRCA-test) to assess individual sensitivity of these malignancies to cytostatics, recombinant interferon (rIFN) and--in some cases--to tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Primary tumor was shown to respond to cytostatics and rIFN in as few as 33.3 and 26.7% of cases, respectively. Xenografts of metastases displayed higher rates of response to all the drugs studied, viz. 64.2, 86.7 and 90% for cytostatics, rIFN and TNF, respectively.
