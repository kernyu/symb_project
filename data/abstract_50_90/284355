A 5.2-kilobase pair transposon, Tn551, has been found in Staphylococcus aureus, a Gram-positive bacterium. Initially detected on plasmid pI258, it undergoes rec-independent transposition to multiple chromosomal and plasmid sites, sometimes causing insertional inactivation. Unlike most other transposons, Tn551 undergoes apparently precise excision as a rule. The initial observation of Tn551 transition involved UV inactivation of the carrier plasmid; this would appear to be a general means of detecting transposable elements.
