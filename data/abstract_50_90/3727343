The effect of Ascaris suum infection and treatment with fenbendazole on the blastogenic response of peripheral blood lymphocytes to A. suum antigens and to three phytomitogens was assayed by the lymphocyte transformation technique. Repeated infections with A. suum led to the development of sensitized lymphocytes primarily responding to egg hatching fluid antigen. Treatment with fenbendazole decreased the number of specific sensitized lymphocytes, but favorably increased the resistance of pigs to reinfection. Immunity to reinfection did not correlate with the strength of the blastogenic response to A. suum antigens. Repeated infection with A. suum negatively affected the development of the blastogenic response to phytomitogens in the pigs, leading to a partial depression of the responsiveness of lymphocytes and to the partial suppression by serum. Responses to pokeweed mitogen were affected more than the responses to concanavalin A and phytohemagglutinin.
