A total of 42 multi-resistant urinary pathogens, sensitive to gentamycin only, were investigated with regard to the effects of dicloxacillin and ampicillin or cloxacillin/flucloxacillin and amoxycillin in combination. A synergistic antibiotic effect with resulting low MIC levels was demonstrated for 81% of the strains. It was also found that a further increase in sensitivity might be achieved by adjustment of the pH level.
