Effects of thymol (0.02-2 mM) on the electrical and mechanical activities of the smooth muscle cells of the guinea-pig taenia coli were investigated with either micro-electrode or double sucrose gap methods.1. Thymol, in a concentration of more than 0.03 mM, reduced the amplitude and maximum rate of rise of the spikes without any change of the membrane potential. When the concentration was increased to 0.3 mM, thymol completely blocked the spontaneous and evoked spike activities. In a concentration of more than 0.1 mM, thymol reduced the membrane resistance in proportion to the concentration without any change of the membrane potential.2. Ionic mechanisms involved in the effects of thymol on the membrane resistance were investigated in various ionic environments. The results showed that in concentrations below 0.5 mM thymol might selectively increase the Cl-conductance of the membrane. Participations of Na and K ion in the effects of thymol on the membrane resistance could be eliminated. However, at more than 1 mM, thymol increased the membrane conductance non-selectively. Excess Ca in the external solution partly suppressed the action of thymol on the taenia coli.3. Potentiation of the twitch tension was not observed on treatment with any concentration of thymol.4. After pre-treatment with thymol (0.5 mM), isotonic K Krebs solution depolarized the membrane and reduced the membrane resistance as observed in the absence of thymol. However, thymol completely suppressed the K-induced contracture.5. Application of excess Ca and acetylcholine during the maintained contracture evoked by isotonic K Krebs solution induced further development of the contracture. However, on pre-treatment with thymol, neither excess Ca nor acetylcholine could evoke a mechanical response in isotonic K Krebs solution.6. The results obtained from the present experiments are discussed in relation to the roles of Ca on the smooth muscle cells.
