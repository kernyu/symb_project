The authors have evaluated the incidence of Group A streptococci, and the prevalence of erythromycin-resistant strains in the years 1985/86/87 at the I.C.P. of Milan. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for erythromycin, penicillin and miocamycin of 40 erythromycin-resistant strains were also studied (MIC50-MIC90 = 4.5-8, 0.015-0.015, 0.041-0.186 micrograms/ml respectively). A clinical trial with miocamycin vs. erythromycin in the elimination of Group A streptococci (67 patients) showed good and comparable efficacy for both the antibiotics.
