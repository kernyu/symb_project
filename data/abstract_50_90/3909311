Throughout the antibiotic era, the emergence of drug-resistant bacteria has paralleled the development of new antimicrobial agents. As a result of selection pressures and invasive techniques that prolong the lives of seriously ill hospital patients, gram-negative bacilli have become the dominant causes of nosocomial infection. These microorganisms produce a diversity of antibiotic-inactivating enzymes. Moreover, the cell envelope of gram-negative bacteria provides a series of barriers that keep antibiotics from reaching their targets. Resistance factors can be transmitted among bacteria of different genera and species, thus conferring multidrug resistance. These problems continue to challenge scientists to better understand resistance mechanisms and to develop new compounds to circumvent them.
