Pigs of various age groups were found to have lyzozyme in all segments of the mucous membrane of the digestive tract, though typical Paneth's cells were absent. While no significant difference was found to exist between gastro-intestinal lyzozyme concentrations in store pigs, on the one hand, and sows, on the other, lyzozyme levels in piglets before weaning were found to differ by positions. Those in the distal jejunum were significantly higher than the proximal jejunum values, while the large intestine levels were below those of the ileum. The lyzozyme concentrations in all intestinal sections of store pigs were significantly in excess of those in piglets before weaning, all except for the stomach level. The proximal and distal jejunum and large intestine values and concentrations of that ferment in sows were lower than those in store pigs. Lyzozyme concentrations in the mucous membrane of the small intestine and in the lymph nodes of weaned piglets could not be raised by intraperitoneal nor oral immunisation, using Smd Escherichia coli mutants of serogroup O149:K91(B), K88ac. The above findings are discussed under the aspect of new insights into the importance of lyzozyme to local defence in the gastro-intestinal tract.
