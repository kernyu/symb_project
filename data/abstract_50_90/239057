Silica, an agent toxic for macrophages, administered i.v. to DBA/2 mice rapidly depresses the clearance of colloidal carbon by the reticuloendothelial system and reduces the in vitro phagocytic activity of peritoneal macrophages harvested 3 days after silica injection. Silica blocks the humoral immune response to sheep erythrocytes and the cell-mediated immune response to allogeneic fibroblasts when given before antigen. Silica also induces complex alterations in spleen cell responsiveness to concanavalin A involving both local and serum factors. Silica had no significant effect on the induction of interferon by statolon or Newcastle disease virus. No unequivocal evidence was obtained that silica has a direct depressive effect on cells other that macrophages, but indirect effects on lymphocytes were produced most likely by factors released from silica-lysed macrophages. Intravenous silica may prove useful for the separation of interferon induction and immune response stimulation in studies of host resistance to infection and oncogenesis. Considerable variation exists in the immunodepressive effects of different preparations of silica.
