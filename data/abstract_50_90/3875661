Two patients with prosthetic valve endocarditis due to methicillin-resistant Gram-positive cocci (Staphylococcus epidermidis and Micrococcus spp.) are described. They were successfully treated with rifampicin combined first with an aminoglycoside and later with co-trimoxazole or co-trimoxazole plus vancomycin. The addition of rifampicin to these antibiotics resulted in enhanced serum bactericidal activity. High doses of rifampicin (1200-1800 mg) for 7-8 weeks did not cause any serious side-effect. Surgery was not required. During surveillance for more than 2 years endocarditis did not recur.
