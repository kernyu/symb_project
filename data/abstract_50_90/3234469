Eight healthy volunteers received low doses of maprotiline and nomifensine up to 50 mg b.d. for 15 days in a double-blind, cross-over, placebo controlled study, during which echocardiography and psychomotor testing were carried out before and after the intake of alcohol 1 g/kg. Maprotiline increased heart rate and cardiac output and reduced peripheral resistance compared to placebo and nomifensine. Nomifensine alone was associated with a slight decrease in heart rate. Alcohol alone caused a significant increase in diastolic blood pressure, but did not otherwise modify the cardiovascular measures. The antidepressants did not augment the effects of alcohol. Antidepressants alone had no effect on psychomotor skills, but alcohol always impaired performance. No additional effects of alcohol were produced by the antidepressants. It appears that practically important peripheral or central consequences are unlikely to follow drinking a moderate amount of alcohol during regular therapy with low therapeutic doses of catecholamine reuptake inhibiting antidepressants. Experimental studies of the interaction of antidepressants and alcohol in patients with chronic heart disease seem to be justified.
