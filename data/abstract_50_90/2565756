This investigation was conducted to determine if Pasteurella haemolytica within feedlot cattle affected by pneumonic pasteurellosis express fimbriae (pili) and bacterial glycocalyx. Bacteriological culture of pulmonary tissue from three calves with fibrinous pneumonia resulted in heavy growth of P. haemolytica. Transmission electron microscopy of the lungs showed numerous microcolonies of gram-negative bacteria with morphology typical of Pasteurella haemolytica. The cells within these microcolonies possessed bacterial glycocalyces which stained with ruthenium red. Glycocalyx-encased microcolonies were also present in specimens examined by scanning electron microscopy. Typical P. haemolytica cells were evident in a tracheal specimen and these bacteria had radial glycocalyces consistent with polysaccharide and proteinaceous material condensed on linear structures suggestive of fimbriae. The pathogenetic importance of the bacterial glycocalyx and fimbriae in shipping fever pneumonia has yet to be established but their presence in clinical cases of Pasteurella pneumonia in feedlot cattle further supports a possible role in the initiation and progression of this disease as well as bacterial resistance to antimicrobial agents.
