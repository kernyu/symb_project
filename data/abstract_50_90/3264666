Enterococcal infections consistently account for approximately 10% of all nosocomial infections reported to the Centers for Disease Control. There is concern that an increase in nosocomial enterococcal infection is due to the increased severity of inpatient illnesses and to the widespread use of broad-spectrum beta-lactam antibiotics. Nosocomial enterococcal infections were analyzed at our medium-sized community hospital over a time period spanning 9 years. A significant increase in the infection rate was detected during the latter half of 1986. This increase was due primarily to a disproportionate rise in the incidence of the urinary tract as a site of infection. There were no associated clusters of infection, no predilection for certain patient care areas, and no preceding change in the hospital infection control policies and procedures. Total hospital use of cephalosporins remained stable during the period of increased enterococcal infections, but use of third-generation cephalosporins almost doubled in 1986 compared with the 4 preceding years. Selective pressure of third-generation cephalosporin use appeared to be a factor in the increased incidence of nosocomial enterococcal urinary tract infection.
