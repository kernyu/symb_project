The sensitivity of 6 antimicrobials (chloramphenicol, tetracycline, ampicillin, cephalothin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and ofloxacin) was tested on 174 bacteria isolated from three sources: 60 from wounds, 84 from urine and 30 from bronchial excretions. Hospital-borne bacteria were compared to those of non-hospital origin for their susceptibility. Consecutively, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (24 strains), Escherichia coli (58), Klebsiella sp. (13), Enterobacter sp. (3), Citrobacter sp. (3), Enterococcus sp. (25) and Staphylococcus sp. (48) were tested. With the exception of 7.1% of bacteria (Enterococcus) isolated from urine, 96.6% of all strains tested were sensitive to ofloxacin.
