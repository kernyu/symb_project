A study was performed to assess the suppressive effect of ciprofloxacin on the aerobic gram-negative flora of the gastrointestinal tract in mice in relation to its effect on colonization resistance. Ciprofloxacin exhibited a potent decontaminating effect, with the maximum effect being reached at a dose of 8 mg/kg/day. At this dose aerobic gram-negative rods were eliminated from the gastrointestinal tract within 24h without any adverse influence on the parameters of colonization resistance measured.
