Six independent mutant lines of Nicotiana plumbaginifolia resistant to ethanol, designated E3, E8, E101, E112, E144 and E251, were isolated as germinating seedlings on selective medium. In all cases, resistance to ethanol was conferred by a single recessive nuclear mutation at the same locus. Mutant seeds and pollen lacked detectable ADH activity, with the exception of E251 where a residual activity was detected. An antiserum directed against Arabidopsis thaliana ADH detected an ADH-related polypeptide of 44 kDa present in wild-type seeds and, to a lesser extent, in the seeds of the leaky mutant E251. No ADH-related polypeptide could be detected in seeds of the other mutants. However, all of them had a nearly normal level of ADH mRNA except one which did not synthesize any mRNA. These results suggest that these ethanol-resistant mutants are impaired in one of the structural genes coding for alcohol dehydrogenase. The corresponding locus has been designated Adh1.
