Ampicillin resistance (minimal inhibitory concentration >/=10 mug/ml) in the absence of beta-lactamase activity by Haemophilus influenzae was noted in tests performed with Mueller-Hinton agar containing one lot of supplement C. All strains, except five with known resistance due to beta-lactamase activity, were inhibited by 0.6 mug or less of ampicillin per ml of chocolatized blood agar.
