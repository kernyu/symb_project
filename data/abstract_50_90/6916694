The reports of outpatients with surgical infections of the years 1972 and 1977 are compared to demonstrate changes in composition of the spectrum and resistance to antibiotics. In the first period 425 cases could be used for study, in the second only 132 cases could be traced. In the second period phlegmonous infections, caused by streptococci were twice as frequent as in 1972. In the same year resistance of staphylococci to Penicillin was found in 43% of the cases. Five years later no more resistance was present and in 28,8% Penicillin even proved to be the most efficient drug. Likewise the streptococci had become more sensitive to Penicillin in the second period, but Cephalosporin remained the treatment of choice for this type of infections. Gram negative germs as B. coli were found much less in 1977 than five years before and their sensibility to sulfamethoxazol-trimethoprim was remarkably higher. The study demonstrates the changes in antibiotic resistance of a given germ population as well as the need for close observation of these changes. Standard antibiotic treatment has to be adapted to the modifications of germ behavior.
