Streptomycin sensitivity of 112 Leptospira strains isolated from domestic and wild animals was studied. Independent of the isolation period and nature the strains proved to be highly sensitive to the antiobiotic (MIC 0.1 to 0.5 gamma/ml). On the example of a clone strain of Leptospira it was shown with a fluctuation test that streptomycin resistance occurred spontaneously. Frequency of the streptomycin resistant mutations was determined for 5 clone strains of L. interrogans. It was 10-9 to 10-7 per a Leptospira.
