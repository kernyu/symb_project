Sensitivity of 147 Enterobacteria strains isolated from feces of various patients was determined with the method of serial dilutions on solid nutrient media. 8 antibiotics were tested. By genera (species) the microorganisms were arranged in the following order: E. coli (65 strains), Citrobacter (33 strains), E. cloacae (15 strains), Serratia liquefaciens (9 strains), Hafnia (6 strains), Klebsiella (4 strains), Pectobacterium (3 strains), non-identified organisms (13 strains). The majority of the strains were resistant to levomycetin (chloramphenicol), morphocycline, tetracycline and tetraolean and at the same time sensitive to streptomycin, neomycin, monomycin and kanamycin. 18 combinations of resistance were found. Repeated examinations of the specimens from the same patient revealed changes in the species composition of the cultures and subsequently in the antibiotic sensitivity spectrum.
