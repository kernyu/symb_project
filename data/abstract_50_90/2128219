The article reviewed 279 cases of pneumonia which came from two different periods. Among these 116 got from 1960s and 174, from 1980s. We analyzed the general condition of patients, etiology, mortality, prognosis and management and reached to the conclusion that (1) gram-negative bacilli become major pathogen in replace of Gram-positive staphylococcus aureus in 1980s, but staphylococcus aureus pneumonia is still a serious disease (2) the prognosis of the patient is related to underlying disease, nourishment and complication (3) at present, Cephalosporin V is most effective in Gram-positive cocci pneumonia and Gentamycin or Cephalosporin V, in Gram-negative bacilli pneumonia. (4) the mortality rate of pneumonia in 1980s is lower than that in 1960s.
