Mutants of Bacillus subtilis with altered deoxyribonucleic-dependent ribonucleic acid polymerase activity have been isolated and characterized. These mutants, selected as strains resistant to rifampin or streptolydigin, demonstrate drug-resistant in vitro ribonucleic acid synthesis. Sporeforming ability and support of phage infection are altered in many of the mutants. Mutations to rifampin and streptolydigin resistance have been located on the B. subtilis chromosome and ordered relative to the markers cysA14 and str.
