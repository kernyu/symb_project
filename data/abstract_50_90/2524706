We report the case of an immunocompromised patient with AIDS in whom developed a perioral and several intraoral HSV 2 lesions that persisted for more than 1 year. The virus was resistant to acyclovir but was sensitive to foscarnet. Viral isolates were thymidine kinase negative. The lesions resolved with intravenous foscarnet therapy given over a 15-week period, and when last seen, 8 months after foscarnet was discontinued, the patient had not had a recurrence.
