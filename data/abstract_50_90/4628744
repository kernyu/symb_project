Incompatibility between R factors has been reported by several authors, and four incompatibility groups have already been described by Datta and Hedges among Rfi(-) factors. The stability of 12 plasmids in pairs was studied after 116 crosses, and five new groups were found, designated 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. Each plasmid studied belongs to one single group. Incompatibility between plasmids in pairs is a clear-cut phenomenon, is easy to observe, and can provide a reliable method for recognizing and classifying resistance factors, and for tracing their spread among bacterial species.
