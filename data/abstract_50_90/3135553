Paramyosin (Sm97), a 97-kDa myofibrillar protein identified by the unusually monospecific antibody response induced by intradermal vaccination of mice with a complex soluble worm antigen preparation (SWAP) of adult Schistosoma mansoni administered with bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG), was purified and tested for its capacity to protect mice against challenge infection. When administered intradermally with BCG at total doses of only 4-40 micrograms per mouse, both the native molecule and a recombinant expression product containing approximately 50% of the whole protein were found to confer significant resistance (26-33%) against challenge infection, while 2 mg of unfractionated SWAP was required to induce similar levels of protection. In addition, paramyosin was shown to stimulate T lymphocytes from vaccinated mice to produce lymphokines [e.g., gamma interferon (IFN-gamma)] that activate macrophages to kill schistosomula. Neither schistosome myosin nor a heterologous paramyosin from a different invertebrate genus were protective, indicating a requirement for specific epitopes in the immunization. That the protection induced by paramyosin involves a T-cell-mediated mechanism was supported by the failure of anti-paramyosin antibodies to passively transfer significant resistance to infection to recipient mice. Lymphocytes from mice vaccinated with paramyosin were found to produce IFN-gamma in response to living schistosomula, suggesting that during challenge infection of vaccinated hosts, paramyosin (a nonsurface antigen) may elicit a protective T-cell response as a consequence of its release from migrating parasite larvae. Paramyosin-depleted SWAP was also found to be protective as well as stimulatory for T lymphocytes from SWAP-vaccinated mice, indicating that other antigens in this preparation may have immunoprophylactic potential. In summary, these results (i) suggest that the induction of T-cell-dependent cell-mediated immunity against soluble nonsurface antigens may be an effective strategy for immunization against multicellular parasites and (ii) in the case of schistosomes, identify paramyosin as a candidate vaccine immunogen in this category.
