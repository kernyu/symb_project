A test system that uses infective gametocytes from in vitro cultures was developed for evaluating the sporontocidal activity of antimalarial compounds. In evaluating the system, pyrimethamine and cycloguanil (dihydrofolate reductase inhibitors) and primaquine (8-aminoquinoline) were tested against pyrimethamine-sensitive and pyrimethamine-resistant strains of Plasmodium falciparum. The drugs were administered to Anopheles either in a blood meal containing infective gametocytes or in a noninfective meal 2-4 days later. The mosquitoes were dissected 9-10 days after they received the infective blood meal, and the sporontocidal effect of the drugs was evaluated by the number of oocysts found in the gut. Both cycloguanil and pyrimethamine had marked sporontocidal activity. The susceptibility pattern of the strains to the sporontocidal effect of pyrimethamine and cycloguanil was similar to the susceptibility of their asexual blood stages in vitro to the schizontocidal effect of the compounds. The sporontocidal effect was observed only when the compounds were administered at the same time as the infective blood meal, but not when they were given 2-4 days later. No sporontocidal activity was observed with primaquine. This system permits more reliable quantitative observations than have been possible with previous methods.
