34 case-reports of type RI resistance of P. falciparum to chloroquine published between 1975 and 1982 are reviewed. The patients were non-immune travellers infected in East Africa and in the neighbouring islands, especially Tanzania, Kenya and Madagascar. The increase in number and level of resistance might be a problem in Africa. A monitoring system of the patient and in the field is proposed and the possibilities of prevention and control are discussed.
