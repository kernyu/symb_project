We report the results of a study carried out upon samples of urine from 19,021 patients in various departments of medical school in Sassari and in the hospitals of Alghero and Ozieri. The 34.7% of samples examined proved to be positive. Among these we isolated Escherichia coli (32%), Proteus spp. (24%), Staphylococcus (12%), Klebsiella-Enterobacter-Serratia (KES) spp. (9%), Pseudomonas spp. (5%). We found microbic associations in 11% of cases. We also studied the sensitivity of microorganisms to various chemoantibiotics, and the efficacy of therapy on 964 patients. In the various checks made, the results point out a persisting positivity (53%). E. coli strains show a major sensitivity to the various antibiotics (aminoglycosides, quinolones, cephalosporins, etc.); Proteus spp. and KES are less sensitive; Pseudomonas spp. strains are very resistant and respond mainly to norfloxacin and ceftazidime.
