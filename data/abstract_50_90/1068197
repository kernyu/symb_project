The Alice strain of live attenuated influenza virus was obtained by selection of a gamma inhibitor-resistant strain from a virus recombinant between A/PR/8/34 (HON1) and A/England/42/72 (H3N2). Its behaviour in vitro and in vivo was studied. Three marker systems were investigated: resistance to serum inhibitors, growth capacity at high temperature and low sensitivity to amantadine hydrochloride. In ferrets the strain was found to be attenuated and immunogenic. Passages in man, animals and eggs have not affected its resistance to gamma inhibitors.
