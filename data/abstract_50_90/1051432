1. When gentamicin (GM) and sulbenicillin (SBPC) or cephacetrile (CEC), in combination with pre- or post-treatment, were injected intravenously to the rat, their pharmacokinetics were investigated. 2. The antibiotics in the samples were separated by paper electrophoretic technique and their concentrations were determined by cup thin layer plate method using Bacillus subtilis as the test organism. 3. The biological half-life of SBPC in the serum was shortened in pretreatment with GM and prolonged in posttreatment with GM, while that of GM did not vary in pre- or post-treatment with SBPC. 4. The half-life of CEC was prolonged in treatment with GM, while that of GM did not vary. 5. These phenomena may be considered to be produced as the results of a concentration ratio of SBPC and GM or of CEC and GM, and protein binding of these antibiotics, as far as plasma initial levels, tissue distribution, urinary excretion and protein binding of these antibiotics are concerned.
