Resistance of Escherichia coli to trimethoprim (TMP)-sulfamethoxazole remains at 3%-8% at many medical centers within the United States. In this study a 44% resistance rate was observed among E. coli isolated at a pediatric hospital in Santiago, Chile, and a 40% resistance rate at a general teaching hospital in Bangkok, Thailand. Most isolates were from urinary tract infections and showed high-level resistance (minimal inhibitory concentration of TMP greater than 1,000 micrograms/ml). Nineteen of 35 isolates tested transferred resistance to TMP; most cotransferred resistance to streptomycin and sulfonamides. Dihydrofolate reductase type I was detected by gene probing in 14 of 35 strains. Subsequent investigations in Brazil, Honduras, and Costa Rica revealed that this high rate of resistance was not an isolated phenomenon.
