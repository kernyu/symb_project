Eleven 4''-O-acyltylosin derivatives were synthesized and subjected to a two-step screening system consisting of antimicrobial activity and esterase stability assays. The new derivatives were all active against macrolide-resistant Staphylococci and mycoplasmas, but only 4''-O-(4-methoxy)phenylacetyltylosin and 4''-O-(4-acetyl)phenylacetyltylosin showed better resistance to mouse liver esterase than 4''-O-phenylacetyltylosin (reference compound C).
