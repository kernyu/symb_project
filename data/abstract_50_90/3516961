Anaerobic digestion of night soil with cattle dung slurry in biogas plants is advocated in Indian villages as a means of disposal of human excreta in the absence of conventional sanitary systems. Although intestinal pathogens are likely to be eliminated during anaerobic digestion, there is no conclusive evidence that this is so. Large numbers of saprophytic organisms in the fermenting mass make it impossible to detect the residual pathogens. Use of an antibiotic-resistant strain of Salmonella typhimurium as a test organism to study its survival during anaerobic digestion showed that the organism is totally eliminated in nine days.
