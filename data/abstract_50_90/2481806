We have used 160 kilobases of cloned Drosophila genomic DNA from the rudimentary (r) region to examine the organization of amplified DNA in Drosophila cells resistant to 10 mM N-(phosphonacetyl)-L-aspartate (PALAr cells) obtained by stepwise selection. Evidence for the direct tandem linkage of the amplified sequences is presented. The pattern and intensity of amplified bands as well as the presence of novel junctions in the DNA sequence of PALAr cells indicate that there are two types of units of 150 and 120 kilobases long. The sequence of the smaller unit is entirely included within the larger one. The longer of the two units is present twice while the shorter one is amplified eightfold as compared to the level of the relevant DNA sequences in the wild-type. These data are consistent with a model in which successive crossing-over events over several cell cycles lead to amplification of the selected r gene and flanking sequences. However, these data can also be accounted for by a totally different mechanism in which multiple copies of DNA are generated by rolling circle replication. Transcription units other than the r gene are present within the 150 kilobase region of amplified DNA. These are found to be overexpressed in PALAr cells, though some transcripts are underrepresented relative to the copy number of the corresponding coding sequences.
