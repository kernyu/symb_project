A new shuttle cosmid vector, pKC505, was constructed for the cloning of Streptomyces DNA. This vector, which can be conjugally transferred between different streptomycetes, was used to construct a genomic library from a spiramycin-producing S. ambofaciens strain. By transformation of the spiramycin-sensitive S. griseofuscus with the library, three phenotypically different spiramycin-resistance genes were isolated. S. ambofaciens DNA in these clones was colinear with the chromosome, and the cloned DNA was stable in E. coli, S. griseofuscus and S. fradiae. These cosmids could be isolated easily from S. griseofuscus, an improvement over the previous shuttle cosmid vector, pKC462a [Stanzak et al., Bio/Technology 4 (1986) 229-232], which was somewhat difficult to isolate from S. lividans.
