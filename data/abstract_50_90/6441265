A total of 184 men with uncomplicated gonococcal urethritis were treated with a single oral dose of rifampicin 900 mg and erythromycin stearate 1 gm. The cure rate on day 3 was 95.1%, 175 were cured and 9 failed (4.9%). Of all the Neisseria gonorrhoeae isolated, 86 were PPNG (46.7%). There was no difference in failure rate among patients with PPNG or with non-PPNG. With the exception of self-limited gastrointestinal disturbance, side effects were minimal. The value of this combination for the treatment of uncomplicated gonococcal urethritis in men is promising and deserves further study.
