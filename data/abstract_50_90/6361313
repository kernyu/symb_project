Since 1979 the antibacterial activity of antibiotics against E. coli, Klebsiella, Citrobacter and Proteus isolated from patients with urinary tract infections has been investigated. The serious transition of susceptibilities of E. coli and Klebsiella could not be recognized in these antibiotics (MPC, ABPC, NA, PPA, CEX, CEZ, CTM, CMZ and CFX). However, a few resistant organisms against the third generation's antibiotics (CTX, CMX, CZX, LMOX and CPZ) have already been appeared, we have to observe these results, continuously.
