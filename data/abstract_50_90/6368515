A high proportion of nitrofuran-resistant strains has been found in a collection of antibiotic-resistant Gram-negative bacteria isolated from patients with urinary tract infections. Some of the Escherichia coli carried R-plasmids that conferred resistance to nitrofurantoin and nitrofurazone. The mechanism of resistance is not clear; only in lactose non-fermenting recipients was there a decrease in the nitrofuran-reducing ability of whole-cell suspensions. One of the plasmids conferred enhanced resistance to UV light on DNA repair defective mutants but not on repair efficient strains. In some resistant strains, the total resistance was apparently the result of a combination of chromosomal and plasmid-borne genes. The presence of the plasmid may allow the development of higher resistance levels by mutation of chromosomal genes.
