A modification of the Colowick and Womack procedure for measuring ligand binding by macromolecules is described for drug binding by bacteria. This technique is based on the determination of drug concentration in the dialysate from a bacteria-drug mixture at equilibrium. The dialysis cell of the original procedure was replaced by a Minibeaker (Bio-Rad), which has a larger membrane surface area, and the dialysate was continuously monitored with a spectrophotometer equipped with a flow cell. With this system, only 3 min was required to determine the amount of cetylpyridinium chloride bound by Escherichia coli K-12 strain P678. Possible applications of the technique are discussed.
