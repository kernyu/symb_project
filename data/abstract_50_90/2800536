A serial of completely defined agar media suitable for growth of the common mycobacteria which are pathogenic was reported in this paper. A tool was supplied for the study of mycobacteria on nutrition and physiology, biochemical feature, genetics and variation and on the mechanism of resistance and susceptibility to antimicrobial drug, and with it would be in favour of developing more satisfactory media for mycobacteria. The majority of strains of the mycobacteria tested grew more rapidly on the completely defined agar media than on Lowenstein-Jensen medium and the final yield of the microbes on the agar media was less than or equal to those on Lowenstein-Jensen medium. There were only small amounts of growing cells on the completely defined agar media among the strain of mycobacterium bovis. Tcolonies with the above mentioned twodifferent patterns were found to grow on the completely defined media from mycobacterium avium. M. intracclluare and M. fortuitum.
