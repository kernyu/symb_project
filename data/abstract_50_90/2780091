The bactericidal activity of LY 146032 (LY), Oxacillin (OXA), Cefamandole (CEF), Rifampin (RIF), Gentamicin (GEN) or Tobramycin (TOB), Pefloxacin (PEF), Vancomycin (VAN), Teicoplanin (TEI), Pristinamycin (PRI) was compared against 8 strains of S. aureus (4 Meth. sensitive, 4 Meth. resistant). Kill Kinetics studies were done: bacteria were incubated with antibiotics at their MICs, 2 X MIC, 4 X MIC and at concentrations obtained in vivo with usual therapeutic doses. With 4 X MIC, a 3 Log reduction of the initial inoculum was observed only at 24 h with OXA, CEF (MSSA), RIF, PEF, VAN, at 30 h with TEI and PRI. With LY, GEN or TOB at 2 X MIC the 3 Log reduction was observed at 3 h or 4 h, a greater than or equal to 5 Log reduction at 24 h: LY and Aminoglycosides are the most bactericidal antibiotics against S. aureus.
