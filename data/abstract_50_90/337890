Cultures of Escherichia coli were exposed to nalidixic acid in an in vitro model in which the conditions of drug-organism interaction resembled those of bacterial cystitis treatment. Results obtained in this way suggested that emergence of bacterial resistance should not be a major problem in treatment of uncomplicated urinary infection; such cases might indeed respond to a less intensive course of treatment than is usual. More prolonged, high-dosage therapy with nalidixic acid may be required for patients with more complicated infections if the risk of failure from the emergence of bacterial resistance is to be minimized.
