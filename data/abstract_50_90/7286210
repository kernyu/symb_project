An original antibacterial drug dioxidine was subjected to toxicological studies during long-term parenteral administration of 0.5% solution to rats and guinea-pigs (in doses of 25-100 mg/kg). It was found that susceptibility to the drug correlated well with adrenal function. Guinea-pigs were more susceptible to dioxidine than rats. The data obtained indicate the existence of the interplay between non-specific resistance to toxic agents and glucocorticoid potency.
