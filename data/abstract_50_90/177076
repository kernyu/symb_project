An NADH dehydrogenase possessing a specific activity 3-5 times that of membrane-bound enzyme was obtained by extraction of Acholeplasma laidlawii membranes with 9.0% ethanol at 43 degrees C. This dehydrogenase contained only trace amounts of iron (suggesting an uncoupled respiration), a flavin ratio of 1:2 FAD to FMN and 30-40% lipid. Its resistance to sedimentation is probably due to the high flotation density of the lipids. It efficiently utilized ferricyanide, menadione and dichlorophenol indophenol as electron acceptors, but not O2, ubiquinone Q10 or cytochrome c. Lineweaver-Burk plots of the dehydrogenase were altered to linear functions upon extraction with 9.0% ethanol. A secondary site of ferricyanide reduction could not be explained by the presence of cytochromes, which these membranes lack. In comparison to other respiratory chain-linked NADH dehydrogenases in cytochrome-containing respiratory chains, this dehydrogenase was characterized by similar Km's with ferricyanide, dichlorophenol indophenol, menadione as electron acceptors, but considerably smaller V's with ferricyanide, dichlorophenol indophenol, menadione as electron acceptors, and smaller specific activities. It was not stimulated or reactivated by the addition of FAD, FMN, Mg2+, cysteine or membrane lipids, and was less sensitive to respiratory inhibitors than unextracted enzyme. The ineffectiveness of ADP stimulation on O2 uptake, the insensitivity to oligomycin and the very low iron content of A. laidlawii membranes were considered in relation to conservation of energy by these cells. Some kinetic properties of the dehydrogenation, the uniquely high glycolipid content and apparently uncoupled respiration at Site I were noteworthy characteristics of this NADH dehydrogenase from the truncated respiratory chain of A. laidlawii.
