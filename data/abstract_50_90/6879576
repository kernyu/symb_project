Resistance of nematodes to anthelmintics is being increasingly observed throughout the world in recent years. Benzimidazole-resistance of Haemonchus contortus is also observed in the Netherlands. There are a number of methods to detect resistance to anthelmintics of which only the in vitro techniques can be used to detect resistance in the field. Factors such as dosage, frequency of treatment and the time of treatment may affect resistance.
