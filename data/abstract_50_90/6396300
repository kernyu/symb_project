Mitochondrial DNA of an erythromycin-resistant petite mutant of yeast, E734, showed physical maps of inversion, which occurred between two cross-over sites in the fragments Hae A and Hae B. The pair of cross-over sites was inferred to be accommodated within a repeat unit of E734 mtDNA during petite mutation by joining two fragments excised from non-adjacent region of wild type mtDNA.
