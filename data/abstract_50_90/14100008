A study has been made of the antibiotic sensitivity pattern of 96 strains of Proteus isolated from clinical material and a further 29 strains kindly supplied by Dr. Patricia Carpenter. The results have been analysed in relation to the different species. The effect of electrolytes on the penicillin sensitivity of Proteus species has also been examined.
