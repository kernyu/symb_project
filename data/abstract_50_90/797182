Strains of E. coli, mainly from Chinese patients in Hong Kong with urinary tract infections, were serotyped, biotyped, and their antibiotic resistance patterns determined. The most common O groups found were O1, O2, O4, O6, O7, O8, O21, O25 AND O82. In general, they carried flagellar antigens different from those normally associated with these O groups in Europe. A variety of biotypes was observed and many strains were resistant to a number of antimicrobial drugs.
