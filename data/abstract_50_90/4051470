Fifty-nine strains of gram-negative non-sporulating anerobic bacteria were identified to the genus. Comparison of the data on the biochemical identification with the phenotypes by sensitivity to antibiotics and bile showed, that the bacteroids of the fragilis group had the same phenotype. Sensitivity was determined with anaerodisks impregnated with antibiotics and bile. The other species of bacteroids and fusobacteria had several phenotypes. However, these phenotypes being non-specific for the species were characteristic of the genus: none of the bacteroid species had the fusobacteria phenotype. The presented table of the bacteroid and fusobacteria phenotypes by sensitivity to antibiotics and bile may be useful in identification of these organism.
