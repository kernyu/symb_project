Lincomycin, a chemically new antibiotic effective against Gram-positive organisms, was evaluated in vitro and tested clinically. In vitro testing indicated that lincomycin is especially effective against Staphylococcus aureus. Clinical testing showed that lincomycin was free of toxicity in a series of 18 cases of staphylococcal infection. Of particular interest was its pronounced effectiveness in nine cases of chronic osteomyelitis, one of which was of 15 years' duration and unresponsive to all other forms of antibiotic and surgical treatment. The only side effect noted was loose stools in the occasional patient.
