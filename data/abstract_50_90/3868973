Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and the genetically-related oral haemophili (Haemophilus segnis, Haemophilus aprhophilus and Haemophilus paraphrophilus) exhibit a range of sensitivities to the lethal effect of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), A. actinomycetemcomitans being the most resistant. To extend this information, susceptibility to a range of H2O2 concentrations (10(-6)-10(-3) M) was assessed by incubating bacterial suspensions for 1 h at 37 degrees C in the presence of H2O2 and spreading the suspensions on chocolate agar plates to determine the concentration of H2O2 producing a 50 per cent reduction in colony-forming units (LD50). Catalase activity was quantified with a Clark-type oxygen electrode, which polarographically monitored the formation of dissolved oxygen in bacterial suspensions or sonicates following addition of reagent H2O2. Sensitivity to H2O2 did not correlate with catalase activity, either in intact cells or in bacterial sonicates. Specifically, some bacterial strains with undetectable catalase activity were highly resistant to H2O2. Micromolar concentrations of sodium azide which completely inhibited cell-associated catalase activity did not affect the resistance of A. actinomycetemcomitans to H2O2. Thus, the endogenous catalase activity of A. actinomycetemcomitans and certain oral haemophili is not an important determinant of resistance to the bactericidal effects of H2O2.
