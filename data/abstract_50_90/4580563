The tolE mutation causes tolerance to colicins E2 and E3 as well as other effects on the phenotype of Escherichia coli K-12. The lipopolysaccharide of the mutant shows a reduction in the content of galactose, glucose, and rhamnose. The phenotype of the mutant, including the composition of the lipopolysaccharide, is suppressed by galactose. The map position is shown by the gene order trp-purB-tolE-tolD-galKETO.
