Matings of a number of Saccharomyces cerevisiae stocks give different output ratios of mitochondrial genotypes depending on whether the cells are glucose-repressed or derepressed. The effects of glucose repression are independent of cellular mating type and mitochondrial genotype, and take place at least in part after zygotes are formed. An explanation is proposed in terms of changes in the relative numbers of mitochondrial DNA molecules contributed by the a and alpha parents, modified by selective replication or destruction of molecules inside the zygote.
