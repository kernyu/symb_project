Three initial treatment schedules of peritonitis during continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis are analysed. In 20 patients 56 episodes of peritonitis were treated by co-trimoxazole, 29 episodes in 20 patients by cefazolin, and 29 infections in 22 patients by vancomycin. The efficiency of the treatment modes was comparable. Vancomycin was found to be appropriate in particular because of the resistance characteristics of bacterial isolates.
