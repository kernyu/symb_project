Combinations of antimicrobial agents are most often used to provide empiric broad spectrum coverage. Other potential reasons for combination therapy include treatment of polymicrobial infections, to enhance killing or inhibition (synergism), to reduce the potential for developing resistance, and less commonly to allow reduction in the dose of a toxic agent. However, combination regimens are often used unnecessarily and can result in increased side effects, costs, and other undesirable effects.
