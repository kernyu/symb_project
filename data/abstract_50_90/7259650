Following the apparent failure of levamisole to control infections of Haemonchus contortus in sheep at Lawes in south eastern Queensland, a strain of this parasite was isolated at the Animal Research Institute, Yeerongpilly. This strain was used to infect sheep at Yeerongpilly and the Merrindale Research Station, Victoria where four experiments to classify the resistance pattern of the parasite were carried out. Resistance to thiabendazole was first suspected in 1969, and these experiments confirmed that resistance to this drug was still present. They also showed that a strong degree of resistance had been developed to both levamisole and morantel tartrate. Other benzimidazole anthelmintics and also the organophosphorus compound naphthalophos were only moderately effective against the original isolate but rafoxanide, nitroxynil and phenothiazine were almost 100% effective. Other highly effective chemicals were disophenol and closantel. After passaging the strain for four generations with both levamisole and albendazole, resistance to both naphthalophos and the newer benzimidazole anthelmintics increased dramatically. This is the first report of a field strain of H. contortus exhibiting resistance to benzimidazole, non-benzimidazole and organophosphorus anthelmintics.
