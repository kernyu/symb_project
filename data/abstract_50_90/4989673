Seventy-eight of 420 clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa yielded zones of inhibition of less than 12 mm in diameter around 10-mug discs of gentamicin sulfate when tested by the standardized Bauer-Kirby disc diffusion method. Of 153 strains chosen from these isolates, one strain (0.65%) required 25 mug of gentamicin per ml for inhibition; the remainder (99.35%) were inhibited by 6 mug/ml or less of the antibiotic. It is recommended that those isolates of P. aeruginosa that yield zones of inhibition less than 12 mm in diameter be disc susceptibility-tested once more; those isolates that give zones of inhibition of less than 12 mm upon repeated examination should then be subjected to the broth dilution test before they are designated as sensitive or resistant to gentamicin.
