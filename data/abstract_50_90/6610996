A total of 967 isolates of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria were tested for the production of beta-lactamase by the PADAC test strip, and the results were compared with acidometric, disk diffusion and antibiotic dilution procedures. All the penicillinase producting strains of gonococci (23) and Haemophilus influenzae (36) gave positive results with PADAC, but the 361 isolates of Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis remained negative. All of the 547 strains of penicillin sensitive strains of gonococci, Haemophilus and staphylococci were negative with PADAC test.
