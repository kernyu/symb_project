Experiments on the laboratory cultures of lice infected by Weigl's method revealed that the spontaneous, erythromycin-resistant mutant of R. prowazekii strain E, adapted to the vector's organism, retained its resistance to erythromycin during 50 successive passages without the maintenance concentrations of this antibiotic. The above strain remained sensitive to tetracycline and levomycetin. Its level of sensitivity to the latter antibiotics was similar to that of R. prowazekii strains cultivated in the vector's organism for a long time.
