The main bacteria causing urinary tract infections in children we found: Enterobacteriaceae (75%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (11,8%), Staphylococcus albus K- (5%) and Streptococcus faecalis (4%). Antibiotic sensitivity of 1362 strains of bacteria isolated from urinary tract of children treated in National Research Institute of Mother and Child in 1979-1981 were evaluated. Sensitivity on 12 chemiotherapeutics were checked. Aminoglycoside antibiotics: tobramycin and gentamycin were found as the most efficient ones. Over 50% of bacteria strains showed sensitivity on negram, nitrofurantoin, colimycin, cephradin and carbenicillin. Fewest bacteria strains gave evidence of penicillin, ampicillin, biseptol and vibramycin sensitivity.
