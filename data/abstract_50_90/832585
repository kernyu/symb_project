Investigation of the resistance of 290 strains of the Klebsiella-Enterobacter group (252 Klebsiella and 38 Enterobacter strains) against cefazolin showed that 63% of the Enterobacter strains were resistant and 50% of the Klebsiella strains were sensitive both in the serial dilution test and in the agar diffusion test. A total of 78% were inhibited by 32 mug cefazolin per millilitre. Isolates from the genitourinary tract were significantly more resistant than those from the respiratory tract.
