Sensitivity of 39 opportunistic Enterobacteria strains was studied with respect to tetracycline, kanamycin, ampicillin, levomycetin, streptomycin and nevigramon. The strains were isolated from children with acute intestinal infections of obscure etiology. 38 isolates were resistant to one or more drugs. The highest number of the strains was resistant to kanamycin, ampicillin and levomycetin, i.e. 81.5, 84.2 and 84.2 per cent of the cultures respectively. Nevigramon proved to be the most effective in vitro (76.4 per cent of the sensitive strains). The ability of the strains to transfer the antibiotic resistance markers on conjugation was tested. Transmission of R plasmids was shown in 75 per cent of the isolates.
