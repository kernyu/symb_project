There is concerned that the new quinolone-resistant strains have increased along with its widespread usage. We analysed the annual changes in frequency of ofloxacin-resistant strains isolated from urine in the past four years at two different types of hospitals, department of urology in Sapporo Medical College and Muroran City Hospital, since the usage of these agents seem to be related to the annual changes of the frequencies. The results were summarised as follows: 1) In the two hospitals, drug volume of the new quinolones had been increased, in particular, the past six years from 1984. 2) The annual changes in frequency of ofloxacin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus have been increasing from 0 to 41.2 percent in Sapporo Medical College and 16.7 to 96.7 percent in Muroran City Hospital. The frequency of ofloxacin-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa also have been increasing from 24 to 66.7 percent in Sapporo Medical College and 37.5 to 81.8 percent in Muroran City Hospital. 3) The frequency of ofloxacin-resistant indole positive Proteus spp. and Serratia marcescens for four years at Sapporo Medical College (indole positive Proteus spp.: 0-1.8 percent, Serratia marcescens: 10-43 percent) was very different from that at Muroran City Hospital (indole positive Proteus spp.: 65-82 percent, Serratia marcescens: 71-100 percent). The difference seems to be caused by the hospital acquired infection.
