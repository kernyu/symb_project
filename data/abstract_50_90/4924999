The activity of a new semisynthetic penicillin, alpha-carboxyl-3-thienylmethyl penicillin (BRL-2288) was determined against 535 clinical isolates of gram-negative bacilli, by using the tube dilution technique. Nearly 80% of isolates of Proteus spp. were inhibited by 3.12 mug or less of this antibiotic per ml. BRL-2288 was as active as ampicillin against Escherichia coli. It was slightly more active than carbenicillin or 6-(d-alpha-sulfoaminophenylacetamido)-penicillanic acid against Pseudomonas sp., with over half of the isolates being inhibited by 50 mug or less of BRL-2288 per ml. Isolates of Klebsiella sp. were routinely resistant to this antibiotic. The drug was bactericidal against most sensitive organisms. BRL-2288 was less active against large inocula. A strain of Pseudomonas sp. which developed resistance to carbenicillin also developed resistance to BRL-2288 simultaneously.
