Two to 6 g of CMX was administered daily to 9 patients who were admitted to ICU, i.e. 5 cases with pneumonia and 4 with sepsis. In all cases, CMX was administered concomitantly with aminoglycoside which had been administered, and additional administration of other antibiotics was avoided. Bacteriologically, P. aeruginosa was isolated from 4 cases, K. pneumoniae from 4 cases, S. marcescens, P. mirabilis and P. cepacia respectively from 1 case. The CMX treatment was considered effective in 4 of 5 pneumonia cases and in 3 of 4 sepsis cases. In total, 7 of 9 cases responded effectively. The clinical effective rate was 77.8%. Elevation of GOT and GPT values was noticed in 1 case, however, the causality with CMX administration was unclear.
