The mitochondrial ATPase from oligomycin-resistant mutants which map on different regions of an extrachromosomal DNA (01 and 011 class mutants) showed an increased resistance to oligomycin and venturicidin when assayed in vitro as compared to the sensitive strains. The resistance to oligomycin of the isolated mitochondrial ATPase from 01 class mutants was higher than that of the 011 class mutants. Cross resistance of the oligomycin-resistant mutants to the antibiotics peliomycin and ossamycin, which also inhibit phosphoryl transfer reactions in mitochondria (Walter et al., 1967), was observed, 01 mutants being more resistant to ossamycin than 011 class mutants. At the concentrations of peliomycin studied, no difference in sensitivity among both groups of oligomycin-resistant mutants could be detected. Mitochondrial respiration and isolated mitochondrial ATPase activity are sensitive to venturicidin, suggesting that the previously observed (Brunner et al., 1977) in vivo venturicidin resistance of K. lactis is probably due to an impairment of the influx of the drug at the level of the plasma membrane.
