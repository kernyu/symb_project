Among 1252 consecutively treated intensive-neonatologic patients during the years 1985 to 1987 79 cases (= 6.5%) of neonatal septicemia were diagnosed by positive blood- and/or cerebrospinal fluid cultures. The relation between early onset type (up to the 4th day of life) and late onset type was 4:1. The most frequent pathogen was Staphylococcus epidermidis (40% of early onset type, 56% of late onset type) followed in the case of early onset type by Listeria monocytogenes (13%), Streptococci (11%), E. coli (11%) and Staphylococcus aureus (10%). Susceptibility to antibiotics is described. Primary therapy of early onset type septicemia must be effective against Listeria monocytogenes and Streptococci. We recommend a combination of a beta-lactam- and an aminoglycosid antibiotic. In case of late onset type we used a cephalosporin in combination with netilmycin. The importance of good hospital hygiene, frequent blood cultures and correct application of aminoglycosid antibiotics is pointed out.
