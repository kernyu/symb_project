Tn1935, a 23.5-kb transposon mediating resistance to ampicillin, kanamycin, mercury, spectinomycin, and sulfonamide was isolated from pZM3, an IncFIme virulence plasmid from Salmonella wien. Tn1935 possesses the entire sequence of Tn21 and contains two additional DNA segments of 0.95 and 2.7 kb carrying the ampicillin and kanamycin resistance genes, respectively. The latter is part of a composite element since it is flanked by two IS15-like insertion sequences (IS1936) in direct orientation. IS1936 is about 800 bp long and is closely related to IS15 delta, IS26, IS46, IS140, and IS176. Functional analysis of IS1936-mediated cointegrates shows that both insertion sequences are active and able to form cointegrates at the same frequency. Resolution of the cointegrates requires the presence of the host Rec system. The presence of the composite IS1936-element within Tn1935 supports the hypothesis that multidrug resistance transposons evolved by insertion of antibiotic determinants which are themselves transposable.
