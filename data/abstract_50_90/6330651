The synergistic effect of cefmenoxime -aminoglycoside combinations against 148 Enterobacteriaceae strains selected for their resistance to beta-lactams was studied. Against the 89 Enterobacteriaceae with cefmenoxime MICs greater than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, the rates of synergy were high : 73 % (netilmicin), 67 % (amikacin), 64 % (gentamicin) and 56 % (tobramycin). In contrast, cefmenoxime-susceptible strains (CMI less than 2 micrograms/ml) had lower rates : 47 % (gentamicin), 44 % (tobramycin), 43 % (netilmicin), and 42 % (amikacin). Synergistic effects on these bacteria are correlated to cefalotin resistance.
