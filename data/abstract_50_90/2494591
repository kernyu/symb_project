Pulmonary and extrapulmonary tuberculosis is still encountered in clinical practice, sometimes in forms that are difficult to categorize nosographically. In this study, the therapeutic efficacy of the 6 main antitubercular drugs (rifampicin, streptomycin, isoniazide, ethambutol, kanamycin, para-aminosalicylic acid) in 20 patients with early TB of the lungs was assessed on the basis of antibiogram findings. Para-aminosalicylic acid was found to be the least effective; isoniazide, rifampicin and streptomycin were reasonably so; both kanamycin and ethambutol were extremely effective.
