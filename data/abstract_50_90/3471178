Intestinal members of the family Enterobacteriaceae were eliminated in five human volunteers treated with oral ofloxacin for 5 days. No emergence of resistant Enterobacteriaceae was observed. Counts of group D streptococci were significantly reduced. Colonization by Candida sp. was observed in all five volunteers during ofloxacin treatment. The anaerobic flora was fairly stable from one sample to another before treatment and was not substantially modified by ofloxacin.
