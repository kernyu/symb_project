The persistence of African swine fever virus (ASFV) on Vero cells was induced by using 5-iodo-2'-deoxyuridine (IDU). After the persistence was established, several cycles of decreasing virus production were observed with intervals in which no virus could be detected. These latency-like periods could last from 15 to 25 days. After three and a half months the cells appeared to be "cured" and no virus was detected during almost three years. These "cured" cells (Vero-L) were more resistant to superinfection with the wild type virus, and when infected they always established persistence without drug addition characterized by a continuous virus production. The persistent virus isolated at passage 23rd from ASFV persistently infected Vero-L cells was different from wild type in a) the morphology of the plaque, b) its ability to replicate in Vero-L cells, and c) greater resistance to be inhibited by IDU in normal Vero cells (Vero-N). These results suggest that both, Vero cells and ASFV have changed during persistent infection.
