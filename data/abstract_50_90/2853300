To localize the insertion sites for Tn7-like transposons Tn1824, Tn1825 and Tn1826 the EcoRI-cleaved fragments of E. coli recA+ and recA- strains chromosome carrying the transposons were hybridized. It was shown that transposition of Tn7-like elements takes place in the strictly defined region of E. coli chromosome, like it had been previously described for transposon Tn7.
