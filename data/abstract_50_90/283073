In a myeloid leukemia cell line, the inducibilities of the Fc receptor, phagocytosis and cell motility were compared. Thymidine analogues such as BUdR, BCdR and IUdR blocked the induction of phagocytosis and motility but not induction of the Fc receptor. This BUdR susceptibility in the induction of phagocytosis and motility was lost in a BUdR resistant line which was isolated for its growth capability in a high concentration of BUdR. Actinomycin D and puromycin brought about a marked decrease in the inducibility of phagocytosis but not in that of the Fc receptor. This led us to the following conclusion: There is a genetic control in the inducibility of phagocytosis and motility in this cell line, and the incorporation of BUdR into cellular DNA results in the DNA becoming unresponsive to a differentiation-stimulating factor. In contrast, gene activation does not seem to be necessary for induction of the Fc receptor. The order of induction of several differentiation markers was also discussed.
