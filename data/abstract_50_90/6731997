From 1977 to 1981, critical tests were conducted on 10 horses naturally infected with population B strongyles. Drugs tested were: oxibendazole (OBZ), 10 mg/kg of body weight (n = 1); albendazole, 10 mg/kg (n = 1); a mixture of thiabendazole (TBZ), 44 mg/kg and trichlorfon, 40 mg/kg (n = 1); a mixture of TBZ at 44 mg/kg with piperazine (PPZ) at 55 mg of base/kg (n = 1); febantel (FBT), 6 mg/kg (n = 3), 12 mg/kg (n = 1), or 24 mg/kg (n = 1); and pyrantel (PRT) pamoate, 6.6 mg of base/kg (n = 1). Large strongyles, Strongylus vulgaris (9 horses) and S edentatus (5 horses), were effectively removed (100%) by each compound and mixture. Five species of small strongyles (Cyathostomum catinatum, Cyathostomum coronatum, Cylicocyclus nassatus, Cylicostephanus goldi, and Cylicostephanus longibursatus), previously singled out in this population as resistant to 5 benzimidazoles (TBZ, mebendazole, cambendazole, fenbendazole, and oxfendazole), but not OBZ, were efficaciously removed by OBZ, albendazole, the mixture of TBZ plus PPZ, FBT (24 mg/kg), or PRT. These 5 small strongyle species were resistant to FBT (6 mg/kg) in 3 foals and Cylicostephanus minutus was also resistant in 2 of 3 foals to FBT (6 mg/kg). Doubling the dose of FBT to 12 mg/kg increased the average removal of the 5 basic species plus Cylicostephanus minutus to 88%. The mixture of TBZ and trichlorfon was relatively ineffective against 3 species (C catinatum, C coronatum, and Cylicostephanus longibursatus), but unexpectedly efficacious (86% to 99%) for 2 species (Cylicocyclus nassatus and Cylicostephanus goldi).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
