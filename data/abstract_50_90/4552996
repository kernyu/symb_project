The role of plasma membrane on the acriflavine sensitivity of Escherichia coli was studied. (14)C-uracil incorporation into ribonucleic acid fraction by spheroplasts was more sensitive to acriflavine in the acriflavine-sensitive strain (genotype acrA) than in the acriflavine-resistant (genotype acrA(+)) strain. There was no difference between two types of cells in the response to osmotic shock, phage sensitivity, and other treatments used to investigate the structure and stability of cell wall. Differences in the electron-microscopic figures between acrA and acrA(+) cells was found in the plasma membrane, surface area just below the membrane, and ribosomal aggregation, when cells were treated with acriflavine. It is concluded that a primary site of acriflavine action is on the plasma membrane, and the acrA mutation is mediated by it. On the basis of the present results, it is evident that differences in the acriflavine binding and the sensitivity to phenethyl alcohol and sodium dodecyl sulfate between the acrA and acrA(+) strains, previously reported, are attributable to a structural difference in the plasma membrane between the two strains.
