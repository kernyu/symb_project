Resistance to azaserine in Escherichia coli is the result of mutations in at least three different loci. All spontaneously arising azaserine-resistant mutants harbor a lesion in the aroP gene. However, a lesion in this gene is not solely responsible for resistance. All spontaneously arising intermediate-level azaserine-resistant mutants also harbor a lesion in a gene designated azaA, which lies near min 43 on the chromosome. High-level resistant mutants harbor lesions in the aroP and azaA genes and in a third gene designated azaB, which lies near min 69 on the chromosome. Transport studies demonstrate that mutants harboring lesions in the azaA gene are not defective in the transport of the aromatic amino acids, but that mutants which harbor lesions in the azaB gene are defective in phenylalanine transport but not in tyrosine or tryptophan transport.
