The cell-mediated immune responses of allograft rejection, delayed hypersensitivity, and resistance to Listeria monocytogenes were suppressed by injections of antithymocyte serum (ATS), but the immune responses were not significantly altered by antimacrophage serum (AMS) or normal rabbit serum (NRS). Antisera were prepared in rabbits against purified mouse thymocytes and purified peritoneal macrophages. When mice were injected with ATS near the time of skin grafting, allografts survived significantly longer. Similar administration of AMS or NRS failed to alter the course of graft rejection. Decreased footpad swelling indicated the suppression of delayed hypersensitivity in mice injected with ATS 6 days after a sublethal inoculation of Listeria cells. None of the serum treatments affected the ultimate survival of mice infected with a small number of bacteria. Either ATS or NRS was injected into immunized mice 1 day before and 2 days after a challenge inoculation of Listeria cells. Pronounced suppression of delayed hypersensitivity was found in the ATS-treated groups, along with extensive mortalities that reached 100% in the group receiving the largest dose of ATS. All control animals survived and demonstrated strong delayed hypersensitivity reactions. Antimacrophage serum had no significant effect on the three mechanisms of cell-mediated immunity that were tested. The lymphoid cells which mediate delayed hypersensitivity, antimicrobial cellular immunity, and allograft rejection possess antigenic determinants in common with thymocytes.
