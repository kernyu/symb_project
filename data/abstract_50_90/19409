The in vitro antimicrobial activity of fortimicin A, the most active member of the fortimicin complex, was compared with that of amikacin, gentamicin, sagamicin and tobramycin against 352 strains of Enterobacteriaceae and other medically significant organisms. Against most of these organisms fortimicin and amikacin had comparable levels of antimicrobial activity, generally slightly less than that of gentamicin, sagamicin or tobramycin. Fortimicin had relatively weak activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains. Fortimicin shows many of the characteristics of other aminoglycoside antibiotics: (i) improved activity at alkaline pH, (ii) rapid, bactericidal action, (iii) reduced activity with increasing inoculum levels, and (iv) synergistic activity with penicillin against enterococci. The activity of fortimicin was compared to that of gentamicin, tobramycin and amikacin against a group of 95 naturally occurring, antibiotic-resistant Gram-negative bacilli other than Pseudomonas. The organisms were isolated from clinical sources and selected primarily for gentamicin resistance by the sensitivity disc test. Fortimicin showed excellent activity against this group of organisms. At a concentration of 6.2 mcg/ml, fortimicin inhibited the most strains (92.6%) followed by amikacin (90.5%), gentamicin (23.2%) and tobramycin (8.4%).
