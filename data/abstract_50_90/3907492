Staphylococcus haemolyticus BM4610 was resistant to high levels of lincomycin and susceptible to macrolides, clindamycin, and streptogramins. This resistance phenotype, not previously reported for a human clinical isolate, was due to inactivation of the antibiotic. The gene conferring resistance to lincomycin in strain BM4610 was carried by a 2.5-kilobase plasmid, pIP855, which was cloned in Escherichia coli. Plasmid pIP855 caused inactivation of both lincomycin and clindamycin in S. haemolyticus and in E. coli but conferred detectable resistance to lincomycin only in S. haemolyticus and to clindamycin only in E. coli.
