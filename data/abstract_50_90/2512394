The in vitro activities of 16 antimicrobial agents against Rickettsia prowazekii (Breinl strain), R. rickettsii (Bitterroot strain), R. sibirica (ATCC No. VR151) and R. tsutsugamushi (Gilliam, Karp, Kato, Shimokoshi, Kawasaki and Kuroki strains) were determined by the cell culture method. Tetracycline, demethylchlortetracycline, doxycycline, minocycline, chloramphenicol, kitasamycin and rifampicin were generally effective (MIC, 0.005-0.78 micrograms/ml) to all strains tested. Quinolones such as norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin were moderately active, but they were less active against R. tsutsugamushi than other rickettsial species. Penicillins and cephems showed low activity against most of the strains tested, but high concentrations of benzylpenicillin (MIC, 25-50 micrograms/ml) inhibited R. prowazekii, R. rickettsii and R. sibirica. These findings may be applicable for differentiation of species of genus Rickettsia.
