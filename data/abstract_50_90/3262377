The mutagenic action of near ultraviolet (NUV, greater than or equal to 280) nm) on purple phototrophic soil bacteria Rhodobacter sphaeroides: wild strain 2R and 12 mutants obtained earlier sensitive to UV derivates (UVS) was investigated. The mutagenic action of NUV was measured by induction of resistance to tetracycline (Tet) and nalidixic acid (Nal) and reversion of pigment mutants to wild-type phenotype. The NUV light induces the mutations of resistance to Nal and Tet in wild-type strain 2R; the UVS mutants differed greatly in their NUV-induced mutability. Three UVS mutants were characterized by greatly increased mutability in all analysed loci; slight mutability was found in seven mutants. On the basis of the data obtained it has been concluded that the UVS mutants R. sphaeroides can be used as test organisms in estimation of mutagenic activity of NUV. The molecular mechanisms and genetic control of NUV-induced mutagenesis are discussed.
