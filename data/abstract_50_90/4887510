A number of mutations (45) expressed as cold-sensitive conditional lethal pheno-types were screened by transduction for their linkage to the streptomycin-resistance locus; 7 showed such linkage. Of these, two were studied in greater detail. The sedimentation profiles of ribosomes from cultures grown at low temperature differed from wild type and from one another. Both mutants lost ribonucleic acid control at low temperature. It is suggested that a high proportion of mutants expressing a cold-sensitive phenotype harbor mutations in genes affecting ribosome synthesis or regulation.
