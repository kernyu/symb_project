Amphotericin B (AmB) treatment before infection with the bacterium Listeria monocytogenes prolonged survival of AKR mice but shortened survival of C57BL/6 mice compared with survival of untreated infected controls. C57BL/6 mice were also more sensitive to the acute toxic effects of AmB than AKR mice, as were (C57BL/6 X AKR)F1 hybrid mice. Spleen cells and erythrocytes (RBCs) from the C57BL/6 and the F1 hybrid mice were both more sensitive to the lytic and lethal effects of AmB than corresponding cells from AKR mice. Biochemical analysis indicated that catalase levels in RBCs from C57BL/6 and F1 hybrid mice were about 60% of those found in RBCs from AKR mice. The lysis by AmB of RBCs from all these strains of mice was inhibited by catalase or incubation in a low-oxygen environment. These findings suggest that (i) the low catalase levels in C57BL/6 and F1 hybrid mice may limit the protection of cells from the oxidant damage involved in AmB action, and (ii) the toxicity which occurs at low concentrations of AmB in the mouse strains with low intracellular catalase levels may interfere with or ablate the AmB-induced increases in mouse resistance to L. monocytogenes infection.
