When arabinose-grown Escherichia coli B/r is ultraviolet (UV) irradiated in the logarithmic phase of growth, the dose inactivation curve for both colony formation and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) synthesis (based on the relative rates of synthesis) is exponential in nature. When protein synthesis is inhibited before UV-irradiation, both inactivation curves have a large shoulder. Pre-irradiation inhibition of protein synthesis increases considerably the colony-forming ability of a UV-irradiated Hcr(-) and Rec(-) strain of E. coli B/r. However, with the repair-deficient strains, both the shoulder and slope of the survival curve are affected. We investigated the effect of UV irradiation on DNA synthesis in Hcr(-) bacteria and found that pre-irradiation inhibition of protein synthesis increases UV resistance of DNA replication in this strain also. The results suggest that inhibition of protein synthesis before irradiation increases UV resistance in E. coli B/r by a mechanism which is independent of both the excision and recombination repair systems.
