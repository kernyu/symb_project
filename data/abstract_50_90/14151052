Bare, L. N. (University of Kentucky, Lexington), R. F. Wiseman, and O. J. Abbott. Effect of dietary antibiotics upon coliform bacteria and lactobacilli in the intestinal tract of uric acid-fed chicks. J. Bacteriol. 87:329-331. 1964.-Male chicks (1-day-old; Vantress X Arbor Acre) were fed a basal glucose-soybean oil meal diet, a 2% uric acid-containing diet with and without 5 mg/lb of zinc bacitracin and 20 mg/lb of procaine penicillin G, and one supplemented with the antibiotics only. After 4 weeks, the chicks receiving the uric acid without antibiotics showed a weight depression. The presence of antibiotics in the ration with the uric acid reversed this growth depression. Bacteriological and chemical analyses of the contents of the small intestine revealed an increase in numbers of uricolytic Aerobacter spp. and an increased degradation of uric acid in the tract of the "uric-antibiotic"-fed chicks. The counts of lactobacilli were always lowest in this group of chicks
