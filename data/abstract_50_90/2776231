Three independent pleiotropic drug-resistance (pdr) mutants were isolated by selecting for resistance to the anti-microtubule herbicides amiprophos-methyl (APM) and oryzalin (ORY). These three mutants and a previously isolated mutant, ani1 (anisomycin resistance), were semi-dominant in heterozygous diploids, and they displayed varying degrees of resistance to structurally and functionally unrelated inhibitors such as cycloheximide, cryptopleurine, emetine, atrazine, and nonidet P-40. Linkage analysis and genetic mapping suggested that three of the four mutants, including ani1, define a single locus, here named pdr1. The fourth mutant defined a new locus, pdr2, which is located on the left arm of linkage group VI. One pdr1 mutant exhibited unusual genetic interactions, including enhanced ts-lethality and synergistic increases in drug resistance, when combined with pdr2-1 and with herbicide-resistant alleles of three other genes.
