Two methods for the direct isolation of spontaneous ssd mutants of Escherichia coli K-12 strains are described; (i) by growth with L-serine as the carbon source, and (ii) by low-level kanamycin resistance. A newly isolated mutant had the same phenotype as the mutant described previously, including inefficient use of the glucose, inability to growth with succinate, altered transport characteristics, and altered resistance to certain growth effectors. Succinate-utilizing derivatives which appear to be intragenic are characterized in detail. The relation between the mutants isolated here and mutants which are thought to have impairment in a system of coupling respiratory energy to active transport (ecfB mutants) is discussed.
