The activity of cefamandole and cefuroxime against oxacillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis was studied in vitro to determine whether there was any relationship between oxacillin resistance phenotypes and cephalosporin activity. Oxacillin resistance phenotypes were determined by efficiency-of-plating studies on Mueller-Hinton agar containing oxacillin, with and without NaCl, and incubated at 30 and 35 degrees C. On the basis of MIC and MBC determinations, cefamandole was more active than cefuroxime against oxacillin-resistant S. epidermidis. Although temperature had minimal effect on the activity of either cefamandole or cefuroxime, NaCl significantly decreased the activity of cefuroxime but not of cefamandole. Neither cephalosporin consistently produced greater than or equal to 99.9% bactericidal activity within 24 h in timed killing-curve studies. No consistent relationship was observed between cefamandole or cefuroxime activity and oxacillin resistance phenotype.
