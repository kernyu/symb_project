The DNA replication inhibitor microcin B17 is a peptide antibiotic produced by Escherichia coli strains carrying plasmid pMccB17. Here we present evidence that antibiotic activities previously named colicin X are probably identical to microcin B17. Our results include comparison of the conditions of production of the antibiotics, their mode of action, cross-immunity of producer strains, and cross-resistance of resistant mutants. Plasmids encoding colicin X have been identified and shown to have a region of significant homology with the microcin B17-producing region of pMccB17 DNA.
