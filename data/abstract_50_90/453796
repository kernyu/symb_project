The structure of transmissive resistance to antibiotics was studied in 1260 Salmonella strains of 57 serotypes and R-plasmid resistance was found in the representatives of 13 (31.6 per cent) serotypes. The transmissive resistance correlated with multiple resistance to 4--10 antibiotics. The rate of occurrence of the transmissive R-plasmids was markedly higher in the bipathogenic serotypes. The structure of the R-plasmid resistance was most pronounced and diverse in S. typhimurium. It was usually revealed simultaneously with registration of the hospital infection. The plasmid with the determinants of resistance to erythromycin and benzylpenicillin was found only in this serotype. The nature of resistance and spectrum of transmissive resistance to antibiotics in Salmonella may serve as an additional epidemiological feature of the strains.
