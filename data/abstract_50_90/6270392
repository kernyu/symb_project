A new antibiotic drug of cephalosporin with marked resistance to beta-lactamase, cefotaxime (HR 756) for parenteral use in 8 patients with acute or subacute cholecystitis with cholelithiasis. Cefotaxime was administrated by intravenous injection or drip infusion at a daily dose of 1-4 g. Clinical response was excellent in 1 case, good in 7 cases, and fair or poor was none. Clinical adverse effect was not recognized. Cefotaxime in a dose of 1 g was given intravenously during operation to those same 8 patients. Tissue specimens of different places were taken from removed organs. The materials of A-bile and B-bile were subsequently taken at intervals. Determination of cefotaxime concentration was performed according to the bioassay method with Micrococcus luteus ATCC 9341 strain. Cefotaxime concentrations in the A-bile increased gradually until 1 hour after the intravenous administration. Cefotaxime was observed in the B-bile through the gallbladder wall after the intravenous injection.
