Expression of the beta-tubulin-encoding gene (TUB2) of Candida albicans has been examined in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Overexpression of the TUB2 gene of C. albicans, as well as that of S. cerevisiae, was found to be lethal. Chromosomal integration of the C. albicans TUB2 gene into a strain in which the native TUB2 gene had been deleted led to functional complementation. The results demonstrate that correct splicing of the two introns present in the C. albicans TUB2 gene occurs in the heterologous host strain containing this gene. Such strains are supersensitive to the tubulin-binding agent benomyl, indicating that the natural resistance of C. albicans to benomyl is not related to the structure of its beta-tubulin.
