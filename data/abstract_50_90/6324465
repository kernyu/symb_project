In this investigation the sensitivity of vaccinia virus to interferon (IFN) has been examined in cultured cells. In a variety of mouse and human cells of different origins vaccinia virus functions (RNA, protein, and virus yields) were found to be relatively resistant to IFN. In these systems, the levels of the IFN-mediated enzyme activities (2-5A synthetase and protein kinase) were severely impaired by the virus. This virus-mediated inhibitory effect developed with time after infection and was dependent on viral protein synthesis. Mixed infections between vaccinia virus and viruses (VSV or polio) which are sensitive to IFN showed that both protein synthesis and virus yields were not inhibited. These findings show that vaccinia virus can overcome the antiviral action of IFN and that viral gene functions appear to be involved in this interference phenomenon.
