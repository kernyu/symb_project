Epsilon-aminocaproic acid, an original antifibrinolytic had a rapid and prolonged protective effect, thus lowering the death rate of experimental mice contaminated with virulent strains of the influenza virus. The protective effect of the acid was observed after its intraperitoneal administration in a dose of 20 mg/mouse 24 hours before contamination by the strain with the H3N2 antigenic formula and after intranasal application of 15 mg of epsilon-aminocaproic acid divided into 2 doses 2 days before contamination by the strain with the H1N1 antigenic formula. In the animals contaminated by the H1N1 influenza virus 5 days after subcutaneous administration of the drug in a dose of 30 mg there was detected in the lungs a much lower number of the infectious viruses 3 days after the contamination. It was shown that 3 and 6 weeks after initiation of the 5-day treatment course with subcutaneous administration of epsilon-aminocaproic acid in a daily dose of 90 mg/mouse the animal resistance to the H1N1 influenza virus increased. No interferonogenic activity after administration of epsilon-aminocaproic acid was observed in the mice.
