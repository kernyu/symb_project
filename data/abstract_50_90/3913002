Biochemical aspects of action of antifolates and 4-aminoquinolines and their resistance in the malaria parasites are reviewed, with emphasis on pyrimethamine and chloroquine respectively. Resistance to pyrimethamine has been shown to be associated with either an increase in the amount of parasite dihydrofolate reductase or a reduced affinity of the enzyme for drug binding, in line with the presence of a distinctive pathway for folate metabolism. The theories for drug synergism in the folate pathway are discussed with respect to resistance to pyrimethamine and its combination with sulpha drugs. The biochemical basis for chloroquine resistance is still unclear, reflecting incomplete understanding of its mechanism of action. Data implicating the role of haemozoin and other components as a putative chloroquine receptor of the parasites are reviewed, and possible explanations for resistance are discussed.
