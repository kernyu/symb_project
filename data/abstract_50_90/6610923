The mutual interaction on the antibacterial activity of metronidazole and tinidazole with ampicillin, doxycycline and co-trimoxazole was studied by two-fold agar dilution series and chess-board determinations with 24 anaerobic bacterial strains which were recent clinical isolates. The nitroimidazoles had similar activity, and partial or complete synergy was observed in 83 - 88% of the strains when they were combined with ampicillin and doxycycline and 83 - 100% when combined with co-trimoxazole, which was moderately less active on a weight basis. A combination between ampicillin and a nitroimidazole would be preferable due to high level of synergy, high activity against anaerobes, and a more consistent supplementary activity against enterococci.
