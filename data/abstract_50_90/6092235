A series of cloning vectors has been constructed based on the broad-host-range plasmid R300B. One of these vectors, pGSS33, has a size of 13.4 kb and carries four antibiotic resistance genes [ampicillin (Apr), chloramphenicol (Cmr), streptomycin (Smr) and tetracycline (Tcr)], all of which have restriction sites for insertional inactivation. The derivation, structure and uses of the plasmids are described.
