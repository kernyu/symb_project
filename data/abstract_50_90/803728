Urogenital tuberculosis has not decreased in incidence like other forms of tuberculosis and this is not to be expected in the coming years. Following combined modern chemotherapy the chances of conversion and also clinical cure are increased. The patient's cooperation during a systematic triple drug therapy in adequate dosage is important. The possibility of ambulatory treatment will depend on the clinical findings and the patient's social situation. Physical and occupational therapy and early resocialization of the patient are important. Prolonged unemployment should be avoided. Urological care of the patient is particularly important in the early phases of the treatment.
