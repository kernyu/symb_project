Two outer-membrane (OM) proteins of Yersinia enterocolitica YOMP-C and YOMP-F appear to function as porins. Mutants that were YOMP-C- and YOMP-F- exhibited changes in cephaloridine and [3H]glucose uptake and increased resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics (especially cephalosporins) and tetracycline. Alterations in OM permeability may contribute to antibiotic resistance in Yersinia.
