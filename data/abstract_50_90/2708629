The effect of selection pressure on the cholinesterase (AChE) activity of two strains of Boophilus microplus (Canestrini) resistant to coumaphos was monitored. Total AChE and protein was determined from three generations of resistant ticks and a susceptible strain. The effect of an AChE inhibitor, coroxon (the oxygen analog of coumaphos), was also determined. The resistance of the susceptible strain (Escondido) to coumaphos remained relatively unchanged throughout the study. The Tuxpan strain lost some of its resistance to coumaphos as the generations proceeded (AChE increased instead of decreased). The Tuxtla strain became more resistant to coumaphos as the generations proceeded (AChE increased).
