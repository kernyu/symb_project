Rrine collections were made by ten volunteers taking cotrimoxazole and a sulphamoxole/trimethoprim combination on a cross-over basis. The latter was given in approximately half the dose of cotrimoxazole. Following collection of urine and its sterile filtration, the trimethoprim and sulphonamide concentrations were estimated. The urines were then inoculated with various species of Enterobacteriaceae whose minimum inhibitory concentrations had been previously determined. The viable counts in these urines were followed for 24 hours and from these the times to kill 90% of bacteria were calculated. These were very reproducible for any one experiment but showed no correlation with drug concentration, source of the urine or organism sensitivity, except for one organism which had high resistance to both sulphonamide and trimethoprim. When the organism was sensitive to at least trimethoprim a slow bactericidal effect was generally seen with either combination. We concluded that in this type of experiment the higher dosed combination showed no advantage contrary to a previous report, but in agreement with another. This brings into question the current dosage regime of cotrimoxazole when used to treat urinary tract infections in that its higher dosage over certain other sulphonamide/trimethoprim combinations appears to confer no advantage in our experiments.
