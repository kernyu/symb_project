Ribonucleic acid polymerase activity in partially purified extract of cells of Bacillus subtilis harvested at different times (t-1, to, t1, and t2) was studied by zone centrifugation. During the course of sporulation, vegetative sigma-factor activity decreased and the transcription complex lost some of its affinity for active sigma factor. The complex underwent a two-stage change in sedimentation value, from 14.5S in vegetative growth phase to a 13S species very early in sporulation to a 16S species at later times. Two SpoO mutants have been studied by zone centrifugation. One strain, a rifampin-resistant (RfmR) mutant, failed to show any modification of the transcription complex, whereas the other, a Rfms strain, underwent a partial evolution of the transcription complex after to.
