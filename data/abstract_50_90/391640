Genetic analysis of 131 independent transpositions of the tetracycline-resistance element Tn10 from a single site in phage P22 into the histidine operon of Salmonella typhimurium reveals that Tn10 insertions are not randomly distributed along this chromosomal target. The insertions occur in 22 different "clusters"; insertions within each cluster are very tightly linked in recombination tests. Tn10 insertions are not evenly distributed among the identified clusters. The existence of these clusters suggests that this chromosomal target contains particular genetic signals that guide Tn10 to particular preferred positions for insertion. Insertions within each cluster occur in both orientations with roughly equal frequency.--The relationship among different insertions within each cluster has been examined. The resolution of genetic mapping places an upper limit of about 50 basepairs on the distance between different insertions within a cluster. Different insertions within a cluster usually have the same reversion frequency; however, heterogeneity in reversion frequency has been detected in at least two clusters. For most clusters, the available data are consistent with the simple possibility that all insertions within a cluster are at identical positions; however, the data do not exclude other possibilities.
