An experimental evaluation of the impact of a number of chemical compounds toxicologically attributed to different hazardous classes on animal resistibility to influenza virus showed that resistibility dependence on the dose and effect duration had a nonlinear character. There was no complete correlation of a hazardous class of chemical substances and their impact on body resistibility to respiratory infections.
