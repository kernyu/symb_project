The number of cells of a mutant of Rhizobium meliloti resistant to streptomycin decreased to 10(6) per 1 g of soil during 3-5 days and remained at this level for at least a month when 10(8) cells of the mutant per 1 g were introduced into non-sterile soil. Factors causing such a stability of the population are discussed.
