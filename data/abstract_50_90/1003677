Though pyrrolnitrin is surpassed by clotrimazole in in vitro antitrichophyton activity against Trichophyton sp., the therapeutic effect of pyrrolnitrin against experimental trichophytosis in guinea pigs was more potent than that of clotrimazole. The detection of antifungal activity from topically treated guinea pigs suggests that pyrrolnitrin obtains higher concentrations than clotrimazole in dermal tissue.
