The kinetics of the antiviral effect of intramuscular and intravenous injections of recombinant human interferon alpha 2a were investigated in healthy volunteers. Cohorts of eight to 11 subjects received single intramuscular injections of either 0.3 X 10(6), 3 X 10(6), or 18 X 10(6) U or an intravenous infusion of 18 X 10(6) U over 30 minutes. Serial samples of peripheral blood mononuclear cells were analyzed for antiviral effects including both (2'-5') oligoadenylate synthetase activity and resistance to vesicular stomatitis virus infection in vitro. A dose-response relationship was established between recombinant human interferon alpha 2a dose and both vesicular stomatitis virus resistance and (2'-5') oligoadenylate synthetase activity. At the 0.3 X 10(6) U dose an antiviral effect occurred without clinical side effects. The presence of clinical side effects is not necessary for an antiviral effect.
