We have examined the restriction endonuclease cleavage patterns exhibited by the mitochondrial DNAs (mtDNA) of four chloramphenicol-resistant (CAPR) human x mouse hybrids and one CAPR cybrid derived from CAPR HeLa cells and CAPS mouse RAG cells. Restriction fragments of mtDNAs were separated by electrophoresis and transferred by the Southern technique to diazobenzyloxymethyl paper. The covalently bound DNA fragments were hybridized initially with 32P-labeled complementary RNA (cRNA) prepared from human mtDNA and, after removal of the human probe, hybridized with mouse [32P]cRNA prepared from mouse mtDNA. Three hybrids which preferentially segregated human chromosomes and the cybrid exhibited mtDNA fragments indistinguishable from mouse cells. One hybrid, ROH8A, which exhibited "reverse" chromosome segregation, contained only human mtDNA. The pattern of chromosome and mtDNA segregation observed in these hybrids and the cybrid support the hypothesis that a complete set of human chromosomes must be retained if a human-mouse hybrid is to retain human mitochondrial DNA.
