Dissociation is a phenomenon when from an initial bacterial population different forms in morphological, physiological aspects have been produced. For bacterial producers of biologically active substances the investigation of this process is important for industrial microbiology. Bacillus subtilis 76 is a producer of proteolytic enzyme complex with milk-coagulating effect. It dissociates in several different forms. Some of them (M, R, S) have been studied. They are plasmidless, prototrophs and tiostrepton-resistant. The results obtained are of a great importance for the future genetic experiments.
