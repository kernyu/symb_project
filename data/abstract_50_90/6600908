Pseudomonas paucimobilis (group IIK, biotype 1) clinical isolates showed in vitro resistance to ampicillin, carbenicillin, cephalothin, cefoxitin, cefamandole, moxalactam, cefotaxime, cefoperazone, mezlocillin, azlocillin, piperacillin, and ticarcillin. Those agents to which the microbes were shown to be susceptible were tetracycline, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, tobramycin, kanamycin, amikacin, netilmicin, sisomicin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, and ceftizoxime.
