Experience in treating 81 patients with severe bronchial infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa is described. For those who were desperately ill high doses of intravenous carbenicillin (18g. or more daily) were successful, even when initial carbenicillin resistance was present. For those who were less desperately ill lower doses of carbenicillin together with high doses of gentamicin (given both intramuscularly and by aerosol) comprised the treatment of choice. Gentamicin alone or colistin gave little or no benefit and cannot be recommended.
