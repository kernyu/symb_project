The thiostrepton-resistance-conferring plasmid pIJ702 was integrated into the ermE region of the chromosome of erythromycin (Er)-producing bacterium Saccharopolyspora erythraea (Streptomyces erythraeus) by single, reciprocal (Campbell) recombination between DNA cloned in the vector and homologous nucleotide sequences in the chromosome. Genetic mapping experiments by conjugational transfer were used to establish that the ErR gene, ermE, was located close to the Er-production loci eryA34 and eryB25.
