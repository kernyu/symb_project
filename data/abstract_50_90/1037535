Both agar diluiton and agar diffusion tests with 8 clinically useful or potentially useful antimicrobial agents were performed with 74 strains of Bacteroides fragilis. Correlation of results obtained by the two methods and applicability of the single disc test to the measurement of antimicrobial susceptibility of anaerobes were analyzed. Prediction of susceptibility, intermediate susceptibility, and resistance of anaerobic bacteria to antimicrobial agents, based on the measurement of inhibition zone diameter, appeared to be satisfactory generally.
