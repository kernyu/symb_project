Lysozyme content was determined in the subcutaneous cellular tissue of guinea pigs and albino rats differing by species resistance to brucella infection. Experiments were conducted on intact animals and those inoculated subcutaneously with live Br. abortus 19-BA vaccine. Connective tissue was taken from the site of the vaccine administration and from the contralateral side (control). Observations showed connective tissue of the animals highly sensitive to brucella infection to be exceedingly poor in this enzyme; as to connective tissue of albino rats with low sensitivity--it contained high amount of this enzyme. Lysozyme content increased considerably in the animals belonging to both species in the inflammatory focus developing at the site of the vaccine inoculation.
