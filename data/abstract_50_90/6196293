Mice inoculated intraperitoneally with herpes simplex virus type 2 develop focal necrotizing hepatitis and eventually die from ascending myelitis and encephalitis. The genetics of resistance to the infection were analyzed in crosses between resistant C57BL/10 mice and susceptible BALB/c mice. It was shown that the resistance of C57BL/10 mice to hepatitis induction was influenced by an X-linked dominant gene as previously shown for the GR mouse strain. The course of infection in the liver pointed to early, natural defense mechanisms as being responsible for the difference between the mouse strains, whereas the clearance of virus from the liver, probably mediated by specific immunity, was exerted at the same time and with equal efficiency for all groups of mice. In mortality experiments, resistance was shown to be an autointerference phenomenon in that a considerable number of C57BL/10 mice survived an intraperitoneal injection of 10(6) PFU, whereas all mice were killed by 10(5) PFU. This resistance of C57BL/10 mice to high doses of HSV-2 was retrieved in all groups of F1 mice in crosses between C57BL/10 and BALB/c mice except the (BALB/c female X C57 male) male group, in which the mice receive the X chromosome from the susceptible BALB/c female. Thus, the autointerference phenomenon also seems to be influenced by loci on the X chromosome. A similar pattern of inheritance was observed when early interferon induction (4 to 5 h after infection) in response to HSV-2 was measured. The possible relevance of this early interferon response in conjunction with other potential natural defense mechanisms is discussed.
