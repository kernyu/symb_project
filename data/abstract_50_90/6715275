The effect of feeding subtherapeutic (27.5 micrograms/g of diet for 85 d) and therapeutic (220 micrograms/g of diet for 14 d, followed by an antibiotic-free diet for 71 d) levels of chlortetracycline (CTC) on the antibiotic resistance of fecal coliforms of pigs from two herds (36 pigs/herd) with different histories of antibiotic exposure when housed in a newly constructed confinement facility was determined. The CTC-resistant coliforms were higher (65 vs 51%) for antibiotic (AB) pigs than for nonantibiotic (NAB) pigs after they had been fed an antibiotic-free diet for 21 d. Percentages of isolates resistant to ampicillin, kanamycin, neomycin and tetracycline and multiple antibiotic resistance were greater (P less than .05) in AB pigs after 21 d. Feeding subtherapeutic CTC resulted in a linear increase in CTC-resistant coliforms with time on experiment (P less than .03, NAB; P less than .06, AB). The CTC-resistant coliforms increased during the 14 d that therapeutic CTC was fed, then they decreased during the 71 d that the antibiotic-free diet was fed, resulting in a quadratic response with time (P less than .03, AB). Feeding subtherapeutic CTC resulted in a greater increase in CTC-resistant coliforms in AB (47%) than in NAB (23%) pigs. The CTC-resistant coliforms decreased after the therapeutic group had been returned to the antibiotic-free diet (P less than .05, NAB). Feeding CTC caused greater changes in the precentages of isolates from NAB pigs that were resistant to selected antibiotics and in multiple antibiotic resistance than in isolates from AB pigs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
