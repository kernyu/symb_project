Antibodies against heart vascular structures and striated muscle cells interstitium (EVI antibodies) persist in Chagas' disease patients who had been cured by specific treatment as demonstrated by negative xenodiagnosis, conventional serology (CS) and complement mediated lysis (CoML). On the other hand, EVI antibodies are either present or absent in treated patients presenting positive CS but negative CoML. Since CoML detects antibodies associated to resistance, EVI antibodies are not likely to participate in the control of T. cruzi infections although they might be induced by cross-reacting antigens of heart cells and the parasite. They are neither necessarily related to antibodies responsible for CS. Absorption with T. cruzi and heart tissue confirms the suggestion that EVI antibodies are induced by a number of antigenic determinants, most from heart structures with a minor participation of T. cruzi antigens.
