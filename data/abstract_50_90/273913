Interferon treatment of AKR,C- cells was followed by the establishment of an antiviral state and apparently concomitant morphological, physical, and biochemical alterations of the cell plasma membrane. The density of the plasma membrane was significant altered, and the concentration of some plasma membrane glycoproteins and the number of intramembranous particles observed in freeze-fracture electron micrographs were increased. A parallel increase in the concentration of intramembranous particles and the resistance to viral infection during interferon treatment as well as their parallel decrease upon removal of interferon suggests a relationship between the particle density and the establishment of the antiviral state.
