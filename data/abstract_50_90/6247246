Derivatives of plasmid pBR322 that are suitable for high-level expression of foreign genes have been constructed. The vectors contain the Escherichia coli tryptophan promoter, the trpE gene, and about 15% of the trpD gene. To obtain expression, foreign genes are fused to the trpD gene fragment. After induction of the trp operon with 3 beta-indolylacrylic acid, trp gene products increase at least 50-fold, to account for 55% of the newly synthesised protein and 30% of total protein in the cell.
