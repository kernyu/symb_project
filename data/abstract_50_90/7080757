The comparative study of 830 hospital and 181 extrahospital S. aureus strains has revealed the existance of the interpopulation (group, geographic) variability of this species. Hospital strains differ from those inhabiting other places by the composition of phago- and resistovars, greater resistance to antibiotics, antiseptic and disinfecting agents, the inhibiting action of antagonist, as well as by pronounced antagonistic activity. The biological characteristics of such strains allow one to classify them with the hospital ecological variants (ecovars) of S. aureus. These properties of hospital strains give them selective advantages in hospitals over extrahospital strains, and the latter are thus ousted from the skin surface, mucous membranes, wound surfaces. The measures taken to prevent hospital infections must be aimed mainly against the hospital ecovars of these bacteria.
