The in vitro activity of temocillin, cefotaxime, aztreonam and ceftazidime was tested against selected cefotaxime-resistant isolates (43 Enterobacter species, 37 Serratia marcescens, 16 Morganella morganii, 8 Klebsiella species) and cefotaxime-susceptible strains of the same species. Cross-resistance with a high degree of correlation was observed between cefotaxime and aztreonam or ceftazidime, but not between cefotaxime and temocillin.
