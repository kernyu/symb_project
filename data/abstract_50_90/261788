Bacteriodes meningitis without associated cerebral abscess occurred in an elderly man who had a long history of chronic otitis media. Anaerobic cultures of the cerebrospinal fluid revealed bacteroides organisms. Sensitivity testing showed them to be resistant to penicillin and chloramphenicol but sensitive to metronidazole. Appropriate therapy with this agent eradicated the causative organisms and produced rapid clinical improvement.
