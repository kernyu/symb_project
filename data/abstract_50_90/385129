The high sensitivity of rough mutants of Salmonella typhimurium, S. minnesota, and Escherichia coli 08 (i.e. with defects in the carbohydrate core of the lipopolysaccharide) to several antibiotics and to the dye gentian violet could be substantially reduced by the addition of cations (Mg2+, Na+) into the growth medium. One heptoseless mutant of S. typhimurium (chemotype Re) and its isogenic smooth parent strain were studied in more detail. The uptake of gentian violet was about 20% in the smooth strain, about 60% in the Re strain grown without additional cations, but decreased to about 15% in the same strain, when cations had been present during growth. In all cases, almost 50% of the gentian violet taken up by the cells was membrane-bound. The total membranes of the Re strain grown in nutrient broth without additional Mg2+ ions were reduced in the 36K and 34K major outer membrane proteins compared with the smooth strain; when grown with added cations the Re total membranes (and even whole cells) did not revert to the protein pattern of the smooth strain.
