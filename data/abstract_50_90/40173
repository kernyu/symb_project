Ninety-seven isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae referred to the National Health Institute between January 1976 and March 1978 were tested for their susceptibility to 10 antimicrobials. All were susceptible to penicillin, erythromycin, chloramphenicol, vancomycin, clindamycin, cephalothin and rifampicin. Resistance to tetracycline was found in 9.3 percent of the isolates, and 9.7 percent were resistant to a combination of sulphamethoxazole and trimethoprim.
