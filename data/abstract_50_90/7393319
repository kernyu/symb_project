Mycoplasmal infections still cause severe problems in cell cultures, particularly permanent lines, and although rapid detection is possible the only methods proposed for the elimination of the mycoplasma are either laborious or unsatisfactory. Treatment with antibiotics often leads to the development of resistance and we have found it more successful to passage contaminated cells in nude (thymusless) mice although the cells cannot always be recovered. But when the resulting subcutanous tumours can be collected, the cells are both free of mycoplasma and accompanied by a large number of macrophages. Because nude mice have no T cell-dependent immune response, it seemed possible that the macrophages could be responsible for the elimination of the mycoplasma. The experiments reported here support this hypothesis, and have led to a rapid and reproducible technique for eliminating mycoplasma in vitro by a brief co-cultivation of contaminated cells with mouse macrophages, in the presence of antibiotics.
