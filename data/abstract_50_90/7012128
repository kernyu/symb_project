The genetic and molecular properties of the plasmids in Salmonella typhimurium phase type 201 isolated are described. Such strains are resistant to streptomycin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, ampicillin, kanamycin, and several other antimicrobial drugs, and are highly pathogenic for calves. These strains have been encountered with increasing frequency since 1972 in West Germany and The Netherlands. We show that isolates of this phage type constitute a very homogeneous group with regard to their extrachromosomal elements. These bacteria carry three small plasmids: pRQ3, a 4.2-megadalton (Md) colicinogenic plasmid; pRQ4, 3.4-Md plasmid that interferes with the propagation of phages; and pRQ5, a 3.2-Md cryptic plasmid. Tetracycline resistance resides on a conjugative 120-MD plasmid pRQ1, belonging to the incompatibility class H2. Other antibiotic resistance determinants are encoded by a nonconjugative 108-Md plasmid pRQ2. Transfer of multiple-antibiotic resistance to appropriate recipient strains was associated with the appearance of a 230-Md plasmid, pRQ6. It appears that pRQ6 is a stable cointegrate of pRQ1 and pRQ2. This cointegrate plasmid was transferable with the same efficiency as pRQ1. Other conjugative plasmids could mobilize pRQ2, but stable cointegrates were not detected in the transconjugants. Phase type 201 strains carry a prophage, and we show that phage pattern 201 reflects the interference with propagation of typing phages effected by this prophage and plasmid pRQ4 in strains of phage type 201.
