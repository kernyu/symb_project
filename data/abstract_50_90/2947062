Antibiotics active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa are carboxy- and ureidopenicillins, some cephalosporins, aztreonam, imipenem, aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones and, in some special circumstances, polymyxins and fosfomycin. The choice of the antibiotic should be based not only on minimal inhibitory concentrations in vitro, but also on the inoculum effect, on the speed with which bacteria are killed, on natural or acquired resistance and on data obtained from experimental infections in animals. Antibiotics used against P. aeruginosa infections must be rapidly bactericidal. Since the prognosis is severe, the initial treatment given before the sensitivity of the strain is known must combine a beta-lactam antibiotic and an aminoglycoside, both being selected among the most regularly active.
