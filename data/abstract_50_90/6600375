Transport and electrical characteristics of the isolated skin of larval Rana catesbeiana were analyzed using ion substitution and nystatin. When the inner (IBS) and outer (OBS) bathing solutions contained Na Ringer solution the electrical potential (TEP), short-circuit current (SCC), and resistance (R2) were 23.5 +/- 7.0 mV, 2.8 +/- 0.7 microA . cm-2, and 8.00 +/- 0.74 k omega. cm2, respectively (n = 4). When K was substituted for Na in the OBS these values were not changed significantly. When nystatin (120 U.cm-3), a drug that increases the permeability of membranes to small cations, was added to the OBS (Na Ringer) there was a striking increase in the TEP to 52.8 +/- 3.1 mV, SCC to 14.8 +/- 2.0 microA . cm-2, and drop in R2 to 3.75 +/- 0.52 k omega . cm2. The response to nystatin was similar with Na or K Ringer solution in the OBS (Na Ringer in the IBS). With Na Ringer in the OBS and IBS, the increase in SCC induced by low doses of nystatin equaled net Na flux measured isotopically. Plots of transepithelial conductance against SCC after nystatin were linear and provided estimates of shunt resistance (R*sh = 14.6 +/- 1.3 k omega . cm2) and electromotive driving force for ions (E*A = 76 +/- 3 mV). Similar curves were obtained with K Ringer in the OBS. In the presence of nystatin, characteristics of the basolateral membrane were evaluated. It displayed selective permeability to K relative to Na or Tris.
