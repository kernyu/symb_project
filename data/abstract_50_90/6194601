The paper deals with the effect of thyroxine and insulin on the oligomycin-sensitive ATPase activity, the content of DNA and RNA in the liver mitochondria of uneven-aged rats as well as with the effect of actinomycin D and selective inhibitors of cytoplasmic and mitochondrial translation on the ATPase induction. The both hormones rise the mitochondria ATPase activity (whose increase is blocked by actinomycin D) and also the content of RNA in all mitochondrial fractions of young animals. In old animals insulin induces ATPase without changing the RNA level and thyroxine increases ATPase and RNA only in heavy mitochondria. The DNA content grows under the effect of thyroxine in heavy mitochondria of young animals and is not changed after the insulin administration. Under the effect of thyroxine both the cytoplasmic and the mitochondrial protein-synthesizing systems and mitochondria division are activated. Insulin affects ATPase mainly via cytoplasmic translation and to a lesser extent via mitochondria.
