Genetic mapping of ribosomal protein cistrons of Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli was performed by phage P1 mediated, generalized transduction. From an E. coli hybrid strain which carried a S. typhimuirum F' factor, an E. coli strain was constructed which had integrated S. typhimurium genetic material including the region of the strA locus. Salmonella genetic material from this hybrid was transduced into E. coli recipients. The ribosomal protein electrophoretic patterns of these hybrid transductants were correlated with the presence of markers contributed by each parent. The results of these studies indicate that cistrons for at least three characteristic S. typhimurium and two E. coli 30S ribosomal proteins are closely linked to the strA locus on the genetic maps of both organisms. At least one cistron coding for a 50S ribosomal protein is also closely linked to this locus on both maps. These findings support the concept that cistrons coding for the ribosomal proteins are clustered in one area of the genome. Mutations to spectinomycin and streptomycin resistance are closely linked in S. typhimurium and are located at strA.
