Some of new cephem antibiotics, particularly the so called the third generation cephalosporins, are reported to be potent inducers of beta-lactamases and to be responsible for developing microbial cross-resistance to multiple beta-lactam antibiotics and occasionally to the aminoglycosides (Sanders and Sanders, 1983). In Japan, third generation cephalosporins such as cefotaxime, cefoperazone, ceftizoxime, and latamoxef became available in 1981, and cefmenoxime in 1982. Therefore, it is of interest to investigate changes, if any, in the antimicrobial activity of cefotiam (CTM) against various Gram-positive and negative bacteria, particularly to determine whether its antimicrobial activity has been reduced since 1982. Susceptibilities of clinical isolates of S. aureus (1,776 strains), S. epidermidis (2,247), S. pneumoniae (160), S. pyogenes (108), E. faecalis (1,930), E. coli (2,024), K. pneumoniae (1,913), Proteus spp. (950), E. aerogenes (823), Serratia marcescens (1,160), Citrobacter spp. (303), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (2,824), and H. influenzae (396) to CTM were studied. It was found that susceptibilities of these clinical isolates to CTM were not altered from 1981 to 1985, except S. marcescens. In 1985, susceptible strains of S. aureus, S. epidermidis, S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes and E. faecalis were 93.8, 93.4, 100, 100 and 0%, respectively. Those of E. coli, K. pneumoniae, Proteus spp., H. influenzae, P. aeruginosa, S. marcescens, E. aerogenes and Citrobacter spp. were 97.9, 97.7, 89.4, 94, 0, 10.8, 45.9 and 74.5%, respectively. The rate of susceptible strains of S. marcescens decreased from 34.7 to 10.8% since 1981 to 1985.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
