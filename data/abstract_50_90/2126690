Biochemical variations accompanying the acquisition of ethambutol (EMB) resistance in a single-step mutant of Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Ra were analyzed. Comparative analysis of phospholipids revealed a reduced content in the EMB-resistant strain, particularly in the cell membrane fraction. Significant alterations were observed in the individual phospholipid content and phospholipid fatty acyl group composition of whole cells and subcellular fractions. Quantitative changes were seen in the chemical constituents of the cell walls of resistant cultures in comparison with those of EMB-susceptible cultures of M. tuberculosis. Alterations in the binding of 1-anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonate to whole cells of an EMB-resistant strain indicated structural changes on the cell surface. Structural changes in the cell wall may play an important role in the resistance of M. tuberculosis H37Ra to EMB.
