Antibiotics alone or in combination may either inhibit or kill bacteria. Laboratory methods are available to determine the activity of various antimicrobial agents and can aid the physician in selecting appropriate antimicrobial therapy for specific infectious disease disorders. A few infectious processes appear to require bactericidal antimicrobial therapy for cure. Additional multicenter trials of the ability of a standardized SBT to predict therapeutic outcome in specific bacterial diseases are required.
