A total of 70 haemophili from Australia pigs was compared with a range of reference strains of porcine haemophili. Forty-eight of the isolates were identified as Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae biovar 1 and the remaining 22 isolates as Haemophilus parasuis. Forty one of the A. pleuropneumoniae isolates were used in a study to determine to the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 12 antimicrobial agents, or combinations of agents. Penicillin, neomycin, trimethoprim, trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole and tetracycline all showed low MIC values, indicating their potential for the treatment of porcine pleuropneumonia, although 2 isolates showed resistance to tetracycline. A wide range of MIC values was encountered with the sulphonamides.
