Augmentin (amoxycillin and clavulanic acid) is a new oral antibiotic combination which is particularly indicated in the treatment of urinary tract infections. Potentiation of amoxycillin by the clavulanic acid reduces the level of resistance in most Gram-negative urinary pathogens and these organisms are then sensitive to urinary levels of amoxycillin achieved on standard dosage. Clinical trials in urinary tract infections have shown a success rate of about 70 per cent for amoxycillin-resistant organisms. Augmentin in a dose of 375 mg tds is well tolerated and minimal gastrointestinal side effects occur. Augmentin is a novel antibiotic combination and will be particularly valuable in the oral treatment of urinary tract infections caused by multiply resistant bacteria.
