Scorodonin (1), a novel biologically active metabolite, was isolated from submerged cultures of the mushroom Marasmius scorodonius (FR.) FR. Its structure has been determined by chemical and physical methods. The antibiotic inhibits the growth of bacteria, yeasts, and filamentous fungi. In cells of the ascitic form of EHRLICH carcinoma the incorporation of thymidine and uridine into DNA and RNA is strongly inhibited by scorodonin whereas the incorporation of leucine into protein is not affected.
