The activity of enoxacin, a new quinolone carboxylic acid, was evaluated against 3014 clinical isolates of Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas and other non-fermenters and Staphylococcus aureus. Comparison was made with gentamicin, tobramycin, amikacin, netilmicin, ampicillin, piperacillin, carbenicillin, ticarcillin, ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid, trimethoprim, cotrimoxazole and erythromycin.
