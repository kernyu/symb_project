A disinfectant policy should provide information on all types of disinfectants and on procedures for their use. Requirements for chemical disinfection are mainly limited to cleaning areas of contaminated spillage, decontamination of certain heat-labile instruments e.g. fiberscopes, and disinfection of the skin. Antibiotic policies are necessary to ensure rationalization of therapy, to prevent the emergence of resistance, to limit or control the use of toxic agents and avoid the unnecessary use of costly agents. Hospitals should provide a list of freely available antibiotics and introduce varying restrictions on others. A short guide to therapy, especially prophylaxis, should be provided for the medical staff.
