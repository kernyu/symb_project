Small molecular weight plasmids from Staphylococcus aureus were characterized with respect to size, restriction enzyme cleavage pattern and transforming capacity. The plasmids pS194 and pC194 which encode streptomycin and chloramphenicol resistance respectively contained 3.0 and 2.0 megadaltons of DNA as determined by zonal rate centrifugation and electron-microscopy. Both plasmids transformed S. aureus wigh high efficiency. Plasmid pC194 contained only one cleavage site for endonuclease HindIII and pS194 contained single cleavage sites for HindIII and EcoRI. A natural recombinant between these two plasmids, pSC194, shared the high transforming capacity of the parental plasmids and contained one EcoRI site and two HindIII sites. pSC194 DNA also transformed B. subtilis with high efficiency. The recombinant plasmid pSC194 may be used as an EcoRI vector for construction and propagation of hybrid DNA in S. aureus as shown in the following paper (Lofdahl et al., 1978).
