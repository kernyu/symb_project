Benzimidazole resistant strains of Haemonchus contortus and Trichostrongylus colubriformis were each diluted with equal numbers of their respective susceptible genotypes and passaged in separate worm-free sheep. The progeny of the mixed susceptible and resistant infections were diluted with equal numbers of susceptible genotypes before passaging on two further consecutive occasions in worm-free sheep. In H contortus the amount of thiabendazole required to prevent a 50 per cent egg hatching (LC50) was reduced at each generation, but the reduction was significant (P less than 0.05) only at the third passage. In T colubriformis the LC50 for thiabendazole was reduced only at the first passage and thereafter remained constant. The reduction was not significant. In another experiment, the dilution with susceptible genotypes was made only at the first passage. Thereafter for two further generations the progeny produced from the mixed infection were passaged in worm-free sheep. In H contortus a reduced amount of thiabendazole was required to prevent a 50 per cent egg hatching at each generation, but did not reach a level of significance. The result for T colubriformis was identical to the continuous dilution experiment.
