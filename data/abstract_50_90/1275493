Cells of a strain of Pseudomonas cepacia were isolated from an oil-in-water emulsion containing methyl and propyl p-hydroxybenzoates (methylparaben and propylparaben) as preservative additives. This strain demonstrated the ability to destroy these additives, to utilize the propyl ester as sole carbon source, and to hydrolyze the methyl ester. When the isolate was grown on Eugon agar, exposure to the methyl ester killed 99.9% of the inoculum, but the surviving cells grew logarithmically. On the other hand, cells grown on media containing propylparaben were less susceptible when subsequently exposed to emulsions containing methylparaben. These observations demonstrate one mechanism by which microorganisms develop resistance to antimicrobial preservatives.
