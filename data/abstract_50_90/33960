Mir M7 is a spontaneous morphologically conditional mutant of Klebsiella pneumoniae which grows as round cells (cocci) at pH 7 and as normal rods at pH 5.8. We studied the rates of peptidoglycan synthesis of cocci and rods growing at pH values of 7 and 5.8, respectively. It was found that exponentially growing cocci produced a reduced amount of peptidoglycan per cell, compared with rods. Moreover, a shift of cocci to the permissive pH (5.8) caused an increase in the rate of peptidoglycan synthesis, whereas the reverse shift of rods to pH 7 determined a twofold reduction in the rate of [(3)H]diaminopimelic acid incorporation. During synchronous growth at pH 7, the rate of peptidoglycan synthesis after cell division decreased with time and rose before and during the first division. The susceptibilities of rods and cocci to beta-lactam antibiotics were also studied. It was found that cocci were more sensitive both to penicillin G and to cephalexin than were rods, but they showed a high level of resistance to mecillinam. The peculiar behavior of this mutant was interpreted as supporting the existence in bacterial rods of two different sites for peptidoglycan synthesis: one responsible for lateral wall elongation and one responsible for septum formation. In Mir M7, shape damage is described as dependent on the specific inhibition, at the nonpermissive pH, of the site for lateral wall extension.
