The in vitro activity of HR 756 was compared with penicillin, cefamandole, cefoxitin, and tetracycline against Neisseria gonorrhoeae. A total of 192 randomly selected isolates (of which 23 had minimal inhibitory concentrations of >/=0.5 mug/ml for penicillin) and three beta-lactamase-producing isolates were tested. HR 756 was the most active antibiotic tested, with more than 90% of the isolates inhibited by 0.008 mug/ml and all inhibited by 0.25 mug/ml.
