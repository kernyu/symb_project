A scheme of ergosterol cyclic intermediate transformations in S. cerevisiae has been proposed. It is based on the analysis of sterol composition in strains with mutant blocks of one or two reactions of enzymatic synthesis. Biochemical reactions of modification of cyclic part and side branch of sterol molecule are supposed to be carried out independently.
