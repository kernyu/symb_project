The mycobactericidal activity of 2% alkaline glutaraldehyde solution was determined using standardized suspensions of 10 species of atypical mycobacteria and compared with that for virulent Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Suspensions of M. avium, M. intracellulare and M. gordonae were more resistant to disinfection by the glutaraldehyde than were virulent tubercle bacilli while M. kansasii, M. scrofulaceum and M. szulgae were somewhat more susceptible. Mycobacterium marinum, M. smegmatis and M. fortuitum were highly sensitive to the disinfectant action of the alkaline glutaraldehyde solution. This variation in sensitivity shown by apparently closely related strains of mycobacteria to this disinfectant has important practical implications.
