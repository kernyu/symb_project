Polyenic antibiotics (levorin, amphotericin B, nistatin) inhibit in vivo and in vitro the activity of membrane alkaline phosphatase from sensitive Candida albicans strain, and their inhibitory effect is twice lower on the enzyme from the resistant strain. A correlation is observed between the antibiotic concentration and the inhibitory effect on alkaline phosphatase activity. Nistatin is found to be the least efficient inhibitor (among the antibiotics studied) of alkaline phosphatase. The treatment of membranes with polyenic antibiotics does not result in solubilization of membrane proteins nad alkaline phosphatase. The data obtained are considered with respect to the effect of polyenic antibiotics on cell membrane structure.
