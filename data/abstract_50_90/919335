Tested was the resistance of T. faviforme in pathological material to various disinfection agents. It was demonstrated that 1 per cent vofasteril, and 1.62 per cent perfumaric acid together with 1 per cent lauril sulphate and 5 per cent fessiasept kill the fungus at a 10 min. exposure. Perfumaric acid (1.62%), veraform (5%), fessiasept (3%) destroy T. faviforme for 15 to 20 min, and 0.6% vofasteril and 7-10% Cusulphate produce a fungicidal effect for 30 to 45 min. Fungicidal effects are produced with the use of veraform and vofasteril at the rate of 0.51/m2 of the disinfection solution. Aerosols, obtained by a method using no apparatus, employing 40 cm3 formalin, 20 cm3 water, and 30 g potassium permangante produce a fungicidal effect at a 20 h. exposure.
