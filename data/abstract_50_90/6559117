The genes that determine resistance to antibiotics are commonly found encoded by extrachromosomal elements in bacteria. These were described first in Enterobacteriaceae and subsequently in a variety of other genera; their spread is associated with the increased use of antibiotics in human and animal medicine. Antibiotic-resistance genes that determine the production of enzymes which modify (detoxify) the antibiotics have been detected in antibiotic-producing organisms. It has been suggested that the producing strains provided the source of antibiotic-resistance genes that were then 'picked-up' by recombination. Recent studies of the nucleotide sequence of certain antibiotic-resistance genes indicate regions of strong homology in the encoded proteins. The implications of these similarities are discussed.
