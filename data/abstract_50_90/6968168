Recently there has been increased recognition of Hemophilus influenzae as a cause of pneumonia in adults. Although ampicillin-resistant strains of Hemophilus influenzae have been a major problem in pediatric practice, such strains have not previously been noted to be a significant problem in the treatment of adult pneumonia. We report 5 cases of pneumonia caused by beta-lactamase-producing strains of Hemophilus influenzae. These organisms were susceptible to chloramphenicol but resistant to ampicillin. Cure was achieved by treatment with chloramphenicol after the initial treatment with ampicillin had failed. The ability of a microbiology laboratory to isolate and to test routinely for ampicillin-resistant strains is an important factor in the successful treatment of Hemophilus influenzae infections.
