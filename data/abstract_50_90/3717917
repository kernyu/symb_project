Three to four aminoglycoside inactivating enzymes were detected in cell-free extracts of clinical strains of gram-negative bacteria including Pseudomonas, Escherichia, Serratia, Enterobacter and Klebsiella and in cell-free extracts of their transconjugants. The clinical strains were selected by the feature of gentamicin resistance. All the strains contained AAC(3), APH(3') and APH(3"). In addition to these enzymes 12 out of 25 investigated strains contained AAD(2"). The biochemical characteristics of the gentamicin resistance determinant cloned from the clinical strains on the plasmid vector pUC 19 were studied. By the size of the insertion element pAA4 was the smallest among the constructed hybrid plasmids determining gentamicin resistance. It was shown that just this plasmid determined formation of the two gentamicin inactivating enzymes: AAC(3) and AAD(2") in the transformants carrying it.
