The bacterial cause of purulent meningitis in patients younger than 2 months of age was reviewed. Hemophilus influenzae was the most common organism isolated from infants 1 to 2 months of age. Gram-negative enteric organisms were not shown to cause meningitis in this age group in term infants without neonatal complications. Initial antibiotic therapy for infants in this age group should include ampicillin sodium and chloramphenicol sodium succinate.
