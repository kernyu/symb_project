Laboratory investigations were conducted to study potential mechanisms for prolonged survival of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in poloxamer-iodine (PxI). P. aeruginosa organisms isolated from PxI and adapted for growth in distilled water or found as part of a mixed microbial population from water in a manufacturing plant did not survive more than 15 s after challenge in stock PxI solution. Batches of PxI were compounded in the laboratory to determine the survival and growth of P. aeruginosa during the various stages of preparation. No P. aeruginosa organisms were recovered from the finished product at 1 min after the addition of iodine-iodide. However, we found P. aeruginosa in PxI 48 h after adding sterile PxI to the inside of a naturally contaminated polyvinyl chloride water distribution pipe. These organisms (10(4) CFU/ml) survived for as long as 98 days in contaminated stock PxI after it was removed from the polyvinyl chloride pipe. Both decreasing the free iodine level through addition of potassium iodide and increasing the free iodine level through dilution of the product resulted in an increased length of survival of P. aeruginosa in contaminated PxI solution. Comparative survival studies with pipes of different composition revealed that other materials may exert an effect similar to polyvinyl chloride. We concluded that polyvinyl chloride and perhaps other materials may play an important role in the survival of P. aeruginosa in iodophors and may be one source of resistant microbial populations when used in manufacturing plants which produce these antimicrobial solutions.
