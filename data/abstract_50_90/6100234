In this work, the sensitivity in vitro of cefoxitin, cefuroxime, cefotaxime, cefoperazone and cephalothin have been examined. Test of sensitivity in vitro have been performed as by Kirby-Bauer method as by measurement of MIC and MBC. Then the regression lines have been determined. Cefotaxime and cefoperazone provided nearly complete coverage of all Enterobacteriaceae; 80% were inhibited at less than or equal to 2 mcg./ml. This value is far below therapeutically attainable serum concentrations. Cefotaxime has MIC lower than cefoperazone. It has a significant spectrum of activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, nonenterococcal Streptococcus sp, non Enterobacteriaceae Gram-negative bacilli. Only enterococci and Acinetobacter species were relatively resistant to cefoperazone and cefotaxime. The cephalothin and the cefoxitin included excellent antimicrobial coverage of the staphylococci and the anaerobic bacteria respectively.
