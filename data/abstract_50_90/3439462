Patients admitted to a teaching hospital in Addis Ababa were studied for nosocomial infection. Of 2506 patients, 13% developed clinical infections, with the highest rate among obstetric/gynaecologic patients (17.0%). Wound infection was the most frequent type of nosocomial infection (49%) followed by urinary tract infection (25%). Antibiotic prophylaxis was given to 43% of the patients. Gram-negative bacteria comprised 88% of all isolated strains Enterobacteriaceae; 75% of all isolates were found in over 60% of the infection, Proteus 25%, Escherichia coli 20% and Klebsiella 19%. The most widely used antibiotics were ineffective against 65 to 85% of the Gram-negative strains. Cefotaxime and gentamicin were more effective. Staphylococcus aureus isolates were also similarly resistant, against which cephalothin, lincomycin and gentamicin were the more effective ones. Over 70% of the strains were multiple resistant. The findings underscore the need for a surveillance program and infection control system to reduce the high rate of infection and to institute appropriate guidelines for the use of prophylactic and therapeutic antibiotics.
