It was found that streptomycin administered to rabbits immunized with adsorbed staphylococcal anatoxin did not induce any decrease in the antitoxic antistaphylococcal immunity or suppress the activity of the nonspecific protection factors. The level of the antistaphyloccal immunity observed in the experiments provided the rabbit resistance to experimental staphylococcal infection and prevented its generalization.
