Chloroquine pressure was applied over a 22 month period on a somewhat isolated, malarious rubber estate by examination of residents at 4-week intervals and treatment of parasitaemias with chloroquine. During this time the monthly attack rate for P. falciparum rose four-fold to an average of nearly 18% per month, while that of P. vivax remained relatively constant at about 8%. Eight in vivo chloroquine resistance studies, which allowed both detection of late recrudescing R-I resistance and estimation of the risk of reinfection, showed an apparent rise in the drug resistance rate, from 12% to 20% prior to the study to the range of 40-50%. Virtually all resistance encountered was R-I in nature. There was no convincing evidence of chloroquine resistance among 148 tested P. vivax infections.
