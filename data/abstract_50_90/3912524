This report summarizes the results of joint studies in pediatrics on aztreonam, the first monobactam antibiotic for practical use. Pharmacokinetics was studied in 53 cases administered with 10, 20, 40 and 50 mg/kg of aztreonam (AZT) by intravenous injection and 20 cases with 10, 20, 30, and 40 mg/kg by drip infusion. All the cases had normal hepatic and renal functions at the administration. T1/2 was in a relatively fixed range of 1.35-1.56 hours in intravenous injection cases and 1.30-1.55 hours in drip infusion. One hour after commencing administration of standard 20 mg/kg, the serum concentrations were 50.18 +/- 4.24 micrograms/ml in intravenous injection and 116.33 +/- 10.18 micrograms/ml in drip infusion and even 6 hours after the end of the administration, they were 5.80 +/- 1.16 micrograms/ml and 3.38 +/- 0.58 micrograms/ml, respectively. The cerebrospinal fluid penetration was studied on suppurative meningitis (5 cases) and nonbacterial meningitis (3 cases). The penetration was generally good with sufficient concentration for meningitis caused by E. coli and H. influenzae. Amount of the penetration decreased as the cases were improved. Twenty-nine (29) cases were excluded and 262 cases of total 291 were clinically assessed, and the pathogen-isolated 167 cases of 262 were principally analyzed. Efficacy of AZT was "excellent" for all 3 cases of E. coli sepsis and 1 case of N. meningitidis meningitis and "good" for 1 case of H. influenzae meningitis. The effective rate was 94.6% for 37 pneumonia cases, 94.7% for 76 UTI cases and 88.5% on the whole including as many as 98 "excellent" cases. However, the effective rate for 21 enteritis cases was only 52.4%. Similar trend was observed in the pathogen-unknown group and overall effective rate of total 267 cases was 86.8%. The clinical effect by pathogen was 97.7% for 44 E. coli cases and 97.1% for 34 H. influenzae cases, showing excellent results for the GNB group. AZT was also effective for 8 out of 11 P. aeruginosa cases. With regard to microbiological effect by pathogen, AZT showed a high rate of bacterial elimination for GNB, primarily 98.1% for E. coli and 100% for H. influenzae followed by 76.9% for P. aeruginosa. However, it was only 30.0% for Salmonella. Excluding the Salmonella cases, GNB elimination rate was 93.5%. Clinical and microbiological dose response was not clear partly because, same as the previous studies, the effective rate of AZT was high. It was considered, however, standard dose of 20 mg/kg X 3 approximately 4 times a day was recommendable.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
