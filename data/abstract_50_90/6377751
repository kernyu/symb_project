In order to find out whether more than one test organism is needed for the determination of the activity of disinfectants towards mycelium-forming fungi and yeasts, eight different species of fungi and one yeast-like fungus were submitted to seven different disinfectants in varying concentrations. As Candida albicans was found to be the most resistant, the authors propose that only Candida albicans should be used.
