Markers controlling the synthesis of amino acids and organic bases as well as streptomycin resistance and sensitivity to acriflavine were transformed in Rhizobium trifolii. The results indicate that the str marker was transformed independently of leu, his, ade and trp markers. Co-transformation of leu and utra markers ranged from 3 to 7%, whereas that of thi and acr was 10%.
