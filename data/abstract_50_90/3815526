Baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells selected simultaneously with N-phosphonacetyl-L-aspartate (PALA) and methotrexate (MTX) gave rise to doubly resistant colonies at frequencies 20 to 260 times greater than the product of the independent frequencies found with PALA or MTX alone. Double resistance was due to amplification of both target genes, CAD and DHFR. Four independent doubly resistant "MP" lines were selected and characterized. Cells resistant to coformycin, pyrazofurin, or ouabain were generated from all four MP lines at rates up to 25 times greater than the rates for BHK cells. These three drugs select cells that have amplified the genes for their target enzymes. Therefore, we conclude that the four MP lines have an amplificator phenotype. All four grew much more slowly than BHK cells, indicating that the amplificator phenotype may be linked to significant defects in metabolism or cell division.
