During infection with bacteriophage varphiX174, a protein, made in the presence of 30 gamma chloramphenicol/ml but not made in the presence of concentrations greater than 100 gamma/ml, has been shown to be essential for viral DNA replication. A protein with similar chromatographic properties and "chloramphenicol resistance" has now been demonstrated in cells infected with lambda bacteriophage.
