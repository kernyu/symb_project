A chart has been developed for rapid reading of antibiotic zone inhibition. This method enabled the recording of whether the bacterium was sensitive or resistant to a drug in vitro. Two other devices were developed, for accurately reading the actual zone of inhibition when a clear medium was used, and also when an opaque medium was utilized.
