The authors compared broad-spectrum monotherapy with imipenem to an aminoglycoside-based antibiotic regimen for the management of intra-abdominal infections. One hundred and four patients who had intra-abdominal infection were randomly allocated to receive imipenem (52) or tobramycin plus clindamycin or metronidazole (52). Patients treated with imipenem had fewer febrile episodes and occurrences of breakthrough bacteremia, less antibiotic resistance and need for drug change; their hospital stay was shorter. The death rate from sepsis was 4% in patients who received imipenem and 13% in those who received the combined regimen (p = 0.08). Treatment was successful in 79% of patients on imipenem versus 67% of those receiving an aminoglycoside. Patient stratification by the APACHE II system and probability of death calculation using delayed-type hypersensitivity scores predicted a similar death rate for the two treatment groups. Imipenem appears to be a safe and efficacious alternative broad-spectrum antibiotic for treating patients who are seriously ill with intra-abdominal infection.
