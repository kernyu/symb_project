By restriction endonuclease cleavage mapping and electron microscopic examination of heteroduplexes, we have identified an ampicillin resistance determinant transposon, designated Tn1701, in a group of small, nontransferring plasmids which confer resistance to ampicillin (Ap), sulfonamide (Su), and streptomycin (Sm). Plasmid NTP1, which mediates Ap resistance, contains Tn1701. Recombinant plasmids NTP3 (Ap Su) and NTP4 (Ap Su Sm) contain Tn1701, indicating that they were derived by transposition of Tn1701 from NTP1 to an unrelated plasmid, NTP2 (Su Sm). The transposon Tn1701 is very similar to the known ampicillin resistance transposons Tn1, Tn2, and Tn3 in its size (3.2 x 10(6) daltons), base sequence homology observed by heteroduplex formation, restriction endonuclease cleavage sites, and possession of a short inverted repeat sequence at both ends. Like the other TnA elements, Tn1701 also specifies a type TEM beta-lactamase.
