The work was aimed at studying the effect of gramicidin S on the intact cells, spheroplasts and membrane specimens of Escherichia coli K12S with the natural resistance to this antibiotic. The resistance was shown to be caused by the barrier properties of the cell wall: the spheroplasts were highly sensitive to the lytic action of gramicidin S. The differences in the sensitivity to gramicidin S of substrate oxidation carried by the membranes of E. coli and Micrococcus luteus, a sensitive organism, were not of crucial significance for the manifestation of the resistance. The resistance was not associated with the decrease of gramicidin S adsorption: the cells were capable of binding large quantities of the antibiotic and remaining viable. Gramicidin S appeared to be attached to the cell walls (most likely, the outer membranes) rather than the cytoplasmic membranes.
