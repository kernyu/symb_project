In a group of 27 severely ill patients in an intensive care unit, 40 infections caused by Gram-negative bacilli were treated with temocillin 2g twice daily by the direct intravenous route. The patients (17 men and 10 women) were aged from 35 to 93 years (mean 65.7 years) and 22 had severe underlying diseases. In addition, 10 of the patients were admitted to the intensive care unit following surgery; 6 had acute renal insufficiency, 5 had acute respiratory insufficiency, and 12 were suffering from infectious shock. The infections included septicaemia (19), urinary tract infection (10), respiratory tract infection (4) and biliary tract infection (4). The most frequent bacterial isolate was Escherichia coli (14), followed by Enterobacter cloacae (5), Proteus spp. (5) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (4). The initial pathogens were eliminated in 34/40 infections (85%) and the corresponding clinical cure rate was 60%, with a further 27.5% of patients being improved. In the septicaemic patients, 17/19 pathogens were eradicated from the blood, while clinically, 12 patients were cured and 5 were improved. Eight of the 10 urinary tract pathogens were eliminated, with 6 patients being clinically cured and a further 3 being improved. All of the initial pathogens in both biliary tract and respiratory tract infections were eradicated, accompanied by clinical success in 3 and 2 patients, respectively; the remaining patients were improved. Superinfection with streptococcus group D, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus was seen in 3 patients. The emergence of resistance to temocillin occurred in an isolate of E. coli, and also possibly in an isolate of K. pneumoniae. No adverse reactions nor abnormal laboratory values related to temocillin administration were observed and, although 7 patients died, none of the deaths were attributable to uncontrolled Gram-negative infection.
