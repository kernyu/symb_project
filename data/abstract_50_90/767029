A discussion of postoperative infections in obstetrics and gynecology has been presented with particular emphasis on soft tissue infections involving the operative site. It has been emphasized that the offending organisms are those normally found in the vagina and cervix and that mixed infections are common. The immediate life threats to the patient are endotoxin shock and clostridial sepsis; therefore, initial therapy should include coverage for those organisms. Because of the potential toxicity of clindamycin and chloramphenicol, as well as the usual protracted course of Bacteroides infections, the addition of one of these drugs can generally be deferred until its use is dictated by microbiologic data or a failure of clinical response. Persistent fever generally indicates a lack of the appropriate antibiotic, an undrained collection of pus, or concomitant pelvic thrombophlebitis, the latter being a special concern with anaerobic infections. Specific infections and their management have also been discussed as have urinary tract and pulmonary infections and drug fever.
