247 strains of N gonorrhoeae were isolated from 453 patients with acute urethritis from 1985 to 1987. 19 strains produced beta-lactamase for a 7, 13 and 3% incidence in each of the 3 years. MIC between 1 and 8 micrograms/ml or between 65 and 256 micrograms/ml were found in 2 groups of beta lactamase producing strains. An increase in the sensitivity rate (81%) to penicillin of non beta-lactamase producing strains was observed in this period. The sensitivity to erythromycin and chloramphenicol remained constant while a slight increase in resistance to tetracycline was observed.
