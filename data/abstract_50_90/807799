400 sputa and 400 vaginal smears (each from 200 patients and 200 healthy subjects) were examined for candida. To establish "change of pathogen" and alteration of resistance, the isolated strains were differentiated and investigated for their sensitivity to amphotericin, gentian violet, Glyceromerfen, iodine, Castellani's paint, gentian violet-nystatin, nystain and BAY 5097. An attempt was also made to ascertain the germ count "suspected" of producing pathological conditions. Pathogenicity, diagnosis and therapy are discussed.
