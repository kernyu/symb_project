Three antibiotic-resistant strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae responsible for outbreaks of systemic infection in a hospital nursery were analyzed. Each organism emerged after prolonged use of a drug to which it was resistant. The first strain (RO16) produced neomycin phosphotransferase and contained three plasmids with molecular weights of 24, 25, and 30 X 10(6) daltons, respectively. Resistance to ampicillin, carbenicillin, neomycin, and kanamycin was transferred by conjugation at a frequency of 10(-6). The second strain of K. pneumoniae (RO106) produced gentamicin adenyltransferase and maintained aminoglycoside resistance only when propagated in antibiotic-containing medium. DNA analyses revealed eight species of plasmid DNA: one species with a molecular weight of 70 X 10(6) daltons apparently accounted for conjugal transfer of resistance to ampicillin, carbenicillin, chloramphenicol, and streptomycin. The third strain (RO180) was resistant primarily to colistin and lacked plasmids. Control of the outbreak due to this strain was achieved by aminoglycoside therapy.
