One hundred febrile episodes in neutropenic (PMN less than 500/mm3) patients were treated with Timentin alone or in combination with amikacin. The overall response rate in 87 episodes was 82.9% with Timentin alone and 84.5% with the combination. Eleven out of 15 patients with septicaemia were cured by Timentin alone and 12 out of 13 by the combination, a response rate of 73.3% and 92.4% respectively (not-statistically significant P = 1.307). The rates of superinfection were low. Few side effects occurred. Timentin is a useful antibiotic in the treatment of febrile neutropenic patients and was, in this study, as effective alone as in combination with an aminoglycoside in the initial therapy.
