17 primary health care (PHC) centres participated in a 1-month evaluation of a county urinary tract infection (UTI) management program. A total of 302 patients contributing 355 episodes, dominated by female (93%), lower symptomatic (75%) and Escherichia coli (74%) episodes were studied. In therapeutic failure gram-negative bacteria other than E. coli showed an increased prevalence whereas Staphylococcus saprophyticus was not found. The general pattern of drug resistance was little influenced by UTI history and the mean pretherapy prevalence of resistance to the 7 antibacterial agents studied was low (7%). Drug resistance was increased in failure (mean 24%) also for agents not used for therapy (sulphonamides and nitrofurantoin) but not in early or repeated recurrence. UTI symptoms were eradicated in only two-thirds of bacteriologically cured episodes but in one-third of the failures at the posttreatment control. On average, therapy resulted in 8% bacteriological failure and 12% early recurrence. The bacteriological cure rate was the same irrespective of whether the infecting bacteria were classified as sensitive or resistant in vitro to the drug given. Thus, sensitivity testing of isolates is rarely needed in sporadic or recurrent UTI in PHC but may be relevant in failure. In order to be of prognostic value in uncomplicated UTI high-level breakpoints focusing more on peak urinary drug concentrations need to be studied.
