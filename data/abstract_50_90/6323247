The plasmid mutation AntR determining multiple resistance to antibiotics--tetracycline and cycloheximide in Saccharomyces cerevisiae was earlier obtained and genetically characterized. In this work we describe experiments on cytoduction and transformation, proving the localization of this mutation in the yeast 2 mu DNA. As a result of cotransformation of the sensitive cells carrying a double mutation in the gene LEU2 with the yeast vector marked by LEU2 and 2 mu DNA obtained from the yeast AntR mutant, the Leu+ AntR clones were selected. Though the primary co-transformans contain both plasmids in an unlinked state, we managed to get clones in which the markers AntR and LEU2 were linked. The putative recombinant molecules were cloned in Escherichia coli and then introduced into the yeast recipient cells, differing by the presence of the endogenous 2 mu DNA. Retransformation of cir0 cells results in the appearance of the clones in which LEU2 and AntR markers segregate together. Thus, the result of cotransformation and selection in vivo is that the mutation of multiple resistance was included into the yeast vector plasmid, presumably, in its 2 mu part.
