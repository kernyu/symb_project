More than 4,000 susceptibility tests of antimicrobical agents performed in two years with six groups of microorganisms: 1) Staphylococcus, 2) Escherichia coli, 3) Proteus, 4) Enterobacter and Klebsiella, 5) Citrobacter, 6) Pseudomonas aeruginosa, have been compared. Percentages of antimicrobical resistance of every group are here related and statistically compared to discover significant susceptibility variations of bacteria isolated in 1973 and 1974.
