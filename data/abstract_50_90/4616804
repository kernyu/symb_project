A single-blind trial of oxolinic acid (750 mg. twice-daily for 14 days) and ampicillin (500 mg. 3-times daily for 14 days) in 60 cases with urinary tract symptoms showed superior results with oxolinic acid: 94% of pathogens were sensitive to oxolinic acid and 69% were sensitive to ampicillin. Sympotomatic relief and bacterial eradication occurred earlier in the oxolinic acid group.
