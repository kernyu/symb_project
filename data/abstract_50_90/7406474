Relationship between the etiological structure of hospital infections and antibacterial therapy was analysed. It was found that the wide use of antibiotics in medical practice changed the etiology of hospital infections in direction of predominance of gramnegative conditionally pathogenic bacteria, which are characterised by high resistance to antibiotics. Data on changing of staphylococcal sensitivity to antibiotics during the recent years are presented. The causes of this process are analysed.
