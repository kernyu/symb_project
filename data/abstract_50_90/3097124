The proliferative response of subpopulations of corticoresistant thymocytes (CRT) to phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) + interleukin 2 (IL 2) was investigated. Thymocyte subpopulations were selected by the indirect "panning" technique, and their purity was checked by cytofluorometry. Microcultures were set up with an optimal concentration of PMA, EL4 supernatant, or pure IL 2 obtained by recombinant DNA technology (r-IL 2) in the presence or in the absence of accessory splenic adherent cells (SAC). Under these conditions, only the Lyt-2+ CRT proliferated, and this response was IL 2-dose-dependent and was increased by accessory cells. When the calcium ionophore A23187 was added to the cultures, the proliferation of L3T4+ CRT was greatly increased. These results were confirmed by cultures at limiting dilution of positively selected Lyt-2+ and L3T4+ subpopulations of CRT at optimal concentrations of PMA, r-IL 2, A23187, and accessory cells. These results are consistent with the idea that two signals are necessary to activate L3T4+ CRT, whereas only IL 2 is necessary for PMA-induced proliferation of Lyt-2+ CRT. Finally, unlike the case of lectin-induced proliferation of Lyt-2+ and L3T4+ CRT, the presence of accessory cells or cell-cell contact is important for optimal response to PMA + IL 2.
