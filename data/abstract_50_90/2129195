The in vitro activity of mupirocin (pseudomonic acid), a new topic antibiotic, was evaluated against 70 S. aureus strains from health care staff of our hospital. The activity of the antibiotic was excellent, with a HIC90 of 0.25 mg/l. Mupirocin activity was higher than that of cloxacillin and bacitracin and similar to that neomycin.
