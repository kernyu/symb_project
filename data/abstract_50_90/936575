Decreased resistance to Krebs-2 ascitic carcinoma was demonstrated in mice which were in the state of hyporesponsiveness (tolerance) to virus interferon inducer (NDV) and increased resistance of the control mice to transplantation of tolerant carcinoma cells. Manifestations of tolerance in peritoneal and carcinoma cells were shown to be identical: interferon production and reproduction of vesicular stomatitis virus were inhibited, the number of viable cells was reduced, masked infection with NDV was detected, and the activity of cell enzymes was similarly changed. It is assumed that cellular manifestations of tolerance are the cause of reduced resistance of tolerant mice to ascitic carcinoma.
