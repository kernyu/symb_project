We have been investigating the effects of polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (pI:C), an interferon inducer, on the graft-versus-host reaction. We have previously shown that pI:C treatment of C57BL/6xAF1 (B6AF1) recipient mice immediately before injection of C57BL/6 (B6) parental lymphocytes inhibited the immuno-suppression and pathological changes normally caused by the GVH reaction, by a mechanism apparently identical to that seen in F1 hybrid resistance (HR) to hematopoietic grafts. We now demonstrate that delaying pI:C treatment by as little as 48 hr produces the opposite effect. Treatment of recipient B6AF1 mice at different days after transfer of parental lymphocytes induced a marked increase in the severity of the GVH reaction, as measured by a decreased plaque-forming cell response to sheep erythrocytes; decreased proliferative response to the T and B cell mitogens PHA, Con A, and LPS; increased pathological changes in both lymphoid and nonlymphoid tissues; and increased GVH-associated mortality. This effect is unrelated to HR, as pI:C was able to augment the severity of the GVH reaction when A strain cells were injected into AxCBAF1 recipients, which do not manifest HR. Early pI:C treatment (1 and 2 days after parental cell transfer) increased the severity of the GVH reaction much more than later pI:C treatment (7 and 8 days after parental cell transfer). This observation, along with the demonstration of altered pathology in GVH mice treated with pI:C, suggests that the effect of pI:C is not mediated through a direct suppressive effect of IF on the cells responding in either the PFC or mitogen assays, but rather by the ability of IF to activate or suppress mechanisms involved in the development of GVH-induced alterations.
