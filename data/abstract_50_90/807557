The rifampin-resistance mutation of LS3,an asporogenous mutant of Bacillus subtilis 3610, leads to altered mobility of the beta subunit of ribonucleic acid polymerase in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide slab gel electrophoresis. This finding argues that the rifampin-resistance mutation is located in the structural gene coding for the beta polypeptide.
