Pasteurella multocida was isolated from 42 of the 135 (31%) deep nasal swabs from clinically healthy conventional rabbits supplied by two vendors. The prevalences were significantly different among sex, age, and sources. The females and adults had higher prevalences when compared to males and juveniles, respectively. One vendor's rabbits had a prevalence of 41% while the other had 20%. Biochemically, only 24% of the 42 isolates decarboxylated L-ornithine, and 55% produced indol. All isolates were sensitive in vitro to several of the commonly used antibiotics, but most isolates were resistant to lincomycin, streptomycin, and sulfonamides. Typing with a hyaluronidase inhibition test revealed that 28 of the 42 (67%) isolates were type A. Type A was the major type isolate, whether the samples came from healthy rabbits or from rabbits with pyogenic lesions. The acriflavine flocculation test showed that two of the 42 (5%) isolates were type D. Although none of the 42 isolates were positive to both hyalurondase and acriflavine tests, 12 of the 42 (29%) isolates were negative to both tests, indicating that these isolates were not typeable by these two methods. The demonstration of more than one capsular type of Pasteurella multocida in rabbits indicates the need for more extensive studies on this important rabbit pathogen.
