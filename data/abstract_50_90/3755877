Levamisole, morantel, fenbendazole, or ivermectin was administered at 2-week intervals from May 1 through Sept 14, 1985, to breeding ewes (20 ewes/drug) infected with various gastrointestinal nematodes. All ewes had fewer gastrointestinal nematode eggs per gram of feces (epg) after 2 treatments, compared with pretreatment epg counts. Ewes administered ivermectin continued to have a low mean epg (0 to 3) throughout the study. The mean epg counts of ewes treated with levamisole increased from 3 to 483 during the study. This increase was similar to that of ewes treated with morantel (7 to 485 epg). The mean epg count of fenbendazole-treated ewes increased from 4 to 192 during the study. By the end of the study, the mean epg counts when expressed as a percentage of the pretreatment epg counts were 4% (ivermectin), 249% (fenbendazole), 627% (levamisole), and 630% (morantel). With the exception of the ivermectin-treated ewes, the epg count increased almost linearly in the ewes after the 2nd anthelmintic treatment. These data indicate that the gastrointestinal nematodes (including Haemonchus contortus) may have developed more resistance to levamisole and morantel than to fenbendazole. On the basis of the epg counts, resistance to ivermectin did not develop during the 4.5-month treatment period. The percentage of ewes shedding eggs after 2, 4, and 6 anthelmintic treatments was lowest for ewes treated with ivermectin (20%) and was similar (40%) for ewes treated with 1 of the other 3 anthelmintics. At the conclusion of the study, most of the ewes (90%) were shedding at least a small number of eggs, regardless of the anthelmintic treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
