Bacteriological investigation of urinary samples from 1,926 non-hospitalised patients with documented or suspected acute urinary tract infection revealed organisms pathogenic for the urinary tract in 56.4% of the patients, who came from various parts of West Germany. Prevalent pathogens were E. coli (69%) and Proteus mirabilis (14%). E. coli and P. mirabilis demonstrated a low rate of resistance against ampicillin, the cephalosporines, gentamicin, tobramycin, and also against nitrofurantoin, nalidixine acid and trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole. The situation was more unfavourable in the case of Klebsiella and indolpositive Proteus species however, there being a noticeably high proportion of strains resistant to gentamicin and tobramycin.
