The sensitivity of Plasmodium falciparum strains to Fansidar (500 mg sulphadoxine/25 mg pyrimethamine) was tested in vivo in six localities in the United Republic of Tanzania where chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum strains have been demonstrated by both in vivo and in vitro tests. Single doses as recommended by the manufacturers achieved 100% clearance of parasitaemia in five localities with mean clearance period of between 2.2 and 2.9 days. In one locality (Gonja) the recommended dose failed to clear parasitaemia in two of the 38 cases (5.3%) within seven days. The possibility of using this drug combination for the treatment of chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum strains in the United Republic of Tanzania is discussed.
