Three methotrexate (MTX)-resistant cell lines and their MTX-sensitive counterparts have been used to examine 2,4-diamino-6-(2,5-dimethoxybenzyl)-5-methyl-pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidine (BW301U), a novel lipophilic antifolate, and compare its cytotoxicity with MTX and metoprine. Collateral sensitivity for both BW301U and metoprine was observed in CCRF-CEM/MTX R-cells, where MTX resistance appeared to be primarily due to a deficiency in drug uptake. This was particularly pronounced with BW301U which proved to be as effective in killing CCRF-CEM/MTX R as was MTX with the parental CCRF-CEM cell line. This effect was not seen in other cell lines, L5178Y/MTX or L1210/MTX R, where resistance to MTX was correlated with either an overproduction of 5,6,7,8-tetrahydrofolate:nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidoreductase EC 1.5.1.3 (DHFR) or with combined uptake defect and increased DHFR levels, respectively. In each case, however, BW301U and metoprine, especially at high concentrations, were more effective than MTX in treating MTX-resistant cells.
