The effect of gentamycin was investigated at the University of Modena Phthisiology and Respiratory Diseases Department. In vitro activity against most pathological Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria was observed. A dose of 4-5 mg/kg proved very effective in cases of bacteria-induced bronchopneumopathy. The drug was also active against penicillin-resistant staphylococci and Gram-negative bacteria with a known resistance to ordinary antibiotics.
