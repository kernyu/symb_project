We have carried out laboratory and clinical studies of cefuzonam. The results were summarized as follows: The effectiveness of cefuzonam was estimated by a plate dilution method on 26 strains each of S. aureus, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, Salmonella spp. and P. aeruginosa and 27 strains of S. marcescens isolated from patients. The distribution of MIC's of cefuzonam against S. aureus was 0.39 approximately 1.56 micrograms/ml and the peak of the distribution was 0.39 microgram/ml. Strains of 96.2% of E. coli and Salmonella spp. were inhibited at cefuzonam concentrations less than 0.39 microgram/ml. Strains of 92.3% of K. pneumoniae were inhibited at drug concentrations less than 0.20 microgram/ml. The distribution of MIC's of cefuzonam against S. marcescens was less than or equal to 0.025 approximately 12.5 micrograms/ml and the peak of the distribution was 0.2 microgram/ml and 1.56 microgram/ml. MIC's against P. aeruginosa was 12.5 approximately greater than 100 micrograms/ml. Cefuzonam was given by 5-minute intravenous administration to 4 children and 1-hour drip infusion to 1 child at a single dose of 20 mg/kg. After the intravenous administration, mean serum levels of cefuzonam were 30.8 +/- 4.55 microgram/ml at 30 minutes, 13.8 +/- 1.83 micrograms/ml at 1 hour, 0.4 +/- 0.159 microgram/ml at 6 hours. The half-life was 1.12 +/- 0.198 hours. After the drip infusion, the serum levels of the drug were 38.7 micrograms/ml at 1 hour, 5.25 micrograms/ml at 2 hours and 0.087 microgram/ml at 7 hours. The half-life was 0.93 hour. The mean urinary excretion rate was 58.1% and 33.4% up to 6 hours after the intravenous administration and the drip infusion, respectively. Cefuzoname was effective in 4 out of 5 cases with bacterial infections. No side effect due to the drug was observed in any case.
