Resistance to at least one of the following antibiotics was found in eight wild-type strains of Aerococcus viridans: erythromycin (six strains), tetracycline and minocycline (five strains), chloramphenicol (one strain), and high levels of streptomycin (one strain). None of the strains transferred any of their antibiotic resistance markers into streptococcal, enterococcal, or A. viridans recipients by conjugation. By DNA-DNA hybridization experiments, the ermB gene of transposon Tn917, of Enterococcus faecalis origin, was detected in five of the six strains resistant to erythromycin and was localized for one strain on the chromosome and for four strains on nonconjugative small (4.7- to 4.9-kilobase) plasmids. The tetM gene of the conjugative transposon Tn916, of E. faecalis origin, was localized on the chromosome of four of the five strains resistant to tetracycline and minocycline; in three of these strains a structure similar to that of Tn916 was found. Homology to the tetO gene of pUA466, of Campylobacter jejuni origin, was detected on the chromosome of the fifth strain. No sequence homology was detected in any strain with probes corresponding to the tetL gene of group B Streptococcus origin, to the ermA gene of the transposon Tn554 of Staphylococcus aureus origin, or to the cat genes of either pC194 or pC221 of S. aureus origin.
