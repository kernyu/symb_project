A list of 117 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa has been selected for the resistance to carbenicillin. The study of these strains has shown that 22 p. cent were producing a constitutive beta-lactamase. These enzymes could be classified in CARB, TEM-type enzyme and OXA. A relation between their production of beta-lactamases and the MIC has been established.
