Within the framework of an investigation into otorhinolaryngoiatric bacterial infections in Italy conducted in 1159 patients (607 with otitis media, 354 with pharyngo-tonsillitis and 198 with sinusitis), 124 ceftazidime-treated subjects (92 with otitis media, 22 with pharyngo-tonsillitis and 10 with sinusitis) were observed. The authors report the examination of a number of microbial isolates obtained in the various forms of otorhinolaryngoiatric bacterial infection. Gram-negative organisms were found as causative agents in such diseases, particularly in otitis media. Bacterial resistance to ceftazidime was assessed in all 1159 cases and proved relatively infrequent (3.6%) and markedly less than the detected resistance to other antibiotics (10.7% resistance to cefotaxime, 35% resistance to ampicillin, 43% resistance to penicillin). Ceftazidime, used mainly in otitis media, showed very substantial clinical efficacy with positive results in as many as 97% of cases treated, which is particularly significant, if one considers that roughly 64% of the infections were caused by "difficult" gram-negative bacteria (49% by Pseudomonas).
