The antibacterial activity and pharmacokinetics of the beta-lactamase-stable cephalosporin cefuroxime and the gram-negative beta-lactamase-susceptible cephalosporin cefazolin were compared in two contrasting infection models in which Proteus morganii 82, which produces chromosomally mediated beta-lactamase, was the pathogen. In the rat paw model, characterized by high numbers of localized bacteria, cefazolin was destroyed at the site of infection and consequently did not produce a therapeutic response. In the mouse intraperitoneal model cefazolin was also inactive, despite peritoneal concentrations being unaffected by high counts of the beta-lactamase-producing P. morganii in the body cavity. In contrast the pharmacokinetics of cefuroxime was unaffected by the presence of the beta-lactamase-producing P. morganii, and good therapeutic responses were seen in both models.
