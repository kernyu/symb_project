An ampicillin-resistant strain of Neisseria denitrificans was produced by serial passage of the organisms in media containing increased concentrations of antibiotic. The 400-fold increase in resistance obtained was a relatively stable characteristic. Ampicillin resistance in this organism was apparently related to a loss or modification of the penicillin-binding proteins associated with the cytoplasmic membranes. Membranes isolated from the ampicillin-resistant strain bound significantly less radioactive penicillin than those isolated from the parent strain and revealed one major and three minor penicillin-binding proteins. All four penicillin-binding proteins were present in reduced amounts or had a decreased capacity for penicillin binding in the ampicillin-resistant cells. The increased resistance did not involve enzymic degradation of the antibiotic or a general reduction in the permeability of the outer layers of the cell. No difference in the amount of peptidoglycan present in the parent and ampicillin-resistant cells or in the gross chemical structure of the peptidoglycans of the two strains was observed.
