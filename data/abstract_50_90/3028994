Local treatment of 20 chronic bacterial ear infections (18 infected radical cavities, 2 external otitis) with a gyrase inhibitor (Ciprofloxacin) solution led to clinical resolution in 17 cases, with elimination of the causative organisms in 16 cases. No side effects were seen, but a resistant pseudomonas developed in one case, and candida albicans in 8 others. Gyrase inhibitors such as Ciprofloxacin are antibiotics of second choice. For local treatment in the ear they should be used only in difficult cases and exclusively by the otologist. This treatment must not be used to replace proper cleaning of the ear or a necessary operation.
