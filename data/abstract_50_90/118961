The synthesis of a new penicillin, disodium D-6-[alpha-(1,2,4-triazine-3,5-dione-6-carboxyamido)-4-hydroxyphenylacetamido]pen icillanate (BL-P1908), is described. The compound shows superior in vitro activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa compared to carbenicillin and ticarcillin and produces higher intramuscular serum levels in mice than does carbenicillin.
