Forty-three cases were studied to determine the most optimal timing to discontinue an oral antibacterial agent for preventing urinary tract infection after transurethral prostatectomy. On the 5th postoperative day intravenous antibiotic treatment was replaced by oral medication of 1.5 g talampicillin hydrochloride (TAPC, Yamacillin), which was tapered and discontinued depending on the urinary findings. Nine out of 15 cases who discontinued the medication within 2 weeks failed to keep the urine sterile. It may be advisable to continue the medication at least 3 weeks and to discontinue thereafter when pyuria has vanished. All 24 cases who followed this principle became sterile within 8 weeks. Medication continued over 8 weeks seemed to have no additional benefit. Four cases dropped out from this treatment mainly because of gastrointestinal symptoms.
