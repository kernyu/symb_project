The ability of Amphotericin B ('Fungizone') to alter the natural resistance of leukemia L1210 to vincristine was studied in BDF1 mice Neither Fungizone nor the "solubilizing agent" sodium deoxycholate, when used in combination with vincristine potentiated the activity of the drug against L1210. There was no change in the activity pattern of 5-fluorouracil against L1210 or vincristine against P388 lymphocytic leukemia respectively, which are sensitive to these drugs. Thus, both Fungizone and sodium deoxycholate failed to improve the activity of the drugs in either a naturally resistant or sensitive murine leukemia in vivo.
