A total of 256 patients were admitted in Germany into a Pan-European multi centre trial of doxycycline in the treatment of infections of the respiratory tract. The diagnoses showed a preponderance of lower respiratory tract infections compared with other European countries, due largely to the fact that the participating physicians were pulmonary or internal medicine specialists. Doxycycline was given in a dose of 200 mg initially followed by 100 mg daily for 5-10 days (only the occasional patient varied from this regimen). Side-effects were uncommon (2.5-3.5%) and affected only the gastrointestinal tract. Four patients had to change antibiotic therapy, not because of side-effects but because of possible bacterial resistance in these patients. The results were comparable with those from the rest of Europe: 88% of patients had a good or very good response. Nine patients were treated for longer than 14 days and only eight patients did not show improvement.
