Laboratory and clinical studies on cefsulodin (CFS), a new antipseudomonal cephalosporin antibiotic, were carried out and the following results were obtained. 1. The MIC of CFS against P. aeruginosa showed the peak of susceptibility at 3.13 mcg/ml in the inoculum size of 10(8) cells/ml and at 1.56 mcg/ml in the inoculum size of 10(8) cells/ml. It has a higher superiority as compared with gentamicin or piperacillin and gentamicin-resistant strains of P. aeruginosa were sensitive to CFS. 2. CFS was given to 3 patients with acute pneumonia and 5 patients with chronic cystitis which were all due to P. aeruginosa. Clinical effects were good in 2 patients and poor in a patient with acute pneumonia, and those were good in 3 patients and poor in 2 patients with chronic cystitis. Side effects were not recognized at all.
