Additions of potassium iodate to milk at 0.05 and 0.1 mM (10 and 20 ppm) before UHT treatment markedly reduced the rate at which pressure built up during processing. This permitted the use of longer processing times before unacceptable pressures were reached in the heat exchangers. Iodate reduced the amount of protein deposited, particularly in the higher temperature sections of the plant, but had no effect on the deposition of minerals. The more compact nature of the highly mineral deposits offered less resistance to the flow path. Reduction in the amount of protein deposited is likely to be caused by increased denaturation of beta-lactoglobulin and oxidation of heat activated sulphydryl groups by the iodate, thus reducing the formation of high molecular weight polymers of sulphur-containing proteins at the heated surfaces. Increasing the level of sulphydryl groups in the milk through the addition of L-cysteine-HCl caused an increase in the amount of deposit formed during UHT treatment. Whilst little detrimental effect on the quality of milk resulted from additions of iodate at 0.05 mM, milks with 0.1 mM-iodate became bitter during subsequent aseptic storage. Bitterness was a result of iodate-induced proteolysis of casein.
