Mutants of Halobacterium (H.) halobium and H. cutirubrum were isolated which are resistant to the 70S ribosome inhibitor thiostrepton. Using primer extension analysis, resistance was shown to correlate with base changes at position 1159, which corresponds to position 1067 of the E. coli 23S rRNA. In four mutants, A1159 was replaced by U, in one mutant by G. The results show that not only methylation (Cundliffe & Thompson (1979) Nature 278, 859-861) of A1067 (E. coli nomenclature), but also base changes at this position cause high-level resistance to thiostrepton.
