Sensitivity of 314 Salmonella strains of 16 serotypes of the main groups ABCDE isolated from patients with salmonellosis in 1975-1979 was studied with the method of standard paper disks with respect to levomycetin, streptomycin, tetracycline, monomycin, erythromycin, oleandomycin and in a part of the cultures to kanamycin, ristomycin, ampicillin, carbenicillin and polymyxin. 78 per cent of the strains fell within S. typhimurium. It was found that S. typhimurium had higher resistance levels to the above antibiotics and the so called "hospital" strains of the pathogens were mainly resistant simultaneously to 4-12 antibiotics. The Salmonella strains of the other serotypes isolated mainly in 1975-1977 preserved sufficient sensitivity to the antibiotics used for the most prolonged periods and most widely in therapy.
