The effect of a 3-day course of nalidixic acid was studied in 82 women, presenting with the dysuria-frequency syndrome and significant bacteriuria, mostly Escherichia coli sensitive to nalidixic acid. 62/76 patients (82%) that could be evaluated about 1 week after initiation of therapy were subjectively cured. Negative urinary cultures were found in 64/76 patients (84%). Two patients (2.4%) developed resistance to nalidixic acid. Bacteriological cure rate was 76% of 71 patients that could be controlled 1 month after the initiation of therapy. Nalidixic acid in the used granulate preparation initiated only mild side-effects.
