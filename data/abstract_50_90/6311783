Ceftriaxone, a broad spectrum cephalosporin with a markedly extended half-life, was administered to 68 patients with 71 infections in an open trial. Sixty-three infections (89%) had a satisfactory clinical response with eradication of bacteria present at the initiation of therapy in 62 infections (87%). The eight treatment failures correlated well with the development of resistance to ceftriaxone during therapy in Enterobacter and Pseudomonas species (two cases) and with superinfection with Bacteroides fragilis (three cases). Treatment was discontinued in eight patients because of unwanted effects. Serious side effects included leukopenia, rash, fever, and enterocolitis.
