In a prospective, double-blind trial, penicillin and clindamycin were compared in treatment of moderate to severe orofacial infections of odontogenic origin, which yielded pus on aspiration. Among 27 patients randomized to receive penicillin, 22 (81%) had a successful outcome, and five (19%) were improved. In the 28 clindamycin-treated patients, 23 (82%) had a successful outcome, and five (18%) were improved. No failures were noted in either group. One patient who was receiving penicillin and two who were receiving clindamycin developed diarrhea. Bacteriologic results showed an average of 6.1 organisms per culture (2.5 aerobes and 3.6 anaerobes). Resistance rates for anaerobic isolates were 8.9% to penicillin and 1.9% to clindamycin. It was concluded that penicillin and clindamycin produce similar good results in treating odontogenic infection when the rate of penicillin resistance among oral anaerobic bacteria is at a relatively low level.
