Chloramphenicol resistance (Cmr) plasmids pSK2 and pSK5 from Staphylococcus aureus and pSK102 and pSK103 from S. epidermidis have been characterised and detailed restriction endonuclease cleavage maps constructed. TaqI digestion profiles illustrated the identity of pSK5 and pSK102 and also revealed a high degree of similarity between these four Cmr plasmids from Australian staphylococci and three Cmr plasmids from S. aureus strains of geographically unrelated origin. DNA-DNA hybridisation indicated that the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase determinant carried by pSK5/pSK102 could be found on other structurally-distinct Cmr plasmids. The role of S. epidermidis as a reservoir for Cmr plasmids found in S. aureus is discussed.
