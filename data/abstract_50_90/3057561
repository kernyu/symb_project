The first macrolides were marketed almost 30 years ago. These drugs constitute a homogeneous class of antibiotics with very similar mechanisms of action and resistance. Owing to their specific antibacterial spectrum and their mild side-effects, interest in macrolides has now been renewed, notably because of their activity against bacteria that develop within cells. Recent studies have provided additional information on their pharmacokinetic profiles, and notably on their tissue and intracellular distribution.
