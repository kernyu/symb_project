The plasmid pIP231, determining tetracycline resistance and hydrogen sulfide production is shown to belong to incompatibility group Y and to code for a restriction and modification system. Unlike the IncY plasmids, P7 and P15B, plasmid pIP231 shows only little genetic and physical homology with P1 prophage.
