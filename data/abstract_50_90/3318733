The activities of chloroquine and amodiaquine against a sensitive strain of Plasmodium falciparum found in children in Ibadan were compared using an in vitro technique. The criterion for drug activity was the inhibition of maturation of the parasites. Three sets of experiments were performed with each of the two drugs. The minimum concentration of chloroquine causing 90% inhibition of maturation was 25 nmol as compared with 12 nmol for amodiaquine. This suggests a two-fold increase in activity of amodiaquine when compared with chloroquine against sensitive strains of P. falciparum. The implication is that amodiaquine is a much more potent tool in malaria chemotherapy than the erstwhile overused chloroquine.
