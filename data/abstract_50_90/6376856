Laboratory and clinical studies on ceftazidime ( CAZ ), a new cephem antibiotic, were carried out in the field of pediatrics. The results were as follows: Antibacterial activities of CAZ against clinically isolated strains of S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, E. coli and P. aeruginosa were compared with those of cefotaxime (CTX), ceftizoxime (CZX), latamoxef ( LMOX ), cefoperazone (CPZ) and cefmetazole (CMZ), and also with cefsulodin (CFS) and gentamicin (GM) against P. aeruginosa. Against S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae, CAZ was almost as active as CTX, CZX and CPZ. Against E. coli, it was almost as active as CTX, CZX and LMOX . Against P. aeruginosa, it was almost as active as CFS and GM. Serum concentrations and urinary excretion rates after intravenous bolus injection of CAZ at doses of 20 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg for 5 minutes in each 2 cases (4 cases in total) were determined. The mean serum concentrations of CAZ were 78.9 and 52.0 micrograms/ml at 15 minutes, 38.5 and 27.4 micrograms/ml at 1 hour, and 6.5 and 4.8 micrograms/ml at 4 hours, with serum half-lives (T 1/2) of 1.39 and 1.80 hours respectively. Mean cumulative urinary excretion rate within 6 hours after administration was 84.6%. In a patient with chronic renal failure, serum half-life was 3.22 hours and urinary excretion rate within 6 hours was 22.8% (after intravenous bolus injection of CAZ at a dose of 10 mg/kg). CAZ was administered at a dose of 55.5 mg/kg by intravenous bolus injection to a child with purulent meningitis. The levels of CAZ in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) at 1 hour after administration were 2.7-38.9 micrograms/ml with CSF/Serum ratios of 3.2-28.8%. Forty-two pediatric patients with various bacterial infections (pyelonephritis 14, tonsillitis 1, bronchopneumonia 3, pneumonia 17, purulent meningitis 1, bacteremia 2, SSSS 1, enterocolitis 3) were treated with CAZ at a daily dose of 49-222 mg/kg t.i.d. or q.i.d. (as a rule 60 mg/kg t.i.d.). The efficacy rate was 97.6% clinically and 97.8% bacteriologically. No adverse reactions were observed except 1 case with mild diarrhea. Abnormal laboratory findings were also only mild; eosinophilia in 1, slight elevation of GOT in 5 and that of GOT & GPT in 3 cases. These results indicate the usefulness of CAZ in the treatment of bacterial infections in children.
