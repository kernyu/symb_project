Fourteen patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia were treated with partially pure leukocyte interferon (HuIFN alpha). The binding of recombinant leukocyte clone A IFN and the induction of 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase (2,5A) in peripheral blood cells were studied to determine whether they correlate with clinical response to IFN therapy. The mean pretherapy binding of radiolabeled recombinant leukocyte clone A IFN to peripheral blood cells was 0.053 +/- 0.02 (SE) fmol (53 +/- 20 amol)/10(6) cells and 0.049 +/- 0.015 fmol/10(6) cells in sensitive and resistant patients, respectively. Twenty-four h after the first HuIFN alpha dose, the binding of recombinant leukocyte clone A IFN decreased 3- to 8-fold in both sensitive and resistant patients. The activity of 2,5A synthetase was induced approximately 100-fold in sensitive patients from a pretherapy mean of 3 +/- 2 nmol/mg to a maximum of 317 +/- 184 nmol/mg during therapy. In contrast, 2,5A synthetase was induced from a pretherapy mean of 0.9 +/- 0.9 nmol/mg to only 6.7 +/- 4.9 nmol/mg in resistant patients. In two patients originally sensitive to HuIFN alpha who developed resistance to therapy, receptors were present in both sensitive and resistant disease stages and appeared to down regulate with therapy regardless of response. In these two patients, 2,5A synthetase was significantly induced with therapy in the sensitive stage but not in the resistant stage. This study shows that lack of clinical response to interferon therapy may coincide with failure to induce 2,5A synthetase activity. This suggests that resistance to alpha-interferon therapy may be mediated by events beyond receptor binding resulting in a failure to induce enzymes responsible for mediation of interferon antiproliferative effects.
