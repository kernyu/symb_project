In a 22-month period, strains of Staphylococcus aureus resistant to methicillin and multiple aminoglycosides, (designated MARS) were recovered from 108 inpatients with nosocomial infections at a hospital in the midwestern United States. Sixty-six of these patients were staying in a burn unit, and 42 were on other hospital wards. Among the patients with burns, MARS were recovered from the burn wounds of 64%; 32% of the patients with burns had MARS bacteremia. The patients without burns were age-matched with patients with nosocomial infections caused by antibiotic-susceptible strains of S. aureus. Patients from whom MARS were isolated had a longer mean hospital stay (79.6 days vs. 36.9 days; P less than 0.01), developed infection later (26.5 days vs. 13.5 days after admission; P less than 0.01), and had received antibiotic therapy before infection more often (81% vs. 38% of patients; P less than 0.01) than patients in the comparative population. Types of infection and incidences of death and bacteremia were similar in the two groups. Antibiotic-resistant strains of S. aureus may cause serious infections and significant mortality.
