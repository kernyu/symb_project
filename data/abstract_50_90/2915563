From March 1984 to March 1987, a simple closed method, previously described for the treatment of osteomyelitis after orthopedic operations, was used to treat deep sternal infection in 11 patients. The basis of this technique is, after meticulous debridement of the wound, to drain all the infected areas with small catheters connected to a bottle inside of which a strong (700 mm Hg) negative pressure is created (Redon drainage device). The method does not require irrigation. The maximum duration of the drainage was 24 days and complete recovery was obtained in all patients without further surgical treatments. The comfort of the patients was optimal.
