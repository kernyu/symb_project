Trophoblastic disease of pregnancy presents a continuous spectrum ranging from the non-invasive mole to the choriocarcinoma; modern chemotherapy has radically changed the prognosis of the latter. A pregnancy without mole was followed by choriocarcinoma with a high titer of chorionic gonadotrophin and vaginal, pelvic, and pulmonary metastasis, clinically apparent shortly after premature delivery. Neurologic phocality was manifested a few days before the onset of labour, and its relationship with the basic disease is discussed. A definitive cure was obtained by intermittent massive chemotherapy along with surgical resection of an isolated thyroid metastasis (a previously unreported location) and, posteriorly, of a pulmonary metastasis, both appearing during chemotherapy. The control of the therapeutic response by periodical monitoring of chorionic gonadotrophin levels is necessary in order to detect resistance to therapy and, eventually, to confirm definitive cure of the disease.
