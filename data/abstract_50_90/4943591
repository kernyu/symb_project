Clotrimazole has a broad spectrum of activity against yeast and filamentous fungi in vitro and also in vivo when given orally or parenterally to experimentally infected mice and when administered orally or topically to infected guinea pigs. In vitro a distinct inoculum effect has been observed with a number of strains of Candida and Torulopsis; minimal inhibitory concentrations have tended to increase with increased incubation time. With prolonged incubation times, resistance can be developed to clotrimazole in vitro, but this resistance is readily reversible upon passage in drug-free broth. The degree of in vivo activity of clotrimazole against Candida depends on the severity of infection used. Orally it appears to be more effective when administered by gavage than when given mixed in the diet. Pretreatment with the agent may decrease its efficacy because of drug inactivation. Against dermatophytes, clotrimazole has a degree of activity similar to griseofulvin when given orally, but it is less active than tolnaftate topically in cutaneous infection of Trichophyton mentagrophytes in guinea pigs. In vitro, but not in vivo, some gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria are inhibited by low concentrations of clotrimazole.
