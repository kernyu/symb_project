Previous studies have demonstrated that organisms detected by urine screening can be processed for rapid identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing directly from urine or urine screening broth. In the present study, an improved method for processing such specimens was evaluated. Organisms were harvested by centrifugation from positive urine screening broth, and inocula were prepared for rapid identification by the Micro-ID system and rapid susceptibility testing by the Autobac system. Nearly 2,500 urine specimens were analyzed by urine screening, and 206 specimens had significant growth of gram-negative, oxidase-negative bacilli. These organisms, prepared by the centrifugation procedure, were identified and tested for susceptibility to antimicrobial agents. For comparison, identifications by the Micro-ID system and antimicrobial susceptibility tests by the Autobac system were performed on the same organisms the next day with inocula prepared from colonies growing from standard urine cultures. The results demonstrated that 95% of the organisms were correctly identified by this procedure, and susceptibility testing by the rapid method gave results in 94% agreement with the standard method. These results demonstrate that organisms detected by urine screening can be accurately identified and tested for antimicrobial susceptibility after centrifugation from urine screening broth. This system provides a practical procedure or same-day reporting of urine culture results.
