The fate of 75Se-labelled schistosomula in mice treated at 24 h post-infection with either Ro 11-3128 or oxamniquine, compared to untreated controls, was followed by compressed organ autoradiography. No difference in the total percentage of schistosomula detected as foci was found between the three groups at each sampling time. However, the distribution of schistosomula was altered. In oxamniquine-treated mice there was a delayed migration from the skin relative to controls and fewer parasites in total appeared to reach the lungs. In Ro 11-3128 treated mice very few parasites left the skin. Ro 11-3128 treatment induces resistance to challenge whereas oxamniquine does not. The fate of challenge schistosomula in previously infected Ro 11-3128 treated mice was also compared to that in control mice. There was evidence for delayed or reduced migration from the skin of Ro 11-3128 treated mice. Significant death of challenge parasites occurred in the lungs, or post-lung sites in both control and treated mice. It was not possible to conclude that any of the late attrition was immune-dependent in the treated mice and the results appeared to indicate that a significant fraction of parasite death occurred at the skin stage.
