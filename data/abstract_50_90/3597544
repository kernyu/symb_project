Survival after H2O2 exposure or heat shock of asynchronous Chinese hamster ovary cells (HA-1) was assayed following pretreatment with mildly toxic doses of either H2O2 or hyperthermia. H2O2 cytotoxicity at 37 degrees C, expressed as a function of mM H2O2 was found to be dependent on cell density at the time of treatment. The density dependence reflected the ability of cells to reduce the effectiveness of H2O2 as a cytotoxic agent. When the survival data were plotted as a function of mumoles H2O2/cell at the beginning of the treatment, survival was independent of cell density. Cells pretreated with 0.1 mM (3-5 mumoles/cell X 10(-7)) H2O2 for 1 hr at 37 degrees C (30-50% survival) became resistant to a subsequent H2O2 treatment 16-36 hr after pretreatment [dose modifying factor (DMF) at 1% isosurvival = 4-6]. Their resistance to 43 degrees C heating, however, was only slightly increased over controls 16-36 hr following pretreatment (DMF at 1% isosurvival = 1.2). During this same interval, the synthesis of protein migrating in the 70 kD region of a one-dimensional SDS-polyacrylamide gel was enhanced twofold in the H2O2-pretreated cells. When the cells were heated for 15 min at 45 degrees C (40-60% survival), the survivors became extremely resistant to 43 degrees C heating and somewhat resistant to H2O2 (DMF at 1% isosurvival = 2). The heat-induced resistance to heat developed much more rapidly (reached a maximum between 6 and 13 hr) following pretreatment than the heat-induced resistance to H2O2 (16-36 hr). The enhanced synthesis of 70 kD protein after heat shock was greater in magnitude and occurred more rapidly following preheating than following H2O2 pretreatment. The cells that became resistant to H2O2 by either pretreatment (H2O2 or heat shock) also increased their ability to reduce the H2O2 cytotoxicity from the treatment medium beyond that of the untreated HA-1 cells. This may be one of the mechanisms involved in the increased resistance and a common adaptive mechanism induced by both stresses. These data indicate that mammalian cells develop resistance to H2O2 following mild pretreatment with H2O2 or heat shock. The cross-resistance induced by H2O2 and heat shock reinforce the hypothesis that some overlap in mechanisms exist between the cellular responses to these two stresses. However, the failure of H2O2 pretreatment to induce much resistance to heat indicates that there are also differences in the actions of the two agents.
