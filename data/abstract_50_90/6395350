Four of the five veterinary E. coli strains, which were unable to transfer their antibiotic resistance by conjugation, were found to harbour plasmids. Evidence from transformation, agarose gel electrophoresis and curing experiments showed that in strains KE-3, KE-4 and KE-14 a nonconjugative R plasmid carried the gene for resistance to tetracycline. The plasmids in KE-9 were cryptic.
