Activity of alkaline phosphatase as well as its substrate specificity in Vibrio el tor and in nitrofurantoin resistant Vibrio el tor have been studied. A lower level of activity is observed in Vibrio el tor after its acquisition of resistance towards nitrofurantoin. The enzyme activity in both the strains is significantly inhibited by EDTA, and also by metal ions like Mg++, Zn++ and Mn++. The normal strain is found to possess two isoenzymes for alkaline phosphatase whereas the resistant strain has only one isoenzyme.
