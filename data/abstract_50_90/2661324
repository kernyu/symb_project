A novel beta-lactamase, conferring resistance to ceftazidime, has been identified to be encoded by a 31 kb plasmid (pUK720) in a clinical E. coli strain isolated in Belgium. The beta-lactamase, new designated TEM-E1, has a pI of approximately 5.4 and lies in between the iso-electric focused bands of the beta-lactamases TEM-1 and TEM-7. The TEM-E1 beta-lactamase has a similar molecular weight of 22,000 to the TEM-1 and it is also inhibited by clavulanic acid. However, the TEM-E1 enzyme differs from TEM-1 by its low rates and efficiency of hydrolysis for ceftazidime and cefotaxime, TEM-E1 has similar efficiency of hydrolysis values for ceftazidime and cefotaxime, but only confers resistance to ceftazidime.
