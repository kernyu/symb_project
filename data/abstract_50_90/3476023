A cross sectional study was carried out in children receiving treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia to determine the prevalence of trimethoprim resistant organisms in their gut flora and to compare this with a control population. There was a significantly higher prevalence of trimethoprim resistant bacteria in the study group (61%) compared with controls (14%). A longitudinal study showed that emergence of these organisms was intermittent during treatment.
