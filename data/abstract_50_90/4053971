The interaction of ethanol with erythrocyte ghosts and vesicles composed of brain lipid extracts labelled with indium-111 was studied using the sum peak ratio method of perturbed angular correlation measurements. Membranes from animals that were fed diets containing ethanol for 10 days demonstrated resistance to the decrease in sum peak ratio values observed in control animals. Thus, repeated administration of ethanol induces changes in the properties of biological membranes, possibly by altering phospholipid composition, which is reflected in the anisotropy of membrane-associated 111In-labelled nuclei as measured by sum peak ratios.
