The trimethoprim-resistant dihydrofolate reductase associated with the R plasmid R388 was isolated from strains that over-produce the enzyme. It was purified to apparent homogeneity by affinity chromatography and two consecutive gel filtration steps under native and denaturing conditions. The purified enzyme is composed of four identical subunits with molecular weights of 8300. A 1100 bp long DNA segment which confers resistance to trimethoprim was sequenced. The structural gene was identified on the plasmid DNA by comparing the amino acid composition of the deduced proteins with that of the purified enzyme. The gene is 234 bp long and codes for 78 amino acids. No homology can be found between the deduced amino acid sequence of the R388 dihydrofolate reductase and those of other prokaryotic or eukaryotic dihydrofolate reductases. However, it differs in only 17 positions from the enzyme associated with the trimethoprim-resistance plasmid R67.
