Antiseptics are mainly microbiostatic, relatively insoluble compounds, with little ability to penetrate into the skin or the mucous membranes. They can be used prophylactically or therapeutically on various areas of the body surface (skin and the mucous membranes, e.g., of mouth, intestinal-, respiratory-, and urogenital tract). If used in this way, they do not generally cause toxic effects, though sensitization to safe antiseptics may occur. The use of chemotherapeutic agents as antiseptics should be avoided wherever possible, because of the risk of emergence of resistant bacteria; but it would be clearly indicated if this were the only way to save a patient's life. Resistance to antiseptics is less likely to emerge than to antibiotics.
