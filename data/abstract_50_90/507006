Neonatal infections have been caused by Streptococcus bovis, a nonenterococcal group D Streptococcus. A recent case of neonatal meningitis caused by this organism prompted a literature review regarding appropriate antibiotic therapy. Although most reports suggested penicillin therapy alone for S bovis meningitis, isolates of this organism that were as resistant to the lethal effect of penicillin as the enterococcus have been recovered. Therefor, it was recommended that until the results of minimal inhibitory concentration and minimal bactericidal concentration tests are known both an aminoglycoside and a penicillin be used simultaneously. Proved susceptibility to the penicillin would justify discontinuation of the aminoglycoside therapy. Physicians caring for neonates with S bovis should be aware that some strains may be resistant to the lethal effect of penicillin.
