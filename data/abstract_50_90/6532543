The susceptibility in vitro of aerobic bacteria to cefoxitin and other cephalosporins was determined. The strains were isolated from clinical specimens during 1979 and 1983. The in vitro activity of cefoxitin and other antibiotics against anaerobic bacteria was investigated. The resistance of 5 cephalosporins to inactivating enzymes of bacterial origin was compared.
