Antibiotically active producer mutants derived from the spontaneous degenerate parent Aspergillus versicolor N5 possessed not only mutual but also self-sensitive activity. The producer mutants, like the inactive parent, were only 3.5-fold less sensitive than the most sensitive unrelated organism, Trichophyton rubrum. The germination of spores is generally more sensitive than growth of vegetative cells. The antifungal spectrum of these mutual and self-sensitive mutants was fairly wide, unlike the host range specificity of bacteriocinogenic strains acting on organisms closely related to the producers. The self and mutual growth inhibitory principle was finally identified as the antibiotics mycoversilin and versilin in the case of producer mutants (N5)17 and N5T10(7), respectively, or Vx, an antibiotic of unknown molecular species, in the case of another producer mutant N5T10(8). Thus self-sensitivity, instead of self-resistance, of these antibiotically active mutant derivatives is a unique property among filamentous fungi in having simultaneously expressed two loci of contradictory functions, one for synthesis of, and the other for sensitivity towards, the same or related antibiotics.
