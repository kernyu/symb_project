A 6.8-kilobase-pair (kbp) transposable element (Tn4556) was found in a neomycin-producing strain of Streptomyces fradiae. This element was first observed in two 30.3-kbp plasmids (pUC1123 and pUC1124) which arose when a thiostrepton resistance gene (1 kbp) was ligated with the BclI-2 fragment (22.5 kbp) that contains the origin of replication of phage SF1. The Tn4556 segment was deleted when these plasmids were transduced into another S. fradiae host with phage SF1. These deletion plasmids (pUC1210 and pUC1211) had copy numbers of less than 1 per chromosome and were unstable. In contrast, pUC1123 and pUC1124, with copy numbers of 12 to 15 per chromosome, respectively, were relatively stable. When pUC1210 and pUC1211 were reintroduced into S. fradiae by protoplast transformation, the Tn4556 element transposed again to the plasmids at numerous new locations in either of two orientations. A copy of Tn4556 was found in the S. fradiae chromosome by hybridization studies. It appears that Tn4556 originated from the chromosome, transposed into unstable pUC1210 and pUC1211, and made stable plasmids. A temperature-sensitive hybrid plasmid carrying a viomycin resistance derivative of Tn4556 (pMT660::Tn4556::vph) was constructed. When Streptomyces lividans UC8390 containing the hybrid plasmid was grown at 39 degrees C, Tn4556::vph (Tn4560) transposed to random positions in the host chromosome.
