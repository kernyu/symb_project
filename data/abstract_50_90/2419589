Bacteriophage T5 did not grow at the nonpermissive temperature of 42 degrees C in Escherichia coli carrying a temperature-sensitive mutation in gyrB [gyrB(Ts)], but it did grow in gyrA(Ts) mutants at 42 degrees C. These findings indicate that the A subunit of host DNA gyrase is unnecessary, whereas the B subunit is necessary for growth of T5. The necessity for the B subunit was confirmed by a strong inhibition of T5 growth by novobiocin and coumermycin A1, which interfere specifically with the function of the B subunit of host DNA gyrase. However, T5 growth was also strongly inhibited by nalidixic acid, which interferes specifically with the function of the A subunit. This inhibition was due to the interaction of nalidixic acid with the A subunit and not just to its binding to DNA, because appropriate mutations in the gyrA gene of the host conferred nalidixic acid resistance to the host and resistance to T5 growth in such a host. The inhibition by nalidixic acid was also not due to a cell poison formed between nalidixic acid and the A subunit (K. N. Kreuzer and N. R. Cozzarelli, J. Bacteriol. 140:424-435, 1979) because nalidixic acid inhibited growth of T5 in a gyrA(Ts) mutant (KNK453) at 42 degrees C. We suggest that T5 grows in KNK453 at 42 degrees C because its gyrA(Ts) mutation is leaky for T5. Inhibition of T5 growth due to inactivation of host DNA gyrase was caused mainly by inhibition of T5 DNA replication. In addition, however, late T5 genes were barely expressed when host DNA gyrase was inactivated.
