In a double-blind study geriatric patients received either 410 mg sulphadiazine plus 90 mg trimethoprim (co-trimazine) or 800 mg sulphamethoxazole plus 160 mg trimethoprim (co-trimoxazole) twice daily. The investigation was carried out in order to compare the clinical efficacy and safety of co-trimazine in relation to co-trimoxazole with special emphasis on laboratory data in elderly patients suffering from uncomplicated urinary tract infections. Two to four weeks after start of treatment the original pathogen was eradicated in 80% of the 40 patients that were assessable for the effect of co-trimazine therapy, and in 77.8% of the 39 assessable patients in the co-trimoxazole group. There were no statistically significant differences between the two treatment groups in terms of laboratory data. Both drugs were well tolerated.
