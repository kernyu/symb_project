Characteristics of pBR322/Ad h 1 DNA recombinants were studied which had been cloned using HindIII restriction endonuclease in a single "shot-gun" experiment. Both oxytetracycline and ampicillin resistance of the clones were found to be heterogeneous. Ad h 1 DNA fragments HindIII-A, and -C could be cloned only in combination with other fragments. Among the possible reasons of the loss of recombinants upon transfection the impairment of pBR322-specific gene functions by the inserts is discussed in addition to the increased tetracycline resistance, and the tertiary structure of recombinant DNA.
