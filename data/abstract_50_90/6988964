The toxicity of heavy metals to bacteria, with particular reference to metal forms and species, has been reviewed. Factors which influence metal forms and thus their potential toxicity, such as pH, chelation and competitive interactions have been discussed. The mechanisms whereby bacteria may influence the forms of heavy metals to which they are exposed have been discussed with reference to the importance of the role of bacteria in immobilisation and environmental cycling of metals. Bacterial resistance to metal toxicity is an environmentally important phenomenon. It may occur from non-specific mechanisms, such as impermeability of the cell, or it may be due to specific resistance transfer factors. The coincidence and co-selection of resistance factors for antibiotics and heavy metals in bacterial populations and the clinical implications of this have been described.
