The Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell 40S ribosomal subunit protein S14 provides a unique opportunity to investigate an important mammalian housekeeping gene and its mRNA and protein products. The S14 gene appears to be single copy, and CHO cell S14 mutants have been isolated as emetine-resistant (emtB) clones in tissue culture. Thus, S14 is the only mammalian ribosomal protein whose gene structure and function are amenable to straightforward genetic and biochemical analysis. Recently, we isolated a wild-type Chinese hamster lung cell cDNA clone, pCS14-1, including an almost complete copy of the ribosomal protein S14 message (N. Nakamichi, D. D. Rhoads, and D. J. Roufa, J. Biol. Chem. 258: 13236-13242, 1983). Here we describe comparable cDNAs from wild-type and emtB CHO cells. We report both mRNA and polypeptide sequences of the wild-type and mutant ribosomal protein transcripts. As a consequence of the genetic methods used to obtain our emetine-resistant mutants, the emtB S14 cDNAs differ from wild-type cDNA by single-base changes. Physical and chemical features of polypeptides encoded by the cDNAs are consistent with well-characterized S14 protein polymorphisms. The three emtB mutations analyzed affect two adjacent arginine codons within the very basic S14 carboxyl region, indicating a significant role for this portion of the protein in the function and architecture of the mammalian 40S ribosomal subunit.
