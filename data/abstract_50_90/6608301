Forty-two cases of children showing recurrent urinary tract infection were treated. Three treatment guides were used: the first group of children were given trimetoprim-sulphametoxazole (TMP-SMZ) only, the second and third ones were treated with TMP-SMZ and alternative nitrofurantoine in the former or nalidixic acid in the latter. After treatment a meaning reduction in frequency of urinary tract infection cases (p less than 0.001) were observed. Best results (lesser percentage of failures and lesser number of urinary tract infection cases per month of observation) were achieved in the second and third groups, probably due to a high percentage of resistance cases against TMP-SMZ found during prophylactic treatment (72.07).
