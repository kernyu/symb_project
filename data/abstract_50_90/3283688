By studying the sensitivity to antibiotics of 74 Acinetobacter baumannii strains, four phenotype groups were distinguished. The resistance of one of them (11% of the strains) to imipenem, argues against the therapeutic attitudes that now prevail. From studies on the kinetics of bactericidal activity of antibiotics and there association we propose what should be done in the laboratory to provide help to the physician for the antibiotic choice.
