Staphylococcus aureus, a laboratory strain 209-P and strain I isolated freshly from infected wounds, as well as lincomycin hydrochloride, ampicillin, oxacillin and methicillin manufactured in the USSR and cephaloridin manufactured by "PLIVA" in Yugoslavia were used. Various activity levels of desoxyribonuclease and lecitinase of the staphylococci depending on sensitivity or resistance of the test-microbe to the antibiotics were shown. The activity of the above microbial enzymes characterizing the pathogenic properties decreased with development of the antibiotic resistance, sometimes to complete inactivation of the enzymes synthesized by the staphylococci. In spite of closeness of their modes of action the semisynthetic penicillins had a differentiating effect on the above enzymes.
