Drug effects were monitored by the measurement of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation into parasite deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). Cells are pulse-labelled with BrdU and those which are synthesizing DNA incorporate BrdU into their DNA. Anti-BrdU is used to identify cells undergoing DNA synthesis at the time of the pulse. Concentration-effect curves were determined for chloroquine, pyrimethamine and quinine in culture for only 3 h in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with BrdU. Different strains of Plasmodium falciparum could be distinguished when BrdU uptake was monitored by the ELISA. This assay offers a fast and accurate method of monitoring the effects of a variety of antimalarial drugs.
