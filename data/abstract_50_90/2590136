Composite strains of Trichostrongylus colubriformis and Ostertagia spp consisting of 0, 1, 10, 25, 50, 75, 90, and 100% of known resistant strains were prepared and tested for benzimidazole resistance using faecal egg count reduction tests, in vitro egg hatch assays and tubulin binding assays. All tests detected resistance where the proportion of the resistant strain in the composite was 50% or more, whereas none of the tests unequivocally detected resistance below 25%. Egg count reduction tests were no less sensitive than the in vitro tests in detecting low levels of resistance but the egg hatch and tubulin binding assays provided a better quantitative estimate of moderate to high levels of resistance. Faecal egg count reduction therefore, provides a suitable means of detecting resistance in the field but tests, more sensitive to low levels of resistance are required. Results indicate that the use of post-treatment counts alone provides an adequate indication of anthelmintic efficiency.
