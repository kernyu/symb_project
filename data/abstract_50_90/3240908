Eighty-nine fosfomycin-resistant mutants of group A and B streptococci were isolated. The mutants differed essentially from the parent strains in cell-wall characteristics, such as morphology of cocci and chains, sensitivity to detergents and hydrophobic properties. At the same time, the recipient activity of the investigated mutants was not changed. It is supposed that resistance of mutants to fosfomycin is connected with a transport block of glycerol 3-phosphate--important lipoteichoic acid (LTA) structural component. Fosr mutants can be useful for experimental examination of Beachey's hypothesis about the importance of LTA or its complex with the M protein for adhesion.
