Allelism of pleiotropic drug resistant (pdr) mutants was evaluated by complementation tests, linkage to chromosome-VII centromere markers and response to a partial suppressor (sur). Complementation tests were confounded by incomplete dominance and somatic segregation. Phenotypic suppression by sur was observed for all mutant and wild type alleles and thus could not be used to distinguish alleles. Five different alleles were tentatively identified by their close linkage to leul; 88 tetrads from three factor crosses produced the following linkages--leul (4.7) pdrl (17.0) trp5. Resistance of DRI 9/T7, a [cir o] strain of French origin, was not inherited as an allele of pdr but was controlled by a different pleiotropic centromere linked gene. An evaluation of published data suggest that antl, AMYl, till, cyh3, BOR2, and axe1 may be alleles of pdr. Thus pdr appears to be an allele that influences permeability to many inhibitors.
