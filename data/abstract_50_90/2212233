Ten field-collected strains of the German cockroach, Blattella germanica (L.), with varying levels of pyrethroid resistance were tested for possible cross-resistance to abamectin administered as a bait. The time-mortality method was used for comparison of response with a known susceptible strain in 10-d feeding experiments. Essentially no resistance to abamectin was found. Extensive feeding inhibition occurred after a few days, but the amount of abamectin consumed varied substantially from strain to strain. Abamectin may have considerable potential as a cockroach bait insecticide.
