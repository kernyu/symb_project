Plasmid pJP4 is an 80-kilobase, IncP1, broad-host-range conjugative plasmid of Alcaligenes eutrophus encoding resistance to mercuric chloride and phenyl mercury acetate and degradation of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, 2-methyl-4-chlorophenoxyacetic acid, and 3-chlorobenzoate. By the use of cloning, transposon mutagenesis, and restriction endonuclease analysis, a biophysical and genetic map of pJP4 was generated.
