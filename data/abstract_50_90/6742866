Five patients with multiple myeloma were treated with human lymphoblastoid interferon (HLBI). HLBI, 3 X 10(6) IU/day, was administered daily for more than two weeks by intramuscular injection. Out of four evaluable patients, a minor response was obtained in 3 patients. In these responders, one patient developed pleural effusion due to the infiltration of myeloma cells during the administration of HLBI, and drug resistance was observed in another patient during the re-administration of HLBI. Therefore, out of six evaluable courses, a minor response was obtained in 3 courses of HLBI treatment. No severe side effects were observed. Thrombocytopenia, general malaise, liver dysfunction and anorexia were the main reasons for discontinuation of HLBI administration. On the basis of the preliminary study, it is concluded that HLBI is worth trying in the management of refractory multiple myeloma.
