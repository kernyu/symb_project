The study group was organized to evaluate the usefulness of cefmenoxime (CMX) injection, a new synthetic cephalosporin, for the treatment of infections in the field of obstetrics and gynecology. Fundamental and clinical studies were made by the society and the following results were obtained. 1. The peak distribution of CMX's MIC for E. coli, Klebsiella sp., Enterobacter sp., Bacteroides sp. and Peptococcus sp. isolated from obstetrical and gynecological infections with relatively high frequencies area 0.1, less than or equal to 0.05, 0.2, 3.13, 1.56 micrograms/ml, respectively, with an inoculation of 10(6) cells/ml. 2. When 1 g of CMX is administered by intravenous drip infusion for 1 hour, the maximum concentrations in various tissues of female genital organs were as follows: 14.2 and 13.2 micrograms/g in ovary and oviduct, respectively, at 1.20 hours after the start of administration, and 16.9 and 26.3 micrograms/g in corpus uteri and cervix uteri, respectively, after 1 hour. As for the transfer to the exudate in the pelvic dead cavity, the peak concentration was 15.6 micrograms/ml after 2.13 hours. 3. In the clinical studies, CMX was given to 258 cases with female genital organ infections and others. As for the clinical effects, with exclusion of 3 cases in which other antibiotics are concomitantly used, responses were excellent in 76 cases, good in 162 cases and poor in 17 cases, among 255 cases in total. The efficacy rate was 93.3%. The efficacy rates by diseases were 97.1% (68/70) for intrauterine infections, 88.8% (79/89) for intrapelvic infections, 98.4% (62/63) for adnexitis, and 100% (23/23) for infections of external genital organs. As for the clinical effects on causative bacteria, the efficacy rates were 100% (19/19) for single infections due to Gram-positive bacteria, 94.8% (55/58) for single infections due to Gram-negative bacteria, and 88.2% (15/17) for single infections due to anaerobic bacteria. And its efficacy rates were 89.6% (69/77) for mixed infection cases. Side effects were observed in 2 cases (0.8%); 1 case with eruption, and 1 case with diarrhea and vomiting. As for abnormal laboratory findings, lower white blood cell count was observed in 2 cases and elevation of the values regarding hepatic functions in 9 cases. All cases were returned to the normal after the completion of the administration. Cefmenoxime showed a satisfactory clinical efficacy and a potent bacteriological effect in treatment of the infections in the field of obstetrics and gynecology, and it has been concluded that cefmenoxime will be useful addition to the antibiotics for the therapy of these infections.
