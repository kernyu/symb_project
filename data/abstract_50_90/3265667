Bacteraemia with Haemophilus pneumonia is uncommon. To determine its incidence and features case notes of patients in whom Haemophilus spp. were isolated from blood and pleural fluid over a five-year period were reviewed. Eight adult patients with H. influenzae bacteraemia were identified, five of whom had pneumonia on clinical and radiographic criteria. Only one patient had a predisposing factor, chronic obstructive lung disease. Two patients had beta-lactamase producing isolates, one of whom developed an empyema, following treatment with ampicillin, which required surgical drainage. Four patients were elderly, aged 69-80 yrs and were clinically in shock at the time of diagnosis. Seven of the eight patients survived.
