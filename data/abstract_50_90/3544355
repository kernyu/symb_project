The sensitivity of Plasmodium falciparum to chloroquine was studied in 140 children in two locations in Western Kenya. The standard WHO in vivo field test was used and chloroquine phosphate 25 mg base/kg administered in divided doses over three days. In one area 13.2% of cases had recrudescent parasitaemias, while in the other area 8.2% of infections were resistant, with 3.5% having an RII pattern. The remaining isolates were sensitive to chloroquine. Further in vivo and in vitro tests in the region are needed to document the extent and level of resistance.
