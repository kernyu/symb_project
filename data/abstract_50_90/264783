Seven patients with metastatic tumors resistant to therapy with adriamycin, BCNU, plus cyclophosphamide received the same chemotherapy combined with amphotericin B. One complete response (acute myelomonocytic leukemia), two partial responses (carcinoma of the breast and multiple myeloma), and one case with objective improvement (carcinoma of the breast) were observed in seven evaluable trials. Myelosuppression was not consistently changed by addition of amphotericin B. Fever and chills were common after amphotericin B. Bronchospasm and hypotension occurred twice. Amphotericin B reverses resistance to adriamycin-containing chemotherapy regimens in some patients.
