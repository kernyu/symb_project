The physical characteristics of a mutant, R(M201-2), capable of conferring high and stable ampicillion resistance was analyzed. The R(M201-2) and its parent R-factor deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) could be isolated as an extrachromosomal and covalently closed circular form. Their buoyant densities were both 1.712 g/cm(3), and their molecular weights were about 82 x 10(6) and 64 x 10(6), respectively, when measured by CsCl and sucrose density gradient analyses. The contour lengths by electron microscopy were 35.9 +/- 0.6 and 31.0 +/- 0.6 mum, respectively. By using the extracted R-factor DNA, the mutant and parent characters were transformable to another Escherichia coli strain. The mutant R factor showed an increased amount of DNA even after conjugal transfer to Proteus. An increase in the size of R-factor DNA was thus considered to be the cause of the high level of ampicillin resistance.
