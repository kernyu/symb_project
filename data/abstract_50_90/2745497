The wet disc antimicrobial solution assay, an in vitro method to test susceptibility/resistance of burn wound-isolated microorganisms against antimicrobial solutions for topical use, is described. Where antibiotic discs for Kirby-Bauer testing were available for antibiotics contained in the topical solutions, Kirby-Bauer assays were done, and the results were compared with those derived using the wet disc assay. More microorganisms were susceptible using the wet disc method compared with the Kirby-Bauer method. The wet disc method could be used to test topical antimicrobial solutions that had no Kirby-Bauer disc equivalent. The wet disc method provided more reliable information for the clinician to use in choosing appropriate topical antimicrobial solutions for treating patients' wounds than the Kirby-Bauer method.
