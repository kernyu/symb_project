The morphology and thermal resistance of vegetative cells of Bacillus subtilis W168 were examined after growth at 37 and 53 C. Vegetative cells grown at 37 C exhibited a typical trilaminar morphology, whereas cells grown at 53 C exhibited a cell wall which was apparently thicker and more loosely organized and had a poorly defined periphery. A concurrent increase in thermal resistance to a heat shock of 60 C occurs with the change in cell wall morphology. The change to the aberrant cell wall form, or its reversal to the normal form, is always accompanied by the gain or the loss of thermal resistance, respectively. The inhibition of protein synthesis by chloramphenicol has little effect upon the acquisition of thermal resistance at 53 C. Addition of the disaccharide pentapeptide subunit to the cell wall peptidoglycan is apparently essential to growth at 53 C and the acquisition of thermal resistance, since both growth and thermal resistance are inhibited by bacitracin. Two antibiotics, penicillin and cycloserine, which inhibit the final cross-linking of the cell wall peptidoglycan at two separate points, do not affect the acquisition of thermal resistance at 53 C. These same antibiotics induce a high degree of thermal resistance at 37 C. It is proposed that a change in the cell wall structure is related to an increased thermal resistance.
