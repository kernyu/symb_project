In vivo chloroquine resistance surveys, which allowed for detection of late recrudescing RI resistance, were conducted in three regions of Peninsular Malaysia, which were previously not recognized as having appreciable drug resistance. Among the 485 Plasmodium falciparum infections tested resistance rates ranged locally from 20% to 67% in those with parasitaemias over 1,000 per mm3, and 5% to 59% in all parasitaemias. The region found to have the most serious resistance was western Pahang. In one study a combination of chloroquine and pyrimethamine proved no more efficacious than chloroquine alone. Most of the resistance encountered was the late recrudescing RI type. There was no apparent correlation between drug resistance and Anopheles balabacensis as this species was not found despite intensive collections in two of the three main regions. There was no evidence of resistance among the 222 P. vivax and 35 P. malariae infections also tested.
