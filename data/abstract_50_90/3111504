A derivative of the broad-host-range plasmid RP1, pME301, was temperature-sensitive (Ts) at 43 degrees C for maintenance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, P. mendocina, Klebsiella aerogenes and Escherichia coli. In E. coli, the Ts defect of pME301 could be complemented in trans by the cloned trfA gene, which is known to be essential for RP1 replication in E. coli and P. aeruginosa. Because pME301 expressed a Ts phenotype in P. mendocina and K. aerogenes, we assume that the trfA function is also vital in these organisms. When plasmid-encoded carbenicillin resistance (on transposon Tn801) was selected at non-permissive temperatures in P. aeruginosa strain PAO carrying pME301, we obtained either Tn801 insertions into the chromosome or pME301 derivatives having a deletion (or point mutation) in their tet genes, which determine resistance to tetracycline and are not transposable. From cloning experiments, we infer that the tet gene product(s) destabilize the pME301 replicon in P. aeruginosa at 40-43 degrees C.
