The efficacy of single-dose therapy with cefonicid (1 g intramuscularly) and multidose therapy with amoxicillin (500 mg orally three times a day for 7 days) was compared for the treatment of uncomplicated lower urinary tract infection in women. Of 50 patients with symptoms of lower urinary tract infection randomized to receive either cefonicid or amoxicillin, 39 were infected with greater than or equal to 10(5) bacteria per ml. At early posttherapy follow-up (5 to 18 days), 19 of 21 (90%) cefonicid-treated patients and 16 of 18 (89%) amoxicillin-treated patients were cured. At late posttherapy follow-up (6 to 7 weeks), 16 of 18 (89%) cefonicid-treated patients and 14 of 15 (93%) amoxicillin-treated patients were cured. One patient was lost to follow-up in each late follow-up group. There were fewer side effects in the cefonicid-treated group. There were significantly more organisms resistant to amoxicillin than to cefonicid in the study population. Considering the small size of the series, single-dose therapy with cefonicid for lower urinary tract infection in women appears to be as safe and effective as conventional multidose therapy with amoxicillin.
