Three hundred and fifty-one strains of enterococci were isolated from 2,337 clinical materials including urine, blood, pus and other during 6 months of spring and summer in 1977. Urine was the most frequent source of the organism among them. As for species, S. liquefaciens was isolated most frequently (45.5%), being followed by S. zymogenes (26.5%) and S. faecalis (21.5%) in order. The susceptibility of the isolates was tested with 10 antibiotics. In general, the majority of the strains were resistant to several antibiotics, but almost all the strains were susceptible to ampicillin and benzylpenicillin. The susceptibility of S. liquefaciens, S. zymogenes and S. faecalis to 10 antibiotics was similar with each other in pattern, while that of S. faecium and S. durans was considerably lower.
