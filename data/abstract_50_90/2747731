Domoic acid, a recognized neurotoxin derived from contaminated samples of the blue mussel (Mytilus edulis L.), was analyzed for mutagenicity at 2 loci and for 2 cytogenetic parameters in a hepatocyte-mediated assay with V79 Chinese hamster lung fibroblasts. Genetic end-points measured were: mutation to 6-thioguanine resistance at the HGPRTase locus; mutation to ouabain resistance at the Na+,K+-ATPase locus; sister-chromatid exchange (SCE) and micronucleus frequency (MN). None of these genetic end-points was significantly affected by exposure to domoic acid at dose levels of 27.2 and 54.4 micrograms/ml with or without activation by freshly isolated rat liver hepatocytes. It was concluded that, within the limits of the test system employed, domoic acid was non-genotoxic to V79 cells.
