A fundamental and clinical study of ceftizoxime (CZX), a new cephalosporin antibiotic, has brought about the following results. 1. The antibacterial activity of CZX against Bacteriodes fragilis and B. thetaiotaomicron was superior to that of CEZ, but inferior to that of CFX. CZX was the most active of the 3 drugs against B. distasonis, and was as active as CFX against B. vulgatus. The MICs of CZX against Peptococcus, Peptostreptococcus and anaerobic Streptococcus were 1.56 microgram/ml or lower. CEZ was more active than CZX against these anaerobic cocci. 2. The concentrations of CZX in female genital organs and retroperitoneal dead space exudate after drip infusion of 1 g were high enough to fulfill the MICs of many bacterial isolates. 3. CZX administered intravenously to 9 patients in daily doses of 1 approximately 8 g for 4 approximately 11 days was 100% effective. Pathogenic bacteria in 6 of the patients were eradicated in 4 and partially eradicated in 1. The other patient had no bacteriological examination after therapy. 4. No adverse reaction was observed. From above results it is concluded that CZX must be one of the most effective antibiotics for the treatment of gynecological infections.
