Seventy-two patients with H. pylori infection in their antral mucosa took part in the study. Forty-three received metronidazole 400 mg t.d.s. for two weeks, plus De-Nol tabs 2 b.d. for four weeks, and the remaining 29 patients received metronidazole 400 mg t.d.s. for two weeks plus De-Nol liquid 5 ml q.d.s. for four weeks. Seven of 57 H. pylori isolates were found to have pre-treatment metronidazole resistance. Success, in terms of eradication of H. pylori, was assessed using a one-month post-treatment 14C urea breath test. Successful eradication of H. pylori was achieved in 72% and 79%, respectively, of the metronidazole/De-Nol tablet and metronidazole/De-Nol liquid groups. These figures increased to 87% and 84%, respectively, if the patients whose organisms were known to be metronidazole-sensitive were considered in isolation. H. pylori was successfully eradicated in only one of seven patients with a metronidazole-resistant organism.
