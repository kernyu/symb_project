Malaria is a persistent problem in the tribal dominated Koraput district of Orissa state. Plasmodium falciparum is the predominant parasite species accounting for about 90% of the infections in the locality. Chloroquine sensitivity of P. falciparum was carried out in 4 Primary Health Centres (PHCs) and Muran project area in the district. A total of 139 cases were subjected to in vivo extended test, of which resistance was detected in 11 at RI and in 2 at RII level. One case out of 16 subjected to standard 7 day in vivo test showed resistance at RII level. Micro in vitro test was done for 17 cases of which 8 were found to be resistant. Majority of cases of resistance were from Malkangiri PHC and Muran project areas. The implications of the findings are discussed.
