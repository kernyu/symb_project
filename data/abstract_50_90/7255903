Benzimidazole resistant strains of Haemonchus contortus and Ostertagia spp were subjected to selection pressure over five laboratory generations with the recommended dose rates of either cambendazole, oxfendazole or morantel. A change in response, with larger residual worm burdens remaining after treatment at the fifth generation, was shown for both cambendazole and oxfendazole against both species of nematode. No change in response against either species are shown for morantel. The results are discussed in terms of the problem associated with inefficient removal of the adult parasites after treatment.
