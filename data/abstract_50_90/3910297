In eastern Thailand, falciparum malaria is highly chloroquine-resistant and is quickly becoming quinine-resistant. In the present study, ten patients with falciparum malaria were given large doses of erythromycin, combined with standard doses of chloroquine; the cure rate was 0 out of 10 (4 RIII failures, 6 RII failures). A further ten patients were given erythromycin with standard doses of quinine; 2 of the 10 patients were cured (8 RI failures). These regimens thus appear to have no appreciable effect against falciparum infections in eastern Thailand.
