The in vivo and in vitro response of Plasmodium falciparum to a single oral dose of mefloquine (25 mg/kg body weight (M25) or 15 mg/kg (M15] was studied in children under 5 years of age in Malawi. Of the children who received mefloquine, 35% vomited at least once, and 10% did not tolerate the drug because of vomiting. The therapy failure rates for the M25 group on day 7, 14, and 28 were 15%, 18%, and 42%, respectively, and these did not differ significantly from those for the M15 group (4%, 18%, and 59%). In contrast, 34 in vitro microtests (17 per group) showed schizont inhibition at less than or equal to 32 pmol mefloquine per test well. On day 7, the concentration of mefloquine in samples of blood was significantly lower in both the M25 and M15 groups for children who were parasitaemic on day 7 than in samples from those who were aparasitaemic. A positive blood smear on day 7 was strongly associated with a mefloquine concentration of less than 500 ng/ml blood on day 2 or day 7 (P less than 0.0003). Vomiting was associated with a low mefloquine concentration on day 2 but not day 7. These results suggest that mefloquine is effective against P. falciparum in Malawi but that for young children the therapy appears to be complicated by frequent vomiting.
