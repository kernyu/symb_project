A cohort of 66 workers professionally exposed to vinylchloride (VC) in a plant producing polyvinylchloride was examined in years 1979 and 1985 by same methods. Significant changes of the levels of immunoglobulins (Ig), lysozyme and transferrin were not observed during the six years in the subgroup of smokers. Nevertheless a highly significant rise of alpha 2 macroglobulin (A2M) and ceruloplasmin (CPL) levels in this subgroup was stated. The levels of IgA and IgM significantly rose in the subgroup of ex-smokers, as well as highly significant increase of A2M was noted in this subgroup. The levels of IgG and A2M rose with highly significance in the subgroup of non-smokers; the CPL increase was only of weak significance. Many significant differences in means were assessed between subgroups of exposed workers and age matched control persons. No significant correlation between the levels of the tests and the time of exposure to VC was observed by regression analysis. In the discussion an opinion about possible premature aging of persons exposed to VC was brought forward.
