The effect of some immunostimulants (bacterial lipopolysaccharide prodigiosan, active thymic peptide T-activin, synthetic compound levamisole) on the anti-infection resistance and metabolic function of the liver (hexobarbital sleeping-time) was studied on noninbred male mice. It was found that when administered in doses and under schedules that protected mice against lethal infection (Pseudomonas pyocyanea, i.p.) prodigiosan and levamisole inhibited metabolism of hexobarbital. T-activin was inactive in both tests. The possible mechanism of correlation is discussed.
