The relationship between capsular polysaccharide types 5 and 8 and resistance of Staphylococcus aureus to oxacillin was studied with a collection of 406 clinical isolates from six French hospitals. Of 175 type 5 isolates, 84 (48%) were resistant to oxacillin. In contrast, only 8 of 160 type 8 isolates (5%) and 5 of 71 nontypeable isolates (7%) were resistant to oxacillin. Therefore, capsular typing of clinical isolates of S. aureus may facilitate the choice of first-line antibiotic therapy.
