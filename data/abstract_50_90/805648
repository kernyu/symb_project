In a multicentre trial of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) for the treatment of uncomplicated gonococcal urethritis, optimal results were achieved with a regimen of six tablets once daily for 3 days. Treatment failure was found to be related significantly to the relative resistance to SMX of the pretreatment isolate. Further, the difference between therapeutic results from various geographic areas could be correlated with the relative sensitivity of pretreatment isolates to both SMX and TMP for that area. In view of these observations the role of TMP-SMX in the treatment of gonococcal disease is discussed.
