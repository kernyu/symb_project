The human tumor-derived cell line HeLa S3 and nuclear and mitochondrial gene mutants derived from it are resistant to the aminoglycoside antibiotic, paromomycin (PAR). Other carcinoma-derived cells, SV40-transformed cells, and four human diploid fibroblast cell lines are all sensitive to PAR. Sensitivity is dependent on cell density, and at cell numbers greater than 400/cm2 sensitive cells will proliferate in PAR. The resistance to PAR is inherited in a dominant manner in cell-to-cell fusion hybrids, but is not transferred in cytoplast-to-cell fusions. PAR resistance is therefore encoded by a nuclear gene(s). Resistance to PAR is not caused by changes in the response of mitochondrial or cytoplasmic protein synthesis to PAR in vitro. The uptake of PAR is similar in resistant and sensitive cells, and dimethyl sulfoxide does not render resistant cells more sensitive. Thus, HeLa cell PAR resistance is unlike previously reported ribosomal mutations and may derive from differences in the intracellular metabolism of PAR.
