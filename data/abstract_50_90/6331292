The peritoneal macrophages of mice treated with lysozyme were studied by cytochemical assay. In single and repeated doses of 0.5-5 mg/kg lysozyme induced an increase in macrophage metabolism. This was evident from an increased activity of succinate dehydrogenase, NADP X N-DH and the enzymes catalyzing glycolysis typical of these cells (lactate dehydrogenase and alpha-glycerophosphate). The changes in the activity of the enzymatic systems were most pronounced in minute and less mature macrophages after repeated administrations of the drugs. In a dose of 50 mg/kg lysozyme somewhat decreased the activity of a number of the enzymes. In the doses optimal for the macrophage activity lysozyme had a low effect on the infection resistance and slightly increased the cephotaxim efficiency in experimental staphylococcal infection. This may be mainly due to the immunomodulating effect of lysozyme and its low effect on the large macrophages having the bactericidal effect.
