Age is not as important in predisposing to infections as are the associated problems peculiar to certain age groups. Factors such as the advanced age of the patients combined with the presence of chronic disease reduce their resistance to infection. This study comprises 212 elderly patients (aged 65-98 years) who were treated with 500-1000 mg/day ciprofloxacin for 1-18 days. Despite the high incidence of associated chronic diseases, microbiology showed that infections were eradicated in 88.5%. Clinical resolution occurred in 75.5% of patients and clinical failure occurred in 6.1%. Treatment was well tolerated, with clinical side-effects reported in only seven patients. Ciprofloxacin may be considered an effective and safe antimicrobial agent for the treatment of infections in the elderly.
