The replication region of a 28-kilobase-pair (kbp) cryptic plasmid from Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis biovar diacetylactis SSD207 was cloned in L. lactis subsp. lactis MG1614 by using the chloramphenicol resistance gene from the streptococcal plasmid pGB301 as a selectable marker. The resulting 8.1-kbp plasmid, designated pVS34, was characterized further with respect to host range, potential cloning sites, and location of replication gene(s). In addition to lactococci, pVS34 transformed Lactobacillus plantarum and, at a very low frequency, Staphylococcus aureus but not Escherichia coli or Bacillus subtilis. The 4.1-kbp ClaI fragment representing lactococcal DNA in pVS34 contained unique restriction sites for HindIII, EcoRI, XhoII, and HpaII, of which the last three could be used for molecular cloning. A region necessary for replication was located within a 2.5-kbp fragment flanked by the EcoRI and ClaI restriction sites. A 3.8-kbp EcoRI fragment derived from a nisin resistance plasmid, pSF01, was cloned into the EcoRI site of pVS34 to obtain a nisin-chloramphenicol double-resistance plasmid, pVS39. From this plasmid, the streptococcal chloramphenicol resistance region was subsequently eliminated. The resulting plasmid, pVS40, contains only lactococcal DNA. Potential uses for this type of a nisin resistance plasmid are discussed.
