B. subtilis strain 168 was transformed by means of staphylococcal plasmids responsible for resistance to penicillins and levomycetin, as well as for resistance to cadmium ions and for bacteriocinogenicity linked with resistance to cadmium ions. In the new host these plasmids affected the duration of the lag phase and the time of generation. The production of staphylococcal bacteriocin in B. subtilis was accompanied by the lysis of the cells.
