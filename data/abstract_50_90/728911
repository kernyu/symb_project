The properties of a nonviable, aqueous ether-extracted Brucela abortus preparation, Bru-Pel, are described. In addition to inducing a "virus-type" interferon response and protecting mice against challenge with otherwise lethal doses of Semliki Forest virus, Bru-Pel is demonstrated to have potent antitumor properties in mice. These antitumor effects appear to be mediated by an increase in nonspecific resistance similar to that seen with other experimental antitumor agents.
