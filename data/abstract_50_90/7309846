Five strains of an unidentified fluorescent Pseudomonas sp. which were capable of growth at 42 degrees C were isolated over a 3-year period and were examined and compared with chosen strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, P. fluorescens, and P. putida. The strains were examined in a range of biochemical and carbon substrate alkalinization tests. The outstanding properties of the unidentified fluorescent Pseudomonas sp. included monopolar arrangement of flagella, gelatin liquefaction, litmus milk peptonization, and growth on cetrimide and Salmonella-Shigella agars. All strains failed to produce pyocyanin, 2-ketogluconate, and nitrogen gas, failed to acidify mannitol and xylose, and failed to alkalinize acetamide and allantoin. Similarities to P. fluorescens and P. putida were reflected in their resistance to carbenicillin and susceptibility to kanamycin and tetracycline.
