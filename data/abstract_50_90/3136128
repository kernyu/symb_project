Leukotrienes C4 and D4 have been implicated as possible mediators of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction. To test this hypothesis, the relationship between pulmonary leukotriene (LT) synthesis in response to hypoxia and alterations in pulmonary hemodynamics was evaluated in pentobarbital sodium-anesthetized, neuromuscular-blocked, male, mongrel dogs. A reduction in the fraction of inspired O2 (FIO2) in vehicle-treated animals (n = 12) from 0.21 to 0.10 was associated with increases in LTC4 and LTD4 in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). After 30 min of continuous hypoxia, LTC4 and LTD4 increased from control values of 59.4 +/- 10.4 and 91.7 +/- 18.1 ng/lavage to 142.7 +/- 31.8 (P less than 0.05) and 156.3 +/- 25.3 (P less than 0.01) ng/lavage, respectively. Concomitantly, mean pulmonary arterial pressure (Ppa) and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) were increased over control by 67 +/- 7 (P less than 0.001) and 62 +/- 7% (P less than 0.001), respectively. In contrast, in animals treated with diethylcarbamazine (n = 5), a leukotriene A4 synthase inhibitor, identical reductions in FIO2 were not associated with increases in LTC4 and LTD4 in BALF, although at the same time period, Ppa and PVR were increased over control by 60 +/- 13 (P less than 0.05) and 112 +/- 31% (P less than 0.05), respectively. These results, therefore, do not support the contention that leukotrienes mediate hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction in dogs.
