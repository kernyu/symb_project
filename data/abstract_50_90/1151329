Eighty-one strains ofStaphylococcus aureus that appeared to be tetracycline resistant on the basis of a preliminary disc-diffusion test were examined fro resistance to tetracycline and to the semi-synthetic tetracycline, minocycline. Minimum inhibitory concentration (m.i.c.) values for both drugs were determined after induction of the strains by growth for 2 h in sub-inhibitory concentrations fo tetracycline. Forty-seven strain (58 percent) had m.i.c. values for minocycline of I2.5 MUg/ml or greater, and were considered to be minocycline resistant. An additional ten strains had m.i.c.r greater, and were considered to be minocycline resistant. An additional ten strains had m.i.c.values for minocycline of 3.I25 to 6-25 MUg/ml and were classified as low-level resistant strain. It appears, therefore, that a faily high proportion fo tetracycline-resistant strains isolated at the present time are resistant of concentrations of minocycline unattainbale in vivo with the recommended dosage forthis antibiotic (Fishk & Tunevall, 1969). Transductioal analysis of the genetic determinantswo types of resistance to high concentrations of tetracycline. Strains in the first categroy (A)were inducibly resistant to tetracycline but sensitive to minocycline; in these strains the resistance determinant was plasmid-borne. Strains in the second categroy (B) were resistant to both tetracycline and minocycline and had low induction ratios for tetracycline resistance; the genetic determinant for resistance in these strains was chromosomal. In addition, certain strains incategroy A were found to carry a chromosomal gene controlling low-level resistance to tetracycline and minocycline. This low-level resistance to tetracycline was masked in the presence of the tetracycline plasmide but could be demonstrated after loss of the plasmid. The results suggest that more than one mechanism of resistance to tetracyclines may exist in staphylococci.
