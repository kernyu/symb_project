Increasing resistance to antibiotics in meningeal pathogens has stimulated a search for new antimicrobial agents for the treatment of bacterial meningitis. Moxalactam penetrates well into infected cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and is highly active against most gram-negative bacteria. The clinical efficacy and safety of moxalactam in the treatment of childhood meningitis caused by Haemophilus influenzae (25 patients) or Neisseria meningitidis (five patients) was evaluated in a random, uncontrolled study. The penetration of the antibiotic into CSF was also evaluated in these patients and in another five children with bacterial meningitis. The clinical results were excellent, with 29 of 30 cases cured. The single adverse clinical reaction noted was the development of a wound hematoma in a postoperative patient; this problem may have been related to moxalactam therapy. The levels of moxalactam achieved in CSF greatly exceeded the minimal bactericidal concentrations for the infecting organisms. Moxalactam appears to be safe and effective as primary therapy for meningitis caused by H influenzae or N meningitidis.
