This report deals with the differential diagnosis between Mycobacterium marinum and M. kansasii. We found that the two species could be differentiated by using six main tests, namely, the nitrate reduction test, the arylsulfatase test, the ability to grow in the presence of 10.0 mug of amithiazone per ml, the ability to grow in the presence of 5.0 mug of kanamycin per ml, the temperature-ratio test, and the rate of growth on solid medium. In contrast to M. kansasii, considerable variation was observed among strains of M. marinum. However, the evidence obtained was not considered sufficient to justify the conclusion that more than one species was represented among the strains identified as M. marinum.
