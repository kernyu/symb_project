Effective antibacterial drugs have been available for nearly 50 years. After the introduction of each new such drug, whether chemically synthesized or a naturally occurring antibiotic, bacterial resistance to it has emerged. The genetic mechanisms by which bacteria have acquired resistance were quite unexpected; a new evolutionary pathways has been revealed. Although some antibiotic resistance has resulted from mutational changes in structural proteins--targets for the drugs' action--most has resulted from the acquisition of new, ready-made genes from an external source--that is, from another bacterium. Vectors of the resistance genes are plasmids--heritable DNA molecules that are transmissible between bacterial cells. Plasmids without antibiotic-resistance genes are common in all kinds of bacteria. Resistance plasmids have resulted from the insertion of new DNA sequences into previously existing plasmids. Thus, the spread of antibiotic resistance is at three levels: bacteria between people or animals; plasmids between bacteria; and transposable genes between plasmids.
