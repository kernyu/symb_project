The changes in wall structure of two penicillinase-negative strains of Bacillus licheniformis on addition of penicillin were studied. After addition of penicillin to give a concentration of 1 unit/ml, exponentially growing cells of strain 749 c/72 doubled once and then stopped. Strain 749c/72/IIIg was more resistant and continued growing, but synthesis appeared to become uncontrolled over the surface, producing localized wall thickening at the expense of elongation, and leading to distorted cells and growth in twisted and coiled chains, with an accompanying drop in growth rate. The continued growth can be explained by the existence of a less sensitive transpeptidase, but there is no obvious explanation for the uncontrolled synthesis. The effect of penicillin could be reversed by addition of penicillinase in both strains, although there appeared to be a persistent effect of penicillin which also produced distorted cells for a few generations and inhibited cell separation. The changes in wall structure produced by penicillin and penicillinase appeared all over the cell surface, suggesting that wall synthesis occurred all over the cell. Also a separate process for cross-wall synthesis is suggested since this appeared less sensitive than wall synthesis.
