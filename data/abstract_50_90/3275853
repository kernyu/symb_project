Mice were fed a cholesterol-rich diet and then subsequently infected with chloroquine-sensitive strains of either Plasmodium berghei or P. chabaudi. Chloroquine therapy, which was started 24 hours post-infection and continued for 3-4 days, was significantly less effective in cholesterol-fed animals compared to controls. The consequences of these findings to the resistance of P. falciparum in man to chloroquine, are discussed.
