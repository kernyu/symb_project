Analysis was done on macrophage chemotactic factor (MCF) produced in the culture supernatant of spleen cells from mice immunized with Listeria monocytogenes. MCF was produced by Thy-1+, Lyt-1+ lymphocytes. MCF activity was resistant against pH 2 treatment and heating at 56 degrees C for 30 min, but was abolished by digestion with trypsin. G-100 gel filtration chromatography revealed that the approximate molecular weight of MCF was 15,000. MCF-rich fraction obtained by gel filtration chromatography showed neither MAF activity nor interferon activity. MCF activity in MCF-rich fraction was not affected by treatment with anti-rIFN-gamma antibody. An injection of MCF-rich fraction into the peritoneal cavity of mice induced a significant degree of accumulation of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) in a very short time after injection and macrophages thereafter. Resistance against listerial infection was augmented at the site where macrophage accumulation was provoked by the injection with MCF-rich fraction. It was shown that MCF plays an important role by itself in the protection against listerial infection by the accelerated accumulation of macrophages.
