71 healthy oral, throat and nasal carriers of Staphylococcus aureus undergoing surgical removal of impacted mandibular third molars were assigned to the following regimens. 40 patients received dicloxacillin 500 mg orally 60 min before the operation and then 500 mg dicloxacillin 3 times daily for 7 days and 31 patients no antibiotic. Oropharyngeal and nasal cultures were obtained from each patient before, during and after the operation. Dicloxacillin reduced the carrier rates significantly. No increase in in vitro antibiotic resistance was observed in the staphylococcal isolates obtained after therapy. Dicloxacillin was well tolerated and toxicity was not encountered in any patient.
