It has been suggested that natural cytotoxic (NC) cell activity and tumor necrosis factor (TNF), the molecular mediator of NC activity, are capable of protecting individuals against the progression of incipient tumors or could be useful in cancer therapy regimens. Much of this speculation arises as a result of in vitro studies, on a variety of tumor cells, demonstrating the cytolytic and cytostatic properties of NC and TNF activities. Here, evidence is presented showing that certain mouse fibroblast cell lines, generally considered sensitive to NC and TNF lysis, are quite resistant to these lytic activities when cultured at high cell density. Although a soluble factor that renders these same target cells resistant to NC and TNF lysis has been described, no such factor is involved in this high density-induced resistance. Rather, it appears that cell to cell contact of the targets is critical. Moreover, the induced resistance to NC and TNF lysis does not result from loss of either NC recognition determinants or TNF receptors by the target cells, but is the consequence of increased expression of a protein synthesis-dependent resistance mechanism. These observations raise the issue of the in vivo phenotype of cells characterized in vitro as sensitive to NC and TNF lysis. It is entirely possible that certain cells which are considered sensitive to NC and TNF activities are, in fact, resistant to these cytolytic activities when growing as tumors (i.e., at high cell density). Should this be the so, NC and TNF cytolytic activities may not function in vivo or may function only via some indirect means.
