Considering 99.9% Killing after 24h of incubation, mean bactericidal activity of teicoplanin against 48 clinical isolates of Staphylococci resulted to be 67.7 micrograms/ml. Fortyfour out of 48 strains (91.7%) resulted tolerant. The high percentage of tolerant was dependent on survivors above the 0.1% allowed in several tube dilutions. Prolonged incubation consistently reduced this number. Only 37.5% of our strains remained tolerant after 48h of incubation. Bactericidal activity of teicoplanin was also significantly influenced by other technical factors. Human serum enhanced the killing of teicoplanin. For 9 strains of Staphylococcus aureus geometric mean MBC decreased from 49.9 muug/ml to 3.9 micrograms/ml (p less than 0.05); also actively growing bacteria demonstrated a higher killing rate, resulting in lower MBCs (mean 3.8 micrograms/ml). Micromethod technique was greatly influenced by the carryover phenomenon. The spot subculture technique is not accurate for bactericidal studies. A standardized technique for determining the minimal bactericidal activity is needed.
