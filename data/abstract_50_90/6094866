The authors have carried out the laboratory and clinical studies of sulbactam/cefoperazone (SBT/CPZ) and obtained the following results. The antibacterial activities of SBT/CPZ against the clinical isolates of S. aureus, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, E. aerogenes, S. marcescens, P. aeruginosa were measured by the plate dilution method with inoculum size of 10(6) cells/ml. The susceptibility distribution of S. aureus to SBT/CPZ ranged from 0.39 to 6.25 micrograms/ml, and the peak of distribution was 1.56 micrograms/ml. The peak of susceptibility distribution of K. pneumoniae was 0.20 microgram/ml, and the distribution of E. coli and E. aerogenes ranged from 0.10 to 12.5 micrograms/ml and that of S. marcescens, from 0.2 to 25 micrograms/ml. The growth of 80.8% of P. aeruginosa was inhibited at the concentration of 12.5 micrograms/ml. The distribution of E. cloacae ranged from 0.1 to 50 micrograms/ml. For pharmacokinetic study, SBT/CPZ was given in a single dose of 20 mg/kg by drip infusion for 1 hour in 2 children and 40 mg/kg by drip infusion for 1 hour in 1 children. With drip infusion of SBT/CPZ, the peak serum level were 17.8/43.9 micrograms/ml, 21.8/75.5 micrograms/ml on completion of the infusion, respectively. SBT/CPZ was effective in 14 cases out of 16 cases with clinical effect. No side effect was observed except for eosinophilia in 1 case.
