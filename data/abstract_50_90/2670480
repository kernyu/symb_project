A modified Rieckmann test was developed for assessing chloroquine sensitivity of Plasmodium vivax strains. This test envisages the evaluation of parasite growth with different concentrations of the drug and its comparison with controls, at the end of a 48-hour experimental period. Using this test, 16 strains were assessed for their chloroquine sensitivity. Twelve strains were found to be sensitive, and 4 were resistant to chloroquine.
