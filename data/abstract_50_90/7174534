The chromophores extracted from macromomycin (MCR) and auromomycin (AUR) with methanol had identical ultraviolet absorption spectra, antibacterial spectra and analytical profiles in high pressure liquid chromatography. The chromophore content of AUR was about 8 times higher than that of MCR. MCR reconstituted from the chromophore and protein fraction was identical with native MCR by Sephadex G-50 chromatography, ultraviolet absorption spectrum and antibacterial spectrum. The antibacterial activity of MCR and AUR was due to the chromophore; the protein moiety had no activity. However, the protein moiety enhanced the activity of the chromophore against Gram-positive bacteria, while it suppressed the activity against Gram-negative organisms. It also protected the chromophore from heat-inactivation.
