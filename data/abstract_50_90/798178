Thirty-six two-day old male turkey poults were divided into three groups and fed three levels of oxytetracycline; 0, 110 or 440 mg. per kg. of ration, respectively, for nine weeks. The poults were given an oral spectinomycin plus vitamin treatment at the hatchery but were not fed before the start of the experiment. Defecated feces from each group were sampled at weekly intervals and analyzed for bacteriological content, especially for members of the Enterobacteriaceae. Total aerobic counts of 3 x 10(8) and total anaerobic counts of 2 x 10(9) were obtained. The majority of the Enterobacteriaceae were Escherichia coli but some Klebsiella sp., the Bethesda-Ballerup group of paracolon bacteria and Arizona sp. were also isolated. Antibiograms of the enteric isolates indicated that an increase in multiple antibiotic resistance occurred when increased amounts of antibiotic were fed.
