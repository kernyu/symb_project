The specificity of integration of chloramphenicol resistance transposon (Tn9) into Vibrio El Tor chromosome was studied. As shown by the isolation of auxotrophs offerring various nitritional requirements, Tn9 displayed fairly low specificity in its interaction with the chromosome. When inserted into cholera vibrio chromosome, Tn9 induced secondary rearrangements of genetic material. Nutritional requirements were identified for the polyauxotrophic clones which resulted from the mutations in chromosome region adjacent to the insertion sites of Tn9 and Tn10. Based on these observations a preliminary map was constructed for certain regions of V. eltor chromosome.
