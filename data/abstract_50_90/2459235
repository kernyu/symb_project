Neuroblastoma cell lines can have very low MHC Ag expression. The cell lines are insensitive to allo-killing by primed CTL, but are sensitive to non-MHC-restricted cytotoxicity. IFN-gamma increased class I expression, but the cells remained insensitive to CTL. Susceptibility to nonrestricted effectors was preserved. Class I+ glioma cell lines behaved similarly. The CTL resistance was localized to the recognition phase. Neuroblastoma lines did not form conjugates with primed T cells, but were lysed if they were coupled to the effectors via lectins. The levels of class I expression, and resistance to CTL, were constant over a range of IFN doses. HLA-A,B,C structure and distribution were studied more intensively on one cell line, CHP-100. HLA-A2 and -A3 were present on greater than or equal to 99% of the cells, in a unimodal distribution. After IFN treatment, the levels were similar to B cell controls. In two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, the molecules co-migrated with those of B cell controls. The defect may thus be in accessory proteins that are necessary for T cell recognition or binding, rather than in the structure or distribution of the HLA-A,B,C proteins.
