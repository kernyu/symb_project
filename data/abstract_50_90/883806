The antimicrobial effect of benzylpenicillin in combination with bile acids on staphylococci was studied. It was shown that bile acids increased the bacteriostatic and bactericidal effects of the antibiotic. The highest potentiating effect was found with combination of benzylpenicillin and desoxycholic and choleic acids. When resistant strains of staphylococci were exposed to the combination of the bile acids and benzylpenicillin they became highly sensitive to antibiotic.
