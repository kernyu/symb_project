In a series of 68 operations for insertion or revision of cerebrospinal fluid shunts the incidence of infection was reduced from 20% in controls to 4.2% when systemic and intrathecal or intra-shunt gentamicin prophylaxis was employed. The only infection occurring in the latter group was due to an organism resistant to gentamicin. No reduction in infection rate was noted when povidone iodine was instilled into the wounds.
