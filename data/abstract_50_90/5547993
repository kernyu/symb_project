A genetic recombination system in Streptomyces bikiniensis var. zorbonensis is described. This strain produces a mixture of antibiotics including zorbamycin and zorbonomycin B and C. A genetic map has been constructed from data obtained from an analysis of haploid recombinants which shows linkage relationships of 17 marker loci. Determination of map location has been made for three different loci affecting antibiotic biosynthesis in this strain.
