A study of the efficiency and tolerance of sisomicin in 19 children with severe bacterial infections led to the following conclusions: -sisomicin was efficient, particularly in association with beta-lactamin; -the local and systemic tolerance was good. The susceptibility of various bacterial strains was studied. The half-life of sisomicin given intramuscularly was : 4,0 +/- 1,8 hours in the new-borns under 10 days and 2,0 +/- 0,3 hours in older infants, when creatininemia was below 10 mg/l. No accumulation was found. The recommended daily dose of sisomicin by intramuscular route is 3 to 6 mg/kg, i.e. 1 to 2 mg every 8 hours in infants an 1,5 to 3 mg every 12 hours in new-borns.
