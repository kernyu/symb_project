The authors studied 198 strains of mycobacteriae from different sources, but mainly from bronchial secretion and adenoid pus or poundings. Because the preponderance of peripheral adenoid tuberculosis, we might fear a focus of Mycobacterium bovis. But this study gives leave to state positively that Mycobacterium tuberculosis hominis is almost exclusively the responsible and consequent by that there is an human reservoir almost exclusive. On the other hand, study of primary and secondary resistances to anti-bacillary drugs leads to express some concern particularly vis a vis modern treatments utilized as a matter of routine.
