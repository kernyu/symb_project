The incidence of conjugative R plasmids in multiple drug-resistant strains of gram-negative bacteria isolated in 1973 from patients in a 700-bed general hospital in Tokyo and some properties of the R plasmids isolated are described. Conjugative R plasmids were found in 52 of the 96 strains (54%), from which 74 R plasmids were demonstrated. It is remarkable that the isolation frequency of R plasmids mediating quadruple- or five-drug resistance was rather low, and the complete pattern of multiple resistance of the original isolates was only rarely transferred by conjugation. These results revealed the existing state of the distribution of R plasmids among hospital strains with multiple drug-resistance.
