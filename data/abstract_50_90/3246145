The MRS test is a commercially available test for detection of methicillin resistance among Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), which was compared to standard techniques for efficacy and speed. Among 119 S. aureus strains tested (71 resistant to methicillin), it detected 90% of MRSA strains in 4 hr. The MRS test may have a role as a rapid screening test for MRSA in selected situations.
