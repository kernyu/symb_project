The in vitro activity of metronidazole, chloramphenicol, clindamycin, cefoxitin, and carbenicillin was tested by an agar dilution method against 228 strains of the Bacteroides fragilis group isolated from human intestinal microbiota during 1981 and 1982. All the strains were susceptible to metronidazole. Resistance rates for chloramphenicol, clindamycin, cefoxitin, and carbenicillin were 2, 37, 21, and 13%, respectively.
