22 cases of adult cerebral malaria were observed between July 1987 and June 1989, either associated or not: parasitemia 5%, consciousness disorders, acute renal failure, thrombocytopenia. Two patients died (9%). Increased frequency of attacks is underlined. They are due to chloroquino-resistant parasite strains, even polychemoresistant, occurred in French speaking Tropical Africa since 1985. Therapeutic strategy is described. The necessity to use increased doses of quinine has been admitted, correlatively underlining importance of strict monitoring of the patients because, in first instance, the risk of hypoglycemia (eased by injecting too quickly high doses of quinine) and of acute pulmonary oedema (eased by too quick perfusions and/or transfusions).
