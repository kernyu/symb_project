We have reviewed all 3577 nosocomial infections occurring at our institution over a 49-month period and found coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) associated with 297. Seventy-eight of 193 CNS tested for antibiotic sensitivity were multiple-drug resistant (MR-CNS). There were 19 well-documented serious postoperative CNS infections including nine ventricular, seven bloodstream and three peritoneal infections. Each was associated with an indwelling device and 11 of the infections involved MR-CNS. Antibiotic therapy with or without removal of the device resulted in cure of all patients. Air samples taken during various surgical procedures frequently were positive for CNS but rarely revealed MR-CNS. Our results cause concern regarding current antibiotic prophylaxis regimens.
