A variety of components provide salivary secretions with an array of potentially effective means of combating cariogenic challenges. These defense factors range from a laissez-faire mechanical cleansing to exquisitely controlled production of highly specific antibodies. In between the two extremes are antibacterial systems whose operating characteristics are only beginning to be understood. These systems are well worth our attention. They may be the key to our understanding of variations in individual susceptibility, and could provide valuable leads for development of anticaries agents.
