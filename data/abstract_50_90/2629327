The sensitivity to 4 aminoglycoside antibiotics (gentamicin, tobramycin, netilmycin and amicacin) and 5 cephalosporins (cefradine, cefamandol, cefotaxime, cefoperazone and ceftriaxone) was determined in 700 bacterial strains isolated from clinical materials in the years 1986-1987. The most frequent coexistent resistance was observed to gentamicin and tobramycin in S. aureus (30%), Klebsiella (30%), Proteus mirabilis (28%) and Enterobacter (23%). Resistance to 5 cephalosporins was found in Enterobacter (28%), Proteus spp (18%), Klebsiella (10%). Resistance to cefradine only was found in 13% of E. coli and 27% of Proteus mirabilis strains, and resistance to cefradine and cefamandol in 30% of Proteus ssp strains S. aureus strains were resistant to cefradine, cefotaxime, cefoperazone and ceftriaxone in 28% of cases. Multiple resistance was found in the strains of Enterobacter, Proteus, Pseudomonas and S. aureus which were isolated mainly in intense therapy, surgery and haematology departments. Among aminoglycosides netilmycin and amicacin were most active, among cefalosporins ceftriaxone was most effective against Gram-negative bacteria, and cefamandol against S. aureus.
