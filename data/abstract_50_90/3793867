The 45-kilobase tetracycline resistance plasmids pMAK175 and pUA466 from Campylobacter jejuni were examined using curing and mating experiments. However, these plasmids encoded neither cytotoxin production, as determined in Vero cells, nor enterotoxin activity, as determined in Chinese hamster ovary cells.
