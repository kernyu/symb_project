Bruceantin, purified from an Ethiopian plant used to treat dysentery, killed Entamoeba histolytica in vitro (IC50 [the concentration of drug which decreased the number of colonies to half that of controls] = 0.018 microgram/ml). Six related quassinoids of 17 tested were also amoebicidal. No relationship between quassinoid structure and amoebicidal activity was apparent.
