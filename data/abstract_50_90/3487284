The most common cause of ampicillin resistance in Haemophilus influenzae type b is production of TEM-1 beta-lactamase; however, a novel enzyme with a similar substrate profile but a quite different isoelectric point has also been described. This beta-lactamase, designated ROB-1, has not been found previously in any other organism. In a survey of 46 ampicillin-resistant H. influenzae type b isolates, we found a second human isolate that produces ROB-1 and discovered that ampicillin-resistant isolates of the porcine pathogen Haemophilus pleuropneumoniae also produced ROB-1. In both Haemophilus species ROB-1 production was determined by plasmids that had considerable DNA sequence homology. However, the ROB-1 and TEM-1 beta-lactamase genes were not related. Our findings suggest that this form of ampicillin resistance has an animal reservoir and that conditions fostering its prevalence in animal strains may play a role in the spread of resistance to human pathogens.
