The origin of replication of Haemophilus ducreyi and Neisseria gonorrhoeae ampicillin resistance plasmids was located by cloning BamHI restriction fragments into vector plasmid pAT153 and a derivative plasmid, pAT2. Selection was made for plasmid maintenance in a polA mutant. Direction of replication was determined by in vitro replication of plasmid DNA in the presence of radiolabeled deoxynucleotide.
