We cloned and sequenced a 2.35-kilobase EcoRI fragment of genomic DNA from a local freshwater fish (Perca fluviatilis) that strongly hybridized to probes derived from the murine influenza virus resistance gene Mx. The cloned fish DNA contained blocks of sequences related to Mx gene exons 3 to 8, which appeared to represent exons of a bona fide fish gene because they were separated by intron sequences flanked by consensus splice acceptor and donor sites. Injection of double-stranded RNA into the peritoneal cavity of trouts resulted in 5- to 10-fold elevated levels of two liver mRNAs of about 2.0 to 2.5 kilobases in length that hybridized to the cloned genomic DNA. High sequence similarity between this fish gene and the murine Mx gene, identical exon lengths, and similar inducibilities in vivo by double-stranded RNA indicate that we isolated a fragment of a fish Mx gene.
