Altered regulation of synthesis of acetohydroxy acid synthetase (AHAS) was previously reported in a mutant of Escherichia coli strain K-12. The mutant strain, growing in minimal medium, exhibits a partial growth limiatation and derepression of AHAS, owing to deficient synthesis of isoleucine. The genetic lesion (ilvE503) causing the isoleucine limitation was shown to cause derepression of a valine-sensitive AHAS activity. The derepression effect of the ilvE503 mutation upon synthesis of AHAS was conclusively demonstrated by introducing both the ilvE503 allele and an altered AHAS (ilv-521) into the same cell. Evidence is presented that suggests the presence of multiple genetic regions for synthesis and control of the valine-sensitive AHAS activity.
