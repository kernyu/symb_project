This study is a continuation of the investgation of the influence of endogenous and exogenous interferon on influenza infection. Influenza B virus strains, both laboratory and fresh isolates, were found to be poor interferon inducers in contrast to influenza A virus strains. The study also showed that influenza B virus strains not only induced endogenous interferon poorly but were also resistant to exogenous interferon. This evidence points to marked differences of the investigated influenza B virus strains not only induced endogenous interferon poorly but were also resistant to exogenous interferon. This evidence points to marked differences of the investigated influenza B virus strains from influenza A virus strains which further indicates their peculiar nature.
