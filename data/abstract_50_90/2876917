The amino acid substitutions in subunit 6 of the mitochondrial ATPase complex have been determined for 4 oligomycin resistant mutants of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The data were obtained for each mutant by nucleotide sequence analysis of the mitochondrial oli2 gene. Amino acid substitutions conferring oligomycin resistance in subunit 6 are located in two conserved regions that are thought to form domains which span the inner mitochondrial membrane. The disposition of these amino acid substitutions is consistent with the view that these two membrane-spanning domains interact structurally and functionally with the DCCD-binding proteolipid subunit 9 in the Fo-sector.
