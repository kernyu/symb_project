Morphological and physiological characterization of 12 Aeromonas strains isolated from clinical specimens demonstrated several important diagnostic features. These included polar arrangement of the flagella; production of oxidase, deoxyribonuclease, amylase, gelatinase, and lipase; lack of ornithine decarboxylase; and sensitivity to polymyxin. Awareness of these features should result in more frequent differentiation of aeromonads from the physiologically similar members of the genus Plesiomonas and the late- or non-lactose-fermenting species of Enterobacteriaceae.
