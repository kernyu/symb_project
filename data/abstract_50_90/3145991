We investigated in vitro synergistic activity of astromicin (ASTM) combined with beta-lactam antibiotics (cefsulodin (CFS), cefoperazone (CPZ), ceftazidime (CAZ), piperacillin (PIPC) and fosfomycin (FOM) against fresh clinical isolated Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which consisted of 13 CFS sensitive (MIC less than or equal to 3.13 micrograms/ml) and 19 CFS resistant (MIC greater than or equal to 400 micrograms/ml) strains according to the FIC index. Against CFS-sensitive P. aeruginosa, ASTM showed good synergistic activities when combined with PIPC (54%), CAZ (38%), CPZ (23%) and CFS (8%). Against CFS-resistant P. aeruginosa, ASTM also showed high synergistic activities when combined with CAZ (63%), CPZ (47%), PIPC (37%) and CFS (11%). Among the CFS-resistant P. aeruginosa, one clinical isolate showed a high sensitivity (MIC0.78 micrograms/ml) against ASTM alone.
