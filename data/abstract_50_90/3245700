The susceptibilities to 20 antimicrobial agents of Bordetella bronchiseptica variants in C mode and degraded phases were compared with those of their parents in X mode. Increases in MICs of 4- to 32-fold were observed for ampicillin, carbenicillin, erythromycin, novobiocin, rifampin, chloramphenicol, nalidixic acid, and oxolinic acid.
