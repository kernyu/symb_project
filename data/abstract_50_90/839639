A sixty-three years old female patient with subacute bacterial endocarditis was treated with clindamycin-2-phosphate parenterally, because she had a history of hypersensitive reaction to penicillins. She had received erythromycin, cephaloridine and cephalexin previously, but had no bacteriological response. When clindamycin-2-phosphate was given intramuscularly, the bacteremia disappeared for the first time. However, after the cessation of this treatment Streptococcus viridans grew in her blood again. It was suggested that this drug was bacteriostatic rather than bactericidal. During this therapy, local tenderness was noticed at the injected sites and a transient maculopapular rash developed which resolved in a few days.
