Cannon, Frances D. (The Mary Imogene Bassett Hospital, Cooperstown, N.Y.), and Clinton V. Z. Hawn. Phosphatase activity of Staphylococcus aureus: correlation of enzyme production with resistance to penicillin and phage pattern. J. Bacteriol. 86:1052-1056. 1963.-A simplified method for the determination of the phosphatase activity in different strains of staphylococci is described. The relationship between phosphatase production and penicillin resistance was studied and found inconstant. A close relationship between phosphatase production and phage group and type was observed.
