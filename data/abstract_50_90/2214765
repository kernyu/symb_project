Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry has revealed the existence of a novel lanosterol-like sterol which is produced by fungi in response to treatment with azole drugs. The significance of this finding may be related to the changes in fungal sterol synthesis as a consequence to prolonged exposure to azoles and consequent development of resistance to these agents.
