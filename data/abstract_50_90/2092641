Features of incorporation of cefazolin, ampicillin, kanamycin and gentamicin into erythrocytic shadows in patients with abdominal diseases and apparently healthy persons during hypoosmotic hemolysis were studied. The highest percentage of kanamycin and gentamicin incorporation into the erythrocytic shadows was observed. The parameter of the antibiotic incorporation from the incubation fluid into the erythrocytic shadows depended on the antibiotic type and dose. Rather significant resistance of the erythrocytic carriers with incorporated gentamicin to possible desorption and excretion of the antibiotic from the shadows into the blood flow was revealed which made their use possible for target release of antibiotics in the liver.
