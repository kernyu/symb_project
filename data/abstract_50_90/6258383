Forty-six clinical isolates of enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) collected in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, 1977--1978, were tested for susceptibility to 12 different antibiotics and beta-lactamase-production. Special reference was made to mecillinam and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMZ) that were recently shown to be effective in the treatment of severe gastroenteritis caused by EPEC. Twenty-nine of the strains were of serotype 0111:B4. Thirty of the strains were resistant to 4 antibiotics or more, most of these strains belonging to serotype 0111:B4. For mecillinam, 19 strains had minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) less than or equal to 0.2 microgram/ml, 27 strains had MIC 0.8--3.2 microgram/ml. Regarding TMP-SMZ, 41 strains had MIC less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml, 5 strains had 2--4 microgram/ml. No strain was resistant to gentamicin or nalidixic acid. Increased production of beta-lactamase was correlated to ampicillin resistance.
