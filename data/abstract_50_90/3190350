Nine hundred and fourty coagulase-positive and coagulase-negative strains of staphylococci isolated from the skin surface of the mammary glands of 94 pregnant women were tested by the disc agar diffusion method for their sensitivity to five antibiotics. The highest number of the isolates were sensitive to erythromycin and lincomycin (87.7 and 89.7 per cent, respectively). The highest number of moderately resistant strains were detected with respect to methicillin. 19 out of 42 cultures of Staph. aureus were resistant to benzylpenicillin and 24 cultures were resistant to tetracycline. Among staphylococci 130 strains or 13.8 per cent were polyresistant.
