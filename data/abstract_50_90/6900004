In a clinical study 20 elderly patients with severe respiratory tract infections and cystopyelonephritis resp. were treated with the penicillin combination product Optocillin. In each case the infectious organism was isolated. The infections were exclusively mixed infections involving a high proportion of staphylococci and gramnegative problem organism. Most of the isolated organisms were sensitive to the antibiotic component of Optocillin. The preparation was well tolerated. Considering the severity and chronic nature of the cases under investigation the clinical effect is regarded as very good.
