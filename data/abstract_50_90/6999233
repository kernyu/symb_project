A medium was investigated for transportation of Mycoplasma pulmonis pure cultures and swabs from animals suspected of having Mycoplasma pulmonis infections. The medium was developed because many culture specimens from animals carry an abundance of contaiminating bacteria masking in vitro growth of Mycoplasma pulmonis. Commonly occurring contaminants were identified, and their antibiotic sensitivities were quantified. The combination of carbenicillin, tribrissen and polymixin B was found to inhibit contaminating bacteria and allow Mycoplasma pulmonis to grow in the transport medium. Mycoplasma pulmonis survived under a wide range of temperatures for extended periods of time in the transport medium. Actual shipment of the medium containing Mycoplasma pulmonis demonstrated its value as a transport medium. The transport medium not only protected Mycoplasma pulmonis in transit but also was selective in promoting its growth in vitro.
