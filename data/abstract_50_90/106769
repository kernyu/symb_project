The study of 40 clinical strains of Ps. aeruginosa isolated from the wound surfaces of the patients showed that all the isolates were resistant to one or several antibiotics. The number of the strains resistant to 5, 4, 3, 2 or 1 drug was 5, 22.5, 25. 30 or 17.5 per cent respectively. Fifteen strains carried resistance plasmids capable of conjugative transfer. Eleven out of 21 plasmids controlled resistance to chloramphenicol, 7 plasmids controlled resistance to streptomycin and sulfanylamides, 1 plasmid controlled resistance to streptomycin and chloramphenicol. The presence of two types of the plasmids controlling resistance to chloramphenicol and streptomycin + sulfanylamides respectively was found. All the plasmids proved to be capable of conjugative transfer between the strains of Ps. aeruginosa ML (PAO). The frequency of the plasmid conjugative transfer in such crosses ranged from 10(-6) to 10(-3). Most of the plasmids belonged to the incompatibility groups P-2 and P-7. One plasmid belonged to the incompatibility group P-5. It should be noted that about a half of the plasmids (11 out of 21) belonged to the incompatibility group P-7 which up to the present time was conditional, since was represented by a single plasmid Rms 148.
