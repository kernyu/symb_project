The efficacy and safety of imipenem/cilastatin was evaluated in a multicenter study. For 49 of the 78 patients with 79 infections entered into the study, the clinical and bacteriologic efficacy of therapy could be evaluated. Toxicity data were analyzed for all 79 infections. Overall, 35 of 49 infections were cured or improved: 10 of 11 cases of pneumonia; 8 of 15 cases of pyelonephritis; 4 of 5 cases of osteomyelitis; 3 of 4 intravascular infections; 6 of 9 soft tissue infections; and 4 of 5 miscellaneous infections. There were 13 bacteriologic failures; superinfections with resistant organisms (i.e., Candida albicans, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Pseudomonas maltophilia) occurred in three patients; reinfection with sensitive pathogens complicated one urinary tract infection; relapses developed of five urinary tract infections and of one case of endarteritis; and bacteriologic persistence occurred in three soft tissue infections. Infections with Pseudomonas aeruginosa were the most difficult to treat. In only six of 11 P. aeruginosa infections was both bacteriologic and clinical cure achieved. Adverse effects were minimal; no serious hematologic or hepatic toxicity and no adverse renal effects were noted.
