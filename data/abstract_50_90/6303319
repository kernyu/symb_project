A nonproteinaceous, antimycin A insensitive ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase activity is detected in and purified from chromatophores of Rhodopseudomonas sphaeroides, R-26. This activity is about 5 times the antimycin A sensitive reductase activity in chromatophores and the two are not interconvertable. The purification involved chloroform:methanol (2:1), and hexane extractions and florisil column chromatography. The purified preparation contains some bacteriochlorophyll-like pigments and phospholipids, and is stable in organic solvent. It catalyzes the oxidation of ubiquinol by cytochrome c with substrate specificity and pH optimum.
