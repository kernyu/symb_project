The in vitro activity of teicoplanin was compared with that of vancomycin against fecal isolates of Clostridium difficile. All strains were susceptible to both antibiotics, but teicoplanin was fourfold more active than vancomycin. Cholestyramine was found to bind teicoplanin almost completely, reducing its activity to nondetectable levels.
