Disease caused by goiter is marked by changes in cellular and humoral unspecific resistance before and after operation, which at times is of decisive importance in the course of the postoperative period. Natural resistance is inhibited, to a greater measure, in patients with a long history of the disease and in those with diffuse toxic goiter. The work deals with the study of natural resistance in 98 patients with goiter before and after the operation in dynamics. The immunostimulator lysozyme was used for a more favourable course of the postoperative period. This promoted increase of the organism's natural resistance. which had a favourable effect on the course of the postoperative period.
