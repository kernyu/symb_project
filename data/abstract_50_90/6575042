In a comparative study of caries-resistant and -susceptible adults, no significant differences were found in the concentrations of lactoperoxidase, thiocyanate, and pre-formed hypothiocyanite in parotid and submandibular saliva, or in hypothiocyanite formed in expectorated saliva over a 60-minute period. The concentrations per se of these components are not critical determinants of caries resistance or susceptibility. Thiocyanate concentration was higher in both unstimulated parotid and submandibular saliva than in the respective stimulated secretions. At comparable flow rates, parotid values were higher than submandibular.
