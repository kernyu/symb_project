In vitro activity of piperacillin (PIPC) against 150 recent clinical isolates from obstetric and gynecologic infections was performed in comparison with sulbenicillin (SBPC), cefmetazole (CMZ), cefotiam (CTM) and cefsulodin (CFS). At 6.25 micrograms/ml PIPC inhibited 93% of S. epidermidis, 86% of S. faecalis, 67% of E. coli and 80% of Klebsiella. At 0.2 microgram/ml PIPC inhibited 100% of Peptococcus, 73% of Peptostreptococcus and 100% of B. melaninogenicus group. At 3.13 micrograms/ml PIPC inhibited 71% of B. fragilis 9 strains, B. distasonis 3 strains, B. thetaiotaomicron 1 strain, B. ovatus 1 strain. PIPC was constantly more active than SBPC, and it was especially more active against S. faecalis, Peptococcus, Peptostreptococcus and B. melaninogenicus group than other antibiotics. These findings show that PIPC is a broad spectrum penicillin against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms including anaerobic organisms. PIPC was administered to 5 patients intravenously and all cases proved to be effective. No side effects and no abnormalities in laboratory findings were observed. These results suggest that PIPC may be highly effective in the treatment of bacterial infections.
