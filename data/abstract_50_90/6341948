The results of a multicenter collaborative study on the antibiotic susceptibility of H. influenzae and H. parainfluenzae are showed. 4.5% of H. influenzae strains were beta-lactamase producing strains, they were isolated from sputum, CSF (7.5%), epiglottitis (20%); 3.5% and 0.2% of the strains were resistant to tetracycline and chloramphenicol respectively. The resistant strains belonged to the various biotypes and serotypes. 11% of H. parainfluenzae strains were beta-lactamase producing strains and 7% were resistant to tetracycline.
