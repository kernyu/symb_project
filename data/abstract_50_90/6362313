The effect of miconazole in fungistatic concentration on an ergosterol-competent Candida albicans strain and its ergosterol-nonproducing mutant was investigated by scanning and transmission electron microscopy. The ergosterol-less mutant showed pronounced alterations by scanning electron microscopy. The increased sensitivity to miconazole of the ergosterol-less mutant was attributed to an altered plasma membrane composition and rigidity.
