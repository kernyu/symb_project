Electrophoresis of outer membrane proteins in three ciprofloxacin-resistant strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated during therapy and their in vitro revertants indicated that diminution or loss of a 31- to 32-kilodalton outer membrane protein correlated with resistance in two of the three isolates. Resistance was unstable and caused no cross-resistance with other antibiotics.
