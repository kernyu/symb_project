The in vitro activity of LY 264826, a new glycopeptide antibiotic, was compared with that of vancomycin against 100 strains each of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Clostridium difficile. LY 264826 was more active, by weight, than vancomycin against the isolates tested. The human serum protein binding of LY 264826 was 15.3% (range, 9.8 to 21.8%).
