A new salvage treatment protocol consisting of VP-16, cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C), methotrexate (MTX) and L-asparaginase, known as VAMA, was administered to twelve patients with relapsed or resistant non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. All twelve patients were in advanced stage with aggressive histologic type. Four of eight patients whose tumor cells had been immunologically determined, had T-cell phenotype. Three complete and five partial responses were obtained, for an overall response rate of 67%. It is of particular interest that all four patients with T-cell phenotype responded(CR; 3 cases, PR; 1 case), and a CR duration over 31 months has been achieved in a case of T-lymphoblastic lymphoma. Severe myelosuppression was the major toxic effect, but it was generally well-tolerated with supportive therapy. These results indicate that VAMA salvage regimen can play an important role in the treatment of relapsed or resistant non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
