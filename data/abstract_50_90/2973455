Employing osmotically shocked lysate of a spectinomycin resistant strain of Escherichia coli, trospectomycin, a new alkylspectinomycin, was adenylylated in the presence of adenosine 5'-triphosphate and magnesium ion. A highly resistant strain of E. coli was obtained by transforming a laboratory strain with a newly constructed plasmid consisting of pBR322 and a determinant for spectinomycin resistance originally found on a low copy number plasmid in E. coli strain NR79. The biologically inactive adenylylated trospectomycin was found to be trospectomycin 6-(5'-adenylate).
