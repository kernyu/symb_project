The formation of complexes of RNA polymerases from E. coli W12 and its rpoB409 rifampicin resistant mutant with A1 and D promoters of T7 delta D111 DNA was studied by an abortive RNA synthesis technique. The mutation was shown to affect RNA synthesis initiation at these two promotors differentially so that the efficiency of D promotor utilization is enhanced but the use of A1 promotor is unchanged. The mutation does not interfere with the affinity of the enzyme for both initiating substrates. The results show that the change in RNA polymerase beta-subunit structure has a differential effect on the enzyme interaction with different promotors. The necessity of a classificatory approach to structure-functional analysis of promotors was proposed.
