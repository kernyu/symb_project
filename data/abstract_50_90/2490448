Streptococcus pneumoniae is a common pathogen in man. The incidence of endocarditis caused by this organism has diminished in the last decades, and now it is an exceptional condition. Three patients with pneumococcal endocarditis are reported. Their clinical and epidemiological features are reviewed and compared with previous literature. One of the instances was due to a strain with high resistance to penicillin; vancomycin was a valid alternative therapy.
