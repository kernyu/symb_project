Two bacteriophages for Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus were isolated. One of the phages (VL-1) was isolated on a host-independent Bdellovibrio strain, and the other (VL-2) was isolated on a host-dependent strain. Both phages grew on host-dependent as well as on host-independent Bdellovibrio strains. The development of the phages in host-dependent bdellovibrios occurred only when the phage-infected bdellovibrios parasitized cells of other bacteria. In the absence of other bacteria, the phages adsorbed to the bdellovibrios and killed them and in the process lost their own plaque-forming ability.
