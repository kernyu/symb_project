One hundred and eighty five strains of Gram-positive cocci were tested for susceptibility to 16 antibiotics, including some newer drugs, by agar dilution technique. Of these, 100 strains (50 each isolated in Poland and Germany) were Staphylococcus aureus, 55 Streptococcus pyogenes, and 30 Diplococcus pneumoniae. Previous investigations of streptococci and pneumococci isolated in Poland and Federal Republic of Grmany, revealed no differences in antibiotic-susceptibility patterns in both countries, which was not the case with staphylococci. Present study demonstrates further evidence for existence of differences in antibiotic-sensitivity of staphylococci, depending of their geographical origin, and presents actual state of susceptibility to antibiotics of Streptococcus pyogenes and Diplococcus pneumoniae.
