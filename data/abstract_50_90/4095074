The effect was studied of introducing about equal numbers of decoquinate-sensitive or decoquinate-resistant Eimeria tenella oocysts into a floor pen of susceptible unmedicated chickens. "Sentinel" birds introduced 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 weeks later were used to recover populations of E. tenella oocysts. In drug sensitivity tests, populations of oocysts harvested at 4 weeks were partially resistant to decoquinate medication. Oocysts obtained after 5 and 6 weeks were highly sensitive to decoquinate medication. The results indicate that drug-sensitive E. tenella parasites are more likely to dominate in absence of medication.
