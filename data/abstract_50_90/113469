Combinations of penicillin with various aminoglycosidic aminocyclitols were tested against a collection of clinical isolates of Streptococcus faecium in vitro and were used to treat endocarditis caused by S. faecium in the rabbit model. S. faecium proved more resistant to penicillin than Streptococcus faecalis. Even more striking, however, was the resistance to in vitro synergism by combinations of penicillin and various aminoglycosides. At clinically achievable concentrations, penicillin-gentamicin was the only combination that was synergistic against all strains that were tested. Combinations of penicillin and streptomycin and penicillin and amikacin were synergistic only against those strains that were not highly resistant to streptomycin and kanamycin, respectively. Combinations of penicillin with kanamycin, tobramycin, sisomicin, or netilmicin failed to produce synergism against any of these strains. The possible clinical significance of these findings was verified by use of the rabbit model of endocarditis. Combinations of penicillin with gentamicin or streptomycin were synergistic in the therapy of endocarditis that was produced by a strain of S. faecium that did not have a high level of resistance to aminoglycosides. However, the combination of penicillin and netilmicin was no more effective than penicillin alone.
