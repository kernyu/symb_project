The transfer of high molecular weight (HMW) DNA isolated from Syrian hamster actinomycin D-resistant cells (C12TSV5/R) to sensitive A9 mouse cells, resulted in the growth in selective medium of transferent clones A9 ActR C11, C12 and C13). The resistant mouse cells have presumably acquired a gene(s) conferring actinomycin D resistance and express a 140-150 K surface glycoprotein, apparently involved in the drug resistance.
