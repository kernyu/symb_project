The rate of adaptation of Escherichia coli K-12 NF930 spoT1 cells with elevated intracellular level of ppGpp to various minimal media was studied. It has been found that the rate of adaptation of spoT cells, like that of parent and rel strains, depends mainly on the rate of derepression of the ilv operon. The maximal rate of the ilv operon derepression was observed when an optimal concentration of ppGpp was maintained in cells. Derepression of the ilv operon is sharply delayed when the level of ppGpp is elevated or reduced. Mutations altering the translation system do not change the rate of adaptation of spoT cells. Rifampicin resistance mutations which altered the structure of RNA polymerase change the rate of adaptation of spoT cells to minimal media, especially to those containing serine at high concentrations. The possible role of serine in the regulation of ppGpp degradation system is discussed.
