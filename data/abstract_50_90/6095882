150 Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains, isolated from pathological samples (urine, faeces, sputum, etc.) of affections developed in cancerous patients have been studied. In vitro, with two different inocula, activities of some cephalosporins--ceftazidime, cefotaxime, cefoperazone--have been compared with those of gentamicin, carbenicillin and tobramycin. Ceftazidime, among the antibiotics tested, has been the most active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains.
