A 16-year old girl with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (8 years' duration) developed tropic malaria 7 weeks after her return from Kenya despite a longtime prophylaxis using pyrimethamine and sulfadoxine (Fansidar). The disease was detected during an episode of ketoacidosis which proved exceptionally difficult to manage. Adequate chloroquine therapy resulted in temporary recovery. A recurrence of malaria four weeks later was successfully treated with quinine and doxycycline. Intraleucocytary parasites were found during both these episodes. Already prior to antimalarial drug therapy the girls' preexisting retinopathy was found to have deteriorated.
