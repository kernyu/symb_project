Out of 110 cultures of Plasmodium falciparum obtained from infected patients in Natal 18 were found to be resistant to chloroquine by in vitro tests: 2 cultures showed schizont development in wells containing 24 pmol chloroquine; in 16 schizont development was present in culture wells containing 48 pmol chloroquine. Seventy-two patients with P. falciparum malaria who apparently did not respond to adequate oral chloroquine therapy were investigated. All responded to one or more treatments with pyrimethamine/sulphadoxine (Fansidar; Roche). It would seem that all the patients were infected in areas not controlled by the South African health authorities.
