The new fluorinated quinolones norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin and pefloxacin were evaluated in urinary infections. Bacteriological cure rates in both uncomplicated and complicated urinary tract infections ranged from 85% to 99%. Clinical cure rates were often lower due to the underlying conditions in the urinary tract. Patients with neurological bladder disease were cured in a relatively high percentage of their Pseudomonas infection after three months treatment with norfloxacin. Pharmacokinetics of ciprofloxacin in prostatic tissue and fluid will probably offer an advance in the treatment of chronic urinary infections due to an infectious prostatic focus. Definitely drug related side effects (of gastro-intestinal, neurological or allergic nature) were mild in most cases. The new 4-quinolones should be followed with interest concerning their activity in urological infections in general as well as specifically. The minor influence on the natural human flora and the possibility to decrease plasmid-mediated resistance are of major importance.
