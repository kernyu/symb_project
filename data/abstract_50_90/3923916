Antibiotic sensitivity to 8 staphylococcal strains was determined in artificial associations of bacteria and viruses before and after contact with adenoviruses of serotypes 2 and 7 under appropriate control. It was shown that after contact with the adenoviruses the antibiotic sensitivity of the staphylococci usually increased and they showed significant strain specificity. An attempt was made to explain the causes and mechanisms of the phenomena on the basis of the experimental and literature data.
