Incidence of cephalosporin-resistant staphylococcal infections is increasing recently. We tried to find out the possible first choice antibiotic for these infections. We estimated minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of each one of the broad spectrum antibiotics with different mode of actions as well as representative drugs of penicillins and cephalosporins against strains of Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus aureus. Trend of antibiotic susceptibility of S. epidermidis was found to be as same as that of S. aureus. MIC of minocycline was found to be the lowest in the drugs tested, and there found no resistant strains. MIC of erythromycin was next low but more than a half strains were found to be resistant to this drug. Some of the strains were thought to be treated with amikacin or sulfonamides by the MIC against them, but there also found many resistant strains. Therefore, use of these drugs should be decided after sensitivity test of the causative bacteria. Most of the strains were found not to be treated with beta-lactam antibiotics. In conclusion, minocycline could be the only one first choice drug for staphylococcal infections before antibiotic susceptibility test of the causative strains in the present moment.
