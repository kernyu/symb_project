Lymph node aspergillosis in an otherwise healthy patient receiving neither antibiotic corticosteroid or immunodepressive drug treatment is an uncommon event. In addition the case reported revealed no deficiency in humoral or cellular immunity. The possibility that aspergillosis may occur in cases without identifiable immunodeficiency is therefore put forward.
