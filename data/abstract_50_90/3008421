Fv-4r is a dominant resistance gene which controls resistance of mice to exogenous infection with ecotropic murine leukemia viruses. Cell lines with various degrees of resistance to ecotropic Friend murine leukemia virus infection were established from BALB/c-Fv-4wr mice which are partially congenic with BALB/c. The degree of resistance of these cell lines correlated well to the amount of glycoprotein with mol wt 80 K on cell surface. The resistance of cells was reduced by the treatment of glycosylation inhibitors, tunicamycin and 2-deoxy-D-glucose. The results indicate that the Fv-4 resistance is ascribed to the unique glycoprotein on cell surface.
