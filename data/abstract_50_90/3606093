We describe our experience with the isolation of salmonellae from sewage sludge from four treatment plants in different geographic areas of Ohio. Over 3 years, we isolated salmonellae 50 times from 311 sludge samples. Most isolations were made after enrichment in Selenite broth (BBL Microbiology Systems, Cockeysville, Md.). The largest proportion of isolations came from the plant serving the population of Columbus, a large metropolitan area. A significantly greater number of isolations from this plant were made during the first quarter of the year. Twenty-one different serotypes were isolated, along with five untypable strains. The most frequently isolated serotype was Salmonella infantis. Five of the strains were multiply resistant to antibiotics. We also describe the prevalence of antibodies to salmonellae in members of the families residing on the farms in the study. It was found that antibodies to group C salmonellae predominated.
