In a prospective open randomized trial pefloxacin (400 mg, iv, 8-hourly) and imipenem (1 g, iv, 8-hourly) were given for 5-30 days to 35 and 36 ICU patients, respectively, suffering from bronchopneumonia (54) or purulent bronchitis (17). All were spiking high fevers (greater than or equal to 39 degrees C) while 25 and 26 patients in the two groups were under mechanical ventilation. Underlying predisposing disorders, mainly chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, ischaemic heart disease, neurological diseases and traumatic lung injuries, were encountered in almost all. In appropriate bronchial secretion cultures, multiresistant Acinetobacter anitratus (40), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (25), various Enterobacteriaceae (17) and Staphylococcus aureus (6) were isolated. A successful clinical response, as proved by elimination of abnormal lung x-ray findings, temperature normalization and decreases in oxygen requirements, permitting weaning from mechanical ventilation and/or removal of nasotracheal intubation, was observed in 23 patients given pefloxacin (65.7%) and 19 patients given imipenem (52.8%). The differences in clinical outcome did not reach statistical significance. During therapy pathogens persisted in 9 (25.7%) patients given pefloxacin versus 18 (50%) given imipenem (P less than 0.05), while persisters developed resistance to pefloxacin and imipenem in seven and 12 patients, respectively (P less than 0.05). Tolerance was excellent for both antimicrobials. In the therapy of lung infections in ICU patients, pefloxacin when compared to imipenem was associated with more promising results, lower numbers of persisting pathogens and a lower incidence of resistance development.
