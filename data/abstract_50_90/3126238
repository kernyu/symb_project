T cell-dependent, cell-mediated immune mechanisms have been shown to contribute to resistance against malaria. Because the identity of plasmodial Ag responsible for the activation of these protective immune responses remains unknown, a major step in isolating these potential immunizing agents will be the development of adequate screening procedures designed to identify important T cell Ag. This study focused on the isolation of protective T cell clones that may play a pivotal role in this process. A T cell clone designated CTR2.1 and two subclones derived from it adoptively transferred protection to athymic nude mice infected with Plasmodium chabaudi adami, a murine malarial parasite known to be recognized by protective thymus-dependent immune mechanisms. The protective T cell clone displayed a L3T4+, Lyt-2- surface phenotype and secreted both IFN-gamma and IL-2 after stimulation with solubilized parasites in vitro. This is the first report of results demonstrating a cloned T cell line capable of providing adoptive protection against malaria in vivo. More importantly, CTR2.1 and other protective T cell clones may provide for the identification of plasmodial antigenic epitopes recognized by important cell-mediated immune mechanisms during acute malarial infection.
