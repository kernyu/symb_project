We evaluated the in-vitro activity of 16 antibiotics against 22 clinical isolates of Campylobacter fetus. The interaction of these antibiotics was also tested by chequer-board titration and time-kill assay. Eight antibiotic combinations were evaluated. Antagonism was not found with any of the combinations tested. The highest synergistic effect was obtained with a combination of ampicillin and cefazolin or ampicillin and gentamicin.
