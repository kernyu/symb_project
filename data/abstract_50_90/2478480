We have compared the intraleukocytic survival of isogenic strains of Salmonella typhimurium, whose outer membrane lipopolysaccharide differed in O antigen and lipid A composition and whose susceptibility to nonoxidative antimicrobial granule proteins of human polymorphonuclear neutrophilis (PMN) could be established. We found that the order of resistance to the bactericidal activity of intact PMN of the three bacterial strains utilized closely resembled their ordered resistance to the purified human cationic antimicrobial 57,000-dalton protein (CAP57). LT-2, a smooth wild-type strain, was far more resistant than SH9178, its rough (Rb LPS) mutant. It was most significant that SH7426, a polymyxin B-resistant pmrA mutant of SH9178, not only was substantially more resistant to CAP57 and to intraphagocytic killing than SH9178 but also came close to being as resistant as LT-2. These experiments confirm earlier work that showed the importance of the glycosyl groups of O antigens of S. typhimurium for their resistance to O2-independent antimicrobial phagocytosis by PMN. The surprising result was that a rough strain, very susceptible to bactericide, became substantially more resistant when a mutation led to its lipid A phosphoryl groups being 100% substituted with amino pentoses. Yet unresolved is whether the protection is due to the loss of negative charges on the lipid A, the substitution of sugar molecules in vulnerable loci in the outer membrane, or both.
