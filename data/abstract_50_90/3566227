One hundred and ninety-one Proteus strains isolated from patients with various pathological processes were studied with respect to their sensitivity to 14 antibiotics. It was shown that their resistance depended on the isolation source and microbial species. Amikacin proved to be the most active agent. It was efficient against all the Proteus species, irrespective of the isolation source. Among the drugs efficient against P. mirabilis and P. vulgaris there were gentamicin, tobramycin and sisomicin sulphates.
