Far-ultraviolet radiation (254 nm) at a dose of 10, 20, and 30 J/m2 was found to disrupt the outer membrane permeability barrier of Escherichia coli to various antibiotics, dyes, and detergents. The degree of sensitization to these agents was proportional to the radiation dose. The irradiated cells showed a significant increase in the sensitivity of hydrophilic antibiotics (ampicillin, carbenicillin, penicillin), whereas much less sensitization was found towards hydrophobic probes (kanamycin, erythromycin, rifamycin SV, crystal violet, phenol, novobiocin) and detergents (dodecyl sulfate, bile salt, Triton X-100). The biochemical data and ultrastructural analysis of the outer membrane by freeze-etching have shown that the increase in phospholipid:protein ratio after irradiation had changed the architecture of the outer membrane from a highly asymmetric bilayer structure with densely packed lipopolysaccharide--protein particles on the outer half, to one predominantly exhibiting smooth phospholipid bilayer characteristics. The structure, composition, and barrier function of the outer membrane were restored to normal within 3 h of postirradiation incubation in nonproliferative medium. During this period, the acquisition of resistance towards a hydrophilic antibiotic (ampicillin) was faster than that for a hydrophobic agent (phenol).
