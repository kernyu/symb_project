Over the period 1983-1985, investigators from the Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology, Prague, and the Central Research Institute of Epidemiology, USSR Ministry of Public Health, Moscow, carried out a joint study of drug resistance in S. aureus strains in relation to their enterotoxigenic properties and phage group specificity. Altogether 277 strains were explored which had been isolated at random from the clinical material from infant and adult inpatients. Most of the isolated strains featured multiple resistance to antibiotics: PNC (77.9%), CMP (52.7%), TET (21.6%), ERY (17.6%) and LIN (11.9%). The strains isolated from infants were most frequently resistant to TET and ERY. No correlation was found between the incidence of antimicrobial drugs resistance and toxigenic properties of the isolated strains.
