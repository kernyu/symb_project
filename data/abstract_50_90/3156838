Methicillin activity against 149 penicillin-resistant, methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus strains from bacteraemia cases with endocarditis (n = 89) or without endocarditis (n = 60), from the years 1976-1981, was studied with broth dilution and agar dilution. While no differences in methicillin susceptibility were found in relation to the origin of the strains, Staph. aureus of the phage type complex 94,96 showed significantly higher MIC and IC50 by agar dilution than strains of other phage groups/complexes. This difference probably has no clinical importance but is of epidemiological interest. Broth dilution MIC was generally one dilution higher than agar dilution MIC, possibly explained by methodological factors. The MBC/MIC ratios never exceeded two in any of the strains, indicating a lack of tolerance in these clinically important isolates.
