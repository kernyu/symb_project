In vitro studies were undertaken to evaluate susceptibility tests with 30-micrograms ceftibuten disks. The following interpretive criteria were proposed: less than or equal to 17 mm for resistance (MIC, greater than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml) and greater than or equal to 21 mm for susceptibility (MIC, less than or equal to 8.0 micrograms/ml). A multilaboratory quality control study led to the conclusion that Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 should provide zones 29 to 35 mm in diameter.
