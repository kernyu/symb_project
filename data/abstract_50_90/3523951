The abscessing form of lactation mastitis as well as subaureolar abscesses with small foci (not more than 3-4 cm) should be expediently treated by a puncture method. In large foci permanent drainage should be used. Limited foci (up to 1-1.5 quadrants) in phlegmonous-abscessing form of mastitis must be carefully dissected. Treatment by incisions is indicated in cases with infiltrative-abscessing form of mastitis. Local treatment must be supplemented by antibacterial and detoxication therapy and by the means enhancing the organism resistance.
