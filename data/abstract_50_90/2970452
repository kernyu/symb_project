Trospectomycin sulphate, a novel analogue of spectinomycin, was compared to spectinomycin, tetracycline, lincosamide, macrolide, quinolone and naphthalenic ansamycin-class antibiotics for in-vitro activity against Mycoplasma pneumoniae, M. hominis and Ureaplasma urealyticum. MIC determinations were conducted by the agar dilution method using either SP-4 (Mycoplasma spp.) or A8 (U. urealyticum) agars. Trospectomycin compared favorably with tetracycline for all the strains of M. pneumoniae, M. hominis or U. urealyticum tested. Ciprofloxacin was the most active of the newer quinolones tested. Trospectomycin was as active as this quinolone antibiotic, or more active, in vitro. Other antibiotics such as the macrolides and lincosamides were highly active against one or more of the three mycoplasma groups tested but none was active against all three. The results suggest that trospectomycin may be useful in the treatment of mycoplasma-induced respiratory or genital tract infections in man.
