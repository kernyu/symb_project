We studied bacteriocinogenies and antibiotic resistances of naturally occurring strains of Streptococcus mutans isolated from different sources. It was found that naturally occurring strains from humans and rats were distinguished by their bacteriocin susceptibilities and production. We had a few incidences of tetracycline resistant strains only among those isolated from rats. It is quite interesting that none of the resistant strains we collected produced bacteriocins.
