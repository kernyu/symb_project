Urinary tract infection was in 15 per cent of 804 children presenting in general practice with symptoms suggestive of infection. Only 18 per cent of children with specific urinary symptoms and eight per cent of those with non specific symptoms were infected. All children with a proven urinary infection were investigated radiologically, and one third of these had an abnormality on a micturition cystourethrogram or intravenous pyelogram. Urine culture is the only way of detecting urinary infection, and radiological investigation is essential in all cases of proven infection.
