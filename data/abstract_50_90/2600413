The generation of protective immunity by various stages in the life-cycle of Strongyloides ratti and the phases against which resistance is directed has been examined in murine strongyloidiasis. Mice were exposed to natural, complete infections, were treated with thiabendazole (which largely resembles the natural infection), were treated with cambendazole (which restricts infection to the larval stage), or infected directly by oral transfer of adult worms. Mice that were infected with infective larvae alone did not become resistant to infective larvae or the complete infection but were resistant to adult worms implanted directly into the gut. Mice exposed to adult worms alone were resistant to natural infections and adults worms implanted directly but were not resistant to infective larvae. On the other hand, mice that had received prior natural infections showed evidence of resistance to infective larvae, adult worms, and natural, complete infections. It is concluded that there is immunological cross-reactivity between infective larvae and adult worms but that under certain circumstances the infective larvae are able to evade the host's protective immune response.
