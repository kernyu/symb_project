Antibiotic resistance of a wide set of strains (1501) of different serovars (69) was studied and the nature of the resistance was determined. Virulent bacteriophages designed with regard to the biological properties of the isolates were considered as possible agents for the control of antibiotic-resistant microorganisms. It was shown that multiple resistance to antibacterial drugs was mainly characteristic of the serovar of S. typhimurium. In Gorky and its region, strains carrying R plasmids determining the resistance to tetracycline and chloramphenicol with a molecular weight of 58-64 Md predominated. The antibiotic-resistant strains were dangerous from the epidemiological point of view. The use of the bacteriophages is advisable for the treatment of patients, sanation of bacterial carriers or decontamination of disease sources and prophylactic phaging with regard to the epidemiological indications for preventing group diseases.
