In vitro studies were performed with 74 Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates which were collected during a multicenter trial. The isolates were obtained from 70 patients who had been treated with netilmicin as the only antipseudomonal antibiotic. Clinically, 83% of the patients were cured or improved, and 64% of the Pseudomonas isolates were eliminated by chemotherapy. The 74 clinical isolates and 38 additional isolates with known mechanisms of aminoglycoside resistance were tested in three separate laboratories by disk diffusion methods and by microdilution tests with three broth media (Mueller-Hinton broth with full, half, and no cation supplements). Isolates that responded to netilmicin therapy and those that failed to respond were all susceptible by the disk test, and most were susceptible by microdilution tests with unsupplemented broth. However, over half of the clinical isolates appeared to be resistant when cations were added to the broth medium. Strains capable of producing enzymes that inactivate netilmicin were resistant by all methods tested. Broth dilution and agar dilution results were most comparable when half of the recommended cation supplements was added to Mueller-Hinton broth. Further consideration should be given to reducing the concentration of cations that are added to Mueller-Hinton broth when netilmicin susceptibility tests are being performed. However, additional studies with other aminoglycosides are needed before appropriate testing conditions can be standardized.
