Bacterial resistance to the beta-lactam group of antibiotics is frequently due to the production of beta-lactamase which brings about the inactivation of the antibiotic. Clavulanic acid is a naturally occurring inhibitor of beta-lactamase which is capable of rendering penicillin- and cephalosporin-resistant organisms sensitive. The compound is obtained by fermentation from Streptomyces clavuligerus. Clavulanic acid shows some structural similarity to the penicillins and cephalosporins and functions as a progressive inhibitor of a wide range of beta-lactamases including those found in Escherichia coli, Klebsiella aerogenes, Proteus species, Bacteroides fragilis, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Staphylococcus aureus. Clavulanic acid is well absorbed when given by mouth and a formulation with amoxycillin (Augmentin; Beechams) is now available for clinical use.
