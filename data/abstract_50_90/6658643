Amphotericin B-resistant mutants isolated from Chinese hamster V79 cells (1) are defective in cholesterol synthesis and more sensitive to an oxygenated sterol analog, 7-ketocholesterol, than their parental cell line. We isolated 7-ketocholesterol-resistant mutants from an amphotericin B-resistant mutant, AMBR-1. The 7-ketocholesterol-resistant mutants had regained increased level of free cholesterol, and they showed somewhat similar dose-response curves to amphotericin B as that of V79. Sterol synthesis from acetate, but not from mevalonate, in 7-ketocholesterol-resistant clones was threefold higher than that of AMBR-1. 7-Ketocholesterol-resistant clone, unlike AMBR-1, could form colonies in the presence of lipoprotein-depleted serum. The results are discussed in terms of probable change in the sterol biosynthetic pathway by the different lesions.
