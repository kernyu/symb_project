Comparative studies led to the working out of a new diffusion indicative method for the rapid determination of drug sensitivity in Gram-negative bacteria. It is a modification of the diffusion method, consisting in the use of an indicator medium, bromothymol blue in glucose agar, instead of the meat peptone agar or other routinely employed nutritive media. The new method makes it possible to record rapidly the drug sensitivity of bacteria--only for 4-6 hours (compared with 24 hours with the conventional method). Besides, the new method is readily applicable, precise, distinctive and rapid.
