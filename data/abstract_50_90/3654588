Cyanide-resistant respiration was induced in the yeast, Hansenula anomala in the presence of cyanide or antimycin A, which blocks the electron transport after ubiquinone. The de novo protein synthesis in cytosol and oxygen were deduced to be involved in this induction process. The period required for the induction varied during the growth stage, suggesting that involvement of additional physiological factor(s) in this induction process. The organism could multiply in the presence of antimycin A by developing cyanide-resistant respiration despite a decreased growth rate.
