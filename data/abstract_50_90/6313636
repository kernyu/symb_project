Based on the rationale that Escherichia coli cells containing increased levels of prolipoprotein signal peptidase would be highly resistant to globomycin, a specific inhibitor of the prolipoprotein signal peptidase, we have isolated a clone from the Carbon-Clarke collection, plasmid pLC3-13, which is globomycin-resistant and contains an increased level of prolipoprotein signal peptidase activity. The plasmid pMT521, a subclone of pLC3-13 in pBR322, conferred on its host cells approximately 20 times overproduction of prolipoprotein signal peptidase and an extremely high level of resistance against globomycin. The overproduced prolipoprotein signal peptidase was completely inhibited by the presence of globomycin in the in vitro assay, and the overproduced activity was found in the cell envelope fraction. Several lines of biochemical and genetic evidence suggest that the gene contained in pLC3-13 and its derivative clones is most likely the structure gene (lsp) for prolipoprotein signal peptidase.
