We give a review on the history of antimicrobial resistance of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, especially penicillinase-producing Neisseria gonorrhoeae (PPNG). Various mechanisms of antimicrobial resistance are described, and the present state concerning the therapy of gonorrhoea is discussed. The importance of the surveillance of the antimicrobial susceptibility pattern is supported by statistic data obtained in recently finished studies.
