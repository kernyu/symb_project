Male mice (C57BL/6J) from three age groups, 4, 14, and 26 months, were tested to determine their oxidation rate of intragastrically infused ethanol and the response of the centrally mediated jaw-jerk reflex to ethanol challenge. There were no age-related differences in the rate of oxidation of ethanol. However, age differences in ethanol-induced decrement of the jaw-jerk amplitude were significant. The 26 month animals were the most affected, followed by the 4 month group. The middle aged mice (14 month) showed the greatest resistance to the depression induced by ethanol. The results were evaluated with regard to the current hypotheses.
