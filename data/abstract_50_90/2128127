Retentive-pin twist drills were subjected to four methods of sterilization and then examined to determine possible effects on resistance to fracture, cutting efficiency, and surface condition. Sterilization methods included steam autoclave, chemical vapor autoclave, dry heat, and immersion in glutaraldehyde. Although the steam and chemical vapor groups had lower mean fracture strengths after sterilization, there was no statistically significant difference among the groups. Only the steam autoclave group showed a statistically significant loss of cutting efficiency. Scanning electron microscopic evaluation revealed that only drills sterilized by steam autoclave showed changes in the surface condition or cutting edges.
