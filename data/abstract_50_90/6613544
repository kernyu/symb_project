The effects of five minutes exposure to camphor, eucalyptus or menthol vapour on nasal resistance to airflow and nasal sensation of airflow were compared with the effects of exercise on the nose. Inhalation of camphor, eucalyptus or menthol had no effect on nasal resistance to airflow but the majority of subjects reported a cold sensation in the nose with the sensation of improved airflow. Exercise caused a decrease in nasal resistance but did not induce any nasal sensation of cold or improved airflow. The results indicate that camphor, eucalyptus and menthol stimulate cold receptors in the nose. The clinical significance of nasal sensation of airflow is discussed.
