A single nucleotide substitution in a highly conserved region of the mitochondrial genome of a mouse cell line confers both chloramphenicol resistance and an alteration to the recognition site for the endonuclease Eco RV. This has enabled a detailed study on the effects of selection on a mitochondrial population comprising initially both chloramphenicol-resistant and chloramphenicol-sensitive mitochondrial genomes. The mutation confers advantage to cells grown in the presence of chloramphenicol, but is apparently deleterious in its absence. Selection at the cellular level is sufficient to explain the results observed. Fixation, which results in cells having mitochondria of only a single type, is slow. It is probable, therefore, that mammalian oocyte mitochondria are derived from only a small number of progenitors. This would allow fixation of new mutations and explain the observed uniformity in mitochondrial genomes of the individual in the presence of extensive variation between different members of the population.
