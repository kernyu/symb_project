Resistance markers to individual antibiotics are transmitted in E. coli with the same frequency in the shape of a uniform linkage group, and in Proteus mirabilis--with a different one. Possibly in Proteus mirabilis plasmide R6 dissociated, this being expressed in a different incidence of transconjugates, characterized by a different set of antibiotic resistance genes. Tetracyclin resistance gene can be transmitted in P. mirabilis without being bound with other resistance determinants and with the functioning Tra-operon. The expression of individual antibiotic resistance genes of plasmide R6 in P. mirabilis differed, i.e. tetracycline resistance was inducible, and to kanamycin and chloramphenicol--constitutional. The level of expression of the gene controlling the tetracycline resistance was in noninduced condition in P. mirabilis, lower than in E. coli, P. mirabilis containing no R-factor possessed an inducible resistance mechanism to tetracycline, as in case of P. mirabilis strains containing R-factors.
