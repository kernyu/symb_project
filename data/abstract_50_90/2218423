In four prospective randomized clinical trials between November 1983 and March 1988, we studied 270 patients with severe bacterial infections, mainly lower respiratory tract ones. We compared ciprofloxacin and imipenem/cilastatin in the first study, ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin in the second study, ciprofloxacin and ticarcillin/clavulanic acid in the third study, and ofloxacin and cefpirome in the fourth study. A total of 90 pneumonias, 139 LRTIs, 22 septicaemias and 19 other bacterial infections were treated; the dominant pathogens were Pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacteria. Clinical success rates were high; cure or improvement was registered in 89% of the patients on ciprofloxacin, 89% on ofloxacin and 85% on beta-lactams. Treatment failures occurred mainly in ICU patients with terminal underlying diseases. Bacteriologically, eradication rates were high for enterobacteria and Staphylococcus aureus, but a relatively high persistence rate was seen for P. aeruginosa due to increased resistance and/or specific type and location of the infections. The incidence of side-effects was relatively high (23%-29%) which was related to careful monitoring. Adverse effects were group-specific (CNS reactions with quinolones, diarrhoea with beta-lactam antibiotics).
