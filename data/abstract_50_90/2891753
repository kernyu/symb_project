Between February 1983 and September 1985, an outbreak of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus involving 151 patients and staff occurred in a district general hospital. At its peak, 43 cases occurred in 3 months. Sixty-two patients suffered morbidity and two died. Conventional isolation techniques and once-daily whole body washing of affected patients with triclosan successfully controlled the outbreak.
