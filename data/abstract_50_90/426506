Netilmicin, a new semisynthetic aminoglycoside, was used in the treatment of 42 patients with serious gram-negative bacterial infections. Of the 40 evaluable patients, 24 (60%) were cured, and 8 (20%) had a favorable clinical response, for a total clinical response rate of 80%. Eight patients failed to respond; of these, three had undrained abscesses and two had severe granulocytopenia. Three of the patients who failed had organisms in which resistance to netilmicin developed during therapy, and in two of these three netilmicin was the only aminoglycoside to which resistance developed. Of the 37 patients evaluable for toxicity, 8 (22%) developed renal insufficiency. Two patients had mild but persistant elevation in serum creatinine. Three patients had nephrotoxicity while on gentamicin in the past. Pre- and posttherapy audiograms were done on 26 patients; none had hearing loss. Four patients had mild, transient asymptomatic elevations in alkaline phosphatase. The pretreatment clinical isolates were tested for in vitro susceptibility. The median minimal inhibitory concentration of netilmicin, gentamicin, and tobramycin ranged between 0.5 and 2 mug/ml. The median minimal inhibitory concentration of amikacin was approximately twofold higher. No clear in vitro superiority of one aminoglycoside over another was observed.
