The peptide pheromone, cCF10, which induces aggregation and high frequency plasmid transfer in Streptococcus faecalis cells carrying the tetracycline resistance plasmid, pCF10, was isolated and its structure determined. The molecular weight of cCF10 is 789, and its amino acid sequence is H-Leu-Val-Thr-Leu-Val-Phe-Val-OH. Pheromone activity, as determined by a clumping induction assay, was detectable at a concentration of 2.5 x 10(-11) M. A peptide of the same sequence as that of the cCF10 produced by S. faecalis cells was synthesized by the liquid-phase method. The synthetic pheromone showed biological activity and chromatographic behavior that was identical to that of the cCF10 of bacterial origin. When the response of S. faecalis cells to various concentrations of synthetic cCF10 was monitored by measuring both the frequency of plasmid transfer and the synthesis of pheromone-inducible antigens, an excellent correlation was observed between donor ability and the appearance of a 150-kilodalton protein that appears to be involved in formation of mating aggregates. The dose-response data in the range of concentrations where the amount of pheromone became limiting (10(-11)-10(-12) M) were consistent with the notion that as few as one or two molecules per donor cell may be sufficient to induce a mating response.
