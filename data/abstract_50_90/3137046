The minimum dosage of antibiotics which reduced mortality in rats intraperitoneally inoculated with an Escherichia coli isolate was determined. Low mortality rates (0-10%) were obtained when antibiotics with minimal or no inoculum effect (cefoxitin, cefmetazole and gentamicin) were administered to yield serum levels 3 to 20 times the MIC, while antibiotics with a pronounced inoculum effect (cefotaxime and aztreonam) had to be administered to yield serum levels 200 to 1,000 times the MIC determined with a standard (low) inoculum. Thus, it seems that the inoculum effect observed in vitro with some antibiotics for Escherichia coli may have clinical significance.
