With the significant increase in resistance of anaerobic bacteria to antimicrobial agents in recent years, susceptibility testing of these organisms becomes very important. In addition to survey studies, hospitals should be determining their local patterns, and therapy of at least the more serious infections should be guided by susceptibility tests. Of the various tests available, those most suitable for smaller hospitals for guidance of patient management are the broth disc elution procedure and the micro broth dilution tray test.
