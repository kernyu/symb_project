It was known that antibacterial spectrum and activity of CTM were superior to those of other cephalosporins. Basic and clinical studies in the field of obstetrics and gynecology on CTM were carried out. The results were summarized as follows. 1. Bacteriologically, the MIC of CTM against E. coli was less than 0.39 mcg/ml with an inoculum size of 10(6) CFU/ml. The 50% of Bacteroides sp. were inhibited by CTM at a concentration of 25 mcg/ml or less. 2. CTM was more stable against beta-lactamase extracted from B. fragilis than CEZ or cefpiramide. 3. After administration by the drip infusion of 1 g or 2 g to 5 cases, distribution of CTM to intrapelvic organs was measured. The results were relatively favourable. The concentration in the tissues was sufficient to inhibit clinical isolates such as E. coli and K. pneumoniae in the field of obstetrics and gynecology. 4. CTM was administered to 6 cases of various infections, and clinical response was excellent in 2 cases and good in 4 cases. No side effect nor adverse reaction of CTM was observed. Consequently CTM was considered to be one of useful antibiotics.
