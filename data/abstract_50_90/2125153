A controlled study of three short-course regimens was undertaken in South Indian patients with newly diagnosed, sputum-positive pulmonary tuberculosis. The patients were allocated at random to one of three regimens: a) Rifampicin, streptomycin, isoniazid and pyrazinamide daily for 3 months (R3); b) the same regimen as above but followed by streptomycin, isoniazid and pyrazinamide twice-weekly for a further period of 2 months (R5); c) the same as R5 but without rifampicin (Z5). A bacteriological relapse requiring treatment occurred by 5 years in 16.8% of 113 R3, 5.2% of 97 R5, and 20.0% of 115 Z5 patients with organisms sensitive to streptomycin and isoniazid initially. The differences in the relapse rates between the R3 and R5 regimens and the R5 and Z5 regimens were statistically significant (p less than 0.01 for both). Considering patients with organisms initially resistant to streptomycin or isoniazid or both, 7 of 52 patients (4 R3, 2 R5, 1 Z5) had a bacteriological relapse requiring retreatment.
