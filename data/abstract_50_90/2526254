Clarithromycin (TE-031, A-56268) was given orally to 25 children with acute bacterial infections including 5 with bronchitis, 8 with pneumonia, 4 with Mycoplasma pneumonia, 2 with pertussis and 6 with Campylobacter enteritis. Good to excellent clinical responses were obtained in 22 patients with bacterial eradication of all 10 strains. No side effect was observed. From the above clinical results, it appears that TE-031 is a useful antibiotic for the treatment of pediatrics with various bacterial infections.
