Twenty-four field isolates of Eimeria spp. which included Eimeria acervulina, E. praecox and E. mivati were tested for sensitivity to arprinocid included in the diet at 60 ppm. Twelve isolates from sites where arprinocid had been use for 5-7 successive flocks were resistant to the drug, whereas 12 isolates from sites where arprinocid had never been used were sensitive. These results indicate that resistance had been acquired as a result of the use of arprinocid in the field.
