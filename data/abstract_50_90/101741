Two isolates of Neisseria gonorrhoeae from two patients who did not respond to repeated treatment with penicillin were found to contain an active beta-lactamase. This enzyme has not been previously found in other gonococci isolated in the United States. Compared to other gonococci, these isolates had higher penicillin minimal inhibitory concentrations, and gave very small or no zones of inhibition in the disc agar diffusion test. The enzyme was demonstrated with three different rapid tests for beta-lactamase, by disc diffusion assay methods, and by gas-liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry determination of penicilloic acid--the enzymatic end product from penicillin.
