The prevalence of tetracycline-resistant beta-haemolytic streptococci in South-west Essex has been recorded over the past 10 years. It has fallen from a peak of 35% in 1965 to a level of 9.2% in 1972. Ear infections no longer provide the highest incidence of these organisms; vaginal, perineal, and skin infections now seem to be of greater relative importance but throat swabs still provide the greatest actual number of isolations. Erythromycin-resistant strains are still rare.
