Clinical studies were performed on 115 fungal strains isolated from the urine of 36 patients. The predisposing factors were fungal urinary tract infections, antibiotics and indwelling catheter. Forty five strains of the 115 strains were Candida albicans, the most prevalent, followed by 25 strains of C. tropicalis and 22 strains of Trichosporon beigelii. Species of Torulopsis were rare, only 5 strains were isolated. Sixty strains (56%) co-existed with bacteria in urine. The co-existing bacteria most frequently isolated were Pseudomonas and Streptococcus. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 5-FU was measured using the Bact-Morphology Agar medium. C. albicans, C. guillermondii, and Torulopsis glabrata showed an excellent MIC (under 0.78 microgram/ml), C. tropicalis, C. parapsilosis, T. beigelii, and T. cutaneum showed a poor MIC (over 100 micrograms/ml).
