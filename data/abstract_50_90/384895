A total of 30 clinical isolates of group B streptococci were studied for penicillin tolerance in vitro. Minimal inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations of penicillin were determined simultaneously in three test media which have been used for group B streptococci, tryptose phosphate, Mueller-Hinton, and Todd-Hewitt broths, using a logarithmic-phase inoculum of 10(5) colony-forming units per ml. Minimal inhibitory concentrations in the three media did not differ significantly. However, minimal bactericidal concentrations were significantly higher in tryptose phosphate broth (mean, 1.04 mug/ml) than in Mueller-Hinton broth (0.22 mug/ml) or Todd-Hewitt broth (0.15 mug/ml). Similarly, ratios of minimal bactericidal to minimal inhibitory concentrations were significantly greater in tryptose phosphate broth than in Mueller-Hinton or Todd-Hewitt broth. After incubation in tryptose phosphate broth for an additional 24 h, the minimal bactericidal concentration consistently fell to levels which were only twice or equal to the minimal inhibitory concentration. This study illustrates the importance of the medium in the demonstration of penicillin tolerance and of controlling laboratory variables in the susceptibility testing of group B streptococci with penicillin.
