In 1983 an increase in the resistance rate of cefotaxime against Enterobacter cloacae strains was observed in "Laikos General" hospital, that reached 59.3% in the 2nd half of the same year. All strains resistant to cefotaxime were found resistant to cefamandole, moxalactam and ceftriaxone while 61.8% were also resistant to amikacin. Urine represented the main source of isolation, particularly from the catheterized patient of the Renal Transplantation Unit in whom cefuroxime was mostly over used. Multiresistant strains were virulent since 5 patients died of septicemia. Mechanisms of resistance to cefotaxime are speculated upon because resistance work-up has not yet been completed. SHV, was exclusively isolated in the limited number of strains which have been studied up to now.
