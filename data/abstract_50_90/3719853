The authors carried out a study to evaluate the epidemiology and resistance of netilmicin, gentamicin, tobramycin and amikacin during the 1984-1985 period. Clinical specimens of different origin, drawn both from hospitalized and outpatients were used in the study. The strains were tested for their sensitivity to aminoglycosides. In particular the degree of resistance in both fermentative and non-fermentative gram-negative strains was determined. As previously pointed out in other works, netilmicin showed good antimicrobial activity in respect to other aminoglycosides.
