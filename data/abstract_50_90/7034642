Twenty-two adult patients with urinary tract infections caused by penicillin-resistant bacteria completed treatment with amoxicillin alone or amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid in a randomized double-blind clinical trial. Of the 13 patients treated with amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid, the absence of bacteriuria within 7 days of therapy was observed in 85%, as compared with only 25% of the 8 patients receiving amoxicillin only. There were no significant side effects nor any clinical, biochemical, or hematological abnormalities related to either treatment. It was concluded that the combination of clavulanic acid and amoxicillin could be useful in the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infection caused by penicillin-resistant bacteria.
