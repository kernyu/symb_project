The effect of maternal alcohol infusions on fetal cerebral function in terms of the electroencephalogram (EEG) and fetal brain metabolism was studied in 10 fetal sheep experiments. A 9.75 per cent alcohol-dextrose solution was infused at the rate of 15 c.c. per kilogram of maternal weight for 1 or 2 hours. Fetal cerebral uptake of oxygen was unaffected. Blood flow was significantly increased as a result of a greater decrease in resistance than decrease in blood pressure. The cerebral uptake of glucose and the glucose-oxygen utilization ratio were significantly increased. The EEG showed a decrease in amplitude and slowing of the dominant rhythm as the blood alcohol concentration increased and became isoelectric on occasion during the postinfusion period associated with a severe fetal acidosis.
