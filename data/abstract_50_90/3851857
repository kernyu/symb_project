Fundamental and clinical studies were made on the intravenous administration of aspoxicillin (ASPC) in pediatric field and the following results were obtained. The peak serum concentrations of 15.6-84.0 micrograms/ml were seen immediately after a 1-hour drip infusion of 10-30 mg/kg, there being seen a clear dose response. The half-life was 0.78-1.67 hours and the measurable concentrations were detected in the serum up to 6 hours after administration. The urinary excretion rate was 44.1-78.6% up to 6 hours after drip infusion. Twenty-four patients with acute respiratory tract infection (21 cases), urinary tract infection (3 cases) were treated with ASPC by drip infusion of 50-107 mg/kg/day for 5-15 days and resulted in 100% of good response. S. pyogenes, S. viridans, E. coli, H. influenzae and P. aeruginosa were isolated form the culture of sputum or urine in the patients, and they were all eradicated by treatment with ASPC except P. aeruginosa. No side effects were observed except the elevation of GOT and GPT in 1 case. From the above results, it is concluded that ASPC is one of useful drug for treatment of infections in pediatric field.
