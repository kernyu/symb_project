The efficacy and tolerance of Cefazedon, a new antibiotic, was investigated clinically on 90 patients with urinary tract infections who also required surgical treatment. Good clinical results were achieved in over 90% of patients after 6 to 7 days of treatment. The bacteriological examination revealed complete elimination of the initially identified pathogens in 89 cases. No difference in treatment results could be established when applying the dose 2 or 3 times daily. On the third day of treatment skin reactions were observed in one case which necessitated discontinuation of treatment. Laboratory blood values as well as control of liver and kidney function before treatment, after and one week past treatment showed no negative influence due to the drug. In approximately 27% a new colonisation mainly with Pseudomonas could not be prevented.
