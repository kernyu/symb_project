Peritoneal macrophage ganglioside patterns and ganglioside sialic acid content were compared for two congenic strains of mice having differing responses to bacterial lipopolysaccharide. Resident macrophage ganglioside patterns from C3H/HeJ mice (endotoxin hyporesponsive) and C3H/HeN mice (endotoxin responsive) were similar. Macrophages elicited with phenol-extracted or butanol-extracted endotoxin showed distinctly more complex ganglioside patterns in C3H/HeN mice. C3H/HeJ macrophages showed distinct, but less complex changes when elicited with butanol-extracted endotoxin. As expected, there were minimal alterations induced by phenol-extracted endotoxin in the C3H/HeJ patterns. When injected with whole killed E. coli, both strains of mice exhibited complex ganglioside patterns; however, there were relative differences in the quantities of multiple gangliosides. Differences in ganglioside patterns were mirrored in the relative ratios of N-acetyl- to N-glycolylneuraminic acid. When macrophages were activated by administration of either endotoxin preparation, macrophage gangliosides from C3H/HeN mice always contained a higher proportion of N-acetylneuraminic acid compared with C3H/HeJ macrophage gangliosides. Oxidative metabolism of the macrophage populations was assessed by PMA-induced H2O2 release. This indicated that endotoxin activation produced an increase in PMA-induced H2O2 release as well as a shift of sialic acid class from the N-glycolyl type to the N-acetyl type. However, no direct correlation could be made between ganglioside composition, sialic acid content, and macrophage function. These data indicate that both ganglioside composition and sialic acid composition of macrophages are profoundly altered with endotoxin activation. The data further indicate that under conditions which C3H/HeJ mice respond to Gram-negative bacteria, their macrophage ganglioside patterns still differ from normal mice.
