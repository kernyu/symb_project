Eighteen cases of various infections, mostly having severe underlying diseases and showing no or insufficient responses to antibacterial chemotherapy, were treated with additional intravenous drip infusion of SM-4300 (2.5 or 5 g, once a day, for 1-3 days). Eight of the cases were excluded from the assessment of the effectiveness, as they died too early, or as their fever was supposed to have been "tumor fever" retrospectively. SM-4300 was found to be effective in 2 out of 5 septicemia cases, in 3 pneumonia cases, including 1 complicated with septicemia, out of 4, and also in 1 patient with liver abscess, as well as in another of meningitis caused by Campylobacter fetus; i.e. the efficacy rate was estimated as 60% in total. Any side effects attributable to SM-4300 were observed in none of the 18 cases. These results obtained seem to endorse the usefulness of the preparation.
