An attempt was made to assess the occurrence of R factor-mediated antibiotic resistance in the healthy population. Samples of aerobic, gram-negative intestinal bacteria from men from various parts of the country at military conscription were analysed for transferable drug resistance. The obtained frequency, about 15% of R factor carriers in the studied group, was interpreted to reflect the existence of a reservoir of R factors, from which resistant, pathogenic bacteria could be selected under antibiotic therapy. Resistance to tetracycline, streptomycin and sulfonamides dominated among the identified R factor-borne resistance traits.
