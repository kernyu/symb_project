The in vitro activity of cefoperazone (T-1551) against almost 9,000 recent clinical isolates at six institutions was tested and compared with that of cephalothin and gentamicin. The modal minimum inhibitory concentrations of cefoperazone were 16- and 4-fold less than those of cephalothin and gentamicin, respectively, against 5,503 strains of Enterobacteriaceae. Species normally resistant to cephalothin, such as indole-positive protease and enterobacters, were almost universally susceptible to cefoperazone. Cefoperazone demonstrated activity comparable to gentamicin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other pseudomonads.
