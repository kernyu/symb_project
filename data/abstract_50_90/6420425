Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was measured autoradiographically with [14C]iodoantipyrine as a diffusible tracer in two strains of conscious normotensive rats (Wistar Kyoto and local Wistar) and in two groups of spontaneously hypertensive stroke-prone rats (SHRSP) with a mean arterial pressure (MAP) below or above 200 mm Hg. In spite of the large differences in arterial pressure, rCBF did not differ significantly between the hypertensive and the normotensive groups in any of the 14 specified brain structures measured. However, rCBF increased asymmetrically within part of the caudate-putamen in two of nine SHRSP with a MAP above 200 mm Hg, indicating a regional drop in the elevated cerebrovascular resistance.
