We have evaluated the effectiveness and safety of norfloxacin (NFLX) in 18 children with infectious diseases. Doses ranging from 5.6 to 18.8 mg/kg/day for t.i.d. or q.i.d. were used. The causative bacteria were Campylobacter jejuni in 3 cases, Salmonella typhimurium in 1, Staphylococcus aureus in 2, Haemophilus influenzae in 1 and unknown in 11 cases. Except 1 strain of S. aureus, all the bacteria mentioned above were eradicated. Clinical effects were excellent in 8, good in 8, poor in 2, and the total efficacy rate was 88.9%. No side effects nor abnormal laboratory test results were observed. These results have shown that the NFLX is a usefull drug for infectious diseases in the pediatric field.
