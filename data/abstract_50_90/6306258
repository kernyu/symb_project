Insertions of transposon Tn5 were used to examine the genetics of motility mutants in Myxococcus. Fifteen independent insertions of Tn5 were isolated that were linked to seven different loci that govern motility. Among the motility mutants that can be stimulated to move transiently by contact with other cells, a one-to-one correspondence was confirmed between specificity of stimulation and genetic locus. There are six different specificities and six corresponding loci, as if each locus governs a different protein required for gliding motility.
