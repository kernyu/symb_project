Human T-lymphotropic virus type III is susceptible to attack at various sites during its replicative cycle. Inhibitors of reverse transcriptase activity, including suramin, antimoniotungstate (HPA-23), and trisodium phosphonoformate, have shown in-vitro activity against the virus in early clinical trials. Other significant antiviral agents are recombinant interferon alpha-A, ribavirin, and ansamycin. Double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials of interferon alpha, which inhibits viral replication at easily achievable serum levels, are underway. The development of optimal therapeutic regimens will require carefully controlled, multicenter collaborative trials with standardized criteria for evaluating responses. Prolonged treatment with combinations of antiviral and immunomodulating agents may be necessary for control of HTLV-III replication and for effective treatment of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.
