The effect of 8-bromo cyclic adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (8-Br-cAMP) on sugar and amino acid transport was investigated in wild-type Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and in mutants selected for resistance to cAMP inhibition of cell growth. In wild type cells, both 3-O-methyl-D-glucose and alpha-aminoisobutyric acid transport were decreased in cells treated for 24 h with 8-Br-cAMP; kinetic analysis indicated that a decrease in Vmax, without a significant change in Km, accounted for the lower transport capacity of 8-Br-cAMP treated cells. Among the different transport systems contributing to amino acid entry, "alanine" preferring transport system (system A) appeared to be specifically affected. The sensitivity of transport processes to 8-Br-cAMP was tested in three cAMP-resistant cell lines. When tested for their capacity to phosphorylate histones in crude extracts, one strain had apparently normal amounts of protein kinase activity, one strain had a decreased enzyme sensitivity to cAMP, and one strain had little or no enzyme activity. In all three mutants, no effect of 8-Br-cAMP on 3-O-methyl glucose and alpha-aminoisobutyric acid transport could be observed, regardless of the level of cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity. These data do not indicate whether the effect of cAMP on nutrient transport in CHO cells is the cause or consequence of growth inhibition. However, they support the conclusion that, in CHO cells, the presence of a normally functioning cAMP-dependent protein kinase appears to be necessary but may not be sufficient to observe the effects of cAMP on nutrient transport as well as cell shape and cell growth.
