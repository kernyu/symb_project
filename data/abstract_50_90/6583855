Interspecific somatic cell hybrids were isolated following the fusion of an oligomycin-resistant derivative of LM (TK-) mouse cells to a chloramphenicol-resistant derivative of AK412 Chinese hamsters cells. Hybrids were selected in either HAT medium, HAT plus chloramphenicol (CAP), HAT plus oligomycin (OLI), or HAT plus chloramphenicol and oligomycin. Cytogenetic analysis of the hybrids indicated that their karyotype reflected the sum of the parents. Hybrids selected in HAT medium alone or HAT plus OLI retained primarily mouse mitochondrial DNA while those selected in HAT plus CAP, or HAT plus CAP plus OLI retained both species of mitochondrial DNA. There was no evidence for mitochondrial DNA recombination, despite the continued growth of these hybrids in CAP plus OLI. Hybrids that were removed from dual antibiotic selection for over three months retained both species of mitochondrial DNA in approximately equal amounts with no detectable loss or rearrangement.
