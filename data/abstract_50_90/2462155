Punta Toro virus infections of inbred strains of mice have been characterized and evaluated as a model in which to study various aspects of the host response to phlebovirus infections and the requirements for protective immunity. The Adames strain of Punta Toro virus was found to be strongly hepatotropic and lymphotropic and the outcome of infection was largely a function of age. C57BL/6J mice of less than 5 weeks of age uniformly developed fulminant hepatocellular necrosis with mean survival times of 4.2 days. Resistance to lethal infection increased with age such that greater than 95% of 8-week-old mice survived challenge. The kinetics of viremia, antibody production, and hematological changes in 4- and 8-week animals indicated that the survival of the older animals is related to their ability to delay virus replication and the development of hepatic lesions during the initial 48 h of infection and their ability to terminate virus replication and clear virus from the circulation 4 to 5 days after infection. The mechanisms responsible for this resistance were studied using anti-interferon serum, immunosuppression, and passive immunization.
