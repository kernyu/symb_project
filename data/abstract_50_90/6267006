The structural and regulatory functions encoding tetracycline resistance in transposon Tn10 lie within a 2,700-base pair region. Using recombinant plasmids with different deoxyribonucleic acid sequences adjacent to a HincII site in this region, we located the promoter controlling the expression of tetracycline resistance. These various sequences conferred altered levels of tetracycline resistance. Plasmids containing deletions of a 695-base pair HincII fragment were constitutive and showed the loss of a 23,000-dalton tetracycline-inducible polypeptide, thus identifying the repressor and the location of its gene.
