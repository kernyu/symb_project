Mutants of the human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) that were 6- to 13-fold more resistant to phosphonoacetic acid than the wild-type HCMV (Towne) were isolated. Extracts from mycoplasma-free, mutant-infected cells had phosphonoacetate-resistant DNA polymerase activity in vitro. This strongly suggests that the selected mutations are in the HCMV DNA polymerase genes of these viruses.
