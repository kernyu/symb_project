We have determined the sequence of an oligonucleotide from the large ribosomal subunit RNA of Staphylococcus aureus whose methylation renders the organism resistant to erythromycin and other antibiotics (the "MLS" phenotype). Analysis of RNase A digests of [3H]methyl-, 32P-labeled RNA yielded the sequence GG . m6(2)A . AAGACp, where m6(2)A is an N6-dimethylated adenosine residue that in sensitive cells is unmethylated. Comparison with homologous sequences recently reported for Saccharomyces cerevesiae mitochondria indicates that an A to G mutation in this latter system mimics dimethylation in St. aureus with regard to functional consequences.
