Sixty strains of Haemophilus influenzae were isolated from the genitourinary tracts of adults: 19 from cervicovaginal secretions, one from a woman with bartholinitis, 37 from urethral exudates, and three from urine. Non-capsulated strains were recovered predominantly, and biotype III accounted for 28 isolates and biotype IV for 25. Many of the H influenzae strains were found to be resistant to one or more of the antibiotics commonly used against sexually transmitted diseases. Resistance to tetracycline was prevalent and was found in 17 of the strains. Ten strains were ampicillin resistant and beta lactamase producing. Kanamycin resistance was less common (two strains). Trospectomycin (U-63366), a new spectinomycin analogue, was eight to 16 times more active than spectinomycin. All the quinolones tested were very active against all strains and may provide an effective alternative for the treatment of resistant H influenzae in genitourinary infections.
