An amphotericin B-resistant cell (AMBR-1), which was isolated from aneuploid Chinese hamster cells (V79), was found to show much higher resistance than the parent V79 cells to other polyene antibiotics, such as pentamycin and filipin. To obtain the 50 to 60% inhibition of the control protein synthesis activity by a synergistic combination of fusidic acid and amphotericin B, 50 microgram fusidic acid per ml were combined with 10 microgram amphotericin B in V79 cells, whereas in AMBR cells 50 microgram fusidic acid per ml were combined with 100 microgram polyene antibiotic per ml. Bleomycin (10 microgram/ml), which alone did not affect cellular DNA synthesis, inhibited DNA synthesis of V79 cells by more than 90% of the control activity when combined with only 1 microgram pentamycin per ml, whereas a similar extent of inhibition in AMBR cells was observed by combination with more than 5 microgram pentamycin per ml.
