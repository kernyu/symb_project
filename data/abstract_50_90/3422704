A primarily genetic approach was employed to obtain plasmids in Rhodococcus erythropolis ATCC 12674 which carried genes conferring increased resistance to sodium arsenate and arsenite, cadmium chloride, and chloramphenicol. The plasmids were large, migrating more slowly than chromosomal DNA in agarose gels, and were made up of resistance determinants from the host organism together with part of the genome of nocardiophage Q4. Purified plasmid was used to transform a suitable recipient to increased resistance to sodium arsenate, sodium arsenite, and cadmium chloride.
