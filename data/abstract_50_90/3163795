Two strains of Eimeria tenella with different decoquinate sensitivity and different glucose phosphate isomerase (GPI) isozymes were used in genetic recombination experiments: a line derived from a laboratory strain (NIAH) was decoquinate-resistant (DR) and had the isozyme GPI-9, while a field isolate (Iwate strain) was decoquinate-sensitive (DS) and had GPI-1. Coccidia-free chickens were orally inoculated with mixed oocysts of the two strains and parasites of the F1 generation were recovered. The F1 progeny showed both forms of the isozyme. Next, oocysts of the F1 progeny were passaged through chickens given the decoquinate-containing diet. The F2 progeny also had GPI-1 and GPI-9, indicating cross-fertilization between the two strains. Six single oocysts were isolated from F2 progeny; 1 showed both phenotypes of GPI, 1 had GPI-1 and the remaining 4 lines had GPI-9. Analysis of the amount of GPI in recombinant oocysts suggested that the proliferation rate of the DR strain was slower than that of the DS strain. We concluded that GPI isozymes in E. tenella can serve as useful markers in experiments on chicken coccidia.
