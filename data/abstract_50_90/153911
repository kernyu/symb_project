A single gene nuclear yeast mutant was isolated whose mitochondrial F1-ATPase was resistant to the specific F1 inhibitor aurovertin. The mutant enzyme was not cross-resistant to other F1 inhibitors. The binding of aurovertin to F1 and to the two largest F1 subunits (alpha and beta) was measured by enhancement of aurovertin fluorescence. Aurovertin bound to wild type F1-ATPase and to its monomeric beta subunit with about the same binding constant. It failed to bind to wild type alpha subunit or to either F1 or F1 subunits from the mutant. The aurovertin-resistant mutant thus contains an altered nuclear gene which specifies the structure of the beta subunit of F1.
