The MICs and minimal lethal concentrations of four antimycotics, amphotericin B, 5-fluorocytosine, miconazole nitrate, and ketoconazole, were determined for 25 yeast isolates representing species uncommonly implicated in candidiasis. A microdilution procedure was employed with complex and synthetic media. The isolates, in general, were susceptible to the same antimicrobial agents shown to be effective against Candida albicans, but differences between some of the species in relative susceptibilities to the antifungal agents were noted. Isolates of atypical sucrose-negative Candida tropicalis were similar in their susceptibility patterns to typical isolates of the species. Relative resistance to amphotericin B, miconazole nitrate, and ketoconazole was noted for two Candida lusitaniae isolates, but all strains were susceptible to 5-fluorocytosine. Candida norvegensis isolates were more resistant to miconazole and ketoconazole than C. albicans clinical isolates. The microtiter system was satisfactory for determining minimal inhibitory concentrations, but the system is not recommended for detecting finite differences in drug susceptibilities or for detecting drug synergism.
