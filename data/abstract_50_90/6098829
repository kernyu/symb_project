The DNA coding sequence for the hygromycin B phosphotransferase gene was placed under the control of the regulatory sequences of a cloned long terminal repeat of Moloney sarcoma virus. This construction allowed direct selection for hygromycin B resistance after transfection of eucaryotic cell lines not naturally resistant to this antibiotic, thus providing another dominant marker for DNA transfer in eucaryotic cells.
