Human milk with high bacterial load of B. cereus var. fluorescens is reported. The organism was identified by morphological, cultural, and biochemical characteristics. Lecithinase and haemolysin were produced in rabbit and bovine blood. The toxigenic nature of the organism was confirmed by production of necrosis on rabbit skin and fluid accumulation in rabbit ileal loop. An antibiotic resistogram also has been included.
