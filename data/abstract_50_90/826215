The dynamics of the changes in sensitivity of gonococci to penicillin within 1958-1974 was studied. It was shown that penicillin sensitivity of gonococci decreased. The sensitivty of gonococci was transferred on passages which explains predominant isolation of the resistant strains from males with fresh gonorrhea and from females with chronic gonorrhea and girls. Gonococci with low sensitivity levels to penicillin were isolated from most of the patients with complicated and ascending forms of gonorrhea. The resistance development was often preceded by irrational and incompleted therapy.
