In a recent nosocomial outbreak of Pseudomonas pickettii infection at the general hospital of Corbeil-Essonnes, France, two patients were moderately affected, but two others, who were diabetic, died of septicemia. The infection was transmitted by 0.05% aqueous solutions of chlorhexidine, the treatment of water for these solutions being the cause of contamination. The ion-exchange resin in the deionization cartridges allowed the surviving bacteria in the city water supply to grow while the bacteriological filters downstream only lowered the contamination level. The 0.05% chlorhexidine aqueous solutions failed to prevent growth up to 4 X 10(6) bacteria/ml. P. pickettii is resistant to aminoglycosides and colistine.
