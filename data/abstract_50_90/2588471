Groups of 10 goats, harbouring both naturally acquired and experimental infections of gastrointestinal nematodes, were drenched with either levamisole (5 mg kg-1), albendazole (3.8 mg kg-1) or parbendazole (15 mg kg-1), or remained untreated. Haemonchus contortus was the numerically dominant infection, with Strongyloides papillosus, Trichostrongylus colubriformis and Oesophagostomum columbianum also present. At 5-6 days post-treatment, goats were killed and necropsied. Post-mortem worm counts showed that the reduction in mean total worm burdens was 57.4% in levamisole-treated animals, 71.1% in the albendazole group and 85.1% in the parbendazole group. Reductions for H. contortus were 80.2, 87.9 and 83.9% in the levamisole-, albendazole- and parbendazole-treated groups, respectively. These data indicate that the anthelmintics in question are not being applied at an adequate dose rate for goats, and/or resistance to anthelmintics is occurring in the field in Pernambuco State, northeast Brazil.
