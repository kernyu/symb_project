The 2.3-kb Hind-III fragment containing the gentamicin resistance aacC2 gene was cloned from a clinical strain of E. coli with the aminoglycoside resistance pattern indicative of ++aminoglycoside acetyltransferase AAC (3)-II. An approach based on the phenomenon of the replicon dissociation of high molecular weight plasmids was applied. The restriction map of the cloned fragment was constructed. It was shown by subcloning the fragment that the aacC2 gene was localized within the 1.1-kb Alu I-Sal I fragment.
