Reports of staphylococci resistant to the semisynthetic penicillins stimulated a study of the factors influencing the stability of the drugs in discs. The behavior of penicillin G, methicillin, oxacillin, cloxacillin, and cephalothin discs under different humidity and temperature conditions is described. Humidity was found to be the most significant factor in drug inactivation. Storage of discs in a vacuum desiccator at -20 C provides maximal antibiotic stability.
