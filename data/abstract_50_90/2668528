Seven clinical isolates of chloramphenicol-resistant Haemophilus influenzae were studied. The products of chloramphenicol inactivation by chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) were identified by high performance liquid chromatography. The sole product in H. influenzae is a single monoacetyl compound, whereas variants of CAT isolated from other chloramphenicol-resistant bacteria usually produce both monoacetyl and diacetyl chloramphenicol metabolites. The chloramphenicol resistance gene was found to reside on a 65-kb plasmid which, in five of the six cases studied, appeared to be integrated into the host cell chromosome.
