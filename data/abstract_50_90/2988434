A clinical isolate, Serratia marcescens 75, was found to be susceptible to netilmicin and yet had a high level of aminoglycoside 2''-O-nucleotidyltransferase activity for netilmicin. Kinetic studies of the partially purified enzyme revealed substrate inhibition for gentamicin and tobramycin at concentrations greater than 10(-2) mM, but this was not observed for netilmicin. The MICs of the aminoglycosides tested exhibited a good inverse correlation with the Km values for the enzyme and a direct correlation with the Vmax/Km ratios of the enzyme.
