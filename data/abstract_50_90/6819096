Using agar dilution techniques, we determined the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of 11 antimicrobials for 70 isolates of Neisseria gonorrhoeae obtained in Bangui, Central African Republic. These gonococci were found to be fairly susceptible to commonly used antibiotics: only 3 isolates (4%) had a penicillin MIC >/= 1.0 mug/ml and 6 (9%) had a tetracycline MIC >/= 2.0 mug/ml. With regard to other antibiotics, 54 isolates (77%) had an erythromycin MIC >/= 0.25 mug/ml, all had a spectinomycin MIC </= 16 mug/ml, and 32 (46%) had a sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim MIC >/= 9.5/0.5 mug/ml. None of these isolates produced penicillinase.This study has helped to provide a rational basis for establishing national gonorrhoea treatment recommendations in the Central African Republic.
