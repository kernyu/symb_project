Serial in vitro and in vivo tests for chloroquine sensitivity of Plasmodium falciparum were carried out from 1979 to 1982 in an area of E. Africa where chemosuppression with chloroquine had been attempted since 1977. Within 1(1/2) years there were signs of a decreasing drug response. Chloroquine resistance was first detected in 1981 and this increased markedly in 1982. Other contributory causes for the rise of parasite rates in children were possibly a decline in the efficiency of the drug distribution system and also immunological factors. Evidence of resistance to pyrimethamine was also found. Observations were made of the heterogeneity of the parasites' responses with emerging resistance. Implications for the future are discussed.
