Proteeae carriage was evaluated in groin skin carriers following vigorous antiseptic application. Three Proteus mirabilis carriers were treated with 60% isopropyl alcohol or 4% chlorhexidine, observed to prevent skin contact, and then recultured; at four and eight hours P mirabilis numbers remained undiminished. Ten Proteeae carriers received a series of nine body baths with soap, chlorhexidine, and 0.75% povidone-iodine plus three cefazolin injections over 16 to 34 days; cumulative treatments failed to clear seven carriers. Within three months, all were again carriers. Proteeae carriers also had affinity for groin carriage of various aerobic gram-negative bacilli (AGNB) including cefazolin-resistant strains. In seven subjects, more than one AGNB species were recovered shortly after applying an antiseptic. Proteeae groin skin carriage appears to reflect a major change in the nature of resident bacteria on intact groin skin.
