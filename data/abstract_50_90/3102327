An HTY medium osmotically stabilized with 0.5 M D-glucitol was used for regeneration of Bacillus subtilis protoplasts. The application of glucitol as osmotic stabilizer allows simultaneous selection of cells resistant to kanamycin to be made since this antibiotic is not inactivated by glucitol when added to the regeneration medium.
