Erythrocytes infected with chloroquine-sensitive Plasmodium falciparum bind chloroquine with an apparent intrinsic association constant of 1.5 x 10(7) liters per mole. Such high-affinity binding of chloroquine is absent or deficient in uninfected erythrocytes and in erythrocytes infected with chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium falciparum.
