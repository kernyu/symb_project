Lincomycin and clindamycin are still effective against anaerobic bacteria, and their antibacterial activity has also been indicated against gram-positive aerobic cocci, chiefly Staphylococcus aureus. The present emergency due to epidemiological circulation of Staphylococci, especially coagulase-negative, methicillin-resistant, and the question of the current validity of the lincosamides, induced us to study the activity of lincomycin and clindamycin against staphylococci belonging to different lyogroups in comparison to erythromycin. Clindamycin showed good antibacterial activity while methicillan-resistant strains showed an increase in resistance to erythromycin and lincomycin.
