The susceptibility of Mycobacterium leprae to clinical and experimental antileprosy agents was assessed in the BACTEC 460 system. Nude-mouse-derived M. leprae (10(7) cells), incubated in BACTEC 12B medium at 33 degrees C under reduced oxygen, maintained a fairly constant growth index (14CO2 evolution) for 2 to 3 weeks. At concentrations ranging from 0.031 to 2.0 micrograms/ml, dapsone, rifampin, clofazimine, ethionamide, ofloxacin, clarithromycin, and minocycline all effected reductions in the growth index within 1 to 2 weeks, the extent of inhibition increasing with the incubation time. An in vivo rifampin-resistant isolate displayed markedly reduced susceptibility to rifampin compared with an in vivo-susceptible strain. This system appears to be highly suitable for in vitro drug susceptibility testing of M. leprae.
