Resistance to the aminoglycosides gentamicin, tobramycin and kanamycin (GmTmKmR) in Australian clinical strains of Staphylococcus aureus is commonly carried on the composite transposon Tn4001. The resistance gene aacA-aphD of Tn4001, which encodes a bifunctional AAC(6')-APH(2") modifying enzyme, is flanked by two 1324-bp inverted repeats, IS256L and IS256R, that are identical in sequence. Analysis of the IS256 sequence revealed structural features characteristic of IS elements including 26-bp imperfect terminal inverted repeats and a single open reading frame with coding capacity for a 45.6 kDa protein. The nucleotide sequence of IS256 described here, together with the sequence of the aacA-aphD gene reported previously [Rouch et al., J. Gen. Microbiol. 133 (1987) 3039-3052], completes the entire sequence of Tn4001, which totals 4566 bp.
