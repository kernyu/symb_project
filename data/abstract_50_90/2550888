When cultured on collagen coated nitrocellulose filters, thyroid epithelial cells form morphologically and functionally polarized monolayers. The bioelectric parameters of these monolayers were measured after mounting in Ussing chambers; transepithelial potential (Vab), short circuit current (Isc) and transepithelial resistance were respectively 12 +/- 1 mV (apical side negative), 3.8 +/- 0.2 microA cm-2 and 3250 +/- 214 omega cm2 (mean +/- SEM, n = 75). Eighty two percent of the short circuit current was related to sodium absorption as shown by inhibition by apical amiloride (Km = 0.2 microM) and by basal ouabain (K1/2 = 0.3 microM). Amphotericin B (5-25 micrograms/ml) added to the apical bath increased Isc suggesting an apical rate-limiting step. Step by step replacement of choline by Na+ in a Na+-free medium resulted in a progressive increase in Vab and Isc with half maximal effect at 20 +/- 1 mM Na+. Thyrotropin (TSH) increased Isc and Vab in a biphasic way with a transient maximum after 5 min and a plateau after 20 min (about four times the basal level at 100 microU/ml TSH). This increase in sodium transport was also inhibited by apical amiloride. Thus, in culture, the thyroid cell monolayer behaves as a tight sodium absorbing epithelium controlled by TSH, with a rate limiting apical sodium channel as the entry mechanism and a basolateral Na+, K+-ATPase as the electromotive force.
