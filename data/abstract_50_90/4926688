Novobiocin-supersensitive (NS) mutants which could not grow on plates containing 40 mug or less of novobiocin per ml were isolated from Escherichia coli strain JE1011 (derived from E. coli K-12). Most of these NS mutants were found to have incomplete lipopolysaccharides (LPS), and they lack phosphate diester bridges in their backbone structure, with or without total loss of heptose, to which the phosphate diester is linked, and consequently lack external outer-core oligosaccharides. The phosphate diester bridges in the LPS backbone are apparently very important in forming a cell surface structure resistant to the penetration of antibiotics such as novobiocin, spiramycin, and actinomycin D. NS mutants, with incomplete LPS, lacking phosphates in their backbone structure were found to be resistant to phage T4, and those which also lacked heptose were resistant to phages T4 and T7. In contrast to the generally accepted idea that resistances to phages T3, T4, and T7 are linked genetically, no NS mutant was found to be resistant to T3. The possible structures of the receptors for T4 and T7 are discussed. The positions of novobiocin-supersensitive genes on the chromosome of several of the NS mutants defective in LPS were mapped. The genes were designated lpcA (between ara and lac) and lpcB (between 55 min and 60 min). The latter seemed to be a group of several related genes.
