Production of 5'-nucleotides by Serratia marcescens and Enterobacter liquefaciens correlates with deoxyribonuclease production, indicating the close relationship between these two organisms. To determine further relationships, susceptibilities of 279 strains of the tribe Klebsielleae were determined by the high-potency disc method, agar-dilution method, or both, by using 14 antibiotics. Ninety-seven per cent of S. marcescens (201 of 207 strains) and 100% of E. liquefaciens (17 strains) had minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 100 mug/ml or greater with colistin and polymyxin B. With these two antibiotics, 93% of other Enterobacter species (28 strains) had MIC values of less than 1.6 mug/ml, and 100% of Klebsiella (27 strains) had MIC values less than 1.6 mug/ml. Consistent patterns were not noted with the other antibiotics tested, but the results with colistin and polymyxin B provide additional evidence of the close relationship of S. marcescens and E. liquefaciens.
