It was shown for the first time that the antiviral drug bonafton administered orally to nonlinear albino mice in single doses of 5, 12.5 and 25 mg/kg induced production of interferon in the animal blood serum. The maximum interferon titer of 160-320 IU/ml was observed 18 hours after the drug administration in a dose of 12.5 mg/kg. In low doses of 5 to 12.5 mg/kg bonafton increased the nonspecific resistance of the mice to experimental viral infections when administered orally in single doses not earlier than 2 weeks prior to the contamination. The ability of the drug to stimulate the host protective forces probably plays a certain role in the mechanism of its therapeutic action in severe viral infections of man such as severe recurring ophthalmic herpes, genital herpes, Behcet's disease, Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome and others.
