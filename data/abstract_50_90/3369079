Resistance to benzimidazoles (BZs) in parasitic nematodes has recently been shown to be due to a reduction in the ability of BZs to bind the structural protein, tubulin, in resistant isolates. Based on these observations the development and standardisation of a routine diagnostic assay has been undertaken by measuring the binding of tritiated mebendazole to crude supernatants of L3 larvae. The assay is rapid, requiring less than 2 h, and is robust, highly reproducible and sensitive to minor changes in the resistance status of parasite populations. Investigation of the routine application and validity of this assay has been documented using 24 isolates of known resistance status from the species Haemonchus contortus, Trichostrongylus colubriformis and Ostertagia circumcincta: In all cases the observed binding and calculated susceptibility factors were in accordance with their respective resistance status.
