A nystatin-resistant mutant of Aspergillus niger has been isolated and used as a model system to study the effect of altered sterol levels on lipid composition, transport behavior and physical properties of membrane lipids. There is a decrease in the sterol to phospholipid ratio in the mutant compared to the wild type. Although there is no qualitative change in phospholipid composition, the mutant contains a higher amount of phosphatidylcholine and a lower amount of phosphatidylethanolamine compared to the wild type. The most significant change is the elevated level of linoleic acid in the mutant, concomitant with a decreased level of oleic acid. These adaptive changes to nystatin resistance are manifested in the altered thermotropic behavior of membrane lipids as studied by the steady-state fluorescence polarization technique. These changes are also associated with altered membrane permeability as evidenced by the change in Vmax values for uptake of some amino acids in the mutant compared to the wild type.
