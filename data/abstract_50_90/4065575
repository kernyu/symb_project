The cloning and expression of genes in Pseudomonas have been difficult, until now, due to the absence of vector systems that contain multiple restriction sites downstream from promoter sequences that are functional in Pseudomonas. We report here the construction of several broad-host-range vectors that can be utilized in either Pseudomonas or Escherichia coli and that rely on easily selectable antibiotic resistance markers with multiple cloning sites. These vectors were constructed by inserting the entire pUC13 sequence into derivatives of the RSF1010 wide-host-range plasmid. From this construction, other derivatives were obtained, specifically a lacZ::KmR fusion gene which provides an easily selectable marker in both E. coli and Pseudomonas. These vectors have been used to express the Pseudomonas putida cytochrome P450 monoxygenase gene in a P450-deficient P. putida strain. Thus, these vectors allow for the cloning, expression and selection of Pseudomonas genes in Pseudomonas by complementation.
