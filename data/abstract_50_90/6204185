Plasmids were constructed containing the regulatory regions and N-terminal portions of ermC and of ermD , fused in phase with the coding sequence of the Escherichia coli lacZ gene. ermC and ermD are erythromycin (Em) inducible macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B resistance elements derived from Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus licheniformis, respectively. The fusion plasmids were introduced into B. subtilis and used to study ermC and ermD regulation. In both cases, beta-galactosidase synthesis could be induced by low levels of Em. Induction was prevented by introduction of ole-2, a chromosomal mutation which decreases ribosomal affinity for Em. Induction also did not occur in the presence of intact copies of ermC , suggesting that prior or concomitant methylation of 23S rRNA, a treatment known to decrease ribosomal affinity for Em, was capable of interfering with ermC and ermD induction. These experiments are consistent with the translational attenuation model of ermC regulation, and together with other evidence, suggest that ermD is regulated by a similar mechanism.
