As a basis for the quantitation of the effect of anti-anaerobic drugs in vivo, an experimental thigh infection in mice was developed in which co-inoculation of Bacteroides fragilis and Escherichia coli is obligatory for proliferation of Bact. fragilis. The inhibitory effect of metronidazole and tinidazole on the proliferation of Bact. fragilis was assessed in this model. Both metronidazole and tinidazole showed a significant dose-effect relationship with respect to the outgrowth of Bact. fragilis but not that of E. coli. The effect of both drugs on Bact. fragilis was similar and at all dosage levels a significant correlation was found between the numbers of Bact. fragilis and E. coli.
