Minimal inhibitory concentration determinations and disk diffusion and Autobac 1 susceptibility tests were performed on 22 strains of Aeromonas hydrophila. Eleven of the strains had discrepancies between Autobac and disk diffusion or minimal inhibitory concentration results. These discrepancies occurred with the beta-lactam antibiotics, primarily carbenicillin and cephalothin. It is recommended that any strain of A. hydrophila found to be susceptible to any of the beta-lactam antibiotics by using Autobac 1 should be retested by a disk diffusion or minimal inhibitory concentration method.
