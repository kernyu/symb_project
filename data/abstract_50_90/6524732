Sixty-six Staphylococcus intermedius isolates from canine clinical specimens were tested for susceptibility to various antimicrobial agents by the Bauer-Kirby disk diffusion method and a commercial microdilution system. All isolates were susceptible to cephalothin, cloxacillin, gentamicin, methicillin, and vancomycin. Resistance to ampicillin, penicillin G, and tetracycline was frequent. There was an overall 87% agreement of results from the disk diffusion and microdilution methods for 10 antimicrobial agents. There was greater than or equal to 94% agreement between the 2 methods for 7 antimicrobics; discrepancies were minor.
