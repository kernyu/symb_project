Cephalexin remains an effective and highly useful antibiotic for the treatment of streptococcal and staphylococcal skin infections. Twelve years of experience have not diminished its efficacy, and cure rates of 90% or higher continue to be achieved. Its resistance to degradation by gastric acid and its uniform absorption ensure its bioavailability, and its efficacy in twice-daily dosages enhances medication compliance. The suspension formulation is well accepted by young children, and side effects have generally been mild and infrequent. Cephalexin is comparable to erythromycin, clindamycin, dicloxacillin, cloxacillin, and other cephalosporins in the treatment of streptococcal and staphylococcal infections. Because many of these antibiotics are similar in their efficacy, palatability, and adverse reactions, cost factors may play an important role in choosing one over the other. Penicillin remains the drug of choice for streptococcal skin infections. If the cure rates of the mixed streptococcal-staphylococcal lesions continue to decrease with penicillin, cephalexin and the other alternative antibiotics may assume a more important role in the primary treatment of these infections in the future.
