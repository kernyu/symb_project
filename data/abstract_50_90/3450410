Antimycin-resistant (AR) mutants of the yeast Kluyveromyces lactis, obtained either spontaneously or after manganese treatment, were isolated and genetically characterized. Most of the mutants obtained after manganese mutagenesis and two spontaneous mutants, tolerated high antimycin concentrations (more than 10 micrograms/ml) and were extrachromosomal. One mutant which grew only in low antimycin (1 microgram/ml) showed a Mendelian type of inheritance. The extrachromosomal mutants could be assigned to at least two genetic loci (ARI and ARII). Mutants representative of these two groups showed increased resistance to the antibiotic when the respiration of whole cells or mitochondria was studied. Extrachromosomal mutants of Saccharomyces cerevisiae resistant to antimycin were also induced with manganese, isolated and characterized. Comparative studies of the antimycin-resistant mutants of K. lactis and S. cerevisiae permitted the following observations: a) K. lactis is more resistant to antimycin, funiculosin, mucidin and diuron than S. cerevisiae, as are the AR mutants; b) K. lactis shows correlated sensitivity to funiculosin differing in this aspect from S. cerevisiae; c) the antimycin-resistant mutants of K. lactis belonging to group II (ARII) were also resistant to diuron, tolerating concentrations of more than 200 micrograms/ml; d) all extrachromosomal antimycin-resistant-mutants of S. cerevisiae and some of the AR mutants of K. lactis were more sensitive to mucidin than the wild type.
