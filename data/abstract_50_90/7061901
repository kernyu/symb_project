Experimental chemotherapy has been studying with choriocarcinoma in nude mice transplanted from drug resistant patients. The following results: 1) the combined therapy with MTX and ACD was not always effective and in place of one of them, the combination of CPM was effective 2) addition of VCR was effective; were obtained. These results were applied to two patients in clinic. 1) The first patient failed to obtain complete remission by the course of ACD, MTX + ACD, and MTX + ACD + CPM (MAC) therapy. Then the combination therapy with ACD + CPM made her HCG titer regressed to negative immediately. She is free from disease now. 2) The HCG titer and pulmonary metastasis of the second patient showed resistance to MAC therapy, CHAMOMA therapy, and the combined therapy with MTX. The combination chemotherapy with ACD + CPM + VCR made her HCG titer become to regressed and the pulmonary metastasis reduce to 1/4 in size. The clinical application of the results from experimental chemotherapy was defined to be possible. The experimental model will contribute to establish the schedule of the rational chemotherapy for drug-resistant choriocarcinoma.
