Urinary levels of antibiotics determine the outcome of treatment of most urinary tract infections. The antibacterial effect of gentamicin against Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in urine was studied. With use of urinary constituents in concentrations normally found in human urine, it was shown that urine has an inhibitory effect that is dependent upon the acidity and total osmolality of the urine, as well as upon the presence of individual solutes. Up to 40 times as much gentamicin may be needed to prevent the growth of E. coli or P. aeruginosa in concentrated, acidic human urine as is required in broth. This inhibitory effect may be particularly important when urinary concentrations of gentamicin are reduced either because of a reduction in dosage or because of decreased excretion due to renal insufficiency.
