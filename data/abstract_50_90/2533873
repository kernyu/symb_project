To improve our understanding of the bases of teicoplanin resistance we studied a "one-step" mutant of S. haemolyticus from a morphological point of view. The results show that the organization of peptidoglycan is altered in the resistant S. haemolyticus strain. It is suggested that the alterations, including the spongier cell wall structure, may prevent the teicoplanin from reaching its target.
