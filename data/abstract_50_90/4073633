Two experiments were done to evaluate the effectiveness of a slow-release, morantel tartrate, anthelmintic bolus for controlling parasitic gastroenteritis in replacement dairy heifers. In experiment 1, good control of nematode contamination of pasture was indicated by lower worm burdens in tracer calves that grazed with 15 heifers treated orally with a single bolus and by significantly decreased numbers of nematode eggs in the feces of the 15 treated heifers, as compared with numbers of eggs in the feces of 15 nontreated control calves. Significant differences in weight gain were not seen between treated and nontreated heifers, probably due to low amounts of larval exposure, the small number of heifers evaluated, and parasitic resistance in the heifers, which may have developed as a result of prestudy exposure to contaminated pasture. In experiment 2, done 1 year after the 1st experiment, using the same pastures that were used in experiment 1, young heifers were used. Many of the heifers were parasite naive at the beginning of the experiment (ie, nematode eggs were not found before the experiment). Treatment with the bolus was effective in controlling parasitic gastroenteritis in the heifers and in controlling nematode contamination of pasture. Compared with nontreated heifers, treated heifers had significantly higher cumulative weight gains, a significant decrease in plasma pepsinogen concentrations, and a significant decrease in worm egg excretion. The number of worms acquired by tracer calves that were grazed with treated heifers was significantly less than for tracer calves that were grazed with nontreated heifers.
