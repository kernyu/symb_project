The antitoxoplasm effects of cotrimoxazole (Ctx), spiramycin (Spir) and pyrimethamine-sulphadiazine (Pmm-Sdz) were compared during both proliferative and chronic phases of infection of mice with the Beverley (Bev) strain of Toxoplasma gondii of low virulence. The therapeutic efficacy of the drugs was determined according to the following criteria: (i) specific antibody response; (ii) acquired resistance to lethal challenge with the virulent RH strain of Toxoplasma; and (iii) persistence of parasites in tissues (brain, liver, spleen) of treated mice. The results indicated that Ctx, like Pmm-Sdz, had a greater effect than Spir upon toxoplasma organisms during the proliferative phase of infection. In contrast, none of the three drugs tested was active against tissue cysts in chronically infected mice.
