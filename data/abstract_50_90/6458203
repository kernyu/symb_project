Penicillinase-producing Neisseria gonorrhoeae (PPNG) causes the same clinical picture as nonpenicillinase-producing gonococci. Definitive identification depends on demonstration of penicillin resistance followed by tests for the beta-lactamase enzyme (penicillinase). Spectinomycin is the drug of choice but should be carefully reserved for laboratory-confirmed PPNG. Other drugs are effective. Over 2,000 cases have been reported since 1976, most originating in the Far East. Continuing spread is a certainty.
