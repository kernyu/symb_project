The in vitro activity of gentamicin was compared with its therapeutic efficacy in rabbits with Streptococcus faecalis endocarditis. The test strain was resistant to gentamicin as measured by MICs and MBCs determined in Mueller-Hinton broth alone or in broth supplemented with 50% rabbit serum. Gentamicin also failed to manifest anti-enterococcal activity when evaluated by time-kill studies in broth. However, the addition of serum to the medium did enhance the activity of gentamicin. In the therapy of experimental endocarditis, gentamicin used alone demonstrated anti-enterococcal activity equivalent to that of ampicillin used alone. Vegetation titers in animals treated with gentamicin alone were lower than those of untreated controls (P less than 0.01) and comparable to those in animals treated with ampicillin alone. Thus, gentamicin demonstrated anti-enterococcal activity in vivo despite the resistance observed in vitro, as measured by conventional assays to determine MICs and MBCs.
