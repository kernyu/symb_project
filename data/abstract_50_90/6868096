Pentamidine isethionate was found to be a very effective therapeutic agent in the treatment of pentavalent antimonial-resistant cases of kala-azar. Cardiotoxicity and metabolic disturbance (diabetes mellitus-like state) were found to be limiting factors in the use of this drug. Frequent clinical, electrocardiographic and biochemical observations are required during and after course of treatment and pentamidine treatment should be restricted to in-patients in hospitals.
