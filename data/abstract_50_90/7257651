It was the aim of this study to investigate the resistance status of germs isolated in environmental examinations and to compare them with results from hospitals. - In general practices a higher level of sensitive germs - mostly Staph. aureus - could be found. Besides multi-resistant gramnegative germs were also determined. A spreading of these resistant germs from hospital into general practices is possible and should receive more attention in general practice hygiene.
