Human liver DNA was transfected into CHO cells (mex-) along with pSV2gpt and colonies were selected first for resistance to mycophenolic acid and then to chloroethylnitrosourea. Transformants were obtained that contained approximately 10,000 molecules of O6-alkylguanine alkyltransferase (mex+) per cell. Their genome contained at least three copies of the human Alu sequence.
