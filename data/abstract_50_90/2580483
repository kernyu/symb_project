C3H/HeJ mice known to be defective in their responses to bacterial lipopolysaccharides, are more resistant to infection with herpes simplex virus (HSV) than the closely related strain C3HeB/FeJ. The increased resistance is reflected in higher early local interferon titers after HSV infection. However, NK cell activation by HSV is not correlated with resistance, since the NK cell response of C3H/HeJ mice was significantly lower than that of the control strain.
