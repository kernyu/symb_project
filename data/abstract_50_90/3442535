A collection of 185 isolates of 34 serovars of Salmonella from avian sources was examined for plasmids, drug resistance, biochemical properties, serum resistance, and virulence. No serovars other than S. enteritidis, S. typhimurium, and S. heidelberg showed evidence of serovar-associated plasmids. All S. enteritidis isolates carried a single plasmid of 36 Mdal and were resistant to guinea pig serum; one strain that was tested was virulent. Of 27 isolates of S. typhimurium, 11 possessed a 60-Mdal plasmid and 17 harbored a 2.3-Mdal plasmid. Among isolates of S. heidelberg, 21 of 24 carried a 2.2-Mdal plasmid. The only biochemical property that varied was fermentation of inositol, which tended to be related to serovar. Of 172 isolates, 54 were resistant to at least one drug. Multiple drug resistance was usually associated with R plasmids, and transmissible plasmids that encoded resistance to chloramphenicol and gentamicin were demonstrated. Of 117 isolates tested, 43 were resistant to guinea pig serum. Resistance appeared to be a characteristic of isolates rather than serovar and could not be related to plasmids. Twenty-five isolates highly resistant to guinea pig serum were all susceptible to the bactericidal action of chicken serum. In tests for virulence using intraperitoneally (i.p.) and orally inoculated Balb/c mice and day-old chicks, only i.p.-inoculated chicks proved useful in demonstrating large differences among isolates: LD50's ranged from 10(0) to 10(8).
