The in-vitro activity of cefotaxime and cefoperazone were compared using clinically isolated Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Cefotaxime was found on a weight to weight basis, to be much more active than cefoperazone. All the three species studied show the presence of cefoperazone-resistant population which were sensitive to cefotaxime. The possible mechanisms of resistance to these antibiotics were discussed.
