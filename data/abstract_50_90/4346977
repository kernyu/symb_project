Cholera-like vibrios examined by pyrolysis gas-liquid chromatography could be distinguished from other common aerobic gram-negative bacilli, including oxidase-positive organisms, e.g., Aeromonas. Vibrios in Heiberg group I were subdivided into three types on the basis of differences in one complex in the chromatogram, and these closely corresponded with the identification as classical, El Tor, or "intermediate" biotypes of Vibrio cholerae by conventional methods.
