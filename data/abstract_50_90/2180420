Macrolides, lincosamides, tetracyclines and chloramphenicol are structurally unrelated antibiotics which share protein synthesis inhibition as their common mechanism of action. Despite their individual differences, they can all be considered broad spectrum antibiotics with practical use for a wide variety of infections. Due to their similarities in function, however, concurrent or sequential administration of these agents must be undertaken with caution in order to prevent antagonism and induction of bacterial resistance. Full understanding of their function and potential interactions are, therefore, important. Indications, interactions, mechanisms of function, side effects and contraindications are fully discussed.
