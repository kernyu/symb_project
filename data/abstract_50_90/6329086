The susceptibilities to erythromycin, rifampin, polymyxin B, ampicillin, tetracycline, gentamicin, fusidic acid, trimethoprim, and spectinomycin of five virulent phase I strains of Bordetella pertussis and their degraded phase IV descendants were compared. Increases in MICs of 2- to 16-fold were observed for erythromycin, rifampin, tetracycline, fusidic acid, trimethoprim, and spectinomycin for four of the five degraded strains.
