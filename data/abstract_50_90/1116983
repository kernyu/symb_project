A system of genetic recombination in Nocardia mediterranei ATCC 13685 is described. This strain produces a mixture of several rifamycin antibiotics. Using haploid recombinant selection and analysis procedures similar to those applied to Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2), 14 auxotrophic markers and 1 streptomycin resistance marker were located on a circular linkage map. The linkage map of N. mediterranei seems to be similar to that of S. coelicolor A3(2).
