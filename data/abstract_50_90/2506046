The emergence of resistance to lomefloxacin, norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin was investigated in nalidixic acid sensitive and resistant urinary isolates by continuous turbidimetry. A decline in susceptibility was observed after a single exposure to each of the drugs, and further increments of resistance occurred during three sequential passages. Variants resistant to one quinolone were cross-resistant to the others. The level of resistance selected by norfloxacin in three of the five test strains was greater than that observed with lomefloxacin or ciprofloxacin. In experiments in a model of the treatment of bacterial cystitis, concentrations of lomefloxacin well within those readily achievable in urine suppressed growth of nalidixic acid sensitive and resistant strains for more than 20 h without causing any decline in susceptibility of surviving bacteria.
