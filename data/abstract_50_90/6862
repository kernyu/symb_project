In a 14 months period, as from March 1973 to April 1974 468 cases of acute bacterial meningitis have been diagnosed by C.S.F. findings; namely by examining the protein and sugar content, by the cell counts, Gram's staining and culturing of the sediments of C.S.F. 188 cases were proven by culturing to be meningococcic meningitis. All these cases are from the families living in suburban areas of the city under crowded circumstances, which show the importance of population density in the epidemiology of this particular disease.
