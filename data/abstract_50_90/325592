Fourteen patients with infections caused by Serratia marcescens were seen over an eight-month period in a large general hospital. Predisposing factors suggested an 'opportunistic' pattern similar to that previously described in the United States. S. marcescens is an important pathogen which may be increasing in significance in the United Kingdom. Multiple resistance of the organism to antibiotics other than gentamicin makes the finding of apparent sensitivity to co-trimoxazole of potential therapeutic value.
