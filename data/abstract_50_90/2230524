We report a case of invasive disease caused by penicillin resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. The prevalence of penicillin and multiple drug resistant pneumococcal strains is increasing worldwide. We must assume that the incidence of clinically significant illness caused by these agents will also increase. Based on this assumption, we make suggestions as to how clinicians should alter their therapeutic approach to pneumococcal illness.
