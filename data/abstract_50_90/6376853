Fundamental and clinical studies of ceftazidime (CAZ) were performed, and the following results were obtained. MICs of CAZ for E. coli which was recently isolated from patients, were less than 1.56 microgram/ml and that for K. oxytoca were less than 0.39 micrograms/ml, and that for Salmonella were less than 0.39 microgram/ml, and that for B. pertussis were less than 0.20 microgram/ml. The mean serum levels after the drip infusion at the doses of 20 to 36 mg/kg for 30 to 60 minutes were between 11.8 and 66.7 micrograms/ml at 1 hour, and the mean half-lives (T 1/2) were between 58 and 105 minutes, and the excretion rates in urine up to 6 hours were between 86.3 and 96.5%. CAZ was given to 35 pediatric patients (include 2 drop cases) by intravenous injection for 4 to 10 days, and the total dosage was between 2.4 and 14.5 g. Thirty-three patients with acute respiratory tract infections, pertussis and acute urinary tract infections with ABPC-resistant E. coli were treated with CAZ by intravenous injection or drip infusion. The efficacy rate of excellent + good was 90.9% (30 cases/33 cases) and the efficacy rate of excellent + good + fair was 100%. The daily doses of CAZ were 50 to 110 mg/kg, given in 2 or 3 divided doses per day. S. pyogenes, S. aureus, H. influenzae, B. pertussis and ABPC-resistant E. coli were isolated from the culture of sputum or urine in the patients, and they were all eradicated by treatment with CAZ. No side effect was observed except for temporary eosinophilia in 2 cases and temporary platelets increased in 1 case.
