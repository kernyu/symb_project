DNA transfection in mouse L-cells was performed by means of the electropermeabilization technique (U. Zimmermann, G. Pilwat, and F. Riemann, Z. Naturforsch. 29, 304 (1974)). The plasmid pSV 2-neo used leads to neomycin-resistance in stably transfected L-cells. Optimized conditions resulted in high yields of clones at relatively low DNA concentration. The influence of temperature during pulse application and during the subsequent resealing process as well as the field parameters and medium composition are discussed.
