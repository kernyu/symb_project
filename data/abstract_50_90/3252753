The in vitro activities of several 14-, 15- and 16-membered macrolides were compared with that of erythromycin. In general, 14-membered macrolides such as erythromycin, clarithromycin, and flurithromycin were more active against streptococci and Bordetella pertussis than was the 15-membered macrolide azithromycin, which was more active than 16-membered macrolides such as miocamycin and rokitamycin. Clarithromycin was the most active compound against Streptococcus pyogenes, pneumococci, Listeria monocytogenes, and Corynebacterium species. Legionella pneumophila was most susceptible to miocamycin, clarithromycin, and rokitamycin. Branhamella catarrhalis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Haemophilus influenzae were most susceptible to azithromycin. Azithromycin and dirithromycin were the most active compounds against Campylobacter jejuni. MICs of 16-membered macrolides for strains expressing inducible-type resistance to erythromycin were less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml, whereas none of the compounds had activity against strains expressing constitutive-type resistance. The MICs of roxithromycin, miocamycin, rokitamycin, and josamycin increased in the presence of human serum, whereas MICs of the other compounds either were unchanged or decreased.
