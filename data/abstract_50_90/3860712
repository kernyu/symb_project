Two clones of N. tabacum, transformed to kanamycin resistance by direct transfer to protoplasts of a hybrid gene, consisting of the protein coding region from the bacterial gene for aminoglycoside phosphotransferase under the control of 5'/3' expression signals from cauliflower mosaic virus gene VI, in the bacterial plasmid pUC8, have been subjected to a detailed genetic crossing analysis accompanied by Southern blot analysis and enzyme activity assays of representative offspring. The genetic data obtained from large populations of R1/F1 and R2/F2 offspring as well as from more than 20 subclones of each of the original of the hybrid gene was stably integrated into chromosomal DNA of the original transformants, (b) that the gene normally was stably maintained during clonal proliferation, (c) that normally it is transmitted in a regular fashion (with exceptions) to sexual offspring, and (d) that it is inherited as a single dominant trait. Data from DNA hybridisation and enzyme assays confirm this interpretation. The functional gene is integrated together with several non-functional copies and bacterial plasmid sequences, which are inherited as one block together with the functional gene.
