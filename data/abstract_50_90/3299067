The nature of the lethal effect of antimicrobial drug dioxidin was studied. The treatment of bacterial cells by dioxidin results in an instant repression of DNA synthesis and formation of single strand gaps in DNA molecule. The repair of single strand gaps in polA+ cells involves the DNA polymerase I. The deficit of this enzyme leads to the increased degradation of DNA. The products of the recA, polA1, lexA, recB are relevant for bacterial resistance to dioxidin while the products of uvrA, uvrE and recF genes are not. On the basis of the obtained data dioxidin may be defined as a "gamma-type" agent due to the nature of dioxidin-induced lesions in DNA and their repair.
