A standardizing by means of determination of the pyocine sensitivity could be achieved on the basis of 200 strains of P. aeruginosa which had been isolated out of clinical material. It was analyzed semiquantitatively by using a step-scale in five parts. The identical or in a high degree corresponding strains according to the pyocine sensitivity could be registered on the example of the isolated strains of a intensive-care unit by the calculation of the Q-correlation coefficient according to the Q-technique as well as by the determination of the differences in the single reactions using a standardized measure of distance. The epidemiological connexion resulting from that is discussed.
