It was shown that E. coli C, E. coli MRE 600 DNA, and also plasmid DNA of Col E1, RSF 2124 from E. coli K-12, and plasmid DNA from E. coli MRE 600 were completely resistant against restriction endonuclease R. Eco RII. Plasmid DNAs of Col E1, RSF 2124 amplificated for 4 hours in the presence of chloramphenicol are sensitive to R. Eco RII but after 16-hour amplification in the presence of chloramphenicol these DNAs acquire complete resistance against R. Eco RII. These data point to the slower rate of modification of DNA in vivo by DC-methylases of Eco RII type in comparison with DNA methylase Eco RII.
