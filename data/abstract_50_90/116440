In a collaborative study on a new quantitative suspension test for the evaluation of the bactericidal activity of chemical disinfectants, three laboratories performed the in vitro test on a phenol and an aldehyde standard in the critical use dilutions using Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa as test organisms. The most striking finding was that the means of the germidical effect of one laboratory were significant lower than those of both others. Nevertheless the dispersion of the results did not differ among the laboratories. The differences could not be attributed to the subculture technique followed, nor to the daily inconstancy of the bacterial suspension resistance. The only feature that could explain the difference was the assessment of the microbiological work in itself. It should be stated, however, that the variance of the germicidal-effect values were rather low for this kind of microbiological work, so that differences between laboratories were significant even if the absolute values differed less than 1 unit.
