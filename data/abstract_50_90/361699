The DNA hybridization procedure of Southern has been used to search for homology between the transposable kanamycin resistance determinant Tn5 and sequences in the chromosome of Escherichia coli K-12. No homology was detected under conditions in which a segment homologous to 5% or more of the 5,300-base pair Tn5 element would have been seen.
