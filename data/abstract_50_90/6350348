Ceftazidime is a wide-spectrum, beta-lactamase-stable cephalosporin with remarkable potency against Pseudomonas spp., Enterobacteriaceae, and some gram-positive species. The reevaluation of the 30-micrograms ceftazidime disk diffusion tests with commercially prepared disks confirms the proposed susceptibility breakpoint zone of greater than or equal to 17 mm (minimal inhibitory concentration correlate, less than or equal to 8.0 micrograms/ml) and the resistance breakpoint zone of less than or equal to 13 mm (minimal inhibitory concentration correlate, greater than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml). Major and minor interpretive errors were only 4.4%, and these errors could be further reduced to 1.1% by not testing gram-positive organisms, particularly enterococci and Staphylococcus spp. On the basis of the results from a multilaboratory quality control study, the following zone diameter quality control guidelines are suggested: Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, 27 to 31 mm; Staphylococcus aureus, ATCC 25923, 16 to 20 mm; Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, 24 to 28 mm.
