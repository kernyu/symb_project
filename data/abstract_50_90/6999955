Among 150 strains of Salmonella of various serotypes and from different origins, 64 are resistant to K2TeO3 10(-4) M. In these strains Te resistance always coded by R plasmids which are members of the H incompatibility group. This type of plasmids are very easy to detect and to identify. We suggest that resistance to Te should be examined routinely for Salmonella.
