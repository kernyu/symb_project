The effectiveness of ticarcillin (one 6 g dose at the start of the operation) and cephalothin (three 2 g doses given at 4 hour intervals from the start of the operation) as prophylactic antibiotics in operations on the colon, stomach, small bowel or obstructed biliary tract was determined in a prospective, randomized, blind study of 190 patients. Data from the 152 patients forming the definitive study revealed a significant reduction in the rate of wound and peritoneal infections with the use of ticarcillin (3.4 percent) and cephalothin (5.3 percent) over that with the use of a placebo (27.8 percent). Cultures showed no evidence of antibiotic resistance in the contaminant organisms of patients who later developed infections. Both antibiotic regimens offered excellent protection against infection after gastrointestinal operations; neither produced untoward side effects. The very short duration of treatment, particularly with ticarcillin, conferred the additional benefits of low cost, simplicity of drug administration, and negligible risk of the emergence of resistant bacterial strains.
