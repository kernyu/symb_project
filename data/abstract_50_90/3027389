We investigated the effects of acyclovir and 9-(1,3-dihydroxy-2-propoxymethyl)guanine (DHPG) on a lymphoblastoid cell line dually infected with Epstein-Barr virus and herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 1. The numbers of Epstein-Barr virus genomes were reduced during 70 days of treatment with either drug. Both drugs suppressed HSV replication in a dose-related manner. In the continued presence of the drugs, HSV developed resistance, rapidly to acyclovir and much more slowly to 30 microM DHPG. Analysis of HSV glycoprotein C production and viral DNA showed that treatment with 100 microM DHPG eliminated HSV production, curing the cell line of HSV persistent infection.
