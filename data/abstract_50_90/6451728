Studies in the pediatric field on cefoperazone (CPZ), a newly synthesized broad spectrum cephalosporin, were carried out, and the following results were obtained. 1) In 3 infants, the concentration of CPZ was measured after intravenous instillation. The blood concentrations were maintained at the high level for a long time and the measurable amount of blood levels were detected for 8 hours after the end of injection. The excretion rates in urine for 12 hours after the end of drip infusion were distributed between 34.2 approximately 56.1%. 2) Twenty-three patients with respiratory tract infections, 8 patients with enteritis, 4 patients with urinary tract infections, 3 patients with meningitis, 1 patient with sepsis and 4 patients with other infections were administered CPZ mainly by intravenous instillation. 3) Any effect on hepatic or renal function was not observed. 4) Clinical response obtained in these cases was excellent in 33 cases (82.5%), good in 7 cases (17.5%), and none of poor case.
