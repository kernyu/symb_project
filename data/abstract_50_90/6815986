Two patients are presented with a primary resistant BT leprosy. Diagnosis was made on a clinical base: luck of improvement under supervised sulfone treatment and quick regression of the lesions under a short course of rifampicine (8 weekly doses). The two children lived together with their lepromatous mothers who are suspected of DDS resistance. Where secondary DDS resistance is found only in multibacillary leprosy, primary resistance shows up in all clinical forms of leprosy.
