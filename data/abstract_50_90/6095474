Isolates of Neisseria gonorrhoeae from 150 patients attending a venereal disease clinic were examined for their susceptibility to four antibiotics (norfloxacin, cefotaxime, cefuroxime, and erythromycin) by a plate-dilution method. The isolates were also characterized by gonococcal auxotyping. The most frequent auxotypes were nonrequiring, 50%; Pro-, 16.7%; Pro-, Arg-, (Orn*), Ura-, 10.7%; Arg-, Hyx-, Ura-, 12.7%; and a miscellaneous group consisting of 10% of the isolates. Norfloxacin was the most active of the antibiotics; all of the isolates were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.06 microgram/ml. The Arg-, Hyx-, Ura- group of isolates was the most susceptible of the auxotypes to antibiotics. In the present study N. gonorrhoeae of the Arg-, Hyx-, Ura- auxotype fell into two groups with respect to erythromycin, one highly susceptible and one less susceptible. The results of the present study provide further evidence that the nutritional requirements of gonococci are associated with their response to certain antibiotics.
