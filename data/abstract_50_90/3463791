The MK-0787/MK-0791 is a combination of imipenem (a carbapenem antibiotic) and cilastatin sodium (a dehydro peptidase-I inhibitor) in a 1 to 1 ratio, which produces a higher urinary recovery of imipenem than imipenem alone. The MK-0787/MK-0791 was used in 8 female patients with intrapelvic infections. Clinical efficacies were very good in all the patients. There were neither subjective nor objective side effects nor abnormal laboratory findings.
