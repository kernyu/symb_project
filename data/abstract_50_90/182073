Two alleles for viomycin-capreomycin resistance (vic) in Mycobacterium smegmatis affect ribosome structures. One (vicA) affects a component of 50S subunits and the other (vicB) affects a component of 30S subunits. The locus for neomycin-kanamycin resistance (nek), which is linked to vicA and vicB, affects a component of 30S subunits. Although the erythromycin resistance locus (ery) is linked to vic and nek, no ribosomal alterations could be detected. Mutations at the streptomycin locus (str) not linked to vic and nek caused alterations of 30S subunits.
