Opportunistic microorganisms with multiple drug resistance are the main causative agents of infectious complications in oncological patients. The spectrum of the causative agents and their antibiotic sensitivity change with introduction of new drugs. This requires constant control over the composition of the causative agents and their sensitivity. Such a control provides rational antibacterial therapy when the causative agent is in virtue of some reasons unknown or the bacteriological data are not available. The prophylactic use of antibacterial drugs is of limited value, largely in operations on the gastrointestinal tract and other naturally contaminated cavities.
