The substrate specificity of aminoglycoside phosphotransferases isolated from 3 strain of E. coli and purified was studied. All pure enzymes phosphorilated neomycin, paromomycin, lividomycin, neamine, ribostamycin, kanamycins A and B. Only ATP was the donor of the phosphate groups in these reactions, while in the non-purified extracts GTP but not UTP or CTP served as the donor of the phosphate group for inactivation of neomycin. The substrate specificity indicated that the above enzymes were aminoglycoside-3(1)-phosphotransferases. Inactivation of neomycin with the use of the phosphate group of phosphoenolpiruvate as the donor in the non-purified enzymatic preparations of the neomycin-resistant strains of E. coli and Pseudomonas was not observed.
