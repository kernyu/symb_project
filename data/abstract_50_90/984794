Susceptibility tests with aminoglycosides against Staphylococcus aureus have revealed discrepancies between the minimal inhibitory concentrations and the minimal bactericidal concentrations. To further evaluate these discrepancies, kill curves were performed against a susceptible strain of S. aureus with five different aminoglycosides (amikacin, kanamycin, tobramycin, gentamicin, sisomicin) at concentrations up to 16-fold above the minimal inhibitory concentration. Results revealed the presence of small subpopulations of cells capable of growth within 24 h in concentrations of aminoglycoside up to eightfold above the minimal inhibitory concentration for the parent strain. These subpopulations occurred at a frequency of >/=10(-7) parent cells, were not physiologically different from the susceptible parent strains, and were present in approximately one-half of 30 strains of S. aureus tested. The resistance of these subpopulations was approximately eightfold higher than that of the parent for all five aminoglycosides and was independent of concentration or type of aminoglycoside used to select them. This resistance was not due to extracellular degradation of drug and was stable over eight transfers in drug-free medium, except when selected by gentamicin or sisomicin.
