The efficacy of antibiotic resistance (barrier) precautions for control of aminoglycoside resistance was evaluated from 1978 to 1981. Despite increasing aminoglycoside use and a 13-fold increase in aminoglycoside-resistant isolates on a newly opened oncology unit, the hospital-wide frequency of aminoglycoside resistant Enterobacteriaceae remained low, supporting the continued value of barrier precautions which were initiated in our hospital in 1974. This control enabled us to focus on exceptions to the effectiveness of barrier precautions. These were traced to environmental reservoirs, very chronic and heavily infected patients, asymptomatic carriers of Serratia, and oncology patients receiving oral non-absorbable aminoglycosides. In addition, resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa paralleled aminoglycoside use and, as in our prior experience, continued to rise. With increasing adoption of barrier precautions by others such exceptions should be anticipated.
