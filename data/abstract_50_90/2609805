Staphylococcus hyicus-cultures, isolated from piglets and cattle with skin lesions were investigated for their plasmid content and their resistance to antimicrobial agents and heavy metals. Several plasmids of different sizes could be detected in most of the 32 "porcine" S. hyicus-isolates, whereas none of the 20 "bovine" S. hyicus-cultures possessed any plasmid. The "porcine" S. hyicus-isolates were much more resistant to antimicrobial substances than the "bovine" S. hyicus-cultures. However, the "porcine" and "bovine" S. hyicus-cultures did not differ in their resistance to heavy metals.
