A study was made of the actual status of urinary tract infection induced by Serratia marcescens on a total of 88 patients who were admitted to our University Hospital in 1981 approximately 1982, and in whose urines not less than 10(4)/ml of S. marcescens were found. An investigation into the background factors of these patients revealed that indwelling catheter, operation for malignancy and use of antibiotics were the major factors responsible for the infection. S. marcescens was found to coexist with P. aeruginosa in not a few cases. The pathogens were highly susceptible to ST compound preparations, DKB and GM, and the pathogens in only 7 of the patients were tolerant to all of these antibiotics. None of the patients died of S. marcescens infection.
