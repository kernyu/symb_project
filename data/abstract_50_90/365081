Analysis of 53 antibiotic resistant clinical strains of E. coli isolated from patients with various purulent inflammatory diseases is presented. According to the data of the electrophoretic study 83 per cent of them carried 2 to 6 plasmids. Thirteen of them carried the conjugation R-factor. The antibiotic resistance in the other strains was due to the non-conjugation plasmids.
