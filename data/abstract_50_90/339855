Fourteen patients infected with falciparum malaria admitted to the Hospital for Tropical Diseases in Bangkok, Faculty of Tropical Medicine, Mahidol University, were studied. In vivo and in vitro methods were used to compare the effects of chloroquine on Plasmodium falciparum. The results showed that RI in vivo corresponded to samples containing chloroquine base 2.5-3.5 millimicromoles per ml of blood in vitro and RII in vivo corresponded to samples with chloroquine base of 4.0 millimicromoles per ml of blood.
