Cefaclor (CCL) is a cephem antibiotic for oral use. Thirty cases of infection of oral regions, in the First Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, School of Dentistry, the University of Tokushima, were treated with CCL at 750 mg/day. The results were as follows: The efficacy rate for all kinds of diseases was 80.0% in 3 days and 96.7% in 5 days and 86.7% as an overall assessment by the patients' doctors. With regard to the degree of symptoms, the efficacy rate for cases with moderate symptoms was less than that for mild cases in 3 days and according to the assessment by the patients' doctors. Some moderate cases required increased medication because no beneficial effect was observed. In sensitivity tests, CCL was shown to be effective on all 27 isolated clones of bacteria tested. CCL caused no detectable changes in laboratory data. No side effects were observed in any case. From these results, it is concluded that CCL is a highly effective antibiotic for use on infections of the oral regions.
