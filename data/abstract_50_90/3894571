Mercury volatilization (Hg2+ reductase) activity has been found with Hg2+-resistant isolates of three Streptomyces species and with three Hg2+-resistant strains of group B Streptococcus from clinical sources in Japan. Hg2+ reductase activities in crude cell extracts showed the temperature sensitivity, the requirement for an added thiol compound and the characteristic dependence on NAD(P)H cofactors of similar enzymes isolated from other bacteria.
