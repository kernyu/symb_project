With L-15 as the base medium, drug-resistant variants were isolated from two amphibian tissue culture strains: the Xenopus laevis A8 diploid cell line and the ICR 2A cell line of Rana pipiens. Four different classes of variants were obtained: (1) A8 cells resistant to chloramphenicol, an inhibitor of mitochondrial protein synthesis; (2) A8 cells resistant to ouabain, an inhibitor of the Na+/K+-activated ATPase of the plasma membrane;(3) ICR 2A cells resistant to low (20 microgram/ml) and high (300 microgram/ml) levels of bromodeoxyuridine (BUdR), a thymidine analog which interferes with the pyrimidine salvage pathway; and (4) ICR 2A cells resistant to 2,6-diaminopurine (DAP), an adenine analog which interferes with the purine salvage pathway. Unlike the other variants, isolation of BUdR resistant cells is a 2-step process. Resistance to low levels of BUdR is phenotypically expressed by a reduction in thymidine transport activities while resistance to high levels of this compound is evidenced by greatly reduced levels of thymidine kinase activity. DAP-resistant cells, which are characterized by reduced levels of adenine phosphoribosyl transferase (APRT) activity, do not die in AAT (adenine, aminopterin, thymidine) selection medium. This suggests that these cells utilize adenine efficiently. With MEM as the base medium, an asparagine independent clone was isolated from the ICR 2A cell line. When compared with the wild type, this variant exhibited a slightly reduced growth rate in the presence or absence of asparagine.
