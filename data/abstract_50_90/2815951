In 1983 we started our statistical control for postoperative infections. The data are checked every half year. Most common bacteria was Staph. aureus followed by Staph. epidermidis. We found a difference in the spectrum of bacteria between our postop. patients and the referred cases. A surgeon related control and our new operating theatres reduced the infection rate from 2.2% to 0.8%. For our total joint replacements we additionally used perioperative antibiotics. The change in the antibiotic from Cefoxitine to Cefacedone reduced the infection rate from 4.7% to 0.8%. The permanent control of bacteria and of their resistance to antibiotics allows us to reduce the number of drugs used and to simplify treatment without loosing efficiency of therapy. This is--in a double sense--a good way for reducing costs.
