BRL 17421 is a new semisynthetic beta-lactam antibiotic with an unusual spectrum of antibacterial activity. The compound exhibits exceptional stability to a wide range of bacterial beta-lactamases and is active against the majority of Enterobacteriaceae, including strains highly resistant to many of the penicillins and cephalosporins currently available. Among the clinical isolates of Enterobacteriaceae tested, the frequency of strains resistant to BRL 17421 was found to be low, and there was a slow rate of emergence of resistance during in vitro studies. BRL 17421 was highly active against Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, including beta-lactamase-producing strains. The compound was markedly less active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Bacteroides fragilis than against the Enterobacteriaceae. Against the gram-positive bacteria, BRL 17421 showed a very low level of activity. BRL 17421 was found to be 85% bound to human serum, and the antibacterial activity was diminished two- to fourfold in the presence of human serum. Against experimental infections in mice, the activity of BRL 17421 reflected the properties observed in vitro. Studies in human volunteers showed unusually high and prolonged serum concentrations of the compound after parenteral dosage, with a serum half-life of about 5 h, and approximately 85% of the dose was recovered unchanged in the urine. BRL 17421 was poorly absorbed after oral administration. The compound was well tolerated after intramuscular and intravenous administration in volunteers, with no adverse side effects.
