Erythromycin-producing strains of S. erythraeus were characterized with respect to formation of spontaneous and induced rifampicin-resistant mutants. It was shown that the frequency of spontaneous rifampicin-resistant mutants formed by various strains amounted to 0.9.10(-8) = 9.1.10(-7). In some events the exposure to nitrosoguanidine increased the frequency of such mutants by 2 orders of magnitude. The rifampicin-resistant mutants differed in antibiotic resistance. It was found that a significant part of the rifampicin-resistant mutants became sensitive to heating (19.1 per cent) and lost the ability to form aeromycelium (21.8 per cent).
