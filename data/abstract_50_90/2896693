Resistance rates of various species to many antimicrobials are very high in Greece. Mean resistance rates of Staphylococcus aureus isolated in 12 Athens hospitals in the second half of 1986 were 80% for penicillin, 32% for methicillin, 22% for gentamicin, 27% for erythromycin, 17% for lincomycin and 16% for co-trimoxazole. In a prospective study in the General Hospital of Athens from May to July 1987, 40 coagulase-positive staphylococcal strains were isolated from various materials from inpatients. Of these 78% were resistant to penicillin, 50% to methicillin at 37 degrees C, 62% to methicillin at 30 degrees C, 38% to erythromycin, 32% to tobramycin, 15% to clindamycin, 15% to fusidic acid, 9% to amikacin, 5% to netilmicin and 0% to vancomycin. Ten of these strains (seven methicillin-resistant) were responsible for severe infections and three of the affected patients died (two nosocomial pneumonias, one infected burn, all due to methicillin-resistant strains). Another 11 strains (eight methicillin-resistant) were responsible for mild infections. From 41 coagulase-negative staphylococci isolated from inpatients, seven (five methicillin-resistant) were held responsible for mild infections. Of the 20 patients with infections due to methicillin-resistant strains, nine had previously received a beta- lactam antibiotic. Staphylococci are not responsible, however, for a large proportion of infections in our hospital at the moment. High resistance rates in Greece are due to overuse of antibiotics, a phenomenon attributed to a consumer's society behaviour of doctors and patients.
