A heat-inactivated rough mutant of B. abortus increased resistance to a transplantable lymphoma when cultured on solid agar (ag) but not when cultured on a fluid medium (fl). The ag organisms were smaller, more toxic and induced more interferon 2 h after injection than fl. They also contained a phospholipid (cardiolipin) absent from fl preparations.
