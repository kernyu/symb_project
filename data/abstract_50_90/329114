Two cytoplasmic, glucosamine resistant (GR) mutants of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, GR6 and GR10, were crossed to strains bearing known mitochondrial markers. Analysis of vegetative and meiotic segregation patterns in these crosses suggested that the glucosamine resistance conferring factor did not reside on mitDNA. This was confirmed by ethidium bromide treatments which completely abolished oligomycin resistance due to a mitochondrial mutation at the OL12 locus but which failed to eliminate the GR factor present in the same strain. Comparison of GR6 and GR10 to some other known cytoplasmic determinants suggested that while glucosamine resistance is not related to the killer plasmid it may be allelic to the URE3 determinant and/or to the PSI factor.
