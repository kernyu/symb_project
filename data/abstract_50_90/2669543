The drug susceptibility of 70 isolates of Plasmodium falciparum to standard and experimental antimalarials was evaluated using a radioisotope microdilution method. All isolates were from forest fringe dwelling Orang Asli, the aborigines of Peninsular Malaysia. The geometric mean IC50 values were: chloroquine, 10 ng/ml; amodiaquine, 4.7 ng/ml; mefloquine, 2.8 ng/ml; quinine, 40.5 ng/ml; halofantrine, 1.5 ng/ml; enpiroline, 3 ng/ml; and pyrimethamine, 21 ng/ml. Four isolates exhibited decreased susceptibility to chloroquine (IC50 greater than 60 ng/ml), and one exhibited decreased susceptibility to quinine (IC50 = 161 ng/ml). Three isolates showed decreased susceptibility to mefloquine (IC50 = 10-11 ng/ml). The lack of drug pressure may account for the high prevalence of P. falciparum isolates susceptible to chloroquine.
