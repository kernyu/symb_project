494 persons with various purulent inflammatory diseases were examined. Gram-negative nitrofuran resistant organisms isolated from the clinical material were found in 22.9 per cent of the cases. Representatives of Enterobacteriaceae, Klebsiella-Enterobacter-Serratia (26.8 per cent), Proteus-Providencia (16.8 per cent) and E. coli-Arizona-Citrobacter (16.1 per cent) predominated. Pseudomonas (32.1 per cent) and Acinetobacter (5.3 per cent) predominated among the aerobic gram-negative bacteria. Sensitivity of 131 strains to 10 chemotherapeutic drugs was determined. 60.4 per cent of the aerobic and 44.2 per cent of the Coli bacteria had multiple drug resistance (to 5 and more drugs). The organisms isolated from the urine and wound excretion were most resistant. Representatives of Pseudomonas and Klebsiella-Enterobacter predominated among the polyresistant cultures. High sensitivity of the isolates to gentamicin, carbenicillin and nalidixic acid was noted.
