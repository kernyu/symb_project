Tests with 2,713 bacterial isolates (members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and gram-positive cocci) from 14 laboratories compared cefoxitin MICs with cefotetan MICs. Strains that were susceptible to cefoxitin could be assumed to be susceptible to cefotetan. Over half of the cefoxitin-resistant isolates of the Enterobacteriaceae were susceptible to cefotetan.
