Transfer of the broad-host-range resistance plasmid pIP501 from Streptococcus faecalis to Pediococcus pentosaceus and Pediococcus acidilactici occurred between cells immobilized on nitrocellulose filters in the presence of DNase. Expression of the pIP501-linked erythromycin and chloramphenicol resistance determinants was observed in transconjugants. Intrageneric transfer of pIP501 from a P. pentosaceus donor to various pediococcal recipients occurred at frequencies of 10(-4) to 10(-7) transconjugants per input donor cell. Intergeneric transfer of plasmid pIP501 from P. pentosaceus to S. faecalis, Streptococcus sanguis (Challis), and Streptococcus lactis was observed. Similar mating experiments showed no evidence for the transfer of the broad-host-range R-plasmid pAM beta 1 to Pediococcus spp. recipients.
