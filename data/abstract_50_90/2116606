The study was conducted on patients with initially diagnosed tuberculosis encountered in 1986-87. A series of 269 bacterial antibiograms performed on sputum [correction of excreate] and other materials was examined in order to ascertain the resistance of Koch's bacillus to R/AMP, INH, SM and EMB. Primary drug resistance was found in 64 cases (23.79% of the total) and was isolated in 32 (11.89%), multiple in the rest. The response to the individual antibiotics was a follows resistance to INH was isolated in 11 cases (4.08%), combined with resistance to other drugs in 27 (10.03%); resistance to SM was isolated in 13 cases (4.81%) multiple in 24 (8.92%); resistance to R/AMP was isolated in 4 cases (1.48%), multiple in 14 (5.2%); resistance to EMB was isolated in 4 (1.48%) multiple in 19 (7.06%). Comparison with earlier studies in the Turin area highlights that the incidence of TB, in decline up to 1979, significantly increased in the period considered.
