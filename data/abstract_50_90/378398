The sequences of insertions of the translocatable tetracycline-resistance element Tn10 into the repressor (cl) gene of bacteriophage lambda have been analyzed. Each insertion contains the same discrete set of Tn10 sequences flanked by a direct repetition of a 9 bp cl-gene sequence. The flanking repititions are generated by duplication of information present only in the target DNA molecule rather than by a Campbell-type recombination event between one 9 bp sequence on the target DNA and a second one provided on the incoming element. The repetitions do not contain genetic or structural information important for translocation. A genetically constructed Tn10 insertion which lacks flanking repetitions is fully functional in translocation to a new position. Tn10 insertions cluster at preferred positions along a target DNA (Kleckner et al., 1979). Sequence analysis shows that four independently isolated cl::Tn10 insertions occur at identical positions in the cl gene. We speculate that homology between Tn10 and its target, at some distance from the site of the actual recombination event, could be relevant to the preference of Tn10 for particular insertion sites.
