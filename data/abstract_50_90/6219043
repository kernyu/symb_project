The origin of replication of the IncW plasmid pSa has been cloned and the function of this origin in Escherichia coli examined. A 1.9-kb region of DNA is required for efficient autonomous replication, and a 0.47-kb fragment within this region can initiate replication only in the presence of an autonomously replicating derivative of pSa. An Mr 35,000 protein (repA) is encoded adjacent to the origin and is required for efficient initiation of replication. The derivatives examined provide information suggesting a direct role of partition factors in plasmid replication and incompatibility.
