The development of antimicrobial drugs, and particularly of antibiotics, has played a considerable role in substantially reducing the morbidity and mortality rates of many infectious diseases. However, the fact that bacteria can develop resistance to antibiotics has produced a situation where antimicrobial agents are losing their effectiveness because of the spread and persistence of drug-resistant organisms. To combat this, more and more antibiotics with increased therapeutic and prophylactic action will need to be developed.This article is concerned with antibiotic resistance in bacteria which are pathogenic to man and animals. The historical background is given, as well as some information on the present situation and trends of antibiotic resistance to certain bacteria in different parts of the world. Considerable concern is raised over the use of antibiotics in man and animals. It is stated that antibiotic resistance in human pathogens is widely attributed to the "misuse" of antibiotics for treatment and prophylaxis in man and to the administration of antibiotics to animals for a variety of purposes (growth promotion, prophylaxis, or therapy), leading to the accumulation of resistant bacteria in their flora. Factors favouring the development of resistance are discussed.
