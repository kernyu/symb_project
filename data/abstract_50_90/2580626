Tumor cell growth-inhibiting factors (TIFs) have been shown to inhibit the growth of tumor cell lines in culture. TIF-1, the first TIF to be described, is a low-molecular-weight, acid- and heat-stable polypeptide with no antiviral activity. A second class of TIFs (TIF-2) has now been isolated from the conditioned media of a human rhabdomyosarcoma cell line and partially purified by polyacrylamide gel filtration, cation exchange, and reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography. Partially purified preparations of TIF-2 inhibit the growth of a variety of human tumor cells in soft agar and monolayer cultures and are mitogenic for normal human and mouse cells. TIF-2 has no antiviral activity. The growth-inhibitory effects of TIF-2 are reversible when the affected cells are no longer exposed to the factor. Although both TIF-1 and TIF-2 are obtained from the same source, they can be distinguished by their molecular weight, heat lability, elution pattern from reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography, and their effect on the growth of mink lung epithelial cells. The growth of a human tumor cell variant, selected for resistance to growth inhibition by TIF-1, is inhibited by TIF-2. TIFs may therefore be a family of related polypeptides which selectively inhibit the growth of tumor cells.
