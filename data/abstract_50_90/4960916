Spores of Bacillus megaterium QM B1551 treated with thioglycolate (0.4 m, pH 2.6) at 50 C for 30 min remained refractile, but they became stainable, lysozymesensitive, and nonviable, and they lost dipicolinic acid (DPA). The loss of DPA and of viability were functions of the time and temperature of exposure to thioglycolate. Spores treated with thioglycolate at a lower temperature and for a shorter time (30 C, 5 min) retained DPA, viability, and nonstainability. Although these spores also retained their resistance to gamma radiation and to lysozyme, they lost thermo-resistance. Their percentage of germination over a 2-hr period in glucose was markedly reduced. Germinability and heat resistance were restored by exogenous cations, suggesting that the thioglycolate treatment (30 C, 5 min) resulted in the loss of spore ions essential for normal germination in glucose and for heat resistance.
