Enterobacter aerogenes was isolated from the finger tips of 13.3 percent of hospital personnel while they were working in the wards. Gentamicin resistant strains were isolated more frequently than gentamicin sensitive. Carriage rate of E. aerogenes was higher among nurses than other staff members. There was no correlation between antibiotic resistance, capsular serotypes and survival of these strains on finger tips. The property of prolonged survival on finger tips is chromosomal in nature and not mediated by conjugative or non-conjugative plasmids.
