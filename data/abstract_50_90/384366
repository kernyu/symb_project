By employing a system of RNA polymerase binding and restriction endonuclease digestion, we demonstrate that the region in and around the Hind III site of pBR313 and pBR322 is the promoter for the tetracycline (Tc) resistance gene(s). Furthermore, it is shown that this region was transferred intact from pSC101 during the construction of the latter plasmids. The in vitro insertion of a few base pairs at the Hind III site produces a series of "down" promoter mutations in which the level of in vivo Tc resistance is reduced. Sequence analysis of the various promoter mutations revealed significant base pair rearrangements in the region between -40 and -12 of the promoter. While these base alterations do not appear to affect the firm binding of RNA polymerase, they do affect the ability of mutant promoters to initiate transcription. These observations suggest that the region from -40 to -12, previously designated as the "recognition region", is actually involved in the process of initiation of transcription.
