The growth and survival of several rifampin-resistant isolates of denitrifying bacteria were examined under anaerobic (denitrifying) and aerobic conditions. Two isolates added to nonsterile Bruno soil at densities of between 10(4) and 10(6) CFU g dry soil-1 exhibited an initial period of growth followed by a gradual decline in numbers. After 28 days, both isolates maintained viable populations of between 10(4) and 10(5) CFU g dry soil-1 under both denitrifying and aerobic conditions. One of the isolates consistently grew better under denitrifying conditions, and the other isolate consistently grew better under aerobic conditions. The relative pattern of denitrifying versus aerobic growth for each organism was not affected by the addition of glucose. The growth yields of the two isolates varied with soil type, but the relative pattern of denitrifying versus aerobic growth was consistent in three soils with greatly different properties. Five of nine isolates introduced into Bruno soil at low population densities (approximately 10(5) CFU g dry soil-1) exhibited better growth after 2 days under denitrifying conditions. It was not possible to predict the prevalence of the denitrifying or aerobic mode of growth in nonsterile soil from the growth characteristics of the isolates in pure cultures or sterile soil.
