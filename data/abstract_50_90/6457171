A new antibiotic drug of oxacephem, with marked resistance to beta-lactamase, 6059-S for parenteral use was tested in 10 patients with acute peritonitis. In 4 cases with appendicitis, 6059-S in a dose of 500 mg was given intramuscularly before operation. In 2 cases with perforate MECKEL'S diverticulitis and intestinal obstruction for right femoral hernia, 6059-S in a dose of 1 g was given by intravenous injection or intravenous drip infusion before or during operation. And in a case with peritonitis after gastrectomy for gastric cancer, 6059-S in a dose of 2 g was given by intravenous drip infusion. Tissue specimens of different sites or body fluids were taken during the operation and from the removed organs. The materials or purulent ascites were subsequently taken at intervals. Determination of 6059-S concentration was performed according to plate agar well bioassay method with Escherichia coli 7437 strain. The peak of 6059-S concentration in purulent ascites of patient with peritonitis for perforate MECKEL'S diverticulitis was 30.5 mcg/ml at 50 min. after 1 g intravenous administration. Concentration of 6059-S in drained pus was 8.38 mcg/ml soon after intravenous drip infusion (2 g, for 2 hrs.). In 10 patients with peritonitis, 6 patients were given 6059-S in a dose of 500 mg by intramuscular administration twice a day, and the serious 4 patients were given in a dose of 1 to 2 g by intravenous drip infusion 1 to 2 times a day. Clinical response was excellent in 6 cases, good in 3 cases, fair in 1 case and poor was none. Any clinical adverse effect was not recognized. On the 6059-S concentration in patients with peritonitis, the concentration in purulent ascites, drained pus and infected tissues were observed higher than the MIC of 6059-S against Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Therefore 6059-S will be a very useful drug when used for chemotherapy of acute or subacute peritonitis.
