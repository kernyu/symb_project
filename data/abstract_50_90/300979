The effect of the polyene antibiotic filipin on the electrical properties and the passive permeability of the cell membranes was investigated. The addition of filipin to the outside bathing solution has the following effects: 1. it results in a drastic reduction in the transepithelial resistance and potential, 2. it causes a 10-20 times increase in the passive transepithelial chloride, sodium and sucrose flux, 3. it results in the formation of an amiloride insensitive sodium pathway in the outward facing membrane, 4. it results in an active outward transport of potassium, 5. it results in a highly significant swelling of all the cells in the epithelium. The addition of filipin to the inside bathing solution has the following effects 1. it results in an activation of the active sodium transport, 2. it causes a slight increase in the passive transepithelial chloride and sodium permeabilities but has no effect on the sucrose permeability, 3. it has no effect on the amiloride inhibition of the short-circuit current, 4. it has no effect on the volume of the cells in the epithelium. It is suggested that the addition of filipin to the outside bathing solution increases the direct sodium flow from cell to cell in neighbour layers. Furthermore these experiments indicate that the outward facing membrane of the isolated frog skin has a high cholesterol content as compared with the cholesterol content of the inward facing membrane.
