P. cepacia is reported to be an increasing cause of infection and colonization of patients in hospitals. Historically it is an important contaminant in the pharmaceutical industry. Its nutritional versatility, ability to survive and multiply in water, high intrinsic resistance to antibiotics, and ability to multiply in the majority of traditional disinfectants make it a superb agent for causing nosocomial infection. Recognition of its differences from P. aeruginosa and its ability to contaminate agents used in hospitals is important in proper treatment and infection control.
