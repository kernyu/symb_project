Acyclovir, the new virucidal drug recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of herpes simplex virus (HSV), is the first available effective drug to treat such infections. Acyclovir boasts activity against four of the five major herpes-group viruses, including herpes simplex (types 1 and 2), varicella-zoster, and Epstein-Barr. The drug, phosphorylated preferentially in viral cells, exclusively attacks infected cells possessing virus-specific DNA polymerase, giving acyclovir low toxicity coupled with high efficacy. Problems of renal toxicity and viral resistance now dampen some of the initial expectations. Present-day research continues to reveal insights into the mechanism and action of acyclovir.
