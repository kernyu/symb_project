The inactivation of Clostridium perfringens type A spores (three strains of different heat resistances) at ultrahigh temperatures was studied. Aqueous spore suspensions were heated at 85 to 135 C by the capillary tube method. When survivors were enumerated on the standard plating medium, the spores appeared to have been rapidly inactivated at temperatures above 100 C. The addition of lysozyme to the plating medium did not affect the recovery of spores surviving the early stages of heating, but lysozyme was required for maximal recovery of spores surviving extended heat treatments. The percentage of survivors requiring lysozyme for colony formation increased greatly with longer exposure times or increasing treatment temperature. Time-survivor curves indicated that each spore suspension was heterogeneous with respect to the heat resistance of spore outgrowth system or in the sensitivity of the spores to lysozyme. Recovery of survivors on the lysozyme containing medium revealed greater heat resistance for one strain than has been reported for spores of many mesophilic aerobes and anaerobes. The spores of all three strains were more resistant to heat inactivation when suspended in phosphate buffer, but a greater percentage of the survivors required lysozyme for colony formation.
