Since 1973, when doxycycline was introduced as peroperative prophylaxis in elective colorectal surgery at Malmo General Hospital, Sweden, there has been an unchanged and low rate (8-12%) of septic complications in colonic surgery. For treating postoperative infections ampicillin, cefuroxime and piperacillin have been used since 1973, 1980 and 1982 respectively. The sensitivity pattern of E. coli and Klebsiella against these four antibiotics used for prophylaxis and treatment has been followed for the past five years and only minor changes have occurred through the period. However, a lower frequency of antibiotic resistance was recorded for bacteria isolated peroperatively than postoperatively after colorectal surgery or from infection sites from other patients presumably mostly due to selection caused by antibiotics used within the hospital. Due to the good clinical outcome and seemingly lack of development of antibiotic resistance in peroperative isolates, doxycycline still remains a choice for prophylaxis in bowel surgery.
