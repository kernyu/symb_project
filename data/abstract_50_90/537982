Halofuginone at 3 ppm in the ration was tested against turkey coccidial infections caused by four species, in a series of eight battery trials of 16 days duration. The drug was evaluated against infections caused by Eimeria meleagrimitis, E. adenoeides, E. gallopavonis, and E. dispersa. As measured by livability, weight gain, feed efficiency, morbidity, dropping score, lesion score, and oocyst production the drug was highly effective in Beltsville Small White turkeys. The drug at 3 ppm appeared to be about equally effective against all four species and almost completely prevented infection or the effects of infection in some experiments, except when the challenge was too severe.
