A method for computerized analysis of the antiviral efficiency of drugs and immunoglobulins was developed. The sensitivities of herpes simplex virus (HSV), cytomegalovirus (CMV) and varicella-zoster virus (VZV) to antiviral drugs were determined. A new type of neutralization assay could be performed rapidly and accurately with HSV and CMV. Combining immunological methods for herpesvirus antigen detection with a computerized analysis permitted rapid, sensitive measurement of drug sensitivities, comparison of antiviral activities at various virus concentrations and selection of potent neutralizing antisera.
