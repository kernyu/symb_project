Two silver sulfadiazine-resistant isolates of Enterobacter cloacae obtained in a burns unit where the drug was in use were studied. These strains were resistant to elevated levels of the drug, and they were cross-resistant to silver benzoate, but not to silver nitrate. Growth of the strains in nutritionally poor defined media sensitized them to the inhibitory action of the drug. Exposure of the bacteria to penicillins rendered them susceptible to silver sulfadiazine. The resistant bacteria harbored episomes for resistance to carbenicillin and kanamycin; however, resistance to silver sulfadiazine could not be transferred by these episomes. Twenty-three strains of E. cloacae isolated in a general hospital were sensitive to much lower levels of the drug (</=50 mug/ml).
