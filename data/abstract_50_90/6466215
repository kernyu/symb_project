A study of 29 children and adolescents with cystic fibrosis over 2 years showed some evidence of benefit from the twice daily inhalation of 20 mg nebulized gentamicin when compared to the inhalation of a nebulized saline mixture. Clinical symptoms, deterioration in pulmonary function, antibiotic usage, days in hospital and development of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the sputum were recorded. There was no significant difference in antibiotic usage, days in hospital or clinical symptoms between the two regimes. Those subjects with P. aeruginosa in sputum showed significantly less deterioration in lung function over 2 years while using gentamicin aerosol. There was no difference in progress between the two treatment regimes for those subjects with P. aeruginosa in sputum at the beginning of the study, nor was there any difference in the number developing P. aeruginosa in sputum.
