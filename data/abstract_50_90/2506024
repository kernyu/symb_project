From July 1987 to January 1988, 452 cefoperazone-resistant bacterial isolates were identified among strains subjected to routine susceptibility testing in a clinical microbiology laboratory. The 452 isolates were tested for susceptibility to cefoperazone, sulbactam, and a 2:1 combination of these drugs by agar dilution techniques. The greatest benefit of the cefoperazone-sulbactam combination was noted against Bacteroides spp. and Acinetobacter spp. The combination demonstrated clinically significant synergism against approximately 20% of strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
