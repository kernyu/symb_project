Giving medical feed to weanling pigs it is possible to produce a vitamin K-deficiency as a side effect, which is caused by destruction of the intestinal flora. In this investigation the effect of different drugs in a vitamin K-deficient diet on blood coagulation of weanling pigs was examined. In a first trial clinical symptoms of a vitamin K-dependent coagulation disorder could be seen in five from six animals after feeding a combination of sulfadimidine, tylosin, furazolidone and arsanilic acid. Animals showed haemorrhages, when they were housed on flatdecks as well as on concrete floor. This indicated that coprophagy plays no role in pigs for supply of vitamin K. Feeding these drugs in other combinations or one of the drugs alone caused no clinical signs in a second trial. Significant differences to untreated control pigs were found only in one group (sulfadimidine/arsanilic acid) for activities of coagulation factors. Other groups demonstrated only prolongation of clotting times in single animals. Pigs, which received sulfadimidine within their ration, were more often affected than other animals. In a third trial suckling pigs were treated over a period of three weeks with a drug combination used in the first trial to allow an adaptation of the intestinal flora. Same treatment after weaning was unable to produce any clinical symptoms, but led to distinct coagulation disorders in pigs treated before as well as in untreated animals. It is supposed that the development of a vitamin K-deficiency depends on faecal bacterial count and on the specific resistance of intestinal flora in individuals.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
