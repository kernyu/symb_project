One hundred and eighty strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae were isolated from various materials at the Institute of Medical Microbiology in Zurich between March and October 1978. Examination of these isolates for resistance to 6 standard antimicrobials revealed that 17 (9.4%) strains were resistant to the tetracyclines, 2 strains to sulphamethoxazole/trimethoprim and 1 strain to both tetracycline and chloramphenicol. All strains were highly sensitive to benzylpenicillin, cephalothin and erythromycin. Serotyping of the pneumococci was done by the capsular quellung reaction. The prevalent serotypes in the entire collection of strains were Nos. 6, 23, 19, 3, 9, 14 and 7. The prevalent serotypes of strains isolated from blood, cerebrospinal fluid, pus, and bronchial secretions were Nos. 4, 8, 7, 14, 9, 3, 19 and 6. Vaccination with PneumovaxTM, a vaccine containing 14 capsular antigens, should provide protection against 75% of pneumococci identified as true pathogens in this study. Pneumococci are rather rarely isolated in our laboratories. For this reason, and because the strains isolated are still sensitive to antibiotics in conventional use, mass vaccination of the population in Switzerland is not recommended. Vaccination should be carried out in certain high risk groups of patients.
