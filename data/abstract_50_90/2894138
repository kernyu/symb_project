All rimantadine-resistant variants of influenza virus prepared by consecutive passages in the presence of rimantadine had increased virion transcriptase activity as compared to the original strains. The increased virion transcriptase activity of rimantadine-resistant strains was unrelated to the possible role of M1 protein, since RNPs isolated from the virions of these variants also revealed higher transcriptase activity as compared to RNPs isolated from rimantadine-sensitive virus. The study of rimantadine-resistant recombinant X-4 which inherited from the resistant fowl plague virus (FPV) only the gene 7 coding for M proteins provided additional evidence for the suggestion that the increased virion transcriptase activity of rimantadine-resistant influenza virus variants is coincidental rather than directly associated with such resistance.
