The influence of Nifurtimox on Trypanosoma brucei, T. congolense, T. equinum, T. equiperdum, T. evansi, T. gambiense, T. lewisi, T. rhodesiense, T. vivax, Leishmania donovani and L. tropica has been studied in animals and in vitro. The drug was active against all of them but there are considerable differences in sensitivity of the various species as well as of different strains of T. rhodesiense. For the treatment of T. rhodesiense a single high dosage was more efficient than the same dose divided into many smaller applications. The latter dose schedule is more suitable for the treatment of T. cruzi and T. lewisi. L. donovani and L. tropica responded to Nifurtimox but only in vitro.
