In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of MT-141, a new cephamycin, against anaerobic bacteria were compared with those of cefmetazole (CMZ), cefoxitin, cefotaxime, ceftizoxime, latamoxef and cefazolin to obtain the following results. MT-141 showed high activity against a wide variety of anaerobic bacteria including B. fragilis and C. difficile except for Eubacterium lentum, E. aerofaciens and B. furcosus. Antibacterial activity of MT-141 against anaerobic bacteria was almost independent of inoculum size, medium, pH and serum addition. In vitro development of resistance of MT-141 against P. variabilis and B. fragilis was comparable to that of CMZ. Successive parenteral administration of MT-141 into mice did not cause abnormal proliferation of C. difficile. MT-141 showed excellent therapeutic effect against experimental subcutaneous abscess in mice caused by B. fragilis.
