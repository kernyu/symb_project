In seven groups of teju-lizards and tortoises, twenty-five tejus and thirty tortoises were found to be harbouring Salmonella. The serotypes of the Salmonella organisms harboured by these animals were identified. The animals positive for Salmonella were treated with 75 mg. of ampicillin and 250 mg. of chloramphenicol per animal daily. Of the animals treated for five days, twenty out of twenty-three (both tejus and tortoises) became free from Salmonella. The strains of Salmonella isolated after treatment all were adequately sensitive to the antibiotics administered. All animals, i.e. two tejus and seven tortoises, became negative following treatment for ten days. In seven strains of Salmonella isolated from tejus prior to treatment, sensitivity to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, streptomycin and terramycin was determined. Sensitivity to the three first-named antibiotics ranged from adequate to moderate, sensitivity to terramycine being slight or absent. In five out of six cases, serotypes other than those isolated prior to treatment were isolated from those animals which continued to be positive after treatment.
