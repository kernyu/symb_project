Nineteen experimental phages were derived by mitomycin-C induction from methicillin-resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus collected world-wide. They were assessed for their ability to distinguish isolates of a methicillin-resistant strain of S. aureus epidemic in the London area from other British strains, both sensitive and resistant to methicillin. The experimental phages were most active against strains of phage groups III and I + III. One phage was related to the phages of lytic group I. A typing pattern common to isolates of the epidemic strain was identified and used as an aid in the recognition of this strain. Ten of the phages were retained for further study.
