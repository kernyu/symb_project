We describe the first case of septicaemia with Flavimonas oryzihabitans reported from Germany and possibly associated with colonisation of a venous port system. The patient, an 8-year-old T-cell leukaemic girl, was receiving a third course of chemotherapy before bone marrow transplantation. The cardinal symptom, fever, subsided when the venous port system for administration of drugs was no more used. The organism was tested extensively for characteristic biochemical features and antimicrobial susceptibility. We discuss the relevant literature and suggest the means of making a definitive microbiological diagnosis.
