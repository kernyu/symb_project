The locus of neomycin resistance is located at near equal distances from the loci of erythromycin and oligomycin resistance on mitDNA, as the analysis of recombination frequencies between three markers has shown in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae descending from XII race. We studied the influence of the resistance to these antibiotics on the yield of spontaneous and induced by 24% ethanol rho- mutations in 2 haploid and 126 diploid strains of yeast. All of the neomycin resistant strains were characterized by significantly lower level of spontaneous mutations in comparison with other strains. Ethanol did not induce rho- mutagenesis in neomycin resistant strains or slightly increased it (up to 2-4%). However ethanol increased the yield of these mutations up to 58% in neomycin sensitive strain. The killing effect of ethanol on diploid strains did not depend on their genotype.
