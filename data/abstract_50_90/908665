A wild strain of Staphylococcus aureus which inactivates a wide variety of antibiotics has been found to inactivate pristinamycin IIA, an antistaphylococcal antibiotic. This phenomenon has been demonstrated to be plasmid mediated. The plasmid directs the biosynthesis of an acetyltransferase which is able to O-acetylate the drug. We propose to call the new enzyme PAC (IIA): Pristinamycin acetyltransferase.
