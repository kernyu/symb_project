The objectives of this study were (i) to determine if in vivo administration of ethanol to rats produced changes in apparent lipid fluidity and prolactin binding capacity of male prostatic and female hepatic membranes and (ii) to compare the effects of membrane fluidizers (aliphatic alcohols) in vitro on prolactin binding of prostatic and hepatic membranes in control and alcohol-fed animals. In vitro ethanol has been shown by us previously to increase prolactin receptor levels presumably by unmasking cryptic prolactin receptors. The degree of fluidization was monitored by a fluorescence polarization method using 1,6-diphenylhexatriene. Adult male and female rats were given either water or 4% ethanol as the sole source of drinking fluid for a period of 6 weeks. No significant changes in plasma prolactin were observed between control and ethanol-treated groups of either sex. However, the microviscosity parameter, inversely related to lipid fluidity, was increased approx. 34% and 40%, respectively, in male prostatic and female rat hepatic membranes after ethanol feeding. Furthermore, 125I-prolactin binding capacity was decreased approx. 30% and 26%, respectively, in prostatic and hepatic membranes of alcohol fed animals. In vitro treatment with aliphatic alcohols had no effect on either microviscosity or prolactin binding in hepatic or prostatic membranes from ethanol-fed rats, but both fluidized and increased prolactin binding in the same membrane preparations from control rats. Our observations are consistent with the direct relationship between membrane fluidity and prolactin receptor levels. The changes in prostatic and hepatic membranes after alcohol feeding, namely decreased prolactin receptor levels, decreased fluidity and increased resistance to the fluidizing effects of in vitro aliphatic alcohols may reflect a fundamental membrane defect.
