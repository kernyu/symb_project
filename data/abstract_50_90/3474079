Sixty-four patients with complicated UTI (58) and P. aeruginosa ear infections (6) were treated with oral ofloxacin. All patients were infected with multiply-resistant problem organisms, which had very low minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) when tested in vitro with ofloxacin. The immediate cure rate was 86% and the maintained cure rate was 75%, an excellent result considering the complicated nature of the infections. This result has been attributed to the great efficacy of ofloxacin and its excellent pharmacokinetics. There was a very low incidence of mild side effects. Because resistance to quinolones is not mediated by R-factors, it is recommended to select them as first choice in the treatment of patients with complicated UTI with indwelling catheters or nephrostomy tubes, and in patients with discharging ears in order to limit the spread of resistant strains in the hospital environment and in the community.
