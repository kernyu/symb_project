Moxalactam was evaluated in the therapy of lower respiratory tract infections in 40 patients. The most common organisms isolated were Streptococcus pneumoniae (37.2%) and Haemophilus influenzae (21.5%). Gram-negative enteric organisms were isolated from six patients. No patient was evaluated as a treatment failure; however, two patients died of unrelated causes either during therapy or in the immediate posttherapy period. We determined the comparative minimal inhibitory concentrations of moxalactam, cefamandole, and cephalothin for our aerobic clinical isolates. Susceptibilities of the anaerobic isolates were measured by the Kirby-Bauer method. All isolates were susceptible to moxalactam. Moxalactam was found to be highly effective in the therapy of lower respiratory tract infections.
