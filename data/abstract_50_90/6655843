Fundamental and clinical trials were carried out with cefpiramide (CPM) in pediatric infections. Results were as follows. CPM has a broad spectrum of activity against both Gram-positive and -negative microorganisms, including Pseudomonas. Half-lives of CPM were more prolonged than any others that have ever been reported on cephalosporin derivatives. The mean half-lives in the blood after infection were 4.76 hours and 4.14 hours, when the doses were 10 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg, respectively. The average recovery rates in the urine between 0 and 8 hours were 17.1% and 24.7%, when the intravenous doses were 10 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg, respectively. Thirty-two pediatric patients received CPM in doses ranging from 31.9 to 88.2 mg/kg divided mainly 2 times a day. They were respiratory tract infection in 23, urinary tract infection in 8, and SSSS in 1. The rate of satisfactory clinical response was 90.6%. Clinical side effect observed were mild diarrhea in 7 cases. Slight elevation of GOT and GPT were observed in 3 cases. All were considered to be minor.
