Liberation and metabolism of arachidonic acid may be the common final pathway of different stimuli on the pulmonary vascular bed. In a model of isolated, ventilated rabbit lungs, perfused with Krebs Henseleit albumin buffer in a recirculating system, changes of pulmonary vascular resistance and of vascular permeability are monitored continuously. The addition of free arachidonic acid or of the Ca-ionophore A 23187 to the perfusion fluid consistently evokes a biphasic increase in vascular resistance as well as an initially reversible increase in vascular permeability, followed by pulmonary edema. Both phases of increased vascular resistance are completely suppressed by inhibition of the cyclooxygenase, decreased to a large degree by inhibitors of thromboxane synthetase, and markedly augmented by short preincubation of arachidonic acid with ram seminal vesicular microsomes and by sulfhydryl reagents. The increased pulmonary vascular permeability is augmented by inhibition of cyclooxygenase and reduced by simultaneous lipoxygenase inhibition. Antagonists of histamine, serotonin and sympathic or parasympathic activity do not have any influence. PG F2alpha., TxB2, PG E2 and PG I2 alter the pulmonary vascular resistance, but do not increase vascular permeability. In conclusion, increased availability of free arachidonic acid evokes a rise in pulmonary vascular resistance, which can be ascribed to cyclooxygenase products, especially to thromboxane, and causes a rise in vascular permeability which can be ascribed to lipoxygenase products. The findings may be related to acute pulmonary lesions with increase in vascular resistance and with vascular leakage.
