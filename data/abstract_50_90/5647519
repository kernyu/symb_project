Prasinomycin, a new antibiotic from the green spore streptomycete, Streptomyces prasinus, primarily inhibits the growth of gram-positive microorganisms. Like penicillin, it is effective only against growing cells. Though primarily bacteriostatic at levels about the minimal inhibitory concentration, it is bactericidal at higher levels. Neither synergism nor antagonism could be demonstrated for prasinomycin with a variety of other antibiotics. It is highly active upon subcutaneous administration to mice infected with Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes C203, or Diplococcus pneumoniae. Prasinomycin has a unique prophylactic action whereby one dose protects mice against experimental infections for as long as 2 months. It is more effective against S. aureus infections in mice when administered subcutaneously 20 hr prior to infection than when given in divided doses 1 hr before and 4 hr after infection.
