The clinical features of Group G streptococcal bacteraemia in nine patients are reported. The serious nature of many of these infections was striking, with major embolic complications in all three patients with endocarditis. In this hospital, Group G streptococcal bacteraemia is now more common than that caused by Streptococcus pyogenes. Laboratory investigations included serotyping and antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Although the strains isolated were found to be sensitive to a broad range of agents, tolerance was observed to a varying extent with penicillin, erythromycin and vancomycin. The clinical significance of this observation remains to be determined.
