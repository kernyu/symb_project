Hepatic abscesses are rarely encountered in disseminated Nocardia infections. Sulfonamides alone or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole is often efficacious in treating infections caused by Nocardia asteroides. In vitro resistance of N. asteroides to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole is occasionally present. The patient described in this report had disseminated nocardiosis initially manifesting as multiple subcapsular hepatic abscesses. In vitro susceptibility studies demonstrated resistance to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Subsequent treatment with ampicillin and amikacin in conjunction with computed tomography-guided needle aspiration of several of the hepatic abscesses, surgical drainage of a right pleural empyema, and eventual discontinuation of use of corticosteroids resulted in cure of the infection.
