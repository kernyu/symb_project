Twelve genetically determined brain polypeptide charge variants were identified by comparing cerebellar vermis of 7 inbred mouse strains and of mice selectively bred from 8 strains closely related to these 7 ancestral strains and one other for acute behavioral sensitivity to the sedative effects of ethanol. The selectively bred ethanol-sensitive (LS, long sleep) and insensitive (SS, short sleep) mice exhibited different allelic variants at 6 of these 12 gene loci expressed in the cerebellum. Variant polypeptide A1 (81 kdalton, pI 5.6) was shown to be associated with the membrane of synaptosomal mitochondria and to exhibit a basic variant in SS mice that is determined by a dominant allele. Other variant polypeptides showed codominant inheritance in F1 crosses. However, the phenotype of no single one of these brain polypeptides consistently correlated with the ethanol behavioral sensitivity of the 7 inbred mouse strains nor of 8 recombinant inbred (B X D, C57BL X DBA) strains. This finding supports the hypothesis that a substantial amount of inbreeding, leading to random fixation of alleles independent of selection for ethanol sensitivity, occurred during the breeding of the SS and LS mice. The present findings of a lack of a strong association between sleep time and a brain polypeptide variant do not preclude the existence of a major gene effect contributing to variation in acute sensitivity to ethanol but are consistent with reports that multiple loci are responsible for the difference in ethanol sensitivity between SS and LS mice.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
