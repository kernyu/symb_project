The thiostrepton resistance gene (tsr) of Streptomyces azureus, and a synthetic oligonucleotide adapter sequence, were introduced into the DNA of attP-site-deleted phage phi C31-based cloning vectors. The DNA of two of the new derivatives, KC515 and KC516, contains single sites for the enzymes BamHI, BglII, PstI, PvuII, SstI (two sites close together) and XhoI, available for the insertion of DNA of up to 4 kb. The two vectors also contain a cloned, promoterless viomycin phosphotransferase gene (vph) from Streptomyces vinaceus. When an internal segment of the Streptomyces coelicolor glycerol (gyl) operon was inserted at the appropriate position and in the correct orientation next to vph, it could bring about in vivo recombination leading to fusion of vph of the chromosomally located gyl operon, resulting in glycerol-regulated expression of viomycin resistance. Two other new phi C31 derivatives, KC505 and KC518, are PstI and BamHI replacement vectors, respectively, for 2-8-kb DNA fragments, and allow simple screening for the presence of inserted DNA.
