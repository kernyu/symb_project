A mutation (asparagine 815 to serine 815) was introduced into the herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) DNA polymerase (pol). The HSV-1 pol enzyme in lysates of Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells expressing the mutant protein showed increased resistance to acyclovir triphosphate and increased sensitivity to phosphonoacetate but was not substantially altered with respect to sensitivity to phosphonoformate or aphidicolin. These results directly demonstrate that both resistance to acyclovir triphosphate and sensitivity to phosphonoacetate can be conferred by this mutation in the absence of other viral factors and that the yeast expression system can be used for structure-function studies on HSV-1 pol.
