The composition of fatty acids of methicillin-resistant (MR) and methicillin-sensitive (MS) strains of Staph. aureus and Staph. epidermidis was determined with the method of reactive gas liquid chromatography. The MS staphylococci of the above species differed by the content of acids with branched chains of iso- and anteisostructures and straight chains. Anteisoacids in the cells of Staph. epidermidis amounted almost to 80 per cent of the total number of the acids, while in the cells of Staph. aureus, their total number amounted only to a half of the fatty acid pool. Comparison of the composition of the fatty acids of the MS and MR strains of Staph. aureus revealed differences in the proportions of the anteiso- and isoacids. The total number of the long-chain C20.0 acid in the cells of Staph. epidermidis resistant to methicillin was lower as compared to that in the sensitive cells.
