Contrary to expectation, l-cysteine did not protect Escherichia coli from the lethal action of two monofunctional alkylating agents (nitrosomethylurethane and methylmethane sulfonate). The antibacterial action of these compounds was actually greatly enhanced by l-cysteine. This synergistic effect was also exhibited, to some extent, by d-cysteine but not by homocysteine, S-methylcysteine, or serine. The synergistic action between methylating agents and l-cysteine was not due to the formation of S-methylcysteine. l-Cysteine had no effect on the bacteriostatic action of ethylmethane sulfonate.
