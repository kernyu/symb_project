The case is presented of a renal-transplant patient in Europe with a Mycobacterium haemophilum infection in association with M. xenopi infection. Clinical signs suggested the diagnosis of mycobacteriosis, which was confirmed by a skin biopsy. Despite antitubercular treatment which rapidly eliminated M. xenopi, the patient's condition did not improve until M. haemophilum was identified. Minimal inhibitory concentrations of various antimicrobial compounds showed a lack of efficacy of isoniazid, and rifampin had no clinical effect. The patient recovered only after careful surgical drainage of the lesions and the administration of minocycline. The pathogenesis of such mycobacterioses is discussed, with focus on the immunodepressive status which in our patient may have been partially induced by a cytomegalovirus reinfection.
