Twenty five strains of Staphylococcus aureus of human and environmental origin were tested for their enzymatic patterns. All human strains possessed acid phosphatase, while only 25% of the environmental staphylococci demonstrated acid phosphatase activity. In addition, the enzyme alpha-glucosidase was present only in the methicillin resistant-multiresistant strains, in spite of their origin. This work suggests a possible role of the enzyme on penicillin-binding protein mediated methicillin-resistance and stresses the importance of external habitat in the expression of enzymatic activity of bacteria. The enzymatic pattern may confirm or exclude cross-infection, when a single species, with uniformly antibiotic responses, is involved.
