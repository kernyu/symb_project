The dihydrofolate reductase encoded by plasmid pUK1123, which confers only a moderate level of trimethoprim resistance on its host, has been isolated and characterized. This enzyme, designated type IV, differs markedly from all previously described plasmid dihydrofolate reductases. It has a relatively high molecular weight of 46,700 as measured by gel filtration and, unlike previous plasmid dihydrofolate reductases, its synthesis is induced in the presence of increasing concentrations of trimethoprim. It is only slightly resistant to trimethoprim but is competitively inhibited by this drug with an inhibitor binding constant of 63 nM. In addition, the enzyme has a relatively low affinity for the substrate, dihydrofolate (Km = 37 microM). This is the first report of a plasmid trimethoprim resistance mechanism resulting from the induced synthesis of a large molecular weight dihydrofolate reductase which is only slightly resistant to trimethoprim. The possible origins of the type IV enzyme are discussed.
