Several aspects of the strA phenotype were studied in strains of Escherichia coli diploid in the strA chromosomal region. It was found that alleles causing different levels of interference with amber suppression can complement each other, the less restrictive effects being predominant. The sensitive strA(+) allele determines two responses to streptomycin: a dominant effect consisting of a sudden, complete, but reversible inhibition of growth, and a recessive effect manifested as cell killing. Both restriction of suppression and inhibition of growth reflect ribosomal involvement in translation.
