Peptidoglycan (PG) from Legionella pneumophila was composed of muramic acid, glucosamine, glutamic acid, alanine, and meso-diaminopimelic acid in a molar ratio of 0.8:0.8:1.1:1.7:1. Partially purified PG contained trypsin-insensitive proteins which were extracted by 1 N NaOH hydrolysis without apparent dissolution of the PG. Lysozyme hydrolysis of purified PG or cell walls caused an increase in reducing groups which correlated with roughly 70 to 100% digestion of disaccharides. However, there was no significant decrease in turbidity during lysozyme hydrolysis of purified PG or cell wall. Additionally, 80 to 90% of the meso-diaminopimelic acid epsilon-amino groups were not susceptible to dinitrophenylation. Collectively, the PG of L. pneumophila was sensitive to lysozyme hydrolysis and insensitive to alkali dissolution, and 80 to 90% of the NH2 groups of meso-diaminopimelic acid were apparently involved in cross-linkages between peptides.
