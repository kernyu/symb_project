Several antimicrobial regimens were evaluated in the treatment of experimental enterococcal endocarditis due to a beta-lactamase-producing, highly gentamicin-resistant strain of Enterococcus faecalis. Ampicillin alone cleared bacteremia in the majority of rats and reduced titers of bacteria within vegetations (6.84 versus 8.80 log10 CFU/g in controls) but did not sterilize valves. Ampicillin-sulbactam combinations, vancomycin, daptomycin, and imipenem each reduced residual bacterial titers within vegetations to 4.01 log10 CFU/g or less; in 26 to 43% of animals receiving 5 days of therapy, titers of bacteria were reduced to undetectable levels. In a separate experiment, rats received ampicillin-sulbactam, daptomycin, or vancomycin for 10 days and were then observed for 10 days after termination of therapy for evidence of relapse. In surviving rats, valves remained sterile in four of five rats treated with ampicillin-sulbactam, in five of seven treated with daptomycin, but in only one of eight receiving vancomycin.
