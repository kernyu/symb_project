We have examined Salmonellae isolated from patients in regional Hospital of Catanzaro from 1973 to 1978, and also the ones isolated from healthy people in order to detect the carriers from 1976 to 1978, and also the statements of salmonellosis from 1974 to 1978. We noticed a progressive increase of the cases of salmonellosis and a diminution of cases of typhoid fever which, anyway, is still rather relevant in comparison with other regions. All the types of S. isolated, their geographic distribution and their resistance to antibiotics are reported.
