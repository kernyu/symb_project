A survey was made of the frequency of resistance to amikacin, gentamicin and tobramycin among aerobic gram-negative bacilli isolated over a 4-week period in 1979 at six large, geographically separated Canadian hospitals. In the entire series of 4407 isolates the frequency of resistance was 2.5% to amikacin, 8.1% to gentamicin, 5.9% to tobramycin and 1.7% to all three. Most (81%) of the resistant bacteria were acquired by the patients after admission to hospital. The frequency of resistance to the three aminoglycoside antibiotics in each hospital largely reflected the local rate of cross-infection by endemic strains of resistant bacteria.
