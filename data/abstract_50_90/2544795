The S. rimosus amplifying sequence AUD-Sr1 encodes kanamycin and neomycin resistance, defined in the case of neomycin by aminoglycoside phosphotransferase. Its cloning on plasmid SLP1.2 makes possible the co-amplification of the obtained hybrid plasmids in S. lividans. In our study the regions responsible for resistance to aminoglycoside antibiotics and the capacity for amplification the two hybrid plasmids pSU10 and pSU3 were determined. Experiments on subcloning of the AUD-Sr1 sequence fragments on vector pIJ702 revealed localization of kanamycin and neomycin resistance determinants between PvuII(6) and BglII(7) on the AUD-Sr1 sequence fragments of 2.0 kb length. Two regions responsible for amplification of the hybrid plasmids were detected with deletion and insertion mapping. The first region is localized in the region of the plasmid SLP1.2 BamHI site and the second region is localized on the PstI(4)-PvuII(6) of the AUD-Sr1 sequence fragment of 1.1 kb length.
