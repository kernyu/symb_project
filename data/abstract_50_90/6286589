Conjugation experiments were performed in which the donor was Escherichia coli K-12 strain KP245 containing either R plasmid NR1 plus an ampicillin-resistant derivative of ColE1 (*ColE1::Tn3, called RSF2124) or NR1 plus RSF2124 carrying a cloned EcoRI fragment of NR1. The recipient was the polA amber mutant JG112, in which RSF2124 cannot replicate. Ampicillin-resistant transconjugants can arise only when the genes for ampicillin resistance are linked to NR1 or are transposed to the host chromosome. When EcoRI fragment A of NR1 (20.5 kilobases) was cloned to RSF2124, the frequency of cotransfer of ampicillin resistance with tetracycline resistance was 25 to 60%. Plasmid DNA from these ampicillin-resistant transconjugant cells was analyzed by gel electrophoresis and was shown to be a cointegrate of NR1 and the RSF2124 derivative. Analysis of plasmid DNA isolated from donor cultures showed that the cointegrates were present before conjugation, which indicates that the mating does not stimulate cointegrate formation. When the cloned fragment was EcoRI fragment H of NR1 (4.8 kilobases), the frequency of cotransfer of ampicillin resistance with tetracycline resistance was about 4%, and the majority of the ampicillin-resistant transconjugants were found to contain cointegrate plasmids. When the donor contained NR1 and RSF2124, the frequency of cotransfer of ampicillin resistance was less than 0.1%, and analysis of plasmid DNA from the ampicillin-resistant transconjugants showed that Tn3 had been transposed onto NR1. These data suggest that plasmids which share homology may exist in cointegrate form to a high degree within a host cell.
