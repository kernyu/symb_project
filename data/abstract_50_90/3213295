Bile was collected intraoperatively and through duodenal tubes from patients and was microbiologically investigated. E. coli and coliform bacteria were found to be the most common germs in bile, accounting for 51.6 per cent of all positive findings. Streptococcus faecalis and Proteus spec. increased remarkably to 17 per cent each. Calculated antibiotic therapy was found to depend for good success on knowledge of the latest resistance rates of the most common germs. These were 67 per cent E. coli to ampicillin and 40 per cent for E. coli to tetracycline and 53 or 91 per cent for Str. faecalis or Proteus spec. to tetracycline. Hence, these preparations will have to be abandoned for calculated therapy, say, for cholangitis.
