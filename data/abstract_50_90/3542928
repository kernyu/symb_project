Bacteria can display resistance to a wide spectrum of noxious agents and environmental conditions, and these properties are often mediated by genes located on extrachromosomal DNA elements called plasmids. Replication, vertical and horizontal transmission and evolution of these elements are discussed, and examples of the genes responsible for the resistance phenotypes are given. Selective forces that drive the evolution of new combinations of bacterial properties of particular importance in clinical situations are analysed.
