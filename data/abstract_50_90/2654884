Plasmid pPM114 carries the Escherichia coli 16S ribosomal RNA gene under the control of a T7 promoter. It can generate in vitro transcribed 16S rRNA that can be assembled into functional 30S ribosomal subunits. Two deletion mutants were derived from pPM114, by partial or total deletion of the conserved 900 stem/loop region of the 16S rRNA. These mutants, pMG delta 10 and pMG delta 23, respectively lack bases 895 to 904 and 889 to 911 of the 16S rRNA. The amputated 16S rRNA transcripts synthesized from these mutated plasmids were assembled into 30S subunits which were as active under the direction of an artificial or a natural messenger as subunits reconstructed with the full-length 16S rRNA transcript. They also responded as well to the stimulation of misreading by streptomycin, although the deleted region is proximal to the streptomycin binding domain. However, when we attempted to delete the 895-904 or 889-911 region from the 16S rRNA gene in plasmid pKK3535 which carries the rrnB operon, no transformants harbouring plasmids with one of these deletions could be recovered. These observations suggest that the 900 stem/loop region of the 16S rRNA is not required for the ribosomal function but is probably essential for important cell regulatory functions.
