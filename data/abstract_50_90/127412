Pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated from the viscera of diseased and dead birds (young and adult chickens) as well as from 9 poultry houses on seven farms. Its typing was performed on the basis of the blue-green coloration of the cultures, their hemolytic activity, the pleasant odour of lime-tree, the growth in culturing at 42 degrees C, the presence of the pyocianin pigment, and the positive results of the cytochromoxidase test after Gaby and Hadley and the biochemical test after Kovacs. The pathogenicity of the agent was demonstrated through the experimental parenteral infection of chicks, albino mice, and guinea pigs. Pseudomonas aeruginosa cultures showed weak sensitivity and good resistance to the various drugs tested. Most active proved streptomycin, kanamycin, and spectam.
