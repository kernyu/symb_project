Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains (240 in all) isolated from various clinical materials in the years 1986-1988 showed a high sensitivity to amikacin (92.3-100%), colistin (84.6-100%) and ceftazidim (84.6-100%). Netilmycin acted on 75.4% of the strains, and penicillins (carbenicillin, ticarcillin and azlocillin) similarly as gentamicin, tobramycin, cefotaxim, cefoperazon and ceftriaxon were active only against 51.3-66.7% of the tested strains.
