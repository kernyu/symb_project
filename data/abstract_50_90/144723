Small, closed circular deoxyribonucleic acid molecules, called miniplasmids, were observed in Escherichia coli harboring copy number mutants of the R plasmid NR1 after growth in medium containing tetracycline. The level of tetracycline resistance conferred by the copy mutant plasmids was lower (3 to 6 microgram/ml) than that conferred by NR1 (100 MICROGRAM/ML). The presence of the miniplasmid enhanced the level of tetracycline resistance conferred by the copy mutant. Miniplasmids of molecular weights 4 X 10(6) to 13 X 10(6) were found. They carried no antibiotic resistance markers and could be eliminated by growth in the presence of chloramphenicol and/or streptomycin-spectinomycin. Studies with the restriction endonucleases EcoRI and Sal I indicated that the miniplasmids are derived from the region of the copy mutant plasmids that contains the origin for replication of the resistance transfer factor. There were approximately 12 copies of the miniplasmid per chromosome, compared with 3 and 6 copies of the copy mutants of NR1. The miniplasmids appeared to be incompatible with the copy mutant plasmids.
