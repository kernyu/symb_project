The results of chemoantibiotic sensitivity tests carried out on 626 Salmonellae strains, isolated in 1973, 1974 and 1975 at the Bacteriol. Laboratory of S. Maria Nuova Hospital, Florence (Italy), are here related. The lowest percentages of antibiotic resistance have been noted to gentamycin and colimycin. Significant differences of antibiotic resistances were observed in single tested strains: the Salmonella wien strains were polyresistant, while the Salmonella panama strains showed a very high sensitivity to all the antibiotics. The conclusion is that in order to conduct a correct and useful antibiotic therapy, the microbic sensitivity test on isolated Salmonellae strains should be always performed.
