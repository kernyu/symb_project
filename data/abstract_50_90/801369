A study has been made of the effect of certain aminoglycoside antibiotics on the electrical properties of the surfaces of one sensitive, two resistant and one dependent form of E. coli K-12. The method employed was to observe the change in scattered light produced when the bacteria in suspension are orientated by an applied a. c. electric field. The effect of the antibiotics has been analysed in terms of drug accumulation at the bacterial surface. Differences have been noted in the responses of the sensitive form to different aminoglycosides and an attempt has been made to correlate these differences with mimimum inhibitory concentrations. Differences have also been noted in the response of certain resistant and dependent forms of E. coli to streptomycin.
