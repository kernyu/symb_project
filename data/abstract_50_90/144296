The authors report the results of a study about the association of acrylic cement with antibiotics. Three cements have been tested: Simplex, CMW, Palacos, with 14 different antibiotics. A series of experiments has been carried out in three phases: a macroscopic study of the polymerisation of the mixture; in vitro bacteriological studies; and mechanical studies (trials of resistance to traction, flexion, shock measuring the modulus of elasticity and hardness). In vivo bacteriological testings have been carried out on 10 patients. It has come out from this study that the polymerisation of cement, usually does not destroy antibiotics which remain active and that the mechanical properties of cement are modified in sundry manners. All additions of tested antibiotics modifie mechanical properties by about 25 p. 100 but some additions seem to be preferable. Improvements must still be made and confirmed by this type of research.
