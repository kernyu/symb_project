Mutants of Escherichia coli have been isolated containing streptomycin suppressors that exhibit novel phenotypes with respect to strA alleles. In one class of these mutants, the suppressor effect parallels a strong binding to the ribosome of an additional protein in at least stoichiometric amounts. Transduction experiments confirmed that the level of suppression and the degree of binding of this protein were correlated.
