The current knowledge on the antimicrobial activity of dactimicin is poor and limited to the study of its activity against gram-negative bacilli. The new acquisition about the use of aminoglycoside antibiotics in infections due to Staphylococci, induced us to evaluate the behavior of this drug against methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococci, in comparison with fortimicin A and amikacin. Dactimicin (ST 900) shows good antibacterial activity and a strong bactericidal effect at MIC concentrations in all strains tested.
