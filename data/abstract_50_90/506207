In vitro production of interferon by blood leukocytes from patients with lymphosarcoma, lymphogranulomatosis, leukemia, cancer tumours, pneumonia, as well as by leukocytes of mice with Rauscher leukemia, and mice in the condition of hyporeactivity to interferon inducer was studied. Alongside with quantitative differences in interferon production, biological differences in the properties of interferons produced of normal and sick humans and animals were revealed. The biological differences consist in that the interferon produced by leukocytes from cancer and leukemia patients interacting with homologous cell culture is conducive to more rapid formation of resistance to the indicator virus than the interferon produced by normal leukocytes. Thus, resistance of the homologous cell culture to the infection with the indicator vesicular stomatitis virus developed within 1--2 hours after contact with leukocyte interferon from patients and only within 5--6 hours after contact with that of normal subjects. This finding is not specific for cancer and leukemia, as the same was observed with specimens from patients with pneumonia and from mice hyporeactive to interferon inducer. It is suggested that patients with cancer and leukemia have a state of interferon hyporeactivity.
