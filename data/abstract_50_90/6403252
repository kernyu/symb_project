HeLa cells show a decrease of susceptibility to the killing by natural killer (NK) cells when treated with IFN-alpha, beta, or gamma. The concentrations at which preparations of IFN-alpha or beta induce the resistance to killing are those which also induce resistance of HeLa cells to infection by vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). Stimulation of the killing activity of NK cells is also induced at that same range of concentrations of IFN-alpha and beta. In contrast with preparations of IFN-gamma, induction of the resistance to killing occurs at IFN concentrations which have only marginal stimulatory effect on the activity of NK cells and have no antiviral effect against VSV. IFN-gamma, produced with cloned IFN-gamma cDNA, is as effective as lymphocyte-produced IFN in inducing the resistance to natural killing. The potent effect of IFN-gamma on the target cells is, therefore, not due to the function of lymphokines which might contaminate lymphocyte-produced preparations of IFN-gamma, but a genuine property of the IFN itself.
