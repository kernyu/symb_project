Clinical evaluation of ceftizoxime suppository (CZX-S), a new antibiotic rectal suppository, was performed in 5 cases with bacterial infections in pediatric field (2 with acute bronchitis, 1 with acute tonsillitis, UTI and pertussis, respectively) and the following results were obtained; Blood levels of CZX at 10-20 minutes after administration of CZX-S at a dose of 10.0-26.3 mg/kg in 5 cases were 3.26-23.3 micrograms/ml and the urinary excretion rates within 6 hours were 15.2, 60.1, 60.2% in 3 of 5 cases measured respectively. Clinical effects were excellent in 3 and good in 2 cases. Slight elevation of GOT and GPT was observed in 1 case. No other side effects were observed. The patients' tolerability against rectal suppository was good. From the above results, we concluded that CZX-S is useful for treating the pediatric patients with various infections.
