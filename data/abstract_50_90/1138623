Main filtration characteristics of the fermentation broths are necessary for estimation of the filtration equipment, rational choice of the filtering apparatus, determination of the optimal conditions for their exploitation. In this connection studies were carried out with a purpose of determining the specific resistance and the content of the solid phase in the fermentation broths of the main antibiotics. It was shown that the above characteristics were closely connected with the biosynthetic conditions and medium composition. It was noted that the specific resistance of the precipitates of the fermentation broths of various antibiotic-producing organisms significantly differed, sometimes by several orders. Preliminary treatment of the fermentation broths before filtration provided a marked decrease in the resistance of the precipitate.
