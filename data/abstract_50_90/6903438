Two studies were undertaken to determine the effect of antibiotic therapy in the mother on the enterobacteriaceae of the newborn's fecal flora. In the first, mothers were given tetracycline after delivery. Although the effect on the maternal flora was important there was no noticeable effect on the enterobacteriaceae of the newborn although the organisms were predominantly susceptible. In the second, mothers were given ampicillin before delivery and resistant enterobacteriaceae were predominant in all the newborns. In the controls born to untreated mothers susceptible organism still predominate. Antibiotic treatment of the mother has an important effect on the newborn's flora if the treatment is given before delivery.
