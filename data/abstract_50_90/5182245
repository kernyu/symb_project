Exposure of penicillinase-producing staphylococci to a combination of penicillin and oxytetracycline resulted in a synergistic inhibitory activity of the antibiotics on the bacteria. Oxytetracycline was employed in concentrations having little or no effect on bacterial growth. It was found that the synergistic antibacterial effect was caused by the preferential inhibition of penicillinase induction by oxytetracycline, rendering the staphylococci more susceptible to penicillin.
