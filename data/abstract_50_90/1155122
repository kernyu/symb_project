Two hundred and seven urinary strains of staphylococci and micrococci were classified biochemically according to Baird-Parker (1963) and by means of a simplified schema. One hundred and thirteen strains belonged to Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermids or S. saprophyticus (64 strains) according to the simplified schema, respectively to Baird-Parker's sub-groups SI, SII or M3. S. saprophyticus was isolated from young, female out-patients, was relatively resistant to novobiocin and contained poly AbetaC (beta-N-acetylglucosaminyl ribitol teichoic acid and beta-N-acetylglucosaminyl glycerol teichoic acid). S. aureus and S. epidermidis were isolated from older, male in-patients, were sensitive to novobiocin and contained poly A (N-acetylglucosaminyl ribitol teichoic acid), respectively poly B (glucosyl glycerol teichoic acid). Ninety-four strains belonging to other Staphylococcus or Micrococcus subgroups could not be classified by the simplified schema. With few exceptions, these strains were sensitive to novobiocin and either gave a precipitin reaction corresponding to poly C or were non-typable with the teichoic acid reference systems used. The simplified schema is recommended for the classification of coagulase-negative strains of Micrococcaceae.
