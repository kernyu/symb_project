A field study was performed to determine the effectiveness of benzathine cloxacillin for the treatment of infectious bovine keratoconjunctivitis in cattle from 2 farms located in northern California. The study was performed between June and September of 1987. Affected calves ranging from 2 to 9 months of age were selected from the main herd when signs of corneal ulceration were observed. The study was conducted in 2 phases. For phase I, the affected calves of herd 1 (n = 21; Holsteins) and herd 2 (n = 43 Angus crossbred), were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups, and were either treated with 250 (n = 23) or 375 mg (n = 21) of benzathine cloxacillin, or mineral oil (n = 20) on days 1 and 4. For phase II, affected calves (n = 16; Angus crossbred, 3 to 9 months of age) from herd 2 were treated with benzathine cloxacillin (250 mg). Eight of these calves were retreated on day 4. After treatment, all calves were examined every 72 hours for 16 days. For examinations, a clinical score was assigned to each eye, and the surface areas of photographed corneal ulcers were measured. The ocular secretions were collected and examined culturally for Moraxella bovis. On days 7, 10, and 13, the calves treated with benzathine cloxacillin had significantly (P less than 0.05) lower lesion scores, compared with the controls.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
