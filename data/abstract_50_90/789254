Until the last few years, chloramphenicol was recognized positively as the drug of choice in the treatment of acute typhoid fever. Its hematoxicity, as well as the recently observed epidemic and the present endemic occurrence of S. typhi strains with R-factor-mediated resistance to chloramphenicol in Mexico, India and South-EAst Asia, render the clinical evaluation of new antibacterial agents extremely important. By means of a literature review on controlled comparative trials, the value of thiamphenicol, ampicillin, amoxycillin, furazolidone and co-trimoxazole as alternative drugs for the treatment of acute typhoid fever is examined. Co-trimoxazole seems to be the drug of choice in the treatment of acute typhoid fever. For the treatment of the chronic typhoid carrier ampicillin is most frequently used, but amoxycillin and co-trimoxazole seem to be just as effective.
