It has been proposed that in addition to production of a penicillin-binding protein with low affinity for beta-lactam antibiotics, control of autolysin activity is involved in the mechanism of staphylococcal methicillin resistance. A homogeneous methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strain (DU4916) had lower rates of unstimulated, NaCl- and Triton X-100-stimulated autolysis, and daptomycin (LY146032)-induced lysis than a heterogeneous methicillin-resistant strain (DU4916-K7) and a methicillin-susceptible strain (DU4916S) derived from DU4916.
