Results of treatment of urinary tract infection in 110 patients using new beta-lactam antibiotics are presented in summary. While in the uncomplicated infections a cure rate approaching 100% was observed even with very small dosages, complicated cases required higher dosages to achieve satisfactory clinical cure rates and especially to achieve acceptable bacteriological cure rates. The continuous need for new, more potent antibiotics is becoming apparent due to the increasing resistance rates of pathogens to the existing agents. The group of beta-lactam antibiotics offers much hope due to the continuous development of numerous new compounds with better antibacterial and kinetic properties, offering at the same time a very high degree of safety, compared to aminoglycosides and most other antibiotic groups.
