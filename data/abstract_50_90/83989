Treatment of outer membranes of Serratia marcescens with polymyxin B results in the formation of blebs. This effect is thought to be due to the action of the antibiotic on the lipopolysaccharides, proteins, phospholipids or a combination thereof. It is unclear whether this effect is dissociative, degradative or due to an inhibition of the assembly of outer membrane components. Prior studies showed that lipopolysaccharides and polymyxin B form complexes, but direct visualization of the in situ action of polymyxin B had not been accomplished. Isolated outer membranes normally exhibit a periodicity of the polysaccharide molecules when stained by the thiosemicarbazide-silver technique. Polymyxin B treated outer membranes display a change in their basic morphology. This effect is very drastic in the sensitive strain as demonstrated by the large gaps in the deposition of the granules in the modified outer membrane structure. Thus it appears that the polysaccharide molecules (probably the lipopolysaccharide) either alone or in association with protein or phospholipids are the primary targets of the antibiotic.
