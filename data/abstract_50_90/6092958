Susceptibility of Candida albicans isolated from mouthrinse specimens during episodes of acute pseudomembranous candidiasis in patients with haematological malignancies was tested by the broth dilution and disc diffusion methods using 24 and 48 h of incubation. The time factor did not significantly affect the results with 5-fluorocytosine. With amphotericin B, prolonged incubation doubled the geometric mean MIC of C. albicans as well as the number of isolates with intermediate sensitivity. With the shorter incubation in the disc diffusion assay, few isolates showed lowered sensitivity to clotrimazole; at 48 h, however, this figure was as high as 54%. The yeasts were highly sensitive to ketoconazole at 24 h, whereas at 48 h the results were bizarre. At 24 h, correlations between disc diffusion and broth dilution methods were satisfactory, with clotrimazole and ketoconazole accounting for most of the discordancies. Accordingly, the disc diffusion results should be recorded at 24 h.
