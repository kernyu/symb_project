Subclones isolated from a Chinese hamster hybrid line, derived from fusion of an actinomycin D-resistant and an actinomycin D-sensitive strain, were studied with respect to their resistance to actinomycin D, karyology, transplantability and agglutination by concanavalin A. Statistical analysis of the results allowed the establishment of a classification of the strains based on increasing resistance to actinomycin D. There appeared to be an inverse correlation between actinomycin D-resistance and tumorigenicity and a positive correlation between this resistance and the presence of a marker chromosome.
