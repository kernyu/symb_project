The present paper reports on 34 cases of meningococcal meningitis admitted during the last three years to the Clinic of Communicable Diseases of Cluj. The incidence was higher in adolescents and young adults (76%). The clinical form was severe in 10 cases, medium in 19 cases and mild in 5 cases. All the patients recovered, with a mean duration of the disease of 9-12 days. No sequelae or relapses were recorded. The treatment was based upon penicillin G, 15 million U/day. In 17 cases sulfonamides were associated and in 5 cases chloramphenicol and ampicillin. In 29 cases intravenous, intramuscular or oral cortisone was administered and in 5 cases intrathecally. The results obtained in the cases treated only with penicillin were identical to those obtained by an associated therapy. Worthy of note was the decrease of the sensitivity of meningococci to sulfonamides and chloramphenicol and their increased resistance to tetracyclin and erythromycin.
