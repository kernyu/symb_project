Liver epitheloid tumor cells exposed to iododeoxyuridine revealed increased resistance to detachment from their growth substratum when exposed to low levels of EDTA. Two-dimensional analysis of the Triton-X-100 insoluble cytoskeleton from cells grown with iododeoxyuridine revealed an increased level of cathodic fibronectin and a more anodic migration of actin-like components concurrent with the reduced expression of an anodic 50K component and of a cathodic 60K component.
