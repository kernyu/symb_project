This study evaluated the efficacy of and tolerance to moxalactam in the treatment of uncomplicated gonorrhea, including two infections with penicillin-resistant strains. After appropriate cultures, 87 women and 64 men each received 1 gm of moxalactam intramuscularly as a single injection. Penicillinase-producing Neisseria gonorrhoeae was isolated from one man who had persistent urethritis after therapy with ampicillin. Another isolate showed high relative resistance to penicillin. At follow-up in three to seven days, moxalactam eradicated N gonorrhoeae from all 120 evaluable patients including the two with penicillin resistance and five women with rectal gonorrhea. Moxalactam administered intramuscularly was well tolerated and the few adverse effects were usually mild. In this study, 1 gm of moxalactam appeared to be virtually 100% effective and safe for therapy of adults with uncomplicated anogenital gonorrhea.
