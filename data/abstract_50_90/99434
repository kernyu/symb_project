The UV survival curves of different strains of myxobacteria exhibited shoulders; in the case of Polyangium luteum, an unusual double shoulder appeared. Repair inhibitors like acriflavine, caffeine, and coumarin reduced the survival of UV-irradiated cells if the drugs were incorporated in the post-irradiation plating medium. The shoulders were reduced, but the final inactivation slopes were not affected by the repair inhibitors. Those strains that were resistant to UV were also more resistant to being killed by nitrosoguanidine. A variety of drug-resistant mutants occurred. The spontaneous mutation frequencies to drug resistance varied with the drug and the strain used. Drug-resistant mutants were inducible by UV irradiation and nitrosoguanidine. The UV mutability of Myxococcus xanthus was high compared to Cystobacter sp. However, the nitrosoguanidine mutability of M. xanthus was low compared to the other strains.
