The increasing significance of infections with non-sporing anaerobic bacteria is a very important problem for clinicians and microbiologists too. The author deals with the properties of anaerobic bacteria and gives a review of our present knowledge in the fields of clinical symptoms, the mechanisms of pathogenicity. Especially, emphasis is laid on the collection and transportation of specimens for anaerobic cultures. Possibilities of rapid laboratory diagnosis are described as well as the exact bacteriological diagnosis and the in-vitro testing in case of antimicrobial susceptibility. Remarks on the clinical significance and chemotherapy of anaerobic infections complete this review.
