Concern over the appearance of resistant bacteria in domestic animals and birds led in Great Britain to the establishment of a Government Committee of Enquiry on the use of antibiotics in Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Medicine known as the Swan Committee. This Committee made a number of recommendations about surveillance and control of diseases of animals communicable to man which included the establishment of a system of data collection. These recommendations were incorporated in a legal statute, the Zoonoses Order of 1975. Data on the incidence of salmonellosis and of antibiotic resistance in Great Britain are presented in this paper together with a consideration of the epidemiology of salmonellosis and its control.
