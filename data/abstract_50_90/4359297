The effect of interferon on simian virus 40 (SV40) and adenovirus 2 (Ad2) T antigen synthesis has been examined in cells infected with SV40, with Ad2, and with a nondefective Ad2-SV40 hybrid virus, Ad2(+)ND(4). The induction of SV40 T antigen by SV40 was highly sensitive to interferon, whereas the induction of Ad2 T-antigen by Ad2 was resistant. This difference in interferon sensitivity was also noted in cells simultaneously infected with both viruses. However, the induction of SV40 T antigen by Ad2(+)ND(4), which contains covalently linked SV40 and Ad2 DNAs, was as resistant to interferon as the induction of Ad2 T antigen. This change in the interferon sensitivity of SV40 T antigen synthesis suggests that the expression of at least this portion of the SV40 genetic information in Ad2(+)ND(4) is under Ad2 genetic control. When RNA extracted from Ad2(+)ND(4)-infected cells was examined by means of sequential hybridization with Ad2 DNA, elution, and rehybridization with SV40 DNA, 27% of the SV40-specific RNA was found to be linked to Ad2 RNA. No such linkage was detected in control mixtures of Ad2 and SV40 RNAs. The presence of Ad2 and SV40 nucleotide sequences in the same RNA molecule implies that, in Ad2(+)ND(4) infection, transcription is initiated in the DNA of one virus (Ad2 or SV40) and continues without interruption across the point of junction into the DNA of the other virus. Furthermore, the interferon resistance of Ad2(+)ND(4)-induced SV40 T antigen synthesis suggests that transcription of the genetic information for SV40 T antigen is initiated in a region of Ad2 DNA.
