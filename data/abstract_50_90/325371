Strains carrying both the ramA1 and the neaA301 mutations do not exhibit the restriction of informational suppressors normally associated with resistance to neamine. Furthermore, ribosomes from such strains exhibit increased misreading in vitro with respect to particles from the neaA strain. These properties suggest that translational fidelity may be cooperatively controlled by ribosomal proteins S4 and S17, coded by ramA (rpsd) and neaA (rpsq) genes respectively.
