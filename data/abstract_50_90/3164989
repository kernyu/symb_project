Ciprofloxacin was more effective (P less than 0.01) than either imipenem or nafcillin therapy of experimental methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus endocarditis in rabbits after 2 or 3 days of treatment. There was no significant difference between results of treatment of methicillin-susceptible S. aureus experimental endocarditis with ciprofloxacin and results with the combination of nafcillin and gentamicin. Ciprofloxacin was more effective (P less than 0.01) than vancomycin therapy of experimental methicillin-resistant S. aureus endocarditis after 3 days of treatment. After 5 days of treatment, there was no significant difference between the results of treatment of experimental methicillin-resistant S. aureus endocarditis with ciprofloxacin and results with vancomycin.
