Methods for screening compounds against Eimeria tenella in cell culture and in the chicken are described. An analysis for incidence of anticoccidial activity and host cell toxicity has been made of 11550 compounds screened in vitro, and some correlation of activity in vitro and in vivo has been attempted. The results show that screening compounds in tissue (cell) culture is not a satisfactory or reliable alternative to screening in chickens, although in vitro studies undoubtedly have a part to play in the evaluation of an active drug.
