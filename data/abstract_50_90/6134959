Single-dose ceftriaxone, 125 mg or 250 mg intramuscularly (IM), was compared with spectinomycin, 2 g IM, for treatment of men with uncomplicated urethral or anorectal infections due to penicillinase-negative Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Cure rates were 100% for 31 and 28 men treated with 125 mg and 250 mg ceftriaxone, respectively, and 97% for 58 men given spectinomycin. Among patients followed up for greater than or equal to 14 days, post-gonococcal urethritis occurred in 25% of 44 men treated with ceftriaxone and 19% of 47 given spectinomycin (p = NS). The geometric mean minimum inhibitory concentration of ceftriaxone for 79 pre-treatment isolates of N gonorrhoeae was 0.0058 microgram/ml, and all strains were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.063 micrograms/ml. Neither drug caused perceptible toxicity, but patient acceptance was greater for ceftriaxone than for spectinomycin. Ceftriaxone in a single dose of 125 mg is effective against uncomplicated urethral or anorectal gonorrhoea in men and may become a regimen of choice for this infection.
