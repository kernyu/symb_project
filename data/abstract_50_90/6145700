A method for polyethylene glycol-induced protoplast transformation of glutamate-producing bacteria with plasmid DNA was established. Protoplasts were prepared from cells grown in the presence of penicillin by treatment with lysozyme in a hypertonic medium. The concentration of penicillin during growth affected the efficiency of formation, regeneration, and polyethylene glycol-induced DNA uptake of protoplasts. Regeneration of protoplasts was accomplished on a hypertonic agar medium containing sodium succinate and yeast extract. The spectinomycin and streptomycin resistance plasmid pCG4, originally from Corynebacterium glutamicum T250, could transform various glutamate-producing bacteria such as C. glutamicum, Corynebacterium herculis, Brevibacterium flavum, and Microbacterium ammoniaphilum. The plasmid was structurally unchanged and stably maintained in new hosts. The transformation frequency of most competent protoplasts with pCG4 DNA isolated from primary transformants was high (ca. 10(6) transformants per microgram of covalently closed circular DNA) but was still two orders of magnitude below the frequency of transfection with modified DNA of the bacteriophage phi CGI. The difference was ascribed to the involvement of regeneration in transformation.
