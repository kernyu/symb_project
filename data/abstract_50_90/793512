It was found that the rate of emergence of streptomycin resistant clones in the populations of fresh isolates of Shigella Zonne amounted to 10(-6)--10(-4). Such streptomycin resistant clones masked streptomycin resistance of the initial Shigella population. The main biological properties of the streptomycin resistant clones were identical to those of the initial population.
