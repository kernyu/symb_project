Induction frequency of mutants of Candida tropicalis D-2 strain depends on the number of intracellular lipids and the nature of a chemical mutagen. Para-aminobenzoic acid leads to a decrease in the lethality and mutagenicity of nitrosocompounds, which is stronger expressed in cells with enhanced quantity of lipids. Among nystatin and levorin-resistant mutants obtained independently, the mutants with supersensitivity to other antibiotics were discovered. The majority of mutants possess cross-resistance.
