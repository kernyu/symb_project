Due to the mainly infectious genesis drug-therapy with antibiotics is essential in chronic non-specific respiratory diseases. But they are only indicated when a bacterial infection is suspected. The broad spectrum antibiotics usually have a reliable efficacy. Bacteriological examination is no obligate supposition. But it is necessary if new drugs with limited effectiveness are intended to be given. In most cases of chronic bronchitis an intermittent application is sufficient.

The possibility of antibiotic therapy in respiratory virus infections is inquired.
