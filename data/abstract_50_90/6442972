Resistance to the antibiotics most widely used in chemotherapy of the "Bacillus subtilis" strains constituting the specialty Enterogermina was measured by the method of diffusion on agar plates. The results obtained demonstrate that the mutations to resistance present in such strains confer a broad spectrum of resistance to the most important classes of antibiotics. We were also able to demonstrate a considerable number of antibiotic resistances which had not been previously recognized. For the most representative antibiotics, resistance levels were determined in comparison to the sensitive strains. The multiple resistance phenotype of the strains studied is discussed in relation to the molecular basis of antibiotic resistance.
