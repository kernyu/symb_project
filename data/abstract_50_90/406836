A modified 1-min iodometric paper strip test for penicillinase activity was developed for detection of beta-lactamase-producing isolates of Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. The test is simple to perform and uses reagent-impregnated strips that may be stored for 1 year or more prior to use.
