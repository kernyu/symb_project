A comparative evaluation of daptomycin and eight other antimicrobial agents was performed by the agar dilution technique with 56 strains of vancomycin-resistant gram-positive bacteria, including Leuconostoc, Lactobacillus, and Pediococcus spp. Erythromycin, deptomycin, clindamycin, and gentamicin exhibited the greatest activities, whereas penicillin, ampicillin, and cefotaxime showed moderate activities. The organisms were all highly resistant to vancomycin and cefoxitin.
