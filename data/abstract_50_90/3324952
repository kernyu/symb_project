Chemotherapeutic efficacy of mecillinam and dioxidine was studied on a model of Escherichia coli septicemia of albino mice caused by polyresistant variants of E. coli 675. It was shown that the presence of RI plasmid in the bacterial cells markedly lowered the mecillinam chemotherapeutic efficacy whereas the presence of R64 plasmid did not change the drug efficacy as compared to the plasmid-free controls. It was noted that the presence of RI and R222 plasmids in the pathogen cells increased the dioxidine efficacy while pKM-101 plasmid had a contrary effect. Correlation between the level of dioxidine resistance of E. coli 675 in vitro and the drug chemotherapeutic efficacy in animals was observed.
