The resistance-inducing capacity of ciprofloxacin is still controversial. In order to assess the changes in susceptibility behavior, ciprofloxacin was given as antibiotic cover for transurethral maneuvers in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients with urinary tract infection prone to recurrence after treatment. The aim was to compare the susceptibility pattern before and after treatment in a double-blind study using two different dose regimens. Sixty-one patients were randomly separated in two groups who received 100 and 500 mg ciprofloxacin orally, twice a day for 4 days. Bacterial cultures were performed before and at the fourth day of treatment as well as at 6 days and 4 weeks after the end of treatment. Altered susceptibility behavior, defined as an elevation of the primary minimum inhibitory concentration by at least two dilution steps, was only found in three causative organisms out of 86, demonstrating the low resistance-inducing capacity of ciprofloxacin. There was no significant dosage-related difference.
