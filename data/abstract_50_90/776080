Intracellular contents of polyamine dancyl derivatives were determined by the method of thin-layer chromatography in Coli and typhoid fever bacteria sensitive to antibiotics and their variants resistant to streptomycin, levomycetin, chlortetracyline and neomycin. Increased levels of spermidine and putrescin in the antibiotic resistant cultures were found. The increased levels of the polyamines correlated with changes in the content of nucleic acids. It is supposed that the increase in the content of the polyamines in the antibiotic resistant bacteria was the result of accumulation of nucleic acids by them.
