The authors report the case of an 8 month-old infant presenting with mycobacterium avium-intracellulare pulmonary infection. The etiological diagnosis relies upon isolation of the organism. The cutaneous reactions to avian tuberculin are only a guiding factor. Evolution was favorable in spite of the resistance of the bacteria to antituberculous chemotherapy. The epidemiological research carried out in a neighbouring chicken-run was negative.
