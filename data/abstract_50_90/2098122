A total of 209 H. influenzae strains isolated from follow-up patients were studied. Twenty eight strains were serotype b (13.4%), 82 corresponded to type I of Kilian (39.2%), and 41 produced beta-lactamase (19.6%). Strains were resistant to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (SXT) in 79.9% of cases, to the erythromycin in 18.2%, to tetracycline in 16.7%, to chloramphenicol in 13.8%, and to cefaclor in 0.1% of instances. There were no strains resistant to cefotaxime nor to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. Resistances to three or more antibiotics were observed in 14.8% of the strains. The most common of these combinations was ampicillin-chloramphenicol-tetracycline SXT (61.3%).
