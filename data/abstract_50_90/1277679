Five cases of acute hematogenous osteomyelitis occurring at the site of closed fractures are reported. This is a serious and potentially lethal complication resulting in directly in the death of 3 of the 5 patients. This is an unusual occurrence seen infrequently, and subsequent delay in diagnosis is frequent. An awareness of this complication (which usually occurs in the face of decreased resistance to infection) coupled with careful inspection of the fracture site, evaluation of the patient as a whole, and a high index of suspicion will allow earlier diagnosis and possibly more successful early treatment. Because of the pathophysiology of this lesion and the usual delay in diagnosis, initial treatment should include wide surgical drainage of the abscess with proper debridement and bony resection. This may involve procedures which at first glance may appear to be mutilating. In these patients with decreased resistance to infection, the initial appropriate choice of antibiotics is essential.
