The results of testing all urinary pathogens from general practice and hospital practice for their sensitivity to a range of antimicrobial agents over the four years 1971-74 are presented. The changes observed in each situation with the passage of time are discussed. Resistance has become more frequent to those drugs to which resistance is commonly R factor-mediated. Less change has been observed in resistance to other antimicrobial agents.
