Analysis of exponential and synchronous cultures of Escherichia coli B/r after the addition of FL1060 indicates a block point for division by this agent some 15 to 20 min before the end of the preceding cell division cycle, a time corresponding to the beginning of the C period of the cell division cycle. Morphological examination of FL1060-treated synchronous cultures of E. coli /r was consistent with inhibition by FL1060 of a very early event in the cell division cycle. This event appears to be essential for normal cell surface elongation in a rod configuration. Temporary treatment of synchronous cultures of E. coli B/r with FL1060 resulted in division delay, the extent of which was a function of the duration of exposure to FL1060. However, even after relatively long times of FL1060 treatment the delayed divisions were still synchronous. Although FL1060 had no direct effect on deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) synthesis, the synchronous delayed division occuring after temporary treatment with FL1060 were accompanied by a delay in the attainment of resistance of cell division to inhibitors of DNA, ribonucleic acid, and protein synthesis. These results suggest aht an FL1060-sensitive event initiates at the beginning of the C period of the cell division cycle of E. coli and is responsible for normal cell elongation. This cell elongation pathway procedes independently of DNA synthesis, but there is an interaction between this pathway and termination of a round of DNA replication in which a normal rod configuration is necessary to allow a signal for cell division to be generated upon completion of DNA replication.
