The authors study the possibilities of cephalosporin antibiotic cefamandol, new for our clinical practice, in the treatment of uroinfections. The microbiological study on a total of 2301 bacterial strains, isolated from patients with uroinfections, reveals that cefamandol excels in its action against gram-positive microorganisms, all beta-lactam antibiotics, used in our country. As regards E. coli, Citrobacter, Klebsiella, Enterobacter, P. mirabilis and indole positive pro cefamandol is better than ampicillin, carbencillin and cefalotin. A resistance to the preparation showed the majority of the isolates of Enterococcus, Serratia, Acinebacter and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Excellent result was attained in 60% of all the 35 patients with uroinfections treated, manifested in "sterilization" of urine and in 5.71% bacteruiria became insignificant. In parallel, the clinical and laboratory symptoms of uroinfection were favourably influenced. The preparation has a good tolerance. Finally it should be underlined that this antibiotic must be introduced in the routine clinical practice for the treatment of adequate forms of uroinfections.
