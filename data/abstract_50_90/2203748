An Escherichia coli uracil-DNA glycosylase-defective mutant (ung-1 thyA) was more resistant than its wild-type counterpart (ung+ thyA) to the killing effect of UV light when cultured in medium containing 5-bromouracil or 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdUrd). The phenotype of resistance to BrdUrd photosensitization and the uracil-DNA glycosylase deficiency appeared to be 100% cotransduced by P1 phage. During growth with BrdUrd, both strains exhibited similar growth rates and 5-bromouracil incorporation into DNA. The resistant phenotype of the ung-1 mutant was observed primarily during the stationary phase. In cells carrying 5-bromouracil-substituted DNA, mutations causing resistance to rifampin and valine were induced by UV irradiation at a higher frequency in the wild type than in the ung-1 mutant. This Ung-dependent UV mutagenesis required UmuC function. These results suggest that the action of the uracil-DNA glycosylase on UV-irradiated 5-bromouracil-substituted DNA produces lethal and mutagenic lesions. The BrdUrd photosensitization-resistant phenotype allowed us to develop a new, efficient method for enriching and screening ung mutants.
