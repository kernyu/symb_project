Prevention and treatment of burn wound infection requires knowledge of the epidemiology of such infections. Prevention of infection rests on removal of reservoirs or sources of microorganisms from the burn patient's environment and interruption of transfer of microorganisms to the surface of the wound. When prevention fails and burn wound infection develops, successful therapy may depend on an understanding of the epidemiology of the burn wound during therapy. Contrary to the oft stated concept that antibiotics penetrate the avascular burn wound poorly, our study demonstrated that gentamicin and tobramycin achieved therapeutic concentrations in burn wound tissue. As in other types of infections, susceptible microorganisms were eradicated and resistant microorganisms persisted. Of most importance was the observation that resistant microorganisms may repopulate the wound within four days of starting therapy. It would appear that failure of therapy is not due to failure of antibiotics to penetrate the burn wound but rather to rapid development of superinfection during therapy.
