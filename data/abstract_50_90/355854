A conditional lethal mutator, dnaQ49, was found in Escherichia coli K12. The dnaQ49 mutation caused stimulation of rifampicin-, nalidixic acid- and streptomycin-resistant mutation frequencies 100 to 2000 fold at 30 degrees C and the frequencies were further increased 50 to 100 fold at 35 degrees C or higher temperatures. Cells carrying dnaQ49 were unable to grow in salt-free L-broth at 44.5 degrees C, and DNA synthesis but not protein synthesis of the cells was suppressed under the restrictive conditions. The dnaQ gene was located at about 5 min on the E. coli linkage map and the order of the genes residing in this region was determined to be ton A-dnaE-metD-dnaQ-pro A.
