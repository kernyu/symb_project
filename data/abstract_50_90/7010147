The ability of methyl benzimidazol-2-yl carbamate (MBC) to induce point mutations to carboxin and MBC resistance was tested in Aspergillus nidulans (Eidam) Winter and Cladosporium cucumerinum Ellis & Arth. A sub-lethal concentration (E.D.50) of MBC, when incorporated into a complete agar medium, induced MBC resistance in germinating conidia of A. nidulans and carboxin resistance in germinating conidia of C. cucumerinum. The significance of these findings in relation to fungicide resistance in the fields is discussed.
