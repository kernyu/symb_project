The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of sulfadiazine, penicillin, and rifampin for meningococcal strains isolated from civilians during 1970 were compared. The strains were isolated from various sources and geographical areas and represented several serogroups. The ranges of MIC values were as follows: 0.05 to 20 mg/100 ml for sulfadiazine, 0.01 to 0.4 mug/ml for penicillin, and 0.01 to 0.8 mug/ml for rifampin. There was no significant relationship between MIC values of sensitive or resistant sulfadiazine strains and the MIC values to the other two antimicrobial agents. Comparisons of sulfadiazine MIC values with inhibition zones around sulfathiazole discs showed excellent correlation, provided the strains were separated into sensitive and resistant groups on the basis of growth at 1 mg/100 ml. Regression curves for penicillin and rifampin sensitivity showed homologous sensitive populations with the strains studied.
