Combined metronidazol-penicillin, used in large amounts corresponding to the selective concentrations in vitro of 25 + 25 IU, may be assumed to be effective in all clinical infections in which one or several anaerobes are implicated. The experiments carried out demonstrate that this is valid for all categories of Grampositive or Gramnegative non-sporulate anaerobes. The antibiotic concentrations used are well tolerated by the human organism.
