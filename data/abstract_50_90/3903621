The activity of five cephalosporins has been studied with 80 coagulase-negative methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus strains (SCN meti-R) isolated from hospitalized patients. It has been evaluated in vitro under different conditions, in liquid as well as solid media. Results show that in all cases cefamandole has the highest activity on SCN meti-R. Thus cefamandole is quite effective for the prophylaxis of Staphylococcal infections. Furthermore the association of cefamandole with other antibiotics should be tested as an alternative to vancomycin for the treatment of SCN meti-R severe infections.
