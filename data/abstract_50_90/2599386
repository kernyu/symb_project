After testing various chemotherapeutics the following conclusions could be drawn: Pseudomonas was sensitive only to gentamicin. Gentamicin, aminopenicilline + calvulanacid and cefoxitin were 100% effective against E. coli. Gentamicin also proved effective against Enterobacter (83%). Cefoxitin, aminopenicillin + clavulanacid, gentamicin and trimethoprim + sulfonamide were effective against Klebsiella. Concerning Proteus sp., cefoxitin showed best results (100%). Acinetobacter was 100% inhibited by gentamicin. Gentamicin was most effective (93% sensitivity) against Staph. aureus. Trimethoprim + sulfonamide and erythromycine showed resistance rate of 17%, cefalosporine and isoxazolylpenicilline a rate of 21%. Aminopenicillin and aminopenicilline + calvulanacid were most suitable against Enterococcus (100%).
