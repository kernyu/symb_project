The in vitro antibacterial activity of eight newer beta-lactam antibiotics (mecillinam, piperacillin, mezlocillin, cefoxitin, cefotaxime, moxalactam, ceftriaxone and ceftazidime) was determined against 87 cephalothin-resistant strains of Enterobacteriaceae isolated during 6 months in a general hospital. Ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, moxalactam and ceftazidime proved to be highly active; only a minority of strains required higher concentrations than 0.125 microgram/ml for inhibition of growth. Cefoxitin, mecillinam, mezlocillin and piperacillin were less active. Mecillinam displayed greater efficacy against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella and Enterobacter spp., while the same was the case for piperacillin against Proteus mirabilis and Serratia marcescens, and for cefoxitin against indole-positive Proteus spp. The production of beta-lactamase was correlated with a reduced activity of mecillinam, mezlocillin and piperacillin but not of cefoxitin or the other beta-lactamase-stable cephalosporins. However, some strains, mainly those of Proteus, Enterobacter and Serratia, though resistant to mecillinam, mezlocillin and piperacillin did not produce beta-lactamases. This observation might indicate that ceftriaxone, moxalactam, cefotaxime and ceftazidime, besides their indifference to beta-lactamases, are characterized also by a high degree of intrinsic activity.
