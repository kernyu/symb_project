The firA (Ts)200 mutation not only eliminates the resistance to rifampin of certain genetically resistant strains, but, moreover, renders ribonucleic acid synthesis thermolabile. The firA gene has been mapped by P1 tranduction and is located extremely close to the structural gene for deoxyribonucleic acid polymerase III at 4 min on the Escherichia coli linkage map.
