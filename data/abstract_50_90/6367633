pKMR207-1, pKMR208-1, pKMR209, pKMR210 and pKMR212 plasmids controlling simultaneously antibiotic resistance and capacity for synthesis of the colonization antigen were detected in wild strains of E. coli of various serotypes. The properties of compatibility of plasmids pKMR to each other and their attitude to the known incompatibility groups were studied. It was shown that pKMR207-1, pKMR208-1, pKMR210 and pKMR212 plasmids were incompatible. These plasmids had the incompatibility properties with respect to R388 (Inc FI) plasmid and probably belonged to the incompatibility group Inc. FI. pKMR209 plasmid was compatible with pKMR207-1, pKMR208-1, pKMR210 and pKMR212 plasmids and belonged to another incompatibility group.
