It was shown for some oncogenic Agrobacterium tumefaciens strains that agrocin 84 sensitivity is determined by the presence of a large closed circular DNA plasmid, called the Ti-plasmid. Whereas wild-type strain C58 is agrocin 84 sensitive, all Ti-plasmid cured derivatives were found to be fully resistant. Moreover all independently isolated agrocin 84 resistant colonies were stably non-oncogenic and plasmid negative. In a growth experiment carried out at 37 degrees C it was shown that the kinetics of appearance of non-oncogenic cells on the one hand and of agrocin 84 resistant cells on the other were identical. The fact that not all oncogenic, plasmid harbouring, Agrobacterium tumefaciens strains are sensitive to agrocin 84, points to the possibility that the genes determining agrocin 84 sensitivity are not essential for tumor-inducing ability.
