The effect of unithiol and acetylcysteine on lipid peroxidation, thioldisulfide equilibrium, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, glutathione reductase and lactate dehydrogenase activity and on erythrocyte resistance was studied in guinea-pigs during sensitization with C. maltosa. Sensibilized animals receiving thiol antioxidants showed partial restoration of normal biochemical levels.
