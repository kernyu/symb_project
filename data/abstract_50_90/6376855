Twenty-four pediatric patients with infections were treated with ceftazidime (CAZ) by one-shot intravenous injection in the doses of 39 approximately 149 mg/kg/day in 4 divided doses as a rule. These patients' ages ranged from 2 months to 13 years 4 months. The duration of the administration ranged from 4 to 19 days, and total doses ranged from 1.38 to 57 g. Infections consisted of respiratory tract infections in 19 cases (acute tonsillitis in 3, acute bronchitis in 7, and pneumonia in 9), urinary tract infection in 1 case, acute peritonitis in 1 case, and suspected sepsis in 3 cases. Clinical efficacy was excellent in 18, good in 1, fair in 1, and poor in 4 cases, and the efficacy rate (excellent + good) was 79.2%. Bacteriological response was evaluated on 14 strains of bacteria isolated from lesions, assumed as the causative organisms (7 strains of S. aureus, 3 of P. aeruginosa, 1 of H. influenzae, 1 of K. pneumoniae, 1 of E. coli, and 1 of S. marcescens). Out of these strains, 10 were eradicated, and 1 (P. aeruginosa) decreased, but 2 strains (both S. aureus) persisted. (One strain of S. aureus was not examined.) No adverse effect suspected to be related to the drug was observed either in subjective symptom or in objective findings.
