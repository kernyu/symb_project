Six cases are described of Pseudomonas aeruginosa ulcerative keratitis in which antibiotic sensitivity studies demonstrate organism resistance to gentamicin sulfate but sensitivity to other aminoglycosides such as tobramycin and amikacin. In four cases, community-acquired infections represent the source of these ulcers. This paper documents the emergence of aminoglycoside resistance among Pseudomonas aeruginosa keratitis within the general community.
