Of 7 plasmids we tested, the plasmid pORF2 was eliminated in vitro with the most efficiency by treatment with subinhibitory concentrations of novobiocin, coumermycin and 10 quinolones. It showed a cure rate of 43% by enoxacin; 12% by novobiocin, pefloxacin, ciprofloxacin and CI-934; 7% by coumermycin and ofloxacin; 9% by amifloxacin; and 4% by AM-833. On the other hand, pSC194, pBR322 and pMH612 were poorly cured in vitro by quinolones, except pSC194 which was cured 33% by enoxacin. R1, pP1603, and pUB110 were unaffected by the treatment. Mice were challenged intraperitoneally with a 2XLD50 of Escherichia coli carrying the ORF2 plasmid and were treated per os with 1 X or 1/2 X ED50 of either enoxacin or CI-934. The frequency of loss of ampicillin resistance determined 3 h after treatment shows curing effects of 92% for CI-934, 89% for enoxacin and 20% for untreated control.
