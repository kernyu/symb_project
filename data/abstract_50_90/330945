The plasma DDS clearance rates and the acetylation rates of Sulphadimidine were studied in a group of 30 leprosy patients comprising of 17 non-responders and 13 responders to DDS treatment. No differences in the acetylator type or in the plasma DDS clearance were seen between the responders and non-responders. Acetylation rate did not bear any relation to the plasma clearance of DDS in the non-responders. The findings indicate that the resistance to DDS therapy in these patients is not related to any abnormal metabolic disposition of DDS.
