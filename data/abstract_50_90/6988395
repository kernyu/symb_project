Four caffeine-resistant haploid isolates, two resistant to 50 mM caffeine and two resistant to 100 mM caffeine, were genetically analyzed. Complementation and tetrad analysis indicated that all four mutations are alleles of the same locus. All four isolates demonstrated incomplete dominance when hybridized to the wild-type strain and dominance of high to low resistance when hybridized to one another. Differences in caffeine resistance were found between wild-type grande cells and its petite derivative.
