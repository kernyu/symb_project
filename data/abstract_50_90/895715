The growth of two strains of the "petite-negative" yeast Kluyveromyces lactis is inhibited by Tetracycline in different ways under the same culture conditions. Tetracycline resistant mutants of one strain have been isolated which can tolerate doses as high as 3000 microgram/ml of antibiotic. The segregation pattern of this character obtained by random spore analysis of the ascospores derived from the cross of the two strains strongly suggests that the resistance to tetracycline is under mitochondrial control.
