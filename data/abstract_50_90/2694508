In the search for an effective, safe and field-adapted alternative to chloroquine for therapy of chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium falciparum infections in Africa, a 3-d oral regimen of Quinimax (an association of quinine, quinidine and cinchonine) was evaluated in 35 individuals with P. falciparum in Madagascar, an area with chloroquine resistance. 63% of the parasite strains isolated were resistant in vitro to chloroquine, and 59% of the infections were present despite previous chloroquine intake. Three daily oral doses of 10 mg/kg Quinimax for 3 d cleared parasitaemia and improved clinical status in all subjects. Mean parasite and fever clearance times were 51.7 and 37.4 h, respectively. All patients were aparasitaemic at the end of the 7-d follow-up. When formulating therapy guidelines, the 3-d Quinimax regimen should be considered as a valuable alternative to chloroquine for treating falciparum malaria in African areas with clinical resistance to chloroquine.
