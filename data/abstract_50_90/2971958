The incidence and clinical aspects of malaria in patients returning from chemoresistance areas were evaluated by means of two studies. The first one was a prospective study of 145 subjects back from a 4 months' stay in Gabon and who had complied with an appropriate chemoprophylaxis regimen. Twelve of these subjects were found to have particulate P. falciparum antigens on the 3rd day following their return. Spontaneous negativation of parasitaemia was observed in 10 cases, whereas 2 subjects were about to develop a malarial attack. Forty-five days after the return home, 5 new cases of malarial attack and 3 cases of anaemia had occurred, although none of these 8 patients had haematozoa on the 3rd day. In the second study 31 patients admitted to hospital in 1987 were reviewed. The following clinical syndromes were detected: malarial attacks with high parasitaemia in 6 cases, malarial attacks with low or undetectable parasitaemia in 5 cases, anaemia, thrombocytopenia or pancytopenia in 5 cases, and febrile alteration of the general condition in 3 cases. Two aspects of malaria were identified: "malaria infection" with a latent and asymptomatic parasitic infestation likely to disappear spontaneously or to turn into "malaria disease". The latter has protean manifestations, but bouts of fever with low parasitaemia and blood disorders are predominant.
