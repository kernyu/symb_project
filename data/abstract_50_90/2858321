Chickens weighing approx. 1500 g were fasted 64 hr and then continuously infused with [6-3H]glucose to determine effects of ethanol on plasma glucose concentrations and on rates of glucose turnover. Ethanol infusions (222 or 444 mumol/min X kg-1 body weight) did not cause hypoglycemia although the high dose infusion slightly decreased the rate of glucose turnover. Metabolite ratios measured in livers of chickens infused with the high dose of ethanol indicated that the hepatic cytosolic redox state was relatively unchanged. Chickens have an unusual resistance to ethanol-induced hypoglycemia.
