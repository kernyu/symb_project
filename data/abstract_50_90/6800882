Bacillus subtilis mutants resistant to 100 mkg/ml of roseoflavin/8-dimethylamino (nor) riboflavin/have been shown to excrete 0.5 to 20 mkg/ml riboflavin and small amounts of FMN and FAD into the culture medium. The rosR mutations are localized in the operator region of riboflavin operon. The combination of rosR and ribC mutations (the latter being mutation in the regulator gene) leads to hyperproduction of riboflavin.
