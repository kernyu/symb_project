Clinical trial of cefoperazone (CPZ) for the treatment of whooping cough and whooping cough syndrome was performed and the following results were obtained. 1) In 18 cases suffering from whooping cough, CPZ was given 47 approximately 106 mg/kg/day (average 72 mg/kg/day) by intravenous route. The clinical efficacy rates judged by doctors in charge were 44% on the 3 rd day, 75% on the 7 th day, 86% on the period day. And in these cases, the clinical efficacy rates judged by committee members were 56%, 83% and 86%. 2) In 6 cases diagnosed as whooping cough syndrome, CPZ was given 49 approximately 96 mg/kg/day (average 59 mg/kg/day) by the same route. The clinical efficacy rates judged by doctors in charge were 67% on the 3 rd day, 80% on the 7 th day and 75% on the period day. And in these cases, those judged by committee members were 83%, 80% and 100%. 3) In 1 case, Bordetella pertussis was searched and showed 0.012 mcg/ml of MIC. It was eliminated on the 1 st day after administration. 4) Doctors in charge judged the utility of CPZ for whooping cough. Twelve cases were useful and 6 cases were slightly useful. 5) No side effects were observed except for elevation of GOT and LDH. These results suggest that CPZ might be useful drug against whooping cough.
