We have compared the 30S ribosomal proteins of strains of Escherichia coli sensitive to and dependent on streptomycin and identified a single protein that is functionally altered in the ribosomes dependent on streptomycin. This protein (30S-15) is the same protein that is functionally altered in ribosomes resistant to streptomycin.
