Recent reports of the prevalence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in Europe are infrequent compared with reports in the 1960s. Annual incidence of the isolation of MRSA was studied in a general hospital in Guipuzcoa (Basque country) over a 9-year period. Overall prevalence was 4.5%-12.93% in the first 3 years (coinciding with an epidemic phase) and later 0.29%, underlining the cyclic and epidemic nature of this infection.
