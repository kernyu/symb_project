In antibiotic therapy of children bacteriological findings should be considered. The choice of antibiotic doses depends on the drug pharmacokinetics and damaging effect, the state of the excretory organs and some other factors. Antibiotic elimination in children during the postnatal period is limited: there is a relationship between the gestation term and intensity of drug elimination. Antibiotics penetrate through the placental barrier. They are detected in the mother milk. The damaging effect of antibiotics in many respects depends on their properties, dosage and administration route. Children are more sensitive to the direct toxic action of antibiotics as compared to adults. Development of dysbacteriosis in children is frequent. Allergic reactions with diverse clinical signs are possible in children. Combined antibiotic therapy with observation of definite requirements is more efficient. Still, because of the antibiotic damaging effect monotherapy is more preferable in all possible cases.
