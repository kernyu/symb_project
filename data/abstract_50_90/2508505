Branhamella catarrhalis, a normal inhabitant of the human nasopharynx, is an opportunistic agent that usually infects patients with underlying diseases. B. catarrhalis has become increasingly recognized as an important respiratory pathogen. From november 1985 to february 1988 we have diagnosed four B. catarrhalis nosocomial pulmonary infections in the adult pulmonary intensive care unit (ICU) and eight in the pediatric ICU. The origin of the contamination has remained unproven because of the lack of a typing system for the strains. All isolates produced beta-lactamase.
