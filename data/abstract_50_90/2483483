Experiments on CBA and (CBA X C57BL)F1 mice have revealed that a prolonged period of antigen-nonspecific immunosuppression of humoral immunity develops in experimental staphylococcal infection; this period of suppression may be preceded by a short phase of antigen-nonspecific immunostimulation. Immunosuppression is linked with the accumulation of antigen-nonspecific T-suppressors in the spleen, these T-suppressors being capable of the manifestation of their activity both in vitro and in vivo in cases of their transplantation to semi-syngeneic recipients. Immunosuppression does not aggravate the course of staphylococcal infection and is accompanied by an increase in resistance to Pseudomonas aeruginosa superinfection, which is due to the stimulation of inflammatory reaction at the site of the injection of the superinfecting agent.
