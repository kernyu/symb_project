Bacteria responsible for nosocomial, i.e. hospital acquired, infections present a multiresistance to antibiotics. Multiple studies performed since the introduction of the first antibiotics have shown a correlation between their use and the identification and sensitivity of isolated bacteria. A program of control of antibiotherapy should be instituted in the hospitals in order to limit the occurrence of resistant strains.
