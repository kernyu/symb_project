Moxalactam (LY127935) exhibited greater in vitro activity than cefamandole and tobramycin against clinical isolates of Enterobacteriaceae, Aeromonas hydrophila, and Pseudomonas maltophilia. The activities of the three drugs against other microorganisms were as follows: for staphylococci, cefamandole = tobramycin greater than moxalactam; for streptococci, cefamandole greater than moxalactam greater than tobramycin; and for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, tobramycin greater than moxalactam greater than cefamandole. Moxalactam also demonstrated significant activity against the Bacteroides fragilis group and other anaerobes. Moxalactam was comparable to cefotaxime (HR756) in its inhibition of cephalothin-resistant and aminoglycoside-resistant clinical isolates.
