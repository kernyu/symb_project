In vitro assays showed that low concentrations (5--10 and 20 microgram/ml) of the antimicrobial paromomycin sulfate are able to block or diminish significantly the transfer of the tetracycline resistance R-factor between Escherichia coli and Salmonella pullorum. This observation is important because it offers the possibility of preventing the formation of tetracycline-resistant pathogens, a limiting factor of tetracycline use in both human and veterinary medicine.
