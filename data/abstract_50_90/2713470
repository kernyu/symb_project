Molecular processes of biological aging could interact with molecular effects of ethanol, potentiating each other and culminating in accelerated aging process. According to this premise effect of antioxidant of 3-hydroxypyridine class (3-HP) on behaviour of 3-month-old mice after chronic alcoholisation was investigated. 5-month alcoholisation induced impairment of the process of learning in mice and accelerated accumulation of lipofuscin (age pigment) in the brain. 3-HP consumption (20-25 mg/kg/day in drinking water) during alcoholisation contributed to preservation of learning ability in mice and decreased lipofuscin accumulation in the brain in comparison with alcohol-treated mice. Effect of 3-HP may be due to its antioxidant properties and its ability to increase animals resistance to the extreme factors.
