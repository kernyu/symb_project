Isolation of Campylobacter jejuni (C. jejuni) from experimental dogs and monkeys was undertaken. C. jejuni was detected from 14.7% of the fecal samples obtained from beagles in a production colony, whereas 32% of newly imported beagles harbored the organisms. C. jejuni was isolated from 25% of the young and 3.9% of adult dogs in an animal center. The organisms were isolated from newly imported cynomolgus and rhesus monkeys at high frequencies (49.2% and 38.8%, respectively). Almost all of the strains isolated were highly sensitive to erythromycin, chloramphenicol and gentamicin.
