Amifloxacin showed potent inhibitory activity against DNA gyrase of Escherichia coli. The difference in the susceptibilities of lipopolysaccharide-deficient Salmonella typhimurium mutants and their parent strain was less than twofold, and the difference in the susceptibilities of porin-deficient E. coli mutants and their parent strain was less than twofold. There was cross resistance among the quinolone group of agents; however, the decrease in MIC for norB mutants was slightly lower than that of other fluoroquinolones. Cell lysis was induced with combined treatment of amifloxacin and sodium dodecyl sulfate in E. coli. The frequency of mutants spontaneously resistant to amifloxacin was extremely low in all species tested.
