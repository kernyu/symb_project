1. Medium to large amount of CMZ (100-270 mg/kg/day) was administered to 4 cases of neonatal infants having severe infections due to pathogenic E. coli and sepsis due to E. coli CMZ was remarkably effective in all cases, and the causative bacteria disappeared in 100%. 2. Among 10 cases which administered CMZ, 5 cases showed side effect. Eruption, diarrhea and increase of GOT, GPT and LDH activities were observed but no case suggested interruption of administration. 3. Blood level of CMZ was determined in 4 cases of 0-1 day old, premature infants. The half life of CMZ was 8.55-15.3 hours, prolonged considerably, and 12 hours after one shot (20 mg/kg) of intravenous CMZ administration, 20.2 microgram/ml of blood level was maintained. 4. Intraspinal CMZ level was determined in aseptic meningitis. When one shot 50 mg/kg CMZ was given intravenously, intraspinal CMZ levels after 30 minutes and 1 hour were 20.3 microgram/ml and 34.5 microgram/ml, respectively, and distribution of CMZ in the cerebrospinal fluid was shown to be excellent. 5. Exchange blood infusion (amount of exchange, 170 ml/Kg) was performed in a small premature newborn baby, and blood transformation of CMZ was examined. It was found as the result that the blood level of CMZ was decreased to 53% of the pretreated level. 6. MIC of CMZ was examined in 3 strains of E. coli isolated from blood and cerebrospinal fluid. MICs were 0.39-0.78 microgram/ml when 10(6)/ml was inoculated and 0.78-1.56 when 10(8)/ml was inoculated.
