Vertebral osteomyelitis due to Staphylococcus aureus was suppressed by not cured by optimal therapy with nafcillin sodium; cure eventually was achieved by treatment with cefazolin sodium and gentamicin sulfate. This is vivo result correlated with in vitro observations that showed that the infecting organism was inhibited but not killed by prolonged incubation with nafcillin or cefazolin; killing was readily achieved in vitro by adding subinhibitory concentrations of gentamicin. Bacterial tolerance in this case appeared to be responsible for the failure of vertebral osteomyelitis to be cured by accepted therapy with beta-lactam antibiotics.
