Ribosomes from an erythromycin-producing strain, Streptomyces erythreus, lacked affinity for erythromycin and were also resistant to other macrolide antibiotics (leucomycin, spiramycin, and tylosin) and to lincomycin, whereas Streptomyces griseus B(3) ribosomes were susceptible to all of these antibiotics.
