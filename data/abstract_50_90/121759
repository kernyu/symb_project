Electron micrographs of cytological damage to log phase Pseudomonas aeruginosa caused by low consentrations of chlorhexidine indicate an action primarily on the cytoplasmic membrane at concentration of 2.0--3.0 micrograms/ml chlorhexidine, and on the cytoplasmic membrane plus layers external to it at concentrations greater than 3.0 micrograms/ml. Evidence of two types of resistance to chlorhexidine is presented.
