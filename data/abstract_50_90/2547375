Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-resistant variant of human mammary cancer MCF-7 cell line was isolated by stepwise selection. The final TNF-resistant variant Tnf-1000 showed more than 100-fold higher resistance than the parental MCF-7 cell. Saturation kinetics for 125I-TNF binding showed that TNF-1000 cells had similar TNF receptor numbers as MCF-7 cells, but of a lower affinity. Induction of superoxide dismutase (SOD) was compared between MCF-7 and Tnf-1000 cells treated with TNF: SOD scavenges potentially toxic superoxide radicals. TNF induced more mitochondrial manganese SOD (SODm) in MCF-7 than in Tnf-1000 whereas there appeared to be no significant induction of cytosolic copper/zinc SOD (SODc) by TNF in both MCF-7 and Tnf-1000 cell lines. Acquirement of TNF-resistance in MCF-7 cells might be correlated with expression of SODm.
