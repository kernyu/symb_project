The nisin resistance determinant and an origin of replication on pNP40, a plasmid of about 60 kilobases that is present in Streptococcus lactis subsp. diacetylactis DRC3, was cloned on a 7.6-kilobase EcoRI fragment. When self-ligated, this fragment existed as an independent replicon (pFM011) and contained a 2.6-kilobase EcoRI-XbaI fragment encoding nisin resistance.
