Two broad categories of combinations have been subject to experimental investigation against HSV-1 and HSV-2; those consisting of an active antiviral drug and an inhibitor of its catabolism and those which contain two active antiviral agents. The latter seek to exploit biochemical mechanisms likely to lead to a synergistic or complementary interaction. Examples of both types of combination for the suppression of resistance development and for the treatment of infection caused by resistant strains are discussed. Their possible relevance to the latent state is considered.
