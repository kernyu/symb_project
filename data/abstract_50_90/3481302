The in vitro susceptibility of Mycobacterium fortuitum, Mycobacterium chelonae and Mycobacterium avium to ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin and ofloxacin was studied by the agar dilution method. All strains of Mycobacterium fortuitum were inhibited by 2 mg/ml or less of these antimicrobial agents. Concentrations higher than achievable blood levels were necessary to inhibit Mycobacterium chelonae and Mycobacterium avium.
