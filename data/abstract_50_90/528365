9-beta-D-Arabinofuranosyladenine (ara-A) was produced by a new species of Streptomyces designated as S. herbaceus. Ara-A was found to have potent herbicidal activity against Echinochloa crus-galli, Digitaria adscendens and Chenopodium ficifolium by the treatment with ara-A before germination of these plants. However, Oryza sativa had strong resistance to ara-A.
