This study investigated fluctuations of cytosolic pH (pHi) of cultured rat vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) in reaction to metabolic alterations induced by angiotensin II (AII). Serially passed VSMCs from Wistar rat aortae were grown on coverslips and loaded with the pH-sensitive fluorescent indicator 2',7'-bis(carboxyethyl)-5,6-carboxyfluorescein. A biphasic reaction was seen after exposure of these cells to AII (1 nM to 1 microM); an initial and relatively brief phase of acidification was followed by sustained alkalinization. The rate of acidification and magnitude of alkalinization were dose-dependent. This biphasic effect of AII was also demonstrated in Ca2+-free medium and was mimicked by subjecting VSMCs to the calcium ionophore A23187 (5 microM) in Ca2+-containing medium but not in Ca2+-free medium. Verapamil (10 microM) almost entirely eliminated the AII-induced acidification, whereas amiloride analogues 5-(N-methyl-N-isobutyl)amiloride and 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl)amiloride (100 microM) as well as Na+-deficient medium abolished the subsequent (alkalinization) phase produced by the hormone. Activation of the Na+/H+ antiport by subjecting VSMCs to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (100 nM) prevented a subsequent effect of AII on the pHi profile. This resistance to a further action of the hormone was not mediated via cytoplasmic alkalinization. AII produced a dramatic redistribution in the cellular compartments of 45Ca2+ associated with accelerated 45Ca2+ washout. These findings suggest that the AII-induced acidification phase may relate to activation of the Ca2+ pump (Ca2+/H+ exchange) and that this process can take place in the presence and absence of extracellular Ca2+. The alkalinization phase is the consequence of stimulation of the Na+/H+ antiport, which in cultured VSMCs can be activated by a rise in cytosolic free Ca2+ as well as other mechanisms.
