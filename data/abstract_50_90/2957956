Susceptibilities to penicillin, cefotaxime, kanamycin, tetracycline, and spectinomycin were measured for 5 reference strains and 302 Neisseria gonorrhoeae isolates collected between 1980 and 1985. After an initial rise, the number of penicillinase-producing strains decreased. A gradual decrease in susceptibility to spectinomycin and the appearance of tetracycline-resistant strains were also documented.
