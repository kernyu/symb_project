Under certain culture conditions, Miracil (35 mug/ml) halts the growth of uninfected Escherichia coli. Cellular ribonucleic acid (RNA) synthesis is almost completely suppressed, whereas deoxyribonucleic acid and protein synthesis are inhibited to a lesser extent. When the drug is added to host bacteria prior to infection with bacteriophage MS2, the phage adsorb to the cells, but penetration of the viral RNA is inhibited. Penetration may be achieved without further viral development by infection in the presence of chloramphenicol. If the bacteria are infected with MS2 in the presence of chloramphenicol, subsequently washed to remove the chloramphenicol, and then treated with Miracil at any time between 0 and 20 min postinfection, a second viral function is inhibited and the yield of progeny phage is reduced. Addition of the drug after 20 min postinfection does not inhibit the infection process. When Miracil is present from early times in infection, only a limited synthesis of both double- and single-stranded virus-specific RNA is observed. The viral RNA species thus produced do not appear to differ from those made in the absence of the drug. A comparison of the activities of the viral RNA synthetase produced during the course of infection in the presence and in the absence of Miracil suggests that a possible cause of the inhibition is the synthesis of an unstable enzyme in the presence of the drug.
