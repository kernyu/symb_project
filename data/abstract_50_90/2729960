A total of 748 Salmonella strains (97 serovars) isolated from human (291), animal (119), environmental (141), food (102) and animal feed (95) sources were examined for resistance to 9 antimicrobial agents. Most of the human isolates were from hospitalized patients (282). An overall resistance rate of 98.8% was determined with 100% for human and environmental isolates. Resistance to sulfadiazine (87.7%) was most common, followed by streptomycin (61.2%), ampicillin (39%) and trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole (37.9%). Fifty one different resistance patterns were identified with Su (164 strains), Su-Sm (122) and Su-Sm-Tc-Cm-Km-Ap-Nx-Gm-Tm (95) predominating, the latter occurring only in human isolates. Multiple resistance was most frequently found among human isolates, particularly in S. derby and S. typhimurium strains. The relationship between antibiotic resistance, serovar and source of isolation of the Salmonella strains is discussed.
