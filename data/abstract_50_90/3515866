Insulin secretion was studied after stimulation with oral glucose and intravenous glucagon in 23 chronic alcoholics in a withdrawal state. Each subject was studied twice at one week's interval between the examinations. The insulin and C-peptide responses to glucagon were lower in the early withdrawal state. Moreover, the insulin and C-peptide increments were, when related to the magnitude of the glycemic stimulus, lower in the early than in the late withdrawal state. The fasting values of blood glucose, insulin and C-peptide and the blood glucose and C-peptide levels after oral glucose were higher in the early withdrawal state. These findings indicate that glucose metabolism in alcoholics in a withdrawal state can be disturbed by impaired insulin secretion and insulin resistance.
