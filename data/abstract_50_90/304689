As Ps. pyocyanea seems to replace previously dominant germs as the main cause of corneal infections, the influence of Chloromycetin and actinomycin D on the primary resistance of the cornea and the so-called depressor effect of corneal superinfection with Ps. pyocyanea was tested. The experimental results showed that primary resistance of the mouse cornea against Ps. pyocyanea could be reduced by local application of Chloromycetin drops, but not by actinomycin D. Likewise, the depressor effect of corneal superinfection by Ps. pyocyanea could be significantly reduced by Chloromycetin, whereas actinomycin D had no influence.
