The efficacy of chloroquine in the treatment of falciparum malaria was studied in two villages in Northeast Thailand, an area endemic for chloroquine-resistant falciparum infections. Chloroquine did not appear to reduce the duration or density of parasitemias experienced by asymptomatic villagers, but did benefit, usually temporarily, many subjects with symptomatic or high-density infections. These observations suggest that the high prevalence of chloroquine-resistant infections in the villages is similar to data from the hospital and clinics serving the area. The question whether chloroquine should remain available to this population should be evaluated.
