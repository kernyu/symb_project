A reporting system for the laboratory to communicate quantitative antimicrobic susceptibility test results to the physician in a manner that will optimize proper utilization of such test results is described. Minimal inhibitory concentrations are reported on a scale of clinically achievable concentrations, thus indicating the degree of susceptibility.
