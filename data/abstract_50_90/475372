One hundred recent clinical isolates of Campylobacter fetus subsp. jejuni were tested by an agar dilution technique for susceptibility to each of 20 antimicrobial agents. Doxycycline and gentamicin were the most active of the drugs examined, inhibiting all strains at concentrations achievable in serum. Although the median minimal inhibitory concentration of erythromycin was low, 8% of the isolates were highly resistant. All isolates of Campylobacter fetus subsp. jejuni were relatively resistant to the beta-lactam antibiotics. Some strains were highly resistant to metronidazole and tinidazole.
