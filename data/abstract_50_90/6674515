Numbers of the strains of each bacterial species isolated from urinary tract infections were summed and their incidences were calculated for each a half year from the second half of 1980 to the first half of 1982. The incidences of Escherichia coli strains were found to be greatly reduced and those of Streptococcus faecalis strains were greatly increased. Those of Staphylococcus epidermidis strains were also increased. This trend was thought to be caused by the extensive and exclusive use of cephalosporin derivatives. Minimal inhibitory concentrations of gentamicin (GM), amikacin (AMK), ampicillin (ABPC), cefazolin (CEZ), ceftizoxime (CZX), latamoxef (LMOX) and minocycline (MINO) against these isolated strains were estimated. The most sensitive drugs for E. coli were found to be CZX, LMOX, GM and AMK, CZX and MINO for Klebsiella, CZX and LMOX for Proteus, and GM for Pseudomonas aeruginosa. All Gram-positive cocci were found generally to be most susceptible to MINO, but S. faecalis and other Pseudomonas were also sensitive to ABPC. Exclusive use of cephalosporins for the treatment may induce selective increases of the resistant species in normal flora. Since these flora could be the causative agents for various infections, these selections caused by the exclusive use of the monotype drugs are not preferable, and various different drugs should be used for the suitable cases.
