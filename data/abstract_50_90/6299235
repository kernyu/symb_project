The antiviral action of a new drug, 5-amino-2-(dimethylaminoethyl)-benzo-[de]-isoquinolin-1.3-dione has been studied against herpes simplex type 2 (HSV-2) and adenovirus type 5 (Ad-5) grown in Vero cells. The concentration of the drug which gives a 5 log10 reduction in virus titer was 4 micrograms/ml (maximum tolerated concentration) for HSV-2. The anti-HSV-2 activity of this compound was one log. more powerful than that of iododeoxyuridine (IDU). At this concentration the drug shows virucidal activity against HSV-2. No inhibition was found when the drug was tested against Ad-5. The inhibition of virus production has been studied depending upon the amount of drug or virus, and drug addition-time after infection. Reversibility of inhibition after drug removal, and drug resistance in the presence of the drug have also been determined.
