The in vitro study of the possible formation of L-forms of Brucella under the effect of tetracycline, streptomycin, rifampicin or their combinations with penicillin showed that passages of various Brucella species on media containing increasing concentrations of the antibiotics resulted in insignificant morphological changes in the cells. Passages of the same cultures on media containing combinations of the above antibiotics with penicillin resulted in more significant changes in the cell morphology, up to formation of spheroplasts. No L-transformation was observed under the experimental conditions.
