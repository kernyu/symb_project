The authors studied the susceptibility to 5 aminoglycosides (amikacin, dibekacin, gentamicin, netilmicin and tobramycin) of 3,354 strains isolated at the Centre Hospitalier Sud in Bordeaux during 1987. The results are compared to those obtained in 1984 on 2,818 strains. Amikacin remains the most active aminoside against the Enterobacteriaceae and Acinetobacter; against Pseudomonas, tobramycin has become the best one at that time, as well as netilmicin against Staphylococcus aureus. Evolution: no significative increase of Enterobacteriaceae resistance to aminoglycosides was observed during the last 3 years except for Providencia and Serratia. For Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas, percentage of resistant strains is respectively two-fold and three-fold higher. Although resistance increased in that species, netilmicin and amikacin showed a still good activity against Staphylococcus aureus.
