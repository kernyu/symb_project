Studies on infections in a hospital for diseases of the skin are described. Patients were shown to acquire staphylococci in the groin and on the chest at about the same rate as in the nose. In contrast to surgical wards, many staphylococci were resistant to tetracycline but sensitive to penicillin. Nevertheless, much of the epidemic spread of staphylococci was with typical surgical-ward strains rather than with phage group II strains which might be thought typical of skin diseases.
