Twenty broiler chickens were fed 80 g/T salinomycin, an antibiotic produced by Streptomyces albus, and 20 birds were fed a control, unmedicated feed. The birds were experimentally infected with Salmonella typhimurium. The study evaluated the effects of salinomycin on Salmonella incidence, shedding, and antimicrobial resistance. Salinomycin had no effect on body weights, length of time salmonellae were shed, number of salmonellae shed on postdosing day 3, salmonellae tissue recoverability, or on the total number of resistance patterns. Salinomycin caused the decline of salmonellae to be more gradual; however, both treatments were comparable at the end of the study. The majority of isolated from birds receiving salinomycin maintained the original S. typhimurium antibiogram of streptomycin, sulfadiazine, and nalidixic acid. The salinomycin salmonellae were more susceptible to tetracycline, amikacin, carbenicillin, gentamicin, and cephalothin. The multiple resistance patterns of eight and nine drugs tended to be more prevalent among salmonellae from control birds than salinomycin treated birds. The antibiotic salinomycin appears to be an acceptable feed additive in broilers at the level of 80 g/T based on these results of its effects on salmonellae shedding and antimicrobial resistance.
