Nine pediatric patients with drug-induced toxic epidermal necrolysis were treated with a regimen of basic burn care and without the use of steroids or topical or systemic antimicrobial agents. Although septic complications continue to occur frequently, infections are better tolerated when potential iatrogenic sources of decreased host resistance, such as steroids, are eliminated. Neutropenia, gram-negative sepsis, and mortality were all greatly reduced with this regimen, while healing was neither impaired nor prolonged. Thus, steroids and sulfa-containing topical agents should be avoided in the treatment of this disorder.
