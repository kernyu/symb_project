Four ampicillin-resistant, beta-lactamase-producing strains of Haempohilus influenzae type b were examined for the presence of plasmid deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). Three resistant strains contained a 30 x 10-6-dalton (30Mdal) plasmid and one resitant strain contained a 3-Mdal plasmid. The ampicillin-sensitive Haemophilus strains examined did not contain plasmid DNA. Transformation of a sensitive H. influenzae strain to ampicillin resistance with isolated plasmid DNA preparations revealed that the structural gene for beta-lactamase resided on both plasmid species. DNA-DNA hybridization studies showed that the 30-Mdal Haemophilus plasmid contained the ampicillin translocation DNA segment (TnA) found on some R-factors of enteric origin of the H. influenzae plasmids.
