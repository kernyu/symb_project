The influence of adaptation to moderate hypoxia on anticonvulsive resistance of low tolerant rats has been investigated. Focal epilepsy was induced by penicillin application to sensorimotor cortex of the rat brain. Adaptation to hypoxia has been shown to increase the resistance of rats to epileptogenic penicillin effect which is manifested in the prolongation of the latent period of epileptiform discharges and less frequent epileptic fits. The mechanisms of the resistance increase remains to be investigated.
