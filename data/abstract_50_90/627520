An inhibitor of dopamine-beta-hydroxylase, designated A32390A, was isolated from the culture broth of a Pyrenochaeta species. The inhibitor showed antimicrobial activity against fungi and gram-positive bacteria. Spectroscopic analysis and chemical degradation studies indicated that the structure was 1,6-di-O-(2-isocyano-3-methylcrotonyl)-D-mannitol.
