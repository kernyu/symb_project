On the basis of a clinical study an analysis about 86 patients with obstructing bilateral nephrolithiasis and chronic obstructive infection of the urinary tract is elaborated. In order to illustrate the change of resistance of the causative agents during a period of 10 years (1973-1982) two separated 5-year analyses are compared. It is made evident that the relations of sensitivity to seven chemotherapeutic drugs in Coli, Proteus and Pseudomonas infections have changed in favour of increasing resistances of causative agents. The results obtained are an expression of the unstableness of antibiotic therapies under palliative purpose when urological basic diseases are not removed. From the analysis the demand for changing the general problems of obstructive pyelonephritis without possible operative sanation becomes evident. early diagnosis and treatment of predisposing factors are the two keystones of our efforts, when the chronic obstructive infection of the urinary tract by resistant causative agents shall not remain a therapeutic problem in the same measure as hitherto.
