A bacteriophage-typing scheme for the differentiation and classification of clinically isolated strains of Serratia marcescens was developed. Thirty-four Serratia bacteriophages were isolated from sewage and used to type 185 of 204 isolates (90.6%) of S. marcescens into 23 bacteriophage groups representing 71 types. Different bacteriophage types occurred at different intervals, suggesting that particular strains of S. marcescens are found at certain times. A correlation was found between inositol fermentation and bacteriophage type and between susceptibility to carbenicillin and bacteriophage type. However, there was no relationship between source of isolate and bacteriophage type. Bacteriophage typing of S. marcescens should provide a system which will aid in determining the origin of nosocomial Serratia infections.
