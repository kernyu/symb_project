Sensitivity to levomycetin, streptomycin, chlortetracycline, oxytetracycline, monomycin, neomycin and erythromycin of 3766 strains of Shigella isolated from dysentery patients within 1966-1973 was determined with the method of standard discs. The strains proved to be resistant to tetracycline (94.3-99.4 per cent), streptomycin (85.1-94.9 per cent) and levomycetin (69-93.1 percent). By present the dysentery bacilli have preserved their sensitivity to monomycin (88.2 per cent) and neomycin (98.2 per cent). Cultures insensitive or slightly sensitive to erythromycin predominated. Strains with multiple resistance amounted to 79 per cent, including 82.5 per cent of Shigella Sonne, 51.8 per cent of Shigella Flexneri and 35.9 percent of Newcastle bacteria.
