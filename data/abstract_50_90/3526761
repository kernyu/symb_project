Bacteriological studies of 500 vaginal swabs from pregnant women in second and third trimester from 4 government hospitals in Ibadan showed that 8 (1.6 per cent) were found to be culture-positive for Group B Streptococcus. Five (1.0 per cent) were found to harbour group D streptococci. All the 8 group B Streptococcus isolates were sensitive to erythromycin, methicillin, penicillin G, ampicillin and chloramphenicol in decreasing order. They were resistant to tetracycline, sulphafurazole and streptomycin.
