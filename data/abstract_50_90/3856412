A new antibacterial substance, ofloxacin (DL8280), was used in the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis. The agent was given to 19 patients with chronic cavitary lung tuberculosis as single doses of 300 mg daily for 6 to 8 months. A decrease in the amount of tubercle bacilli in the sputum was observed in almost all patients, and negative conversion occurred in 5. Resistance of tubercle bacilli to the agent appeared in patients who did not show negative conversion. No side effects were observed during the administration period. The agent was considered useful in lung tuberculosis therapy.
