The bactericidal effect of a combination of rifampin (Ramp) and trimethoprim (Tmp) was studied using dense cultures of test organisms, including some urinary pathogens, growing in human urine. Drug concentrations used were similar to those attainable in human urine. The combination was more effective than the individual drugs and than a combination of Tmp plus sulfamethoxazole (Smx). Tmp was bactericidal in urine and blocked the emergence of Ramp-resistant bacteria. Ramp was responsible for most of the bactericidal action of the combination but also potentiated the bactericidal activity of Tmp. Ramp suppressed the selection of thy- (Tmp-resistant) bacteria. Under the experimental conditions, Smx+Tmp was not more bactericidal than Tmp alone for most of the test organisms, despite strong synergy between the two at subinhibitory concentrations.
