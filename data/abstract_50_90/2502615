Mupirocin is a new, topical antibiotic effective for the treatment of impetigo. It has a unique structure, mechanism of action, and water-miscible formulation. When it is applied to an infected area three times daily, clinical improvement should be seen in 85% to 100% of patients within 3 to 5 days. It is associated with a low incidence of adverse effects and cross-resistance. Further studies are necessary to define the exact role of mupirocin in treating other primary and secondary cutaneous infections.
