A strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (3-Post) was resistant to cefsulodin and ceftazidime at 37 degrees C but sensitive at 20 degrees C. Resistance was mediated by chromosomally-encoded beta lactamase which was synthesised at a high level during growth above 30 degrees C but at a low, inducible level during growth below 27 degrees C.
