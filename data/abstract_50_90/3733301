Macrophages which play an important role in host resistance against infections are considered to be a target for various immunomodulators. In order to examine the effects of selected immunomodulators on macrophage function, the effects of N-(2-mercapto-2-methylpropanoyl)-L-cysteine (SA96), levamisole (LMS) and D-penicillamine (D-Pc) on the candidacidal activity of the normal peritoneal cells (PC) were investigated. In the in vitro studies, SA96 increased the candidacidal activity of PC 4-fold, while D-Pc and LMS treatments did not increase this activity. In the ex vivo studies, PC obtained from the mice pre-treated with SA96, D-Pc and LMS showed a high candidacidal activity. Elevated candidacidal activity was not due to changes of cell types of PC populations. These results suggest that D-Pc and LMS activate the function of macrophage in vivo and SA96 activates the function both in vitro and in vivo.
