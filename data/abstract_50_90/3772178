Colony growth in soft agar was used to identify human tumors that were sensitive to the direct antiproliferative effects of mismatched dsRNA (Ampligen). The results suggest that different human solid malignancies vary significantly in their sensitivity to Ampligen. Tumors with 50% or more of their surgical specimens showing sensitivity included carcinoid, glioblastoma, and carcinomas of the kidney, and lung. Resistant tumors (less than 15% sensitivity) included sarcomas and colo-rectal carcinomas. Overall, 42% of the tumor specimens studied showed a 50% or greater reduction in tumor cell colony formation after a single initial treatment with Ampligen (250 micrograms/ml). Interestingly, one patient's tumor which was de novo sensitive to interferon (IFN), but emerged as IFN-resistant following IFN therapy, remained sensitive to Ampligen. Thus, a clonogenic assay may prove useful in identifying human tumors and individuals for clinical trials with Ampligen, including patients resistant to IFN.
