A study was carried out to investigate the sensitivity of 326 salmonella strains with regard to the antibiotics: penicillin, oxacillin, ampicillin, carbenicillin, tetracycline, streptomycin, kanamycin, gentamicin, erythromycin and chloramphenicol and furazolidone. A tendency towards an increase of the salmonella strains resistant to tetracycline was observed. Such a tendency was not found with chloramphenicol, streptomycin, kanamycin, gentamicin, carbenicillin and furazolidone. An idea is endorsed, namely, that an increased use of large-spectre antibiotics for prophylaxis ends and treatment in poultry-raising has not brought about the development of a sufficient medicinal resistance with salmonellas. Medicinal preparations are recommended for keeping down the salmonelloses with poultry--namely, a mixture of chloramphenicol and furazolidone. It is pointed out that on the basis of these studies a good effect is to be expected also of the implementation of gentamicin, kanamycin and carbenicillin.
