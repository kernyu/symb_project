An improved selective medium, Tryptose-sulfite-cycloserine (TSC) agar, for the enumeration of Clostridium perfringens is described. It consists of the same basal medium as Shahidi-Ferguson-perfringens (SFP) agar, but with 400 mug of D-cycloserine per ml substituted for the kanamycin and polymyxin. Tolerance of C. perfringens for D-cycloserine, its production of lecithinase, and its ability to reduce sulfite were used as the basis for development of this medium. Comparisons were made between TSC and SFP agars for the recovery of vegetative cells of C. perfringens by using statistical methods. The results showed that TSC allowed virtually complete recovery of most of the C. perfringens strains while inhibiting practically all facultative anaerobes tested. SFP agar allowed a slightly higher rate of recovery of C. perfringens but was found to be much less selective.
