Pores formed in the membranes of animal cells by complexes of sterols and the polyene antibiotic amphotericin B can efficiently kill the cells. Thus, in the absence of exogenous sources of cholesterol, inhibitors of enzymes in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway render cells resistant to amphotericin B. Preincubation of Chinese hamster ovary cells with compactin or 25-hydroxycholesterol, inhibitors of the synthesis of the key intermediate mevalonate, protected cells from amphotericin B killing and this protection was reversed by the addition of exogenous mevalonate. The ability of compactin to confer amphotericin B resistance on normal cells was abolished when cells were provided exogenous cholesterol by the receptor-mediated endocytosis of low density lipoprotein. Low density lipoprotein receptor-defective Chinese hamster ovary cells were not subject to this low density lipoprotein-dependent amphotericin B killing. Exogenous mevalonate did not prevent 4,4,10 beta-trimethyl-trans-decal-3 beta-ol, an inhibitor of mevalonate conversion to sterols, from protecting cells from amphotericin B. A simple two-step protocol in which cells are preincubated (15-24 h) with potential inhibitors and then treated (3-6 h) with amphotericin B was devised to provide a sensitive method for detecting direct (e.g., competitive) and regulatory inhibitors of cholesterol biosynthesis. This protocol may prove useful in detecting potential antihypercholesterolemia drugs and is currently being used to isolate mutants in receptor-mediated endocytosis.
