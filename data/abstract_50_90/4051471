Antimicrobial activity of sisomicin against causative agents of wound infections was studied. It was shown that by its antimicrobial activity and the rate of bactericidal effect attainment sisomicin is superior to other aminoglycosides, such as gentamicin and tobramycin. Individual variability of the pharmacokinetics of sisomicin on its intravenous and intramuscular injection to patients with wound infections was observed. For prediction of the treatment efficacy it is suggested that the drug be used under the control of its blood levels in comparison to the MTC for the isolated causative agent.
