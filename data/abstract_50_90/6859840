The isolation of trimethoprim-resistant, sulfonamide-susceptible Enterobacteriaceae causing urinary tract infections is reported. The appearance of these strains followed the introduction of trimethoprim alone for use as treatment. Trimethoprim resistance was attributable to plasmids or transposons less frequently in sulfonamide-susceptible Escherichia coli isolates than in sulfonamide-resistant strains.
