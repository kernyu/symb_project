16 patients admitted to a MICU were treated with timentin (ticarcillin + clavulanic acid) for bacterial infections: 11 cases of pulmonary infection, 3 cases of urinary tract infection, 2 septic shocks, 3 septicemias and 1 case of multifocal infection. The pathogens considered as a firmly established cause of infection were: 5 Acinetobacter, 12 Pseudomonas, 3 Serratia, 4 Klebsiella, 1 E. coli, 2 Proteus, 1 Providencia, 1 Staphylococcus aureus, 1 Staphylococcus epidermidis, 1 Streptococcus D and 1 Flavobacterium meningosepticum. The susceptibility of these pathogens to ticarcillin and timentin is reported. Timentin was prescribed alone in 9 cases and associated (with an aminoglycoside) in 7, in a daily dose of 9 to 18 g, for 6 to 45 days. 3 patients died. The value of timentin in infections due to multiresistant MICU pathogens is stressed.
