The aerobic and anaerobic cervical microflora was determined before operation and on day 4 after operation in groups of women undergoing a clinical trial of prophylaxis with three doses of cefoxitin, cefazolin, or placebo for infectious complications of nonelective cesarean section. Floral shifts occurred post partum, with return of Escherichia coli and Bacteroides fragilis and a decrease in Candida colonization. No significant differences in flora existed preoperatively among patients receiving cefoxitin, cefazolin, or placebo, but by day 4, both antibiotic groups had greater enterococcal colonization. This difference was more marked with cefoxitin than with cefazolin. No difference in E. coli or B. fragilis colonization was noted by day 4 in placebo and antibiotic groups. Resistance developing in isolates in the antibiotic groups was mainly a result of enterococcal colonization. Results of this study indicate that a three-dose cephalosporin prophylactic regimen resulted in a significant selection of resistant enterococcal colonization but there was no increase in nosocomial infection in the antibiotic groups compared to the placebo group. There did not appear to be significant differences in either species selection or antibiotic resistance of aerobic or anerobic microflora between the cefoxitin and cefazolin groups.
