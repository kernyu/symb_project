10 adult patients (age 27-62 years) with refractory or relapsed acute nonlymphocytic leukemia were treated with high dose cytosine arabinoside (HDAraC: 3 g/m2 q 12 h by IV infusion, d 1-6) either alone (7 patients) or with additional treatment, consisting of bone marrow transplantation (1 patient), m-AMSA (1pt.) and VP16 (1 patient). All patients had received conventional dose AraC (CDAraC); 8 patients were resistant to CDAraC, having failed 1 or more courses of CDAraC just before treatment with HDAraC. Recovery of granulocyte count (0,5 X 10(9)L) occurred at a median of 26 d (23-27 d) after initial therapy, and recovery of platelet counts (50 X 10(9)/L) at a median of 24 d (22-27 d). 6 patients became severely septic, 3 of them requiring granulocyte transfusions. Consequently, sophisticated blood banking facilities and supportive care are required. The non-myeloid toxicities associated with HDAraC were not severe. Vomiting (9/10), erythematous skin rash (4/10), conjunctivitis and photophobia (2/10) were found most commonly. CNS-toxicity, pulmonary toxicity or drug fever were not observed. 4 patients achieved a complete remission and 1 a partial remission. 2 patients failed to respond and 3 patients died during the period of pancytopenia. Thus, HDAraC is effective treatment for refractory or relapsed ANLL, even in cases of apparent resistance to CDAraC.
