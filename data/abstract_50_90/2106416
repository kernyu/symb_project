Quinolone-resistant clones were selected from clinical Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii and Serratia marcescens isolates in a frequency ranging from 10(-8) to 10(-6). The outer membrane proteins of quinolone-resistant E. coli clones remained unaltered, as was the case for 10 of 11 C. freundii and 4 of 11 S. marcescens clones ('nal B' type). There was no strong relation between alterations of outer membrane proteins and cross-resistance with chemically unrelated compounds such as tetracycline or chloramphenicol; however, tetracycline resistance was observed in some C. freundii clones with unaltered outer membrane proteins ('mar A'). Most of the quinolone-resistant S. marcescens clones can be considered 'nor B' or 'nor C' mutants due to their cross-resistance with other compounds, their altered outer membrane proteins and changes of lipopolysaccharide. In a few cases, subinhibitory quinolone concentrations caused alterations of outer membrane proteins in S. marcescens during mid log phase without development of resistance.
