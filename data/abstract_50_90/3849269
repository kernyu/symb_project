Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has become endemic in Detroit, accounting for 50% of bacteremias in heroin abusers. To identify the salient epidemiologic and clinical features of MRSA bacteremia, case-control studies were performed comparing 28 cases of MRSA bacteremia to 28 cases of methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA) bacteremia in intravenous drug abusers. Infective endocarditis was diagnosed in 46.4% (13 of 28). In endocarditis and nonendocarditis bacteremia alike, the duration of fever, length of hospitalization, need for surgery, and mortality rates were similar. A history of recent antimicrobial therapy, especially cephalosporins, was more common in the MRSA group (p = 0.006). Complications including neurologic, renal, vascular, and musculoskeletal manifestations were more common in the MSSA endocarditis patients than MRSA endocarditis patients, although this difference was not significant. Complications related to antibiotic therapy were similar for both groups. The case-control studies indicate that MRSA and MSSA are similar in their virulence as measured by duration of hospitalization, duration of fever, complications, and mortality.
