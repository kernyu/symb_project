A species of Aspergillus was isolated from vomitus and scrapings of the tongue of a patient with a form of respiratory illness. The fungus has since been identified as Aspergillus aculeatus, Iizuka. The fungus grew over a wide range of temperatures, the spores appeared to be thermophilic. Many local foodstuffs supported the growth of the fungus in culture. Ultraviolet light inhibited mycelia growth and sporulation of A. aculeatus. The fungicides brestan, benlate, fundazole and kocide 101 inhibited the growth of the fungus more than daconil, demosen and dithane M-45. Amphotericin B and sulfadiazine completely arrested the growth of the fungus while sulfamycin, nalidixic acid and kanamycin had no detectable effects.
