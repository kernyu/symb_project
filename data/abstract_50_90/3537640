The uptake of nystatin by sensitive and by resistant cells of Saccharomyces cerevisiae was studied as a function of nystatin concentration, temperature and pH. The presence or absence of glucose in nystatin uptake experiments was also studied. The rate data, effects of glucose and the derived activation energies for nystatin uptake revealed significant differences in response between sensitive and resistant cells. The role of the cell wall in the uptake process is discussed.
