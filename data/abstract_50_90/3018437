Two regions tentatively called unsA and unsR were identified on pSC101. One, unsA, corresponds to less than 650 bp of the N-terminal in the tetracycline resistance structural gene and seems to inhibit stable maintenance of pSC101. The other, unsR, is defined within the 1 kb XhoI-EcoRI region located upstream of the tetracycline resistance structural gene and is a regulatory gene clearly distinct from tetR (Unger et al. 1984); it serves as a suppressor of the unsA function.
