The results of determinations of sensitivities of bacterial strains to various antibiotics are summarized as follows: 1. Against Escherichia coli, ofloxacin (OFLX) showed the strongest activity among oral antibacterial and antibiotic agents. Its MIC90 was below 0.10 micrograms/ml. The next strongest activity was found in mecillinam (MPC), cefaclor (CCL) and pipemidic acid (PPA); MIC90's of these agents 3.13 micrograms/ml. Cefotiam (CTM), cefotaxime (CTX), ceftizoxime (CZX), cefmenoxime (CMX) and latamoxef (LMOX) had MIC90 below 0.39 micrograms/ml. MIC90's of cefmetazole (CMZ) and cefoperazone (CPZ) were 1.56 micrograms/ml. Aztreonam (AZT) and carumonam (CRMN) in the monobactam group showed strong activities with MIC90's at 0.20 micrograms/ml. 2. Although Klebsiella pneumoniae had a strong resistance to ampicillin (ABPC) and showed relatively low sensitivities to other oral antibacterial and antibiotic agents, OFLX maintained high activity against this species and showed MIC90 of 0.39 micrograms/ml. Among injectable antibiotics, third generation cephems showed the strongest activity to this species with MIC90 of CZX below 0.10 micrograms/ml, of CTX and CMX 0.20 micrograms/ml, and of LMOX 0.78 micrograms/ml. MIC90 of CPZ was 6.25 micrograms/ml, which was the same as those of cefazolin (CEZ) and cefoxitin (CFX). CTM had similar MIC90 to LMOX, namely, 1.56 micrograms/ml. MIC90 of CMZ was 3.13 micrograms/ml. Monobactams AZT and CRMN showed strong activities to this species; their MIC90's were below 0.10 micrograms/ml and 0.20 micrograms/ml. 3. Although Citrobacter freundii generally exhibited low sensitivities to antibacterial and antibiotic agents examined, it showed high sensitivity to OFLX, at MIC80 of 0.78 micrograms/ml. This species showed low sensitivities to MPC, nalidixic acid (NA), PPA, and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (ST). Among injectable antibiotics, LMOX and CMX had activities against this species; namely, MIC80's were 6.25 and 3.13 micrograms/ml, respectively. Among monobactams, AZT showed MIC80 of 12.5 micrograms/ml, and CRMN had that of 6.25 micrograms/ml. 4. Against Enterobacter cloacae, the strongest antibacterial activity was found with OFLX which had MIC90 of 0.39 micrograms/ml. A relatively strong activity was seen with MPC. MIC80 of MPC was 1.56 micrograms/ml. Except to CTM, this species had poor sensitivities to injectable first and second generation cephems, and their MIC80's were over 200 micrograms/ml. MIC80 of CTM was 25 micrograms/ml.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
