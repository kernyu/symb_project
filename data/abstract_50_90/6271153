The Authors have studied the ability of producing enzymes blocking various antibiotics by 274 Gram-negative germs isolated in the years 1978-80 in the Province of Chieti (Italy). The results have showed that a high percentage of examined strains presents a polyresistance towards penicillins, cephalosporins, chloramphenicol and amino-glucosides producing in the same time beta-lactamase, acetyl-transferases and phospho-transferases.
