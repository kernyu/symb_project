A case of glossitis calcinosa in a dog caused by Pasteurella multocida is reported. Swelling of the tongue and reduced appetite were the predominant clinical symptoms. Due to latent infections with P. multocida in many species there is a risk of bitewounds being infected with this microorganism. In order to find the carrier-rate of P. multocida samples in canines, teeth and gingiva of 121 dogs and 30 cats were examined bacteriologically, revealing a carrier rates of 55% and 80% respectively. The rate is significantly higher in dogs with poor oral hygiene (calcula), and there is a tendency towards small dogs being more at risk than large dogs and male cats more than females. The isolated strains of P. multocida were most sensitive to chloramphenicol and tetracycline whereas, many were resistent to penicillin and sulfa. The theory, that this pattern should be explained by the common use of the latter drugs in veterinary practice, is not valid under Danish conditions, where chloramphenicol and tetracycline are commonly used in the small animal clinic. Accordingly suspected P. multocida infections should be treated with chloramphenicol or tetracycline, until the result of a sensitivity test is available, and not with penicillin which today is the general routine.
