A total of 1316 strains of Salmonella belonging to 20 serotypes isolated at P.G.I. Chandigarh (India) were tested for drug resistance. Drug resistance was noticed in 494 (38.3%) of the strains; 194 (14.8%) of these strains were resistant to one drug, while 300 (23.5%) had multiple drug resistance. All isolated strains were sensitive to gentamicin, furazolidone and nalidixic acid. Resistance to streptomycin was observed in 233 (17.7%), chloramphenicol 197 (14,9%), tetracycline 293 (22.3%), ampicillin 428 (32.5%), kanamycin 206 (15.7%), neomycin 206 (15.7%) and sulphadiazine 215 (19.9%). Multiple drug resistance was most common in S. bareilly, S. typhimurium and S. anatum serotypes. Increase in incidence of drug resistance in Salmonellae has been noticed during 1972-1978.
