Sensitivity of 788 strains of Erwinia isolated from natural substrates and received from other laboratories was studied with respect to penicillin, streptomycin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol and kanamycin. It was found that 346 (43.9 per cent) strains were drug resistant. However, the levels of the resistance to most of the drugs tested were not high and amounted to 5-10 gamma/ml. Penicillin resistance was the most frequent characteristics of the strains studied (341 strains). The resistance levels to this drug were higher than those to the other drugs and ranged from 25 to 100 gamma/ml. In some cases they were higher. Analysis of the drug resistance spectra showed that Erwinia strains resistant to 1 (172 strains) or 2 (149 strains) antibiotics were most frequent. 25 strains were multiresistant (to 3-5 drugs). All the resistant strains had 18 types of drug resistance. The genetic control of the drug resistance feature was carried out in the experiments on crossing of the drug resistant strains of Erwinia with the sensitive bacteria of the same genera, i.e. Erwinia chrysanthemi EP-3 and E. coli K-12. The results of the experiments were negative, which should be considered as an evidence of chromosomal localization of the antibiotic resistant genes in the Erwinia bacteria studied.
