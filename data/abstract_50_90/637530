A total of 4664 bacteriological analyses of the wound and purulent discharge from orthopedo-traumatological patients were performed within a 6-year period, i.e. from 1971 to 1976. Staphylococci were the dominating microbes of the purulent-inflammatory foci. Its part in the monoculture amounted to 64.5--82 per cent. The specific weight of the monocultures of various microbes decreased during the last 3 years, while the number of the microbial associations increased from 11.6 to 25.4 per cent Staph. aureus predominated in the inflammatory processes (65.8 to 86.5 per cent). Still, during the last 3 years the number of Staph. epidermidis increased from 16.8 to 26.2 per cent. The number of the so called "intermediate" or dissociated type of Staphylococcus, i.e. Staph. albus usually amounted to 7.5--8.1 per cent. In 1976 its number was 12.5 per cent. The pathogenic microbes of the coccal group were usually sensitive to erythromycin, monomycin, levomycetin and kanamycin. Among these microbes only staphylococci preserved their sensitivity to penicillin. The causative agents of purulent processes, i.e. Escherichia, Proteus, Pseudomonas were resistant to most of the antibiotics. Sensitivity to monomycin was preserved by 50 per cent only in Proteus. The microbial associations were mainly sensitive to monomycin and kanamycin.
