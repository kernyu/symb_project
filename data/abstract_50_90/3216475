Antibacterial activity of gentamicin (GM), along with activities of other aminoglycosides and beta-lactams, was studied against clinical isolates collected from pediatric patients during a period of May 1986-April 1987. 1. GM-resistance was noted in 22% of Staphylococcus aureus, 6% of Proteus vulgaris, 8% of Morganella morganii, 40% of Providencia spp., 6% of Enterobacter spp., 14% of Serratia marcescens, and 14% of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates. No GM-resistance was observed with isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis. 2. The antibacterial activity of GM against clinical isolates from pediatric patients was found to be comparable to its activity against clinical isolates from adults studied at the same time. 3. The majority of GM-resistant strains of S. aureus were MCRSA, and the GM-resistant strains of S. marcescens and P. aeruginosa were found also to be resistant to multiple drugs. 4. GM-resistant strains were found at relatively high rates (14-22%) in S. aureus, S. marcescens and P. aeruginosa. These rates did not increase compared to the rates observed in the first half of the 1980's. 5. GM was considered to have poor antibacterial activity against genus Providencia. It is concluded from above results that GM still maintains effective antibacterial activity against many of causative organisms of infections in both adults and children.
