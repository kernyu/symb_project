Using a set of overlapping deletion mutants in the tetracycline-resistance transposon Tn10, it has been established that certain regions of the Tn10 genome exert a powerful inhibition on translocation of an intact Tn10 element into the bacterial genome. Such inhibition is strongly temperature dependent: at 37 degrees C translocation is inhibited by at least a factor of 100; no inhibition of translocation is detected at 30 degrees C.
