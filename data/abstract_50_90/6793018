50 children with bone and joint infections (acute osteomyelitis, suppurative acute arthritis, osteoarthritis) were treated with pristinamycin. The responsible bacterium was most often but not exclusively Staphylococcus aureus; its sensitivity to various antibiotics is discussed. The value of biochemical tests for diagnosis and follow-up is emphasized; the potency of this drug avoids the need for intravenous therapy. A therapeutic protocol according to age, type of and sensitivity of the germs is proposed.
