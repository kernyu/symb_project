Two derivatives of 3-mercaptopropylene sulphide (B.R.L. 482), 3-acetylthiopropylene sulphide (B.R.L. 459) and 3-(2-furoylthio)propylene sulphide (B.R.L. 658), have been tested in mice for antitubercular activity. The compounds were administered daily in arachis oil by the subcutaneous route. When tested by a prolongation in survival time B.R.L. 459 was less active than streptomycin, while B.R.L. 658 was of the same order of activity. When assessed by the lesions present in the lungs after 14 days' treatment B.R.L. 658 was as active as isoniazid and B.R.L. 459 was of the same order of activity as streptomycin. Neither compound, however, cured an established infection and resistance developed rapidly to both compounds, both in vitro and in vivo. It is concluded that, in view of their adverse physical and pharmacological properties, the compounds are unsuitable for clinical use.
