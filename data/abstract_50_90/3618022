The species composition of gram-negative opportunistic bacteria isolated from different objects at three puerperal wards of a maternity clinic was studied. Escherichia coli and Acinetobacter were found to have a fairly wide circulation. The objects most contaminated by these bacteria were determined. The study showed that up to 33.3% of the isolated hospital strains of gram-negative bacteria were characterized by multiple resistance to antibiotics used in medical practice and to sulfathiazole. The strains showed the highest sensitivity to gentamicin and kanamycin. Most of the hospital strains were sensitive to chloramine and nirtan, but 4-13% of Klebsiella and Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains showed enhanced resistance to 0.1% chloramine solution.
