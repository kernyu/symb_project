Changes in bone, cartilage and the dentition in animals and man following the administration of anticonvulsant drugs resemble those seen in hypoparathyroidism and pseudohypoparathyroidism. Groups of 21-day-old rats were treated with diphenylhydantoin, parathyroidectomized, or made hypocalcaemic with a calcium-deficient diet. Histological examination revealed extensive resorption of cementum and dentine in the molars of the drug-treated and parathyroidectomized rats, but not in the hypocalcaemic or control groups. Localization of injected tetracycline by fluorescence showed that the resorption affected the distal side of the tooth roots and had occurred after root formation. No changes in cementum formation on the mesial side of the roots had occurred in any of the experimental groups. These results suggest that diphenylhydantoin induces a condition similar to pseudohypoparathyroidism in which the resistance of tooth roots to resorption is reduced.
