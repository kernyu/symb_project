A case of septicemia by Corynebacterium group JK is reported in a polytraumatized patient. As the significant feature of this recently isolated group of bacteria is its resistance to almost all antibiotics, therapy of infections is very difficult. Infections can occur in immunocompromised hosts in intensive-care and oncological departments. Both sections should be monitored for these germs, because the JK group can be a part of the normal flora of healthy individuals.
