A case of severe bilateral pulmonary tuberculosis is presented. During treatment, the patient developed resistance to a total of six drugs. The reasons were poor patient compliance and incorrect treatment. In order to avoid problems with resistant strains, it is important that the departments undertaking treatment have experience with the medicinal treatment and understanding of the problem of compliance.
