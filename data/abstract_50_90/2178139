Enterococcus faecalis strain D434 was found to carry on its chromosome a determinant encoding tetracycline-minocycline resistance (Tcr-Mnr) and to harbor both an R plasmid and a cryptic conjugative plasmid, pIP1141. The determinant coding for Tcr-Mnr was located on a conjugative transposon, designated Tn3702. The transposition of Tn3702 on to both pIP1141 and the hemolysin plasmid pIP964 yielded different derivatives each of which contained an 18.5-kilobase insert. The structure of Tn3702 is similar to that of the conjugative transposon Tn916.
