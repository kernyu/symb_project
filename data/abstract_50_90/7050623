Clorobiocin, an inhibitor of the gyrB subunit of DNA gyrase, was used for the curing of some Escherichia coli plasmids. Of the plasmids studied, ampicillin resistant R28K and a miniplasmid derived from R1drd-19 were effectively eliminated. We also succeeded in eliminating the ColA factor from E. coli strain B834(pBS103), which was resistant to the effect of currently used curing agents. Although a derivative of ColE1-pBR322 was effectively cured by clorobiocin, the ColE1 plasmid was resistant to its effect. The ColV plasmid determining virulence was effectively eliminated.
