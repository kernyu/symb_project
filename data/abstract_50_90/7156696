During the April 1979--June 1978 period, 1161 tests were carried out on the sensitivity to antibiotics and chemotherapeutical agents of Gram-negative bacillus strains isolated from 7632 urocultures. Resistance was tested under qualitative control against 13 antimicrobial agents by the Kirby-Bauer diffusimetric method. The resistance sensitivity and the presence of intermediary strains is shown for E. coli Citrobacter, Enterobacter, Klebsiella, Proteus, Morganella, Providencia, and Pseudomonas. Attention is drawn to the fairly high proportion of intermediary strains. Their role from the therapeutical point of view is reduced, but epidemiologically, their role is important since their evolution towards resistance or sensitivity cannot be foreseen.
