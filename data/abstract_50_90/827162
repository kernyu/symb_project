Sensitivity of 144 L. casei cultures and 23 L. plantarum cultures to the action of 39 bacteriocins produced by lactobacillae of different species was studied by the method of delayed antagonism. By the bacteriocin sensitivity the L. casei cultures were subdivided into 37 and L. plantarum cultures--into 7 bacteriocin types. The method of bacteriocin typing permitted differentiation of the L. casei and L. plantarum cultures, which had the same biochemical and physiological properties, as a number of bacteriocin types.
