Two spontaneous mutants of Escherichia coli strain KMBL-146 selected for resistance to the aminoglycoside antibiotic neamine show severe restriction of amber suppressors in vivo. Purified ribosomes from the mutant strains exhibit low neamine-induced misreading in vitro and a decreased affinity for the related antibiotic streptomycin. Biochemical analysis shows that the mutants each have two modified 30S ribosmal proteins, S12 and S5. In agreement with these results, genetic analysis shows that two mutations are present, neither of which confers resistance to neamine by itself; the mutation located in gene rpxL (the structural gene for protein S12) confers streptomycin dependence but this dependence is suppressed in the presence of the second mutation, located in gene rpxE (the structural gene for protein S5).
