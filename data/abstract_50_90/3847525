BRL 25000 (187.5 and 375 mg tablets), a formulation of CVA-K and AMPC in the ratio of 1:2, and AMPC (as control drug) were administered to healthy volunteers, aged 20 approximately 28 years and weighing 60 approximately 85 kg (68.8 kg, on average). Each drug was administered 3 times a day (after meals) for 5 days and the volunteers were separated into 3 groups of 4 subjects each. The effect on the fecal flora was studied before dosage, during administration (day 3 and 5) and day 3 and 5 after the administration course was completed. Studies were undertaken to isolate C. difficile on the last day of administration and 3 and 5 days after administration had ceased. Fecal concentrations and the susceptibility of the isolates to AMPC, CVA-K and BRL 25000 were measured. Side effects and laboratory findings were studied. The results obtained were as follows: 1. In BRL 25000 (187.5 mg X 3/day) group, the population of E. coli was on average, 1 X 10(6) approximately 9 X 10(6) cells/g feces before initiation of administration and it increased by 2 logarithms 3 and 5 days after initiation of administration. By 3 and 5 days after end of administration, the E. coli population was similar to the initial population. The population of Klebsiella sp. was 1 X 10(6) approximately 9 X 10(6) cells/g feces on average before commencement of dosage and it increased by 2 logarithms 3 days after initiation of administration but there was no consistent change in the Klebsiella sp. population thereafter. The Enterobacter sp., population was not consistent neither was the population of other Enterobacteriaceae. In total, the mean Enterobacteriaceae population was 1 X 10(7) approximately 9 X 10(7) cells/g feces before initiation of administration and increased by 2 logarithms 3 days after initiation of administration, and then returned to the initial level 5 days after end of administration. No consistent changes in population were noted for the other Gram-negative bacilli. The Staphylococcus sp. population was 1 X 10(6) approximately 9 X 10(6) cells/g feces on average before initiation of administration. This organism was detected in only 1 case 3 days after initiation of administration and in another 5 days after initiation of administration, thereafter, the population was similar to the initial population.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
