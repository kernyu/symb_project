The transferability of plasmid pRI405 between various streptococci of groups A, B, and D, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus aureus is described. pRI405 originated from Streptococcus faecalis and encodes for resistance to macrolides, lincomycin, and streptogramin B (MLS resistance). The host range of the well-documented streptococcal plasmid pAM beta 1 was found to be similar to that of pRI405. Cleavage with restriction enzymes suggests that pRI405 belongs to a related family of MLS resistance plasmids.
