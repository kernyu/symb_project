A new shuttle vector pCEM500 replicating in Escherichia coli and in Brevibacterium flavum was constructed. It carries two antibiotic resistance determinants (Kmr/Gmr from plasmid pSa of Gram-negative bacteria and Smr/Spr from plasmid pCG4 of Corynebacterium glutamicum) which are efficiently expressed in both hosts and can be inactivated by insertion of DNA fragments into the unique restriction endonuclease sites located within them. This vector was found to be stably maintained in B. flavum and can be used for transfer of the cloned genes into this amino-acid-producing coryneform bacterium.
