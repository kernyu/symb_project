Immunostimulant activities of muramyl dipeptide (enhancement of specific immune responses and of nonspecific resistance to infection) were retained by its N-acetylmuramyl-L-alanyl-D-glutaminyl-n-butyl ester derivative, although very large amounts administered intravenously, or even by the very sensitive intracerebroventricular route, did not elicit fever in the rabbit. This analog also appeared to be devoid of other secondary effects which have been observed after administration of muramyl dipeptide.
