Muramyl tripeptide-phosphatidylethanolamine (MTP-PE, CGP 19835) displays prophylactic antiviral activity in mice infected with influenza viruses A and B, parainfluenza 1 virus or herpes simplex type 1 viruses (HSV/1) and in guinea pigs infected with herpes simplex type 2 viruses (HSV/2). MTP-PE is effective when given in a single intranasal dose as early as 1-4 weeks before infection. In the case of HSV/2 infections, prophylactic effectiveness can be demonstrated after a single topical application into the vagina seven days before infection. Antiviral effects are observed in response to doses as little as 0.001 mg/kg bodyweight. The activity of the substance seems to be inversely related to the size of the viral inoculum, but poor dose-effect relation is demonstrable in a dose-range extending over four to five orders of magnitude. Furthermore, the compound is devoid of antiviral effects in vitro. MTP-PE does not induce interferon (IFN) in serum and lung, nor does it influence kinetics or quantity of serum and lung IFN content in the course of viral infections. However, when given intranasally 7 days before an oral dose of tilorone, increased levels of IFN in lung suspensions are observed.
