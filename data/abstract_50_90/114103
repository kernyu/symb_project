Wide distribution of streptomycin resistance determinants (83 per cent) among the resistance plasmids of the clinical strains of Ps. aeruginosa isolated in several clinics of 2 towns was found. Nine plasmids determining resistance to this antibiotic, as well as some other antibiotics, sulfanilamides, metallic ions, hydroxyanions and UV radiation were studied. The frequency of the conjugation transfer in these plasmids was different, i.e. from 10(1) to 10(6). They belonged to the following incompatibility groups: P-1, P-2, P-5 and apparently P-3. Eight out of the 9 plasmids determined the synthesis of streptomycin phosphotransferase which was evident of wide distribution of the streptomycin inactivation mechanism by phosphorylation among the strains of Ps. aeruginosa. The strains carrying the plasmids significantly differed by the content of the enzyme. However, all the enzymes could inactivate only streptomycin and dihydrostreptomycin and had approximately the same molecular weight (about 20 000). The strain carrying plasmid pBSII had no enzyme inactivating streptomycin (by phosphorylation or adenylation). The antibiotic resistance determined by this plasmid must be connected with changes in permeability of the bacterial cell wall by streptomycin.
