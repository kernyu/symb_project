Palytoxin causes within minutes a temperature-dependent K+ loss from human and rat erythrocytes which is followed within hours by haemolysis. It decreases the osmotic resistance in a concentration-dependent manner, so that osmotic influences are negligible for K+ release but considerable in haemolysis. External K+ inhibits the haemoglobin release and Rb+ inhibits the release of K+ and haemoglobin. Ca2+ (over 20 microM) and borate (over 5 microM) enhance the loss of K+ and haemoglobin. With both Ca2+ and borate present, the efficacy of palytoxin is raised about 10 000-fold. Under these conditions, about 15 palytoxin molecules per human cell trigger a 50% K+ loss over a wide range of cell concentrations. The palytoxin effect is reversible. After depletion from K+ by low concentrations of palytoxin, human cells can be refilled with K+ and resealed. The pores formed by palytoxin are small. They allow the entrance of Na+ and choline, whereas inositol is largely excluded and Ca2+, as well as sucrose and inulin, are completely excluded. Amphotericin B resembles palytoxin in its ability to cause a considerable prelytic K+ loss and to form small pores. However, it is about 1000-times weaker than palytoxin, is not inhibited by K+ or Rb+, is not activated by Ca2+ or borate, and has a negative temperature dependence. Thus palytoxin represents a novel type of cytolysin.
