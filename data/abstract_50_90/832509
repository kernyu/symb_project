The bacteriostatic activity of fosfomycin was studied in vitro against 1,243 clinical isolations of gram-positive cocci and 4,086 isolations of gram-negative bacilli that were obtained in 1973, 1974 and in the period from January to May of 1975. MIC was determined by the agar diffusion method, quantifying it by means of the standard curve that was worked out with the strain of E. coli NCTC 10,418. A slight increase in resistance was observed in the gram-positive cocci: 64 mug/ml were inhibitory for 63% of the 249 isolations obtained in 1973, 59.1% of the 716 isolations obtained in 1974, and 57.5% of the 278 isolations from 1975. A slight loss of sensitivity was also observed in the gram-negative bacilli: the aforementioned concentration of fosfomycin inhibited 36% of the 742 isolations from 1973, 33.6% of the 2,387 isolations from 1974 and 32.6% of the 957 isolations from 1975. 933 g of this antibiotic were consumed in our hospital in 1973, 4,203 g in 1974 and 957 g in 1975. The consumption rate per patient per year was 0.15, 0.72 and 0.20 g, respectively. In conclusion, although no change was observed in the sensitivity of some bacterial strains to fosfomycin, the overall study indicates a slight decrease in the sensitivity, although it does not apparently have any relationship to the consumption of fosfomycin in our hospital.
