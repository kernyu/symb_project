A 27-year-old man sustained a thorn injury to his left eye and a culture-proven Fusarium oxysporum endophthalmitis developed. This was successfully treated with a vitrectomy, intravitreal and intravenous amphotericin B, and oral flucytosine. The patient maintains 20/20 vision at this time in his left eye. We recommend combined therapy for this filamentous fungal infection.
