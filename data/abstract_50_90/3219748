The Authors report microbiological data on the inhibitory activity of cephalothin, cefamandole, FCE 22101, gentamicin, netilmicin, amikacin, rifampicin, clindamycin, josamycin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, vancomycin and teicoplanin against 165 clinically isolated Staphylococcus aureus strains. 34 of the study strains, i.e. 20.6%, were methicillin- and oxacillin-resistant. The activity of the tested drugs was good; the presence of nosocomial strains resistant to rifampicin (12.13%), clindamycin (13.94%), josamycin (18.2%), ofloxacin (4.85%), ciprofloxacin (12.7%), gentamicin (27.3%), amikacin (9.7%), netilmicin (7.9%) was noted. The Authors emphasize the good inhibitory activity of tested beta-lactam drugs against methicillin-sensitive Staphylococci, but also the limits of these drugs against methicillin-resistant strains. The activity of vancomycin and teicoplanin on all study strains was very good.
