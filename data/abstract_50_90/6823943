Eubacterium is a commensal of the human gastrointestinal tract. In rare instances this organism can become blood-borne. Nine cases of bacteremia were described and eight cases were found in the medical literature. Thirteen of the 17 cases (76%) had active gastrointestinal disease leading to the Eubacterium bacteremia. It is suggested that recovery of Eubacterium in blood culture should alert the clinician to the possibility of active gastrointestinal disease including occult neoplasms.
