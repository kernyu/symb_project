The DNA segment (Tn903) with a size of 3100 nucleotide pairs which carries a gene specifying kanamycin resistance derived from a chimeric plasmid pML21 (Hershfield et al., 1976) was transposed to various sites on the filamentous phage fd DNA. Wild type fd can be restored by excision of Tn903 from the resulting hybrid DNA molecule. The fd DNA carrying Tn903 when converted to the mature phage particle, was capable of transducing the kanamycin marker, and its replicative form DNA could be maintained in a bacterial cell like a plasmid.
