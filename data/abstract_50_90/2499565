With cefpirome (HR 810) the MICs for both methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and for Streptococcus faecalis were 8.0 mg/l. At 4 x MIC, cefpirome killed MRSA as rapidly as did vancomycin while for enterococci, cefpirome, vancomycin or ampicillin alone were not bactericidal. However, all agents were bactericidal when combined with 2 mg/l of gentamicin, although gentamicin combined with cefpirome showed a smaller decrease in cfu/ml than the combination with ampicillin or vancomycin. A mouse thigh infection model was developed in which the thigh muscle was infected with bacteria and either no therapy or concurrent antibiotic therapy was initiated. On the subsequent day, the entire thigh muscle was quantitatively cultured. In this model, the numbers of enterococci at the infection site at 24 h were reduced by 2.1 logs with no treatment, 2.6 with cefpirome (25 mg/kg/day), 2.8 with ampicillin (150 mg/kg/day), and 2.7 with vancomycin (25 mg/kg/day). For MRSA the reductions were 1.1 logs with no therapy, 2.8 with vancomycin, and 3.0 with cefpirome. The apparent enhanced in-vivo activity of cefpirome for MRSA argues for further evaluation of this antibiotic for treatment of MRSA and other Gram-positive cocci, including enterococci.
