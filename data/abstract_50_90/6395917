Genetically obese (ob/ob) mice develop insulin resistance in brown adipose tissue during the fifth week of life. Prior to this, at 26 days of age, ob/ob mice show a substantial increase in GDP binding to brown-adipose-tissue mitochondria during acute cold exposure. When insulin resistance in brown fat develops, by 35 days of age, the increase in GDP binding in response to cold is markedly reduced. Studies with 2-deoxyglucose suggest that insulin resistance in brown adipose tissue could impair thermogenic responsiveness during acute cold exposure by limiting the ability of the tissue to take up glucose.
