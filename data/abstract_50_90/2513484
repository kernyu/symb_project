Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) induce kappa transcription in 70Z/3 cells by different mechanisms; LPS treatment induces both NF-kappa B and OTF-2 transcription factors, but IFN-gamma treatment does not. We have dissected these two activation pathways by selecting and analyzing an LPS+ IFN- variant of 70Z/3.
