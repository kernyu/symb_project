Aztreonam (AZT), a new monobactam antibiotic, was studied in obstetrics and gynecology with the following results. The tissue concentration of AZT in the female genital organs was relatively high at the portio vaginalis and the cervix uteri followed by at the ovary and the myometrium, but the distribution to the endometrium and the oviduct was a little poor. The concentration of AZT in the pelvic dead space exudate was highest at 2 hours after intravenous injection whereas it was highest at 5 hours after intravenous drip infusion. However, there was no significant difference in the concentration between intravenous injection and intravenous drip infusion and the distribution to the pelvic dead space exudate was relatively good. AZT was clinically administered to pyometra (3 cases), puerperal endometritis (3), adnexitis and endometritis (3), pelvioperitonitis (1), Bartholin's abscess (4) and purulent vulvitis (1), a total of 15 cases with an overall effective rate of 93.3%. AZT was microbiologically effective for Gram-negative bacteria such as E. coli and K. pneumoniae, but also effective for anaerobes and some Gram-positive bacteria, etc., for which MIC of AZT is high. With regard to safety of AZT, neither side effects nor abnormal laboratory findings were reported.
