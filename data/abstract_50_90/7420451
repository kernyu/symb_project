Species of Serratia, particularly S marcescens, are being isolated with increasing frequency from human sources. These organisms are responsible for serious infections, especially in hospitalized and/or compromised patients. The authors reviewed the frequency of isolation of Serratia species at Howard University Hospital and analyzed isolation and identification techniques and factors predisposing patients to colonization by these organisms. This paper presents the findings of the study.
