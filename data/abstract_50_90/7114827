The effect of several antibiotics on 4 rapid-growing Rhizobia, i. e. R. phaseoli, R. leguminosarum, R. trifolii and R. meliloti and 3 slow growing Rhizobia, i. e. R. vigna, R. japonicum and R. lupini was studied. It was shown that 4 of the species, i. e. R. meliloti, R. japonicum, R. vagna and R. lupini had multiple drug resistance. A tetracycline resistant mutant MC of R. japonicum was isolated.
