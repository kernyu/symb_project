Hybrid genes containing human gamma or beta globin gene promoters linked to a neomycin resistance (neoR) gene were transfected into erythroid (K562) and nonerythroid (HeLa) cells. The number of clones resistant to G418, a neomycin analogue, was used to assay promoter strength. The results indicate that in K562 cells both promoters are active, and the gamma gene promoter is much stronger than the beta. By contrast, neither gene promoter is active in HeLa cells. These experiments indicate that these globin gene promoters are tissue-specific and sufficient for activity.
