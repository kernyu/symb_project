The Staphylococcal strains, identified by "The Simplified Lyogroups System" were tested for their susceptibility to methicillin and some aminoglycosides. The results, besides showing a higher ratio of susceptibility against aminoglycosides in methicillin-susceptible (MS) strains, show a different trend within each lyogroup. A total of 1616 wild Staphylococcus strains were isolated in microbiological units in Catania, Messina, Rome and Genoa. The results show a high susceptibility to aminoglycosides, both in MS and methicillin-resistant (MR) groups but with different trends among lyogroups.
