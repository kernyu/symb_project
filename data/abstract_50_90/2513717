Two multicenter trials compared single-dose oral therapy with 400 mg of ofloxacin or 3 g of amoxicillin plus 1 g of probenecid in the treatment of uncomplicated gonorrhea in 160 men and 102 women. Patients with a known diagnosis of Chlamydia trachomatis infection were excluded. All pretreatment isolates of Neisseria gonorrhoeae were susceptible to ofloxacin (minimal inhibitory concentration less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml), whereas roughly 50 percent exhibited intermediate susceptibility to ampicillin (minimal inhibitory concentration, 0.125 to 2.0 micrograms/ml). Post-treatment culture results showed that ofloxacin had eradicated N. gonorrhoeae in 97.5 percent (41 men) of 42 men and all 28 women evaluated. Amoxicillin-probenecid achieved microbiologic cures in 92.7 percent (51 men) of 55 men and 92.6 percent (25 women) of 27 women evaluated. Clinical cure rates among initially symptomatic patients were 84.6 percent (33 men) of 39 men and 81.8 percent (nine women) of 11 women with ofloxacin and 83.0 percent (44 men) of 53 men and 66.7 percent (10 women) of 15 women with amoxicillin-probenecid. No drug-related adverse effects were noted in ofloxacin-treated patients. One patient each in the amoxicillin-probenecid group reported nausea, diarrhea, and vaginitis. These results demonstrate that single-dose ofloxacin is as effective as amoxicillin-probenecid in eradicating N. gonorrhoeae and relieving clinical signs and symptoms of gonococcal infections in both men and women.
