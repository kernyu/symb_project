This paper describes a microbiological study of 84 young adult men with clinical otitic infections. Gram-negative aerobic bacilli were frequently isolated from these patients diagnosed as having otitis externa or chronic suppurative otitis media, of which Pseudomonas species predominated. Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis and aerobic Corynebacterium species (diphtheroids) were also found. About 40% of ear infections were attributed to otomycoses, chiefly from Aspergillus species and Candida parapsilosis. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing of the bacterial isolates revealed that Pseudomonas species were generally resistant to antibiotics commonly employed in general practice: ampicillin, erythromycin, co-trimoxazole, tetracycline and cephaloridine. However, polymyxin B, gentamicin and neomycin were active against some Pseudomonas isolates. Other Gram-negative bacilli were also mainly sensitive to gentamicin, neomycin as well as co-trimoxazole. Disc diffusion and minimum inhibitory concentration studies demonstrated good activity of ceftazidime, cefoperazone, tobramycin and carbenicillin against strains of Pseudomonas species and other Gram-negative rods. Cefotaxime and cefoxitin were active against Gram-negative bacilli other than Pseudomonas species. Beta-lactamase production did not appear to be the main mechanism of resistance in these community-acquired Gram-negative bacillary isolates. The antimicrobial therapy of otological infections is reviewed.
