Routine screening for sexually transmitted diseases in new patients attending the Genitourinary Clinic in Stoke-on-Trent includes a culture for Mycoplasma hominis (MH) and Ureaplasma urealyticum (UU). A retrospective study was carried out on 400 female patients to ascertain whether there were any significant differences between the group positive for MH and UU and the negative control group. The positive group were found to be younger on average, but to have similar sexual histories to the negative control group. An association was found between the presence of genital mycoplasmas and Gardnerella vaginalis. An odourous vaginal discharge was more common in the positive group. Erythromycin was ineffective in eradicating the organisms in 62.5% of patients with MH, and 70% of those with UU. Continuing work is required to identify those women in whom the presence of MH or UU could have pathogenic effects. Treatment regimens for this group of women need to be carefully reassessed, in the light of increasing antibiotic resistance.
