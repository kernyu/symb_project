A procedure was developed which allows direct identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing of fermentative and nonfermentative gram-negative bacilli from positive blood cultures. A 10-ml sample was removed from turbid blood culture bottles, and the bacteria were washed and concentrated by centrifugation. The bacterial pellet was used to inoculate an Enterobacteriaceae Plus Identification Card and a Gram-Negative General Susceptibility Card of the AutoMicrobic system. Results with these cards were compared with results obtained with standard technique for 196 blood cultures seeded with recent clinical isolates. Identification of most cultures was available in 8 h, whereas the antimicrobial susceptibility results were available in an average of 4.7 h for all organisms. Direct identification was correct for 95% of the cultures, whereas the antimicrobial susceptibility data had an average agreement of 87% with 3.8% very major and 1.4% major errors. In using this procedure it was possible to provide accurate preliminary identification and results of antimicrobial susceptibility tests for gram-negative bacilli on the same day that a blood culture was determined to be positive.
