Immunization with MFS-180 vaccine prepared in the presence of glutaraldehyde (0.05%), lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (100 micrograms/ml), and concanavalin A (Con A) (200 micrograms/ml) could protect Swiss mice against a subsequent challenge by 1 X 10(6) MFS-180 cells. The sequence of attachment of LPS and Con A to glutaraldehyde-treated cells as found to determine the efficacy of the vaccine. LPS coupled with glutaraldehyde-treated cells before Con A could effect 100% survival, while LPS attached after Con A treatment to glutaraldehyde-treated cells showed only 60% survival. The protection was specific for syngeneic cells.
