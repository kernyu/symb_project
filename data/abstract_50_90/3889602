The ultraviolet radiation survival curve of exponentially growing cultures of Escherichia coli B/r WP2 trpE65 was modified by a short period (20 min) of chloramphenicol treatment before UV exposure, which produced an extended exponential section of intermediate slope between the shoulder and the final exponential slope. More prolonged incubation with chloramphenicol (up to 90 min) resulted in little further extension of the intermediate exponential slope, but caused a progressive expansion of the shoulder region. With each period of chloramphenicol pretreatment, a major surge of mutation to tryptophan independence always occurred after that UV fluence promoting the transition from the shoulder to the intermediate exponential slope of the survival curve, and another major surge occurred after that fluence promoting the transition from the intermediate exponential slope to the final exponential slope. A minor surge of mutation occurred after low fluences. The 3 surges in mutation and the increased slopes of the survival curve are ascribed to UV-inactivation of 3 qualitatively different DNA-repair systems, each with differentially increased resistances to UV caused by pretreatment by chloramphenicol.
