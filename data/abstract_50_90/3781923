Syntheses of cephalosporins modified with a 7 beta-[2-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-2-(substituted carbamoylmethoxyimino)acetamido] group at the C-7 position and with various hetero aromatics at the C-3 position are described. The effects of substituents on the carbamoyl group in the 7-side chain were investigated in order to improve antibacterial activity. Some of these compounds exhibited high antibacterial activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, as well as good resistance to beta-lactamase.
