Three patients with vulvovaginitis caused by Trichomonas vaginalis, which was refractory to conventional treatment with metronidazole are described. The T vaginalis strain isolated from one patient was resistant to metronidazole (minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) more than 100 mg/l) under aerobic conditions, although under anaerobic conditions it was as susceptible as a normal reference strain. The effect of the concomitant use of other medication and the influence of other vaginal pathogens on the efficacy of metronidazole are highlighted.
