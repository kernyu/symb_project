We delimited sequences necessary for in vivo expression of the Drosophila melanogaster dopa decarboxylase gene Ddc. The expression of in vitro-altered genes was assayed following germ line integration via P-element vectors. Sequences between -209 and -24 were necessary for normally regulated expression, although genes lacking these sequences could be expressed at 10 to 50% of wild-type levels at specific developmental times. These genes showed components of normal developmental expression, which suggests that they retain some regulatory elements. All Ddc genes lacking the normal immediate 5'-flanking sequences were grossly deficient in larval central nervous system expression. Thus, this upstream region must contain at least one element necessary for this expression. A mutated Ddc gene without a normal TATA boxlike sequence used the normal RNA start points, indicating that this sequences is not required for start point specificity.
