One hundred and forty isolates of beta-hemolytic streptococcus cultured from patients with clinical pharyngitis were studied by disc diffusion for antibiotic sensitivity to lincomycin, erythromycin, cephalexin and penicillin and by agar dilution to cephalexin and penicillin. All isolates were sensitive to </= 0.1 mug./ml. penicillin and </= 1.56 mug./ml. cephalexin. The disc-diffusion test was reliable in predicting the sensitivities in vitro. One strain of group A betahemolytic streptococcus was resistant to erythromycin by disc diffusion. When compared to Lancefield grouping 18% of strains were incorrectly identified as group A by the bacitracin-disc test. Cephalexin was uniformly effective in vitro in inhibiting beta-hemolytic streptococci and the 30 mug. cephalexin disc was reliable in predicting these sensitivities.
