Ribosomal protein S5 was isolated from wild type Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633 and from a spectinomycin resistant mutant (BSPC 111) derived from spectinomycin sensitive to resistance is accomtrypsin and all the tryptic peptides were isolated by column- and paper-chromatography. By comparative amino acid analyses of the peptides, it was demonstrated that the S5 from the mutant differs from the wild type S5 by a replacement of one amino acid, namely lysine by isoleucine in the peptide T9. The results are compared with E. coli spectinomycin resistant mutants.
