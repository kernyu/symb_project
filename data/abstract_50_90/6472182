The cephalosporins are a group of antibiotic agents that have been available now for 20 years. Three classes, or generations, of cephalosporins are recognized. The newer third-generation drugs have wider spectra of antibacterial activity; because of this attribute and their ability to achieve high bactericidal titres in CSF these newer compounds constitute an advance in antibiotic therapy by providing safe and effective treatment for Gram-negative bacillary meningitis. The earlier cephalosporins provide cheap, useful and convenient prophylaxis for vascular and orthopaedic operations near the inguinal area. Comparative trials with other broad-spectrum agents need to be performed before the true place of the third-generation agents in anti-infective therapy and prophylaxis is finally determined.
