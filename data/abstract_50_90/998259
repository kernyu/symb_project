An investigation of strains of Proteus morganii isolated from patients in Odense, Denmark, and of 21 serotype strains revealed a close correlation between the fermentation of trehalose and a non-transmissible resistance to tetracycline. The trehalose fermenting, tetracycline resistant strains had a longer flagellar wavelength than the non-fermenting, sensitive strains. Resistance to chloramphenicol occurred only in strains of the former group.
