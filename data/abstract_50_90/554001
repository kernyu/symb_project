As elsewhere in the world, the number of resistant enteric bacteria is rapidly increasing in this country. In a survey made in 1977 on about 40,000 strains of enteric bacteria in Clinical Pathology Laboratory of Hacettepe University Medical School, Ankara, Turkey, 70% to 97% of enteric bacteria were shown to be resistant to conventional antimicrobic agents. Also the rates of multiple-resistant strains of enteric bacteria are increasing quite rapidly. In most of these strains this increase proved to depend on the presence of R plasmids. In this paper, these and related facts were summarized and some precautions were suggested to lessen the increase of resistant strains in this country.
