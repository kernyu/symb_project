D-Cycloserine showed a decreased lethality against paraquat-treated E. coli than against non-treated cells. E. coli K12 mutants which were deficient in DNA repair were more sensitive than the wild type strain to D-cycloserine. Furthermore, D-cycloserine caused PM2 DNA cleavage in the presence of Fe2+, and the cleavage was strongly inhibited by singlet oxygen scavengers. These results indicate that D-cycloserine interacts with DNA and an active oxygen species is involved in the interaction.
