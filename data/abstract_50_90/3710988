The purpose of this investigation was to examine the relationship between an exercise program and fetal development to determine whether training could influence insulin sensitivity in the pregnant rat. Prior to impregnation one group of animals was exercise trained on a Quinton shock-stimulus rodent treadmill. The exercised group was trained to run 5 days/wk, for 2.0 h/day at 31 m/min up an 8 degree incline for 8 wk before mating. Following mating the training intensity was reduced to 27 m/min up a 5 degree incline, and the exercise period decreased to 1 h/day. On day 19 of gestation, 24 h postexercise for the trained mothers, the animals were killed in the fed state and the parametrial fat pads were removed. The parametrial depot of the trained mother was smaller than the sedentary control dam. This was due to a change in cell size and did not involve alterations in cell number. Isolated adipocytes of the parametrial fat pads were used to measure the rates of 2-deoxy-D-[3H]glucose uptake and D-[1-14C]glucose oxidation to 14CO2. The results indicated that the adipocytes from the dam trained prior to and during pregnancy were significantly (P less than 0.05) more responsive to insulin than those of animals remaining sedentary during the same period. At the maximal insulin concentration tested, the fat cells from trained mothers were able to take up and metabolize approximately twice as much glucose as the sedentary control dams. However, the increase in insulin responsiveness induced by the training program did not match the changes observed in trained nonpregnant rats of prior investigations.
