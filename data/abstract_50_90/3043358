Thirteen episodes of fever in bone marrow transplantation recipients (23 months to 11 years old children) were treated by ceftazidime (100-200 mg/kg/j) and netilmicin (7 mg/kg/j). Vancomycin was added at the 24th hour in 10 cases of persistent fever. 6 presumed agents of infection were isolated before antibiotic treatment: blood cultures (streptococci 2, staphylococcus 1, proteus 1), fecal sample (E. coli 1), urine (E. coli 1). Modifications of aerobic fecal flora were studied under this treatment. E. coli, staphylococci and enterococci were the mainly strains isolated. There were no third generation cephalosporins resistant Gram-negative bacteria. High level resistance to aminoglycosides was observed in enterococcal strains, isolated during and after treatment. Ceftazidime-netilmicin (+/- vancomycin) was an effective and safe combination for the management of febrile neutropenic episodes.
