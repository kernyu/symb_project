The effect of exogenic addition of purines and pyrimidines on trimethoprim sensitivity was studied in 134 vaccinal and virulent strains of the plague causative agent isolated at various periods in 12 natural plague foci. 74 strains proved to be sensitive to low concentrations of trimethoprim in the cultivation media irrespective of the presence or absence of thymine or thymidine in them. In this respect the strains differed from many other bacterial species which in the presence of thymidine or thymine were resistant to high concentrations of trimethoprim. 60 natural arginine deficient strains of the plague causative agent from Transcaucasia and Mongolia showed high levels of resistance to trimethoprim on media with thymine or thymidine. The possible mechanism of the plague microbe sensitivity to trimethoprim in the presence of thymine or thymidine is discussed with an account of the literature and original data.
