Because of its high morbidity and mortality, endocarditis will remain an important pediatric problem. Obtaining adequate culture information prior to starting antibiotics to ensure an accurate early diagnosis coupled with aggressive medical and surgical management is likely to give the best outcome. These patients are generally best handled by a team approach with the child's primary physician, cardiologist, infectious disease consultant, and cardiovascular surgeon working in close harmony.
