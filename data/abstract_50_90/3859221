Imipenem/cilastatin was used to treat 135 patients with bacteremia and signs of infection. Ninety percent responded favorably. The bacteriologic eradication rate was 98 percent among the 153 isolates. Only one patient had breakthrough bacteremia and this was a susceptible Clostridium septicum. In two isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, emergence of resistance to imipenem during therapy was noted and appeared to be responsible for clinical failure. Superinfection occurred in 13 patients and was responsible for two treatment failures.
