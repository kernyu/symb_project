Two hundred specimens from wound infection (surgical and non-surgical) were cultured for the isolation of anaerobic and aerobic bacteria. Positive cultures were obtained in 174 (87%) and 26(13%) were sterile. Anaerobes were isolated from 31(17.8%), as single culture in 6(3.4%) and as mixed culture with aerobes in 25(14.3%). Amongst anaerobes, anaerobic cocci were predominant (45.9%). Of aerobes Staph pyogenes (35%) was predominant. Metronidazole was the most effective drug against anaerobes and gentamicin against aerobes. No significant difference was noted in antimicrobial susceptibility of anaerobes of surgical and non-surgical wounds. Among aerobes high resistance was observed in surgical wounds.
