Six independent isolates of Klebsiella from hospital environmental sources in Malaysia were found to be resistant to at least ampicillin, carbenicillin, cefoperazone, chloramphenicol, gentamicin and tetracycline. On the basis of their antibiograms, they were divided into four antibiogroups. They transferred all or part of their multiple antibiotic resistance traits to E. coli by conjugation. The results suggest that these Klebsiella strains harbour self-transmissible R plasmids. The significance of these findings are discussed.
