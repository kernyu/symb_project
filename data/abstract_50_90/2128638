The evolution of the fluoroquinolones is described, and structure-activity relationships outlined. The in-vitro antimicrobial activities of ciprofloxacin, enoxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin and pefloxacin against a wide range of organisms are critically reviewed. In-vitro factors influencing fluoroquinolone activity are discussed. Reports of the acquisition of resistance to the fluoroquinolones are evaluated. Finally, possible future directions for this group of antibiotics are discussed.
