Meningococcal meningitis as well as meningococcal sepsis must be regarded as complications of an otherwise mild meningococcal infection of the nasopharynx. Only individuals without antibodies against a given meningococcal type will contract the above-mentioned diseases. Causal prophylactic measures have proved to be ineffective because of the great number of "carriers" of meningococci. Immunprophylaxis with specific polysaccharides is effective and presently available for use against types A and C but not against type B. Chemoprophylaxis is most effective when administered to those living in close quarters. Sulfonamides are the prophylaxis of choice agianst meningococci sensitive to sulfonamides. With the appearance of sulfonamide-resistant meningococci, the sulfonamide must be replaced by rifamycin or minocyclin. Though treatment with penicillin gives protection against infection, it does not eradicate the carrier state.
