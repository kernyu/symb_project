Aminoglycoside-2"-O-adenylyltransferase was inhibited by 7-hydroxytropolone. Inhibition was competitive with respect to the cosubstrate ATP and appeared to require the unique vicinal arrangement of oxygens found in 7-hydroxytropolone. Combinations of 7-hydroxytropolone plus the appropriate aminoglycoside substrates were active against resistant bacteria possessing the adenylyltransferase. No potentiation was observed against other aminoglycoside-resistant or -susceptible strains. The fact that the inhibition of an aminoglycoside-modifying enzyme overcomes the poor uptake of aminoglycosides in resistant strains points to the singular importance of the inactivating enzyme as a determinant of resistance.
