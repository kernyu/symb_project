Subclinical infection may play a role in capsular formation around silicone breast implants. To assess the possibility of antibiotic prophylaxis for prevention of capsular formation, knowledge of bacteria present in the female breast tissue and the resistance pattern of these bacteria is needed. Samples were taken from 25 patients (49 breasts) peroperatively during reduction mammaplasty with an impression pad method. The samples were placed in agar plates and incubated both aerobically and anaerobically. In more than 90% of the samples bacteria were found. The species of bacteria found were mainly Staphylococcus epidermidis and propionibacteria. These bacteria were sensitive to penicillin G and/or isoxapenicillin. It remains to be shown that prophylactic antibiotic treatment will decrease capsular formation following augmentation mammaplasty.
