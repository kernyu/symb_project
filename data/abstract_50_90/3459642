The interaction of cefotiam with each of the four aminoglycosides gentamicin, tobramycin, netilmicin and amikacin were studied by the broth microdilution method ("checkerboard" technique) against 36 strains of Enterobacteriaceae chosen for their moderate susceptibility (MIC: 4-32 mg/l) or resistance (MIC: 64-512 mg/l) to cefotiam. A high rate of synergistic combinations was found with all the aminoglycosides: 81% with gentamicin, 76% with amikacin, 67% with tobramycin and netilmicin. The therapeutic value of these interactions appeared excellent.
