The resistance to antibiotics of 240 Shigella strains isolated in Somalia from 1973 to 1976 was studied. Many strains, particularly those of Shigella dysenteriae type 1, were found to be resistant to more than one drug. In view of their resistance to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, streptomycin, tetracycline, and sulfonamides, it is suggested that polymyxin B or M sulfate - which have proved to be effective in vivo - should be used for the treatment of clinically typical cases of bacillary dysentery.
