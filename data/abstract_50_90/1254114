The insulin sensitivity of the peripheral tissues in ob/ob mice treated with oxytetracycline was assessed both in vivo and in vitro by measuring the effect of insulin on the incorporation of glucose into glycogen in diaphragm muscle and on the incorporation of glucose and 3H2O into lipids in epidymal adipose tissue. The results indicated that OTC treatment improved the insulin sensitivity of muscle but not that of adipose tissue. The results presented also indicated that oxytetracycline treatment led to a decrease in the basal incorporation of lipids into the liver in vivo and the adipose tissue in vivo and in vitro. The results are discussed in view of the relative importance of liver and adipose tissue in the lipid metabolism of ob/ob and lean mice and in view of results obtained by other workers on the effects of B-cell cytotoxic agents.
