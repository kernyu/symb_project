The in vitro activities of the new spectinomycin analog U-63366, the new macrolide roxithromycin (RU 28965), and five new quinolone derivatives (pefloxacin, rosoxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, and ciprofloxacin) were studied against 23 multiresistant strains of Haemophilus ducreyi (beta-lactamase producers) isolated in Paris and were compared with the activities of tetracycline, minocycline, chloramphenicol, streptomycin, kanamycin, gentamicin, spectinomycin, erythromycin, and nalidixic acid. All strains were uniformly susceptible to the seven new antibiotics tested. Ciprofloxacin had the greatest inhibitory effect in vitro (the MIC for 90% of the strains tested [MIC90] was 0.016 microgram/ml), and U-63366 was the most active aminoglycoside-aminocyclitol antibiotic (MIC90, 0.25 microgram/ml).
