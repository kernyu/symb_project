The authors studied the Serratia marcescens (strain No. 851) resistance to the okcbm mixture by the method of test objects in comparison with the vaccine virus (strain B-51) at a temperature of 20, 30, and 40 degrees C. Resistance of the mentioned bacteria to the okcbm mixture proved to be somewhat greater than that of the vaccine virus at 20 and 30 degrees C, whereas at 40 degrees C their resistance was found to be practically identical. This permits to use Serratia marcescens to control the efficacy of gaseous sterilization of materials.
