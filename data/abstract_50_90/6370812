Heavy metals, including mercury, have recently been in discussion in connection with ecology and therapy. As Meditonsin represents a 0,004% solution of mercury cyanide the following were investigated: absorption, excretion, effect on the kidneys and the chemical behaviour of mercury cyanide and other mercury salts as well as the antimicrobial effectivity in in vitro tests. With the dose recommended for adults neither an increase of mercury ions nor an increased excretion of these could be detected in the blood or the urine respectively. Even in minimal inhibitory concentrations Meditonsin is characterised in the in vitro tests by an excellent antimicrobial effect.
