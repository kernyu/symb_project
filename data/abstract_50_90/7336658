Simultaneous use of ribavirin (I-beta-D-ribofuranosyl-1,2,4-triazol-3-carboxamide and rimantadine (alpha-methyl-I-adamantane methylamine HCL) was shown to effect most distinctly on protein synthesis in influenza virus A in the system studied as compared with the separate action of each of the drugs. Ribavirine inhibited the protein synthesis in rimantadine-resistant strain of influenza virus A.
