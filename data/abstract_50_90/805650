This presentation deals with the historical development of the antifolate pyrimidines and related compounds, first as antimalarial substances and later as potent antibacterial agents. It describes the first quantitation of the combined action, through sequential blockade, of the substances with sulfonamides, and outlines the usefulness of the combinations in the therapy of normally sensitive and multiresistant strains of Plasmodium falciparum.
