Seven serotypes of Klebsiella pneumoniae isolated from different patients demonstrated resistance to the same eight antibiotics. A plasmid carrying resistance determinants to these antibiotics and mercury salts could be transferred in toto to a plasmidless strain of Escherichia coli. All E. coli transconjugants showed the same antibiotic resistance pattern. Digestion with restriction endonucleases yielded patterns that were identical for each of the R-factor transferred from the multiply resistant serotypes. Moreover, deoxyribonucleic acid-deoxyribonucleic acid hybridization demonstrated identity between the probe, pMAC20 (an R-factor from one serotype), and all R-factors isolated from the multiply resistant strains of K. pneumoniae and the E. coli transconjugants tested.
