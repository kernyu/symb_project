During 10 years 1063 patients were treated with lincomycin used parentally or orally at the N. N. Priorov Central Research Institute of Traumatology and Orthopedy. The doses and the rate of its use depended on the state of the patient, its age and weight. Lincomycin was used for the treatment of patients with osteomyelitis or purulent wound infection, as well as for prophylaxis of suppuration. The drug was used for a long period of time under conditions of the same hospital, and it was shown that it remained up to the present days highly effective in therapy of infections and especially bone infections caused by staphylococci sensitive to it. The 10-year study of staphylococcal sensitivity to lincomycin revealed an insignificant increase in the development of resistance to it. The paper presents data on the importance of adequate surgical interventions in addition to the antibiotic therapy in cases with bone infections. A possibility of lincomycin combined use with other antibiotics and gentamicin or kanamycin in particular was shown. Complications, such as diarrhea and urticaria were registered in 11 patients.
