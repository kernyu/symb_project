The new in vitro activity of temocillin (BRL 17421), a new beta-lactamase-stable penicillin, was compared with those of other beta-lactam antibiotics for over 500 clinical bacterial isolates. Temocillin inhibited 94% of the Enterobacteriaceae organisms at concentrations of 0.5 to 8 microgram/ml, regardless of organisms resistance to ampicillin, ticarcillin, cefazolin, or combinations thereof. Most pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates and all staphylococci and streptococci tested were resistant to temocillin.
