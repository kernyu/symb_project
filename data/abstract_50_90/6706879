Results of qualitative in vitro sensitivity tests made with growth promoting antimicrobial agents on clostridia, lactobacilli and enteric streptococci, isolated from caeca of pigs, cattle and poultry, are summarized. The compounds were active in vitro against most of the 19 bacterial species studied. However, their activity spectra differed markedly. Only four bacterial species were naturally sensitive to all agents. The natural resistances, typical for many species and compounds, could be differentiated from the acquired resistances found with all growth promotors except avoparcin. High resistance and complex patterns of cross-resistance involving one or more of the macrolide, lincosamide and streptogramin antibiotics were detected.
