The effect of piperacillin (PIP), cefotaxime (CTX), cefoxitin (CXT) on the natural resistance to C. albicans infection has been evaluated in vivo, in normal or neutropenic mice, in correlation with the PMN count in the peripheral blood. In neutropenic mice treated with PIP or CTX, the number of PNN increased more rapidly and higher than in CXT treated or control mice. A dose dependent increased resistance to infection was observed in PIP treated mice. It did not parallelled the PMN level found in different group of mice. The explanations might be a decrease of functional activity of PMN and/or an increase proliferation and differentiation of others effector cytotoxic cells.
