The in vitro susceptibility to gentamicin, tobramycin, amikacin and netilmicin in septicaemia isolates was followed during 1980-1984 in 6-8 Swedish laboratories. The bacterial distribution was similar over the years and was dominated by Escherichia coli and staphylococci. Resistance to gentamicin was found in 2.3-3.6%, to tobramycin in 1.4-3.4%, to amikacin and netilmicin in 0.5-0.9%. Production of aminoglycoside modifying enzymes was observed among resistant strains.
