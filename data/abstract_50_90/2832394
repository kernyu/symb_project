We describe a genetic system in which transformation of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus sanguis was used to insert recombinant DNA into the conjugative chromosomal element omega (cat tetM) 6001 (omega 6001). The element containing the recombinant DNA was then transferred by conjugation to the chromosome of transformable and nontransformable streptococci. When Escherichia coli plasmid pDP36 was used as donor in transformation, it was capable of inserting 5.9 kilobases of heterologous DNA into the chromosome of competent streptococcal strains carrying omega 6001; the transformants were scored for erythromycin resistance. Genetic analysis showed that in a fraction of the erythromycin-resistant transformants the integration via flanking homology of the heterologous DNA caused inactivation of the tetM gene of omega 6001. By analyzing the stability of the resistance markers, we found that stable integration of heterologous DNA was achieved only in the erythromycin-resistant, tetracycline-sensitive transformants. It was possible to detect conjugal transfer of the heterologous sequences from stable transformants to strains of S. pneumoniae, S. sanguis, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus faecalis. The omega 6001-pDP36 host-vector system opens new possibilities for gene transfer in streptococci. By this method cloned streptococcal DNA (possibly mutagenized in vitro) can be returned to the original host, greatly facilitating complementation tests and fine physiological studies.
