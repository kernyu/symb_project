Tuberculosis is a common disease in developing countries. An increasing incidence of resistance to isoniazid (INH) and streptomycin in organisms isolated from patients who contracted their disease in these countries, particularly in the Far East, is well recognized. This drug resistance has led to the recommendation of empirically beginning a regimen in patients with tuberculosis from the Far East of INH, ethambutol, and rifampin. This report documents the increasing incidence of resistance in isolates from Korea to ethambutol and rifampin in addition to INH and streptomycin. It suggests that the empiric use of INH, ethambutol, and rifampin in this group of patients could potentially lead to resistance to all of these drugs because of a significant amount of multidrug resistance. A regimen of INH, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and capreomycin is suggested as appropriate initial therapy in these patients based on the in vitro sensitivity data presented and initial clinical experience.
