The research activities of the Veterinary Research Institute, Onderstepoort, from its inception in 1908 until recent times are reviewed in this first article of a series on nematode epidemiology of sheep and cattle. While the taxonomic and certain biological aspects of the subject and the testing of anthelmintic compounds have been well covered on the whole in various parts of the country, the testing of control methods under field conditions has largely been neglected. It is suggested that all known methods of integrated worm control should be scrutinized and the most promising methods be tested under practical farming conditions in the country to reduce our dependence on anthelmintic compounds for worm control. Furthermore, unless we are able to employ the available anthelmintics to better advantage and thus reduce the tempo of selection for resistance, the situation may well develop where highly effective remedies are no longer available for worm control.
