Polymer complexons, such as copolymers of vinylpyrrolidone with vinyliminodiacetic acid and metacryloilacetone changed the permeability of the bacterial cell wall due to chelating of the metalic ions contained in the cell wall. An increase in the bacterial sensitivity to chloretracycline, methicillin, ampicillin and methicillin was observed in the presence of the above complexons.
