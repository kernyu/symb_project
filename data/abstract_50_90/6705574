We review factors affecting survival of 44 episodes of prosthetic valve endocarditis occurring in 39 patients from 1965 to 1982. The mortality was 31.8 percent (14/44), and 21.6 percent (8/37) if the fungal cases are excluded. The development of a new murmur of valvular regurgitation in 18 patients led to valve replacement or death in every patient. Streptococcal endocarditis in 11 patients resulted in no deaths and only two valve replacements; staphylococcal infections had a mortality of 27.1 percent (6/22). Length of medical therapy before valve replacement did not relate to a successful outcome. Eight cases of early staphylococcal endocarditis occurred in which the organism was susceptible to the prophylactic antibiotic therapy. Changes in prophylaxis have led to no cases of early endocarditis over the past three years in 261 valve replacements.
