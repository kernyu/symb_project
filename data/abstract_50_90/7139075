A concanavalin-A-resistant mutant of Chinese-hamster ovary cells has been shown to have altered cholesterol content and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase activity compared to wild-type and spontaneous-revertant cell lines. These changes are associated with insensitivity of the mutant reductase activity to suppression by low-density lipoprotein and impaired receptor-mediated binding and uptake of 125I-labelled low-density lipoprotein.
