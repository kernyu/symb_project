A gene encoding AAC(6') mediated resistance to netilmicin and amikacin was cloned from the chromosome of a nosocomial strain of Serratia marcescens into the BamHI site of pACYC184. The resistance determinant was localized to a sequence of approximately 1 kb. A 490 base pair BamHI-PvuII restriction fragment from the cloned DNA was used as a probe in Southern hybridization studies. Homology with a 920 base pair fragment of PvuII digested S. marcescens DNA from AAC(6')-producing strains was observed. No homology was detected with aminoglycoside sensitive S. marcescens or Escherichia coli.
