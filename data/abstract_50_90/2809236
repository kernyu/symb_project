Altogether 403 Haemophilus spp. were isolated in seven hospital laboratories in Hong Kong during June 1986, mostly from sputum. Of these 73% were Haemophilus influenzae and 27% Haemophilus parainfluenzae. All the isolates of H. influenzae were non-capsulated; Haemophilus spp. were not isolated from blood or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) during the period of the study. Antimicrobial resistance, including multiple resistance, was common. Of all the strains of H. influenzae, 20% were resistant to 1 mg/l ampicillin, (all except one by production of TEM-1 beta-lactamase), 65% were resistant to 0.5 mg/l erythromycin, 25% to 1 mg/l tetracycline, 14% to 1 mg/l chloramphenicol (mediated by the production of a chloramphenicol-destroying enzyme) and less than 1% to 8 mg/l cefaclor and 0.5 mg/l trimethoprim. All isolates were susceptible to cephamandole and cefuroxime. Haemophilus parainfluenzae showed similar susceptibilities, except that a greater proportion of strains was sensitive to erythromycin and chloramphenicol. Only 50% of the ampicillin-resistant strains of H. influenzae and H. parainfluenzae contained detectable plasmids of 2-55 Mdal arranged in six to nine different plasmid profiles. Resistance to ampicillin and chloramphenicol has increased markedly in isolates of H. influenzae in Hong Kong over the last 5 years. This resistance may be associated with transposable genes.
