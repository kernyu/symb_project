The study of a number of biological properties of 1881 clinical strains of Staphylococcus showed that in the group of the antibiotic resistant staphylococci there was a tendency for different manifestation of some biological properties depending on the number of the resistance determinants. The staphylococcal strains resistant to 5--7 antibiotics differed from those resistant to a less number of the drugs by greater manifestation of the pathogenicity properties: lecithinase, hyaluronidase and hemolytic activity.
