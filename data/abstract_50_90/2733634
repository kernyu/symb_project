A plasmid encoding streptomycin-resistance could be detected in 13 of 32 Pasteurella multocida-cultures isolated from cattle and swine. The plasmid of these cultures proved to be similar upon Southern blot hybridization. It could be transformed into Escherichia coli 490A, where it also expressed streptomycin resistance.
