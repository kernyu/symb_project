This work studies bacteriological characters of 25 strains of V. cholerae isolated in Mali during the outbreak of 1984-1987. These strains were precisely identified by biochemistry characters, toxin secretion, presence of a structure considered as attachment factor. Antibiotic susceptibility study confirmed the great sensibility of V. cholerae to this products, and allowed to classify them according to their Cl90. This contribution of the laboratory is very interesting for the control of the disease and the choice of standardized scheme of treatment.
