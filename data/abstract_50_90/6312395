The in vitro activity of cefmenoxime (SCE 1365), a new cephalosporin derivate was compared with two other "third generation" cephalosporins: cefotaxime and moxalactam. Cefmenoxime as cefotaxime and moxalactam were very active against 305 cephalosporinase-producing and cephalosporinase-non-producing Enterobacteriaceae. Cefmenoxime was the most active against Serratia marcescens, Citrobacter freundii, Morganella morganii, Salmonella, Shigella and Yersinia enterocolitica with a mean MIC at least twice lower. Several strains of the species Hafnia alvei, Providencia stuartii and Proteus vulgaris were more resistant. Against Haemophilus influenzae, the activity of the three cephalosporins was higher with a mean MIC between 0,030 and 0,040 microgram/ml. Against carbenicillin-sensible or carpenicillin-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, the three cephalosporins were not performant. Against Staphylococcus aureus, cefmenoxime and cefotaxime had an identical activity with a mean MIC of 1,5 microgram/ml against methicillin-sensible strains and a mean MIC of 5,5 micrograms/ml against methicillin-resistant strains.
