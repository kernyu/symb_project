Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of 90 strains of Neisseria meningitidis were determined by a plate dilution technique that employed twofold changes in concentrations of sulfadiazine. The geometric mean of three MIC determinations on each strain was correlated with inhibition zones produced by a 300-mug sulfathiazole disc. The linear relationship between the logarithm of the geometric mean MIC values and the zone diameters was highly significant. Strains were separated into sensitive and resistant populations by both test procedures. Quantitative criteria for interpreting the sensitivity of a strain by the disc test were established.
