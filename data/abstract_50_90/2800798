Experimental typhoid intoxication in white mice leads to the inhibition of microsomal oxidation in the liver, which is manifested by the prolongation of hexenal-induced sleep and a decrease in the toxic action of parathion. Phenobarbital, capable of inducing oxidases with mixed function (OMF), enhances the process of the detoxification of endotoxin injected into the animals, which is manifested by the increase of its LD50. Soluble levomycetin succinate, widely used for the treatment of typhoid-paratyphoid infections, is a powerful inhibitor of OMF (as shown by the hexenal test). Benzonal, the analog of phenobarbital, removes the inhibitory effect of the antibiotic. Experimental studies carried out in the course of this investigation make it possible to substantiate the clinical trial of these preparations (OMF inducers) used in the complex therapy of typhoid-paratyphoid infections for the stimulation of natural detoxification mechanisms of the body. Benzonal is the preparation of choice for use in clinical practice.
