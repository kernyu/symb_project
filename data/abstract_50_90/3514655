Imipenem is a member of a new class of highly potent beta-lactam antibiotics, carbapenems, with a very broad antibacterial spectrum. This study was undertaken to determine tentative interpretive criteria for in vitro susceptibility testing with 10-micrograms imipenem disks. A careful examination of the zone diameters and the corresponding MICs for 489 clinical isolates by regression-line analysis and the error rate-bounded classification scheme suggested the following guidelines: greater than or equal to 16 mm with an MIC correlate of less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml for susceptible, 14 to 15 mm (8 micrograms/ml) for moderately susceptible, and less than or equal to 13 mm (greater than or equal to 16 micrograms/ml) for resistant. Lack of cross-resistance between imipenem and broad-spectrum cephalosporins such as cefotaxime and ceftazidime argues against their use as class disks to predict in vitro susceptibility of bacterial species to carbapenems.
