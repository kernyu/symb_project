In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, methyl methanesulphonate and diepoxybutane produced efficiently lethal, as well as mutagenic, damage in nuclear DNA. However, in the same conditions, these agents did not induce cytoplasmic petite mutations and poorly induced point mutations (resistance to erythromycin and chloramphenicol) in mitochondrial DNA. Possible reasons for these differences are discussed.
