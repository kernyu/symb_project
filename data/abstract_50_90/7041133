We have identified the "prostatic antibacterial factor," responsible for the antibacterial activity of normal prostatic fluid as free zinc. It appears as if the bactericidal activity of the EPS is related to the amount of zinc present in the fluid and may play a role in the natural resistance of the male urinary tract to infection. In addition, the determination of the zinc content of the expressed prostatic secretion may be a useful test in diagnosing patients with chronic bacterial prostatitis or those who are likely to be susceptible to prostatitis. The factors responsible for the marked decrease of zinc in the prostatic fluid of patients with bacterial prostatitis and methods of altering the zinc level in the fluid as a possible means of eradicating chronic bacterial prostatitis or increasing the resistance of the patient to the disease are important questions requiring further study.
