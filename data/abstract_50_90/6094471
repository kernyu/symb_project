The nucleotide sequence of the central part of Tn10 has been determined from the rightmost HindIII site to IS10R. This sequence contains two open reading frames with opposite polarity. The in vivo transcription start points in this sequence have been determined by S1 mapping. These results define one minor and two major promoters. The transcription starts of the two major promoters are only 18 base pairs apart, and the transcripts show different polarity and overlap by 18 base pairs. The nucleotide sequence reveals two regions with palindromic symmetry which may serve as operators. Their possible involvement in the regulation of transcription of both genes is discussed. Taken together these results allow for a maximal coding capacity of 138 amino acids directed toward IS10R and 197 amino acids directed toward tetA. The possible function of these gene products is discussed. The accompanying article (Braus et al., J. Bacteriol. 160:504-509, 1984) presents evidence that these genes are expressed.
