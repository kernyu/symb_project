Cases with infections of urinary tracts were divided into 3 groups of the simple infections, and complicated infections without indwelling of catheter, and complicated infections with indwelling of catheter. Susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Proteus spp., Citrobacter spp., Enterobacter spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Serratia marcescens which were isolated from patients with these infections were determined. There was no tendency of decline in the susceptibilities of E. coli isolated from the patients with simple urinary tract infections (UTI). Susceptibilities of E. coli isolated from the patients with complicated UTI without and with indwelling of catheter to cephem antibiotics of the third generation were examined. The susceptibility of E. coli strains isolated from patients with complicated UTI without and with indwelling of catheter remained the same. More specifically, cefmenoxime (CMX) at a concentration of less than 0.10 microgram/ml inhibited the growth of E. coli isolated from cases without: with catheter at 74.1%: 78.3% in 1982, 75.4%: 73.3% in 1983, and 81.3%: 84.8% in 1984. Also, ceftizoxime (CZX) at a concentration of less than 0.10 microgram/ml inhibited the growth at 83.3%: 95.7% in 1982, 89.2%: 86.7% in 1983, and 91.7%: 97.0% in 1984. Latamoxef (LMOX) at less than 0.10 microgram/ml inhibited the growth at 59.3%: 43.5% in 1982, 47.7%: 40.0% in 1983, and 47.9%: 42.4% in 1984. The antibacterial effect of penicillin against Klebsiella spp. was found to be poor, while those of oral cephem antibiotics, cephalexin (CEX), cefaclor (CCL), and cefazolin (CEZ) which is the cephem antibiotics of the so-called first generation and cefotiam (CTM) among other cephem antibiotics of the so-called second generation were relatively good. A study of susceptibilities of Klebsiella spp. isolated from patients with complicated UTI without and with indwelling of catheter revealed inhibition of growth by CTM at a concentration of 0.39 microgram/ml at 84.0%: 75.9% in 1982, 70.6%: 75.0% in 1983, and 95.8%: 77.8% in 1984. Cefmetazole (CMZ) at a concentration of 0.39 microgram/ml showed a relatively lower rate of growth inhibition of Klebsiella spp., while at 0.78 microgram/ml it inhibited the growth at 88.0%: 72.4% in 1982, 52.9%: 50.0% in 1983, and 70.8%: 66.7% in 1984. The antibacterial effects of both CTM and CMZ against Klebsiella spp. isolated from patients with indwelling of catheter were found to be poor, and some of the bacterial strains showed a MIC over than 100 micrograms/ml.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
