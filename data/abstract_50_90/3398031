Death rates have been determined for staphylococcal strains dried on cotton blanket material and stored at room temperature in the dark and in the light. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains that produced a golden pigment and had a wide distribution within the hospital survived for longer periods than MRSA strains that produced little pigment and had a restricted local distribution. Death rates of methicillin-sensitive strains of S. aureus at day 7 were similar to those of the general epidemic MRSA strains, and there was no significant difference between the death rates at day 7 of the local epidemic MRSA strains and the coagulase-negative strains.
