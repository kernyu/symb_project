From 1981 to 1983, 1998 vaginal samples have been microbiologically examined in Abidjan. The average age was 23. Pathogen agents take often the place of normal lactobacillus flora. The presence of most of the microbian germs (Enterobacteriaceae, Neisseriae, Trichomonas, Corynehactery) was not increased by the pregnant state. But yeast and Candida albicans in particular, were found significantly more frequent in pregnant women. Candida albicans, serotype B, was, by far, the most frequently discovered. It has offered a real resistance against 5 fluorocytosin, as it can be observed in Europe. In vitro, ketoconazole appeared less efficient than econazole. On the contrary, nystatin and amphotericin B presented a great and constant activity against all yeasts of Candida genus.
