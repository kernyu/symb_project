The antibacterial agent olaquindox (2-[N-(2-Hydroxy-ethyl)carbamoyl]-3-methyl-quinoxalin-1,4-dioxide) given in tap water at daily doses of 0.2 to 0.5 mg exerts beneficial effects on the body weight decrease and survival of gamma-irradiated mice. Beneficial effects are achieved especially by the postradiation administration of olaquindox. It is presumed that the mechanisms of the therapeutic effects of olaquindox are connected with its action on the composition of intestinal flora of mice.
