Salmonella paratyphi B is a pathogenic agent causing outbreaks and keeping epidemiologic importance. The classical treatment of this disease is made by ampicillin, chloramphenicol, and co-trimoxazole in resistant strain. The resistant strains tends to cause a treatment problem. We report treatment and antibiogram results of 48 patients exactly diagnosed as paratyphi B infection by clinic and laboratory evaluation. These patients came to pediatric clinic of Erzincan state Hospital from Erzincan town and its backgrounds and had ages between 3 months and 5 years. All isolates were resistant to ampicillin, chloramphenicol and cotrimoxazole but usually sensitive to 3. generation cephalosporins (Cefotaxime had greatest sensitivity ratio with 79.1%) and amikacin.
