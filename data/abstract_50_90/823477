Tobramycin is a new aminoglycoside antibiotic with pharmacological similarities to gentamicin. Eleven of 15 patients with a severe or complicated gram-negative urinary tract infection were cured by treatment with a five day course of tobramycin. No side effects were noted. This drug should prove beneficial for the treatment of severe gram-negative sepsis and promises to be particularly valuable for infections due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa and organisms resistant to gentamicin.
