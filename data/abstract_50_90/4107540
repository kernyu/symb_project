The release of the ribonucleic acid (RNA)-containing phage MS2 from Escherichia coli is accompanied by cellular lysis at 37 C, whereas at 30 C phage are released from intact cells. Chloramphenicol or rifampin prevents the release of progeny phage particles at both temperatures. Neither drug causes an immediate cessation of phage release and after inhibition of protein synthesis by chloramphenicol phage release proceeds for about 17 min at 37 C and about 35 min at 30 C. Rifampin does not inhibit phage release from mutant cells possessing a rifampin-resistant deoxyribonucleic acid-dependent RNA polymerase. The results indicate that a short-lived host-controlled protein(s) is essential for the release of RNA phage particles at both temperatures.
