The microbiological and clinico-therapeutic efficacy and safety of ceftriaxone were compared with those of cefotaxime in an open randomized trial. Fifty-four adult hospitalized patients (37 males and 17 females) suffering from either acute bronchopneumonia (19) or acute exacerbations of chronic bronchopneumonia (35) have been investigated. Four patients were withdrawn from the trial. Underlying diseases were present in 41 patients. Ceftriaxone was administered at a once-a-day dose of either 1 or 2 g (in 13 and 14 patients, respectively) and cefotaxime at a 2 g twice daily dosing regimen (27 patients), both antibiotics being given for 7-12 days. In the ceftriaxone group, 15 out of the 27 patients were cured (55%) and 9 had a favourable clinical response for a total satisfactory response rate of 88%. The causative pathogen was eliminated in 18 (66%) patients. The results obtained in the cefotaxime group did not differ significantly, but 2 patients were excluded from the study because of in vitro resistance of the causative pathogen isolated. Both drugs were well tolerated: no relevant laboratory changes were registered. The results indicate that ceftriaxone at a dosage of 2 or 1 g daily is at least as effective as cefotaxime given daily at a dosage of 4 g in the treatment of severe lower respiratory tract infections.
