Fundamental and clinical studies have been performed on the BRL 25000 granules (combination of amoxicillin (AMPC) and potassium clavulanate (CVA) in 2: 1 ratio) in the pediatric field. In bacteriological studies a potentiated antibacterial activity of BRL 25000 was recognized against AMPC-resistant and beta-lactamase producing clinical isolates. The pharmacokinetics of the BRL 25000 granules were studied at dose levels from 10 to 20 mg/kg. The peak serum concentrations of AMPC and CVA achieved approximately 1 hour after dosing were 4.29-9.55 micrograms/ml and 3.87-4.78 micrograms/ml, respectively. The serum half-life was found to be 0.90-1.31 hours for AMPC and 1.01-1.22 hours for CVA. Six-hour urinary excretion rates were 29.5-62.6% for AMPC and 12.6-37.9% for CVA. In the clinical studies, the BRL 25000 granules were administered to 36 pediatric patients (15 with upper and lower respiratory tract infections, 10 with urinary tract infections and 11 with skin or soft tissue infections, etc.) at dose levels of 30-50 mg/kg/day. Clinical results in all cases were excellent or good. In particular, good bacterial and clinical effects were obtained against infections caused by beta-lactamase producing AMPC-resistant strains except E. cloacae 1 strain. No adverse reactions or abnormal laboratory findings were recognized in any patient.
