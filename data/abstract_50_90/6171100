The effect of human leukocyte interferon on reproduction of poliomyelitis virus in MIO cells resistant to this virus (MIOr) and sensitive MIO cells was studied. Interferon was shown to exert a short-time protective effect in the sensitive cells and to induce virus reproduction in the resistant cells. It is suggested that poliomyelitis virus reproduction in the resistant cells is due to activation of lysosomal enzyme, cathepsin D, in this system.
