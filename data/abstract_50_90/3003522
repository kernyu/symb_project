The composite transposon Tn2672 is a derivative of the Tn3-related transposon Tn902 whose bla gene providing ampicillin resistance had been inactivated by the insertion of the IS1-flanked multiple drug resistance transposon Tn2671. Most ampicillin resistant revertants of Tn2672 are due to precise excision of Tn2671. However, a rare Bla+ revertant which still retains all the previously acquired drug resistance markers was isolated. On this revertant, the 5' part of the split bla gene on Tn2672 has converted to an intact, active bla gene, and the entire Tn902 is structurally restored. In contrast, the adjacent IS1b element belonging to Tn2671 has its terminal 142 base pairs deleted. Despite of this rearrangement, the split 3' part of bla and its adjacent sequences have remained unchanged. Models are presented to explain the observed DNA rearrangements, and their similarity with gene conversion events is discussed.
