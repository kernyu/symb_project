Foremost aim of therapy is the preservation of the patient's life and conversion of pulmonary tuberculosis to "negative". Chemotherapy is performed with the combination of two to four drugs. INH and RMP are the most important components of all regimens of chemotherapy. The duration of therapy usually is 9 months, treatment more than 18 months should be the exception. The sole dispense of tuberculostatic drugs is recommended only for chemoprevention and chemoprophylaxis.
