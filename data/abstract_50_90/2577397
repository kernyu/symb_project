Rifampin shows unique antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus epidermidis biofilms, although in the in vitro situation rifampin resistance emerges rapidly by the selection of preexisting resistant mutants present in a small number in any large bacterial population. Fresh peritoneal dialysis solution is synergistic with rifampin suppressing rifampin resisters. The antimicrobial properties of rifampin are affected by heparin and protamine in entirely different directions. Heparin blocks the action of rifampin whereas protamine is synergistic producing a total bactericidal outcome. Protamine, when combined with heparin, unexpectedly did not influence the ability of heparin to antagonize rifampin. The mechanisms involved are unknown. The results are discussed in terms of known characteristics of the drugs and of the biofilm surface.
