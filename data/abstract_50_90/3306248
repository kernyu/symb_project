Since 1983, primary resistance of M. leprae to DDS and rifampicin has been evaluated in new cases of lepromatous leprosy observed in the Cap-Verde region in Senegal. Out of the 13 strains isolated, 10 (77%) have been found resistant to DDS, 7 at low level, 2 at intermediate level, 1 at high level; all of them have been found sensible to rifampicin. Similar results have been obtained with 57 strains isolated from patients not yet treated coming from different geographical areas, seeing that 37, i.e. 65%, were resistant to DDS, 27 at low level, 5 at intermediate level and 5 at high level; all of them were sensible to rifampicin. Level of resistance to DDS is very different in case of acquired resistance. In 69 lepromatous patients treated for more than 5 years and showing a relapse, M. leprae was 62 times, i.e. 90%, resistant to DDS, 6 times at low level, 21 at intermediate level and 35 at high level; in addition, 13 times M. leprae was resistant to rifampicin. In order to avoid and to solve problems set by resistance of M. leprae to antibiotics, strict application of polychemotherapy of leprosy is compulsory.
