Spontaneous fleroxacin-resistant mutants of Escherichia coli K-12 were isolated at a frequency of 10(-10) to 10(-11) mutants per CFU plated. All mutants exhibited quinolone-resistant replicative DNA biosynthesis, and 4 of 11 mutants also had decreased amounts of OmpF or OmpC porin. None of the mutants had changes solely in porin proteins.
