During 1985 Staphylococcus aureus was isolated from blood cultures of 74 patients at Tygerberg Hospital who were suffering from serious illness compatible with systemic spread of the organism. Twenty-six isolates (35%) were community-acquired and none were methicillin-resistant, while 48 were hospital-acquired of which 23 (48%) were methicillin-resistant. Methicillin resistance appears to be a problem confined to hospital isolates of S. aureus.
