Comparisons have been made of cell surface glycoproteins, concanavalin A agglutinability, and cloning efficiencies in liquid media of ICR 2A (haploid frog cells), ICR 2A M (three cloned populations of haploid frog cells resistant to 5 microgram per ml of the polyene antibiotic mediocidin), and ICR 2A M/MV cells (five cloned populations of morphologically variant haploid frog cells produced by exposure of the parental cells to the combined effects of mediocidin and an RNA mammalian virus, Mengo virus). Independently isolated ICR 2A M/MV clones exhibited altered cell surface glycoproteins, increased concanavalin A agglutinability, and enhanced cloning efficiency in liquid media when compared with ICR 2A parental cells. In contrast, ICR 2A M cells had properties similar to ICR 2A cells, with the exception of the former's increased resistance to mediocidin. The differences in properties between ICR 2A M/MV and ICR 2A cells suggest that alterations resembling transformation have occurred in ICR 2A M/MV cells as a consequence of combined treatment with mediocidin and Mengo virus.
