Smith, Rodney F. (University of Maryland, Baltimore), Donald E. Shay, and Norman J. Doorenbos. Antimicrobial action of nitrogen-containing steroids. J. Bacteriol. 85:1295-1299. 1963.-A new group of 16 synthetic nitrogen-containing steroids have been tested against a variety of microorganisms for antimicrobial properties. The gradient plate screening method, serial dilution, and dry weight techniques were used in the studies. The organisms tested consisted of 14 gram-negative bacteria, 10 gram-positive bacteria, 2 actinomycetes, 7 yeasts, and 8 molds. Inhibitory properties were found to be specific and potent in four compounds, with inhibitory concentrations as low as 0.37 mug/ml. Three of the active steroids are 4-aza cholestanes and one is a 4-nor-3,5-secocholestane amide. Sensitivity to the compounds was greatest in the gram-positive bacteria, followed by the yeasts and molds. The gram-negative bacteria were not inhibited. All 16 steroids interfered to some extent with pigmentation in Serratia marcescens but not with pigment production in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In a few instances, some of the molds were stimulated by the steroids at a concentration of 250 mug/ml.
