Staphylococcus epidermidis strain BM2641, isolated from a patient, was resistant to penicillin G, methicillin, aminoglycosides, chloramphenicol, macrolide, lincosamide and streptogramin B-type (MLS) antibiotics, and to high levels of fosmycin. Resistance to forsfomycin and/or to MLS was lost at low frequencies either spontaneously or after curing with novobiocin. The plasmid DNA from BM2641 and its cured derivatives was purified, analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis and transferred to a nitrocellulose sheet. Comparative analysis of the resistance phenotypes with the plasmid content of the strains indicated that fosfomycin and MLS resistance were encoded by plasmids pIP1842 (2.5 kb) and pIP1843 (2.6 kb), respectively. Southern hybridization with a probe specific for gene fosA of Serratia marcescens showed that the fosfomycin resistance determinant in Staphylococcus is not homologous to that of Gram-negative bacteria.
