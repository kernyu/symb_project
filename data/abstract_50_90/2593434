From 333 patients who underwent transurethral prostatectomy between May 1983 and April 1987, 123 strains of bacteria were isolated before surgery. Although all of the cocci which were sensitive to the used antimicrobials disappeared after surgery, significant difference was not observed between the disappearance rates of sensitive and non-sensitive gram-negative bacilli (disappearance rates were 86.4% and 77.8%). About two-third (34/57) of postoperative bacteria were those not isolated before surgery and patients with preoperatively infected urine had more chance than patients with sterile urine to develop infection by bacteria which was not pre-operatively detected. Precise preoperative condition is not known at the time of surgery and the sensitivity of preoperatively reported bacteria is, although important, not a sufficient information. We can only guess bacteria which might become apparent after prostatectomy.
