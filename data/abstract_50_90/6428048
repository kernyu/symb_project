Young men with uncomplicated gonococcal urethritis were treated with 1 gram of cefonicid given intramuscularly plus 1 gram of probenecid by mouth. Of 53 evaluable patients, 33 (62%) had penicillinase-producing Neisseria gonorrhoeae. All but one of these patients were cured. All men who had penicillin-sensitive infections were cured. Cefonicid was highly effective in the treatment of both penicillin-sensitive and penicillin-resistant N gonorrhoeae. Other than moderate pain at the site of injection, there were no adverse side effects. Cefonicid can be added to the group of newer cephalosporins that are effective in the treatment of gonococcal urethritis caused by either penicillin-sensitive or penicillin-resistant strains.
