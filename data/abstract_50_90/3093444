Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains, 1285 in total, were isolated from hospitalized children in the period 1981-1984. Serotypes 011 and 06 and nontypable strains were the most frequently identified. 44.6% of serotype 011 strains and between 12.4 and 37.7% of other serotypes were resistant to gentamicin, or carbenicillin, or both agents. The aminoglycosides with the highest activity against P. aeruginosa isolates were amikacin and netilmicin. Among the seven beta-lactam antibiotics tested the most active were cefsulodin, piperacillin and azlocillin.
