The hyperresistance to 4-nitroquinoline-N-oxide (4-NQO) and formaldehyde (FA) of yeast strains transformed with the multi-copy plasmids pAR172 and pAR184, respectively, is due to the two genes, SNQ and SFA, which are present on these plasmids. Restriction analysis revealed the maximal size of SFA as 2.7 kb and of SNQ as 2.2 kb, including transcription control elements. The presence of the smallest 2.7 kb subclone carrying SFA increased hyperresistance to formaldehyde fivefold over that of the original pAR184 isolate. No such increase in hyperresistance to 4-NQO was seen with the smaller subclones of the pAR172 isolate. Disruption of the SFA gene led to a threefold increase in sensitivity to FA as compared with the wild type. Expression of gene SNQ introduced on a multi-copy vector into haploid yeast mutants rad2, rad3, and snm1 did not complement these mutations that block excision repair.
