In the antibacterial chemotherapy in patients with chronic renal diseases several principles should be considered. Highly nephrotoxic or ototoxic antibiotics are not to be used in patients with chronic renal failure. The dosage ought to be reduced adequately to the degree of damage of renal function. The degree of reduction of renal function is to be evaluated by estimation of endogenous creatinine clearance or by estimation of serum creatinine level. The first dose of an antibacterial drug ought to be the same as in persons with good renal function. Additional doses should be reduced or the interval between the doses prolonged. It is necessary to monitor kidney function and possible side effects.
