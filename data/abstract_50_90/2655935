The effects of nine different tubulin-binding substances and of one actin-binding compound, cytochalasin B, upon the intraerythrocytic development of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum were investigated in vitro. From the data obtained, plasmodial tubulins seem to be quite different from the mammalian proteins on the molecular level. Tubulozole-T, a substance which is inactive in mammalian systems, appears to be a promising novel antimalarial drug.
