To a total of 31 patients (18 in- and 13 out-patients) having respiratory infections, we administered ofloxacin (OFLX) orally at a daily dose of 300 to 600 mg and examined its clinical effect. The clinical effect in the 31 cases was as good as 83.9%. Among these cases, 6 cases showed Pseudomonas aeruginosa, thereby indicating the effective rate of OFLX at 50%. In the present examination, we experienced cases in which OFLX-resistant P. aeruginosa appeared in the cases of long-term administration of OFLX. Therefore, our clinic carried out the sensitivity test of P. aeruginosa against OFLX, gentamicin (GM) and imipenem (IPM) in 1987, using clinically-segregated strains of P. aeruginosa obtained by sputum tests. The sensitive strains, which were 100% sensitive to OFLX, GM, IPM respectively in 1985, showed, in segregated strains in 1987, sensitivity of OFLX 57.1%, GM 85.7% and IPM 100%, thus indicating the high resistance-acquiring frequency of P. aeruginosa against OFLX.
