Flomoxef (FMOX, 6315-S) was given intravenously to 21 children with the following acute bacterial infections; 10 cases of bronchopneumonia, 3 cases each of purulent lymphadenitis and urinary tract infection, 2 cases of staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome and 1 case each of peritonsillar abscess, pyothorax and purulent meningitis. Good clinical responses were obtained in 18 out of 21 patients, and bacteriologically, all of the 17 isolated strains were eradicated. No side effect was observed except for 1 case with soft stool and 2 cases of eosinophilia. From the above clinical results, it is apparent that FMOX is a useful antibiotic for treating pediatric patients with various bacterial infections.
