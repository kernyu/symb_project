The study of the staphylococcal microflora of the tonsils in chronic tonsillitis patients revealed a high degree of variability in respect to its sensitivity to different antibiotics and the level of its agglutination by blood serum. The lesser part of the patients showed the presence of staphylococcal clones agglutinated by highly diluted serum and resistant to antibiotics suppressing the main part of the microbial population. The appearance of such clones in the microbial population is supposed to be the reason for the development of antibiotic-resistant population.
