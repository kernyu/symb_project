Staphylococcus simulans biovar staphylolyticus, the lysostaphin-producing organism, secretes a staphylolytic endopeptidase (EC 3.4.99.17) that is encoded on plasmid pACK1. Susceptibility of pACK1-cured strains to lysis by endopeptidase established that resistance to this enzyme is not an inherent property of the organism but rather is encoded on this dispensable plasmid. Furthermore, the enzyme is not an autolysin that is essential for cell wall synthesis because strains lacking the endopeptidase gene grew normally.
