In the oral cavities of BALB/c mice, microbial population levels are regulated by multifactorial processes. Factors include the production of inhibitory substances and the exchange of genetic material. In this work, 371 isolates from different sites (saliva, tongue, teeth, and mucosa) of the oral cavities of BALB/c mice were screened for resistance to antibiotics and antimicrobial activity. Antibiotic-resistant strains represented 25% of the total flora. Among the predominant species, all the S. faecalis isolates showed multiresistance, and 23% of the Lactobacillus murinus isolates and 15% of the Staphylococcus aureus were resistant to at least one antibiotic. Resistance to aminoglycosides (neomycin, streptomycin, kanamycin, and gentamicin) was most frequently encountered. In S. faecalis, high levels of resistance were recorded to neomycin and streptomycin but not to gentamicin or kanamycin. Macrolides (M), lincosamides (L), streptogramin B (S), tetracycline (Tc), and chloramphenicol (Cm) resistance was also present in multiresistance patterns, especially among S. faecalis isolates. Hemolytic (Hly+) streptococci were less resistant to MLS, Tc, and Cm than were non-hemolytic (Hly-) isolates. Resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics was detected only among staphylococci and with a low prevalence (4%). The frequencies of strains producing antimicrobial substances against the indicator strains (S. mutans LG-1, S. sanguis Ny 101, and A. viscosus Ny 1) were high for L. murinus (76%) and S. faecalis (57% for Hly- and 90% for Hly+), but low for S. aureus (7%). These results indicate that the indigenous oral flora could interfere with colonization by allochthonous micro-organisms and that resistance patterns should be taken into account for the elimination of the oral indigenous flora by antibiotic treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
