In the southern Netherlands, Branhamella catarrhalis can be cultured from sputum in more than 20% of patients with purulent lower respiratory tract infections and approximately 40% of strains produce beta-lactamase. With increasing resistance to co-trimoxazole (10%) and erythromycin (6%) this produces many treatment problems, particularly in general practice. Recent results in the treatment of B. catarrhalis respiratory infections with newer antimicrobial agents and new combinations of beta-lactamase inhibitors are presented. Cefotaxime and ceftazidime are predictably effective but, considering their cost and the fact that they require parenteral administration, they need to be reserved for strict indications.
