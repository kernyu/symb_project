All aminoglycoside-resistant gram-negative bacilli isolated during 1 year at a community hospital were tested for in vitro sensitivity to cefotaxime, moxalactam, cefoperazone, and piperacillin. The majority of Enterobacteriaceae were susceptible to all four antibiotics. Cefoperazone and piperacillin were the most active for pseudomonas aeruginosa, and activity for other nonfermentative gram-negative bacilli was variable.
