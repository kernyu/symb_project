A suitable model for the study of the interaction of the aging process and prolonged treatment with ethanol is described. Animals were given 15% ethanol in the drinking water for up to 25 months. There was little disruption in the growth of the animals. Ethanol treatment resulted in a number of neurological and morphological changes some of which persisted throughout the treatment period. Both young and old animals displayed metabolic tolerance by the criteria of resistance to ethanol-induced hypothermia and increased metabolism of [14C]ethanol. The regime used has proved useful in the study of the interaction of ethanol and aging in the rat.
