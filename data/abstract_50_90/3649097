A retrospective survey was undertaken to determine the incidence of chloramphenicol-resistant Salmonella typhi in Durban, South Africa. Of the 3313 strains tested over a 7 year period 20 (0.6%) showed intermediate resistance to chloramphenicol and 19 (0.6%) were fully resistant. Resistance to chloramphenicol was found to fluctuate over the period studied (0-2%). Resistance to ampicillin/amoxycillin was encountered less frequently (0-0.9%). For the present we would still recommend chloramphenicol or amoxycillin for the initial treatment of typhoid fever in this region.
