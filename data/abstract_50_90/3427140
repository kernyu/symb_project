This study addresses the problem of antibiotic resistance in adhesive, biomaterial-centred infections. It is suggested that this anionic, extracapsular, polysaccharide slime produced by bacteria protects them from antibiotics and sequesters critical ions from the surface of biomaterials. Biofilm-enclosed bacteria on the surface of stainless steel substrata in a test chamber were challenged with incremental levels of tobramycin. In this setting, the minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal level of tobramycin for Staphylococcus epidermis were well above normal.
