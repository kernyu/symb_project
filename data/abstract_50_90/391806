Plasmid pKM101 enhances the frequency of spontaneous and ultraviolet light-induced mutations in Escherichia coli and protects the cells against the lethal effects of ultraviolet irradiation. By analyzing reversion patterns of defined trpA alleles, we showed that pKM101 caused all types of spontaneous base-pair substitution mutations with the possible exception of guanine . cytosine leads to adenine. thymine transitions. Neither insertion nor deletion frameshift mutations were enhanced. Transversions were more strongly enhanced than transitions, and adenine . thymine base pairs appeared more susceptible to pKM101 mutator activity than guanine . cytosine base pairs. In addition, there were effects from neighboring base pairs and genetic background that influenced the mutator activity of pKM101.
