We studied the plasmid and antibiotic resistance characteristics of 35 strains of Enterobacteriaceae recovered from faecal specimens of children with diarrhoea in Central General Hospital, Bandung, Indonesia. Twenty three Escherichia coli, three Providencia, three Proteus, three Klebsiella, two Enterobacter and one Citrobacter were examined. All strains were multiply resistant, many carrying six to nine antibiotic resistances. Most of these resistances were transferable to a laboratory E. coli strain and were carried on large-sized plasmids. All recently-described tetracycline resistance determinants (Classes A----D) were represented; the most common was the Class B, or TN10 type. The TEM-1 beta-lactamase was detected in 17 out of 21 ampicillin-resistant strains examined. The OXA-1, PSE-1, and SHV-1 enzymes were also found. Of 23 plasmids tested, all could be classified into one of eight different incompatibility groups: IncFII, IncN, IncB, IncF1, IncI1, IncI2, IncH2 and IncT. These studies demonstrate the existence of large multiresistant transferable plasmids representing common incompatibility groups and bearing common tetracycline and ampicillin resistance determinants in enteric strains isolated from children hospitalized in Indonesia.
