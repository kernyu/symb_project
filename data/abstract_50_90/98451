The in vitro activity of gentamicin, tobramycin, sisomicin, netilmicin, amikacin, kanamycin and streptomycin was tested simultaneously by the agar dilution method against 584 clinical isolates of gram-negative bacilli that were resistant to gentamicin and/or tobramycin. About half of the gentamicin-resistant Pseudomonas were susceptible to tobramycin but cross-resistance was virtually complete between gentamicin and tobramycin for Enterobacteriaceae. Sisomicin was much more active than gentamicin against Klebsiella, Escherichia and Citrobacter species. Only 18.9%, 27.4% and 27.9% of Klebsiella, Enterobacter and Serratia respectively were resistant to netilmicin. Amikacin was the most effective aminoglycoside with an overall resistance of 15.6%. Kanamycin was effective against 40% of Proteus and Providencia species. Surprisingly, more than half of Klebsiella and Enterobacter species and 85.3% of Serratia species were susceptible to streptomycin.
