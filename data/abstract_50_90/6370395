In this work, the authors studied in vitro potential interactions between bacteria and antibiotics. Colistin and ampicillin were introduced to ampicillin-resistant Escherichia coli and ampicillin activity was measured. Two layers of agar media were used. The lower layer contained E. coli and colistin. The superficial layer was sown with indicating bacteria (ampicillin-sensitive Proteus mirabilis). Ampicillin activity was evaluated on the upper layer with impregnated disks. By this technique, it was ascertained that ampicillin degradation increased with colistin concentration. In this case, colistin may favour interactions of intracellular beta-lactamases on ampicillin.
