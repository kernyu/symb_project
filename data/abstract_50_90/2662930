Bacteroides were detected in pus and bioptates of the majority of 125 patients with purulent and purulent septic infections of various localization. In 90 per cent of the subjects the bacteroides were detected in association with aerobes, facultative and obligate anaerobic bacteria. The species of the bacteroides and concomitant microflora isolated from the cases with different diseases were defined by endogenic sources of the microbial contamination. Sensitivity of 112 bacteroide strains to antimicrobial agents was tested. Chloramphenicol, clindamycin, metronidazole, cefotaxime and heliomycin proved to be the most efficient. Efficacy of heliomycin was detected in hamsters with experimental bacteroide infection in the buccal sac. Thorough bacteriological examination is required for rational chemotherapy of bacteroide infections.
