The antibacterial activity of 33 substituted and unsubstituted seven-member ring tropones and tropolones was examined on 14 reference strains representing Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. It was shown that the chemical character and position of the substituent plays a distinct role in the biological activity of investigated compounds. Depending on the substituent the antibacterial effect may be either increased or diminished. C-1 thio and C-2 nitro derivatives of tropone are significantly more active than tropone. The dibenzotropone derivatives display no antibacterial activity. Hydroxymethyl derivatives of tropolone are more active than tropolone, while hydroxy-, isopropyl-, methyl- as well as tropolone acetates are equipotent.
