The bacterial flora of 99 cases of abscesses following Bothrops snakebite were analysed. They corresponded to 61.1% of all snakebite abscesses observed in 1030 patients attending the Hospital de Doencas Tropicais de Goiania in Goias, Brazil, from January 1984 to April 1988. An exsudate sample of each abscess was examined by Gram stain, culture and susceptibility tests. The Gram negative bacillis, Morganella morganii, Escherichia coli and Providencia sp were the most frequent bacterias isolated. They were identified in 44.4%, 20.2% and 13.1% of the samples respectively. This flora was similar to those described in snake mouth and venom by other researchers. Based on the results of the susceptibility tests the authors suggested the use of chloramphenicol for the treatment of those abscesses which do not respond to simple drainage.
