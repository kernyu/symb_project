Selection was made in Escherichia coli K-12 recA hosts carrying plasmid R6K for ampicillin hyperresistance. Twenty-two selected strains were found to carry mutant plasmids, which, from electron microscopy and restriction enzyme analysis, were concluded to arise by a duplication of transposon Tn2660, which confers ampicillin resistance, in all cases the duplicate transposon being in an inverted orientation with respect to the resident Tn2660. A mutant of R6K, pSJC301, which was temperature sensitive for ampicillin resistance was produced by in vitro hydroxylamine treatment of R6K deoxyribonucleic acid. A plasmid hybrid, pSJC102, was constructed by cloning the EcoRI R6K fragment carrying the wild-type beta-lactamase gene into the EcoRI site of ColE1. pSJC301 and pSJC102 were transformed into the same recA host strain to form a stable biplasmid strain. Ampicillin-hyperresistant mutants were selected from this strain and screened for plasmids with a duplication of transposon Tn2660, which occurred with equal frequency in either pSJC301 or pSJC102; of 12 characterized, all were inverse repeats of the resident transposon. All six Tn2660 inserts into pSJC301 determined temperature-sensitive ampicillin resistance, and all six inserts into pSJC102 determined wild-type ampicillin resistance, from which it was inferred that transposition of a duplicate Tn2660 occurs predominantly as an intramolecular event, at least in the multicopy R6K plasmid. In all 28 insertion mutants of R6K, there was an inversion of the deoxyribonucleic acid between the two transposons, whereas in only one of six insertion mutants of pSJC102, inversion had occurred. These results are discussed in terms of current models of transposition.
