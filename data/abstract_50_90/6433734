Although enterococcus is well recognized as a pathogen in endocarditis, urinary tract infections, and biliary sepsis, its role in other forms of intraabdominal sepsis remains controversial. Antibiotics that lack activity against enterococcus can often be employed successfully in intraabdominal infections, even when enterococci are present as part of the polymicrobial flora. Furthermore, the enterococcus rarely emerges as a blood borne pathogen in such a setting. Breakthrough enterococcal septicemia may occur, however, in the immunodepressed host, particularly in the face of broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy not specific for enterococcus. Like infections with other opportunistic pathogens, enterococcal sepsis under these circumstances carries a high mortality. Specific antienterococcal drug therapy may be indicated as an adjunct to surgical management in selected patients with intraabdominal sepsis.
