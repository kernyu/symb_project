Resistance to virginiamycin S (VS, a type B synergimycin) has been mapped in Bacillus subtilis. Transduction experiments with phage PBS1 indicate that the gene for virginiamycin S resistance (VSR) is cotransduced with the markers pur A16 (20%) and cys A14 (46-49%). Transformation experiments indicate that the gene for virginiamycin S resistance maps between the markers for elongation factor G and erythromycin resistance, and is therefore located within the gene cluster of ribosomal proteins.
