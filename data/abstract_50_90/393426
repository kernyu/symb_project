The present study was conducted to evaluate the application of the in vitro microtechnique system in determining the response of chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium falciparum to mefloquine.Using isolates of P. falciparum from Boa Vista, Brazil, and Villavicencio, Colombia, mefloquine was more than 7.7, 7.1, 7.1, and 6.4 times more effective than chloroquine in vitro at the ED(90), ED(95), ED(99), and ED(99.9) levels, respectively.
