Adverse effects, drug-drug interactions and bacterial resistance to the new quinolone antimicrobial agents are reviewed. Clinical adverse effects are reported to occur in 5-10% of patients, and include primarily gastrointestinal disturbances, central nervous system toxicity and rash. Laboratory abnormalities are reported to occur in 5-12% of patients, and include mild reversible elevations of transaminases. Quinolones are not recommended in persons whose bone growth is incomplete or in pregnant or nursing women because cartilage toxicity has been observed in juvenile beagles. Drug-drug interactions may occur between quinolones and theophylline, caffeine, and magnesium- or aluminium-containing compounds such as antacids and sucralfate. Bacterial resistance occurs by chromosomal mutations which alter the target enzyme DNA gyrase or decrease drug accumulation. Emergence of resistance during therapy is uncommon to date but can be problematic in infections with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Staphylococcus aureus and other bacteria for which the therapeutic index may be low. In summary, quinolones thus far have been well tolerated, but more experience is needed to determine the exact nature and extent of adverse effects and emergence of bacterial resistance.
