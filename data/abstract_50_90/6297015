61 patients, male and female, with uncomplicated acute gonorrhea were given a single dose of 300 mg rosoxacin (2 capsules). 52 patients only completed clinical and laboratory controls. The drop-out rate for follow-up examinations was 14.8%. 98% of patients were cured. One patient failed to respond to treatment, and six had reinfection seven days later at follow-up control. Three of these were again treated with rosoxacin and cured. Among the side-effects, which were recorded in 24.4% of patients, dizziness was most prevalent (18.1%). Rosoxacin is particularly valuable in gonorrhea, given the single oral dose, the absence of resistance and the high percentage of efficacy.
