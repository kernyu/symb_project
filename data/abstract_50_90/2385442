A laboratory model of acquired immunity to human hookworm is described. Significant resistance to challenge infection with Ancylostoma ceylanicum was elicited in mature DSN hamsters. The serum and mucosal antibody responses were investigated in both quantitative and qualitative terms and changes associated with immunity were identified. Marked differences in numbers of mast and goblet cells in the small intestine were also recorded and related to the immune status of the host.
