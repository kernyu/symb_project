This work studies 51 strains of Pseudomonas putida, isolated from clinical specimens (17) and hospital environment (34). Identification is performed by study of 41 physiologica and biochemical characters and 78 nutritional characters. According to the two biotypes A and B, described by Stanier, Palleroni and Doudoroff, these 51 strains can be grouped as follows: 48 have typical characters of biotype A, widely predominant, 3 can be distinguished from biotype A only by their auxanogram and included in biotype B. Antibiogram pattern of P. putida shows two salient features: resistant to carbenicillin and sensitivity to kanamycin. Among 17 human isolates, only 4 have likely pathogenic significance. By intraperitoneal challenge in mice, one half of strains is avirulent, other strains have a very low virulence (LD50: from 2,2 to 5 X 10(8) viable cells). There is no relationship between experimental virulence and bacterial sources.
