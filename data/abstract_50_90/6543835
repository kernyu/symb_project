One hundred and ninety-three children with bacillary dysentery were admitted to the "Assaf Harofeh Hospital" during the years 1975-1980. Generalized convulsions were observed in 37 (19.2%) children. The incidence of seizures was significantly higher in children whose age ranged between 1 and 6 years when compared to those below or above this age range. Convulsions were not observed when fever was below 38 degrees C, however, higher fever was not associated with a parallel increase in their incidence. Temperature above 38 degrees C was less common in infants compared to older children. These findings suggest that convulsions in shigellosis do not differ from simple febrile convulsions in respect to age, sex, presence and degree of fever. The incidence of resistance to either ampicillin or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was similar in all the various shigella strains isolated in our population.
