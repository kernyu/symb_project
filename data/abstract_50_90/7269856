The biochemical and serological examination of 31 strains of Levinea malonatica isolated from faeces, urine, sputum, wound infections and blood showed no correlation of bio- or serovars with the origin of the strains. Serological cross-reactions between O-antigens of L. malonatica and certain Salmonella, Shigella and Yersinia enterocolitica serovars were analysed. They are low-titred and seem to be of minor importance. Sensitivity testing revealed the resistance of L. malonatica against penicillin, ampicillin and carbenicillin.
