Fosfomycin, an antibiotic from a new class of substances, has a bactericidal action against a broad spectrum of gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. The efficacy of fosfomycin in urinary tract infections was investigated with a dose of 15 g/day. 52 urological patients with obstructive and non-obstructive infections of the urinary tract were accepted for the study. The therapeutic success was convincing: 91% of the pathogens were eliminated from the urine, the urine was free from organisms in 84% of the patients after the treatment. 93% were clinically symptomless. The effects against Pseudomonas was very good: 8 of 9 strains present were eliminated. Unpleasant gastrointestinal side effects occurred which were dependent on the rate of infusion and usually became tolerable at a slower rate.
