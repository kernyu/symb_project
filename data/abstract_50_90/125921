Modern chemotherapy postulates highly active drugs without unwanted side effects. In the treatment of gonorrhea spectinomycin meets even the strictest requirements: maximal obtainable cure rates, no masking of concomitant syphilitic infections, and excellent tolerance. In animal experiments no sensitizing effect of spectinomycin was found even when maximation procedures were applied. Anaphylactoid activity of spectinomycin is low, as has been documented by personal investigational series.
