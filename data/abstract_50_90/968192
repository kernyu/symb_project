The anthelmintic efficacy of fenbendazole (methyl 5-(phenylthio)-2-benzimidazole carbamate) was tested in sheep against standardised strains of Hcaemonchus contortus and Trichostrongylus colubriformis, known to be resistant to thiabendazole (LD90 for thiabendazole against H ontortus was 200 mg/kg bodyweight and against T colubriformis was 150 mg/kg). Fenbendazole at dose rates of 5, 10 and 20 mg/kg per os reduced total worm counts in H contortus infected sheep by 66, 90 and 100 per cent respectively, with similar reductions recorded for worm egg outputs. For the thiabendazole resistant strain of T colubriformis, fenbendazole reduced total worm counts in infected sheep by 4, 44 (40-48), 79 (75-83), 96 and 100 per cent at dose rates of 5, 10, 20, 40 and 80 mg/kg per os. Significant suppression of worm-egg production by thiabendazole resistant T colubriformis was obtained with fenbendazole at dose levels of 5 mg/kg and above. The implications of these results are discussed in the light of the increasing occurrence of strains of trichostrongylid nematodes resistant to currently available benzimidazole anthelmintics.
