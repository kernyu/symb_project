The authors studied the effect of essentiale on the clinical course, state of central hemodynamics and content of prostaglandins in the blood and urine of patients with hypertensive disease. Age of the patients: middle--from 45 to 59 years and elderly--from 60 to 74 years. It is suggested that the hypotensive effect of essentiale is caused by a reduction of the total peripheral resistance while its humoral basis is an increase of the depressor potential of plasma and renal prostaglandins. Age-related differences in the response to essentiale treatment consist mostly in the effect on the clinical symptoms, arterial pressure, prostaglandins in the blood and urine differing in the elderly as compared with medium-aged patients.
