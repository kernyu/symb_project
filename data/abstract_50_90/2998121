Plasmids of 31 E. coli strains coding for the TEM-1 beta-lactamase were analysed for the molecular basis of this enzyme. In transposition experiments we could demonstrate that only 50% of the plasmids were able to transpose their ampicillin-resistance gene. Two of the non-transposing structures were further examined. The 8.1 kb plasmid pBP738 contained Tn3 having suffered a point mutation within the transposase gene that could be complemented by an intact transposase. The 79 kb plasmid pBP749 carried a TEM-1 coding sequence, but the homology with Tn3 was limited to 1.18 kb.
