A comparative study was conducted on the severity and course of postoperative urinary infections in prostatic adenoma patients with preoperative bacteriuria and patients without infection. In both groups urinary infections showed a similar tendency to resolve, whereas a significant increase of polyresistant bacterial strains was noted in patients with preoperative bacteriuria. A comparison of 100 patients who had undergone transurethral resection and 100 patients who had undergone prostatectomy showed that severity and course of the postoperative urinary tract infection did not differ.
