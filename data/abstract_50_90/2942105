The MICs and MBCs of ciprofloxacin were determined for clinical isolates of antibiotic-resistant aerobic bacteria. Decreased susceptibility to ciprofloxacin of cefotaxime- and amikacin-resistant Serratia marcescens and amikacin-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains were noted. The data suggest that ciprofloxacin susceptibility should be carefully monitored in treating patients with hospital-acquired bacterial infections.
