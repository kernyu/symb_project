Eight isolates of micrococci from the bloodstream of six patients obtained under circumstances suggesting a pathogenic role were studied in detail. The organisms were remarkably uniform in cultural, biochemical and antibiotic-susceptibility characters. All strains showed high resistance to methicillin and hydrolysed arginine. The characters found did not correspond with those of any hitherto described species, but were closest to Micrococcus lylae.
