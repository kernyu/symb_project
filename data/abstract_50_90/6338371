Toxic and mutagenic activities of formaldehyde were studied in Salmonella typhimurium strain TM677, using forward mutation to 8-azaguanine (8-AG) resistance both in the absence and in the presence of Aroclor-induced rat-liver postmitochondrial supernatant (PMS). The results showed that formaldehyde was toxic and mutagenic to the bacteria in both systems, but toxicity and mutagenicity were reduced in the presence of PMS. The minimum concentration required to induce toxicity and mutagenicity was 0.17 mM in the absence of PMS and 0.33 mM in the presence of PMS.
