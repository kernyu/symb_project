This study was undertaken to evaluate the number of the immunoglobulin producing cells in the lamina propria of the small intestine by immunocytochemical techniques, using peroxidase-antiperoxidase (PAP) complex in normacid patients with CSBS. 25 patients were studied including 13 patients with bacterial overgrowth, where the bacterial concentration was higher than 10(4) colony forming units/ml, and 12 subjects with normal bacterial concentration, served as control. The patients with CSBS were treated with antibiotics according to the antibiotic resistance. After treatment the luminal bacterial concentrations was lower than 10(4) cfu/ml in 7 of 13 patients (CSBS I. group). In 6 patients the bacterial concentration remained high (CSBS II. group). The immunoglobulin producing cells were determined in biopsy specimens taken from the lower part of duodenum. The number of the IgA and IgM producing immunocytes was significantly decreased only in the CSBS II. group. Our results show that temporary immunological alterations may play an important role in the mechanism of the recurrent CSBS.
