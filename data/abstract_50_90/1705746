Coxiella burnetii antigens stimulate the defence against growth of hepatoma 22a cells. The antigen-stimulated mice survived longer, they considerably later developed palpable tumours and showed a retarded tumour growth. The enhanced resistance to tumour growth may be explained by at least 2 interrelated phenomena; namely by the induction of interferon-like activity and an increased NK cell activity.
