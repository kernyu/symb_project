Activities of four new Cephalosporins (Cephamandole, Cefoxitin, Cefuroxime, Cefotaxime) and of some of the most used Aminoglycosidic antibiotics were tested against Gram-negative bacteria (Pseudomonas and some Enterobacteriaceae) that are often formed to be multi-resistant. 266 strains were observed. An evident increase or resistance to Aminoglycosidic antibiotics was confirmed, while the new Cephalosporins demonstrated an remarkable activity against the majority of resistant bacteria, often superior to Aminoglycosidics.
