A physical map of the streptococcal macrolides, lincomycin, and streptogramin B (MLS) resistance plasmid pDB101 was constructed using six different restriction endonucleases. Ten recognition sites were found for HindIII, seven for HindII, eight for HaeII, and one each for EcoRI, HpaII, and KpnI. The localization of the restriction cleavage sites was determined by double and triple digestions of the plasmid DNA or sequential digestions of partial cleavage products and isolated restriction fragments, and all sites were aligned with a single EcoRI reference site. Plasmid pDB101 meets all requirements essential for a potential molecular cloning vehicle in streptococci; i.e., single restriction sites, a MLS selection marker, and a multiple plasmid copy number. The vector plasmid described here makes it possible to clone selectively any fragment of DNA cleaved with EcoRI, HpaII, or KpnI, or since the sites are close to each other in map position, any combination of two of these restriction enzymes.
