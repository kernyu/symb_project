A total of 75 strains (including 5 reference strains) of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, B. cereus, B. circulans, B. licheniformis, B. megaterium, B. pumilus, B. sphaericus, B. subtilis, and B. thuringiensis and 36 species-unidentified Bacillus strains were surveyed for plasmids by cesium chloride-ethidium bromide equilibrium centrifugation of cell lysates in a study of antibiotic resistance in host cells. Of the 111 strains, 13 (including 3 reference strains) were found to harbor plasmids, and 5 of the 13 showed antibiotic resistance. This antibiotic resistance appeared not to be due to the plasmids, however, because the trait was not cured by cultivation of cells in nutrient medium containing ethidium bromide (1 microgram/ml), sodium dodecyl sulfate (0.2 micrograms/ml), or novobiocin (1 microgram/ml), except in one strain, in which kanamycin and streptomycin resistances were cured by novobiocin. One strain of B. amyloliquefaciens, S294, was found to harbor a plasmid, pFTB14, which differed from the plasmid species of classes 1 to 6 in B. subtilis and B. amyloliquefaciens, as determined by restriction analysis and DNA contour length determination. However, in DNA-DNA hybridization on a filter after Southern blotting from an agarose gel, the pFTB14 DNA hybridized with plasmids of classes 1 to 5. Three strains of B. thuringiensis each carried at least 4 to 11 plasmid species, whereas no plasmids were detected in four strains of B. cereus, which, in relation to B. thuringiensis, is closely related taxonomically and has highly homologous DNA sequences. The plasmid DNAs prepared from species other than B. subtilis and B. amyloliquefaciens did not hybridize with that of pFTB14.
