Campylobacter fetus subsp. jejuni was recovered as the sole bacterial pathogen from 31% of 0- to 8-month-old children with acute gastroenteritis and from 5% of asymptomatic children (P less than 0.05). In children 8 to 24 months old, the respective recovery rates were 38 and 40%. With the exception of one case of simultaneous bacteremia, the clinical course of the symptomatic infection was benign and rarely lasted more than a week. The isolates were sensitive to most commonly used antibiotics. Several isolates shared antigenic determinants with C. fetus subsp. intestinalis. A bacteriophage specific for C. fetus subsp. jejuni lysed 73% of the strains. Several phage-resistant isolates carried a phage that lysed the stock strain of C. fetus subsp. jejuni (NADC 917).
