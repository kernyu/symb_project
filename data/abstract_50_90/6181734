Penicillin-resistant and penicillin-tolerant mutants have been isolated from group A streptococci mutagenized by ethyl methane sulfonate. The resistant mutants had an elevated minimal growth inhibitory concentration for benzylpenicillin (minimal inhibitory concentration, 0.2 microgram/ml, as compared with the minimal inhibitory concentration of 0.006 microgram/ml in the penicillin-susceptible parent strain); they also had an abnormal cellular morphology and showed altered penicillin-binding proteins. Penicillin-tolerant mutants were killed more slowly than were the parental cells during treatment with penicillin; they had virtually unchanged minimal inhibitory concentration values for penicillin and normal cellular morphology and penicillin-binding proteins.
