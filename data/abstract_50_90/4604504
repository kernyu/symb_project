A number of minority recombinant and parental types from a heterosexual cross were analyzed for the omega allele they carry. It was found that recombinant progeny can be omega(-), that minority parental types among the progeny can be omega(+) rather than omega(-), and, finally, that certain of the results suggest that the omega locus may not be at the proximal end of the mitochondrial genetic map (Bolotin et al., 1971; Grivell et al., 1973) but rather may lie between the [cap1-r/cap-s] and [ery1-r/ery-s] loci.
