Resistance of 1280 strains of Salmonella of various serological types isolated in the Zakarpatskaya region within 1967-1976 was studied with respect to benzylpenicillin, streptomycin tetracycline, levomycetin, monomycin, neomycin, erythromycin and oleandomycin. An Increase in the resistance of Salmonella to streptomycin, tetracycline, levomycetin, monomycin and neomycin was shown. During the last years Salmonellae carrying 4-8 resistance determinants were spreading in the region. Among S. typhimurium strains with 7-8 resistance determinants predominated (58.8 per cent). The cases of salmonollosis were mainly due to these strains.
