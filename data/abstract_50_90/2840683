The DNA of 21 chloramphenicol-resistant plasmid-free streptococci was tested for sequence homology with the genes encoding chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (cat) of the staphylococcal plasmids pC194 and pC221. Homology to the cat gene of pC194 was detected in 11 strains, including the 8 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae examined, and homology to cat of pC221 was found in 3 strains. The DNA of 7 strains did not detectably hybridize with either probe.
