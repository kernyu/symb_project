Synthetic analogs of (2'-5')oligo(A) were assayed for endonuclease activation in cell extracts and for inhibition of protein synthesis in intact cells. The analogs are triadenylates: (i) methylated in the terminal 3'-OH; (ii) methylated at all three 3'-OH groups; (iii) with different numbers of phosphate groups at the 5' terminus or with a methylene group between the beta- and gamma-phosphate. Only 5'-phosphorylated monomethylated analogs activate an endonuclease in cell extracts and are powerful inhibitors of protein synthesis in intact cells. The analogs with only one 5'-terminal phosphate may require addition of another phosphate for activity since the kinase inhibitor 2-aminopurine prevents endonuclease activation by this compound but not by the di- and triphosphate-terminated triadenylates. These results suggest that two terminal phosphates and one or two free 3'-OH are required for endonuclease activation and inhibition of protein synthesis. The monomethylated analogs are more active than (2'-5')pppA3 because of their resistance to degradation by cellular enzymes. Accordingly, the monomethylated analogs cause a prolonged inhibition of protein synthesis in human fibroblasts treated with nanomolar concentrations of these compounds.
