THE REASONS FOR THE RECURRENCE OF URINARY TRACT INFECTION AFTER ANTIBIOTIC THERAPY ARE: (1) underlying renal disease, (2) the short female urethra, and (3) bacterial resistance. Quantitative bacteriuria rather than pyuria is important in diagnosis. Radiologic changes are late manifestations of pyelonephritis. Treatment of lower urinary tract infection requires a high urinary drug level, whereas renal infection requires high tissue levels. Urinary pH adjustment increases antibiotic effectiveness. Therapy for recurrent infection should be continued for at least six months.
