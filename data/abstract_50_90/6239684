The immune status of C57BL/6J mice implanted with Lewis T241 fibrosarcoma or Lewis lung (LL) carcinoma was investigated on days 14 and 28 after implantation. Splenic lymphocyte responses were assessed in mitogen (Con A, LPS) mixed lymphocyte culture (MLC), natural killer (NK), graft-vs-host (GVH), and interleukin production assays. Except for NK-cell cytotoxicity, all other immunologic parameters were either comparable to those in medium-implanted controls or augmented. NK cytotoxicity was reduced in both tumor-bearing groups on day 28. The provision of NK potentiation therapy (beta-interferon, polyinosinic: polycytidylic acid) to T241 mice under various treatment conditions did not have any significant effect on lung metastasis or survival. The results of this study do not support the thesis that T241- or LL-bearing C57BL/6J mice are generally immunosuppressed. Indeed, when immune functions were assessed on the basis of total splenic activity, each of the measured immunologic parameters was substantially greater in animals with tumors than without. Further it seems improbable, considering the magnitude of the NK-cell defect in T241 mice on days 14 and 28 after implantation and the absence of a therapeutic response to NK-cell stimulants, that NK-cell cytotoxicity is intrinsically associated with resistance to tumor progression in this model.
