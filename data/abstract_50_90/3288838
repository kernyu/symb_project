Wild-type (clone 707) Friend murine leukaemia cells were compared with two ara-C-resistant subclones in terms of sensitivity to cell killing and mutagenesis to 6-thioguanine resistance following treatment with ethyl methane sulphonate, methyl methane sulphonate and UV irradiation. The ara-C-resistant subclones, 707DKE and 707DK48, had respective deoxycytidine kinase activities of 6.7 and 5.4% the values found in wild-type cells. No clear pattern of altered sensitivity to cell killing or mutagenesis emerged between the wild-type cells and the ara-C-resistant subclones. These results do not provide evidence for a role of deoxycytidine kinase in determining sensitivity to mutagenic agents in the Friend cell line.
