Famine and the manifestations of acute hunger that result are an unnecessary disgrace to our global society and serious in their political, economic, and social consequences. Probably more damaging is the chronic undernutrition that afflicts such a large proportion of the populations of developing countries and the hidden hungers of iron deficiency, avitaminosis A, and iodine deficiency disorders that are enormously widespread. Famine in the modern world is almost invariably superimposed on chronic undernutrition that is not solved with emergency relief. Adaptation to this undernutrition requires a reduction in physical activity needed for household and community improvement as well as work output. Iron deficiency interferes with cognitive performance, resistance to infection, and capacity for work. Other nutrient deficiencies add to the damage to the individual and society. Prevention of famine and hunger is not primarily a technological issue, but a moral, political, and social one.
