Thirty-five strains of Torulopsis glabrata were tested by a tube dilution method for their susceptibility to amphotericin B, 5-fluorocytosine, and clotrimazole (Bay 5097). Amphotericin B was the most active in vitro, inhibiting all strains at a concentration of 1 mug/ml and killing all strains at 2 mug/ml. 5-Fluorocytosine inhibited over 80% of strains at 0.24 mug/ml, but three strains required >/=7.8 mug/ml for killing. A concentration of 2 mug of clotrimazole per ml inhibited less than 50% of strains, and 8 mug/ml killed only 10% of strains. Most strains of T. glabrata were killed by therapeutically achievable concentrations of amphotericin B and 5-fluorocytosine, but not clotrimazole.
