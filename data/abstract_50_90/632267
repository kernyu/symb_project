Characterization of purified DNA-dependent RNA polymerase (EC 2.7.7.6) of Caulobacter crescentus, strain CB15 has led to the conclusion that this enzyme catalyzes poly(A) synthesis in the absence of template. Poly(A) synthetase activity co-purifies with both holoenzyme and core polymerase on DNA-cellulose columns, and core polymerase purified to 98% homogeneity by glycerol gradient centrifugation is still capable of catalyzing poly(A) polymerization. Both RNA synthesis and poly(A) polymerization activities are sensitive to rifampicin. In addition, RNA polymerase purified from partially rifampicin-sensitive mutants exhibits the same partial sensitivity in vitro to the drug in the synthesis of RNA and poly(A). The enzyme used in these studies was prepared by a simple method which allows a high yield of pure RNA polymerase from large batches of exponential cells. The procedure includes high speed centrifugation of cell extracts, DEAE-cellulose column, DNA-affinity chromatography, and low salt glycerol gradient centrifugation. Holoenzyme can be resolved into core and sigma subunit by either DNA-cellulose chromatography or glycerol gradient centrifugation, and the latter step allows recovery of pure sigma factor.
