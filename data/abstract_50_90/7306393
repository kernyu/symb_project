Multi-resistant S. aureus, have been isolated from wounds of patients in the burn unit of the University of Parma. The strains were resistant to penicillin (85%), methicillin (30%), gentamycin (63%), rifampicin (41%), cotrimoxazole (38%), lincomycin (39%), tetracycline (73%), erythromycin (66%) and cephaloridine (11%). The spread of these strains has been monitored by the analysis of the antibiograms and the lysotypes and in few cases some strains were also found in other wards of the Hospital. All of these had some correlation with the burns unit. Medical and technical staff of this ward was found to be carrier of multi-resistant S. aureus in 46% of the cases and that feature is supposed to be the most important in the epidemiology of S. aureus in this Hospital.
