Two new antibiotics, structurally related to cephalothin, have been given the generic names cephaloglycin and cephaloridine. Cephaloglycin is the dipolar ion of 7-(d-alpha-aminophenylacetamido)-cephalosporanic acid. Cephaloridine is 7-[alpha-(2-thiophene)acetamido]-3-(1-pyridylmethyl)-3-cephem-4-carboxylic acid betaine. These new compounds were evaluated simultaneously. The broad spectrum of activity observed in vitro and in vivo with both antibiotics, the good oral absorption obtained with cephaloglycin, and the stability of cephaloridine are emphasized. The data suggest that both antibiotics merit clinical trial in humans.
