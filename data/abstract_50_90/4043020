In order to determine the mutagenic specificity of mutagenic and carcinogenic agents in mammalian cells, a reversion system capable of distinguishing between frameshift mutations and various kinds of base pair substitutions would be useful. We report here a method for the isolation and characterization of HGPRT- Chinese hamster V79 cell mutants that might form the basis for such a system. Two mutants of different specificity have been partially characterized. DEW-1, isolated following N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) treatment, is revertible by the base pair substitution mutagens MNNG and ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS), but not by frameshift mutagens. DSW-3, isolated following ICR-191 treatment, is specifically reverted by frameshift mutagens, but not by EMS or MNNG. With the further characterization of these and other mutants, it should be feasible to determine not only whether an agent is mutagenic in V79 cells, but also to determine the type(s) of mutation(s) it produces.
