Quinine was compared with a 9-phenanthrene methanol (WR33063) and a 4-quinoline methanol (WR30090) for the treatment of 207 patients with falciparum malaria in Southeast Thailand. Quinine eradicated parasitaemia (average 70 hours) more rapidly than either WR30090 (72 hours) or WR33063 (77 hours). But WR33063 had a higher cure rate (92%) than WR30090 (86%) or quinine (85%). The mean duration of fever and of parasitaemia were combined with the failure rate to form an arbitrary efficacy index. Using this concept WR33063 was the most effective drug. The recrudescence rate correlated with the degree and duration of parasitaemia and with the duration of fever. WR33063 was the least toxic drug. Side effects associated with WR30090 appeared to be headache, backache and urticaria. Quinine was the most toxic drug. All 3 drugs were inconvenient in having to be administered every 8 hours for 6 days. One patient did not respond to oral quinine but did respond to an intravenous quinine infusion (IVQ). A "Medication Ward Round" was perfected during the study and comprised sequential history, drug administration, physical examination, dose notation and patient observation. Falciparum nephrosis was diagnosed in one patient.
