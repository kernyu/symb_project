A DNA fragment of the broad host range plasmid RP4 carrying the cis-acting DNA recognition site for conjugative DNA transfer between bacterial cells (Mobsite) was cloned into the kanamycin-neomycin resistance transposon Tn5. Using conventional transposon mutagenesis techniques the new transposon, called Tn5-Mob, can easily be inserted into the host DNA of gram-negative bacteria. A host replicon carrying Tn5-Mob is then mobilizable into any other gram-negative species if the transfer functions of plasmid RP4 are provided in trans. The potential of Tn5-Mob was demonstrated by mobilizing Rhizobium meliloti plasmids as well as the E. coli chromosome at high frequencies.
