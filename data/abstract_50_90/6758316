Studied was the sensitivity to chemotherapeutic agents of a total of 49 strains of Escherichia coli isolated from the various compartments of industrial pig-breeding complexes. It was found that most of the strains were sensitive, however, there were also strains that showed multi-drug resistance. Conjugation tests revealed that in 30.6 per cent of the cases such resistance was induced by conjugative R-plasmids. It was also found that the presence of R-plasmids among bacteria in the indifferent environment' at the pig-breeding complexes was of great importance for chemotherapeutic treatments in connection with the selective capacity of the preparations applied.
