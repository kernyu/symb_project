Hospital-acquired infection with strains of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) have considerably increased in recent years. In addition to being resistant to methicillin, these strains are resistant to practically all forms beta-lactams, aminoglycosides and many other antibiotics. There appears no cost-effective control and preventive measures for this common but also potentially life-threatening disease. Although not clearly presented, the overall cost for the treatment of patients infected with MRSA should be enormous. Can laboratory medicine (or clinical microbiology) contribute to this global medical problem? Multiple strains of MRSA circulate within a hospital and some strains are even localized within specific wards. These facts suggest yet undisclosed routes of transmission and/or foci of infection. Triumph over these versatile organisms may have to await the development of new antibiotics effective for MRSA.
