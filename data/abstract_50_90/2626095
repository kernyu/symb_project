In this study pus samples obtained during operation from 28 patients with brain abscess have been examined microbiologically. In three of the 28 patients the cultures were negative (10%) obligate anaerobic bacteria from 20 (80%) patients, microaerophilic bacteria from 2 (4%) patients, aerobic bacteria from 11 (44%) patients have been isolated. Among the 15 obligate bacteria and 2 microaerophilic bacteria, the highest resistance has been shown against tetracycline, among the 11 aerobic bacteria the highest resistance has been shown against Gentamicin and Tetracycline.
