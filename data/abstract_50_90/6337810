Two tourists from Kenya with falciparum malaria had an R1-resistance against chloroquine (WHO-extended field test, no in-vitro test). In addition, one of them was resistant against pyrimethamine-sulfadoxine (Fansidar), however sensitive against quinine and mefloquine. In a third tourist, from Tanzania, a diagnosis of chloroquine-resistance had been made too early and drug medication had been changed. These observations document the necessity of early species diagnosis. It is recommended to consider also in patients from East Africa the possibility of multiple resistances of falciparum malaria and to change medication if required.
