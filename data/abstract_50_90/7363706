The minimal inhibitory concentrations of 45 antimicrobial agents were determined for 13 strains of Bacteroides melaninogenicus. All the strains showed good susceptibility to those agents known to be active against anaerobic gram-negative rods, such as tetracyclines and lincomycins. The lowest MICs were observed with lincomycin, clindamycin, methacycline, doxycycline, minocycline, and erythromycin. As expected, aminoglycosides were only poorly active, also some strains showed clear resistance to penicillins, cephalosproins (including the newer ones), and nitroimidazoles.
