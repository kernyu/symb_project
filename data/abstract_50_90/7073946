Two cell lines, one sensitive and one resistant to the cytotoxic effects of cytosine arabinoside (AraC) were studied in vitro as a drug-resistance model. The sensitivity of these cell lines, to the effects of free and liposomally trapped AraC and AraCTP as well as empty liposomes alone and mixed with free drug, was studied. This was done by following the inhibition of [3H]-dT incorporation into cellular DNA during exposure to the various drugs and liposomes. Some of the liposomal-lipid compositions inhibited [3H]-dT incorporation at very low concentrations, which made them unsuitable for further study. Liposomes composed of a 7:2:1 molar ratio of phosphatidylcholine:cholesterol:phosphatidic acid were selected as a suitable non-inhibitory carrier. Sensitivity of the two cell lines to free AraC differed by 3 logs, when compared in the [3H]-dT-incorporation assay. The resistant cell line was studied further, and was found to be up to 2 logs more sensitive to AraCTP when given in liposomes than to either the free drug alone or mixed with empty liposomes. It appears from these studies that liposomes are able to help overcome drug resistance in this cell line in vitro.
