Authors have isolated and identified 229 strains from patients with typhoid syndrome . The bacteriology of each strain was studied. We have observed the extension of A (subtype Dakar) lysotype to Central Africa from West Africa. All the strains are resistant for G penicillin. Clinical features are quite the same as in mild countries, with a high incidence in children. The typhoid fever is frequent and precocious in CAR, where prophylaxis by vaccination is not usual.
