Thirty-nine patients with acute enteric fever received the fixed-dose oral combination of pivmecillinam/pivampicillin. Thirty-seven (95%) subjects responded satisfactorily. No relapses or persistent faecal excretion of salmonellae were seen in the 29 patients followed up for 2 to 19 weeks. The treatment was well tolerated, no side-effects being recorded. In vitro studies revealed a synergistic interaction between mecillinam and ampicillin against isolates of Salmonella paratyphi A.
