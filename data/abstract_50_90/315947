Cytotoxicity and membrane permeability alterations induced by the polyene macrolide antibiotics filipin (FIL) and pimaricin (PIM) have been compared in parental intraspecific and interspecific somatic cell hybrids. B82 (mouse) and B1 (hamster) cells were found to be more resistant than RAG (mouse) parental cells to both polyene macrolides as indicated by 24-hour survival, 72-hour viability, and growth rate. Analysis of both intraspecific and interspecific somatic cell hybrids indicated that polyene macrolide resistance was being expressed even in the presence of the polyene macrolide-sensitive (RAG) genome. Where one of the two parental cell types is relatively polyene macrolide resistant, the use of specific polyene macrolides may prove efficacious as half-selective agents in cell hybridization.
