A total of 455 streptococcal cultures from bovine intramammary infection in 72 herds were studied to determine their sensitivity to 17 antimicrobial agents. More than 90% of the cultures were sensitive to carbenicillin, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, and penicillin. Gentamicin, neomycin, nitrofurazone, polymyxin, and streptomycin were ineffective in the in vitro inhibition of streptococci.
