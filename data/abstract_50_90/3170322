An important reduction in the in vitro efficacy of spectinomycin and chloramphenicol was recorded between 1981 and 1986 against the causal agent of porcine pleuropneumonia Actinobacillus. Antimicrobial susceptibility tests were carried out by use of Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion technique on a total of 723 isolates of Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae. Results did not agree with those of other reports in which a constant susceptibility to any of the antimicrobial agents tested was reported with serotype 2 isolates. The ability to acquire drug resistance may differ from one serotype to another.
