The current circumstances associated with Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteremia are reviewed in 108 episodes to assess the impact of new antimicrobial drugs on this infection. Since 1961, Pseudomonas bacteremia has apparently become more frequent with proportional increases in middle-aged patients. The respiratory tract has become the major source of infection. Clinical features are not characteristic, but infected patients are almost uniformly severely ill before blood stream invasion occurs. The use of gentamicin, carbenicillin and colistin has not changed the outcome of Pseudomonas bacteremia. Although better than no antimicrobial treatment, these drugs cannot be shown to be superior to any other available antibiotics. A reassessment is needed to evaluate the relationship between the in vitro action and the effectiveness of antibiotics in the treatment of Pseudomonas infection and the use of gentamicin, carbenicillin and colistin in these bacteremias. In view of the poor results with antibiotics, investigation into immunologic prophylaxis and therapy is needed. At the present time, control of the patients' underlying disease contributes most towards assuring survival with Pseudomonas bacteremia.
