It was shown that the transcription initiation of the kanamycin resistance gene (the Km gene) from transposon Tn5 in E.coli HB101 strain can be provided by specific yeast sequences. To localize a region of the yeast DNA involved in transcription initiation, a number of hybrid plasmids containing promoterless part of the Km gene fused with DNA sequences from chromosome III of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae was constructed. Comparison of nucleotide sequences lying in the LTR of the yeast transposon Tyl-17 with the consensus bacterial promoter revealed strong similarities.
