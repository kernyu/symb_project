The mouse LA9 HQN-R11 cytochrome b mutant, in which the glycine residue at position 231 is replaced by aspartic acid, has increased resistance to all inhibitors of the Qn redox center. It is shown here that this single amino acid alteration has multiple and unexpectedly diverse effects upon the mitochondrial protonmotive bc1 complex. (1) The specific activities of both succinate- and ubiquinol-cytochrome c oxidoreductases in isolated mitochondria are reduced by approximately 65% in the mutant. The parallel reductions in both oxidoreductase activities are not compatible with simple Q pool kinetics for mitochondrial electron transport. (2) There is also a reduction in the relative concentration of cytochrome b in the mutant when calculated on the basis of mitochondrial protein; this decrease does not account for more than a small portion of the reduced catalytic fluxes. (3) The increased antimycin resistance of the mutant is lost upon solubilization by the detergent dodecyl maltoside of the bc1 complex from mitochondria. (4) In pre-steady-state assays of cytochrome b reduction by quinol, the mutant shows a reduced extent of reduction. It was observed in other experiments that there was less oxidant-induced extrareduction of cytochrome b in the mutant. These results could arise from a lowering of the midpoint potentials of both the cytochrome b-562 and cytochrome b-566 heme groups. Alternatively, these effects may reflect changes at the Qp and Qn quinone/quinol binding sites. (5) An unexplained observation for the mutant is the increased rate of cytochrome c1 reduction in the presence of myxothiazol. (6) These functional alterations in the LA9 HQN-R11 mutant are not accompanied by detectable changes in the spectral properties of the cytochrome b or c1 heme groups.
