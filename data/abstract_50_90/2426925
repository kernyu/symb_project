pC658: a plasmid determining resistance to chloramphenicol in the hospital strain of Staphylococcus aureus JM658 was transduced after irradiation of phage lysate with high doses of UV. The localization of determinants causing resistance to chloramphenicol in the obtained transductants was investigated by modified Arber's method and variants resistant to chloramphenicol, but suspected of absence of chloramphenicolase plasmid were selected. Additionally the absence of plasmid DNA was demonstrated in the selected strains. The possibility of plasmid and chromosomal localization of the same gene indicates its translocable nature. The obtained results suggests transposomal character of the genes determining resistance to chloramphenicol in the pC658 plasmid, occurring in the hospital strain of S. aureus.
