The mutagenic potential of the cytidine analog, 5-azacytidine (Aza Cyd), was tested at the thymidine kinase (TK) gene locus of L5178Y mouse lymphoma cells. 3-h exposure to as little as 20 ng/ml Aza Cyd yielded a substantial increase in TK-deficient L5178Y cells as measured by drug-induced resistance to trifluorothymidine (TFTres) 48 h later. This mutagenic effect was diminished up to 75% when Aza Cyd was tested in the presence of either enzymatically active or heat-denatured 9000 X g supernatant prepared from rat liver homogenate. The mutagenicity of Aza Cyd was also decreased in the presence of 1-5 X 10(-3) M thymidine and eliminated in the presence of greater than 1 X 10(-5) M cytidine. Two L5178Y TK-deficient cell lines had no selective survival advantage compared to TK-competent L5178Y cell stock when plated in soft-agar medium that contained Aza Cyd. Four other specific inhibitors of scheduled DNA synthesis in mammalian cells, deoxyadenosine, aphidicolin, 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine, and hydroxyurea were also L5178Y/TK mutagens. These data along with other published results suggest that chemicals known to disrupt nucleotide biosynthesis, alter deoxyribonucleotide pools, or directly inhibit DNA polymerase can cause stable, heritable increases in TFT resistance through mechanisms dependent upon altered replicative DNA synthesis, yet not necessarily dependent upon DNA incorporation or the binding of these mutagenic agents to nuclear DNA.
