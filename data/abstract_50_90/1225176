Sensitivity of 33 foreign and 10 native strains of Y. enterocolitica to tetracycline, aminoglycosides, penicillins, levomycetin and polymyxin was studied. All the strains proved to be resistant to penicillin, oxacillin and ampicillin: they produced penicillinase. The level of resistance to penicillin did not always correlate with penicillin activity. The ability of the native strains to acquire R-factor in vitro from Coli bacteria was shown.
