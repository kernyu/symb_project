Unilateral inspiratory and expiratory nasal resistance to airflow were measured in 35 subjects using active anterior rhinomanometry. No significant difference was found between inspiratory and expiratory resistance. Inhalation of a mixture of aromatics, camphor, menthol, oil of pine needles and methyl salicylate had no effect on inspiratory or expiratory nasal resistance. Factors influencing inspiratory and expiratory resistance and the actions of aromatics are discussed.
