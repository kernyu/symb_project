We studied the synergistic enhancement effects of two chemicals which are different in their mechanism of action on DNA in cells. The test chemicals used were ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) as an alkylating agent and cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C) as an analogue of cytidine. For determination of mutagenesis we measured the induction of resistance to 6-thioguanine (6-TG) in Chinese hamster V79 cells. EMS had a strong mutagenic effect on V79 cells, but for Ara-C the results were less clear. In this study, Ara-C had no detectable effect in inducing mutation up to a concentration of 5 X 10(-4) M. The mutation frequency of combined treatment with EMS and Ara-C was significantly higher than that obtained with EMS alone. These results indicate that Ara-C had an enhancing effect on mutations induced by EMS.
