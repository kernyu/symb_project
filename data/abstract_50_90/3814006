Coccidia were isolated from 99 broiler farms in 12 broiler-producing states and tested for sensitivity to contemporary anticoccidial drugs. The isolates usually comprised two or more species, including 92 Eimeria acervulina, 47 E. maxima, 28 E. tenella, and 10 E. brunetti. Based on intestinal-lesion-score reduction of 30% or more, 38% of isolates were resistant to monensin (110 ppm), 29% to salinomycin (60 ppm), 20% to nicarbazin (125 ppm), and 46% to amprolium + ethopabate (125 + 4 ppm). Isolates with 50% or greater reduction of lesion scores were considered sensitive. Thirty-three percent were sensitive to monensin, 53% to salinomycin, 67% to nicarbazin, and 39% to amprolium + ethopabate. Other isolates had intermediate response to drugs and were considered to have "reduced sensitivity." There was some evidence for incomplete cross resistance to the polyether, ionophorous products.
