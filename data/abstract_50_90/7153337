Because of the emergence of drug-resistant Klebsiella strains in many hospitals, the distribution of the serotypes was reexamined to determine whether there was any correlation between the serotype and the site of isolation from the body, the antimicrobial susceptibility pattern, or the place of acquisition of the organism (hospital or community). One hundred consecutive isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae from different patients were typed as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or greater than 6. Of these, 8 of 28 strains isolated from respiratory secretions were serotype 2 (9 typable strains), 6 of 24 wound isolates were serotype 3 (8 typable strains), and the urine isolates varied in their serotypes. Regardless of serotype, most strains appeared mucoid on blood and MacConkey agars. Twenty-six percent of the isolates were resistant to at least one antimicrobial agent. No correlation was found between the serotypes and the antibiotic resistance; however, strains isolated within 25 days of admission to the hospital from the community were all susceptible. It appears that although there may be a correlation between the serotype and isolation from some sites of the body, knowledge of the serotype of the organism cannot predict the antimicrobial susceptibility pattern. The clinician's choice of antibiotic therapy should depend largely on whether the Klebsiella strain was acquired by the patient in the community (0% resistant) or in the hospital (31% resistant).
