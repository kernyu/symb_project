Cross-resistance data for a group of nine acyclovir-resistant variants of herpes simplex virus type 1 are reported. These mutants, which express either altered thymidine kinase (TK) or DNA polymerase, were all derived from the same wild-type (wt) strain after exposure to acyclovir in tissue culture. Furthermore, all variants have pathogenic properties similar to the wt parental strain as assessed using mouse model systems (G. Darby, H.J. Field, and S.A. Salisbury, Nature (London) 289:81-83, 1981; B.A. Larder and G. Darby, Virology 146:262-271, 1985). Two groups of antiherpes compounds were used: those requiring activation by TK and those whose action is independent of that enzyme. The TK substrate-specificity mutants were generally resistant to the TK-activated drugs but showed wt susceptibility to phosphonoacetic acid, 9-beta-D-arabinofuranosyladenine, and aphidicolin. The DNA polymerase mutants were relatively susceptible to most TK-activated drugs, although two were resistant to 5-(trifluoromethyl)-2'-deoxyuridine. The polymerase mutants showed a more complex pattern of susceptibility, however, to those compounds whose mode of action is independent of TK. In general, these variants showed similar responses to phosphonoacetic acid, phosphonoformate, and 9-beta-D-arabinofuranosyladenine, a particular variant being either resistant, susceptible, or hypertensive to all three. The response of each variant to aphidicolin, however, appeared to be the inverse of its response to the other three drugs. The cross-resistance patterns are discussed, and their implications for combined or successive therapies are considered.
