Intestinal colonization by highly erythromycin-resistant members of the family Enterobacteriaceae was surveyed for 4 years in a hematology-oncology unit. Fifty-four of 555 patients (9.7%) were colonized, each with a different strain. The incidence of intestinal carriage was not correlated with erythromycin consumption in the ward but was strongly associated with individual exposure to erythromycin.
