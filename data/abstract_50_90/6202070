Between 1972 and 1981, 38 patients suffering from lung disease by atypical mycobacteria were admitted to our institute. 36 out of them were males and 2 females with an average age of 55 years. In 10 patients silicosis was present. The patients received chemotherapy at special combinations using Rifampicin, Ethambutol and one or two additional drugs. 2 patients could be healed by lung lobe resection. In 12 patients x-ray regression could be observed. In the remaining patients, stabilization of the lung lesions and sputum conversion--at least temporarily--could be obtained. Because of multiple drug resistance, the therapy of mycobacteriosis is complicated, and permanent conversion of sputum cannot always be obtained, especially in diseases caused by M. intracellulare-avium. Bacteriological relapses are to be expected in 30 to 40 percent.
