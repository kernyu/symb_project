The response of the free-living stages of Nippostrongylus brasiliensis, Nematospiroides dubius, Haemonchus contortus, Trichostrongylus colubriformis and Ostertagia ostertagi to a wide variety of antiparasitic agents in vitro was investigated. All the major broad spectrum veterinary anthelmintics showed good activity against each of these worms with EC50 values varying from about 0.0002 mg/l for certain benzimidazoles and ivermectin to about 6.5 mg/l for febantel. Of 22 known narrow spectrum anthelmintics useful only against H. contortus and/or helminths other than trichostrongyles, only 10% showed good activity at concentrations equal to or less than 10.0 mg/l. Further, only one of 15 antiprotozoal agents showed good activity in these tests at the 10.0 mg/l level. The screening test employing free-living Nippostrongylus brasiliensis was selected for an extended trial where the evaluation of 1400 miscellaneous organic chemicals was undertaken. Approximately 10% of these showed activity at concentrations equal to or less than 10.0 mg/l. It is concluded that in vitro screening tests employing the free-living stages of these five genera of nematodes afford simple yet effective means for selecting relevant compounds for further evaluation as possible leads to new broad spectrum anthelmintics for use in ruminants. However, tests using the free-living stages of these worms, including H. contortus, are unsuitable for detecting narrow spectrum 'specifics', e.g., for the treatment of haemonchiasis.
