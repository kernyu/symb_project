Two strains of gram-positive cocci highly resistant to vancomycin (MICs of 512 and 1,024 micrograms/ml) were isolated from blood cultures in two compromised patients. These organisms were identified as Leuconostoc spp. Leuconostoc spp. are gram-positive cocci found in vegetables and dairy products; they had not been isolated previously from clinical specimens. The susceptibility of eight Leuconostoc spp. strains, including the two clinical isolates, to 23 antimicrobial agents was determined.
