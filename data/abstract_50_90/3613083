A new parenteral cephalosporin antibiotic, cefuzonam (L-105, CZON), was evaluated for its safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics in children. Twenty-two cases of bacterial infections including pneumonia, lung abscess, sepsis, urinary tract infection and soft tissue infections were treated with CZON. Clinical effective rate was 95%. Serum half-lives of CZON were 1.04-1.33 hours in children with normal renal and hepatic functions. Significant depressions of the normal fecal flora were observed and diarrhea or loose stool was encountered in 7 of the 22 treated cases (32%).
