Seventy four cases of neonatal septicaemia seen at the University of Benin Teaching Hospital (UBTH) over a 3-year period were analysed. The incidence was 6.1 per 1,000 live births. Fifty five percent of the infants were low birth weight. The predisposing perinatal problems were asphyxia, prolonged rupture of membrane and peripartum maternal fever. E. coli and Staphylococcus aureus were the most important aetiologic pathogens; both of which were associated with a high mortality rate. The overall mortality rate was 41.5%. On the basis of the organisms isolated and their sensitivity patterns, it is suggested that the initial treatment for neonatal septicaemia should include cloxacillin and gentamycin.
