This report discusses the differences in enzymes of two populations of P. aeruginosa, one sensitive and the other resistant to carbenicillin, which were strains isolated from four patients with chronic urinary infections. These sensitive and resistant strains biosynthetize only one beta-lactamase which appears to be a cephalosporinase of the class Id of Richmond and Sykes (1973). In the four cases the bacterial resistance to carbenicillin does not involve a new beta-lactamase and is due to other factors.
