Of 117 strains of Azotobacter chroococcum, isolated from local soils the antibiotic resistance pattern to ten widely used antibiotics was determined by antibiotic disk and agar plate dilution method. Over 95% of the strains were resistant to 10 micrograms ml-1 concentration of ampicillin, chloramphenicol, erythromycin and tetracycline and 70% or more were resistant to kanamycin, nalidixic acid, rifampicin, streptomycin and trimethoprim. 1 to 8% of the strains showed resistance upto 400 micrograms ml-1 concentration of 5 antibiotics (ampicillin, chloramphenicol, kanamycin, streptomycin and tetracycline). The intrinsic resistance to the 10 antibiotics was generally high in Azotobacter chroococcum strains.
