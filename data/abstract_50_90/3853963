We tested 148 strains of clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus against fosfomycin alone and in combination with methicillin, cefamandole, gentamicin, trimethoprim, and vancomycin. Fosfomycin inhibited 90% of the 148 methicillin-resistant S. aureus strains at a concentration of 4 micrograms/ml. Synergism was observed in 97 strains (66%) with fosfomycin-cefamandole and in 69 strains (46%) with fosfomycin-methicillin. The combinations of fosfomycin with vancomycin, gentamicin, and trimethoprim were indifferent in most strains.
