An unusual species, Campylobacter laridis , belonging to the group of nalidixic acid resistant thermophilic Campylobacter species, was isolated from the blood of a 71-year-old man with multiple myeloma, hyperviscosity syndrome, and renal failure. The organism was first recognized in the laboratory by gram-stain reaction and resistance to nalidixic acid. The organism differs from C. jejuni and C. coli by its resistance to nalidixic acid, whereas anaerobic growth in the presence of trimethylamine N-oxide hydrochloride differentiates this organism from other Campylobacter species. Biochemical characterization and DNA homology studies confirmed the identity of this species as being C. laridis . To our knowledge, this is the first recorded case of bacteremia due to C. laridis in humans.
