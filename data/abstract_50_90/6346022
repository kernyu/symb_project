Citrobacter freundii and Klebsiella pneumoniae were concurrently isolated from a patient with a urinary tract infection. Transferable drug resistant plasmids were isolated from both strains, pMS434 and pMS435. These plasmids belonged to incompatibility group K and both carried genes governing resistance to various aminoglycoside antibiotics, i.e., kanamycin, gentamicin C complex, streptomycin, and 3',4'-dideoxykanamycin B, in addition to those governing resistance to sulfanilamide and ampicillin. They inactivated kanamycin, gentamicin C complex and 3',4'-dideoxykanamycin by adenylylation and kanamycin by phosphorylation. Electron microscopic observations disclosed that the molecular weights of the plasmids were about 67.8 megadaltons. These results indicated the similarity in genetic constitution of the two plasmids. This was the second isolation of incompatibility group K plasmids, following that reported by Hedges and Datta (Nature 234: 220-221, 1971).
