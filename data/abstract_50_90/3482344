The urinary antibacterial drugs enoxacin and norfloxacin were compared for efficacy and side effects in the treatment of lower urinary tract infections. Thirty-five patients received enoxacin and 25 received norfloxacin for one week. The antibacterial spectrum of enoxacin was noted to be better than that of norfloxacin, but both drugs performed well in clearing the infections caused by susceptible organisms. The incidence of side effects was higher with norfloxacin than with enoxacin.
