The results of the study on the antibiotic sensitivity of clinical strains of Ps. aeruginosa are presented. The strains were isolated from the clinical material of surgical patients with postoperative infections due to Ps. aeruginosa and chronic purulent infections of the lungs. For comparison 40 strains of Ps. aeruginosa isolated from the environment of the hospital were tested. The methods of agar diffusion and serial dilutions in liquid media were used for determination of the sensitivity. Polymyxin M, tobramycin, carbenicillin, gentamicin and amicacin were most active, 100, 99.1, 96, 95.5 and 95,1 per cent of the isolates being sensitive respectively. The results of the serial dilutions were comparable with those of the agar diffusion with respect to gentamicin and polmyxin M. The strains of Ps. aeruginosa isolated from the clinical material were more sensitive to gentamicin and carbenicillin (4.5 and 4 per cent of the resistant strains respectively) than those isolated from the environment (10 and 30 per cent of the resistant strains respectively). Sensitivity of the strains did not depend on the source of their isolation.
