Ability of an enzyme complex from Streptomyces recifensis var. lyticus 2435 to inactivate beta-lactam antibiotics was shown. Two lytic endopeptidases with beta-lactamase activity were isolated and identified as beta-lactamases of classes II and V according to the Richmond and Sykes classification system. The ability of the endopeptidases to hydrolyze the beta-lactam ring confirmed the absence of strict substrate specificity in them. Correlation between the capacity of the lytic endopeptidases for lysing staphylococcal cells and their capacity for inactivating beta-lactam antibiotics was observed.
