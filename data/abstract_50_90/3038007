Macrolides-lincosamides-streptogramin B (MLS) resistance is commonly found in Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci (22 and 45%, respectively, among isolates from three New Jersey hospitals). We have examined representative subsets of 107 MLS-resistant isolates for the molecular nature of the resistance determinant, the erm gene, by dot blot and Southern hybridization analysis. All of 35 S. aureus isolates examined and 39 of 42 coagulase-negative isolates examined were found to harbor the ermA or ermC evolutionary variant. Genes of the ermC class occurred exclusively on a small plasmid similar to or indistinguishable from one (pNE131) previously described in S. epidermidis. Genes of the ermA class occurred exclusively in the chromosome, and restriction patterns indicated that they were part of a transposon, Tn554, characteristic of the classical S. aureus ermA strain. Unlike S. aureus ermA strains examined previously, which harbor Tn554 at a single specific (primary) site, four of our S. aureus isolates had second inserts at different chromosomal sites. The majority of our coagulase-negative isolates had two or more inserts, neither of which occurred at the classical primary site and many of which differed from one another in location (as inferred from restriction patterns). Coagulase-negative staphylococci constitute a large reservoir of the ermA and ermC class of determinants, with clear potential for interspecies spread.
