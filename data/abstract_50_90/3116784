The tests commonly used for bacterial identification, especially in the field of microbial environmental analyses frequently do not provide a sufficient strain differentiation. Considering the importance that accurate characterization of bacterial pollution indicators could have as epidemiological tools, this study used a resistogram subtyping method for Escherichia coli as a tentative method of effecting a good monitoring of the environmental spread of this microorganism. The resistance of 313 E. coli strains of different origin (human, animal, sewage), previously identified by standard biochemical reactions, to 8 chemical compounds (inorganic, organic and dyes) and to 7 antibiotics was tested. The results indicated this method has a higher discriminatory power for chemicals than for drugs. Some typical resistotype patterns for E. coli from various sources are described.
