The bee venom neurotoxin apamin failed to affect 86Rb outflow and insulin release from rat pancreatic islets stimulated by D-glucose or the Ca2+-ionophore A23187. Apamin, in contrast to quinine or A23187, also failed to affect bioelectrical activity in mouse islet cells. These findings suggest that, like in erythrocytes, and at variance with the situation found in smooth muscle, liver or neuroblastoma cells, the Ca2+-activated K+ permeability in the pancreatic B-cell is resistant to apamin.
