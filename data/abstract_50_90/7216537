The results of a multiple regression analysis on the nasal carriage of antibiotic-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and the four major patient parameters, age, length of stay in hospital, sex and antibiotic use, is reported. The multiple correlation coefficient of the regression analysis was high and all the regression coefficients of the independent variables were statistically significant, confirming the validity of the analysis. Further, an analysis on the four patient parameters confirmed that the parameters are not correlated, hence the possibility of a bias being introduced into the regression model through interactions between the parameters is excluded. The resulting regression model was then studied and an application given with respect to an infection.
