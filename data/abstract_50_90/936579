Dibazole and vitamin B12 reduced production of hemagglutinin by influenza A (PR8 and WSN strain) and B-1/73 (Yamagata strain) viruses in chick embryos when inoculated at various intervals after infection. The drugs stimulated interferon production in serum and by blood leukocytes, showing also some protective effect in influenza infection in mice. The necessity of further study of relationships between the chemotherapeutic activity of drugs and their capacity to stimulate nonspecific resistance to infection is emphasized.
