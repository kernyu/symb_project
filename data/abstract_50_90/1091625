A sequence of deoxyribonucleic acid of 2.7 times 10-6 to 3.3 times 10-6 daltons which includes the TEM beta-lactamase gene is present on the small plasmid RSF 1030 (R-Amp). This same sequence is present on plasmid derivatives that have received a translocation of deoxyribonucleic acid specifying the TEM beta-lactamase and is also present on naturally occurring plasmids of the F1, F11, N, X, O, I, C, and W incompatibility groups that do not specify ampicillin resistance or specify O-type beta-lactamases.
