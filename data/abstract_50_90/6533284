The antitumor activity of recombinant human interferon-beta (ReIFN-beta) against 2 human melanomas, Mela3 and SK-MEL-26 cells, transplanted into nude mice was examined, comparing with that of natural interferon-beta (IFN-beta). The growth of Mela3 and SK-MEL-26 cells was inhibited significantly by the daily intravenous injection of 10(8) units(U)/kg of ReIFN-beta for 10 d starting from day 0. The effect of ReIFN-beta decreased when its administration was started from the established stage of tumor development. Intravenous injection of 10(7) U/kg of ReIFN-beta or IFN-beta did not significantly inhibit the growth of Mela3 cells. Mela3 cells, prepared from Mela3-bearing mice which had been injected 10(8) U/kg of ReIFN-beta intravenously for 10 d, showed the slight resistance to ReIFN-beta in vitro. Intratumoral injection of 10(7) U/kg of ReIFN-beta in the established stage of tumor development inhibited the growth of Mela3 and SK-MEL-26 cells significantly. This effect of ReIFN-beta was almost equivalent to that of IFN-beta. From the histological examination, these effects of intratumoral injection of ReIFN-beta or IFN-beta were suggested to be mediated by their direct anticellular activities, but not by immunological activities. These results indicate that the in vivo antitumor activity of ReIFN-beta was not essentially affected by the deficiency of carbohydrate.
