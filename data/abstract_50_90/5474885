A class of mutants of Ustilago maydis selected on a fungitoxic oxathiin lack of antimycin A-tolerant respiratory system which is present in wild-type cells. This system provides, directly or indirectly, for considerable resistance to antimycin A because growth of mutant cells lacking the system is much more sensitive to the antibiotic than that of the wild type. Antimycin A-sensitive O(2) uptake and growth is found in half of the progeny from crosses of mutant to wild type. All antimycin A-sensitive segregants are somewhat more resistant to oxathiins than the antimycin A-resistant segregants. The respiration of the mutant is strongly inhibited by cyanide and azide at concentrations which stimulate respiration of the wild type. Respiration of both mutant and wild type is about equally inhibited by rotenone. It appears that the mutation alters some component of the respiratory system located between the rotenone inhibition site and the antimycin A inhibition site that permits shift of electron transport to an alternate terminal oxidase when the normal electron transport pathway is blocked.
