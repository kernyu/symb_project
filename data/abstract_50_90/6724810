The treatment of infections in the ring of Waldeyer in children is an ever present problem. Most infections are caused by group A streptococci, and various antibiotics are routinely used for their treatment. In many cases, however, this treatment is ineffective as demonstrated by prolonged disease duration and recurrences. This may be due to the resistance of the pathogens to the used antibiotic, too low dose, or inadequate penetration of the drug into the focus of infection. To explain this problem the reported investigation was undertaken carrying out bacteriological investigations of the removed tonsils and determining antibiotic concentrations in tonsil homogenates and in the serum after cloxacillin and erythromycin treatment of 45 children aged 4-14 years subjected to tonsillectomy or adenotomy . It was found that the most frequent aetiological factors in angina and adenoiditis were group A streptococci. Cloxacillin and erythromycin are the antibiotics penetrating well into the lymphoid tissue and reaching high concentrations in the focus of infection but the courses of treatment should not be shorter than 10 days.
