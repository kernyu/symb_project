An unusual case of community-acquired necrotizing aspiration pneumonia with pulmonary abscess and empyema associated with Campylobacter fetus (formerly Vibrio fetus) in mixed culture is reported. This microaerophilic gram-negative curved bacillus has been increasingly associated with human disease. Unlike most pathogens associated with community-acquired aspiration pneumonia, this organism is usually resistant to penicillin. Infection associated with this organism is characteristically relapsing in nature and requires protracted antimicrobial therapy.
