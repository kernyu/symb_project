We have previously characterized two distinct pools of phosphatidylinositol (PI) in the WRK-1 rat mammary tumor cell, one whose metabolism is enhanced in response to vasopressin and another which is insensitive to hormonal manipulation. The purpose of the present study was to examine the relationship between cellular phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) and each of the two PI pools. We have found that in WRK-1 cells, vasopressin induces the rapid loss of PIP2 and the accumulation of inositol phosphates. By making use of kinetic differences in 32Pi uptake into the two pools of PI and assessing radioactivity levels in the 1-phosphate of PIP2, we have determined that hormone-sensitive PI is the precursor of approximately 60% of the cellular PIP2; the remainder is synthesized from the hormone-insensitive pool. Additional data indicate that PIP2 derived from hormone-sensitive PI is likewise hormone-sensitive, while that synthesized from hormone-insensitive PI remains stable over a long period of time and is not affected by the presence of vasopressin.
