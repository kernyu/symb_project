The methylotrophic bacterium Pseudomonas methanolica was shown to be very resistant to the bactericidal and mutagenic action of UV irradiation. The activity of reparation processes after UV irradiation was also detected as well as a weak photoreactivating activity in P. methanolica. The decrease in the survival rate of irradiated cells under the action of caffeine and acriflavine, reparation inhibitors, is indicative of the activity of the excision reparation systems and, possibly, the recombination branch of postreplicative reparation. No activity of the inducible reparation system was found. It has been concluded that the elevated resistance of P. methanolica cells to the bactericidal and mutagenic action of short-wavelength UV irradiation is associated with the activity of the reparation systems.
