Resistance emerging after fluoroquinolone therapy was investigated in a murine model of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection. Mice were infected intraperitoneally by one of six strains and treated with pefloxacin or ciprofloxacin. In mice challenged with a low inoculum (1.6 X 10(5) CFU), no resistance occurred. With a higher inoculum (1.5 X 10(8) CFU) and after a single dose of antibiotic, posttherapy (PT1) strains with decreased susceptibility to quinolones (4- to 32-fold less) were isolated at a variable rate. The presence of talcum (125 mg) in the peritoneal cavity increased the risk of resistance after therapy. Pefloxacin (25 or 200 mg/kg) and ciprofloxacin (25 mg/kg) yielded similar resistance rates (61 to 77%), but ciprofloxacin (10 mg/kg) produced more resistance (83%) than did ciprofloxacin (50 mg/kg) (44%) (P less than 0.02). Combined with a quinolone, ceftazidime (P less than 0.001) or amikacin (P less than 0.01), but not piperacillin, reduced the emergence of resistance. After several doses of ciprofloxacin, it was found that 25-mg/kg doses every 12 h produced more resistance than did 25-mg/kg doses every 8 h or 50-mg/kg doses every 12 h. Compared with the preceding experiments using parent strains, ciprofloxacin and pefloxacin were less efficient in killing bacteria in mice infected with PT1 strains. Moreover, in one of these mice, a highly resistant PT2 strain (64-fold MIC increase for the quinolones) emerged. Besides increased MICs of the quinolones, there was a two- to eightfold increase in imipenem MIC for all PT1 and PT2 strains without alteration of other beta-lactam and aminoglycoside susceptibility. Some PT1 strains also showed a decreased susceptibility to trimethoprim and chloramphenicol. During therapy with a quinolone, resistance can emerge rapidly, especially when there is a large number of bacteria or a foreign body present. This risk may depend on the dosing schedule and may be reduced by combined therapy.
