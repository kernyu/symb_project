In experiments on Fischer rats (F-344), both with common microflora and germ-free, the influence of the systemic destination of different antibiotics (tetracycline + ampicillin, gentamicin + kefzol, gentamicin, fradizine) on the intestinal microflora, the content of beta-ospartylglycine in feces and the colonization resistance of the intestinal tract to Staphylococcus aureus B-243 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa No. 93 has been studied. The early appearance of beta-aspartyl-glycine in the supernatant of fecal samples has been shown to be the first sign of dysbacteriosis and to indicate the decrease of the colonization resistance of the intestine to opportunistic bacteria.
