In general, coagulase-negative staphylococci were found to be relatively less susceptible to the lytic action of lysostaphin than coagulase-positive staphylococci. To achieve, arbitrarily, a lysis greater than 75%, it was necessary to use an increased concentration of enzyme or a longer incubation period than that usually required with coagulase-positive strains. For the most part, the cultures studied were sensitive to oxacillin, cloxacillin, dicloxacillin, nafcillin, ancillin, cephalothin, cephaloridine, fusidic acid, lincomycin, novobiocin, and neomycin [median minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of 1.56 mug/ml or less]. Some degree of resistance (median MIC values of 12.5 mug/ml or greater) to benzylpenicillin, ampicillin, methicillin, tetracycline, chloretetracycline, erythromycin, ristocetin, and lysostaphin was found. Ten methicillin-resistant, coagulase-negative staphylococal strains were found to be cross-resistant to all nine of the penicillins tested, but much less resistant to the two cephalosporin analogues. In several instances, some of these strains seemed to be more sensitive to benzylpenicillin and to certain of the semisynthetic penicillins than to methicillin. Of the 18 antibiotics tested with the viable plate count method, the methicillin-resistant strains were found to be the most sensitive to lincomycin and novobiocin.
