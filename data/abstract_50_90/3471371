The susceptibility of 7,763 clinical isolates at four medical centers to CI-934 and three comparative quinolones was tested. CI-934 was the most active compound against Gram-positive isolates, such as staphylococci (MIC 90 = 0.25 microgram/ml), and enterococci (MIC 90 = 0.5 microgram/ml). CI-934 was the least active of these drugs against Pseudomonas spp. (MIC 90 = greater than 8.0 micrograms/ml). Against all other organisms CI-934 was very effective, being most comparable with enoxacin. With a selected group of isolates, CI-934 demonstrated high activity against Haemophilus influenzae (MIC 90 = 0.06 microgram/ml), Neisseria meningitidis and N. gonorrhoeae (MIC 90 = 0.13 microgram/ml), Listeria monocytogenes (MIC 90 = 1.0 microgram/ml), methicillin-resistant staphylococci (MIC 90 = 0.13 microgram/ml), and modest activity against anaerobes. Disk diffusion susceptibility testing of CI-934 was evaluated using 3-, 5-, and 10-micrograms disks. Because of its lower interpretive error rate, the 3-micrograms disk is tentatively recommended. With less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml and greater than 4 micrograms/ml as the susceptible and resistant MIC breakpoints, the corresponding 3-micrograms disk zone diameters breakpoints are greater than or equal to 15 mm and less than or equal to 11 mm. Because most isolates of Pseudomonas spp. are not susceptible to CI-934 and the zone size interpretive error rate is particularly high (33%) with Pseudomonas spp., we suggest that isolates of this genus not be tested for clinical purposes.
