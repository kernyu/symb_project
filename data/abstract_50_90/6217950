In a randomized trial, 149 patients with uncomplicated gonorrhoea were treated with a single intramuscular dose of 1.0 g mezlocillin, 150 with 2.0 g ampicillin plus 1.0 g probenecid orally and 150 with a single dose of 1.8 mega units of procaine penicillin. Cure rates at 3, 10 and 17 days after treatment were 97%, 99% and 96% for mezlocillin, 95%, 99% and 95% for ampicillin, and 97%, 98% and 98% for procaine penicillin, respectively. The incidence of post-gonococcal urethritis was 11.3% for ampicillin plus probenecid, 10.9% for procaine penicillin and 10.5% for mezlocillin. Side-effects after all three regimens were minimal.
