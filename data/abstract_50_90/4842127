The virulence of cell surface-associated, glucan synthesis-defective mutants of Streptococcus mutans strain 6715-13 was studied. Representatives from three groups of such mutants were tested for their pathogenicity in conventionalized, specific pathogen-free rats and gnotobiotic rats. The mutants differ from the wild-type strain in that each failed to form plaque on the smooth surfaces of the teeth and to cause smooth surface caries. Although the ability to form cell surface-associated glucans was not a strict requirement for the expression of virulence in the sulci of the teeth, it augmented virulence at such sites. However, the ability to form cell surface-associated glucans and to adhere to the teeth was clearly not the sole determinant of virulence.
