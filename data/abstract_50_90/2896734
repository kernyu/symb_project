A 7-month prospective survey for cefazolin-resistant Gram-negative bacilli in cardiac surgery patients, receiving cefazolin prophylaxis, showed that 58 (67%) of 87 were colonized with enterobacter, 37 (64%) with citrobacter, 33 (57%) with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and seven (2%) with Serratia marcescens. About 50% of colonization occurred before cefazolin prophylaxis and was present on admission to the intensive care unit. Typing of strains showed that horizontal transmission accounted for at most 14% of carriage. Cefazolin prophylaxis (and high gastric pH) were associated with increased levels of postoperative colonization, most notably for enterobacter. About 25% of colonization with enterobacter, pseudomonas, and serratia was followed by clinical infection. Enterobacter cloacae was the most common pathogen and pneumonia the most common infection. Infections contributed to eight of 11 deaths; four of the eight involved enterobacter. Potential control measures include eliminating endogenous Gram-negative flora by gut decontamination or at least stemming the increase in level of colonization that occurred after surgery.
