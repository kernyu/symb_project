The in vitro activity of six antituberculous agents and 13 nonspecific antibiotics and sulfonamides against 72 isolates of different atypical mycobacterial strains obtained in Argentina and Uruguay, was evaluated by the proportions susceptibility method on Lowenstein-Jensen medium. A non-homogeneous response was observed in strains of the same species. The use of nonspecific antibiotics and sulfonamides in the treatment of mycobacterioses cases should therefore be decided according to the results of susceptibility testing on the strain isolated from the patient. The method used here could be easily adopted by laboratories where the proportions method is currently employed to test the susceptibility of M. tuberculosis to specific drugs.
