R plasmid RP4 inhibits the fertility of R. lupini. An RP4 carrying R. lupini donor strain is no longer capable of transferring chromosomal genes. After loss of RP4 the R. lupini fertility reappears. Plasmid RP4 spontaneously mutates at high frequency in R. lupini. RP4 mutants which do not inbibit fertility were isolated. These mutants were always transfer-defective, too. It is postulated that the genetic information for fertility inhibition in R. lupini is a substantial part of the transfer unit of the RP4 plasmid.
