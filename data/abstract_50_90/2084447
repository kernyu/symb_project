The aim of this study was to ascertain whether bacteria from Vibrionaceae family are present in crude and mechanically cleaned urban sewage and what is their profile of resistance to selected chemotherapeutics. The presence in sewage of bacteria of Vibrionaceae family was proved. They constitute only small percentage of total number of bacteria. No influence of mechanical purification process of sewage on the reduction of total number of bacteria and bacteria from Vibrionaceae family was seen. The number of bacteria from Vibrionaceae family amounted to 6-9 cells per 100 ml of crude sewage and 2-16 cells per 100 ml of mechanically cleaned sewage. From samples tested the following species were isolated: non 01 V. cholerae, V. fluvialis, V. parahaemolyticus, A. hydrophila, A. caviae, A. sobria. All strains were sensitive to neomycin and nalidixic acid and with few exceptions of A. caviae strains to streptomycin, gentamicin, doxycycline and chloramphenicol .
