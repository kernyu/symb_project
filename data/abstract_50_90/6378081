The chemotherapy of cholecystocholangitis in patients with virus hepatitis was estimated. Antibiotics, furagin and pathogenetic drugs were used for the treatment. The antibiotics were chosen with regard to their sensitivity to the bile microflora. This resulted in sanation of the bile ducts. Furagin was less effective. The use of the pathogenetic drugs alone was ineffective in the majority of patients.
