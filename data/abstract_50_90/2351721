The MicroScan system was compared with agar dilution screen plates for the detection of high-level aminoglycoside resistance in 182 enterococcal isolates. Both the frozen Gram-Positive Combo Type 2 and the freeze-dried Type 5 panels were evaluated. The specificity of both panels for the detection of streptomycin and gentamicin resistance was 100%. However, the sensitivities for the detection of gentamicin and streptomycin resistance were 84 and 31%, respectively, for the Type 2 panels and 90 and 41%, respectively, for the Type 5 panels. The sensitivities of these panels for the detection of enterococcal high-level aminoglycoside resistance are inadequate for routine use.
