The occurrence of drug resistance and its plasmid-mediated transferability was investigated in 140 environmental strains of Vibrio cholerae non-O1 and 6 strains of Vibrio cholerae, both O1 and non-O1, of clinical origin. Of the 146 strains tested, 93% were resistant to at least one drug and 74% were resistant to two or more antibiotics. The O1 strains were susceptible to all antibiotics used. A total of 26 of 28 selected resistant wild strains carried R plasmids that were transferable by intraspecific and intergeneric matings. The most common transmissible R factor determined resistance to ampicillin, amoxicillin, and sulfanilamide (30%), followed by resistance to ampicillin and amoxicillin (13%) and resistance to ampicillin, amoxicillin, phosphomycin, and sulfanilamide (9%). Comparison of the three methods of plasmid analysis showed that the method of Birnboim and Doly (Nucleic Acids Res. 7:1513-1523, 1979) without EDTA and lysozyme was optimal for isolation of both large and small plasmids in environmental V. cholerae strains. Most strains harbored more than one plasmid, and the molecular sizes ranged from 1.1 to 74.8 megadaltons. The plasmids of high molecular size (around 74 megadaltons) were responsible for the resistance pattern transferred and were maintained with high stability in the hosts.
