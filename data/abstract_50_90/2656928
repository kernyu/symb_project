For many of today's clean-contaminated surgical operations antibiotic prophylaxis is a generally accepted and proven procedure. On the basis of a literature survey the parameters to be considered are analyzed: bactericidal spectrum, pharmacokinetics (peak plasma and tissue concentrations, tissue penetration, persistence at high-risk sites and elimination), minimal toxicity, absence of (above all, serious) adverse drug reactions (coagulation disorders, etc.), avoidance of resistance, suitability for single-dose prophylaxis even when the operation is unforeseeably delayed after the administration of the antibiotic, or when the operation lasts a very long time. Finally, the antimicrobial chosen must be cost-effective. The decisive factor, however, remains the proven clinical efficacy for the procedure concerned. There should be no prejudging of any issue until the relevant data have been collected, especially in the case of facts suggesting that single-dose antimicrobial agents are effective even in colorectal surgery, and that cephalosporins of the third generation might offer advantages over those of the first.
