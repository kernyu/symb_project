3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (diuron), an inhibitor of cytochrome b oxidation, has been used for the selection of three resistant mutants (diur) of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The mutant diur-64 exhibits in vivo cross-resistance to antimycin A while diur-34 and diur-1 are more sensitive to antimycin A than the parental strain. The three mutants exhibit mitochondrial inheritance according to the following criteria: mitotic segregation of diuron-resistant and diuron-sensitive diploids is obtained among the diploid progeny of a cross between diur and dius; non-Mendelian segregation of diuron resistance (4:0) is observed in spores of tetrads issued from diuron-resistant diploid; extensive ethidium bromide treatment leads to the formation of Q- mutants which no longer transmit diur and dius alleles. Evidence for two distinct diuron-resistant loci were obtained by allelism tests. Recombination analysis shows that diuron-resistance is not located in the polar region of the mitochondrial genome. The diur loci are not linked to the erythromycin locus since the upper limit in recombinants frequency (26%) for a non-polar region is obtained between diur and eryr. A low recombinants frequency (3%) is observed in crosses between diur-34 mutation and the two mutants cob1 and cob2 suggesting that diur-34 might be located between these two cytochrome-b-deficient loci. The resistance to diuron is also expressed in vitro since the oxidation rates of succinate by sonicated submitochondrial particles from the mutants are clearly less sensitive to diuron than that of the wild type.
