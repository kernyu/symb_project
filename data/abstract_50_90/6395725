A virulent Salmonella dublin isolate was made histidine-requiring (his-) to allow recognition. The his- derivative, SL1367 (still calf-virulent), was then given by transduction and mutation, a transposon-generated non-reverting aromatic biosynthesis (aro) defect; this defect caused loss of virulence for the mouse. The his- aro- derivative strain, SL1438, was effective as a live vaccine in mice. Twenty male Holstein calves were divided into 4 groups. Groups I, II, and III were vaccinated IM at 2 weeks and at 3 weeks of age with aromatic-dependent (aro-) S dublin strain SL1438. Groups I and III received freshly prepared vaccine and group II received lyophilized vaccine. Serious adverse reactions to the vaccination were not seen. After vaccination, the mean maximum increase in rectal temperature was 1.8 C in group I and III calves and 0.6 C in group II calves. Fewer group II calves developed diarrhea (1 of 5) or positive blood cultures (0 of 5) after vaccination compared with group I and III calves (6 of 10 and 5 of 10, respectively). Postvaccination diarrhea was mild and of short duration. Group IV was comprised of 5 nonvaccinated calves. At 5 weeks of age, all calves were challenge exposed orally. Group I, II, and IV calves were challenge exposed with 10(11) virulent S dublin SL1367. Group III was challenge exposed with 10(11) virulent S typhimurium UCD 108-11. Subsequently, fever and diarrhea (lasting 1 to 3 days), but no deaths, were observed in the vaccinated calves. Four of the 5 nonvaccinated (group IV) calves died (P less than 0.001) within 8 days after challenge exposure. Aro- S dublin SL 1438 did not cause serious adverse effects and provided protection against oral challenge exposure with either virulent S dublin or S typhimurium.
