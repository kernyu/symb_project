The author reports about the treatment of 393 bacterial urinary tract infections with TMP/SMZ. It is shown that the success of treatment significantly depends on the constitution of the efferent urinary passages (obstructive and non-obstructive alterations, unchanged urinary passages) and the kind of organisms but only insignificantly on the duration of treatment. The germinal spectrum and the number of resistant strains of the individual kinds of organisms correspond with the results of other investigators. TMP/SMZ is a very potent antibiotic drug against the most pathogenic urinary organisms at a low rate of side effects.
