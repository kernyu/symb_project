An attempt has been made to classify the wide range of available antimicrobial chemotherapeutic agents from the practical viewpoint. A group of drugs with selective indications and a series of alternative chemotherapeutic agents are distinguished from chemotherapeutic agents for everyday medical routine (penicillin G and analogs, ampicillin, tetracyclines, sulfonamides). The indications for the main drugs and some practical guidelines for chemotherapy are summarized. The excessive commercial supply of ampicillin derivatives and cephalosporins comes in for special comment. It is emphasized that some valuable antibiotics (cephalosporins, carbenicillin, gentamycin, kanamycin) should be kept in reserve.
