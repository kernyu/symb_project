Norfloxacin (NOR) was compared to pipemidic acid (PA) in complicated urinary tract infections (UTIs) caused by pathogens susceptible to both agents to evaluate the antibacterial activity of the new 4-quinolone derivative. Sixty-five patients were randomly allocated to receive NOR or PA, 400 mg bid for 7 days, and the results evaluated for treatment efficacy at 5 weeks after completion of therapy. Overall microbiological cure was significantly greater in NOR-treated patients, as 19 of 26 were cured (73%), compared to only 16 of 39 (41%) in the PA group (p less than 0.05). Failures and relapses, considered together, were significantly (p less than 0.05) less frequent in patients treated with NOR (4/26) than in those receiving PA (18/39). Clinical response was strictly related to microbiological outcome: NOR had a broader antibacterial spectrum than PA and in this study seemed to be more efficacious in the treatment of complicated UTIs caused only by bacteria susceptible to both agents. This may be related to greater antibacterial activity and/or tissue penetration by NOR, which is thus to be preferred, according to the results of our study, in the treatment of complicated UTIs.
