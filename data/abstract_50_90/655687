The possibility of eliminating the drug resistance determinants in penicillinase-producing staphylococci under the effect of an acridine "dimer", synthesized by French scientists was studied. Comparison of the eliminating activity of a number of acridine compounds, such as acrichin, acriflavine, proflavine and "dimer" showed that the new derivative of acridine as well as the other acridines used in the experiments induced elimination of the penicillinase plasmids when used in the sublethal concentrations.
