Activation of human natural killer (NK) cells in vitro with interferon (IFN) and poly I:C results in a partial loss of sensitivity of these cells to suppression by PGE2. The acquired resistance to suppression can be induced with the large granular lymphocytes (LGL) in the absence of monocytes. With K562, HSB, and CEM used as NK target cells, the IFN-induced resistance to suppression by PGE2 is observed with all three target cells. Furthermore, ADCC activity of IFN-activated cells against tumor (SB-TNP) and erythroid (CRC-TNP) target cells is also less susceptible to suppression by PGE2. The dual effect of IFN on NK cells is prompt; the augmentation of NK activity and the acquired resistance to suppression by PGE2 can be seen after 3 hr of treatment with IFN. Both of these characteristics seem to be quite stable for at least 24 hr. Spleen cells from mice (CBA, C3H, and BALB/c nude) treated in vivo with poly I:C also acquire partial resistance to suppression by PGE2. Our data therefore suggest that IFN-stimulated NK cells are protected from suppression by PGE2. Biologically, the IFN-induced protective effect may be beneficial to host resistance to neoplasia.
