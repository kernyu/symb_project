The effect of combined administration of ethyl alcohol with caffeine and hydroxyzine on cardiac volume and vascular resistance was studied. Combined administration of these compounds diminished cardiac stroke volume and minute output and increased general vascular resistance. Simultaneous administration of ethanol with caffeine and hydroxyzine exerts an unfavorable effect on haemodynamics of circulatory system.
