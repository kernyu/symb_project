Antagonistic and bacteriocinogenic activity was studied in 169 strains of meningococci of various serological groups and with different localization in the human organism at the time of isolation. Bacteriocinogenic activity was revealed in all the meningococcus strains (by delayed antagonism method), and, in addition, antagonistic activity was found in 100 strains. The inhibitory activity was the greatest in meningococci isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid. The data obtained suggest an important inhibitory activity of meningococci, along with their resistance to the antagonistic activity of the nasopharyngeal microorganisms, in the manifestation of pathogenic properties in them.
