A plasmid containing a single cloned insertion of Haemophilus influenzae chromosomal deoxyribonucleic acid that carried a novobiocin resistance marker was 2.6 times larger than the parent plasmid, RSF0885, which conferred ampicillin resistance. The most frequent type of transformation by this plasmid (designated pNov1) was the transfer of novobiocin resistance to the chromosome, with the loss of the plasmid from the recipient. In accord with this observation, after radioactively labeled pNov1 entered a competent cell, it lost acid-insoluble counts, as well as biological activity. The level of ampicillin transformation, which involved establishment of the plasmid, was almost two orders of magnitude lower than the level of novobiocin transformation. Both types of transformation were depressed profoundly in rec-1 and rec-2 mutants. Ampicillin transformants of wild-type cells always contained plasmids that were the same size as pNov1, although most of these transformants were not novobiocin resistant. Plasmid pNov1 in wild-type cells but not in rec-1 or rec-2 cells often recombined with the chromosome, causing a homologous region of the chromosome to be substituted for part of the plasmid, as shown by restriction and genetic analyses. Our data suggested that plasmid-chromosome recombination took place only around the time when the plasmid entered a cell, rather than after it became established.
