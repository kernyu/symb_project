A streptomycin resistant Campylobacter jejuni inoculated per os into two populations of Syrian hamsters (one endemically harboring C. jejuni, the other free of C. jejuni) established chronic colonization of the organism in both groups. Diet, steroid administration, age of hamsters or prior exposure to C. jejuni did not appreciably alter incidence of diarrhea or colonization of C. jejuni. The majority of hamsters sampled during the course of the experiment (1 to 22 weeks) shed streptomycin resistant C. jejuni in the feces. In four hamsters sampled at 14, 17, 19, and 22 weeks, post inoculation, streptomycin resistant C. jejuni were recovered in ileal, cecal, jejunal, duodenal and colonic contents (10(4) to 10(7) colony forming units/gram of intestinal content). The hamster appears to be a potentially useful model for the study of intestinal colonization of enteropathogenic C. jejuni. Hamsters shedding C. jejuni in their feces for extended periods of time should be considered a zoonotic threat to both pet owners and laboratory personnel.
