Examination of 108 patients showed that burn disease was accompanied by significant impairments in the host natural resistance. Inclusion of intramuscular administrations of crystalline lysozyme into the complex therapy of such patients during septicotoxemia provided an increase in the factors of humoral and cell immunity. In most of the cases the dynamics of the indices of the host immunological reactivity correlated with the character of the clinical signs of the burn disease. The positive effect of lysozyme was evident in the cases with severe complications such as pneumonia, bacteriemia and burns of the upper respiratory organs.
