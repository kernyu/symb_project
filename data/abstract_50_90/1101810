The experiments showed that among 110 Salmonella strains resistant to 1 or more antibiotics 54.5 per cent of the cultures transfered their resistance to E. coli when grown in vitro. The frequency of the transmissive drug resistance in Salmonella was directly proportional to the number of r-determinants in R-factor. The cultures resistant to ampicillin and kanamycin proved to be the most competent donors.
