Following the discovery of four imported chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum infections in the Province of Yogyakarta (Island of Java) sensitivity tests were carried out in the Province of East Kalimantan Island of Borneo). Twenty subjects were given 25 mg. of chloroquine base per kilogram of body weight over three days. Two infections were found resistant at the RII level and a third at the RI level with early recrudescence on day 7. In the other 17 cases followed up to day 21, six were found again with asexual parasites between day 9 and day 14 and a seventh on day 21. These results confirm the presence of chloroquine resistance in P. falciparum in East Kalimantan and, together with previous findings, suggest a widespread distribution of chloroquine-resistant falciparum malaria in this Province of Indonesia. It is particularly interesting to note that chloroquine-resistant falciparum malaria has now been detected in almost all the area of dispersion of A. balabacensis.
