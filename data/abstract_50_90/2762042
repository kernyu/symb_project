Some 151 isolates of coagulase-negative staphylococci isolated from patients at an Australian teaching hospital were characterized by biochemical analysis, antibiotic sensitivity patterns and slime production. S. epidermidis was the predominant species (64%) isolated from clinically significant infections, and all S. epidermidis isolates from true bacteremias produced slime. Forty-nine per cent were resistant to methicillin and 61% to gentamicin. S. haemolyticus isolates from clinically significant infections also showed antibiotic resistance and 80% were resistant to more than five antibiotics. The importance of coagulase-negative staphylococci as pathogens in this large teaching hospital was confirmed.
