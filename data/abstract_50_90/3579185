Dermatophilosis is a contagious enzootic disease in tropical areas but which sporadically appears in temperate countries. During an outbreak in Sudan, the resistance level of the Nilotic cattle (Dinka breed) and various crosses has been recorded. The use of Long Acting Terramycin for treating infected cattle is discussed as well. A single injection of Long Acting Terramycin (20 mg/kg) is curative in 35.9% of the cases. The less severe the infections are, the best results are obtained. Treatment response does not seem modified by the breed of the treated cattle.
