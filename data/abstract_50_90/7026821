Synergistic effect of thiamphenicol (TP) and cephalothin (CET) on Bacteroides fragilis was proved in vitro. Especially its effect was much clear on B. fragilis which is possible to produce beta-lactamase. Synergistic bactericidal effect of TP and CET was proved. Chemotherapeutic effect of TP and CET against experimental mixed infectious mouse due to E. coli (beta-lactamase -) and B. fragilis (beta-lactamase +) was proved.
