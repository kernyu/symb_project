This report describes the capacities of ampicillin, vancomycin, streptomycin, gentamicin, and combinations thereof to prevent endocarditis in rabbits challenged with either streptomycin-resistant (three strains) or streptomycin-susceptible (one strain) Streptococcus faecalis. Vancomycin (15 mg/kg) alone was effective in preventing infection with three of four strains, including two which were streptomycin resistant. Vancomycin (30 mg/kg) alone was effective against the other streptomycin-resistant strain. The vancomycin-gentamicin combination was the only therapeutic regimen to demonstrate complete prophylaxis for all strains regardless of streptomycin susceptibility. The ampicillin-gentamicin combination was variably effective despite in vitro synergism.
