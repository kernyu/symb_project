Furazolidone was more active than 3-(1-methyl)-5-nitro-2-imidazolyl-methylideneamino)-2-oxazolidinone (MABN) against a series of 34 isolates of Pasteurella and 11 of Yersinia (formerly designated Pasteurella). However, the nitroimidazole was superior to furazolidone by both subcutaneous and oral routes against a series of mouse infections incited by strains of Pasteurella. It also was superior to furazolidone and sulfaquinoxaline when administered in the diet against two Pasteurella strains in a fowl cholera model infection in chickens. The good in vitro activity of MABN plus its low toxicity suggest its further study as an agent for fowl cholera and the shipping fever complex of cattle.
