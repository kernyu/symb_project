Intraperitoneal injection of chlorite-oxidized oxyamylose (COAM) protected mice against mengo, vaccinia, Semliki Forest, and influenza APR8 viruses. Topical administration in the eye of rabbits partially inhibited the development of experimental herpetic keratoconjunctivitis. COAM resembled polyacrylic acid in many aspects, but it was markedly less toxic. For systemic administration, the therapeutic index was on the order of magnitude of 1:300 to 1:500. Although the in vivo antiviral effect of COAM wore off faster than that of polyacrylic acid, protection lasted for several weeks. Against mengovirus, such prolonged protection was achieved only when polymer and virus were injected intraperitoneally. Protection against intravenous vaccinia virus was not dependent on the injection route of COAM. Experiments on the mode of action of COAM pointed to macrophages as possible mediators of the antiviral effect. The fact that small amounts of interferon appeared in the serum after administration of high doses of COAM suggests that interferon may play a role in the induction of antiviral resistance by COAM.
