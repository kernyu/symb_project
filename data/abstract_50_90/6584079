Cytoplasmic hybrid (cybrid) cell lines were formed by fusing whole cells of rat yolk sac tumor cell line (EST-II) with cytoplasts of mouse fibroblastic cell line (B-82cap), a variant of mouse L cell line that is deficient in thymidine kinase (TK-) and resistant to chloramphenicol (capr). The cybrid cell line with the nucleus of EST-II and cytoplasma of B-82cap was successfully obtained using double selection with HAT and chloramphenicol-containing medium. The cybrid's ability to synthesize proteins such as albumin, alpha-fetoprotein, gamma-EST, and gamma-GTP was found to be approximately one-fourth that of the nuclear donor, EST-II, at a early time of growth in culture, but this was followed by a gradual increase during the period of observation. The nude mice undergoing subcutaneous transplantation of 1 X 10(6) cells of EST-II and cybrid were killed by the tumor growth, with the survival time being 56 +/- 11 and 105 +/- 25 days, respectively. The histologic findings of cybrid tumor closely resembled those of the nuclear donor, EST-II. These facts suggest that factors from both the nucleus and cytoplasma will be able to affect the gene expression of the cybrid cell line.
