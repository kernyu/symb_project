Transformation of competent Bacillus subtilis lysogenic for SP02 with any of three plasmids (pCM194, pUB110, pAM77) generates drug-resistant transformants of which 5 to 20% have lost the infectivity and immunity associated with the SP02 prophage. Such cured derivatives can be again lysogenized with SP02 and again cured by introduction of a different plasmid. Elimination of the SP02 prophage was not detected when plasmids were introduced by PBS1 transduction or by transformation of protoplasts. Similarly, transformants of B. subtilis selected for chromosome markers retained the prophage. The phi 105 prophage was not eliminated from competent B. subtilis transformed with plasmids.
