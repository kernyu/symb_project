We have recently reported the in vivo augmentation of resistance to experimental Candida albicans injection by amphotericin B in mice and have shown that this event is concurrent with the appearance in the spleen of a highly candidacidal cell population reactive in vitro against 51Cr-labeled yeast cells. In the present study we characterize these in vitro fungicidal effectors as macrophages and describe the conditions of amphotericin B treatment most suitable for inducing candidacidal activity. We also report that macrophages from intact mice can be activated in vitro to become cytotoxic against Candida. The possible mechanisms through which the amphotericin B activated macrophages exert their increased anti-Candida activity are also investigated.
