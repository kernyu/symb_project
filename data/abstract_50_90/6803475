The efficacy of four different disinfectants on spiroplasmas pathogenic for plants, insects and vertebrates was determined using a microtiter technique. The results of the sensitivity testing indicate that spiroplasmas display a considerable resistance in comparison to cell wall bearing organisms. Particularly honey bee spiroplasmas proved to be less sensitive to the disinfectants tested, whereas Spiroplasma citri and the tick spiroplasmas showed a susceptibility comparable to E. coli and Staph. aureus. The findings are discussed in relation to the technique used and in respect of the implications for laboratory work.
