Antibiotic resistance of non-typhoid Salmonellae is in Czechoslovakia continuously monitored by a computer and its transferability is studied, on an all-nation level, within the Federal Plan of Scientific Investigation and Development. Restance and its transferability was surveyed in strains of Salmonella from humans, from farm animals, from the food chain as well as from surface and waste waters. Proportion of antibiotic-resistant Salmonella strains did not, in general, increase during the four-year period of 1973 to 1977. While resistant strains from humans as well as farm animals show a high degree of transferability, strains from food samples lack, in general, the transfer ability. This might be inferred that strains causing human salmonellosis which are carried to man trough foodchain, gain their character of transferability directly in the gut, i.e. from E. coli strains, and mainly due to presence of therapeutically given antibiotics.
