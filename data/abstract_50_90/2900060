The effects of acute ethanol exposure of chick spinal cord neurons were studied in tissue culture, using whole-cell voltage-clamp techniques. Results indicate that ethanol produces a persistent increase in the sensitivity of spinal neurons to GABA and glycine, with no change in input resistance or resting membrane potential. Glutamate responses, in contrast, are unaffected by ethanol.
