Enterococci exhibit two types of resistance to streptomycin. Moderately high-level resistance is observed in most naturally occurring strains and can be overcome by simultaneous exposure to penicillin. In addition, very high-level resistance is found in those strains against which penicillin plus streptomycin fail to produce synergism in vitro. To study the mechanism of streptomycin resistance in enterococci, ribosomes from a wild-type strain and from a highly streptomycin-resistant mutant were isolated, characterized, and studied in an in vitro amino acid incorporation system. The ribosomes from the organism with moderately high-level streptomycin resistance were sensitive to streptomycin in vitro, suggesting that this type of resistance is caused by failure of streptomycin to reach the ribosomes. Very high-level resistance (and lack of penicillin-streptomycin synergism), on the other hand, appears to be due to ribosomally mediated streptomycin resistance.
