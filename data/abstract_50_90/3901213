Imipenem is a new beta-lactam antibiotic with a wide spectrum of activity against gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. The efficacy and toxicity of this drug, when administered parenterally in combination with the dehydropeptidase I inhibitor cilastatin, were studied in 41 hospitalized patients with serious infections. Clinical cure was achieved in 26 (79%) of the 33 patients who could be evaluated and microbiologic cure in 23 (85%) of the 27 patients who could be evaluated. Adverse clinical or laboratory reactions were observed in seven (17%) of the 41 patients. Thus, imipenem/cilastatin was highly effective in the treatment of a wide variety of serious bacterial infections.
