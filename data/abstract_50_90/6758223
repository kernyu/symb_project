A strain of Plasmodium berghei made resistant to a 244 mg/kg daily dose of mefloquine by interrupted subcurative therapy in successive passages in weanling rats, was maintained for more than six months under drug pressure and was cryopreserved. Experiments with this strain have shown its loss of virulence for intact mice. In splenectomized Swiss mice infection with this resistant strain is transient. The mefloquine resistance of this line was unstable and the strain became sensitive to mefloquine after 10 serial drug-free passages but did not recover its infectivity to mice.
