Aminoglycosides have important roles as perioperative adjunctive antibiotics in the surgical management of peritonitis. In the past, most surgeons have used gentamicin in combination with a drug aimed at intraperitoneal anaerobic pathogens, either clindamycin or metronidazole. Amikacin has been traditionally reserved for culture-proved infections due to gram-negative organisms resistant to gentamicin or other aminoglycosides. At the Minneapolis Veterans Administration Medical Center, a worrisome incidence of gentamicin-resistant hospital isolates led to a decision to make amikacin the exclusive, routine surgical aminoglycoside for all abdominal infections, as well as all hospital-acquired infections in surgical patients involving gram-negative aerobes and requiring parenteral therapy. This report describes the resultant three-year experience with amikacin in surgical patients. Data from four research studies involving these patients suggest that exclusive amikacin use has not led to the emergence of amikacin-resistant organisms or to significant nephrotoxicity. Amikacin use in surgical patients is supported in hospital environments where gentamicin resistance is judged to be a significant clinical risk factor.
