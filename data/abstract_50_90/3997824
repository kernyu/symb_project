We have determined the complete sequence of the nuclear gene encoding the small subunit (17 S) rRNA of the ciliated protozoan Tetrahymena thermophila. The gene encodes an RNA molecule which is 1753 nucleotides in length. The sequence of the Tetrahymena small subunit rRNA is homologous to those of other eukaryotes, and the predicted secondary structure for the molecule includes features which are characteristic of eukaryotic small subunit rRNAs. We have also determined the nature of two different mutations in the Tetrahymena 17 S gene which result in resistance to the aminoglycoside antibiotics paromomycin and hygromycin. In each case we have identified a single base change near the 3' end of the rRNA, within a region that is highly evolutionarily conserved in both sequence and secondary structure. Analysis of the effects of these mutations on rRNA structure, and of the impact of these drugs on translation, should help to elucidate the role of the small subunit ribosomal RNA in ribosome function.
