A group of rats was fed on control liquid diet, while another group was fed on liquid diet containing alcohol up to 36% of the total calories. After 4, 8 and 12 weeks of treatment ECG, haematocrit, histological structure of the heart, blood pressure, cardiac output, distribution of the organ fraction of cardiac output (by Sapirstein's method and 85Sr labelled microsphere technique), nutritive blood flow and circulatory resistance of the organs were studied. A mild repolarization disturbance was shown by the ECG record of the alcohol exposed animals. Haematocrit values and the histological structure of the heart did not change in any of the groups. Relative heart weight increased, blood pressure, total peripheral resistance and nutritive blood flow of the myocardium decreased, while myocardial vascular resistance increased. There was no significant interaction between the effects of alcohol and the duration of exposure to alcohol for any of the parameters monitored. It is concluded that chronic alcohol intake should be taken into consideration in aetiology of ischaemic heart disease.
