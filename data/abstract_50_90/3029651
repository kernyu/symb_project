The inhibitory effect of niridazole on hydrogen production by metronidazole-resistant (CDC-85) and susceptible (C1-NIH) Trichomonas vaginalis strains was investigated. The results show that niridazole is more effective than metronidazole in inhibiting hydrogen production by the resistant isolate. In CDC-85 aerobic inhibition requires a 4-fold increase in metronidazole concentration compared with that required anaerobically, but the corresponding factor for niridazole is only 1.5-fold. Reduction of the drug by a hydrogenosome-enriched preparation gave rise to a multiline electron spin resonance detectable signal, which is due to a nitrogen-centred radical.
