It was shown that mytilan, a polysaccharide isolated from the mantle of Crenomytilus grayanus stimulated the host nonspecific resistance to infections. This was evident from the survival rate of the animals infected with lethal doses of E. coli and S. aureus. In addition, the combined use of gentamicin and mytilan in treatment of the infections caused by the above organisms enabled to increase the antibiotic therapy efficacy with using lower doses of both the antibiotic and the polysaccharide.
