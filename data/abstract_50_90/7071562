The frequency with which various bacteria are isolated from samples of hospitalized patients and the occurrence of sensitivity to antimicrobial agents in these bacteria are described. Data were collected and summarized by an electronic data processing system. Sensitivity data were obtained with the disc diffusion test carried out by the Bauer/Kirby method. E. coli and S. aureus were the most frequently isolated organisms. Pseudomonas sp. (in 90% Pseud. aeruginosa) took second place behind E. coli among gramnegative rod bacteria. As a rule more than 50% of grampositive and gramnegative bacteria were sensitive to betalactam antibiotics and broad spectrum agents. Aminocyclitols were the most potent drugs. Strains resistant to netilmicin or amikacin were only exceptionally observed. A comparison of the occurrence of sensitive bacteria from 1975 to 1980 revealed that with rare exceptions no decrease of sensitivity to standard drug occurred in E. coli, the Klebsiella-Enterobacter-Serratia group, Pseudo. aeruginosa and S. aureus.
