A prospective randomized study was undertaken in 100 patients undergoing cesarean section to evaluate the efficacy of cefotaxime when given as a single-dose versus the more traditional triple-dose regimen for prophylaxis. Analysis of the results demonstrated no significant differences in febrile morbidity (14 versus 20%) or postoperative endometritis (10 versus 14%) between the single- and triple-dose groups, respectively. Pretherapy aerobic and anaerobic placental cultures were positive in 60% of the overall study population. In those patients who subsequently developed endometritis, seven (58%) had a positive placental culture, suggesting that this technique is relatively nonspecific as a screening procedure. Results of transcervical culture in the endometritis patients most often demonstrated a polymicrobial picture. Several of the organisms cultured were found to be resistant to cefotaxime, supporting the need to better guide antimicrobial therapy by routine endometrial culturing in patients who fail prophylaxis. The results of the present study suggest that single-dose administration of cefotaxime is equally effective as triple-dose therapy in reducing postcesarean section endometritis.
