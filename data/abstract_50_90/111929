Resistance against ascites tumor development and interferon-inducing activity were demonstrated in lipopolysaccharide derived from the protein-lipopolysaccharide complex obtained from an autolysate of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Lipid A obtained from the lipopolysaccharide was sufficient to induce interferon in vitro but no antitumor activity was found if lipid A or the polysaccharide derived from lipopolysaccharide was injected into the animal. Chemical modification of the polysaccharide portion or deacylation of the lipopolysaccharide also diminished antitumor activity. In contrast, interferon was induced by these incomplete lipopolysaccharides. These results indicate that both the lipid A portion and covalently linked polysaccharide are necessary for the inhibition of ascites tumor development, whereas incomplete lipid A with amide-linked fatty acids is sufficient to induce interferon in vitro.
