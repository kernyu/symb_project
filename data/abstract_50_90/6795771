The sensitivity to 15 drugs of the Peru, Sonya and Y strains of Trypanosoma cruzi was investigated in inbred A/Jax strain mice. Some variation was seen in the percentage of survivors and more still in the survival times of those that died. Marked variation was seen when the two sets of data were analysed together by Litchfield's rapid graphic method for evaluating time-percent effect curves. No one strain, however, was found to be especially drug-sensitive and therefore particularly useful in primary drug screening. Furthermore, the differences in sensitivity were apparently not marked and are unlikely to have clinical significance once an effective drug with a high chemotherapeutic index is discovered for Chagas's disease.
