Progressively expanding area of multiresistant falciparum malaria and the profile of its resistance to drugs successively implemented into practice necessitate the elaboration of approaches to the "revival" of the drugs used. As with neoplastic cells, a correlation between plasmodium multiresistance with increased "outflow" of specific drugs from the cell is suggested, which is blocked by inhibition of Ca2+ transport. Reversion of resistance to chloroquine by a combination with Ca2+ channel blockers verapamil, tricyclic antidepressants (desipramine, protritreline, etc.), tricyclic antihistamine drugs (cyproheptadine), and reversion of resistance to sulfadoxine in combination with the antihistamine drug ketodiphene have been shown in vivo and in vitro. The function of Ca2+ channels is directly related to Ca2(+)-, Mg2(+)-dependent ATPase. Ph-metric techniques elaborated in the USSR make it possible to evaluate its activity, determine the inhibitors, differentiate them according to the effect. The authors have established reversion of P. berghei resistance to chloroquine, with the tricyclic antidepressants azaphen, aminazin, triftazin correlating with the degree of Ca2+, Mg2(+)-ATPase inhibition and to praziquantel, whose effect might be associated with the increased permeability of the cellular membrane to Ca2+. The inhibitors of Ca2+ transport have various parasitocidal activities which might be accounted for by the deficiency of this cation necessary for plasmodium development. The task is to elaborate safe optimum antimalarial drug/modulator of Ca2+ transport combinations. Multiresistance (genetically predetermined multifactorial cellular changes) may be associated with enhanced synthesis of transmembrane glycoprotein with varying molecular mass depending on the direction of resistance.
