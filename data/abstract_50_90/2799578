During the 6-month period July 1987-January 1988, 934 isolates of Haemophilus influenzae were collected from 6 laboratories in Johannesburg. On the basis of counter-immuno-electrophoresis, 30 of the isolates were serotype b, with 9 of 36 (25%) cerebrospinal fluid isolates being type b. Overall, 11.7% of the isolates produced beta-lactamase. The prevalence of resistance based on a disc diffusion test was ampicillin 14%, chloramphenicol 2.3%, cefaclor 4.4%, erythromycin 84.9%, tetracycline 4.7% and co-trimoxazole 9.7%. Problems were encountered with the disc diffusion testing of augmentin- and minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined. The MICs of 40 isolates were compared with their zone diameters. Good correlation between these two methods of antimicrobial susceptibility testing was found with all the antimicrobials tested excluding augmentin (correlation coefficient 0.1234) and cefaclor (correlation coefficient -0.2473).
