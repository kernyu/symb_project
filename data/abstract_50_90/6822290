Bromolasalocid (Ro 20-0006) is a calcium ionophore with antihypertensive activity that does not belong to any known class of antihypertensive agents. Bromolasalocid produces a relatively flat systolic blood pressure dose-response effect in the spontaneously hypertensive rat. An intensive cardiovascular evaluation of bromolasalocid at the highest dose used in the dose-response study showed full hemodynamic compensation; there was a significant decrease in both mean arterial blood pressure and peripheral resistance without a significant decrease in cardiac index. The antihypertensive action of bromolasalocid lasts many days after termination of dosing. Bromolasalocid is specifically antihypertensive and does not decrease arterial blood pressure in normotensive animals or in animal models of hypertensive cardiovascular disease with normal pulse pressures. Bromolasalocid is not a vasodilator and appears to mediate its antihypertensive action by restoring compliance of the large conduit arteries. Both the derived arterial compliance index and the blood pressure-pressor response to the carotid occlusion reflex are enhanced in the dog perinephritis model of hypertensive cardiovascular disease treated with bromolasalocid. Bromolasalocid appears to reverse the damage to cardiovascular tissue caused by prolonged hypertension via an action on calcium perturbations in large artery smooth muscle cells.
