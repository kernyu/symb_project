Using 3H-azidopine, we have succeeded in labeling proteins from chloroquine resistant (CR) human falciparum malaria parasites in the molecular weight range of 155-170 kd. Vinblastine does not compete, but azidopine blocks the labeling using 3H-azidopine. Relatively little or no labeling of the 155-170 kd protein is seen in the chloroquine sensitive strain using 3H-azidopine. Further competition can be seen with nicardipine and reserpine (71%) respectively and verapamil (61%), chloroquine (48%), quinacrine (56%), trifluoperazine (32%) and chlorpromazine (33%). We speculate that this may be the glycoprotein responsible for the resistance to chloroquine in falciparum malaria.
