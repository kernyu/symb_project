The antibacterial activities of Staph. aureus isolated in 1980 and 1981 at all districts in Japan to ABPC, CEZ, CMZ and GM were tested. Numbers of test strains were 587 strains in 1980 and 700 strains in 1981, respectively. The frequencies of ABPC and CEZ resistant strains of Staph. aureus (MIC: greater than or equal to 25 micrograms/ml) were clearly increased in annual variation. The percentage of CEZ resistant strains in 1981 tested by 10(8) CFU/ml inoculum size was 12.3%, but the same of CMZ was only 0.6%.
