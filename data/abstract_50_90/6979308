Carpetimycins A and B showed widely broad spectra and potent activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including various species of anaerobic bacteria. The antimicrobial activity of carpetimycin A was 8 to 64 times greater than that of carpetimycin B and 4 to 128 times greater than that of cefoxitin. The inhibitory concentration of carpetimycin A required to inhibit more than 90% of clinical isolates was 0.39 micrograms/ml for Escherichia coli and klebsiella and 1.56 microgram/ml for Proteus and Staphylococcus aureus. At a concentration of 3.13 micrograms/ml, carpetimycin A inhibited almost all clinical isolates of Enterobacter and Citrobacter, which showed resistance to many clinically used beta-lactam antibiotics. Carpetimycins A and B furthermore were shown to have potent inhibitory activities against several kinds of beta-lactamases produced by beta-lactam-resistant strains; they inhibited not only penicillinase-type beta-lactamases but also cephalosporinase-type beta-lactamases, which were insensitive to clavulanic acid. In combination with beta-lactam antibiotics such as ampicillin, carbenicillin, and cefazolin, carpetimycins A and B showed synergistic activities against beta-lactam-resistant bacteria.
