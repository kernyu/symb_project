From the laboratory and clinical studies on ceftizoxime (CZX), the following results were obtained 1) CZX was compared with cefazolin (CEZ) for in vitro activity against 6 standard strains and clinically isolated strains of Staphylococcus aureus (19 strains), Staphylococcus epidermidis (14), Proteus sp. (17), Escherichia coli (3), Klebsiella sp. (3) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (13). While somewhat less active against Gram-positive cocci than CEZ, CZX was far more active than CEZ against Gram-negative bacilli. 2) The time course of mean serum CZX levels in 2 patients given a single intravenous dose of 10 mg/kg was as follows: 24.9 microgram/ml at 15 minutes, 18.5 microgram/ml at 30 minutes, 13.2 microgram/ml at 1 hour, 6.4 microgram/ml at 2 hours and 2.7 microgram/ml at 4 hours. The mean serum half life was 1.36 hours. The mean tonsil concentrations of CZX 30 minutes after a single intravenous dose of 0.5 g and 1.0 g were 5.9 microgram/g and 9.6 microgram/g. respectively, with the ratio to the serum concentration of 0.33 and 0.32. 3) CZX was given to 28 patients with ear, nose, and throat infections, and overall rate of effectiveness was 92.3%. No clinical side effects were observed. Changes in laboratory test findings included slightly elevated GOT and/or GPT in 3 cases.
