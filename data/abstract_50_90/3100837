The purpose of this study was to determine the susceptibility of Neisseria gonorrhoeae to ciprofloxacin (CPFX). The MIC's of CPFX against 50 clinical isolates of N. gonorrhoeae was examined and they were between less than or equal to 0.003 microgram/ml and 0.006 microgram/ml including 8 beta-lactamase producing strains. The CPFX was administered orally to 3 groups of 10 cases with gonococcal urethritis, groups being determined by 3 dose levels: a group with 200 mg b.i.d. for 3 days (a total of 1,200 mg), another with 400 mg b.i.d. (a total of 800 mg) and the final group with single administration of 400 mg. The effect of CPFX in the 1,200 mg-administered group was excellent in 3 and good in 7. The effect of the drug in the 800 mg-administered group was excellent in 2 and good in 8. The effect in the 400 mg-administered group was all good. Therefore, the overall cure rate was 100% including 5 patients with beta-lactamase producing gonococcic infection. Side effects were not observed in the 30 cases.
