The biological properties of 106 S. typhi cultures were studied; of these, 59 cultures were isolated from 45 chronic carriers and 47 cultures, from 23 typhoid fever patients. According to the degree of their virulence (CPD50 in the continuous cell-line culture Hep-2), the strains isolated from the patients were more virulent than those isolated from the chronic carriers. The mean value of lg CPD50 was 5.76 +/- 0.04 for the patients and 6.86 +/- 0.03 for the chronic carriers. The strains isolated from the patients showed greater variability in the degree of their virulence. The study of the plasmid spectrum showed that 9.4 +/- 5.6% of the strains contained plasmids. From the patients plasmid-containing strains were isolated more frequently than from the carriers (14.9 +/- 2.5% and 5.1 +/- 2.9%). Multiresistance to antibiotics in combination with the presence of plasmids was detected in 6 strains isolated from the typhoid patients with morbidity having the character of outbreaks.
