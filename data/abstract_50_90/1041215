The in vitro susceptibility of 162 anaerobic isolates from clinical material were tested to pencillin G, BL-P1654, and carbenicillin. Penicillin G and BL-P1654 showed good activity against Bacteroides fragilis, but only 60% of strains were susceptible to carbenicillin at achievable blood levels (128 mug/ml).
