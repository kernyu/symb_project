A survey on Salmonella serotypes isolated from livestock, foods of animal origin and surface waters has been performed by the Reference Center for Enterobacteria of Northern Italy in cooperation with the Multi-Regional Veterinary Public Health Laboratories of Northern Italy, and the results were compared with the range of Salmonella isolates from humans. Major differences have resulted in the frequencies of the different serotypes, being Group B serotypes by far less frequently isolated from humans. Nevertheless, S. typhi-murium was the individual serotype prevalent in both sources. A selected group of strains, of either origin, has been tested for chemo-antibiotic resistance, which showed to be more widespread in the non-human strains.
