The combined actions of sisomicin (SISO), gentamicin (GM) and piperacillin (PIPC), cefmetazole (CMZ) against Pseudomonas aeruginosa E-2 and Serratia marcescens T-55 were studied. The following results were obtained. 1. The combinations of SISO-PIPC, SISO-CMZ, GM-PIPC and GM-CMZ using the checker board dilution method on P. aeruginosa E-2 and S. marcescens T-55 were found to have a synergistic effect and the minimum FIC index values were 0.38 in all combinations. 2. With the killing kinetic method, all combinations tested showed a synergistic effect. 3. A synergistic effect of the combinations of SISO-PIPC, SISO-CMZ, GM-PIPC and GM-CMZ was observed in the protective effect on experimental P. aeruginosa E-2 and S. marcescens T-55 infections in mice.
