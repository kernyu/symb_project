Patients suffering from chronic lung infections are a major problems in therapy of cystic fibrosis (CF). Resistance frequently occurs with great rapidity among isolates of Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonal aeruginosa. The rational for the use of frequent antibiotics (reduction of bacterial count), and the principle to follow while using antibiotics in CF patients are discussed. Research on amikacin peak levels and its average levels in serum, saliva and sputum is presented.
