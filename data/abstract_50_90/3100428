In an open prospective study the efficacy and tolerance of imipenem/cilastatin was investigated in 24 critically ill patients on mechanical ventilation with nosocomial respiratory tract infection. Nine patients had previously received antibiotic therapy which had failed. Imipenem was given in a dose of 1-3g/24 h over 5-37 (mean 11) days. Seven patients were additionally treated with aminoglycosides, one patient with erythromycin. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Hemophilus influenzae and Escherichia coli were the most frequently isolated pathogens from tracheobronchial secretions. 91% of the infections without and 77% with involvement of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were successfully treated. All of the gram-positive and 85% of the gram-negative pathogens (Pseudomonas not included) were eliminated in the course of therapy. By contrast, 64% of the isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa persisted; half of these became imipenem-resistant. Nine patients showed adverse reactions including one case of pseudomembranous colitis which were reversible. Imipenem/cilastatin proved highly effective and was relatively well tolerated; limitations in the efficacy were seen in cases of infection due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
