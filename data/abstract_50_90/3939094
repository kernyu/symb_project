Ornithine decarboxylase is a key enzyme in polyamine synthesis and growth of mammalian cells. In this chapter I review recent reports on the purification and properties of the pure enzyme, and on the localization, synthesis and regulation of the enzyme in the cell. The use of monospecific antibodies, radiolabeled irreversible inhibitors and cDNA clones for studying enzyme localization, turnover and regulation, is briefly described. This first part is meant to serve as a basis for the analysis of ornithine decarboxylase as a target of chemotherapy. A selection of the most potent inhibitors of ornithine decarboxylase is presented and the effects of some of these in cell culture, in animals and in the clinical setting are reviewed.
