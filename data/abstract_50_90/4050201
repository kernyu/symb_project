During 1982-83 the frequency of single chemoresistant Salmonella isolates declined compared with the period of 1980-81. This decrease is evident regardless of whether the material is grouped according to serovars or to regions. However, the degree of resistance in multiresistant isolates increased. The frequency of S. saint-paul decreased, but continued to have the highest degree of resistance. In the D1 group there were almost exclusively mono-resistant isolates. 59% of all resistant isolates were resistant to tetracyclin, 47% to streptomycine and 25% to sulfonamides. Sensitive isolates predominate in outbreaks, except for one outbreak of S. enteritidis, which showed a marked percentage of bacteria with reduced sensibility against cephalosporine. The resistance patterns showed considerable variance over the time of observation. All types of resistance appeared much more frequently than expected from calculation of possible gene-bound properties; the only exception was the double resistance to cephalosporine and tetracycline which corresponds with genetic laws.
