The spot-plate method for determining in vitro antibiotic susceptibility is a modified version of the standard tube dilution technique, with the same principle of twofold dilution. Results of the spot-plate method are compared with those of the standard tube dilution technique. It is proposed that the spot-plate method is an equally accurate, but more rapid and economical, technique for determining in vitro antibiotic susceptibility.
