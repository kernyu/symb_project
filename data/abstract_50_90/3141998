We assessed the antiproliferative effects of natural human tumor necrosis factor alpha (nHuTNF-alpha) and natural interferon alpha and gamma (nHuIFN-alpha and -gamma), either alone or in combination, on human lung, colon, breast cancer, leukemia and lymphoma cell lines (PC10, RPMI4788, ZR-75-1, K562 and Daudi). PC10 and ZR-75-1 were minimal sensitive (30-50% inhibition) to nHuTNF-alpha. PC10 and RPMI4788 were sensitive to both nHuIFN-alpha and -gamma. K562 and Daudi were resistant to nHuTNF-alpha and also to nHuIFN-alpha and -gamma at the concentration tested. The combination treatment with nHuTNF-alpha and nHuIFN-alpha or -gamma showed the marked antitumor effects in four cell lines (PC10, RPMI4788, ZR-75-1 and Daudi). Though further investigations using fresh tumors or in vivo experiments need to be conducted, our results may have therapeutic implications.
