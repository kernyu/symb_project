Ejaculated human spermatozoa were studied to assess their nuclear maturity. After SDS or SDS-EDTA treatment, asthenozoospermic semen had a lower resistance to decondensation than normozoospermic semen and contained more stained immature nuclei after aniline blue staining. It showed a higher uptake of ethidium bromide, specific for DNA. There was no difference in the binding of 14C iodoacetamide in the two groups. Therefore, asthenozoospermic semen could be characterized by its relative nuclear immaturity.
