Aminocyclitol resistance in Staphylococcus aureus has been investigated by the analysis of the plasmids and aminocyclitol-modifying enzymes present in several clinical staphylococcal isolates. All of the strains tested were resistant to a broad range of aminocyclitols and contained large plasmids which encoded a variety of aminocyclitol-modifying enzymes in addition to other antibiotic resistances. All strains expressed multiple aminocyclitol-modifying enzymes. The plasmids present in these strains appear to be related by virtue of their similar restriction endonuclease digestion patterns. The plasmids are related and differ by the gain or loss of small DNA segments, one of which encodes erythromycin and kanamycin resistance.
