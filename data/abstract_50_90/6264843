A small, nonconjugative plasmid, designated pBP1, was originally found in different fecal Escherichia coli serotypes isolated from a healthy proband. Of a total number of 130 hospital strains of E. coli subsequently studied, 8.5% yielded plasmid of the pBP1 type. This R plasmid specifies resistance to streptomycin (Sm) and sulfonamides (Su) and has a mass of 4.0 megadaltons. Inactivation of streptomycin is due to the aminoglycoside phosphotransferase APH-(3 "). A physical map was constructed by analysis with restriction endonucleases. Another small plasmid, pBP1-1, was isolated from one of the hospital strains and characterized as an enlarged pBP1 replicon containing an additional deoxyribonucleic acid sequence identified as a transposable element for ampicillin resistance (TnA). Plasmid pBP1-1 was cleaved by restriction enzymes for identification of the transposon sequence which codes for a TEM 1 beta-lactamase. The sequence organizations in the Sm Su plasmids RSF1010 and pBP1 were shown to be identical for regions specifying streptomycin and sulfonamide resistance, but different for the region containing the origin of replication and genes for replicative functions. Thus, RSF1010, which has been considered as the prototype of Sm Su plasmids, and pBP1, which is at least as frequent in clinical isolates as RSF1010, do not have a single common ancestor.
