The minimal inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations for 108 group B streptococcal strains were determined for two new cephalosporins, cefonicid and ceftizoxime, and compared to those of penicillin G. Penicillin G was the most active inhibitory and bactericidal agent. Ceftizoxime was a significantly more active inhibitory and bactericidal agent than cefonicid (P less than 0.0005, P less than 0.025, respectively.
