The battery-operated incubator described in this report is portable, inexpensive, and reliable. Combined with a simple candle-jar desiccator, it can be used for the cultivation of P. falciparum under field conditions. This should promote the use of the in vitro microtechnique for assessing drug susceptibility of malaria parasites, particularly in areas where a conventional source of electricity is not available.
