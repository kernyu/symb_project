Treatment of primary cultured adipocytes with 50 ng/ml insulin and 20 mM glucose for 0-6 h resulted in a loss of maximal insulin responsiveness (MIR) which was immediate (no lag period), rapid (t1/2 of 3 h), linear, and extensive (80% of that seen at 24 h), whereas loss of insulin sensitivity from 0-24 h was slow (t1/2 = 8 h), extensive (insulin ED50 of 0.3 and 1.45 ng/ml at 2 and 24 h, respectively), and was preceded by an initial 2-h lag. Recovery of MIR and insulin sensitivity was assessed by inducing desensitization for various times from 2-24 h, removing insulin and glucose, and then measuring MIR and insulin sensitivity over a subsequent 1-6-h period. After 2 h, recovery of MIR in desensitized cells was rapid (251 pmol of glucose/3 min/h), whereas after 24 h, recovery was much slower (35 pmol/3 min/h). In contrast, the opposite trend was seen for recovery of insulin sensitivity: at early times recovery of insulin sensitivity was slow (0.05 ng/ml/h) but was rapid after 24 h (0.12 ng/ml/h). Thus, it appears that MIR and insulin sensitivity can be independently regulated since recovery rates for MIR and insulin sensitivity diverged with the progression of insulin resistance. When the effects of insulin and glucose on recovery were examined, we found that insulin alone was unable to block recovery of MIR or insulin sensitivity. Glucose alone, however, was effective in preventing recovery of insulin sensitivity but not recovery of MIR. In the presence of 20 mM glucose, low doses of insulin (treatment EC50 = 0.22-0.46 ng/ml) effectively prevented recovery of both MIR and insulin sensitivity. De novo protein synthesis apparently is not involved in the development of insulin resistance or the reversal of desensitization since inhibition of protein synthesis by cycloheximide had no effect on the loss of MIR and insulin sensitivity or recovery.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
