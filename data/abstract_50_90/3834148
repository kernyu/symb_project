Antimicrobial activity of aztreonam (AZT) against 231 clinical isolates in the field of obstetrics and gynecology was determined by agar-plates dilution method. Almost of all strains of E. coli (108 strains) tested were susceptible to the concentration of 0.20 micrograms/ml of AZT. Anaerobic bacteria, however, were less susceptible to this antibiotic than to cefazolin. The concentrations of AZT were determined in serum and pelvic tissue samples obtained at various intervals after 1 hour intravenous drip infusion with 1 g. The concentrations of AZT in pelvic tissues were maximal 9.3 micrograms/g at 57 minutes but less than 0.6 micrograms/g at 3 hours or more after injection. Clinical efficacy of AZT was evaluated in 6 cases consisted of two each with Bartholin's abscess and intrauterine infection and one each with post partum endometritis and acute adnexitis. Clinical efficacies were seen in 5 cases.
