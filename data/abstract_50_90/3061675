An initiative to reduce childhood mortality due to malaria, diarrhoea and vaccine-preventable diseases, called the Africa Child Survival Initiative-Combatting Childhood Communicable Diseases (CCCD) project, was started in 1982 and is now operating in 13 African countries, 12 of which are endemic for malaria. The project's malaria control strategy relies on the use of drugs, mainly chloroquine, to prevent severe illness and death in children less than 5 years of age; chemoprophylaxis for pregnant women is also advised to prevent low birth weight in newborns. The strategy is based on WHO recommendations which focus on improved diagnosis and treatment of cases and chemoprophylaxis for pregnant women.In 9 out of the 13 CCCD countries the sensitivity of Plasmodium falciparum to chloroquine in children was investigated and a drug sensitivity surveillance network was established. In areas with chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum, treatment with chloroquine was found to decrease the temperature in febrile children and to greatly reduce the parasite density, thus preventing severe illness and possible death. Baseline surveys in 6 countries have shown a wide range of treatment practices, e.g., use of chloroquine in various doses without standard guidelines and the excessive use of quinine and chloroquine injections in some health units. As pregnant women are often not taking chemoprophylaxis, research has been started on alternative approaches to drug treatment to prevent the adverse effects of malaria on the fetus.Only 4 of the 12 malarious countries had malaria control units when their CCCD programme began and these were concerned mainly with vector control issues; 11 of 12 countries now have such units and a written CCCD malaria plan. These countries have now integrated malaria control activities into primary health care and have begun to implement standardized treatment and prevention practices that are described in their national CCCD malaria plans.
