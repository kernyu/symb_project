1913 Shigella strains were isolated from 1968 to 1983 in lake Kivu area (Central Africa). Distribution and evolution of serotypes, biotypes and antibiotypes were studied. The majority of serotypes and biotypes were stable. However, few of these strains showed variations, among them Shigella dysenteriae serotype 1, causing epidemic dysenteriae since 1981. Epidemiologic survey of shigellosis in Kivu seems to be rather underdeveloped (4 bacteriology laboratories for an area of 10 million inhabitants) and the number of registered cases is probably underestimated. This problem is threatening the public health and coordination of laboratory activities, either local or regional, should be improved.
