A new generalized transducing bacteriophage in the Escherichia coli system was isolated and characterized. This phage, designated D108, makes clear plaques on E. coli K-10, K-12, K-12(P1kc), K-12(D6), B/r, C, and 15 T(-), and Shigella dysenteriae. The plaque of phage D108 is larger in size than that of phage P1kc. Electron-microscopic observation revealed that phages D108 and P1kc are morphologically different from each other, suggesting that phage D108 belongs to a phage group different from phage P1. The fact that all of the 10 markers tested were transduced by phage D108 indicates that this phage is a generalized transducing phage in the E. coli system. The transduction frequency by phage D108 of chromosomal markers and of a drug resistance factor (R factor) ranged from 2 x 10(-6) to 3 x 10(-8) and 3 x 10(-9) to 6 x 10(-10) per phage, respectively. The cotransduction frequency of the thr and leu markers was 2.8% for phage P1kc and 1.5% for phage D108. The CM and TC markers (chloramphenicol-resistant and tetracycline-resistant markers, respectively) of the R factor were not cotransduced by phage D108, but the markers were generally cotransduced by phage P1kc. The results suggest that the transducing particle of phage D108 contains a smaller amount of host deoxyribonucleic acid than does phage P1kc.
