A 4.8-kilobase-pair plasmid was isolated from the ruminal bacterium selenomonas ruminantium HD4 by using a sodium carbonate-EDTA washing buffer to improve cell lysis (R.G. Dean, S.A. Martin, and C. Carver, Lett. Appl. Microbiol. 8:45-48, 1989). This plasmid, designated pSR1, appears to be quite stable. No evidence of plasmid DNA was detected in S. ruminantium D or GA192. All three strains were tested for antibiotic resistance, and all were kanamycin resistant (MIC, 25 to 50 micrograms/ml). Only strain D was tetracycline resistant (MIC, 25 micrograms/ml), and all strains were sensitive to ampicillin (MIC, 1 microgram/ml). pSR1 was cloned into pBR322, and a map of pSR1 was constructed by using HindIII, ClAI, BamHI, and PvuII. Although ClaI, BamHI, ScaI, and EcoRV digested recombined plasmid isolated from Escherichia coli, these restriction endonucleases were not effective in digesting plasmid isolated directly from S. ruminantium HD4.
