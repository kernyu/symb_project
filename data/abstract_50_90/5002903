A completely automated system for the performance of antibiotic susceptibility tests in the clinical laboratory is described. With a modicum of personnel involvement, data on 40 specimens tested against 13 antibiotics are obtained every hour after an initial 3-hr period. The step by step explanation of the functioning of this prototype system, based on a thoroughly tested manual model, is presented. The system compares well with the standard diffusion test and has a potential for application to other endeavors of the clinical microbiology laboratory with a comparable saving in time and labor.
