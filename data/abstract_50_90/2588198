The authors analysed the results of bacteriological examinations of 600 urine samples with special regard to the sensitivity of the different pathogenic agents to Sumetrolim (400 mg sulphamatoxazole + 80 mg trimethoprim per each tablet). Their observations were also summarized in tables. The effectiveness of Sumetrolim treatment (for 5 days daily 2 x 3 tablets, from the subsequent 10 days daily 2 x 1 tablet) used in 100 chronic prostatitis patients and in 100 patients suffering temporarily from chronic infection (who had undergone prostatectomy) has been analyzed. Sumetrolim has been found to be valuable in the urological practice especially in the treatment of chronic infections of long duration. Teh eventual side-effects of Sumetrolim have been discussed on the basis of references and own observations referring to the treatment of 200 patients. The therapy had to be discontinued in 21 cases, in 1 case because of toxicoderma responding well to therapy, in 3 cases because of mild cutaneous alteration, in 10 cases due to intensive diarrhoea, and in 7 cases because of other side-effects.
