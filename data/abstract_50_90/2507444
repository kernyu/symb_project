We have analyzed the priming process of Listeria-specific T cells using an in vitro primary culture system. Listeria-specific T cells mediating delayed footpad reaction (DFR) and acquired cellular resistance (ACR) upon passive local transfer into naive recipients were generated from non-immune mouse spleen cells when stimulated with viable Listeria monocytogenes primarily in vitro. The effectors were detected on the third day of culture, and culturing for 5 days was sufficient for the generation of effectors mediating the peak level of DFR and ACR. The requirement of T cell subsets, Ia antigen and interleukin 2 (IL 2) for inducing effectors was studied. Presence of macrophages (M phi) and their contact to T cells were required for priming of Listeria-specific T cells in vitro. The presence of Ia antigens on macrophages was absolutely required for priming, but this requirement was lower than that in secondary immune response of Listeria-specific T cells. Effectors could not be generated when L3T4+ cells were depleted, but effectors capable of conferring a full level of DFR and ACR were induced even after the depletion of Lyt2+ cells. Contribution of IL 2 to the generation of effectors during early phase of priming was not observed. IL 2 was not produced in the supernatant of the in vitro primary culture. Precursor cells of the effectors did not respond to exogenously added recombinant IL 2 (rIL 2). Some mechanisms operating in the induction phase of Listeria-specific T cells were clarified in this study.
