Sensitivity of 167 strains of beta-hemolytic streptococci of group A was studied with the method of serial dilutions on a solid agar medium for cultivation of streptococci. The medium was developed at the I. I. Mechnikov Research Institute of Vaccines and Sera. It does not require addition of blood or serum. The strains were found to be highly sensitive to penicillin, cephalothin and erythromycin. The number of the strains resistant to tetracycline, streptomycin, gentamycin, levomycetin (chloramphenicol) and ristomycin amounted to 51, 36, 23, 1.8 and 1.8 per cent, respectively. One of the strains (0.6 per cent) was resistant to lincomycin. Strains with multiple resistance were isolated. The necessity of regular control of distribution of antibiotic resistance among staphylococci is indicated.
