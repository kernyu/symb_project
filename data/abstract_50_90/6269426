Cefotaxime is a cephalosporin active against most gram-positive and gram-negative organisms, including streptococci, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacteriaceae, Proteus, and many Pseudomonas and Bacteroides fragilis--all but the latter two are inhibited at concentrations below 0.5 micrograms/ml. We evaluated cefotaxime as the sole therapy for 32 infections in 31 patients. Infection sites included 18 bacteremias; pulmonary, urinary tract, deep tissue infections; and meningitis. Clinical cures were achieved in 88 percent and bacteriologic cures in 86 percent of the patients--including those with infections due to organisms resistant to cephalosporins, chloramphenicol, carbenicillin and aminoglycosides; and in two patients with meningitis due to multiresistant Klebsiella pneumoniae. Serum and cerebrospinal levels were readily maintained above the inhibitory levels of susceptible organisms. Adverse reactions were minimal. Cefotaxime was a safe, effective antibiotic in the treatment of infections due to susceptible organisms, including those resistant to other agents.
