A line of Eimeria maxima acquired resistance to Lerbek (a mixture of clopidol and methyl benzoquate) after serial passage against rising drug levels. Abnormal bisporocystic oocysts which appeared throughout this series were picked out individually and these produced infections in further groups of chicks. Serial passages of selected bisporocystic forms raised their proportion in oocyst yields to about 80% after 10-14 passages, but a few normal oocysts were still present.
