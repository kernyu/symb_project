S-6436 was orally given to the patients mainly with uncomplicated acute cystitis at two divided doses for 7 days with the following results: 1) One or 2g/day of S-6436 were administered to the patients with 93.7% of effectiveness. There is almost no difference in effectiveness between 1 g and 2g dosages. 2) Bacteria in urine disappeared in 74% of the patients treated and superinfection occurred in 22%. The disappearance of the bacteria was observed in 83.3% of the patients with E. coli and 60% with Staph. epidermidis. The superinfection however was observed in 16.5% with E. coli and 33.3% with Staph. epidermidis. The disappearance of bacteria was observed in each one case with Klebsiella, Staph. aureus and Ps. aeruginosa. The superinfection was observed in 2 cases with Proteus. 3) Sensitivity tests on the organisms indicated that 94.4% of E. coli, 40% of Staph. epidermidis, Klebsiella and Staph. aureus were susceptible to the drug but Proteus and Ps. aeruginosa were not susceptible. 4) No remarkable side effects were observed, though digestive was used in several patients. From the above results, S-6436 is considered to be a useful drug which is expected to have as much effectiveness as regular cephalexin at two divided doses after breakfast and dinner.
