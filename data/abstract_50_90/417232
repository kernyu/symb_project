The synergistic effect of combinations of gentamicin and carbenicillin, as well as the type or subtype of the pyocins produced, were investigated in 170 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from clinical specimens. A high proportion of strains were synergistically inhibited (73.5%), but among strains producing pyocins 7, 14 and 31, synergy was infrequent or absent. The synergistic effect was more frequent upon gentamicin- or carbenicillin-susceptible strains. However, among untypable strains, synergy was more frequent among gentamicin-resistant strains. Susceptibility to both gentamicin and carbenicillin must be considered if antibiotic susceptibility is to be related to synergy.
