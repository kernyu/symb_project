Streptococcus sanguis (serogroups H and W) strains are frequently competent in genetic transformation. In a collection of 18 strains of S. sanguis isolated from blood cultures, 12 strains were spontaneously competent in transformation by streptomycin-resistant DNA, and three strains were induced to competence by the use of culture filtrates containing competence factor (CF). Culture filtrates from spontaneously competent S. sanguis strains only induced competence in transformation of strains of the same species. In addition to the three "constitutional" types of S. sanguis with regard to specificity of transformation previously reported (originally represented by the strain Challis, 13b and NCTC 7863), a possible fourth type, (represented by strain 21452) was found. Further studies are required to ascertain the role of these types. The "constitutional" types are characterized by the range of activity of their CF's. These specificities seem useful in identification of S. sanguis and its separation from S. mitis (mitior). Tests of spontaneously competent strains with culture filtrates from other competent strains showed variable effects on the transformation frequencies in different strains.
