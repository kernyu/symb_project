Levorin added to nutrient media with growing cultures of aerobic gram-positive bacilli, Escherichia, enterococci and filamentous fungi was partially inactivated. The antibiotic activity decrease depended on the strain characteristics, incubation period and temperature. Fermentation broth filtrates of the experimental strains also inactivated levorin while to a lesser extent than the growing organisms. In contaminated levorin pastes, the antibiotic activity was lower. The fermentative nature of inactivation was not proved.
