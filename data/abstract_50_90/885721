Cutaneous infection due to bacteria are predominantly caused by staphylococci. The sensitivity of 1036 staphylococcal strains towards various topical and systemical antibiotics was investigated over a period of three years (1973-1975). Comparing the present results with results from previous investigations revealed that staphylococcal sensitivity towards common antibiotic drugs remained nearly unchanged. A comparatively high proportion of strains has acquired resistance against multiple antibiotics. The importance of routinely determining bacterial sensitivity in antibiotic therapy is emphasized.
