There are currently four major options for control of ostertagiasis and other ruminant gastrointestinal parasites. These are the traditional, suppressive, integrated and strategic approaches. Strategic dosing is the most realistic and beneficial approach for most regions of the world, including the U.S.A. It is effective, practical, labor-saving and can yield big economic returns. Today this approach is even more appropriate because of important advances in the technology of controlled release and pulse-release devices. Top priority in worm control programs should be given to dairy replacement heifers in their first year at pasture and to beef calves in the immediate post-weaning period. This is preferable to recommendations for blanket treatment of all beef and dairy cattle, regardless of age, immune status or pasture infectivity. An anthelmintic overkill is both wasteful and potentially harmful in that it increases the selection pressure for drug resistance. It is suggested that better dissemination of information is needed to make producers aware of the benefits of strategic dosing programs. This would eliminate much of the confusion about parasite control and focus attention on simple and effective programs that could significantly reduce current losses to the livestock industries.
