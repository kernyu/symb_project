Fortimicin A microdilution tests and disk diffusion tests (10-, 30-, and 50-micrograms disks) were performed with 454 selected bacterial strains. Tests with 30-micrograms disks were preferred, with zone standards of less than or equal to 14 mm of resistant strains (minimal inhibitory concentration, greater than 16 micrograms/ml) and greater than or equal to 17 mm for susceptible strains (minimal inhibitory concentration, less than 16 micrograms/ml).
