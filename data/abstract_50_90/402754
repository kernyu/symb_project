There was shown a difference in the biological properties and the ultrastructure of two strains of brucellae, spheroplasts obtained from them under the action of penicillin, L-form and revertants obtained from the L-form. Spheroplasts formation was characterized by a change of brucellae into R-form and some virulence reduction. The cells had an outer and a cytoplasmic membranes, and usually lost their capacity to binary division. L-forms were obtained during the 9th and the 35th passage on a medium with penicillin; their formation was accompanied by the change in serological properties of the culture and significant reduction of the virulence; the cells were characterized by a marked polymorphism and the capacity to budding; they had 2 membranes on the cell surface and an intensively developed system of intracytoplasmic membranes. The revertants formed on the medium without penicillin during the 16th-30th passage or spontaneously on the medium with penicillin. They differed from the initial strains of brucella culture by a marked increase in penicillin-resistance, by the changes in serological properties, and also by polymorphism of cells, capable, however, of binary division.
