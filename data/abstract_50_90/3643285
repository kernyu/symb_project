To investigate the clinical and bacteriological usefulness of orally administered midecamycin acetate (MOM), the susceptibility of clinical isolates to MOM, Mb-12 (the main metabolite of MOM), josamycin (JM), ampicillin (ABPC) and cephalexin (CEX) was determined. The results are summarized as follows. Antibacterial activities of MOM against aerobic Gram-positive cocci, B. catarrhalis, and anaerobic bacteria were inferior to those of JM by 2-fold, but superior to those of CEX. Activities of MOM against S. aureus, Bacteroides spp., Fusobacterium spp., Veillonella spp. were superior to those of ABPC and CEX. Since serum and tissue concentrations of Mb-12 after 200 mg administration in humans have been reported to be 1-2 micrograms/ml, it can be presumed that the causative bacteria would be eradicated by a usual dosage of MOM used in the present study. From these considerations, it is speculated that MOM may be successfully used in the treatment of dental and oral surgical infections.
