The antimicrobial action of beta-ursolic acid (triterpenoid sapogenin from the ursan group) has been studied. At the concentration of 300 mug/ml, this substance inhibited growth of all strains of staphylococci investigated. MIC for Gram-positive bacteria ranged between 50 and 500 mug/ml, and 100 to 800 mug/ml for Gram-negative bacteria and yeasts. Acquired resistance to beta-ursolic acid was transient.
