The relation between the amount of cortex, measured as total hexosamine, as diaminopimelic acid and as muramic lactam, and the heat resistance of spores of five different strains of Bacillus stearothermophilus was studied. Electron micrographs of thin sections of the spores were made to relate the structure of the spores to chemical and thermal characteristics. It was found that the amount of the cortex was significantly related to heat resistance of the spores. Strains with more electron-dense and better organized cortices were found to express higher heat resistance.
