Coresistance to macrolide, lincosamide, and streptogramin B-type (MLS) antibiotics by a common biochemical mechanism characterizes clinically resistant pathogens. Of 10 streptomycetes tested for resistance to macrolide, lincosamide, and streptogramin B-type antibiotics, only 1, Streptomyces erythreus, the organism used for production of erythromycin, was found resistant to all three classes; moreover, it was the only streptomycete in the series tested found to contain N6-dimethyladenine (m62A) in 23S ribosomal ribonucleic acid, the structural alteration of ribosomal ribonucleic acid associated with clinical resistance. Of the seven streptomycetes tested for the presence of m62A and N6-methyladenine (m6A), two, S. fradiae and S. cirratus, which produce the macrolide antibiotics tylosin and cirramycin, respectively, were found to contain m6A, but not m62A. The remaining strains tested, including strains which produce lincomycin and streptogramins, contained neither m6A nor m62A.
