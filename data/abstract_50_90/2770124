A report is given on two children suffering from meningitis caused by ampicillin- and chloramphenicol-resistent Haemophilus influenzae. Since effective therapy has been started with delay, recovery was affected with complications. The need for the early determination of minimal inhibitory concentrations and detection of beta-lactamase-production is emphasized as well as for repeated measurement of C-reactive protein in serum. Cefotaxime is recommended in case of presence of resistent Haemophilusstrains.
