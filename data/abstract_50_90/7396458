Minimal inhibitory concentrations of eight antibiotics were determined for 159 clinical isolates of members of the Bacteroides fragilis group using the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards proposed agar dilution reference method. Isolates were identified by standard techniques with deoxyribonucleic acid homolog confirmation. These closely related species demonstrated differences in susceptibility to commonly used drugs.
