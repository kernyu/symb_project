Trials were conducted to determine the in vivo transferability of plasmid-mediated antibiotic resistance between two strains of enteric Gram-positive bacteria. Germ-free mice were associated with the donor Lactobacillus reuteri DSM 20016 strain, carrying the broad host range pAM beta 1 plasmid, and with the Enterococcus faecalis JH2SS recipient strain. Analysis of faecal content of associated mice demonstrated that the in vivo transfer of this plasmid did occur and that frequencies of conjugation were affected by the presence of subtherapeutic levels of antibiotic in the diet.
