Orthophenylphenol (OPP), a widely used fungicide, induced ouabain-resistant (OuaR) mutants in a ultraviolet (UV)-sensitive human RSa cell strain and the frequencies increased in a dose-related fashion. OPP was a more potent mutagen than UV at doses related to equal survival. These results suggest that OPP has a mutagenic activity and that further experiments on this chemical are warranted.
