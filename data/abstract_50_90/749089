The effect of changes in genetic constitution (associated with developing benzimidazole resistance) on the physiological characteristics of Haemonchus contortus was investigated. Benzimidazole resistant H contortus were significantly more infective for sheep (20 per cent) than benzimidazole susceptible strains. Pathological changes were more severe in sheep infected with resistant H contortus as measured by packed cell volume, plasma protein concentration and haemoglobin levels. Faecal egg output was significantly higher for resistant strains as was the development and survival of eggs and free-living stages on pasture. Infective third stage larvae of benzimidazole resistant H contortus had a significantly faster exsheathment rate in rumenal fluid than did susceptible strains. These adaptive changes in response to continuing anthelmintic selection of resistant worm populations are discussed and the implications of these findings for worm control programmes indicated.
