Coumermycin A1, an antibiotic related to novobiocin, inhibited nucleic acid synthesis in intact Escherichia coli with replication being slightly more sensitive to this drug than transcription. The ultraviolet-induced repair synthesis of DNA was only partially inhibited under conditions where replication was eliminated by coumermycin A1. Inhibition of protein synthesis was a secondary effect. Coumermycin A1-resistant E. coli were isolated and the mutation was mapped near dnaA. Chromatography of crude protein extracts of sensitive and resistant bacteria on drug affinity columns implicated a soluble protein of approximately 37,000 molecular weight as the target site for coumermycin A1. Depending on the medium used, this antibiotic had either a bacteriocidal or a bacteriostatic effect on E. coli. Results showed that the effect of coumermycin A1 cannot be explained by the degradation of DNA under bacteriocidal growth conditions.
