A plasmid vector for cloning in Bacillus sphaericus 1593 was constructed in B. subtilis from two parent plasmids, pBC16 and pBD64. When characterized, the 3.9-MDa chimeric plasmid pNN101 was found to consist of the MspI fragment containing the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene from pBD64 inserted into an MspI site in pBC16. pNN101 was shown to replicate, express, and be stably maintained in B. sphaericus 1593 without affecting the mosquito larvicidal activity of this organism. A derivative of this plasmid, pNN302, was constructed in which a unique HindIII site was introduced into the CAT gene without loss of chloramphenicol resistance.
