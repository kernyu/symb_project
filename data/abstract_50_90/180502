The efficacy of the turkey herpesvirus (HVT) vaccine in protecting chickens challenged with virulent Marek's disease (MD) virus was unaffected by the presence of either the chick embryo fowl pox vaccine or fowl pox vaccine derived from cell culture. Conversely the HVT vaccine did not affect the efficacy of the fowl pox vaccine in chickens challenged with pathogenic fowl pox virus. A combination of spectinomycin dihydrochloride pentahydrate and lincomycin hydrochloride monohydrate as well as spectinomycin sulfate tetrahydrate were found to be compatible with the HVT and fowl pox vaccines as demonstrated by resistance after challenge with virulent MD virus or fowl pox virus.
