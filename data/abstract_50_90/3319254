In vitro sensitivity of P. falciparum to chloroquine and quinine was studied in Hevecam rubber plantations of la Nyete in Cameroon, located at 45 km in the south east of Kribi in a forest area. More than half of the isolates studied (14/25) were resistant to chloroquine (EC50 greater than 80 nmole/l). The mean EC50 and EC99 were 113 nmole/l and 4,110 nmole/l respectively. The sensitivity to quinine was decreased, as compared to other area of the country. Kribi is the third area of chloroquine-resistance known in Cameroon.
