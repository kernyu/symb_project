A series of closed circular (I) plasmid DNAs has been derived from drug resistance factor R12, and the nicked circular (II) and linear (III) derivatives of these molecules prepared by irradiation in the presence of ethidium bromide and by treatment with restriction enzyme EcoRI, respectively. These DNAs encompass the molecular weight range 3.6 to 61 megadaltons. The base compositions range from 45% to 51% (GC) as estimated by buoyant density determinations. The smaller plasmids are significantly less supercoiled (9-10%) than are the larger (12-13%). The gel electrophoretic behavior of the three DNA structural forms was determined as a function of molecular weight in agarose gels of concentrations ranging from 0.7% to 1.6% and at electrophoresis salt concentrations from 0.02 M to 0.08 M sodium acetate. The mobilities of DNAs I and III undergo a reversal relative to each other at a molecular weight which decreases with increasing agarose gel concentration. The molecular weight at which DNA II fails to enter a gel depends upon the ionic strength during electrophoresis but not upon the gel concentration.
