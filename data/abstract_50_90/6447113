Two genes (arg-3 and arp-6) marked by arginine auxotrophy and a gene (sac-2) marked by resistance to serum killing were found to be linked by cotransformation. Evidence derived from the linkage of these markers to spc (spectinomycin resistance) suggests that sac-2 may be genetically distinct from a sac gene previously described.
