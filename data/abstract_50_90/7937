The dynamics of interaction of complexes of synthetic polynucleotides (polyinosinic and polycitidylic acid--poly (rI)-poly (rC), and polyguanylic and polycytidylic acid--poly (rG)-poly (rC)) with cells as well as the dynamics of interferon accumulation and development of antiviral effect against some RNA viruses were studied in primary chick embryo cell (CEC) cultures. Four phases were observed in the development of the antiviral effect of synthetic polynucleotides: adsorption, increase, marked antiviral effect and waning. The duration and extent of the antiviral effect depended upon the activity and the dose of the preparation and less so upon virus type. At the same time, the dynamics of the development of the antiviral effect in early stages differed significantly depending on the virus model.
