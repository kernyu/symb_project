Uptake of gentamicin by a gentamicin-resistant strain of Staphylococcus aureus possessing the aminoglycoside-modifying phosphotransferase enzyme APH(2") was enhanced by the protein synthesis inhibitor, puromycin or by the proton-translocating ATPase inhibitor, N,N'-dicylohexylcarbodiimide. Such enhanced uptake was inhibited by carbonyl cyanide p trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone or by valinomycin in the presence of potassium ions, suggesting a role for the transmembrane proton motive force in the process. The accumulated gentamicin did not cause loss of cell viability and exhibited altered chromatographic mobility compared with a control (unmodified) preparation of gentamicin.
