A series of 178 strains of Escherichia coli, highly resistant to trimethoprim, isolated from hospital patients and patients in the community between 1979 and 1983, was examined for the presence of Tn7 on a plasmid or on the chromosome only, by transposition to RP4 and restriction endonuclease digestion with Hind III. Of the isolates, 57% carried Tn7. Comparison of hospital isolates from 1979 to 1980 and 1982 showed that although the proportions that carried Tn7 were similar (63% and 57%) there had been a significant change in the genetic location of the transposon. The proportion of plasmid-mediated Tn7 had fallen from 62% to 30% with a corresponding rise in Tn7 located exclusively on the chromosome from 38% to 70%. This change may be the result of continuing transposition of Tn7 from plasmids to the bacterial chromosome followed by plasmid loss. The consequent reduction in the mobility of trimethoprim-resistance genes may in turn lead to changes in the incidence of resistance.
