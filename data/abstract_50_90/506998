By use of an agardilution technic, 1,881 clinical isolates were tested against cefamandole and cephalothin. The isolates represented 18 genera, recovered in five geographically separate centers within the United States. The majority of strains were susceptible (MICs less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml) to both drugs. Cefamandole showed greater activity against most of the bacterial pathogens. Enterococci, Serratia spp., and Acinetobacter spp. were resistant to both drugs. Cephalothin was more active against Staphylococcus aureus, and both cephalosporins were relatively inactive against methicillin-resistant strains of S. aureus. Enterobacter spp. and indole-positive Proteus spp. were susceptible to cefamandole but resistant to cephalothin.
