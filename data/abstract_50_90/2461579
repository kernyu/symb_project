Alveolar II pulmonary tumor cells (A549), maintained in continuous tridimensional organotypic culture, were used in an attempt to investigate whether there could be a relationship of the 2',5'-oligoadenylate (2,5A) synthetase pathway to the antiproliferative activity of interferons (IFNs) in this particular tumor cell model. IFN-alpha 2, -beta and -gamma were used separately and in combinations. IFN-alpha 2 and -gamma demonstrated an inhibitory effect on the nodule growth, whereas IFN-beta did not. Moreover, combinations of IFN-alpha 2 and -gamma resulted in a significant synergistic antiproliferative activity; IFN-beta only potentiated slightly the effect of IFN-gamma. All three IFNs induced an increase in the 2,5A synthetase activity, indicating a discrepancy with the pattern of anticellular activity. Furthermore, whereas the combination of IFN-alpha 2 and -gamma resulted in a synergistic antiproliferative effect, no synergism was observed in the induction of the enzyme. These results show that there is a lack of correlation between the sensitivity or the resistance to IFNs of A549 tumor nodules and the induction of the 2,5A synthetase activity.
