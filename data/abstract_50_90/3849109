Antibiotic treatment of infectious peritonitis was evaluated in 97 primary episodes registered among 66 patients treated with chronic intermittent peritoneal dialysis over a 3-year period. 87% of the cases could be treated with antibiotics of low toxicity. The chance of continuing peritoneal dialysis after treatment of peritonitis was better among out-patients than among hospitalized patients. The overall continuance rate was 90%. Relapse of the primary infection occurred in 10% of the cases and was associated with a treatment duration shorter than 2 weeks. Superinfection occurred in 5% of the cases. In 15% the dialysis catheters had to be replaced, due primarily to problems of dialysis technique. Death during active peritonitis occurred in 4% of the cases and was associated with severe underlying diseases or complications, such as intestinal perforation and intraperitoneal abscess formation. Side effects attributable to antibiotic treatment occurred in 13% of the cases, the most common side effect being self-limiting diarrhoea.
