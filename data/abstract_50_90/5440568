The effect of the aerosol inhalation of 200 mug. of salbutamol and 1,000 mug. of isoprenaline on spirometry and blood-gas tensions was compared in the same 11 asthmatic subjects. Both drugs significantly reduced airway obstruction, and the extent of the reduction did not differ for periods of up to 30 minutes. After isoprenaline tachycardia and a small significant fall in arterial oxygen tension occurred, whereas after salbutamol there was no change in pulse rate and the arterial oxygen tension did not fall.
