The isolation of Yersinia enterocolitica from humans in Brazil has never been described before. The present report describes the isolation of an Y. enterocolitica isolate from a patient with clinical symptoms resembling appendicitis. The isolate showed typical sensitivity to the drugs and biochemical tests, with the exception of the motility at 22 degrees C, that was negative. The strain agglutinated with antisera 03 and the patient's serum showed an antibody titer of 1:80 against Y. enterocolitica serotype 03.
