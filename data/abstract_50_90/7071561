In 1979 a three-month multicentre study of resistance of bacteria isolated from humans and animals was carried out in Switzerland with the participation of 22 institutes and laboratories. A total of 23,852 antibiograms were evaluated concerning the following bacteria: Escherichia coi, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella sp., Serratia marcescens, Proteus (indole-negative), Proteus (indole-positive), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and enterococci (streptococci of Group D). 95.5% of the strains were isolated from human material, almost half being isolated from urine. The remaining 4.5% were obtained from animal material, more than half being isolated from the milk of cows with mastitis. Although the various institutes and laboratories did not use a uniform, standardized method, the results are closely in line with those of similar studies carried out earlier in Switzerland, Germany, Austria and the USA. No pronounced trend in the direction of increased resistance is observable.
