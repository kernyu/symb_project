The results were analysed, of the results obtained by the associated treatment with rifampicin and etambutol 2/7 for at least 6 months in 53 patients with silico-tuberculosis and positive bacteriologic tests. Only two of the patients in the group were in the 1-st stage of silicosis while half of the patients had cavities. Also 50% of the patients had strains showing resistance to various drugs. Only five of the patients did not receive chemotherapy before the start of the study. Immediate favourable bacteriological results were noted in 84.9% of the cases and late positive results represented 54.7%, while radiologic improvement was noted in 33.9% of the cases. The percentage of good results was higher in patients without cavities but it was not influenced by the stage of silicosis development.
