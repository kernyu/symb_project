The effects of and recovery from luminal ethanol (0%-100%) were assessed in the in vitro chambered frog gastric mucosa. At concentrations of 5%-10%, the potential difference decreased during exposure, but recovered after washout. No gross or light microscopic changes were observed. During exposure to 20%-40% ethanol, potential difference and short circuit current decreased and resistance increased, with only partial recovery after removal of the alcohol. Acid secretion ceased at 20% ethanol and alkalinization of the luminal solution was observed at greater than or equal to 30% ethanol. Microscopy of this group showed discharge of mucus, separation of oxynticopeptic cells from the basal lamina, and slough of surface epithelium. At 60%-100% ethanol, potential difference and short circuit current decreased and resistance increased markedly but there was no recovery. Microscopy showed changes similar to those of the intermediate group (20%-40%), except that surface epithelial cells were fixed to the basal lamina rather than sloughing. The morphologic effects of 100% ethanol in vivo were similar to those in vitro. Pretreatment with 10(-5) M 16,16-dimethyl prostaglandin E2 did not prevent either the electrophysiologic or the histologic changes caused by 20% and 30% ethanol. We conclude that there is a gross discrepancy between the functional and morphologic findings after high concentrations of luminal ethanol.
