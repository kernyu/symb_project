The R plasmid pJH1 contains a 5.1-kilobase transposon ( Tn3871 ) that mediates inducible resistance to erythromycin. Three AvaI digestion fragments from this transposon are identical in size to and homologous with three AvaI-derived fragments from the previously described erythromycin resistance transposon Tn917 . These three DNA fragments account for greater than 90% of both transposons.
