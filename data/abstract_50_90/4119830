One hundred eighty Escherichia coli strains isolated from raw and cooked dressed beef and from healthy humans were screened for resistance to each of nine antibiotics: chlortetracycline, ampicillin, chloramphenicol, kanamycin, neomycin, nalidixic acid, dihydrostreptomycin, oxytetracycline, and tetracycline. Nearly 80% of the 98 beef isolates and 54% of the 82 human isolates were resistant to one or more of the antibiotics tested. Ampicillin resistance was most frequent among beef isolates, and dihydrostreptomycin resistance was most frequent among isolates of human origin. About 74% of the multiply resistant beef strains and 85% of the multiply resistant human strains transferred all or part of their resistance to E. coli K-12 recipients.
