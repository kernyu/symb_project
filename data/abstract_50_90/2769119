Agar dilution technique susceptibility test of isolated Bacteroides fragilis from the normal healthy women's and infected gynecological patients' cervical areas were studied with current antimicrobial agents. Among the N H W group, imipenem had the lowest MIC90 while cefoxitin had the highest value. Metronidazole, chloramphenicol, imipenem and piperacillin had differentiated-lower values of MIC90 and MIC90 than the others. In the I G P group, imipenem also had the lowest value of MIC90 while benzylpenicillin had the highest value. The different values of MIC90 and MIC50 less than "1" were seen in metronidazole, chloramphenicol and imipenem. The significant role of MIC90 and MIC50 was discussed in this article. Although the isolated strains had beta-lactamase enzymes, the antimicrobials resistances were not correlated with the specific enzymes. Also in this article, the significant role of anaerobic component in mixed infection was also discussed.
