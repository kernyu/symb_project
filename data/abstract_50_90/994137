The organisms responsible for clinical mastitis in dairly herds around Bulawayo were identified and their antibiotic sensitivity was determined. Streptococci, staphylococci and coliforms were responsible for 37%, 28% and 29,5% of cases respectively. Antibiotic resistance increased over the 3 year period. The high incidence of coliform mastitis is discussed, as is the effect of dry cow therapy on peri-natal mastitis and the nature of the scheme of control. The laboratory is considered an essential adjunct to other control methods.
