Thirty isolates of Eimeria tenella obtained from broiler and breeder farms were examined for their sensitivity to anticoccidial drugs. All were sensitive to robenidine, 28 were sensitive to methyl benzoquate, 25 to clopidol and 21 to nicarbazin. Most isolates were resistant or partly resistant to amprolium and dinitolmide.
