Moxalactam demonstrated marked activity against beta-lactamase-positive and -negative Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Neisseria meningitidis by both standard minimal inhibitory concentration testing and growth curve studies. Moxalactam was ineffective against S. pneumoniae partially susceptible to penicillin G. Moxalactam (5 micrograms/ml) and penicillin (1 microgram/ml) in combination were indifferent to each other's antibacterial activity, exerting neither synergism nor antagonism against these organisms.
