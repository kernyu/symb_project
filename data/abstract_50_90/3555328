When cephalexin and erythromycin were administered intragastrically with intervals, adhesion of facultative pathogenic bacteria such as Klebsiella, Staphylococcus and E. coli to enterocytes of the small intestine in vitro was more pronounced than with their continuous administration with drinking water. The adhesive capacity of the staphylococcal strains resistant to the antibiotics was higher than that of the sensitive ones.
