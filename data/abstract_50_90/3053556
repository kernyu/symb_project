The selection of aminoglycoside-resistant bowel flora, following the administration of either gentamicin or netilmicin in combination with metronidazole for prophylaxis, during colo-rectal surgery in 88 patients has been examined. Both antibiotic regimens resulted in the selection of an aminoglycoside-resistant flora in a total of 57 (65%) of patients: in half of the patients there was a net gain in the aminoglycoside-resistant flora, and in 13 (15%) one aminoglycoside-resistant strain present prior to prophylaxis was displaced by another following operation. Three patients (3%) lost aminoglycoside-resistant strains after prophylaxis. Most of the resistant organisms selected were considered to be of little importance as potential pathogens, at least in the short term. In only a small minority (5%) of patients were aminoglycoside-resistant enterobacteria isolated. Aminoglycoside-resistant Staphylococcus aureus was not isolated. Of the resistant enterobacteria, only one strain, an isolate of Enterobacter cloacae selected in a patient receiving gentamicin, carried a resistance determinant which was self-transmissible to Escherichia coli.
