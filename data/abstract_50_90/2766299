Development of resistance to hormonal therapy in breast cancer is frequently associated with a decline or loss of cellular estrogen receptors. Agents which up-regulate the receptor may reduce the incidence of hormonal resistance. Antiestrogens at concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 1 microM produced a 2- to 4-fold increase of estrogen receptors in MCF-7 and T-47D breast cancer cells. This increase, which occurred as early as 3 h and was sustained throughout the 4 days of continuous exposure to tamoxifen, was primarily due to an enhancement in receptor synthesis.
