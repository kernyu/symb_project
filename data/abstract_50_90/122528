Against sulbenicillin- and gentamicin-susceptible strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, SCE-129 was about 10 times more active than sulbenicillin and had a similar activity to gentamicin and dibekacin. Sulbenicillin-resistant strains of P. aeruginosa were moderately resistant to SCE-129, whether these strains were gentamicin-resistant or not. Gentamicin-resistant strains of P. aeruginosa were resistant to dibekacin but not to SCE-129. Against P. maltophilia, the minimum inhibitory concentration of SCE-129 resembled those of sulbenicillin, gentamicin, and dibekacin. Most strains of P. cepacia were moderately resistant to SCE-129 and sulbenicillin and highly resistant to gentamicin and dibekacin.
