The pathogenicity level of antibiotic sensitive and streptomycin resistant strains of S. typhimurium, S. paratyphi B and S. kottbus changed under the effect of identical R plasmids more frequently in contrary directions. The conjugative plasmids of antibiotic resistance widened the ranges of the virulence changes in the Salmonella serovars for albino mice. It was found that 7 out of 8 plasmids studied significantly decreased and increased the virulence of the antibiotic sensitive Salmonella strains. As a rule, R plasmids of various origin decreased the virulence of all the tested streptomycin chromosome resistant causative agents of salmonellosis.
