A nation-wide survey has been carried out in Poland into the susceptibility of six genera of bacteria to eight antibiotics. The antibiotic-resistance of streptococci differed from that of the Gram-negative rods studied.Escherichia coli, Klebsiella and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are known to be completely resistant to penicillin. Streptococcus faecalis was much more resistant to antibiotics than Streptococcus viridans (highest resistance to streptomycin - 90.3% and 74.9%, respectively; least resistance to chloramphenicol - 47.3% and 9.1%). More than 90% of all Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains isolated were resistant to all the antibiotics; high resistance was also exhibited by E. coli (94.5% resistant to erythromycin and 59.5% to chloramphenicol), Proteus (92.3% to penicillin and 63.0% to chloramphenicol) and Klebsiella (84.0% to erythromycin and 62.8% to oxytetracycline).
