The bioavailability of sIgA and lysozyme from human milk was investigated in a total of 41 infants by radial immunodiffusion and by the Micrococcus lysodeicticus method, respectively. In four different pools of human milk used for balance studies the sIgA concentrations ranged between 2,200 and 17,850 mg/l. The lysozyme concentration varied from 64.5 to 283.5 mg/l. On human milk feeding the excretion of sIgA in 19 infants was 3,200 (0-8,200) mg per litre and 9.7 (0-131) mg lysozyme per litre, respectively. Corresponding values on formula feeding in 22 infants were 1030 (0-6400) and 2.6 (0-9) mg/l. Fecal sIgA excretion was significantly higher on human milk than on formula feeding. Balances of sIgA and lysozyme intake and excretion as performed in 9 infants revealed a less than 1% fecal excretion of both the protective substances. In vitro digestion of raw human milk with pepsin at pH 2 and 3 resulted in a rapid disappearance of immunologically reactive sIgA within 30 minutes after starting the incubation, while no changes in sIgA content were detectable at pH 4. Lysozyme proved to be resistant against peptic digestion. Tryptic digestion at pH 8 did not result in a decrease of human milk sIgA within 120 minutes of incubation at 37 degrees C while under analogous conditions lysozyme concentration approached to 0. These results point at the full bioavailability of both sIgA and lysozyme from human milk. The differing resistance of these protective substances against pepsin and trypsin is apparently adapted to physiological particularities of the digestive tract in early infancy.
