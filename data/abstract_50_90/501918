In order to evaluate efficacy and safety, cefamandole, a new cephalosporin, was given intravenously to 12 children with respiratory tract infections (11 cases) and urinary tract infection (1 case), who ranged in age from 2 months to 5 years old. Cefamandole sodium was administered 74 approximately 112 mg/kg/day in three or four equally divided doses by one-shot injection. The overall efficacy rate was 83.3% in 12 cases, i.e., good in 8, fairly good in 2, and poor in 2 cases. No adverse reaction was noted on any of our 12 cases.
