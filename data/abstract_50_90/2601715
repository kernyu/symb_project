We selected lines of Plasmodium chabaudi that are resistant to high levels of the antifolate drug pyrimethamine and have shown that rearrangement and duplication of a portion of chromosome 7 has occurred in the resistant lines. This chromosomal duplication results in an increase in the chromosome number from 14 to 15: two derived chromosomes (450 kilobases and 1.1 megabases) were smaller than the original chromosome 7 (1.3 megabases), so that essentially only a 200-kilobase region was duplicated. This region contained the DHFR-TS gene and the closely linked Hsp70 gene. We have macrorestriction mapped chromosome 7 from the pyrimethamine-susceptible line (DS) and also the duplicated chromosome 7s in the resistant line. From these maps, we have proposed a process for the karyotype changes. Sequencing of the DHFR gene from the parent and derived chromosomes showed that there were no mutations in the coding sequence. As a result of the duplication of the DHFR-TS gene, there is at least a twofold increase in expression of the DHFR-TS gene, and this may explain the ability of the pyrimethamine-resistant lines to grow in increased amounts of the drug.
