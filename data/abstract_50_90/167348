Enterobacteria multiresistant to usual antibiotics, often remain sensitive to nalidixic acid, sometimes as a result of synergy with polymixins. Use of the intravenous route makes it possible to obtain more than adequate serum levels. Pharmacological study has indicated appropriate doses in terms of renal function. Intravenous nalidixic acid has been used in the treatment of 31 cases of Gram negative septicaemia, with success in 22. These results are all the more significant given that the patients were all seriously ill, cultures having grown multiresistant organisms and that nalidixic acid was used only after other antibiotics had failed.
