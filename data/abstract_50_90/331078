The firA200 mutation of E. coli not only renders RNA synthesis thermosensitive but also eliminates the high-level resistance to rifampicin associated with certain mutations in the beta subunit of the RNA polymerase. A priori, the firA gene is likely to code for an essential component of the transcription apparatus. The isolation is reported of transducing phages for the firA gene, constructed in vitro by fusing fragments of the E. coli chromosomes into a lambdoid bacteriophage. Such phages carry at least two essential genes and are able to suppress both the thermosensitivity and abnormal rifampicin sensitivity associated with the firA200 allele. The finding that some, but not all, of the lambdafirA phages have a temperature dependent growth defect is discussed.
