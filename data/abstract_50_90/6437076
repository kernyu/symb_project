A variant of frog virus 3 (FV3) resistant to 200 micrograms/ml phosphonoacetate was isolated, and used to establish that the DNA polymerase induced in FV3-infected cells was virus coded. In addition, inhibitor studies showed that the FV3 polymerase is similar to eukaryotic polymerase alpha in its sensitivity to aphidicolin, and that resistance to phosphonoacetate does not confer cross-resistance to thymidine arabinoside or acycloguanosine.
