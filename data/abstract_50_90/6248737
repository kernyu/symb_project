The genes for restriction-modification system EcoRII have been cloned from plasmid N3 DNA using RSF2124 as a vector plasmid. The hybrid plasmids designated pFK321 and pFK322 contained a 5.8 megadaltons EcoRI--fragment derived from N3 DNA including the genes for restriction-modification system EcoRII and a gene for resistance to sulfanilamide.
