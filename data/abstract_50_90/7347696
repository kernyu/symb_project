The interactions between josamycin, other macrolides and lincomycin have been considered as far as the microbic resistance phenomenon is concerned, in relation to Staph. aureus strains. It has been possible to give rise to resistance to josamycin as well as to erythromycin even though the daily average increase is far lower for josamycin. Subinhibitory concentrations of josamycin have not provoked resistance in relation to other macrolides while this phenomenon has been observed as far as the use of erythromycin is concerned.
