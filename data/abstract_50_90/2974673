The possibility of using phages, isolated from the lysogenic cultures of methicillin-resistant staphylococci and modified in methicillin-resistant cultures of phage 85, for the differentiation of nontypable staphylococcal strains has been studied. The variants of phage 85 cannot be used for the determination of differences between the strains of methicillin-resistant cultures; they are not suited for typing. For this purpose the collection of phages isolated from lysogenic methicillin-resistant cultures should be used.
