In this study we demonstrated that human NK cells activated by IFN or poly I:C were partially resistant to suppression by PGE2, PGD2, PGA2, PGI2, dibutyryl cAMP, isoproterenol, and theophylline. This partial loss of inhibition was not due to endogenous PG production because the addition of indomethacin to cultures stimulated with IFN or poly I:C did not prevent the partial loss of sensitivity to PGE2. NK cells incubated in the presence of PGE2 overnight, however, were not sensitive to inhibition. IFN or poly I:C did not stimulate PG synthesis nor elevate intracellular cAMP levels of NK cells. On the other hand, IFN or poly I:C diminished the accumulation of intracellular cAMP levels in NK cells in response to PGE2 stimulation. Dibutyryl cAMP and theophylline suppressed the cytolytic activity of the unstimulated cells more than that of the activated cells. A possible mechanism for the IFN-induced unresponsiveness to PGE2 may be a compartmentalized loss of cAMP responsiveness. Cycloheximide, puromycin, emetine, and actinomycin D blocked NK activation by IFN and poly I:C as well as the acquisition of resistance to PGE2-mediated suppression.
