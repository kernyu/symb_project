The inactivation of a genetic determinant critical for streptolysin S production was accomplished by transfer and insertion of the transposon Tn916 into the DNA of a group A streptococcal strain. The group D strain CG110 was able to efficiently transfer Tn916 into the group A strain CS91 when donor and recipient cells were concentrated and incubated together on membrane filters. Among tetracycline-resistant transconjugants, nonhemolytic mutants that no longer produced streptolysin S and retained the capacity to produce streptolysin O were discovered. Hemolytic revertants from these mutants regained tetracycline sensitivity; other revertants still retained a tetracycline resistance phenotype. Hybridization studies employing Tn916 DNA located Tn916 sequences in EcoRI and HindIII fragments of DNA from mutants devoid of streptolysin S; one carried a single copy of Tn916, and the other two carried multiple copies of the transposon.
