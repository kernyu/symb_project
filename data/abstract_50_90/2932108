Doxorubicin-resistant P388 mouse leukemia cells are cross-resistant to anthracycline and non-anthracycline DNA intercalators as well as to natural and semisynthetic anthracyclines which bind weakly or not at all to DNA. In the presence of a non-lethal concentration of 5 microM trifluoperazine cytotoxic effects of the strong DNA binding drugs actinomycin-D, mitoxantrone and m-AMSA were enhanced less than 2 fold in doxorubicin-sensitive cells and up to 50 fold in doxorubicin-resistant cells. Additionally, trifluoperazine induced a greater than 2-fold enhancement in the cytotoxic effects (but not accumulation and retention) of the strong DNA binder N,N-dimethyladriamycin-14-valerate only in doxorubicin resistant cells. In contrast, cell kill, drug accumulation and retention in P388/S and P388/DOX cells treated with the weak DNA binders N-benzyl-adriamycin-14-valerate and 7(R)-O-methylnogarol, and DNA-nonbinding N,N-dibenzyldaunorubicin was similar with or without trifluoperazine treatment. The study demonstrates that the calmodulin inhibitor trifluoperazine induces a specific and marked enhancement in the cytotoxic effects of strong vs weak DNA binding antitumor drugs in doxorubicin-resistant cells.
