Spectinomycin (SPC) was inactivated in the presence of adenosine-5'-triphosphate and magnesium ion by an enzyme preparation made from Acinetobacter calcoaceticus subsp. anitratus GN12313 resistant to both SPC and streptomycin. The structure of the inactivated SPC was found to be the adenylylated product of the hydroxy group on C-9 of the actinamine moiety.
