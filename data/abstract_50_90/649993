The bactericidal effectiveness of cephapirin and cephalothin against small (approximately 10(5)) and large (approximately 10(8)) inocula of penicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus was evaluated. With the smaller inoculum, no differences in bactericidal activity between the two drugs (tested at 2 and 40 microgram/ml) were seen after incubation for 2, 4, 6, or 24 hr. Neither cephalosporin effectively killed a larger inoculum in a concentration of 250 times the minimal bactericidal concentration for selected strains. Total inactivation of cephapirin (40 microgram/ml) by eight of 13 strains was demonstrated with the larger inoculum. These preliminary studies indicate that inactivation of cephapirin is pH-dependent. No strain inactivated cephapirin in less than or equal to 4 hr. Inactivation was independent of temperature at 37 C and 42 C. Although cephalothin was resistant to inactivation under the same conditions, the inoculum required to inactivate cephapirin was not killed by 100 microgram of cephalothin/ml. Although strains of S. aureus that slowly inactivate cephapirin appear to be prevalent, no strain that rapidly inactivates this cephalosporin was identified.
