Stable dwarf forms of Staphylococcus aureus have been identified in clinical specimens as the sole or predominant isolate in eight cases. These organisms have been shown to be menadione or thiamine dependent, i.e., cultivation in the presence of one of these agents has permitted growth of colonies which appear typical of S. aureus. In vitro resistance to aminoglycosides was overcome by cultivation in the presence of menadione or thiamine. Menadione- or thiamine-requiring S. aureus can be considered as causative agents in severe human infections. Special care must be taken if they are to be identified in pathological specimens. Their antibiotic sensitivity testing should be done comparatively on supplemented and nonsupplemented media.
