The usefulness of cefteram pivoxil (CFTM-PI) was evaluated in 99 cases with respiratory tract infections: 32 cases with acute bronchitis, 51 cases with infectious exacerbations of chronic respiratory diseases and 16 cases with pneumonia. 1. The clinical efficacies included marked improvement in 27 cases, improvement in 51 cases, moderate improvement in 9 cases, no change in 10 cases and deterioration in 2 cases. The improvement rate was 78.8%. 2. Overall effects were excellent in 12 cases, good in 9 cases and fair in 5 cases. There was no case in which efficacy was not observed and the efficacy rate was 80.8%. 3. Bacteriological effects were classified according to the causative organisms. Eradication rate was 80.8% (21 of 26 strains), indicating an excellent antibacterial action of CFTM-PI. In particular, MICs of cefteram were below 0.05 microgram/ml against all 10 strains of Haemophilus influenzae regardless of beta-lactamase production even with an inoculum of 10(8) or 10(6) cells/ml. 4. Side effects rarely occurred and included a slight gastrointestinal irritation in 4 of 99 cases (4%). Two cases which had abnormal elevations of GOT and GPT had abnormal values prior to administration of CFTM-PI. The elevations were slight and it was possible to continue administration. The GOT and GPT values were improved after the end of administration. The above results indicate the usefulness of CFTM-PI in acute respiratory infections and infectious exacerbation of chronic respiratory diseases.
