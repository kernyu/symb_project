The poly-etiologic profile of cancer patients and poly-resistance of pathogens causing infections in them are the features defining disease-specific infectious complications. Such pathogens are isolated from both monocultures and associations depending on the infection localization. The taxonomic position of the pathogens defines the level of their poly-resistance. The etiologic structure of the infections and the pathogen sensitivity spectrum change in time. In this connection the choice of antibacterial drugs for treatment of infections in cancer patients should be grounded by the data on bacteriological assays of pathological specimens from individual patients or by the combined data on bacteriological assays of analogous pathological specimens from a group of similar patients.
