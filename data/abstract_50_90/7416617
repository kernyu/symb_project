The results are reported of a service in Hong Kong of intensive antituberculosis chemotherapy with 5 drugs given daily for 4 months, or until discharge from hospital or release from prison if earlier, in the treatment of male Chinese drug addicts and prisoners who had pulmonary tuberculosis positive for acid-fast bacilli on microscopic examination of the sputum. Of 69 patients who received 4 months of chemotherapy, all those with sputum cultures negative for M. tuberculois initially, and more than 80% of those with positive cultures, 41% of whom had strains resistant to isoniazid, streptomycin, or both drugs, achieved quiescent disease, which was maintained for a year of follow-up. Some of the patients who received less than 4 months of chemotherapy also reponded well. Despite the 5 drugs, the frequency of adverse reactions to the regimen was low.
