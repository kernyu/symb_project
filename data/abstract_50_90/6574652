The effect of four exogenous prostaglandins, PGA1, PG802, PGE2 and PGF2 alpha, upon the lower urinary tract was investigated in female mongrel dogs without neurogenic lesions in vivo. The urethral resistance was studied by means of a urethral pressure profile, and the bladder function by evaluating whether or not the micturition was triggered. The reduction of urethral resistance in terms of the maximum urethral closure pressure was most significant with PGE2 given intraaterially. Micturition was most frequently provoked by the intravenous administration of PG802, a derivative of PGE1. PGE series seemed to be the most potent for the evacuation of urine in female dogs.
