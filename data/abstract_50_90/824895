291 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa from human bacteriological samples were compared with 102 strains which had been isolated from animals for frequency of pyocine-types and patterns of antibiotic resistance. 146 strains had been isolated from hospitalized patients and 145 from out-patients. More strains of animal origin were sensitive to carbenicillin and tetracyclines compared to strains of human origin. Since the frequency of different pyocine-types is the same in all three groups, it is concluded, that antibiotic resistance may be transferred from man to animal and vice versa via transfer of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
