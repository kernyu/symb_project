From January through March of 1985, the Sapporo Clinical Research Group for STD treated 69 cases of gonococcal infections (61 cases of male gonococcal urethritis and 8 cases of female gonococcal cervicitis) at its facilities in Sapporo City. The therapeutic efficacy of one shot therapy of Spectinomycin (SPCM) was investigated, and an epidemiological study on the cases and bacteriological studies on the isolated strains of Neisseria gonorrhoeae were made. The male patients were between 19 and 55 years old, with a peak age distribution in the younger half of the twenties. The female patients were between 18 and 40 years old. The major source of infections was a so-called special massage parlor which accounted for 36.1% of male cases. The isolation rate of PPNG were 16.7% (11/66). The MIC (inoculum size; 10(6) CFU/ml) of SPCM ranged from 3.13 to 25 micrograms/ml regardless of beta-lactamase production. In male patients, the eradication rate (efficacy rate) of N. gonorrhoeae by SPCM was 94.7% on the first day, 93.6% on the third day and 100% on the seventh day after 2 g one shot therapy. In female patients, the rate was 100% on the third and seventh day after 2 g one shot therapy, and 75% on the first day, 66.7% on third day and 100% on seventh day after 4 g one shot therapy. We considered that one shot therapy of SPCM was effective for gonococcal infection also in the present time. Especially SPCM was effective for infections by PPNG, since it was not resolved by beta-lactamase of N. gonorrhoeae. Positive rate of Chlamydia trachomatis was 16.3% in male gonococcal urethritis, and the serous discharge tended to remain longer in the positive patients than in the negative patients. There was only one side effect (1.4%), therefore SPCM was recognized to be a safely administrated antimicrobial agent.
