Induction of the synthesis of a plasmid-encoded polypeptide (E3) by erythromycin is known to be required for the inducible expression of resistance to the macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B group of antibiotics in Bacillus subtilis strains carrying the plasmid pE194. This resistance is mediated by a specific N6-dimethylation of adenine in the 23S rRNA of the large ribosomal subunit. We show in this report that E3 induction is regulated posttranscriptionally in the sense that it can occur when RNA synthesis is blocked and that induction is accompanied by an increase in the functional half-life of E3 mRNA but not of the mRNA species that code for the remaining four known pE194 polypeptides. The induction of E3 is subject to feedback regulation and involves the ribosome. Modification of the erythromycin binding site on the ribosome by methylation or by mutation interferes with induction.
