An established standard antimicrobial disc susceptibility test recommends the use of a 150-mm petri dish. Many workers substitute 100-mm plates and use various types of mechanical dispensers. A comparison of zone diameters was made by testing Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli against penicillin and chloramphenicol with the use of these different sized plates and dispensers. Zone diameters were consistently smaller at the edges of plates than in the center (0.4 to 1.2 mm). Significant small differences of up to 1.2 mm or no differences were observed when the mean diameters from these various plates were compared. All of the zone diameter measurements fell within accepted values for analytical variability in this procedure. There is no evidence that any individual combination of plates, dispensers, or disc locations provides greater precision in zone diameter measurement. More difficulty was encountered in measuring zones at the periphery of small plates. This suggests that busy clinical laboratory workers might not produce work of comparable quality with the smaller plates.
