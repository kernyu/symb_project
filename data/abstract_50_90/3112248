The human breast cancer cells BT-20 were treated for 18 months in the continuous presence of interferon-gamma (HuIFN-gamma; 500 U/ml). These cells have become completely resistant to HuIFN-gamma and interestingly also to IFN-alpha 2. However, the expression of HLA-DR and the regulation of cell adhesion to tissue culture plastic remained partially under the domain of HuIFN-gamma. A reduced number of IFN-gamma binding sites in comparison to the wild-type cells were observed on the IFN-resistant BT-20 cells.
