The opinions of 28 investigators representing all areas of pediatric infectious diseases were sought regarding priorities for research. Seven general areas were most commonly emphasized: new diagnostic methods (especially for viral infections), vaccines (bacterial, respiratory viruses, herpesviruses, and varicella-zoster), diarrhea (pathogenesis), National Institutes of Health (NIH)-sponsored studies of antimicrobial agents, NIH-sponsored cooperative studies of uncommon infections, host factors related to susceptibility and resistance and host responses to infection, and studies of bacterial-viral interaction and mechanisms of antimicrobial resistance. Where pediatric and adult medicine interests overlap, collaborative studies would be desirable.
