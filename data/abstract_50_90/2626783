A natural DNA-intercalator plant benzo-c-phenanthridine alkaloid sanguinarine is more toxic for mouse transformed fibroblast L-cells in culture than synthetic DNA-intercalator ethidium bromide (EtB) and alkaloid berberine. Dimidium bromide is also an inhibitor of the L-cell growth. In assay conditions, growth of L-cells is stopped by 1.5 x 10(-5) M of sanguinarine. Lebr-625 cells, resistant to 25 micrograms/ml of EtB, have sanguinarine sensitivity close to that of L-cells, but Lebr-625 cells are resistant to dimidium bromide. Sanguinarine is more toxic for L-cells in culture than the anticancer drug cis-PtNH3)2Cl2. Trans-Pt(NH3)2Cl2 is less toxic for these cells. The strong toxicity of sanguinarine for L- and Lebr-625 cells in culture, as compared to other DNA-complexing drugs, seems to be associated with the wide range of potential cell targets for sanguinarine influence. Besides the inhibition of nucleic acid metabolism reactions, characteristic of DNA-intercalators, and disruption the mitochondrial ATP synthesis, also characteristic of organic heterocyclic cationic molecules of DNA-intercalators, sanguinarine can modify the thiol groups of enzymes including SH-sensitive membrane-bound Na+, K(+)-ATPase of cerebral cortex and Ca2(+)-ATPase of skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum fragments.
