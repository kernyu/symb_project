BCNU (carmustine), VM26 (teniposide) and ARA-A5'P (vidarabin-monophosphate) were compared in their activity against 30 cell lines of primary (N = 21) and metastatic (N = 9) human brain tumours, which were characterized in tissue culture by cytochemical, immunological and cytogenetic criteria. In vivo achievable concentration-time products c X t were correlated with in vitro pharmacokinetic data in order to evaluate in vitro drug sensitivity at relevant exposure doses. A microcytotoxicity assay was employed to screen for drug toxicity in individual tumour cell lines. Following drug exposure and 5 to 8 population doubling times of untreated controls, RNA-synthesis - as a parameter of cell metabolism and proliferation - was determined by incorporation of [5,6-3H]-uridine into cellular RNA (liquid scintillation counting protocol). The cytotoxic effect of each drug on individual cell lines was expressed in terms of a sensitivity index (SI); by these means effects of different drugs on individual tumour cell lines could be compared. Mean sensitivity indices of ARA-A5'P, BCNU and VM26 for primary brain tumour cell lines were 0.59, 0.82 and 0.54. ARA-A5'P and VM26 had almost similar activities against brain tumour cell lines, whereas BCNU was significantly (P less than 0.001) less active. High grade gliomas were less sensitive to all three agents than low grade and infratentorial gliomas. ARA-A5'P was also able to effectively reduce colony formation in brain tumour cell lines. A cross-resistance of ARA-A5'P to either BCNU or VM26 could not be observed. Clearly, ARA-A5'P is an effective drug in treatment of brain tumour cells in vitro.
