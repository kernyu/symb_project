The nucleotide sequence of the tetracycline resistance gene tetM encoded by streptococcal conjugative shuttle transposon Tn1545 has been determined. The resistance gene was identified as a coding sequence of 1917 base pairs corresponding to a protein with a Mr of 72,500 daltons. This value is in good agreement with that, 68,000 daltons, estimated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of Escherichia coli minicell extracts. The tetM gene product does not exhibit any sequence homology with either the Gram-negative (tetA, tetB and tetC), or the Bacillus and Staphylococcus tetracycline resistance proteins. The average hydropathy value of the tetM gene product (-0.21) contrasts with those calculated for the other TET proteins which are markedly hydrophobic (0.76 to 0.93). Hybridization experiments performed with an intragenic tetM probe do not support the claim [Taylor, D. (1986), J. Bact. 165, 1037-1039)] that tetracycline resistance in Campylobacter is due to acquisition of tetM.
