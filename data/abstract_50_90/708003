Immunochemical analysis of 2 polysaccharide-containing structures of the lypopolysaccharide of the plague causative agent (main somatic antigen and lipopolysaccharide) isolated from K-1 strain and a number of its antibiotic resistant mutants was carried out. It was shown that development of resistance to streptomycin alone or its combination with monomycin did not cause detectable changes in the monosaccharide composition and serological properties of the cultures tested. More significant changes associated with development of complex resistance, i.e. K-1 (Strr leads to Penr leads to Tetr) were accompanied by a decrease in the content of hexozamine and serological activity of the main somatic antigen determining the O-specificity of the lipopolysaccharide. Defective changes in the monosaccharide composition and serological properties of both the main somatic antigen and the polysaccharide were observed in the yellow variant of the streptomycin resistant mutant K-1.
