Disk diffusion zone diameter breakpoint criteria for ofloxacin were tentatively established by correlating MICs with 1-, 3-, and 5-micrograms disk inhibitory zone diameters for 638 bacterial isolates representing 36 species. We recommend use of 5-micrograms disks with the following breakpoints: susceptible (MIC, less than or equal to 2.0 micrograms/ml), greater than or equal to 16 mm; intermediate (MIC, 4.0 micrograms/ml), 13 to 15 mm; and resistant (MIC, greater than or equal to 8.0 micrograms/ml), less than or equal to 12 mm.
