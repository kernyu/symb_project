Plasmid DNA from Bacillus subtilis was introduced into monolayers of human fibroblasts by means of a modification of the calcium phosphate coprecipitation technique, comprising centrifugation of the coprecipitate onto the cells and treatment with polyethyleneglycol. The amount of DNA resistant to removal from the monolayers ranged from 10% to 15% of the input DNA. By determination of the biological activity of the plasmid DNA, re-extracted after various periods following entry into the fibroblasts and subsequently used as donor for B. subtilis protoplasts, it was shown that the activity of the plasmid DNA was gradually lost. When ultraviolet light-inactivated plasmid DNA was used as donor, reactivation of the plasmid was observed, which was completed within 2 h. The dose-dependent incorporation of [14C]-thymidine suggests that DNA repair processes were involved in reactivation of the plasmid DNA.
