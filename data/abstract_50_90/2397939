The antibiotic sensitivity of 197 coliform sp. isolated from drinking water in five rural areas was studied. Twelve strains (6.1%) showed multiple antibiotic resistance, three (1.5%) of which were able to transfer the resistances to an Escherichia coli K-12 recipient. It seems unlikely that the occurrence of transmissible multiple antibiotic resistance among coliforms in drinking water in the areas studied poses a significant public health risk.
