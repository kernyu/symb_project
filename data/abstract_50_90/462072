A study carried out on 206 bacteriemia infections showed that: the following bacterial flora was implicated in the etiology of bacteremia infections: Staphylococcus aureus in 28.6% of cases, Staphylococcus albus in 20.4% Enterobacteriaceae in 25.7% and Pseudomonas in 3.8%; an increase existed in the number of generalized infections caused by opportunists belonging to the Enterobacteriaceae family and Pseudomonas genus. Similarly, an increase in the resistance to the recently introduced antibiotics, Septrin and Gentamycin, was noted. These observation require antibiotic lebel control and, if it is necessary the association of two or more antibiotics in severe infections.
