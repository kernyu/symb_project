The persistence of Vibrio cholerae, biotype el tor, in a patient treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was due to the acquisition of a conjugative resistance plasmid. The plasmid, with a molecular size of 72 megadaltons, belonged to incompatibility group 6-C and conferred resistance to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, sulfonamide, and trimethoprim.
