The dehydration of bacteria by vacuum exposure results in damage to the cell membrane. This membrane damage does not necessarily lead to cell death. A part of the dehydrated bacteria is capable of eliminating the membrane damage by repair processes. Repair can proceed rapidly under conditions that permit synthesizing activities. The kinetics of this repair process were studied by means of the membrane-mediated biosynthesis of the cell wall as well as by the recovery of resistance to small concentrations of lysozyme. Repair is a precondition for cell proliferation. At low temperature cells can conserve their membrane damage and the repair process can be initiated when conditions become favourable.
