Sixty two patients with metastases of testicular teratoblastoma were subjected to combination chemotherapy. Forty nine patients were treated with an association of bleomycin and vincaalkaloids. An objective effect was gained in 77.5%. Ten patients were treated with a combination of bleomycin, vinblastine, natulane, dactinomycin, an effect being gained in 60% of the patients. The treatment with cis-diamini-dichloroplatinum was effective in 8 of 11 patients (72.7%). In 6 of 10 patients treated with olivomycin and cyclophosphane the effect was obtained (in 60%), when they were resistant to bleomycin combinations. Evidence is presented of high-effectiveness of the combinations including bleomycin as well as of the effect of cis-diamini-dichloroplatinum in treatment of testicular teratoblastomas. With pharmaceutical resistance to bleomycin it is recommended to continue olivomycin and cyclophosphane chemotherapy.
