Although these new antibiotics are powerful broad-spectrum agents, the decision to use new antibiotics should be based on careful assessment of the patient's clinical status and need for therapy, the known resistance patterns of the hospital or community, and cost-benefit factors. Indiscriminate widespread use will limit or abolish their usefulness and needlessly increase the cost of hospital therapy.
