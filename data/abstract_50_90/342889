The sensitivity patterns of strains of enteropathogenic Escherichia coli associated with diarrhoeal disease of infants to tobramycin and other antibiotics were estimated. The activity of tobramycin and of gentamicin alone and in combinations against recent isolates of enteropathogenic Escherichia coli was investigated. It was found that all the strains included in the present study were sensitive to tobramycin and gentamicin and most of them were sensitive to colistin and furazolidone. No significant differences in minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and rates of killing were found between tobramycin and gentamicin, and they acted in an additive manner against most of the strains tested.
