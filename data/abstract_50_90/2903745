Hydrolysis of OSCP of bovine heart mitochondria by proteinase from Staphylococcus aureus V8 was followed by isolation of all individual peptides by means of gel-filtration and HPLC. Structural analysis of the peptides allowed to arrange BrCN-fragments and to reconstruct the complete amino acid sequence of the protein. Comparative structural analysis revealed existence of a certain homology between OSCP and delta- and b-subunits of the E. coli H+-ATPase, which are necessary for interaction of catalytic and proton-conducting parts of the bacterial enzyme.
