The antiproliferative (AP) action of human leukocytic interferon (HLI) of varying degrees of purification was studied and compared in cultures of human cells differing in interferon sensitivity. The concentrated and purified preparations of HLI suppressed the incorporation of 3H-thymidine and mitotic activities of the cultures sensitive to HLI of the cells, affecting, but insignificantly, the proliferation of the resistant cell culture. Poorly purified HLI suppressed the proliferation of both cell types. This indicates that native HLI contains impurities that have an AP action and exerts no antiviral activity.
