Trimethoprim inhibits dihydrofolate reductase. Mutations conferring trimethorpim-resistance on E coli K12 result in either an altered reductase with decreased affinity for the drug, or in 2-30 fold higher levels of the enzyme. Studies of the latter class of mutants indicate that dihydrofolate reductase is regulatdd by a diffusible molecule, and is probably under negative control. The regulatrory mutants, some of which are temperature-sensitive, act cis.
