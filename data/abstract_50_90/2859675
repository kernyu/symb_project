Twelve antimicrobial agents were tested for use in axenic cultures of Entamoeba histolytica and Giardia lamblia. Ten did not inhibit parasite growth at concentrations of at least two-fold above the effective antibacterial or antifungal levels. We have found the combination of piperacillin (500 micrograms/ml) plus amikacin (125 micrograms/ml) to be useful in axenization of a new strain of E. histolytica, eradication of multiply drug-resistant contaminants in cultures and prevention of bacterial growth in experiments with non-sterile components.
