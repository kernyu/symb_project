Clinical studies on cefminox (CMNX, MT-141) were conducted and the following results were obtained. Twelve cases of bacterial infections were treated with CMNX with a satisfactory result of "excellent" in 9 and "good" in 3. Antibacterial activity was examined in 7 cases. Pathogenic organisms which were S. aureus, beta-Streptococcus, H. influenzae, S. pneumoniae and P. morganii were eradicated in all the cases. Mean maximum serum concentrations of CMNX after intravenous injection of 10, 20 and 40 mg/kg were 54.5 mcg/ml, 102.3 mcg/ml and 202.4 mcg/ml, respectively which were obtained 15 minutes after each injection. Mean half-lives of each dose group were 1.60, 1.13 and 1.51 hours, respectively. Mean urinary excretion rates of CMNX at 6 hours after intravenous injection in 10, 20, 30 and 40 mg/kg groups were 73.5%, 80.9%, 92.6% and 66.5%, respectively. Side effects were not observed clinically, but anemia in 1 case and eosinophilia in 2 cases were noted in laboratory examination.
