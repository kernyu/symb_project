The BACTEC radiometric method of drug susceptibility testing of Mycobacterium tuberculosis is a reliable and rapid diagnostic tool in clinical mycobacteriology. However, large scale comparative studies have also shown that the level of agreement with standard methodology was less satisfactory with strains resistant to ethambutol and streptomycin than with strains resistant to rifampin and to isoniazid. Since disagreement with drug resistance strains is far more frequent than with drug susceptible strains, it was felt that only the comparison of a large number of resistant strains would be needed to further refine this new technique. The analysis of BACTEC-derived data for isoniazid and rifampin shows that the level of agreement with conventional methodology falls well within accepted limits. Statistical analysis of the radiometric versus conventional comparisons shows no significant differences between the two methods in the case of isoniazid, rifampin, and ethambutol (3 mg/L). Streptomycin and two other ethambutol concentrations tested showed lower levels of agreement and significant statistical differences with conventional methodology.
