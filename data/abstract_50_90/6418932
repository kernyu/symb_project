In vitro synergistic activities of new aminoglycoside antibiotic micronomicin (MCR, Sagamicin) combined with oxacephem antibiotic latamoxef (LMOX, Siomarin) were investigated. These antibiotics exhibited synergistic activities at FIC index lower than 0.5 against 20.8%, 32.7% and 1.9% of clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (48 strains), Serratia marcescens (52 strains) and Escherichia coli (54 strains), respectively. Partial synergism (0.5 less than FIC index less than 1) was observed in 79.2%, 55.8% and 31.5% of the same microorganisms, too. Each bacteriostatic concentrations of MCR and LMOX showed synergistically bactericidal effects when the drugs were administered at the same time against P. aeruginosa BMH No. 1, S. marcescens F-3283 and E. coli GN2411-5.
