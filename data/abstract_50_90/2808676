We compared disk susceptibility, plasmid analysis, aminoglycoside resistance patterns, and DNA hybridization for their usefulness in characterizing isolates from a hospital outbreak of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Fifteen isolates were susceptible (group 1) and 28 were resistant (group 2) to gentamicin. A total of 15 of 15 (100%) group 1 and 22 of 28 (79%) group 2 isolates carried a 21.5-megadalton plasmid. All group 2 isolates and none of the group 1 isolates possessed a 33-megadalton plasmid. Aminoglycoside resistance pattern determinations revealed the presence of the ANT(4')-I enzyme (aminoglycoside 4' adenyltransferase) in all group 1 isolates but was unable to demonstrate presence of this enzyme in group 2 organisms. The APH(2") + AAC(6')-II enzyme (aminoglycoside 2" phosphotransferase plus 6' acetyltransferase) was found in all of the group 2 isolates but in none of the group 1 isolates. Use of DNA hybridization revealed the presence of the ANT(4')-I enzyme in both groups (group 1, 14 of 15; group 2, 26 of 28). In this hospital outbreak, we found good correlation between disk susceptibility, plasmid profile, aminoglycoside resistance patterns, and DNA hybridization results. It was difficult to predict the presence of the ANT(4')-I enzyme in the presence of the bifunctional [APH(2") + AAC(6')-II] enzyme by the aminoglycoside resistance pattern method because of overlap of the substrate profile.
