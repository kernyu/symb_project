More than 500 clinical isolates were screened for resistance to a number of antibiotics, including imipemide (N-formimidoyl thienamycin [MK0787]). Of the 25 coagulase-negative staphylococcal isolates present in the screening sample, almost one-third showed one of two patterns of imipemide resistance. One pattern apparently involves constitutive expression of drug resistance, whereas the other pattern seems to result from an inducible resistance having an apparent induction threshold higher than the minimal inhibitory concentration of imipemide. The mechanism(s) responsible for this imipemide resistance is unclear, but may be distinct from the more common staphylococcal mechanisms of resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics. Only two of the patients from whom imipemide-resistant staphylococci were cultured had actually been treated with the antibiotic.
