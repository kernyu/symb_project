Plasmid profiles of Staphylococcus aureus, isolated from herds affected with chronic bovine mastitis, are heterogeneous, as shown by the study of 85 strains from 18 different farms. The strains isolated within a herd sometimes show related plasmid patterns, although even strains isolated from different quarters of the same udder may show variations in their plasmid content. Strains without antibiotic resistance are frequently free of plasmids. Therefore, the existence of mastitis Staph. aureus virulence plasmids is unlikely. Staphylococcus aureus, resistant to penicillin and streptomycin from 9 different farms show related plasmid patterns. This result confirms a geographic spread of certain mastitis Staph. aureus strains.
