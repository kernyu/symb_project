A highly purified rabbit interferon was tested for its capacity to inhibit various manifestations of infection of primary rabbit kidney (RK) cells with vesicular stomatitis (VS) virus. A kinetic analysis of the actinomycin-sensitive phase of interferon-induced cellular resistance revealed that RK cells could transcribe virtually all of the hypothetical antiviral messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) within 3 hr. Similar exposure to interferon reduced virus yield by 95 to 99% and markedly inhibited cytopathic effect on RK cells infected at a multiplicity of 10 or less. Interferon was less effective in blocking cytopathic effects when RK cells were infected at a multiplicity of 100. However, RK cells pretreated with the same amount of interferon and infected at a multiplicity of 100 failed to incorporate (3)H-amino acids into structural or nonstructural proteins of VS virus identified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Despite this inhibition of viral protein synthesis, interferon did not prevent the switch off by VS virus of cellular protein synthesis. The rapidity with which a high multiplicity of VS virus switched off cellular protein synthesis, even in cells rendered resistant to viral infection by interferon, is further evidence that this reaction is caused by an infecting virion component rather than by a newly synthesized viral product.
