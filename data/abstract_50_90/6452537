1. Susceptibility, concentrations in serum and spinal fluid, and clinical effect of cefoperazone (CPZ), a newly developed cephalosporin in Japan, were examined in 28 infants from 2 days to 12 years of ages with various infections. 2. The overall clinical evaluation in 22 cases received CPZ alone was found to be markedly effective in 11 cases and effective in 6 cases; the efficacy rate was as good as 85.0%. 3. The mean half-life following a single intravenous injection of 25 mg/kg to 3 infants was 80.7 minutes. 4. The side effects observed during the therapy were 2 cases of rash and 1 case of vascular pain and these symptoms improved after interruption of therapy. The side effects of CPZ seemed to be not more noticeable than other cephalosporins.
