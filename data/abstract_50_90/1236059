Bacteriological examination of 100 cases of otitis in dogs revealed pure cultures of different microorganisms as follows: Staphylococcus aureus from 25 animals; Escherichia coli from 10; Proteus mirabilis from 20; Enterobacter sp. from 18 and Klepsiella sp. from 7. Mixed cultures of Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klepsiella sp. were found in 3 animals; Staphylococcus aureus and Enterobacter sp. in 5; Staphylococcus aureus and Proteus mirabilis in 4. Enterobacter sp. and Klepsiella sp. in 2 and Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus mirabilis and Escherichia coli in 6. Theses results indicated that Staphylococcus aureus appeared as the most frequent microorganism (36%) followed by Proteus mirabilis (23%) and Klepsiella sp. (16%). Drug resistance studies showed that all tested strains were resistant to the antibiotics and to the nalidixic acid in levels higher than 20microgram/ml except gentamycin which showed for Pseudomonas aeruginosa a resistance level for 10microgram/ml.
