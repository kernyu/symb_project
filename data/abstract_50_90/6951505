Of 43 isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, 90% were inhibited by 8 micrograms or less of N-formimidoyl thienamycin per ml by the agar-dilution technique. Cefamandole, cefotaxime, cefoperazone, moxalactam, and cefsulodin showed relatively poor activity. Vancomycin was the most active compound by weight, inhibiting 93% of strains at 1 microgram/ml.
