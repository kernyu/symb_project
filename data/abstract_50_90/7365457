A naturally occurring transmissible plasmid, designated pAV1, has been isolated in Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. It specifies resistance to sulphonamides and is capable of mobilizing two non-transmissible resistance determinants for tetracycline and neomycin, respectively, within strains of A. calcoaceticus. It is incompatible with the P class R factors RP4 and R751 in A. calcoaceticus. On this basis we conclude that pAV1 is a member of the P incompatibility group. However, unlike most other P group R factors, pAV1 is not transmissible to strains of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella or Proteus mirabilis.
