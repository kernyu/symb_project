The combination of intravenous ampicillin sodium and nafcillin sodium followed by oral ampicillin and dicloxacillin sodium was effective in treating five infants with soft-tissue infections and bacteremia due to beta-lactamase-producing, ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae type b. This antibiotic combination seems to be an effective alternative to chloramphenicol for treatment of non-meningitic invasive disease due to moderately ampicillin-resistant (minimum inhibitory concentration, 2 to 24 microgram/mL) H influenzae type b. The use of this combination should be in conjunction with appropriate in vitro tests whose results demonstrate synergism.
