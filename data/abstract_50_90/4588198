A system for the isolation of anaerobes based upon the use of reducible solid media is described. Plates of reducible media prepared and stored aerobically were reduced before use by incubation in a GasPak jar for 24 h. Clinical specimens for culture were carefully selected. The value of Amies transport medium was confirmed. Selective and nonselective formulations of reducible media were used for primary isolation. Abbreviated identification schemes based in part on gas-liquid chromatography are presented. The suitability of this system for improving the recovery and identification of anaerobes in a routine clinical laboratory is documented.
