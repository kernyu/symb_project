In a study including a limited number of 33 patients with bacterial infections the use of doxycycline as a drip infusion of Vibramycin dry fill proved to have a good clinical effect. The bacteriological tests showed that 58% of the tetracycline-sensitive germs demonstrated before therapy had been eliminated and another 6% markedly reduced. Clinically very good or good results were achieved in 76% of the patients. Toleration was excellent in all cases.
