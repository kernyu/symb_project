A comparison of agar dilution and microdilution susceptibility testing for eight antimicrobial agents, including roxithromycin, was performed against 48 isolates of Legionella pneumophila. For agar dilution tests, charcoal free agar (BSYE) and charcoal supplemented agar (BCYE) were used. In general, BSYE agar produced lower MICs than BCYE agar, except for imipenem. Microdilution testing data fell between the data obtained for the two agar media. The MBCs were two to sixteen fold higher than the MICs. Prolongation of the incubation time from 48 h to 72 h or growth in 5% CO2 did not influence the results. As tested by the microdilution method, an increase in the inoculum from 10(5) to 10(7) was associated with a two-fold increase in the MIC. Roxithromycin and two other investigational macrolides (A-56268 and rosaramicin) demonstrated better in-vitro activity than erythromycin.
