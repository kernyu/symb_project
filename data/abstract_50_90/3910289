563 cases of Falciparum malaria were detected in 1984 and 1985 in 7 malarial zones covering 3 climatic regions in Madagascar. All subjects underwent a therapeutic test; 175 strains of Plasmodium falciparum were isolated for in vitro drug sensitivity studies. 28 strains which were moderately chloroquine resistant in vitro were identified in 1983 in these various zones. However, 16% strains studied in 1984 in Alatsinainy (plateaux area), were chloroquine-resistant in vitro. The in vitro sensitivity to the other amino-4-quinolines seemed to be retained. In vivo, 7% of resistance type RI or RII were noted with 25 mg/kg of chloroquine but none with 25 mg/kg of amodiaquine. The usual therapeutic schedule for partially immune subjects (10 mg/kg in one dose) was ineffective on day 7 in 34% of the cases with chloroquine and 5% of the cases with amodiaquine. In conclusion to this study, we recommend that chemoprophylaxis should be stopped in schools in Madagascar and that presumed malarial attacks should be treated with a minimum dose of 25 mg/kg of chloroquine in 3 days. We suggest that amodiaquine should be used in cases of therapeutic failure with chloroquine.
