The genes for a Class II restriction-modification system (HhaII) from Haemophilus haemolyticus have been cloned in Escherichia coli. The vector used for cloning was plasmid pBR322 which confers resistance to tetracycline and ampicillin and contains a single endonuclease R-PstI site, (formula: see text), in the ampicillin gene. The procedure developed by Bolivar et al. (1977) was used to form DNA recombinants. H. haemolyticus DNA was cleaved with PstI endonuclease and poly(dC) extensions were added to the 3'-OH termini using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase. Circular pBR322 DNA was cleaved to linear molecules with PstI endonuclease and poly(dG) extensions were added to the 3'-OH termini, thus regenerating the PstI cleavage site sequences. Recombinant molecules, formed by annealing the two DNAs, were used to transfect a restriction and modification-deficient strain of E. coli (HB101 r-m-recA). Tetracycline-resistant clones were tested for acquisition of restriction phenotype (as measured by growth on plates seeded with phage lambdacI-0). A single phage-resistant clone was found. The recombinant plasmid, pD110, isolated from this clone, had acquired 3 kilobases of additional DNA which could be excised with PstI endonuclease. In addition to the restriction function, cells carrying the plasmid expressed the HhaII modification function. Both activities have been partially purified by single-stranded DNA-agarose chromatography. The cloned HhaII restriction activity yields cleavage patterns identical to HinfI. A restriction map of the cloned DNA segment is presented.
