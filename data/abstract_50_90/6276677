IS2 has been marked genetically by the in vitro insertion into its HindIII site of a 3.3 Kb HindIII fragment of Tn5 conferring resistance to kanamycin. The transposition of the IS2::Km, thus obtained, to lambda has been found and insertion sites were characterised. Each of ten independent IS2::Km insertions were found at the same site at 61.2% of the lambda map, always in the same orientation (orientation II relative to the xis gene). The integration sites of IS2::Km in five of the kanamycin-transducing phages were determined by DNA sequence analysis, and were found to be identical at the nucleotide level. Further transposition of IS2::Km from lambda to the bacterial chromosome was demonstrated.
