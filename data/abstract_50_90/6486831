Although the role of biological response modifiers in cancer therapy is well recognised, their mechanism of action remains unsettled. It is empirically considered that there may be some direct antitumor effects induced by some BRM. To analyse the mechanism of action, we evaluated the effects of BRM by using our in vitro sensitivity test, the principle of which was based on dynamic and morphological observation of target cells in vitro. Five kinds of BRM (OK-432, PSK, N-CWS, Bestatin, Lentinan) were tested and the target cell lines were L1210 and P388. The results showed that OK-432 and PSK were mildly cytotoxic, and that OK-432, PSK and Bestatin were effective for cell growth suppression.
