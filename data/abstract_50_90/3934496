The authors present their findings about a research on bacterial resistance carried out in a Lambarene hospital. Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa present a high level of resistance to ampicillin, carbenicillin and cefalexin. About 40 to 50% of the strains appear to be resistant to chloramphenicol and trimethoprim-sulfamethizole. The most recently imported cephalosporins are effective against Gram-negative germs. Gentamycin is also effective against Enterobacteriaceae, but uneffective against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Frequency of multi-resistance is alarming. 1/3 of the Neisseria gonorrhoeae strains are resistant to penicillin.
