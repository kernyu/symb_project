Studies on a Thoroughbred breeding farm in Ohio from 1982 to 1988 demonstrated the value of three anthelmintic pastes (ivermectin, oxibendazole, pyrantel pamoate) in controlling benzimidazole resistant cyathostomes (small strongyles) in adult horses. However, a comparison of drug efficacy in suppressing faecal egg counts for the full period between treatments showed a significant reduction in efficacy of all drugs in yearling horses compared with adults. Mean faecal egg counts of adult horses were generally kept below 100 eggs per gram (epg) of faeces when using oxibendazole or pyrantel pamoate at four to five week intervals and ivermectin at eight week intervals. By contrast, mean counts of young horses rose as high as 655 epg (oxibendazole), 729 epg (pyrantel pamoate) and 852 epg (ivermectin) within the same time period after treatment. Individual counts of treated yearlings sometimes exceeded 3,000 epg. Three distinct mechanisms appeared to be involved in the poor results in young horses. These were 1) anthelmintic refuge, 2) anthelmintic resistance, and 3) anthelmintic avoidance.
