Subclones of Escherichia coli K12 921 which produced a chromosomal beta-lactamase were naturally selected in vitro with ampicillin, cefoxitin and ceftriaxone. The selected subclones were identical with respect to beta-lactamase production, resistance spectrum and resistance level, regardless of the selection agent. A ceftriaxone selection following an ampicillin selection led to higher ceftriaxone resistance. The beta-lactamase which was formed hydrolysed ceftriaxone to a measurable extent. After incubation of ceftriaxone with the beta-lactamase, the hydrolysed degradation product was demonstrated by thin-layer chromatography.
