The present investigation was conducted to find out if a relapse of acute purulent otitis media is associated with a decreased sensitivity of nasopharyngeal pathogens to commonly used antimicrobial agents. All but one of 63 children with relapse included in this study yielded one or more of the classical middle ear pathogens (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Branhamella catarrhalis, S. pyogenes) in their nasopharynx (NPH) secretions. S. pneumoniae was the predominating isolate from NPH (71% of the patients) as well as from middle ear effusion (53%). At a control visit 4 weeks after the start of antibiotic therapy, 91% were NPH carriers of potential pathogens and S. pneumoniae was still the most common isolate (53%). Beta-lactamase was produced by 55% of B. catarrhalis isolates from the NPH specimens on the first visit, but only by 33% of B. catarrhalis isolates on the control visit. Two NPH isolates of H. influenzae produced beta-lactamase. One isolate of S. pneumoniae (serotype 18) was intermediately sensitive to phenoxymethylpenicillin. Generally low MICs were found for erythromycin and cefaclor. H. influenzae isolates were generally sensitive to ampicillin in vitro, but only 1 isolate was fully sensitive to erythromycin. B. catarrhalis isolates were uniformly sensitive to doxycycline and trimethoprim/sulphamethoxazole. No tolerance to penicillin was demonstrated in S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae. The present data indicate that the relapse of acute otitis media is not associated with development of tolerance or resistance to therapeutic antimicrobials commonly used.
