Fifty-eight patients seen in general practice presenting with symptoms of acute urinary tract infection were entered consecutively into an open randomized trial of 200 mg pivmecillinam plus 250 mg pivampicillin twice daily or 250 mg amoxycillin plus 125 mg clavulanate 3-times daily for 5 days. The results were analyzed in 41 patients with significant bacteriuria (23 on pivmecillinam/pivampicillin and 18 on amoxycillin/clavulanate). Both antibiotic combinations produced good overall bacteriological cure, but there were a considerable number of persisting symptoms despite the absence of significant bacteriuria. Eight patients in the pivmecillinam/pivampicillin group and 5 in the amoxycillin/clavulanate group had side-effects, principally thrush, vomiting and abdominal pain, and 1 patient from each group ceased treatment for this reason. Sensitivity profiles of urinary isolates (41 trial, 135 non-trial) to both combinations and to ampicillin and mecillinam showed that the majority were fully sensitive to amoxycillin/clavulanate and to a lesser extent to pivmecillinam/pivampicillin; resistance was highest to ampicillin.
