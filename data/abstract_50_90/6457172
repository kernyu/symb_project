A new antibiotic drug of oxacephem, with marked resistance to beta-lactamase, 6059-S for parenteral use was used in 12 patients with acute cholecystitis and cholangitis. 6059-S was given by intramuscular, intravenous or drip intravenous administration at a daily dose of 500 mg to 2 g. Clinical response was excellent in 1 case, good in 10 cases, fair in 1 case and poor in none. Any clinical adverse effect was not recognized. 6059-S is a dose of 500 mg was given by intramuscular administration before the operation to 9 patients. Tissue specimens of different sites were taken from removed organs. The materials of A-bile and B-bile were subsequently taken at intervals. 6059-S concentrations in the A-bile increased after injection and reached to peak from 2 hours to 2.5 hours, then declined very slowly. 6059-S concentration in the B-bile reached to high level of the concentration comparative quickly after intramuscular administration, and it was thought to be excreted through the wall of the gallbladder. 6059-S concentration in the gallbladder wall was directly proportional to the degree of pathological changes of inflammation. On the 6059-S concentration in patients with acute cholecystitis and cholangitis, the concentration in A-bile, B-bile and gallbladder wall were observed higher than the MIC of 6059-S for Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Therefore 6059-S will be a very useful drug when used for chemotherapy of the infectious diseases of the biliary tract.
