Three hundred twenty-nine strains of the tribe Klebsielleae were compared by several biochemical tests and by susceptibility to selected antibiotics. Biochemical tests included urease, amino acid decarboxylase, and hydrogen sulfide production; fermentation of lactose and dextrose; motility; and tests in the IMViC (indole, methyl red, Voges-Proskauer, citrate) series. The isolates were: Klebsiella species, 67.5%; Enterobacter species, 28%, and Serratia species, 4.5%. Minimal inhibitory concentrations of cephaloridine, cephalothin, and a new cephalosporin, cephalexin, and of ampicillin were determined by the agar dilution procedure. Cephalosporins at 20 mug/ml or less inhibited 90% of the Klebsiella strains but only 15% of the Enterobacter strains. Ampicillin inhibited 27% of Enterobacter strains and 17% of Klebsiella strains. Serratia isolates were insensitive to the cephalosporins and ampicillin. The results suggest that precise identification of this group to the generic level can be accomplished readily in the clinical laboratory and that such information is helpful in the preliminary selection of an antibiotic for treatment of clinical infections.
