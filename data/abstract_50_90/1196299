Two clones were selected for mass cultivation from 18 phenotypically stable CHM-resistant CHO clones. The polysomes isolated from these two clones were compared with CHO wildtype polysomes and rat liver polysomes in a cell-free protein synthesis system for their ability to incorporate amino acids. CHM had an inhibitory effect on the protein synthesis activity of CHO wildtype and rat liver polysomes, but had no effect on the polysomes obtained from either of the mutant CHO clones.
