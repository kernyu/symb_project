Rifampin-resistant mutants of Bacillus subtilis that are conditionally temperature sensitive during sporulation have been isolated and characterized. The mutants can grow at the same rate as the wild type at the nonpermissive temperature but cannot sporulate. Depending on the mutation, they are blocked at either stage 0 to I, II, II to III, or IV of sporulation. The mutants showed an altered pattern of RNA synthesis after the stage at which they were blocked. The effect of rifampin on the activity of enzymes from mutant vegetative cells and sporulating cells was significantly different, suggesting that the RNA polymerase from sporulating cells was different from the RNA polymerase of vegetative cells. These results suggest that the conformation of the RNA polymerase core plays an important role in determining correct transcription during sporulation.
