Studies of beta-haemolytic streptococci isolated in material received from patients in South-west Essex for a further period of three years showed that the overall percentage of tetracycline resistance has remained almost stationary, varying from 28% in 1963 through 35% in 1965 to 27% in 1967.Ear, sound, and skin infections retain a high incidence of resistant strains, while sputa are still a relatively minor source of such organisms. Organisms isolated from throat swabs have an incidence of resistance closest to the mean.
