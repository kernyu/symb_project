Standard filter paper discs were used to determine the sensitivity of 943 strains of E. coli isolated in 1970-1974 from patients' purulent-inflammatory foci with respect to benzylpenicillin, streptomycin, levomycetin, tetracycline, erythromycin and monomycin. An increase in the specific weight of the cultures resistant to the 6 drugs from 4.7 +/- 1.7 per cent in 1970 to 16.0 +/- 2.6 per cent in 1974 was observed. Strains resistant to 5--6 antibiotis were more often isolated from the urine (64.6 per cent) and the wound content (48.9 per cent) and rarer from the abdominal cavity exudate (23.1 per cent), bile (28.0 per cent) and sputum (30.1 per cent). Most often certain combinations of resistance to benzylpenicillin, streptomycin, tetracycline and erythromycin were found in the E. coli strains tested.
