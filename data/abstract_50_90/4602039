It has been shown that it is possible to investigate the colonization resistance in individual mice by determining the concentration of a certain contaminant (S.R.-E. coli) in the faeces during the first 4 days after contamination. Experimental contamination is contra-indicated in many cases such as in individuals with decreased resistance to infection. Particularly in this group, the value of the colonization resistance should be determined. It appeared to be possible to determine the colonization resistance in such individuals by quantitative biotyping of the Enterobacteriaceae species in the faeces on several consecutive days.
