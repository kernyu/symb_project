The profile of organisms responsible for ocular infections has changed over the past few decades. Although nonresistant and resistant staphylococci still lead the list, gram-negative, mixed infections and anaerobic organisms have become more evident. In spite of more potent and broader spectra antibiotics, resistant organisms still emerge. The therapy of intraocular infections requires an awareness of the latest antibiotics, particularly their advantages, limitations, toxicities, and administration. Iontophoresis through the sclera overlying the pars planum area with small diameter applicators may offer another route of administration which may reduce or eliminate the value of direct intravitreal injections of antibiotics. Reduction of the harmful effects of endotoxins of organismal origin might minimize the adverse effects of intraocular infection, particularly after gram-negative invasion. The choice of antibiotic may influence the quantities of endotoxins released.
