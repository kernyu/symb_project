We studied the clinical efficacy of cefdinir (CFDN), a new oral cephalosporin, in 18 children with ages 2 years and 4 months to 11 years and 4 months with pediatric infections. The diagnoses consisted of respiratory tract infections in 15 cases, impetigo in 2 and balanoposthitis in 1. Clinical efficacies were excellent in 11 patients and good in 7, with an efficacy rate of 100%. Bacteriologically, 9 (64.3%) of the 14 strains of clinical isolates were eradicated. No side effects nor abnormal laboratory findings were observed. We have concluded that CFDN is a useful antibiotic for the treatment of mild to moderate pediatric infections.
