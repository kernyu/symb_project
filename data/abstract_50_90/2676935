Spontaneous ceftazidime resistant mutants were obtained from an Escherichia coli K12 J62-2 expressing the TEM-1 beta-lactamase (mutation frequency = 10(-9). These mutants produced beta-lactamases with similar molecular weights, kinetic parameters and isoelectric points (pI) to the beta-lactamases produced by ceftazidime resistant clinical isolates which have recently been identified in this laboratory. Mutant enzyme A focused as a doublet band at pI 5.3 with an additional weak pI 5.4 band. The doublet co-focused with the TEM-E2 beta-lactamase, produced by a ceftazidime resistant Klebsiella oxytoca isolate, which was originally obtained in a Liverpool hospital. Mutant enzyme B had a pI identical to the TEM-E1 beta-lactamase produced by a ceftazidime resistant clinical isolate of E. coli found in Belgium. These results suggest that the two beta-lactamases in the clinical strains may have come from simple mutations of the TEM-1 beta-lactamase gene.
