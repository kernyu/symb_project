The bacteriological and clinical effect of tinidazole (TDZ) was evaluated in 16 cases of intrauterine, intrapelvic and vulvar infection caused by anaerobic organisms and the following results were obtained. Anaerobes were detected in 16 cases, including 1 case with anaerobes alone and 15 cases with mixed anaerobes and aerobes. Eight different species and 24 strains were detected. A single species was isolated from 9 cases, 2 species from 6 cases and 3 species from 1 case. The main species detected were Bacteroides fragilis and Peptostreptococcus spp. of which 9 strains (37.5%) each were isolated. Escherichia coli and B. fragilis was the most frequently occurring combination. The peak MIC values of TDZ were 0.78 micrograms/ml for B. fragilis and 1.56 micrograms/ml for Peptostreptococcus spp. Most other organisms were also sensitive to TDZ. The bacteriological response of the anaerobic infections to TDZ was 87.5% and overall clinical efficacy was 87.5%. Few side effects were observed.
