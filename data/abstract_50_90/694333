The sensitivity of fowl leptospirae to antibiotics was tested by diffusiometry on solid media in Petri dishes. The method includes two stages: 1) visible leptospirae cultures are obtained by central seeding and incubation during 3--5 days at 28 or 37 degrees C; 2) antibiotic tablets are disposed at 2 cm from the visible edge of the multiplication zone of the leptospirae. The edge is marked with a pencil at the moment in which the antibiotics are applied. Incubation is continued at the same temperatures. The results are read after five days taking as reference the position of the marginal multiplication line. The sensitivity of leptospirae to antibiotics is expressed by arrested multiplication and resistance by advance of the marginal multiplication line up to or even beyond the antibiotic tablets. Fowl leptospirae are sensitive to penicillin, tetracyclin, chloramphenicol, streptomycin, novobiocin, polymixin, pristinamycin, neomycin, erythromycin, and resistant to mycostatin, septrin, rifampicin, optoquine, sulphatiazol.
