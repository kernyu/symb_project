One hundred and sixteen cases of adult patients hospitalized for shigellosis have been reviewed. The most common presentation included diarrhea (most frequently watery), fever, and abdominal pain, while dysentery has been less frequent. S. flexneri infection, as compared to S. sonnei, was more common in elderly patients and in males, and was characterized by a more prolonged clinical course. Abnormalities of serum electrolytes and hepatic enzymes were the most common laboratory complications, most often seen in elderly patients. Most isolates exhibited susceptibility to the common antimicrobial agents used in shigellosis therapy.
