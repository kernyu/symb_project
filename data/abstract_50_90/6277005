In managing bacterial meningitis, the essential rule, stated by Chabbert, is to achieved antibiotic concentrations in the CSF which exceed the minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) Several factors must be considered, related either to the microorganism itself (virulence, sensitivity, density of the cultured sample, resistance to metabolites, inactivation of the antibiotic by purulent CSF) or to the patient (initial site of infection, immunologic deficiency, csf clearance). As to the antibiotic liposolubility, free plasma fraction, and route of administration, are the factors which affect it's passage towards the CSF.
