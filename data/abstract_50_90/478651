The sensitivities of 80 gentamicin-resistant gram-negative bacilli to cefotaxime, cefuroxime, cefoxitin, cefamandole, cefazolin, tobramycin, netilmicin and amikacin were determined. Amikacin was the most active amino-glycoside. However, the percentage sensitivity to cefotaxime of most of the species was higher than, or equal to any of the other antibiotics tested. Cefotaxime was particulary active against Providencia spp., Serratia spp., Klebsiella spp., and Pseudomonas maltophilia, being 16 to 256 times more active than the next best cephalosporin or cephamycin. Clinical trials of cefotaxime are now required.
