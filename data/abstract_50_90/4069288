A group of Pt-complexes was tested in various in vitro and in vivo systems. Murine P388 leukemia for the in vivo testing and three sublines of L1210 leukemia for the in vitro testing of two 1,2-diaminocyclohexane (DACH) derivatives of platinum were used. The effectivity of DACH-Pt(II) citrate and DACH-Pt(II) isocitrate with different ratio of trans- and/or cis-DACH was compared on the sensitive strain of L1210 and two resistant sublines: L1210 resistant to cis-diammine-dichloroplatinum(II) (cis-DDP) and L1210 resistant to trans-DACH-Pt(II) citrate. No cross-resistance was found between the DACH derivatives and cis-DDP. Slightly higher activity of citrate and trans-DACH in comparison with isocitrate and cis-DACH was found both in suspension culture and in vivo testing.
