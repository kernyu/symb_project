A case of chloroquine-resistant falciparum malaria in a non-immune Swiss tourist is described. The infection was acquired in Kenya in spite of regular chloroquine prophylaxis with therapeutic serum levels. The isolated plasmodia showed marked in vitro resistance to chloroquine and sensitivity to mefloquine and pyrimethamine.
