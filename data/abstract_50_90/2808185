Selective plating procedures were used to follow the fate of rifampicin-resistant mutant strains of the obligately anaerobic species Bacteroides multiacidus and Selenomonas ruminantium after their introduction at numbers around 10(7)/ml into the rumen of sheep. Bacteroides multiacidus strain F100 showed an initially rapid rate of loss (49%/h) but subsequently numbers declined more gradually approaching the limits of detection (less than 10(3)/ml) after 100 h. Viable cell numbers also decreased in vitro upon addition of F100 cells to whole rumen contents, but remained stable upon addition to cell-free rumen fluid, suggesting protozoal predation. F100 cells were able to grow in vitro in whole rumen contents in the presence of an added utilizable substrate such as sorbitol, but addition of sorbitol to the rumen failed to enhance survival in vivo. In the case of S. ruminantium, introduced rifR strains persisted in the rumen at levels around 10(6) ml for at least 30 days.
