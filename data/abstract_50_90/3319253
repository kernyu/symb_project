We present two cases of Plasmodium falciparum malaria contracted in Douala despite adequate prophylaxis by Fansidar for one and by chloroquine for the other. Failure of curative treatment by Fansidar for the first case (in vitro chloroquine-resistant strain) and by amodiaquine plus erythromycin for the second. After these therapeutic failures, both patients presented without fever, but with splenomegaly and anaemia. The successful therapeutic was mefloquine.
