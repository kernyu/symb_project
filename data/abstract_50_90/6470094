UniScept (Analytab Products, Plainview, N.Y.) is a commercially prepared microdilution antimicrobial susceptibility system for the determination, in a single tray, of antimicrobial MICs for gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria and those isolated from urinary tract infections. The system showed excellent correlation with the reference microdilution approach for organisms from clinical specimens and with stock and reference cultures. Intra- and interlaboratory reproducibility was high.
