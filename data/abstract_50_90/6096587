Cefotaxime (CTX) was microbiologically and clinically studied in surgery. CTX shows excellent antibacterial activity in vitro against Gram-negative bacilli including E. coli. Klebsiella spp., and Proteus spp. in comparison with cefmetazole (CMZ) and cefazolin (CEZ). Antibacterial activity of CTX is found to be superior to that of CEZ and equal to that of CMZ against Gram-positive bacteria (S. aureus and S. epidermidis). The antibacterial activity of CTX against anaerobic bacteria exceeds that of CEZ and almost equal to that of CMZ. It also showed minimum inhibitory concentration values which, clinically speaking, offer great expectation. CTX is also superior to CMZ and CEZ in its antibacterial activity against P. aeruginosa. Clinical studies were carried out in the group A for which CTX was administered a drug of first choice for postoperative infections in surgery, and in the group B for which CTX was administered as a drug of second choice since the antibiotic of first choice had been ineffective for these cases. As a result, high effective rates were obtained in both groups (80.3% for the group A, and 77.1% for the group B). With reference to the group B, an effectiveness rate of 100% was obtained for the cases in which CEZ had been ineffective and 55.6% was obtained for 10 cases in which mainly combination of CMZ had been ineffective. Side effects appeared in 3 cases (1 case each of tinnitus and malaise, vomiting and nausea, and fever) with an incidence rate of 1.46%. Abnormal clinical laboratory findings appeared in 4 cases (1 case each of leukopenia and increase in GOT and GPT; eosinophilia; increases in platelet and monocyte; and increases in GOT, GPT and A1-P) with an incidence rate of 1.95%.
