The growth-inhibitory effect of itraconazole against 85 strains of mycotic agents belonging to 37 species was studied. MIC values were determined in a microtiter broth dilution method using casitone medium. The widest range of susceptibility was noted for yeasts. More strains of Candida albicans, Candida, spp. and Torulopsis spp. were found to be highly sensitive (MIC = 0.22 mg l-1), a single strain of Candida tropicalis and Rhodotorula glutinis was fully resistant (MIC = 200 mg l-1). Most isolates of yeasts were susceptible at concentrations of 0.19 to 0.78 mg l-1. Itraconazole showed the best activity against the clinical isolates of Aspergillus. Of the 16 strains tested, 12 isolates had MIC values less than or equal to 0.09 mg l-1. The drug was inhibitory for the agents of adiaspiromycosis at a narrow range of concentrations (0.19-0.39 mg l-1). greater variation in the response was noted for Geotrichum candidum (0.045-3.12 mg l-1). Zygomycetous fungi (Mucor, Rhizopus) were mostly highly resistant (100-200 mg l-1). Very susceptible strains of Absidia spp. were an exception. In most genera and species, the results of this study were in agreement with the previously reported data of foreign authors.
