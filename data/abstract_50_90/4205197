Minicells produced by Bacillus subtilis strains carrying the div IV-B1 mutation, (CU 403 div IV-B1 and CU 403 div IV-B1, tag-1), were purified by a procedure which destroys parental cells with ultrasound, but spares minicells. Such preparations generally contain 10(9) or more minicells/ml and less than 10(4) colony-forming units/ml. Purified minicells are resistant to autolysis in tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane buffer, pH 7.5, at 30 C, conditions which result in total lysis of parental cells. Minicells are not completely devoid of autolytic activity, however. The medium in which minicells are produced, the temperature at which purified minicells are incubated, and the genotype of cells from which the minicells are derived all influence the rate of autolysis of purified minicells. These parameters are demonstrated by using minicells obtained from div IV-B1 and div IV-B1, tag-1 strains. Ultrastructural differences have been observed in the products of autolysis of these two minicell strains. Minicells are sensitive to low levels of lysozyme and yield miniprotoplasts when the wall is removed in an osmotically protective environment. Although minicells are unable to grow, they can maintain their integrity over long periods of time, which suggests functional energy metabolism in minicells. Direct measurements of adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) levels by the luciferase assay indicated that minicells can produce ATP. Oxygen consumption, measured by standard respirometry techniques, also indicates functional metabolism in minicells. These findings demonstrate that minicells purified by ultrasound are suitable material for study of physiological processes in anucleate cells.
