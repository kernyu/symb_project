In order to study resistance to DNA damaging agents, yeast DNA segments conferring hyperresistance in this organism to such genotoxic agents were selected for among yeast cells transformed by a yeast genome library based on the multi-copy vector plasmid YEp13. Genetic variants hyperresistant to 4-nitroquinoline-N-oxide, formaldehyde, and alkylating agents were isolated and the respective hyperresistance determinants shown to co-segregate with the vector plasmid. Phenotypical characterization indicated different degrees of resistance, few cases of cross-resistance and differing structural stability of the cloned DNA. By transfer to E. coli and subsequent retransformation of yeast a number of plasmids was shown to stably carry the genetic information for hyperresistance.
