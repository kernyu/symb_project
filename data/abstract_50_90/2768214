The antimycin A or cyanide-dependent appearance of a 36 kDa protein in the particulate fraction was observed in L-[35S]methionine pulse-labeling experiments on cells of Hansenula anomala, in which cyanide-resistant respiration was induced. The combined addition of cycloheximide or anaerobiosis, which block the induction of cyanide-resistant respiration, repressed the synthesis of this protein. These results suggest the involvement of the particulate 36 kDa protein in cyanide-resistant respiration.
