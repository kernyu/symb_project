The in vitro activity of ceftriaxone was compared with those of other recently introduced beta-lactam antimicrobial agents (cefoperazone, cefotaxime, and moxalactam) and with those of cefoxitin, clindamycin, and metronidazole against 227 strains of anaerobic bacteria. The data obtained in this investigation suggest that ceftriaxone, like a majority of the new beta-lactam antimicrobial agents, may be of limited value in the treatment of serious infections involving anaerobic bacteria.
