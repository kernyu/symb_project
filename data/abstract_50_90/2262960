We analyzed antibiotic susceptibilities of urinary isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Proteus mirabilis, and Indole (+) Proteus group to ampicillin (ABPC), cefazolin (CEZ), cefmetazole (CMZ) and gentamicin (GM) in 69 laboratories in 1988 and also studied changing patterns of susceptibilities from 1980 to 1988. Minimal inhibitory concentrations were determined using the agar dilution method (MUELLER-HINTON agar, BBL) with inoculation of 10(6) cfu/ml of bacteria. Ninety to 99% of the strains of E. coli, Klebsiella spp. and P. mirabilis were inhibited at a concentration of 6.25 micrograms/ml of CEZ and CMZ and of 1.56 micrograms/ml of GM. Approximately 80% of the strains of Indole (+) Proteus group were inhibited at concentrations of 6.25 micrograms/ml of CMZ and of 1.56 micrograms/ml of GM. However, resistance to ABPC and CEZ was high, with 83% and 81% of the strains being not inhibited at a concentration of 50 micrograms/ml of ABPC and CEZ, respectively. No significant changes in susceptibilities of the 4 bacteria to the above 4 antibiotics were observed over the 9 year period. No increase was found in the incidence of the resistant strains of the 4 bacteria to CMZ and GM, nor of E. coli and Klebsiella spp. to CEZ.
