In vitro evaluation of 66 epidemiologically distinct, gentamicin-resistant, gram-negative isolates from four hospitals revealed that 92% were kanamycin resistant, 44% were netilmicin resistant, 41% were tobramycin resistant, and 6% were amikacin resistant. Combined resistance to gentamicin, tobramycin, and netilmicin occurred in 30% of the strains. Although the resistance percentage to amikacin was the lowest of the three newer agents, two strains were resistant to all of the aminoglycosides tested.
