Seven patients (one black African and six white Europeans) developed chloroquine-resistant falciparum malaria in East Africa. In vitro studies confirmed chloroquine resistance in three patients, but the parasites failed to grow in the other four patients. Six patients were cured by sequential quinine and Fansidar, one by sequential quinine and mefloquine.
