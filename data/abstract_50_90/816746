The resistance of Ps. aeruginosa to 100 mug carbenicillin and 30 mug gentamicin was analyzed for all strains originating from hospitalized patients between 1970 and 1973. Eighty per cent of all isolates were inhibited by 100 mug carbenicillin and 90% by 30 mug gentamicin (1973). Most Pseudomonas strains were isolated from the surgerical and pediatric departments, however the two departments seem to show different tendencies. It is concluded from the results obtained that resistant strains normally do not survive for a long time in one unit since the pattern of the resistance shows considerable differences six months later.
