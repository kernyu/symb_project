Previous studies had localised the gene (mmr) for resistance to methylenomycin A (Mm) to a 2.5-kb PstI fragment in the middle of a cluster of Mm biosynthetic genes from the Streptomyces coelicolor plasmid SCP1. In this paper, the gene has been more precisely located by sub-cloning, and the nucleotide sequence of the whole fragment has been determined. The predicted mmr-specified protein (Mr 49238) would be hydrophobic, with some homology at the amino acid level to tetracycline-resistance proteins from both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Comparisons of hydropathy plots of the amino acid sequences reinforces the idea that the proteins are similar. It is suggested that Mm resistance may be conferred by a membrane protein, perhaps controlling efflux of the antibiotic. No significant homology was detected by hybridisation analysis between mmr and a cloned oxytetracycline (OTc)-resistance gene (tetB) of the OTc producer Streptomyces rimosus, and no cross-resistance was conferred by these genes. Sequences on both sides of mmr appear to encode proteins. The direction of translation in each case would be opposite to that of mmr translation. This suggests that mmr is transcribed as a monocistronic mRNA from a bidirectional promoter. An extensive inverted repeat sequence between the stop codons of mmr and the converging gene may function as a bidirectional transcription terminator.
