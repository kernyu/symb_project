Twenty-one cases of "Haemophilus influenzae" meningitis occurred over a seven year period. An ampicillin-resistant strain was isolated in three (14,2%), but the percentage of ampicillin-resistant strains rose to 33% over the last two years, in meningitis and to 38% in all patients whose blood or CSF grew "Haemophilus influenzae". One case (4,7%) had severe neurologic damage, and 3 (14%) had minor damage. The estimated duration of symptoms prior to proper treatment correlated with duration of fever conscience depression, and hospital stay. Both of the patients with symptoms prior to treatment lasting over 72 hours had sequellae. Chloramphenicol should be included in the therapy of every patient suspected of having severe "Haemophilus influenzae" infection in our region.
