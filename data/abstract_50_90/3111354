In a double-blind randomized study, 155 male patients with uncomplicated urethral gonorrhea were given 200 mg (one capsule with 200 mg and one capsule with placebo; n = 77) or 400 mg (two capsules with 200 mg; n = 78) of enoxacin orally. The cure rates in the 200- and 400-mg treatment groups were 90 and 92%, respectively. The enoxacin MIC for the isolated Neisseria gonorrhoeae strains ranged from 0.015 to 0.12 microgram/ml. Postgonococcal urethritis was diagnosed in 29 (42%) patients in the 200-mg treatment group and 19 (26%) patients in the 400-mg treatment group. Side effects (nausea, headache, and vomiting) occurred in 2 (3%) of the 77 patients in the 200-mg treatment group and in 3 (4%) of the 78 patients in the 400-mg treatment group.
