Use of antibiotics in infectious diseases is frequent. But such a use is not always based on antibiograms and is often not justified. One of the serious consequences of it against public health is the selection of multiresistant strains. So, the authors carried out some researches to determine the profiles of resistance against antibiotics of the strains of S. aureus which is a pathogen frequent in Togo. Sensitivity of the strains was studied in vitro by diffusion method with gelose. The results show that out of 29 antibiotics tested, the 7 most efficient are: rifampicin (91.5 p.c.), sisomicin (91 p.c.), gentamicin (85.64 p.c.), dibekacin (85.8 p.c.), rifamycin (85.71 p.c.). On the contrary, these strains are resistant against tetracycline (96.02 p.c.), colistin (93.39 p.c.) and doxycycline (92.39 p.c.). consequently, selective pressure of these three antibiotics is very high at Lome. Restriction or temporary suppression of their use commands attention in view of preventing the spread of such resistances.
