Three different single base substitutions were constructed at residue C-1192 in 16S rRNA on a plasmid-coded rrnB operon of E. coli using site-directed mutagenesis. All 3 mutants conferred different levels of resistance to spectinomycin in transformed cells but none affected the growth rate in the absence of the antibiotic. The G-1192 mutant conferred remarkable resistance, permitting growth in 40 mg/ml of spectinomycin.
