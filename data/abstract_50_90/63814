A previously unreported strain of Staphylococcus aureus, resistant to both gentamicin and methicillin, as well as other antibiotics, caused an outbreak of hospital infection involving 17 patinets and 8 staff. In this outbreak none of the patients had received previous aminoglycoside therapy. The epidemic strain was eliminated by the use of strict measures for the control of infection.
