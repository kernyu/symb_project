Two amphotropic-based mouse retroviral vectors carrying the neomycin-resistance gene were used to infect four bovine cell lines. Two cell lines, bovine kidney and spleen cells, were refractory to the infection while two independent bovine cells of apparent embryonic origin were infected by the amphotropic retroviral vectors at a measurable titer. Southern blot analysis reveals the presence of neomycin-resistance gene in the G418-resistant bovine cells. The results demonstrate the successful transfer of a gene to bovine cells of embryonic origin using a murine retroviral vector system.
