In this work the authors stress the importance reached in recent years by the primary resistance phenomenon in pulmonary consumption, and they explain the results pointed out by the examination of 171 antibiograms effected from 1972 to 1975 on patients with pathological forms ascertained for the first time. They conclude by underlining the reduction of the primary resistance when employing common antibiotics and, on the contrary, its rise with the use of the rifampicin which has recently been introduced in therapy; lastly they put into evidence the epidemiological importance of the phenomenon itself.
