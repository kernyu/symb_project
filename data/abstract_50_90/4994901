Chromatographic studies and microbiological assays show that, after oral administration, cephaloglycin is partially converted in man to a biologically active metabolite desacetylcephaloglycin. The antibacterial activity of this metabolite compared to that of cephaloglycin is equivalent against gram-positive organisms but is lower against gram-negative bacilli. Successful therapy of urinary tract infections with cephaloglycin must be mainly attributed to the antibacterial activity of this metabolite. At the present time, it is not possible to assess what influence low amounts of unaltered cephaloglycin have on the outcome of therapy.
