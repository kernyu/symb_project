The features of virus drug resistance are reviewed with examples from studies of herpes simplex virus drug-resistant mutants. Virus drug resistance, compared with drug resistance of bacteria or eukaryotes, is distinguished by its ability to provide information on drug selectivity. Identification of genes in which mutations arise to confer drug resistance defines gene products which contribute to antiviral selectivity. The gene products can then be dissected functionally with the aid of these mutations. Laboratory studies of the frequency of mutation to drug resistance and the features of drug-resistant mutants may have predictive value for the clinic.
