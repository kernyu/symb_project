Lethally irradiated mice were infused with syngeneic, H-2 allogeneic, parental strain, or H-2 heterozygous bone marrow cells. They were injected daily with rabbit anti-mouse interferons (IFN)-alpha/beta or gamma or with IFN-alpha/beta. The growth of donor-derived cells was judged 5 days later by measuring splenic incorporation of 5-iodo-2'-deoxyuridine-125I into DNA. Antibodies to IFN-alpha/beta, but not to IFN-gamma, weakened genetic (both hybrid and allogeneic) resistance to marrow cell grafts. IFN-alpha/beta stimulated hybrid and allogeneic resistance, the latter even in genetically "poor responder" mice. Mice pretreated with silica, which weakens genetic resistance, were stimulated by IFN-alpha/beta to resist incompatible marrow cell grafts; however, IFN-alpha/beta failed to reverse the effects of antiasialo GM1 serum on marrow graft rejection. IFN-alpha/beta did not inhibit the growth of syngeneic marrow cells and did not stimulate resistance to H-2 heterozygous bone marrow cells. We propose that genetic resistance occurs in two discrete steps. In the first step, hemopoietic histocompatibility (Hh) antigens are recognized by one host cell type, and this recognition leads to IFN-alpha/beta secretion by a silica-sensitive cell. In the second step, asialo GM1-positive natural killer cells stimulated by IFN-alpha/beta recognize Hh antigens on marrow stem cells and cause rejection. The defects in resistance observed in genetically poor responder mice and in mice treated with silica appear to involve the first step in recognition. The lack of rejection of H-2 heterozygous (Hh-) marrow cells by parental strain mice injected with IFN-alpha/beta indicated that specific Hh recognition is critical in the second step of genetic resistance.
