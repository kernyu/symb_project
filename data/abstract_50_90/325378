Investigation of tetracycline resistance genetically determined by the plasmid pSC101 and several recombinants of pSC101 containing EcoRI generated DNA fragments inserted at the EcoRI site has revealed significant differences in the phenotypic expression of that resistance. The altered phenotypes of the recombinant plasmids may be the result of the location of the EcoRI site of pSC101, which has been determined to be near the genetic elements involved with tetracycline resistance.
