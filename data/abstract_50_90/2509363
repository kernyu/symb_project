Human recombinant tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) inhibited the growth of Chlamydia trachomatis (L2/434/Bu) in HEp-2 cells. The effect was synergistic with that of gamma interferon (IFN-gamma). TNF-induced resistance to chlamydiae could be blocked with cycloheximide, suggesting that it involves the function of some induced proteins. Tryptophan degradation was enhanced in the TNF-treated cells and was much further increased when the cells were treated with both TNF and IFN-gamma at concentrations at which IFN-gamma by itself had very little effect. Antibodies to IFN-beta blocked the augmentation of tryptophan degradation by TNF and decreased but did not fully eliminate the antichlamydial effect of TNF. Increased concentration of tryptophan in the growth medium (greater than 100 micrograms/ml) resulted in reversion of the antichlamydial effect of TNF. This study suggests that the inhibition of chlamydial growth by TNF is mediated partly through an autocrine function of IFN-beta which, in synergism with TNF, enhances the activity of a tryptophan-degrading enzyme(s) and partly by some other activities of TNF which can be blocked by tryptophan.
