A plasmid was found in Nocardia orientalis (formerly Streptomyces orientalis). Physical characterization of the plasmid DNA indicates a size of 33.5 kb and a single cleavage site for EcoR I. The presence of plasmid, and variation in its copy member, did not directly affect vancomycin resistance or production levels. The plasmid represents the first to be isolated and characterized from a glycopeptide-producing nocardia.
