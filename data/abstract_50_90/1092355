Polyethylene glycol quantitatively precipitates plasmid DNA of molecular weight 6-123-10-6, from cleared lysates of plasmid-carrying bacterial strains, After resuspension and density-gradient centrifugation of the precipitated DNA, it is unchanged in length and in transformation efficiency for Escherichia coli K12. Plasmid DNA can be easily prepared in large quantities by including a polyethylene glycol precipitation step in standard plasmid isolation procedures.
