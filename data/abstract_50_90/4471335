In the course of our program on the antimicrobial and antineoplastic substances from higher plants we have studied many flavonoid compounds isolated from root back of Lonchocarpus neuroscapha Benth. In the present paper a slight effect on sarcoma 180 and Ehrlich carcinoma of cordoin, 4-hydroxy-cordoin and 4-hydroxy-derricin, as well as the only observed effect of derricin on sarcoma 180 were observed. The antimicrobial action of four prenylated chalcones, i.e. 4-hydroxy-derricin, 4-hydroxy-lonchocarpin, 4-hydroxy-cordoin and 4-hydroxy-isocordoin is reported.
