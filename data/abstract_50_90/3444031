Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) were isolated from samples collected from various patients during 1986, and antibacterial activities of 6 aminoglycosides (AGs) (netilmicin (NTL), gentamicin (GM), sisomicin (SISO), dibekacin (DKB), tobramycin (TOB) and amikacin (AMK] and 4 beta-lactam antibiotics (cefazolin (CEZ), cefmetazole (CMZ), cloxacillin (MCIPC) and methicillin (DMPPC) against these MRSA were evaluated. Among these 6 AGs, NTL was the most potent, and its MIC50 and MIC80 were 1.56 and 3.13 micrograms/ml, respectively. Antibacterial activities of GM, SISO, DKB and TOB were weak, and MIC50's of GM and DKB were both 100 micrograms/ml, while those of SISO and TOB were 50 and greater than 100 micrograms/ml, respectively. Frequency of highly resistant specimens to AMK was rather low and its MIC50 and MIC80 were 12.5 and 25 micrograms/ml, respectively. As for antibacterial activities of the above 4 beta-lactam antibiotics, the MIC50 and MIC80 of CMZ were 6.25 and 12.5 micrograms/ml, respectively, and therefore, its antibacterial activity to MRSA is relatively good. However, MIC50's of CEZ, MCIPC and DMPPC were all greater than 100 micrograms/ml, showing poor antibacterial activities. Recently, MRSA became a problem in various fields of clinical practice, and a number of literatures reporting refractory infections caused by MRSA have been published. Since MRSA is featured as multiply resistant bacteria, it is known that MRSA is resistant to the majority of existing antibiotics (penicillins, cephems, macrolides, AGs, etc.). In 1985, we reported results of our study concerning the antibacterial activities of a number of CEPs and some of AGs against multiply resistant S. aureus including MRSA.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
