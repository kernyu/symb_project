Resistance plasmids of a novel type were found in two Haemophilus influenzae clinical isolates. pPJ301 and pPJ302 are 10.0 kilobases in size, carry a Tn2-like transposable element, and are related only by their common beta-lactamase genes to the other two types of resistance plasmids known to occur in H. influenzae.
