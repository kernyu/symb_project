The study of the antimicrobial activity of aqueuos, alcoholic and ketonic extracts from plants growing in Cuba is pursued. Six species of the families Rutaceae, Portulacaceae, Borraglinaceae and Jasminaceae were analyzed, and their activity on bacteria with a human clinical interest was assessed. The best results were obtained from Heliotropium campechianum, Jazminum sambac and Portulaca oleracea.
