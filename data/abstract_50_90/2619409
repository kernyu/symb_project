A total of 2329 Enterobacteriaceae strains in bacterial associations isolated from healthy children and children with salmonellosis were tested for their resistance to antimicrobial drugs. It was shown that the aerobic microbial associations isolated from the healthy children contained higher numbers of strains sensitive or resistant to 1-3 antibiotics while the microbial associations from the children patients with salmonellosis treated with antibiotics contained higher numbers of strains resistant to 6-8 antibiotics. Resistance of the aerobic bacterial associations was mainly defined by resistance of E. coli and K. pneumoniae. The feces of the healthy children never treated with antimicrobial drugs contained strains resistant to them. The use of the antibiotics in the treatment led to increasing numbers of the resistant bacteria and changing species composition of the bacterial associations.
