The comparative efficacy of pivmecillinam and amoxycillin in 243 patients with acute simple cystitis was determined in a randomized double-blind trial. Pivmecillinam was found to be significantly more effective on both clinical and bacteriological grounds. The superiority of pivmecillinam was primarily due to its efficacy in infections due to ampicillin resistant Escherichia coli. Fewer side effects were reported in patients who received pivmecillinam.
