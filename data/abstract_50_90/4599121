Under double-blind protocol, a controlled comparison was made between a new cephalosporin, cephacetrile, and cephalothin or cephaloridine. The patient's primary physician determined the indications for treatment, and the dosage was uniform for each route of administration. Infecting strains of staphylococci and Proteus mirabilis had a lower median inhibitory concentration for cephalothin than cephacetrile; the opposite was true for Escherichia coli and Klebsiella species. The average peak serum level 1 h after a dose of 2 g intravenously was 74.9 +/- 21 and 21.5 +/- 8.7 mug/ml for cephacetrile and cephalothin, respectively; 6 h after the dose, the respective levels were 12.4 +/- 4.3 and 3.7 +/- 0.9 mug/ml. Renal clearances were similar and the plasma clearance was proportional to the serum levels. In the urine, the concentration of cephacetrile was three times higher than that of cephalothin. Based on a percentage of therapeutic potential, success in the treatment of infections with susceptible organisms was 42 and 44% for the two different drug regimens. Initial bacterial resistance was found in about one-fifth of infections, and concomitant therapy with other drugs was practiced in one-half of the treatment courses. Intravenous use of cephacetrile was discontinued prematurely more often than was use of cephalothin, suggesting less tolerance. Although there was no overt toxicity, more than 75% of patients on either regimen had some form of unwanted response to treatment, the most common being superinfection. From this limited but controlled experience, cephacetrile can be considered comparable to cephalothin in antimicrobial treatment and overall side reactions.
