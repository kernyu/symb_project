A menaquinone mutant (SG1) of Bacillus licheniformis has been isolated by selecting for colonies that are resistant to low levels of kanamycin (1.5 mug/ml) but sensitive to the same concentration of kanamycin in the presence of shikimate (25 mug/ml). The wild type (IU1) contained 0.38 +/- 0.02 nmol of menaquinone-7 (MK-7) per mg (dry weight) of cells when grown +/- shikimate, whereas SG1 had less than 0.01 nmol of MK-7 per mg (dry weight) of cells when grown in the presence of shikimate. SG1 had a generation time of 85 min, as compared to 24 min for IU1 grown +/- shikimate. SG1 doubled with a generation time of 28 min when grown in the presence of shikimate. IU1 consumed O2 at various rates depending on the stage of growth. A triphasic O2 consumption curve with maxima at mid-exponential phase, the transition from exponential to stationary phase, and early stationary phase was found for IU1 +/- shikimate and SG1 + shikimate. SG1 grown without shikimate consumed O2 at a low level (10 to 20% of IU1). Normal respiration could be restored to SG1 8.5 min after shikimate addition, whereas normal growth was not restored until 40 min after shikimate addition. Electron microscopic studies of SG1 and IU1 have indicated a morphological alteration in the mutant. SG1 is a dwarf cell as compared to IU1, when grown without shikimate. However, SG1 grown with shikimate became morphologically indistinguishable from IU1.
