The sensitivity to penicillin of about 25,000 gonococcal isolates tested in Australia during the five years to 30 June 1986 was assessed in a collaborative multicentric study. Increasing resistance to the penicillin group of antibiotics was observed during the course of this study and was manifested both as increased levels of chromosomally mediated intrinsic resistance and by an increasing incidence of penicillinase producing strains of Neisseria gonorrhoeae (PPNG). Pronounced regional differences in the levels of intrinsic resistance, the incidence of infections with PPNG, and the endemic spread of PPNG strains were observed.
