Clonal populations were isolated from the mouse mammary cell line, COMMA-D, by transfection with a dominant-selectable gene, pSV2Neo, which confers resistance to the antibiotic, G418. Seven of twenty-four clones isolated retained the ability of the parental line to repopulate cleared mammary fat pads in vivo as ductal-alveolar hyperplasias. Two sublines designated CDNR2 and CDNR4 retained hyperplastic growth potential after multiple passages in vitro with low incidence of tumor formation. A third subpopulation, CDNR1, contained a single integration site for the pSV2Neo plasmid indicating a bonafide clonal origin for this subline. CDNR1 cells displayed heterogeneous growth phenotypes in vivo including hyperplasia, adenocarcinoma, and bone formation. Functional differentiation of CDNR1 cells organized as alveolarlike structures in vivo or on floating collagen gels in vitro was observed as determined by immunoperoxidase staining for the milk-specific protein, casein. Overall, the results indicate that a subset of cells from the COMMA-D cell line may be functionally analogous to stem cells existing in the mammary gland.
