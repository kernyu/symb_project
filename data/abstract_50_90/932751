Cryptococcal infection of the brain as encountered in a tropical country is reviewed. The meningitic form is not uncommon and there has been, in the last decade, an apparent, if not real, rise in incidence in Malaysia as in Singapore. Only exceptionally was there overt evidence of immunological deficiency. Hydrocephalus was present in about three-quarters of the patients with meningitis and shunts were employed readily. The presence of multiple small intracerebral cysts could be suspected clinically but treatment for this complication was ineffective. The antifungal agent used most frequently was 5-fluorocytosine. Resistance to this drug developed in about one patient in four. There is a need for further epidemiological studies and for a continuing search for new antifungal agents.
