Cefonicid, an investigational cephalosporin with a half-life just under 5 hr, was studied by more than 100 investigators in the United States. Of 1,060 cefonicid-treated patients for whom the clinical efficacy of the compound could be evaluated, 91.7% were cured or improved; 95% received a single daily dose. Rates of bacteriologic cure were equal for infections due to gram-positive cocci (89.9%) and gram-negative bacilli (93.2%). Overall rates of favorable response to cefonicid therapy, by disease, were 88.4%, urinary tract infections; 91.4%, lower respiratory tract infections; 95.1%, skin and skin-structure infections; and 91.3%, bone and joint infections. Prophylaxis with cefonicid administered 1 hr before surgery was as effective as that with control antibiotic in reducing the incidence of perioperative infection. For 795 patients who received cefonicid or control drug who underwent gynecologic surgery, prosthetic arthroplasty, cesarean section, or intraabdominal surgery, the reduction in incidence of perioperative infections were equivalent. Resistance to cefonicid developed infrequently (1.3%). Overall safety of cefonicid was comparable with that of control agents except for the frequency of occurrence of diarrhea, which was lower among patients who received cefonicid than among those who received a control drug.
