Since 1980, infections caused by methicillin-resistant (MR) Staphylococcus aureus have been epidemic among Detroit-area parenteral drug abusers. Because of the increasing importance of this pathogen, in vitro susceptibilities were compared for 39 isolates of MR S. aureus from 1980 to 1981, and for 56 strains of methicillin-susceptible (MS) S. aureus from 1972 to 1981, recovered from drug abusers with community-acquired infections. Agar dilution studies were performed at 35 degrees C, and minimal inhibitory concentrations were determined after incubation for 18 and 48 h. MR S. aureus exhibited cross-resistance to other beta-lactam antibiotics which frequently required 48 h for expression. MR S. aureus isolates were also resistant to tetracycline, clindamycin, tobramycin, and amikacin. All MR S. aureus isolates investigated synthesized an aminoglycoside 4'-nucleotidyltransferase. Emergence of resistance to cefotaxime, tetracycline, and clindamycin was noted among current MS S. aureus isolates. Vancomycin, fusidic acid, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, and rifampin were the most active agents against MR S. aureus and were equally effective against MS S. aureus.
