In spite of modern therapeutical concepts chronic osteomyelitis is a disease, which can be resistant to all trials with antibiotics, surgical or other treatments. Since the percentage of bone infections increases by increasing accidents the possibilities of classical treatment are discussed and new therapeutical ideas developed by considerations regarding the pathomechanism. The basical reflections for this new treatment can be summarized with the fact that a chronic infection can only develop in an organism with a lack of immune resistance. As the immune response of an organism can be stimulated by vaccination there is a high possibility to overcome a chronic infection by a vaccination procedure. In fact, first therapeutical results confirm this consideration in chronic osteomyelitis.
