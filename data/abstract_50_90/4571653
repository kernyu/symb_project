Growth of a yeast was observed on prosected cadavers used for demonstration purposes in a medical school. An asporogenous yeast was isolated and identified as an atypical form of Hansenula holstii by analysis of the extracellular polysaccharide. The isolate showed resistance to embalming fluid but was eventually eradicated by addition of picloxidine digluconate to the fluid.
