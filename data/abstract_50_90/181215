A multiple drug-resistant strain of Serratia marcescens (bacteriocin type 18) was isolated from three clinical patients. The isolates were found to carry a conjugally nontransferable, nonmobilizeable resistance plasmid (R-plasmid) with resistance-(r)-determinants against ten antimicrobial drugs: ampicillin, carbenicillin, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, kanamycin, neomycin, streptomycin, tobramycin, triple sulfonamides, cotrimoxazole, and--possibly--nalidixic acid, as determined with exposure to 'curing' agents (ethidium bromide, acridine orange, and sodium dodecyl sulfate) and by the high rate of spontaneous loss of r-determinants. Dyebuoyant density centrifugation allowed recovery of R-plasmid DNA that measured roughly 24 mum in contour length; after 'curing' with concomitant loss of 9 r-determinants, the contour length of the R-plasmid DNA of one isolate (No. SE 154) had decreased to roughly 15 mum, and none was detected in the sole variant of the isolate that spontaneously had lost 11 r-determinants.
