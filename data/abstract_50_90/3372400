Fifty-one strains of Staphylococcus hyicus and six of Staph. chromogenes were collected from porcine and bovine sources in England and Belgium. Antibiotic resistance and plasmid profiles were established. Plasmids associated with resistance to tetracycline, erythromycin and streptomycin were identified in many strains; these plasmids were about the same size as those mediating similar resistances in Staph. aureus of human origin. Many small cryptic plasmids were also seen.
