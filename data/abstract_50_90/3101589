The susceptibilities of multiply resistant clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeurginosa to ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, and several beta-lactam and aminoglycoside antibiotics were evaluated. Ciprofloxacin also was compared with methicillin and vancomycin against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis and group JK corynebacteria. Ciprofloxacin exhibited the lowest MICs and MBCs for 90% of the isolates among all of the antibiotics tested against P. aeruginosa. In addition, ciprofloxacin exhibited excellent bactericidal activity against the gram-positive organisms. Clinical trials are necessary to confirm the in vitro results and monitor for emergence of resistance.
