An outbreak of infection caused by a strain of Staphylococcus aureus resistant to gentamicin and tobramycin and other antibiotics occurred in two wards in a hospital. Eight patients were colonized, of whom six had clinical infections. Previous administration of gentamicin appeared to predispose the patients to infection with the strain. Restriction of the use of gentamicin and tobramycin is essential to preserve their value in serious infections.
