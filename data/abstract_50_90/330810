Although the target of the antimicrobial drug 1-methyl-2-nitro-5-vinylimidazole (MEV) has been shown to be DNA (Goldstein et al., 1977) the drug was ineffective in cell-free systems because it was not activated. Both the rate of metabolic activation of MEV and its antibacterial activity were increased when bacteria were grown in limiting oxygen. Mutants of Escherichia coli which were conditionally resistant to nitroimidazoles and nitrofurans were defective in drug activation. The activities of these drugs against E. coli correlated with their rates of metabolism. The antimicrobial spectrum of the drugs appeared to be related to their reducibility by different species.
