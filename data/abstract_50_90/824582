One hundred and sixty-two cases of uncomplicated gonorrhoea were treated with 3g of amoxycillin swallowed in front of an observer. The failure rate of 2.1 percent was low, but did not reach the effectiveness of the standard gonopen probenecid regime, with which failures are a rarity. There were no side effects. It is suggested that 3g of amoxycillin be combined with 1g of probenecid as the treatment of choice, if an oral treatment regime is chosen.
