A comparative study of the antiviral effect of human immune and leukocyte interferons in homologous diploid cells showed that the resistant condition of the cells produced by interferon depended on the type and concentration of the inhibitor, its presence in the culture medium and time of action on the cells. Reproduction of EMC virus and its cytopathic effect were inhibited to a much greater extent when the cells were treated with leukocyte interferon. The resistance of the cells in both cases was evident as early as one hour after their contact with interferon. The resistance of the cells induced by leukocyte interferon was of longer duration than after induction with immune interferon (greater than 72 h and approximately 48 h, respectively).
