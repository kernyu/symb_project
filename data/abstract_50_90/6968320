Development of resistance during therapy with cefamandole contributes to treatment failure. A simple cefoxitin disk test was recently described which detects a cefamandole-active inducible beta-lactamase not otherwise detectable with cefamandole as the inducer. A case of breakthrough Enterobacter bacteremia due to selection of a resistant subpopulation is reported in an immunocompromised patient. The use of this simple disk test in selected clinical cases is advocated.
