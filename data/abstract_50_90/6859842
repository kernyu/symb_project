During a therapeutic trial of bicozamycin (BI) for traveler's diarrhea, aerobically grown, gram-negative bacteria, predominantly Escherichia coli, were decreased by 2 to 3 logs per g of stool; the number of BI-resistant gram-negative bacteria did not increase. Resistant species were most often Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Morganella morganii, and few BI-resistant E. coli strains were isolated. Cross-resistance between BI and other antimicrobial agents was not found. Resistance to BI could not be transferred or mobilized to an E. coli K-12 recipient.
