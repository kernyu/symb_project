A systemic investigation of wound infection in the horse after operative treatment of large wounds reveals that the age of the wound is of critical importance. The limit for an uncomplicated healing process lies around four hours. The duration of the operation itself is of little significance, the location of the lesion on the body of the horse, however, plays a major role. The pattern of isolated bacterial organisms is discussed in relation to the duration of hospital treatment. It is concluded that a systemic antibiotic therapy is of no value and that a local antibiotic therapy is only indicated in rare instances. Such a treatment undoubtedly favours the resistance of bacteria against various chemotherapeuticals, which unfavourably influences wound healing.
