Fifteen Aeromonas isolates from various human infections and nine isolates from polluted water were identified as either Aeromonas hydrophila or Aeromonas sobria and examined for cytotoxigenicity, enterotoxigenicity, adherence to epithelial cells, and other virulence-associated factors, including proteases, lipases, elastases, and hemolysins. Two groups of organisms (I and II) were distinguishable based on differences in median lethal doses in mice and cytotoxicity for Y-1 adrenal cells. Group I clinical and environmental strains had median lethal doses of less than 10(7) colony-forming units, were cytotoxic, frequently possessed several virulence-associated factors, and had lysine decarboxylase-positive or Voges-Proskauer-positive phenotypes or both. Piliation of Aeromonas was associated strongly with ability to adhere to human buccal cells, and these characteristics were associated with group I strains. Group II clinical and environmental strains had median lethal doses of greater than or equal to 10(7) colony-forming units, were not cytotoxic, and usually were lysine decarboxylase negative or Voges-Proskauer negative or both. Clinical strains in group II exhibited enterotoxigenicity, which was not detected in group II environmental strains. A sobria was more frequently associated with human infections; 13 of the 15 clinical strains were A. sobria, and 2 were A. hydrophila. On the other hand, the majority of the environmental strains (seven of nine) were A. hydrophila.
