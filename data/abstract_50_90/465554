Small liposomes did not change the resistance of bimolecular lipid membranes (BLM) in monovalent ion solution (less than or equal to 0.5 M). The interaction between liposomes containing cholesterol and BLM free from cholesterol in the solution of polyene antibiotic nystatine induced anion selectivity and smooth growth of BLM conductance by 4--5 orders. The addition of the liposomes containing cholesterol and nystatine induced a step-like fall of BLM resistance by 2--3 orders. Both cation-selective and anion-selective steps was observed. The effects observed point to the fusion and incorporation of liposome into BLM.
