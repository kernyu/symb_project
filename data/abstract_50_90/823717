M. tuberculosis is susceptible to peracetic acid as a Disinfectant. However, there is no unanimity how the transmission of Mycobacteriaceae can be prevented and which quantitative requirements are necessary for its action. In practical work protein-like substances and varying numbers of tubercle bacilli are important in the efficacy of sputum disinfection. The tuberculocide effect of peracetic acid is scarcely influenced by such admixtures or by the number of test organisms. A preliminary attempt for killing M. tuberculosis in sputum by means of peracetic acid was successful.
