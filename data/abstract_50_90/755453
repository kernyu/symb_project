Biochemical features and sensitivity to chemotherapeutic agents of 190 strains of Staphylococcus isolated from pharinx and conjunctiva of ophtalmological patients and staff were studied. Each strain was investigated for: pigment, coagulase, hemolysis (alpha-toxin), phosphatase and penicillinase production and mannite fermentation. Twentyfour chemotherapeutic angents were used for sensitivity tests. The Authors emphasize that a positive coagulase test is the best laboratory evidence for pathogenicity of a given strain of Staphylococcus, and that the site of isolation of the examined strains is not related with their biochemical features and sensitivity to chemotherapeutic agents.
