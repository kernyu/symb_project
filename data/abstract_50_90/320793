96 specimens of minced beef, ice cream, soft ice and lettuce were tested for their contamination with E. coli and/or coliforms. Colonies of these contaminants were checked for their antibiotic resistance pattern and it was found that many of the E. coli and coliforms proved to be resistant to up to six different antibiotics. The possible public health consequences of this finding are discussed.
