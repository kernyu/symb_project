By using each of the available colicins, we have isolated a large number of colicin-resistant mutants. They included both receptor and tolerant mutants and each was screened for cross-resistance to all other colicins. On the basis of the cross-resistance of these mutants it was possible to place known colicins into two mutually exclusive groups, group A and group B. Mutants selected as resistant to colicins of group A may or may not be cross-resistant to other colicins of group A, BUT Are never resistant to colicins of group B. The reverse also applies. The mutants isolated as resistant to colicins of group A (A, E1, E2, E3, K, L, N, S4, and X) have been divided into 21 phenotypic classes on the basis of their colicin resistance patterns. These include most of the tolerant and receptor mutants previously isolated, some of which were previously shown to also have an increased sensitivity to certain antibiotics and detergents. Type strains from each of the phenotypic classes were therefore tested for sensitivity to a range of antibiotics, detergents, and surfactants that included all those previously used. With these new data, it has been possible to speculate informatively on the mode of action of the different colicins. We have confirmed the position of previously isolated mutations on the Escherichia coli K-12 genetic map, and located approximately the loci conferring colicin resistance in some of the newly isolated mutants.
