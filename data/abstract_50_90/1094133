Studies have been made of the effect of the DNA delay mutations of bacteriophage T4 on growth and genetic recombination in a number of Escherichia coli hosts. DNA delay mutations in genes 39, 52, 58 (61), and 60 result in abnormally high recombination frequencies. These high recombination frequencies are discussed in the context of other observations.
