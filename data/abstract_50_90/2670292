Before 1949 malaria was highly prevalent in the whole territory of French Guiana. When malaria control based on house-spraying and drug prophylaxis was implemented in 1950 the disease sharply dropped below 20 cases per year. Since 1976 despite vector control malaria is rising again. In 1987, 3,269 cases have been notified giving an incidence of 37.6 per thousand for the whole country population; only four deaths were recorded. All the age groups were concerned but the transmission was restricted to some foci along the Oyapock river (prevalence rate 25%), along the Maroni river (prevalence 2.3%) and in a few places of the coastal area. The main cities remain malaria free. In vivo resistance to chloroquine was observed in 22% of the cases which could be cleared by amodiaquine or quinine.
