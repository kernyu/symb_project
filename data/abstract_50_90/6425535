During the period from September 1981 to March 1982, 363 bacterial isolates were obtained as possible pathogens from 311 patients with lower respiratory tract infections at 12 medical institutions in Japan. Of these clinical isolates, mostly from the sputum, a total of 231 isolates including 19 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, 33 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 90 strains of Haemophilus influenzae, 65 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 17 strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae and 7 strains of Escherichia coli were tested in vitro for minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of 17 antimicrobial agents, and their antimicrobial susceptibility distribution and cumulative percentages of inhibited isolates by increasing concentrations of drugs were determined. The data were further analyzed to investigate the interrelation between such parameters as the age-distribution of patients by diseases of the respiratory system, sex and types of infection and the species and frequency of isolation of the organisms, and also the relationship between the antimicrobial chemotherapy prior to collection of clinical specimens and the species and incidence of the bacterial isolates. In respiratory infections, it is frequently that chemotherapy should be instituted with an appropriate drug even before the causative organism can be identified and assessed for its antimicrobial susceptibility. The present data may provide valuable informations in selecting appropriate drugs in practical, clinical use.
