The late results are analized, of a strictly supervised treatment of 160 patients with pulmonary tuberculosis, of the secondary bacilliferic type, recently discovered, between July 1974 and December 1976. The criterium for assessing the results was the bacteriologic examination. After the first year 144 of the patients became negative (90%), while 16 remained positive (10%). Prolonged treatment, up to 2--3 years also led to negativation of these causes, with the only exception of a single patient that did not cooperate, and who became chronically ill. After one-and-a-half year 2 patients again became positive, of which one died with fulminating hemophytysis, and the second one in cardio-respiratory failure. Another 6 patients became positive after two years, while two other were positive at three years and one each after four, respectively five years. Two are still under treatment, while the remaining patients were all negative for at least two years. At the end of the observation period 155 of the initially 160 bacilliferic patients were considered as solved, and do not raise anti-epidemic problems. It is shown in conclusion that the modern anti-tuberculous treatment can lead to recovery of the majority of patients. Those who are still bacille carriers, or who recidivate, can also be solved by continued treatment for a period of up to 2--3 years. The patients with multiple deficiencies have increased risks to develop relcidives, and they should be followed with perseverance for a long time. The recommended therapeutic regimens are not significantly different from the viewpoint of their efficiency, provided they are administered in a strictly supervised manner. The reactivity of the organism probably has an important role in the efficiency of the modern anti-tuberculous treatment.
