Eighty-seven of 283 isolates of salmonellae recovered from horses in Kentucky by the Livestock Disease Diagnostic Center from July 1, 1980 through June 30, 1984 were Salmonella agona. No isolations of S agona were made from Jan 1, 1972 through June 30, 1980. Salmonella agona was isolated from horses on 56 farms and most of the isolations were made in the spring. All age classes of horses were involved. Clinical forms of salmonellosis observed were diarrhea, septicemia, infertility, and abortion. Antibiotic susceptibilities were determined for 83 of the 87 isolates, and 79 were resistant to multiple antimicrobial agents, including chloramphenicol and gentamicin.
