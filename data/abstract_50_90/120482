A strain of Myxococcus coralloides was isolated which produced an antibiotic active against Gram-positive bacteria and also against Neisseria sp at high levels of antibiotic. The antibiotic was bactericidal on sensitive growing bacteria. It was inactive on non-growing cells and also on cells whose growth has been stopped by addition of chloramphenicol. Strains of S. aureus resistant to several antibiotics, including penicillin and ampicillin, were also sensitive to this antibiotic.
