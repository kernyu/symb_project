The lipid composition of Providencia stuartii has been shown to resemble closely that of Proteus mirabilis. The ability of some Pv, stuartii strains to survive exposure to high concentrations of the antiseptic chlorhexidine could not be explained in terms of differences in lipid content between sensitive and resistant strains. In addition, resistance could not be attributed to either reduced adsorption of the antiseptic or to its gross enzymic degradation.
