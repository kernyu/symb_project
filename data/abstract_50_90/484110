To receive objective informations about clinically supposed difference of bacteria spectrum in hospital infections within the last 20 years, we made statistical comparatively investigations between varying periods and in different fields. In the whole material of the Medical Department we found an increase of Proteus, Pseudomonas and Klebsiella (p = 0,01%) and an increase of Candida while Staphylococci, Streptococci, Pneumococci, Clostridium and Meningococci have clearly decreased. In the Department of Nephrology we found a significant increase of Proteus and Pseudomonas (in regard to the manifold findings also of Klebsiella) and a significant decrease of Enterococci (in regard to the manifold findings also of E. coli). In the Reanimation Department there were in opposite to a strong increase of Candida, followed by Pseudomonas, Klebsiella, Enterobacter and Pneumococci, a decrease of Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococci and Streptococci in the sputum findings. In the Urological Clinic while the period of report Pseudomonas and Enterobacter increased significantly, Staphlococcus aureus and Streptococci decreased significantly. In the Neurosurgical Clinic the part of the gramnegative germs of all germinal isolations increased from 8,3% to 51,5% at which especially E. coli, Enterobacter and Pseudomonas were more often found.
