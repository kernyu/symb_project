The clinical course of six patients with erythema migrans of Lyme disease was viewed in the context of antibiotic susceptibility studies of their own Borrelia burgdorferi isolates. An initial poor response by two patients to antibiotic therapy suggested the possibility of B. burgdorferi resistance to these agents. Minimum bactericidal concentration determinations of eight antimicrobial agents against these isolates did not support this suggestion.
