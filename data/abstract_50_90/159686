The effectiveness of a lytic enzyme preparation (Elase--Parke-Davis) plus natamycin (Pimafucin--Gist-Brocades) was compared to natamycin therapy alone in a controlled clinical trial involving 120 patients suffering from monilial vulvo-vaginitis. The results indicate that addition of Elase to a natamycin treatment regimen increases the effectiveness of therapy both with respect to alleviation of symptoms and to eradication of the organism as determined by vaginal culture in patients with acute infection and in those in whom infection is complicated by pregnancy or diabetes.
