The effect of prodigiozan and pyrimidine derivatives, such as methyluracyl, oxymetacyl and 2-methyl-4-amino-6-hydroxypyrimidine on the efficiency of antibiotic therapy of experimental infections caused by Staph. aures and E. Coli under conditions of immune depression due to levomycetin, prednisolone, 6-mercaptopurine and ionizing radiation was studied. The effect of prodigiozan on the efficiency of the antibiotic treatment of staphylococcal infection in the presence of the immune depression due to 6-mercatopurine, levomycetin and prednisolone was higher than that of pyrimidines. The combined use of prodigiozan and pyrimidines usually was not more effective than the use of every drug alone. The efficiency of the drugs in radiation disease was the same. After prednisolone administration prodigiozan increased the host resistance to the infection without the antibiotic use.
