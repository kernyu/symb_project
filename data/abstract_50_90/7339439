The paper was aimed at an evaluation of nonspecific humoral resistance in CS2 chronically exposed workers. The studies covered 68 men of medium, 16 years, duration of employment in exposure and 20 controls. In all subjects the concentration of lysozyme and some ferrum economy parameters were determined. In the group of chronically CS2 exposed workers the serum lysozyme index was found to be statistically significantly decreased. In addition, in 14.7% of subjects, increased ferrum concentration and increased index of plasmatic transferin saturation with ferrum were found as well as statistically significant decrease in lysozyme concentration and index. The observed changes in the parameters concerned, contributing to the system of humoral nonspecific resistance may result in an increased infectious diseases incidence among the CS2 exposed workers.
