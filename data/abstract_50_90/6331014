Mycelial levels of ATP and glucose-6-phosphate were investigated in mutants of streptothricin-producing S. noursei JA 3880b differing from the wild-type strain in antibiotic formation, in the control by inorganic phosphate of the secondary metabolism, and in the resistance to growth inhibition by toxic arsenate ions. As compared with the ancestral strain, mutants exhibited a lower content of ATP in the mycelium while addition of 0.1 M arsenate to growing cultures provoked only moderate changes in the level of this high-energy metabolite. The results suggest that there exists a correlation between growth resistance to arsenate and insensitivity to phosphate inhibition of the secondary metabolism, on the one hand, and the capacity to produce streptothricin-type antibiotics, on the other.
