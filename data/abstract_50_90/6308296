Studies on T-1982 (cefbuperazone), a new cephamycin antibiotic, were carried out in the field of pediatrics, and the following results were obtained. 1. Peak MIC of T-1982 against S. pyogenes (group A) lately isolated was 0.39 micrograms/ml, and the drug was active even against highly resistant strains of macrolides, lincomycin, tetracycline and chloramphenicol. 2. Peak MICs of T-1982 were 0.78 microgram/ml against B. pertussis, 0.2 microgram/ml against E. coli and less than or equal to 0.05 microgram/ml against K. oxytoca, and the drug was also active against ampicillin-resistant bacteria. 3. Serum levels and urinary excretions of T-1982 were investigated in 6 cases. When given at a dose of 20-28 mg/kg by 1 hour intravenous drip infusion, serum concentrations of T-1982 attained the peak level of 63.5-75.9 micrograms/ml at the end of administration and sustained the level of 0.9-2.6 micrograms/ml at 6 hours, the serum half-life (T 1/2) ranging 70-82 minutes. Approximately 20-72% of the dose were excreted in the active form into urine within 6 hours. 4. Twenty-seven cases of acute pediatric infections were treated with T-1982 mainly by intravenous drip infusion, and satisfactory clinical results were obtained in all the cases of angina lacunaris, bronchitis, bronchopneumonia, pertussis, sepsis caused by Serratia and acute urinary tract infections caused by ampicillin-resistant E. coli. The efficacy rate was 96.3%. In this study the drug was administered chiefly at a daily dose of 50-70 mg/kg 2-3 times a day for 2-12 days. 5. Gram-positive cocci (S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes) and Gram-negative rods (H. influenzae, H. parainfluenzae P. vulgaris, B. pertussis, S. marcescens, E. coli) were eradicated by the treatment with T-1982. 6. No noticeable side effects were observed, except for temporary increase of eosinophil in 2 cases and slight elevation of GOT in 1 case.
