Tosufloxacin (A-61827) is the tosylate salt of A-60969 (T-3262). Temafloxacin (A-62254) is the hydrochloride salt of A-63004. Both compounds were tested against 945 aerobic bacterial isolates and their in-vitro activities were compared to those of five other fluoroquinolones. Ciprofloxacin and tosufloxacin were similar in their activity against the Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas species. Temafloxacin and ofloxacin were similar in their activity against the Gram-negative bacilli. Strains that were susceptible to ciprofloxacin were also susceptible to ofloxacin, temafloxacin and tosufloxacin. Against nalidixic acid-resistant enteric bacilli, the potency of all seven fluoroquinolones was compromised. Enoxacin and fleroxacin were the least active drugs against Gram-positive species. Tosufloxacin was particularly active against the Gram-positive species; ciprofloxacin, difloxacin and temafloxacin were less active.
