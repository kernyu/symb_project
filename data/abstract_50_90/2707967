This experiment was designed to study, over a 5-year-period, the effect of different frequencies of treatment with three different anthelmintic groups, namely, benzimidazoles, levamisole and ivermectin, and different frequencies of alternation between them, on existing levels of anthelmintic resistance in the nematode parasites Haemonchus contortus and Trichostrongylus colubriformis of grazing sheep. No evidence of ivermectin resistance emerged, even in suppressively treated groups. Likewise, H. contortus failed to develop resistance to levamisole under a similar selection regimen. Thiabendazole was shown to select positively against levamisole resistance in T. colubriformis resulting in significantly greater susceptibility to this drug than for the natural reversion which occurred in the untreated control. There was no evidence that an anthelmintic treatment combined with a movement of sheep to pastures of low infectivity selected more rapidly for resistance than where the same number of treatments were given to set-stocked sheep. Rotation between anthelmintic groups at yearly intervals appeared to be more beneficial in delaying resistance than rotation of drugs with each treatment.
