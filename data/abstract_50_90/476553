The fecal bacterial flora of swine receiving a ration supplemented with chlortetracycline, sulfamethazine, and penicillin was tested for resistance to chlortetracycline and sulfamethazine using anaerobic techniques and medium M-10. Approximately 15.5 and 1.4% of the flora grew in the presence of 25 and 100 microgram of tetracycline/mL, respectively. Higher numbers of bacteria grew in the presence of similar concentrations of sulfamethazine. Thirty-five chlortetracycline-resistant isolates were tentatively identified by genera. Nine different genera were identified, four of these were Gram-positive and five were Gram-negative. The most common genera isolated were Streptococcus and Eubacterium. This demonstrates that in the fecal flora of swine fed rations supplemented with chlortetra-cycline, a wide variety of bacterial genera can be resistant to this antibiotic.
