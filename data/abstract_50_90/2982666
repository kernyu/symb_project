The gene encoding streptomycin 6-kinase involved in the self-resistance of the streptomycin-producing Streptomyces griseus HUT 6037 was cloned in the plasmid vector pIJ703. The resulting plasmid, pSP6, contained 2.5 kb inserts of S. griseus DNA. When streptomycin-susceptible S. lividans 1326 was retransformed with pSP6, all transformants produced streptomycin 6-kinase. Addition of streptomycin to the culture medium of S. lividans carrying pSP6 plasmid brought about a remarkable increase in streptomycin 6-kinase activity in the cell extracts. It is suggested from the results that the production of streptomycin 6-kinase in streptomycin producer was induced by streptomycin accumulated during cultivation.
