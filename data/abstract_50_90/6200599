The ability to resist staining by N epsilon-dansyl-L-lysine is tenuously maintained in the majority of live nucleated cells taken from tissues concerned with immune function. Resistance is lost under a variety of nonphysiological conditions known to, or likely to, cause protein denaturation or aggregation. In contrast to that of dansyl-gamma-aminobutyrate, the fluorescence intensity of N epsilon-dansyl-L-lysine is only weakly enhanced by native proteins. This is further reduced on denaturation or aggregation of the proteins. It is unlikely, therefore, that cellular uptake of, and staining by, N epsilon-dansyl-L-lysine is a direct consequence of membrane protein denaturation/aggregation but may result from a decrease in protein-phospholipid interactions leading to formation of phospholipid domains. Previous work has indicated that such features are stained by N epsilon-dansyl-L-lysine (Humphries, G.M.K., Lovejoy, J.P., 1983, Biophys. J. 42:307-310; Humphries, G.M.K., Lovejoy, J.R., 1983, Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 111:768-774). Although it appears likely that passage through a dansyl-lysine-staining state is a common, if not universal, prelude to cell death (as monitored by uptake of trypan blue), not all cells that lose resistance to dansyl-lysine staining are moribund. Resistance to staining is also lost by macrophages on binding to solid substrates and multivalent ligands. The possible physiological significance of this is discussed.
