A strain of Staphylococcus aureus was constructed with which to compare transfer of resistance plasmids by the mechanisms of phage-mediated conjugation and conjugation. Transfer by each mechanism could be distinguished by the patterns of resistances transferred. Conjugation was favoured on dry absorbent surfaces, e.g., human skin, tissue and surgical gauze, whereas phage-mediated conjugation was favoured in fluids, e.g., milk and urine. The degree of hydration of the mating cells is postulated as one factor determining whether plasmids are transferred by phage-mediated conjugation or conjugation. Preliminary evidence indicates that topical creams and ointments affect the conjugative transfer of plasmids.
