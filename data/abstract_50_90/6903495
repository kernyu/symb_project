The in vitro sensitivity against fosfomycin, oxacillin and penicillin G was tested in 65 Staphylococcus aureus strains, 71 coagulase negative staphylococci and 46 micrococci. Fosfomycin was very effective against staphylococci. Cross resistance with simultaneously tested penicillins could not be demonstrated. Fosfomycin was only partially effective against micrococci for which penicillin G was most effective.
