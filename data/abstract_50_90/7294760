Sensitivity of staphylococci isolated from the pathological material of outpatients with purulent inflammatory infections and inpatients was studied with respect to 10 antibiotics. The agar diffusion method with standard paper discs impregnated with the antibiotics was used. It was shown that the majority of the staphylococcal cultures isolated from the outpatients was sensitive to the aminoglycoside antibiotics: neomycin 89.7 per cent, monomycin 87.3 per cent and kanamycin 82.9 per cent. The sensitivity of the isolates to benzylpenicillin, levomycetin, erythromycin and oleandomycin was lower and amounted to 63.5, 64.6, 66 and 69 per cent respectively. The sensitivity of the cultures isolated from the inpatients to benzylpenicillin, erythromycin, oleandomycin and levomycetin amounted to 43.4, 45.5, and 49.5 and 53.3 per cent respectively. The comparative study on the antibiotic resistance pattern showed that more than a half of the cultures isolated from the inpatients were polyresistant (resistance to 4--10 antibiotics). The number of such cultures isolated from the outpatients amounted to 32.8 per cent. Cultures sensitive to all of the antibiotics tested and resistant to 1, 2 or 3 of them predominated in this group of the isolates.
