The pharmacokinetics of sulfadiazine (SD) were studied and acute urinary tract infections treated with lower than usual doses of SD (500 mg twice daily and 250 mg twice daily). The therapeutic results were further compared to those obtained with a conventional dose of sulfamethoxazole (SM, 1000 mg twice daily). With both doses of SD adequate drug concentrations in serum and urine were obtained. The treatment results were equal to those with SM. The results of the trial were comparable to those generally achieved with sulfonamides in the treatment of acute urinary tract infections.
