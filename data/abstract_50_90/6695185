Noninvasive photoacoustic spectroscopy was used to study the malaria parasites Plasmodium chabaudi and Plasmodium berghei, their pigment, and ferriprotoporphyrin IX, which is a by-product of the hemoglobin that the parasite ingests. The results indicate that the pigment consists of ferriprotophorphyrin self-aggregates and a noncovalent complex of ferriprotoporphyrin and protein. Spectra of chloroquine-treated parasites reveal in situ interaction between the drug and ferriprotoporphyrin. Chloroquine-resistant parasites, readily distinguishable by this method, appear to degrade hemoglobin only partially.
