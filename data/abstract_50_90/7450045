The antibacterial activity of some ureido, acylureido and carbamoylureido derivatives of cephalexin and cefadroxil, prepared in our laboratories, as compared to parent compounds is reported. Only the 7-[D-alpha-(imidazolidin-2-one-1-ylcarbonylamino)-alpha-phenylacetamido]-3-methyl -3-cephem-4-carboxylic acid (IV d) and the 7-[D-alpha-(imidazolidin-2-one-1-ylcarbonylamino)-alpha-p-hydroxyphenylacetamido] -3-methyl-3-cephem-4-carboxylic acid (V c) showed some antibiotic activity. However we found no activity improvement against Pseudomonas strains (contrary to the results obtained in similar penicillin derivatives) and a lower beta-lactamase resistance.
