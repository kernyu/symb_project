Seventy-eight cultures of multiresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), obtained from Australian hospitals in 1981, were studied to see whether they possessed novel properties responsible for their epidemic spread. In general, these strains resembled MRSA from other countries and were probably derived from them; in particular, they did not survive desiccation better than other staphylococci. The majority of MRSA produced lipases, which might be responsible for their invasiveness, and all produced high amounts of beta-lactamase which hydrolysed each of the isoxazolyl penicillins. This may account for therapeutic failure with cloxacillin of flucloxacillin. Control of this epidemic should rely principally on general measures against the hospital staphylococcus.
