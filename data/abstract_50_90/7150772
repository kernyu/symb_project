The effect of exogenous interferon on membrane toxicity and cytotoxicity of mouse tumor cells (MX-II, SA-I, thymomas, IAC) was studied with respect to target IAC-I cells. The treatment with leukocyte interferon made tumor cell membrane toxicity rise by 27-40%, while that with fibroblast one by 30-47%. As a result of the treatment with leukocyte interferon, tumor cell cytotoxicity increased by 26-47%. Antiserum against fibroblast interferon reversed its activation effect on tumor cells. It is assumed that the effect described is linked with the increased resistance of tumor cells as regards normal killers under interferon action.
