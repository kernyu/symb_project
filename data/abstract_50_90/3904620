Products of kanamycin inactivation were identified chromatographically and radiometrically in E. coli 154, K. aerogenes 600 and P. vulgaris 7470. It was shown that the efficiency of kanamycin inactivation in the membrane fraction was 2 times higher than that in cytosol. A decrease in the culture resistance to kanamycin was observed, when the antibiotic was used in combination with the main proteins or phosphonites: a 16-64-fold decrease in the kanamycin MIC. Comparison of the data on the efficiency of the inactivation inhibition by intact cells and in acellular extracts suggests that the effect of protamine on this process is mediated by the cell membrane, whereas phosphonites can also directly interact with the enzymes inactivating the antibiotic.
