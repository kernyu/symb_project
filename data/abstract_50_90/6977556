Hemophilus influenzae may account for 10% or more of cases of acute hematogenous osteomyelitis in infants. H. influenzae osteomyelitis is more often seen in the upper extremities. Two patients with H. influenzae acute osteomyelitis seen at a community hospital are described. The second patient is the first known case of osteomyelitis secondary to ampicillin-resistant H. influenzae. A review of 22 additional cases revealed that meningitis accompanied osteomyelitis in 10% (2/22).
