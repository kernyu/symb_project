Among patients attending a clinic for sexually transmitted diseases, women without gonorrhoea were significantly less likely to be colonised with meningococci than were women with gonorrhoea, men with gonorrhoea and men without gonorrhoea: the respective carriage rates (per cent) for groupable plus non-groupable meningococci were 16, 26, 23 and 31. Considering groupable and non-groupable meningococci separately it was found that women without gonorrhoea were also significantly less likely to be colonised with groupable meningococci but there were no significant differences in the carriage rates of non-groupable meningococci. The association between ano-genital gonorrhoea and meningococcal colonisation of the pharynx observed previously with certain groups of patients most likely results from increased mouth-to-mouth contact in 'high-risk' patients rather than individual susceptibility to neisserial infection. The possibility that there is a difference in the predominant means of spread of groupable and non-groupable meningococci is discussed.
