Increased antimycobacterial activity of Isoprodian (isoniazid + prothionamide + dapsone) may be due to (i) decreased mutation rate for INH resistance provoked in mycobacteria by DDS (in 2 of 3 strains tested); (ii) leakage of K+, Na+ or Ca++ caused by INH and/or by PTH (in all 3 strains tested), and (iii) indicating damages which may increase the low level penetration of DDS into the cell in sub-MIC concentrations as shown by phage proliferation changes (tested in 1 strain with 1 phage).
