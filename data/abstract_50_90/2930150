The efficacy of orally administered propafenone in the prevention of paroxysmal supraventricular dysrhythmias (atrial fibrillation, atrial tachysystole, reciprocal tachycardia) resistant to Vaughan-Williams class Ia drugs was investigated in 10 patients. Propafenone controlled dysrhythmia very well in 4 out of the ten patients, and satisfactorily in another one at a dosage ranging from 450 to 900 mg/day in 3 or 4 divided doses; this result was documented using continuous 24 hr. Holter ECG monitoring. Among the 5 clinical failures, 1 patient had atrial fibrillation primarily at night, and another poorly tolerated this agent which led to interrupt therapy.
