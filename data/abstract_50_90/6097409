Repeated subcultivation of Neisseria gonorrhoeae in the presence of subinhibitory concentrations of antibiotic has turned out as a reliable model to predict the low potential for development of resistance with respect to the beta-lactam antibiotic penicillin. Before large-scale introduction of the new cephalosporins we exposed 5 N. gonorrhoeae strains of different susceptibility to penicillin repeatedly to subinhibitory concentrations of cefotiam, ceftizoxime, rifampicin and penicillin G incorporated into chocolate agar. each time the most resistant representatives of a strain were propagated, on the whole 25 times. While resistance to rifampicin increased readily (all strains became relatively resistant, MIC = 4 micrograms/ml), the same was not true of the cephalosporins. Although their susceptibility decreased, too, no strain acquired partial or even total resistance (final MIC less than or equal to 0.128 with cefotiam and ceftizoxime). The cephalosporins thus rather parallelled penicillin G which hardly induced any increase of resistance. Thus, a quick loss of clinical efficacy need not be feared after large-scale introduction of the new cephalosporins into the therapy of gonorrhea.
