The authors summarize the difficulties encountered in post-therapeutic follow-up of trypanosomiasis cases in the People's Republic of Congo. Systematic controls provide evidence of recontamination and relapses. The geographical distribution of cases indicates the existence of resistance in one village in the Niari district. Among the hypotheses advanced, resistance induced by pentamidine seems to be discarded.
