Microcomputer programs are designed in BASIC for the analysis of 1209 positive cultures and 1056 antimicrobial susceptibility tests on clinical specimens from various sites of infection. A list of antimicrobial drugs of choice by the site of infection is determined on the basis of the computer analysis of the data. The list may be useful to clinicians for initial therapy in critically ill patients and for preoperative prophylaxis before the results of cultures and susceptibility tests are reported.
