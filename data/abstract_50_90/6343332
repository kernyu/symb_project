Antibiotic-resistant Esch. coli were found in 10.6% of milk samples collected from 998 farms in the west of Scotland. The incidence of both Esch. coli and antibiotic-resistant Esch. coli in milk was higher when the cattle were housed day and night than when they were outdoors. Of the 1125 Esch. coli isolates tested 22.2% were antibiotic resistant and of these 42.4% were resistant to more than one antibiotic. Escherichia coli carrying up to six resistance determinants were isolated. The possible implications to animal and human health are discussed.
