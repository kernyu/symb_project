The effect of 2',6'-dimethyl-N(4')-benzyl-N(4')- [desmethyl]rifampicin on viral transformation induced by two unrelated oncogenic viruses was compared. Transformation of Balb/3T3 cells by the small, DNA-containing papova virus simian virus 40 was completely normal under conditions where transformation by the large, RNA-containing oncornavirus murine sarcoma virus was inhibited more than 150-fold. For these experiments a resistant variant of Balb/3T3 was selected that grows well in high concentrations of the drug, is not dependent on the drug for growth, and is probably not blocked at the level of drug uptake. These data show that dimethyl-benzylrifampicin specifically inhibits oncornavirus-induced transformation rather than nonspecifically inhibiting cellular growth or transformation.
