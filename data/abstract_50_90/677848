Antibiotic sensitivity of 142 strains of Salmonella isolated from patients within 1974-1976 was studied. An increase in the number of the pathogenic microbes resistant to streptomycin was noted. Rare isolates highly resistant to ampicillin were registered. The number of Salmonella sensitive to other antibiotics did not practically change. Levomycetin proved to be a rather active drug in vitro. Still, its use in therapy of salmonelleses did not always produce positive results. The use of levomycetin in clinics is expedient only after careful and repeated estimation of antibioticograms.
