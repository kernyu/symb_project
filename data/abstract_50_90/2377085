It is impossible to determine rigidly a net result of the influence of antibiotics on the interaction between parasite and host cells, as many factors participating in this process are not studied. Adhesion of microorganisms is one of the essential mechanisms of the above interaction. Antibiotics with a different mechanism of action in the subinhibitory concentrations affecting viability of microbes either slightly or nowise have been studied for their effect on adhesion on a model of the intestine section of human embryos and experimental animals. Most of antibiotics influenced differently adhesion of the microorganisms, that also depended on the species attribution of the latter. The accelerated selection of resistance during a successive passage via the suggested adhesion system was observed. The data obtained elucidated certain mechanisms of the effect of antibiotics on the microbial populations at the initial phase of the infectious process and under the primary contamination of mucosa.
