Thirty two patients (16 female and 16 male), ranging in age from 13 to 80 years, were treated with pefloxacin (Abactal) at The Clinic of Infectious Diseases and Febrile Conditions. Pefloxacin was applied parenterally in 21 patients with serious infections. 15 of the cases had the signs of verified septicemia, i. e. bacteriemia; 5 patients developed purulent meningitis, i. e. meningoencephalitis; and in one patient bronchopneumonia occurred. Isolated causative agents (Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermis and Gram-negative aerobic bacteria), were sensitive to pefloxacin. In 11 patients with enterocolitis Abactal was also included in the treatment because of the increasing occurrence of the resistance of Salmonella spp. to various chemotherapeutics and excellent "in vitro" effects of pefloxacin to those multiple-resistant species. Salmonella virchow was isolated from the stools of 6 patients. Salmonella enteritidis from 3 patients, Shigella sonnei from one, and in one case the causative agent was not identified. Pefloxacin was applied per os or parenterally in the dosage of 800-1200 mg in the period from 5-9 days. In all the patients (100%) eradication of the causative agents found in stools was done as early as the third or fourth day of the therapy. There were no adverse effects.
