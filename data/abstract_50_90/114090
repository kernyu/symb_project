We have studied 386 strains of Neisseria gonorrhoeae isolated in our laboratory from July 1977 to October 1978, with the Catlin's auxotyping method. The distribution of the four main auxotypes, i. e. (+), (PRO-), (ARG-), (ARG-, HYX-, URA-), is different from those reported by others (in U. S. A. and Sweden). In Strasbourg, the auxotype (+) is prevalent. We have noticed some differences among classes of population. For example (ARG-) and (ARG-, HYX-, URA-) are scarcely isolated from prostitutes and we have found less (ARG-) strains in women than in men. The determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration of 6 antibiotics has shown there was no differences between the auxotypes except for the (ARG-, HYX-, URA-) strains which are more susceptible to all the antibiotics, but spectinomycin. Since August 1978, we have also noticed an increasing of the resistance which is mainly due to (PRO-) strains.
