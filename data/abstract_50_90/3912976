A review of the many past and present therapeutic attempts in herpes zoster is given. Serious candidates are interferon, idoxuridine, adenine arabinoside, and acyclovir. Cumbersome administration and risk of side effects make acyclovir today's choice. The treatment with acyclovir has been improved by the availability of an oral formulation. The development of a well-absorbed prodrug, 6-deoxyacyclovir may in the future replace conventional acyclovir tablets in non-emergency cases.
