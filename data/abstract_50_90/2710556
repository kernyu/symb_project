166 strains of C. jejuni and 46 strains of C. coli were typed against 14 antibiotics using the agar diffusion test. All strains were resistant against Penicillin G, Oxacillin and Rifampicin. Susceptibility were found against Chloramphenicol, Erythromycin, Neomycin, Oxytetracyclin, Streptomycin and Gentamycin. The minimal inhibition concentration was performed for Erythromycin and Neomycin. All strains tested were inhibited by less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml Neomycin, one strain was resistant against 4 micrograms/ml Erythromycin.
