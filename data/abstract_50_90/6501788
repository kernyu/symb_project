Eye drops containing antibiotics are more and more numerous, we prescribe them more and more frequently. We found it interesting first to gather in six lists all antibiotics used locally in ophthalmology and to study for everyone its bacterial spectrum. After that we see which bacteria are most frequently met by ophthalmologists and when (presurgery examination, conjunctivitis, blepharitis, chalazion, meibomianitis, sty, corneal ulcer, lens infection). All this helps the ophthalmologist to choose the antibiotic he prescribes before the bacteriological specimen, with high confidence. At last, we sum up the little that is presently known about penetration of antibiotics into the eye.
