A total of 303 strains of opportunistic bacteria were isolated from our burned patients during April, 1980 to December, 1987. Among which Pseudomonas aeruginosa accounted for 161 strains (54.1%), Serratia accounted for 56 strains (18.5%), just the two species accounted for 72.6% in total. Among twenty commonly used antibiotics, Amikacin and Polymyxin-B were comparatively sensitive. Further reviewing the drug sensitivity of the two species, we found the sensitivity rates were variable among the strains isolated from different sources. To Polymyxin-B, strains isolated from wound surfaces were of 86.1% and 90.7% respectively, from subeschar tissues or visceral organs were of 53.8% and 39.3%, from blood stream were of 44.4% and 40%. It seemed that the drug resistance of the invading organisms was stronger than that of surface ones. It suggested that the Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Serratia play an important role in infection of burned patients.
