In this study gram negative pathogens isolated from wound infections and antibiotic susceptibilities of these bacteria were evaluated by using Sceptor (BBLR) microdilution system. According to the our results, it was observed that Enterobacter sp. were found to be major causative agent with the ratio of 22.67%. The isolated gram negative bacteria have been found to be highly resistant to the most of the antibiotics except amikacin.
