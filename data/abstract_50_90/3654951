A rare case of purulent meningitis caused by vancomycin-resistant Leuconostoc sp. is reported. The patient was treated successfully with penicillin G, and there were no neurological sequelae. We recommend that all gram-positive cocci isolated from cerebrospinal fluid and blood be fully identified so as not to confuse Leuconostoc spp. with more commonly isolated pathogens such as pneumococci and other alpha-hemolytic streptococci.
