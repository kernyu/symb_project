The selection frequencies of cefepime (BMY 28142), ceftazidime, and cefotaxime resistance among Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains were determined. Cefepime-resistant mutants were not selected by cefepime (frequency, less than 10(-11)). Ceftazidime- and cefotaxime-resistant mutants were isolated at frequencies of 10(-5) to 10(-10) and were often cross-resistant. However, cefepime resistance among ceftazidime- and cefotaxime-resistant mutants was rare. Selected mutants resistant to cefepime constitutively produced 40- to 450-fold more beta-lactamase than did the parent strain.
