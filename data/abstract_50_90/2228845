Children with multiresistant Salmonella typhimurium (MRST) systemic infections, in total 246, were diagnosed during the study period. Of these, 220 had MRST without metastatic focal infections and 26 had metastatic focal infections (including 12 patients with meningitis). The median age of the children was 10 months. Diarrhoeal disease, measles and severe malnutrition were the most frequent causes of admission. Fever was found in 99% and diarrhoea in 72% of the patients, with respiratory symptoms in 72%. In 199 (81%) of the patients, the MRST infection was considered to be hospital-acquired. Of the 246 children, 159 were treated with cefotaxime. In this group, 16 of 152 patients died (10.5%). However, of the 87 children who did not receive cefotaxime, 64 died (74%). Relapses occurred in 4% of the patients with bacteraemia treated with cefotaxime. Our study confirms the high efficiency of cefotaxime in treating severe systemic infections with MRST.
