Six hundred and sixty five samples of clinical materials from patients with various pyoinflammatory diseases were tested for obligatory anaerobes. Anaerobes were detected in 148 samples which amounted to 22.3 per cent of the total number of the samples and to 33.2 per cent of the samples with microbial growth. A total of 171 strains of obligatory anaerobes were isolated. Among them 58.5, 24.5, 16.4 and 0.6 per cent were nonsporulating gramnegative bacilli, grampositive cocci, grampositive bacilli and gramnegative cocci respectively. Sensitivity of the isolated anaerobes was tested with the disk diffusion method. The most active drugs against the tested strains were: nitroxoline, rifampicin, metronidasole, erythromycin, carbenicillin and cefotaxim (4.2, 4.5, 9.3, 10.6, 11.5 and 11.7 per cent of the resistant strains respectively). Gentamicin, polymyxin M, novobiocin and cefazoline were the least active drugs (94.6, 78.9, 65.4 and 50.0 per cent of the resistant strains respectively). Metronidasole, levomycetin, nitroxolin, rifampicin and furazolidone showed the highest activity against bacteroids of the fragilis group (0, 0, 0, 8 and 12.5 per cent of the resistant strains respectively) while gentamicin, polymyxin M, cefazolin, oxacillin, novobiocin and penicillin showed the lowest activity (100, 100, 100, 100, 87.0 and 66.7 per cent of the resistant strains respectively).
