Single drug therapy using a third generation cephalosporin of the cefotaxime type is possible in a number of situations where host defenses are intact, the causative microorganism is very sensitive (MIC less than 1 mg/l) and not concerned with phenomena of resistance by mutation, and the antibiotic is able to reach the site of infection at high concentrations. In contrast, the indications for two-drug therapy including an aminoglycoside appear to be better identified in patients with granulocytopenia. The possibility of single drug therapy preceded by a short period of two-drug therapy is also discussed.
