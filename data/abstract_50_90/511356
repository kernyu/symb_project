Bacampicillin was given as tablets or syrup in doses of 400 mg three times per day for seven days to twelve subjects. Saliva, throat and faecal specimens were taken during fourteen days for cultivation of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. No changes in the oral, throat and faecal flora were seen in the subjects receiving tablets while there was a decrease in the number of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in those subjects receiving syrup. No increased resistance to ampicillin were found in the isolated bacterial strains. Bacampicillin was well-tolerated and no gastrointestinal disturbances were experienced.
