The salmonella group of bacteria consists of at least 1700 subtypes and causes widespread gastroenteric disease throughout the world, there being approximately two million cases yearly in the United States alone. An uncommon but interesting complication is the hematogenous lodgment of organisms in other sites of the body with resultant localized abscess formation, often months or years later. We present a review of 15 cases seen in our affiliated hospitals over a nine-year period. Remote salmonellosis most often occurs in patients with underlying systemic disease, such as lupus, malignancy, diabetes, and sickle cell disease, or in association with therapy that suppresses host resistance including steroids and cancer chemotherapy. The most frequent sites of involvement are bone marrow, joints, meninges, pleura, and blood vessels, or in an area of locus minoris resistentiae. The latter include scars, hematomas, fracture sites, prosthetic devices, and neoplasms. Our experience would suggest that these infections, which can remote both in location and time from the original gastrointestinal episode, are perhaps more frequent today than is generally realized. Diagnosis is often delayed because of lack of familiarity with this entity. Treatment consist of either drainage or excision of infected tissue often combined with long-term antibiotics.
