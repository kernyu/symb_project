Antibacterial activity of cefotiam associated with gentamicin, tobramycin, netilmicin, or amikacin against Enterobacteriaceae strains either moderately susceptible (MIC = 4 to 32 micrograms/ml, 14 strains) or resistant (MIC = 64 to 512 micrograms/ml, 22 strains) to cefotiam was studied using the checkerboard method. High rates of synergic associations (FIC index less than or equal to 0.5) were found, with variations according to the aminoglycoside: 65% for tobramycin and netilmicin, 76% for amikacin, and 81% for gentamicin. Activity of cefotiam is increased by the synergic effect of these associations: of the 36 strains tested, 83, 78 and 76% became susceptible to cefotiam (MIC less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml) associated with tobramycin, netilmicin or gentamicin, and amikacin respectively.
