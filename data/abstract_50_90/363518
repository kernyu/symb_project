The transposable genetic element Tn3, which carries an ampicillin (Ap) resistance determinant, has been translocated from a ColE1-Apr plasmid, RSF2124, to the genome of the filamentous single-stranded DNA phage M13. The site orientation of the inserted element has been determined for one such phage, M13::Tn3-15. The insertion is within the intergenic space separating genes 2 and 4 and containing both the viral strand and complementary strand origins. The lengths of both the filamentous phage and the duplex replicative form (RF) DNA are 1.7--1.8 times those of M13 phage and replicative form DNA. Both plaque formation and transduction of sensitive cells to ampicillin resistance by M13::Tn3-15 are sensitive to purified antibodies to the M13 major coat protein.
