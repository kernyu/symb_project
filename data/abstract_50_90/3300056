The Legionellaceae as agents causing pneumonias are widespread distributed and lead to partially very serious diseases, particularly in predisposed persons with impaired resistance. Two of 12 cases observed are reported casuistically. Erythromycin as the drug of choice should be given already at suspicion. Since Legionellosis cannot be differentiated from pneumonias of other etiology on the basis of clinical findings alone, the authors refer to the importance of the relevant microbiologic methods.
