Ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin resistance (MIC, greater than 4 micrograms/ml) was encountered in 45 of 50 clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. None of 20 methicillin-susceptible strains was resistant to the quinolones (P less than 10(-6). Quinolone-susceptible and -resistant isolates did not differ with respect to culture source or bacteriophage type. The future usefulness of quinolones for S. aureus infection may be limited.
