The effect of local changes of resistance that was earlier described in horizontal cells and muscle fibres appears in response to the changes of membrane potential. The local resistance decreased with depolarization and increased with hyperpolarization. In experiments on musculus sartorius of the frog it is shown that the magnitude of the effect increased with cooling to 0 degrees C and reversibly abolished with warming to 30--35 degrees. The effect of local changes of resistance was diminished also by ethanol (5%) and with the increase of pH of perfusing solution to 9--10, the decrease of pH to 3,5--4 increased the effect. Preincubation of the muscle in solution containing colchicine or dinitrophenol did not abolish the effect of local changes of resistance. The nature of the structure responsible for the effect is discussed.
