Aciclovir (ACV) is the most effective drug for the virostatic management of herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections, and the rate of side-effects is low. ACV resistance is rare, occurring only in highly immunocompromised patients (so far about 30 cases have been reported). Dosages and modes of application of ACV in different HSV infections are indicated and discussed.
