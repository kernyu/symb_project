The distribution of serogroups among 156 strains of beta-hemolyzing streptococci from clinical material was as follows: A - 64.1%, B - 3.2%, C - 11.5%, D - 0.6%, F- 6.4%, G - 14.1% (Table 1). Serogroup A was found in pus specimens in 84%, in throat swabs in 67%, and in sputum specimens (x2 greater than 6.64) in only 23% of strains; among clinical diagnoses (Table 2), distribution of this group was as follows: scarlet fever 100%, infected wounds 83%, and otorhinolaryngological diseases less than 70% of strains. From 54% of specimens received, other organisms were isolated in addition to beta-hemolyzing streptococci, In Table 3, the distribution of serogroups (x2 greater than 1) in cases of single and mixed infections is shown for the most frequent types of material received. Combinations of the individual serogroups with concomitant bacteria, above all Staphylococcus aureus, a number of enterobacteria, and Haemophilus influenzae can be seen from Table 4. Staph. aureus was found preferentially in combination with group A streptococci (x2 greater then 6.64). The proportion of mixed infections among specimens of the most important types of material was varying (Table 5): 82% of sputum specimens, 46%of throat swabs, and 39% of pus specimens. As concomitant organisms, especially Haem. influenzae, Staph. aureus (in throat swabs and pus specimens), and enterobacteria were found. With scarlet fever, Staph. aureus was present in as much as 60% of all cases. Ampicillin-resistant strains were isolated among the various concomitant organisms from 22% of all materials and 45% of all sputum specimens.
