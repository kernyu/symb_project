Gonococcal organisms have become resistant to antimicrobials throughout the world. Such resistance is common in Thailand, where 40% of gonococci produce penicillinase (PPNG strains) and over half the remainder have MICs of penicillin greater than or equal to 1 mg/l. To evaluate the effectiveness of cefuroxime against such resistant organisms, a controlled clinical trial comparing spectinomycin and cefuroxime was conducted at Bangrak Hospital, Bangkok, in 1982-3. Of 472 patients who were randomly assigned to treatment, 365 (77%) yielded positive cultures before treatment and returned for follow up evaluation three to 13 days after treatment. Of the 365 patients, 359 (98%) were cured, and no difference between the two treatment regimens was found either by the sex of the patient or by the presence of PPNG strains. The MIC of cefuroxime against all organisms was less than or equal to 1 mg/l. In vitro susceptibilities of gonococci in Bangkok have not changed appreciably during the past two years. Regimens of cefuroxime and spectinomycin are highly effective even for the relatively resistant gonococci in Bangkok. The pharmacokinetics, in vitro susceptibilities, and effectiveness of cefuroxime encourage evaluation of lower doses of the drug.
