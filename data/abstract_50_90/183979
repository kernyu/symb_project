Although requirements for transformation in Branhamella catarrhalis are quite complex, DNA synthesis does not appear to be one of these needs, as indicated by the inability of nalidixic acid to interefere with transformation. Exogenous sources of energy, such as cAMP and cGMP also failed to enhance frequency, suggesting cells may actively engage in energy production to achieve uptake of DNA, or lack a transport mechanism for these compounds.
