The susceptibility to tobramycin of 739 bacteria strains isolated from children treated in the Institute of Mother and Child was investigated. The highest percentage of strains sensitive to tobramycin was observed among Gram-negative bacillus strains--Enterobacteriaceae, among Pseudomonas species in about 69 percent, and in Staphylococcus aureus coagulase positive in only 47 percent.
