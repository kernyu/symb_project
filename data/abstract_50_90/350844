The ability of several Escherichia coli strains deficient in recombination (rec) to survive in the presence of nalidixic acid was determined. Genetic blocks of the RecBC or the RecF pathways resulted in increased sensitivity to nalidixic acid when compared with the wild-type strain. Mutants lacking functional recA, recL, or recB recC recF genes showed the most rapid decrease in colony-forming ability when incubated with nalidixic acid. However, the uvrB gene also plays a role in maintaining cell viability.
