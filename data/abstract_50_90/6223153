1. Tissue concentrations of piperacillin (PIPC) between 80 to 150 minutes after the completion of 2 g/1 hour dripping infusion were 4.6 approximately 6.4 micrograms/g in the uterus, ovary and oviduct. These concentrations were higher than 80% MIC of the causative organisms, including Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Proteus mirabilis, Bacteroides and Peptococcus, isolated from infections in the field of obstetrics and gynecology. 2. The PIPC concentration in the retroperitoneal space exudate reached a peak value of 34.7 micrograms/ml at 2 hours after the completion of 2 g/1 hour dripping infusion and thereafter maintained a constant level. These concentrations were sufficient for the therapy of parametritis. 3. We administered PIPC at 4 g per day for a period of 4 approximately 8 days to 4 patients with obstetrical and gynecological infectious diseases. All cases proved to respond effectively. No adverse effects and abnormal laboratory findings were observed. From the above, we considered that PIPC was an effective and safe antibiotic against infections in the field of obstetrics and gynecology.
