The incidence of shigellosis at the Residencia Sanitaria Fernando Zamacola (Caciz, Spain) and the antibiotic sensitivity of 94 strains of Shigella sonnei and 40 strains of Shigella flexneri, isolated during the year 1979, has been studied taking into account the present status of strain resistance to the major antibiotics. Three epidemic bouts of shigellosis were detected: one in february by Shigella sonnei (16 cases), and two others in august-september and november due to Shigella flexneri (43 and 29 cases). Children 2 to 5 years old had the highest incidence of Shigella infection. Almost all strains isolated were resistant to the sulphonamides (99.77%). Ampicillin and chloramphenicol had little efficacy against Shigella flexneri (95.00 and 92.50% resistance). The percent resistance of Shigella sonnei strains to phosphomycin was elevated (44.69%). All strains studied were sensitive to colimycin and showed little resistance to the combination trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazol (16.42%).
