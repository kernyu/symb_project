The incompatibility reactions of a group of 90 R plasmids, isolated from the fecal Escherichia coli of calves, pigs, and chickens, have been determined against reference plasmids of the incompatibility groups F(11), I, N, P, and W. Twenty plasmids belonged to incompatibility groups F(11), I, N, or P. Forty-nine plasmids were compatible with all of the five reference plasmids. Eight plasmids exhibited marked incompatibility with representatives of two or more of the above groups, whereas two strains showed incompatibility reactions consistent with the coexistence of two compatible plasmids. In addition, 19 plasmids remain untyped because they showed intermediate reactions with one or more reference plasmids.
