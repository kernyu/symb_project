The emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria is a serious threat to public health. Infectious drug resistance, the transmission of resistant determinants from antibiotic-resistant bacteria to antibiotic-sensitive bacterial populations, creates clinical problems that must be addressed. Adequate knowledge of the mechanisms responsible for bacteria resistance is important for ensuring the benefits of antimicrobial therapy.
