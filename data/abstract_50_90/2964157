Using the agar dilution technique minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) with respect to spectinomycin were determined. 92 Neisseria gonorrhoeae isolates collected in a STD outpatient clinic and 160 Neisseria gonorrhoeae isolates collected from prostitutes were investigated. One isolate imported from Asia had a MIC of greater than 1024 micrograms/ml and was resistant. All other isolates, three penicillinase producing strains included, had MICs of 4-32 micrograms/ml and were sensitive to spectinomycin.
