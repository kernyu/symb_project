The proton transport properties of hygromycin B-resistant pma1 mutants which show kinetic defects in the plasma membrane H+-ATPase were examined. It was found that net proton efflux, as measured by whole cell medium acidification in the presence of 25 mM KCl, was similar for normal and pma1 mutant cells. However, in the absence of added KCl, the extent of net proton efflux was considerably less in wild type than in pma1 mutant cells. The cellular membrane potential was implicated as an important factor in regulating net proton transport and was determined from [14C]tetraphenylphosphonium uptake studies to be considerably depolarized in the pma1 mutants. The growth of wild type cells, which is normally inhibited by hygromycin B at 200 micrograms/ml, was found to be resistant to the antibiotic by the addition of 50 mM KCl to the growth medium. These results suggest that the electrogenic behavior of proton transport by the H+-ATPase may be altered in pma1 mutants and that resistance to hygromycin B may be mediated via depolarization of the cellular membrane potential.
