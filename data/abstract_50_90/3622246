Temocillin is a beta-lactamase-stable penicillin with a selective. Gram-negative spectrum of activity and a long half-life. Previous studies in adult patients have demonstrated its efficacy and safety in the treatment of Gram-negative infections. The aim of the study was to evaluate the clinical and bacteriological efficacy and safety of temocillin in children with complicated urinary tract infections. Twenty-two children, aged 3 months to 13 years (mean 5.8 years) were treated with temocillin i.v. at a dose of 25 mg/kg 12 hourly for a mean period of 5.9 days (range 3-12 days). Acute pyelonephritis was diagnosed in 21 patients (one case associated with septicaemia); one patient presented recurrent bacteriuria due to a multiresistant pathogen. Some 20/22 children presented an underlying condition complicating the urinary tract infection (UTl). The causative pathogens, isolated from the urine, were: E. coli (17), Proteus mirabilis (3), Enterobacter cloacae (1), enterococcus (1). The enterococcus and one Proteus mirabilis were found to be resistant to temocillin. Clinical improvement was obtained after 24-36 h in all children with temocillin-sensitive organisms. Bacteriological cure was obtained in all patients with temocillin-sensitive organisms. The two patients with temocillin-resistant pathogens were treated with another antibiotic. Follow-up treatment was given per os during +/- 2 weeks. No adverse reactions or abnormal laboratory values were noted. In the authors' limited experience temocillin proved to be effective and safe in the treatment of pyelonephritis often due to ampicillin-resistant strains in children.
