Anthelmintic efficacy studies involving 49 cattle either naturally or artificially infested with Fasciola hepatica are described. Some of the animals were also artificially infested with Haemonchus placei and Bunostomum phlebotomum. At dosage rates of 3,75 and 5,0 mg/kg live mass rafoxanide was 64,6 and 92,6 per cent effective respectively against adult naturally acquired infestations of F. hepatica. At 7,5 and 10,0 mg/kg it was 37,9 and 55,7 per cent effective against 42 day old liver fluke. At 7,5 mg/kg it was 100, 87,4 and 94,6 per cent effective against mature F. hepatica, fourth stage H. placei and adult B. phlebotomum respectively.
