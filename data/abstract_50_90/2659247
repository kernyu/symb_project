As DNA probes are used more frequently in the clinical laboratory for the detection and identification of pathogens in clinical samples, a means of determining the antimicrobial susceptibility profile of those pathogens will be required. DNA probes directed to specific resistance determinants offer a solution to this problem. Methods of determining the susceptibility of viruses to antiviral agents can also be accomplished with DNA probes. This article explores the advantages and disadvantages of using hybridization methods for susceptibility testing of organisms contained in clinical samples.
