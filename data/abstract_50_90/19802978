The susceptibility of ceftazidime, five other cephalosporins, moxalactam and cefoxitin to 13 different beta-lactamases was determined by means of the spectrophotometric method. None of the bacterial sonicates used as crude beta-lactamase solutions and which were prepared with cephalothin as an inducer, hydrolysed ceftazidime, cefoxitin or moxalactam. In comparative induction experiments one cephalosporinase (class I) was induced to some extent by cephalothin, cefuroxime, cefamandole and ceftazidime, but not by cefotaxime, cefoperazone and moxalactam. Both cephalosporinase-producing strains tested were strongly induced by cefoxitin. With the most potent inducer, cefoxitin, beta-lactamase activity against ceftazidime could not be detected with either of the two cephalosporinase preparations, or with any one of 11 other beta-lactamases. It is concluded that beta-lactamase induction as a result of therapy does not appear to be a factor which should be taken into account in therapy with ceftazidime.
