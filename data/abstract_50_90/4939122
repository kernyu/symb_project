Urinary strains of Escherichia coli from seven geographical regions were typed serologically for O-specific antigens and with phages capable of lysing the majority of urinary isolated. The O antigen groups 4, 6, 75, 1, 50, 7, and 25 were the common ones found. Of the 454 cultures tested, 66.1% were phage typable and 65.2% were serotypable with the 48 antisera employed. Also, 71.6% of the cultures for which an O group could be determined were phage typable. Furthermore, of those seven O-antigen groups implicated in urinary tract infection, 80.2% exhibited a phage pattern. Various phage types were found within an O-antigen group, and, although one phage type associated a high percentage of the time with one O-antigen group, no correlation was observed between other O-antigen groups and phage types. Studies with bacteriuric patients by phage typing showed the presence of two strains of E. coli within an O-antigen group. Serogrouping and phage typing of fecal isolates of E. coli revealed the presence of some O-antigen groups and phage types also found as predominant types among urinary isolates. Phage typability correlated highly with hemolysis of human erythrocytes. Elevated temperatures of incubation and a chemical curing agent were used to enhance typability of cultures refractory to the typing phages. Phage typing, due to its rapidity, ease, and ability to distinguish strains of E. coli within an O-antigenic group, is suggested as a possible method by which a better insight into the epidemiology of urinary tract infections may be obtained.
