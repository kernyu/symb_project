Under aerobic conditions Staph. aureus was isolated in 40%, grampositive germs were as frequent as gramnegative bacteria. Bacteroides fragilis was the predominant germ from material suspicious of an anaerobic infection. For its isolation the material should be sent as soon as possible to the laboratory to be investigated under anaerobic conditions. The author stresses the close cooperation between the clinician and the microbiologist to receive optimal diagnostic results as the basis of an effective chemotherapy.
