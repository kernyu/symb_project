By examples it is shown, that there are various possibilities to evaluate the 5380 microbiological findings of patients. 87 different species were isolated and out of these the most frequent species were determined (S. aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, D-streptococci, E. cloacae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, P. mirabilis and P. aeruginosa). By different graphical manners of representation it is shown, how often (absolute and relative) this spectrum of germs occurred within selected periods. The most frequent sampling spots were bronchial and tracheal secretion with a part of 45% and belonging to these sampling spots the spectrum of germs is shown as an example. The recorded findings are appointed to 1020 patients. The possibility of control individual patients by data processing is demonstrated. As examples susceptibility patterns of three species (S. aureus, E. coli and P. aeruginosa) are shown by different manners of representation--spread of resistant strains to several antibiotics, percentage of resistant strains in a certain period and finally a combination of these manners.
