Possible prolongation of the biological effect of some available immunostimulators such as prodigiozan, salmozan, polyribonate and thymalin by their sorption on aluminium hydrate was studied. It was shown that in comparison to the native immunostimulators the sorbed ones had a more pronounced biological action and provided a more prolonged increase in the host resistance to the causative agents of gas gangrene and typhoid fever. Using prodigiozan as an example it was demonstrated that the observed increase in the anti-infective activity of the sorbed drugs was associated with more intensive stimulation of some immunological factors involved in regulation of host nonspecific resistance. The results of the study are likely to indicate that it was experiment to further investigate the drugs to reveal their efficacy in other infection models and to optimize the schemes of their use.
