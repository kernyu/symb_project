Heterogeneity within isolates of Plasmodium falciparum in regard to drug susceptibility is described from studies with three Thai isolates and some clones derived from them. One isolate (T9), which before cloning was resistant in vitro to chloroquine and pyrimethamine, contained a diverse assortment of clones, some of which were sensitive to one or other, or both, of these drugs. Another isolate (CH150) was initially sensitive to mefloquine in vitro, but, on recrudescence of infection in the patient, developed a number of clones all of which had diminished susceptibility to mefloquine. Drug pressure in a laboratory culture of CH150 resulted in a similar change in susceptibility. Hence resistant clones are thought to have been present as a minority component of the original isolate CH150. On testing uncloned isolates at different times after growth in culture, drug susceptibility showed considerable variability, but clones remained stable. Reaction in vitro of these isolates to some other drugs (amodiaquine, Fansidar, quinine) is also described, and the results are discussed in relation to changes in drug resistance of malaria parasites which may occur in laboratory cultures and under field conditions.
