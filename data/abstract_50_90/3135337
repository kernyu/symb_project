Strains of lactobacilli were cultured from two patients with clinical evidence of infection. Each isolate was found to be highly resistant to vancomycin but inactivation of the antibiotic could not be demonstrated. Lactobacillus isolates should be regarded as potential pathogens. Reliable vancomycin susceptibility testing is required since susceptibility among Gram-positive bacteria in general should not be assumed.
