This study appreciated the efficiency of uncomplicated malaria second line treatment (P. falciparum) in an area with high level of chemoresistance. No therapeutic failure was found with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (Fansidar), and mefloquine-sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (Fansimef), in contrast with a rate of 8% with quinine. The authors discuss the place of these therapeutic, in the treatment of malaria.
