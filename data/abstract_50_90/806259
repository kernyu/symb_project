R factor RPL11 from Pseudomonas aeruginosa determines multiple drug resistance including resistance to gentamicin and carbenicillin. The host range and incompatibility properties of RPL11 are those of incompatibility group P-2. Strains harboring the factor are not altered with respect to the major immunotypes 1 through 7 of Parke-Davis, or with respect to pyocin type by using the 18 indicators of Jones and co-workers. Analytical ultracentrifugation of crude extracts of R factor-containing strains shows a band of satellite DNA with a buoyant density of 1.717 g/cm(3).
