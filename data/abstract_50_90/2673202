Malaria prophylaxis is required of aircrew operating in endemic areas throughout the world. To risk exposing aircrew to malaria without such protection would be to risk significant morbidity and mortality rates, as well as to jeopardize the success of military objectives. Military necessity might dictate the use of mefloquine for prophylaxis where resistance is known to exist, even if such use conflicts with current recommendations. Should chloroquine resistance continue to spread unchecked, mefloquine could well become the prophylactic drug of choice.
