Transformation of Staphylococcus aureus cells with circular duplex deoxyribonucleic acid prepared from plasmid-carrying strains by alkali denaturation and selective renaturation or by dye-buoyant density centrifugation is reported. In all of the transformants tested, the transformed markers became established as autonomous plasmids that were biologically and physically indistinguishable from those carried by the donor strains. Transformation with bulk deoxyribonucleic acid from a strain carrying the penicillinase plasmid, PI(258), gave rise to transformants in which the erythromycin locus, the only plasmid marker transformed, was shown to be integrated into the host chromosome.
