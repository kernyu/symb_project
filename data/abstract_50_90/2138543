A report is given on two neutropenic patients with staphylococcal septicemia caused by Staphylococcus haemolyticus and Staphylococcus aureus (both strains methicillin-resistant) who failed to respond to therapy with teicoplanin. Both strains were resistant to teicoplanin (MIC 16 and 8 mg/l respectively), but remained sensitive to vancomycin (MIC 2 and 4 mg/l respectively). Replacement of teicoplanin with vancomycin led to full recovery of both patients and their discharge from hospital. These two cases emphasize the importance of clinical and microbiological monitoring of patients with staphylococcal septicemia, even when glycopeptides are used for treatment.
