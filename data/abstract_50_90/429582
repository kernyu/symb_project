During the period 1966-77, 24 strains of Flavobacterium odoratum were identified from among strains of Gram-negative, non-fermentative bacteria submitted to the National Collection of Type Cultures for computer-assisted identification. The F. odoratum strains showed resistance to therapeutic levels of gentamicin, tobramycin, amikacin, and carbenicillin as well as to several other antimicrobial agents generally useful in the treatment of infections caused by Gram-negative, non-fermentative bacteria. Two strains isolated from amputation stumps and another three strains isolated in significant numbers from urine specimens were possibly opportunist pathogens. The biochemical characteristics of the 24 strains, the proposed neotype strain of F. odoratum, and three strains representative of a group, referred to at the Center for Disease Control, Atlanta as group M-4f, were compared with those of biochemically similar species which may be isolated from clinical material.
