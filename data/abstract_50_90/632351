Clinical and bacteriological features of nine cases in which Achromobacter xylosoxidans were isolated in Hawaii are described. Five cases were ear infections mixed with other gram-negative bacteria. Colonial morphology, xylose oxidation, peritrichous flagella staining, and antibiotic susceptibility pattern assisted in separating this bacterium from other nonfermentative, oxidase-positive, gram-negative rods.
