Six N-alkylethylenediamines were synthesized and antimicrobial activity of each compound against oral microorganisms such as Streptococcus mutans, Actinomyces viscosus and Actinomyces naeslundii, and some others were determined in vitro. Dodecyl or tetradecyl derivative possessed maximum bacteriostatic activity among the test compounds. On the other hand, killing time of S. mutans in aqueous solution decreased with increasing alkyl-chain length.
