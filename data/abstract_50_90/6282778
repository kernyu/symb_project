A penicillin-resistant strain of Neisseria gonorrhoeae was isolated from a surveyor living in Aixla-Chapelle, who had an acute gonorrheal urethritis after a trip to Asia (Singapore and Bangkok). The susceptibility pattern for 20 antibiotics was tested in sugar diffusion tests, for five antibiotics in agar dilution tests, and for 12 antibiotics in serial dilution tests with determinations of MIC and MBC, respectively. A modified method for the determination of the MIC is described. This method is characterized by an increased clarity of interpretation, reproducibility and avoidance of subjective mistakes in interpretation. The penicillinase production was demonstrated using the clover leaf technique. The isolated strain showed the highest MIC and MBC values for penicillin (MIC 48 micrograms/ml, MBC 64 micrograms/ml) and ampicillin (MIC 96 micrograms/ml, MBC 96 micrograms/ml) and the lowest values for cefotaxim (MIC less than 0.125 micrograms/ml, MBC 0,25 micrograms/ml).
