In 1978, studies on the chloroquine sensitivity of Plasmodium falciparum were carried out in the district of Sennar, Sudan. The results of the in vivo tests showed parasites resistant at the RI level only, but the mean clearance time of trophozoites from the blood was higher than for strains found in many other areas of tropical Africa. The in vitro tests, using the microtechnique, indicated a lower sensitivity to chloroquine in the local P. falciparum isolates than in those of most other African countries. However, similar results have been reported from Ethiopia. The chloroquine sensitivity of P. falciparum from Sennar is close to the critical level of resistance. The in vitro microtechnique was also used to test for the sensitivity to Dabequin, 4-aminobenzo-quinoline, and was generally found to be a suitable and reproducible method, with a greater potential than the standard macro method. At parasite densities of over 100 000 asexual parasites per microlitre of blood the effect of a given concentration of chloroquine was related to the parasite density owing to the selective uptake of the compound by the parasitized cells.
