The diameter of inhibition zones produced by discs of aminoglycosides in cultures of Escherichia coli varied on different Mueller Hinton media (Pasteur, Merck). The minimum inhibitory concentration (M.I.C.) estimated was 20 times greater with Pasteur medium compared to Merck medium. This increase of the M.I.C. was related to the presence of glucose in the medium.
