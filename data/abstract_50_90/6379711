The putative clindamycin resistance region of the Bacteroides fragilis R plasmid pBF4 was cloned in the vector R300B in Escherichia coli. This 3.8-kb EcoRI D fragment from pBF4 expressed noninducible tetracycline resistance in E. coli under aerobic but not anaerobic growth conditions. The fragment does not express tetracycline resistance in Bacteroides, a strict anaerobe. The separate tetracycline resistance transfer system in the Bacteroides host strain V479-1 has no homology to the cryptic determinant on pBF4. In addition, this aerobic tetracycline resistance determinant is not homologous to the three major plasmid mediated tetracycline resistance regions found in facultative gram-negative bacteria, represented by R100, RK2, and pBR322. A similar cryptic tetracycline resistance fragment was cloned from pCP1, a separate clindamycin resistance plasmid from Bacteroides that shares homology with the EcoRI D fragment of pBF4. This study identifies cryptic drug resistance determinants in Bacteroides that are expressed when inserted into an aerobically growing organism.
