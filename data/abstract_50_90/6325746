The combined actions of sisomicin (SISO), dibekacin (DKB) and cefotetan (CTT), cefotaxime (CTX), latamoxef (LMOX), cefsulodin (CFS) against E coli KC-14, S. marcescens T-55 and P. aeruginosa E-2 were studied. The following results were obtained. The combination of SISO-CTT, SISO-CTX, SISO-LMOX, SISO-CFS, DKB-CTT, DKB-CTX, DKB-LMOX and DKB-CFS using the checker board dilution method on E. coli KC-14, S. marcescens T-55, P. aeruginosa E-2 were found to have a synergistic effect and the minimum FIC index values were 0.26--0.50 for SISO and 0.28--0.75 for DKB, respectively. With the killing kinetic method, all combinations tested showed a synergistic effect.
