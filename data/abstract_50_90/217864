Certain mutants of Escherichia coli with an altered permeability barrier have an essentially normal lipopolysaccharide, fatty acid, and phospholipid content, with a slight increase in the membrane protein:lipid ratio. The phospholipid metabolism of the lev and tec strains shows an abnormal response to growth in the selective agents levallorphan and tetracaine, respectively.
