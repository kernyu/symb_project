The relative frequency of penicillinase-producing Neisseria gonorrhoeae strains isolated from Munich STD patients nowadays clearly exceeds five percent. Penicillin resistance is either due to the 3.2 or 4.4 Megadalton plasmid. Similar trends are reported from other European countries. Therefore, treatment with third generation cephalosporins such as ceftriaxone, cefotaxime or others is now generally advisable not only in the Far East and Central Africa but also in Central Europe.
