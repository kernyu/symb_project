A study is presented of indices of unspecific resistance of the body in 63 patients with erysipelas during the acute period of the disease and during recovery. In the acute period of the disease all patients revealed depending on the degree of endogenous intoxication: reduction of the content of fibronectin in the blood, significant reduction of the resistance of erythrocytes--increase of the per cent of peroxidation hemolysis, increase of the content of malonic dialdehyde--an index of disorders of lipid peroxidation, increased content middlemolecular peptides, circulating immune complexes and products of fibrin-fibrinogen degradation. The authors substantiate the expediency of using sodium thiosulfate possessing detoxicating, antiinflammatory and antiallergic antioxidant properties and the capacity to bind circulating immune complexes.
