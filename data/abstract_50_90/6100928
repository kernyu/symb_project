The erythromycin resistance determinant of Staphylococcus aureus plasmid pI258 resides on a 5.3 kb transposon, Tn551. We have determined DNA sequences surrounding the junctions between the transposon and the flanking DNA in the wild-type plasmid, in an insertion into a second plasmid, and in two transposon-related deletions. The ends of the transposon consist of an inverted repeat of 40 base pairs flanked by a direct repeat of 5, thus placing the transposon in the same class as Tn3, IS2, Tn501, gamma delta, and bacteriophage Mu. Interestingly, we find that the terminal sequences of the 40 base pairs inverted repeat are very similar to the ends of Tn3, a transposon which one would not have expected to show any relation to Tn551. This result suggests common ancestry for Tn3 and Tn551. The inverted repeat sequence of Tn551 also contains (with one additional inserted base) the internal heptanucleotide sequence which has been found to be common to most of the transposable elements that generate 5-base pair direct repeat sequences.
