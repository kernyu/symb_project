The biotin-labelled DNA probe for identification of functioning and silent genes for streptotricin acetylation has been constructed. The probe is homologous to sat1 gene of the movable genetic element Tn1825. The simplified modification of the hybridization technique using the biotin-labelled DNA probe is described.
