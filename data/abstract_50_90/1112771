A mutant of micrococcus radiodurans which is deficient in recombination has been isolated after treatment of the wild type with N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine. We have called this mutant Micrococcus radiodurans rec30. The efficiency of recombination in this mutant, as measured by transformation, is less than 0.01% that of the wild type. It is 15 times more sensitive to the lethal action of ultraviolet radiation, 120 times more sensitive to ionizing radiation, and 300 times more sensitive to mitomycin C (MMC) than the wild type. It is probably inactivated by a single MMC-induced deoxyribonucleic acid cross-link per genome. The excision of ultraviolet-induced pyrimidine dimers is normal. There is no radiation-induced degradation of deoxyribonucleic acid. All spontaneous revertants selected for resistance to low levels of MMC had wild-type resistance to radiation and MMC, and the same efficiency of recombination as the wild type, suggesting that the recombination deficiency of the strain is due to a single mutation. Deoxyribonucleic acid from this mutant can transform M. radiodurans UV17 presumed deficient in an exr type gene to wild type.
