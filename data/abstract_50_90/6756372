Both the native intestinal microflora of chickens that protected chicks against salmonellae and Escherichia coli and native turkey intestinal microflora were evaluated for their reciprocal protective capacity in both species against Salmonella typhimurium and a pathogenic strain of E. coli. Nalidixic-acid-resistant forms of the S. typhimurium and E. coli strains were used in seeder-bird and individual-bird challenge tests. Reciprocal protection was provided by native chicken and turkey intestinal microflora in chicks and poults against S. typhimurium and the pathogenic strain of E. coli. The chicken and turkey microflora appeared to be equally effective in protecting the two species from S. typhimurium, but protection against E. coli was somewhat greater in the chicken than in the turkey.
