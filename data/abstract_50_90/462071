Investigations were carried out on 781 S. typhi strains isolated from patients and carriers. Testing of the sensitivity to chemotherapeutical agents by diffusiometry and the incorporation technique led to the detection of four resistant strains: 1 strain isolated by coproculture from a carrier since 1958, resistant to A, K, N, Ca and Cf and 3 strains isolated by coproculture, biliculture and uroculture from a carrier since 1974, resistant to A and Ca. The R factors of these strains were transferred in their totality. The resistant strains did not manifest any particular pathogenicity for the laboratory animal, and their immunogenic potential was below that of the current typhoid vaccine. None of the 781S typhi were resistant to Cmx, C, G, T, Co and Po. Consequently, in Romania Chloramphenicol may be used in continuation in the treatment of typhoid fever, and Cotrimoxazol, Gentamycin, Tetracyclin and Ampicillin are and remain reserve substitutes. The possible unexpected appearance of resistant S. typhi strains demand, however, further control of the sensitivity to chemotherapeutics of all the isolated strains.
