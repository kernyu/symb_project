Clinical study of cefroxadine (CXD), an orally active cephalosporin, for the treatment of infections in the field of obstetrics and gynecology was carried out and the following results were obtained. Fifteen strains were isolated in present study. These isolates were mainly E. coli and anaerobes (Peptococcus sp., Peptostreptococcus sp.). The distribution of susceptibilities to CXD of E. coli was between 6.25 approximately 12.5 micrograms/ml and that of anaerobes was between 0.39 approximately 1.56 micrograms/ml. These results were similar to those of CEX. CXD was used in the treatment of 11 patients (endometritis 1 case, adnexitis 3 cases, bartholinitis 7 cases). In overall clinical efficacies, patients evaluated as better than "good" were 10 out of 11 (90.9%). Skin eruption was observed in 2 cases. No abnormality in laboratory findings was recognized.
