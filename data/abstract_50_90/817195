The relative sensitivities of certain enterobacteriaceae strains obtained from impatient and outpatient material for investigation against trimethoprim-sulf-amethoxazole, ampicillin, cephalothin, gentamicin and tetracycline are reported. The efficacy of the substances tested was very varied, the resistance rates to gentamicin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole being most favorable. Differences in sensitivity could be established between strains from inpatient and outpatient material. Resistance rates were sometimes considerably lower in material for investigation from outpatients. This fact is, among other things, explained by frequent hospital infections with resistant organisms. In addition it could be shown that, by selection of resistant strains in certain areas of a hospital, increases in resistance can appear within a short time.
