We have studied the mechanism of inhibition by interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) of the development of exoerythrocytic forms (EEF) of Plasmodium berghei in the livers of rats. At the time corresponding to the maximum development of EEF (44 hr after injection of sporozoites), the livers of the IFN-gamma-treated rats contained less parasite DNA as compared with controls. Twenty-four to 72 hr later, the livers of both groups of animals were free of parasites; that is, IFN-gamma treatment does not delay the development of the EEF. The decrease in parasite DNA observed in the IFN-gamma-treated rats was due to a diminution in the number, but not the size, of EEF. It appears, therefore, that treatment with the lymphokine either destroys the parasites or does not affect their replication. To study the mechanism of resistance to IFN-gamma of a small population of EEF, we subjected the parasites to four cycles of selection by IFN-gamma. The parasites from the "selected" and "nonselected" populations were equally susceptible to inhibition by IFN-gamma, indicating that the escape from IFN-gamma activity is not inherited.
