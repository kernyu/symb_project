Ten cases of gynecological infection were treated successfully by a new cephalosporin derivative, cefotaxime (HR 756, CTX), which proved excellent in 4 cases and good in 6 cases. No adverse reaction was found to be induced by administration of this drug. Post-administration results were all normal for both renal and hepatic function tests. It is extremely difficult to accurately assess bacteriological efficacy of a drug in treatment of female genital infections. Nevertheless, we determined its MICs for a few number of strains we could isolate from clinical cases. Its MIC against 4 strains of B. fragilis inoculated at 10(8) cells/ml was 25 approximately 50 mcg/ml and was 1.56 approximately 3.13 mcg/ml at 10(6) cells/ml inoculation. Its MIC against 2 strains of Ps. cepacia was 12.5 mcg/ml at 10(8) cells/ml inoculation and 6.25 mcg/ml at 10(6) cells/ml inoculation. These MICs suggest that this drug is a very promising antimicrobial agent for treatment of gynecological infections, as been already indicated by clinical results of this drug.
