Dose response lines for eight benzimidazole anthelmintics and thiophanate were determined, using standardised strains of thiabendazole selected and resistant Haemonchus contortus and Trichostrongylus colubriformis. Against H contortus, thiophanate, thiabendazole, parbendazole and oxibendazole were inactive. Mebendazole was inactive at dose rates of 6.26 and 12.5 mg/kg, although significant activity occurred at 25 mg/kg. Fenbendazole, cambendazole, oxfendazole and albendazole demonstrated significant activity at dose rates equal to or greater than the recommended therapeutic level. Thiophanate was inactive against resistant T colubriformis. The remaining compounds only showed significant activity when used at dose rates in excess of the recommended therapeutic level. These results show that a side resistance exists among the benzimidazole anthelmintics and suggests that changes in dose response lines could be expected to occur if resistant strains are selected with benzimidazoles other than thiabendazole.
