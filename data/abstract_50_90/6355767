The Escherichia coli Tn9 derived chloramphenicol resistance gene (camr) is functionally expressed in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This gene was introduced into yeast cells as part of a hybrid yeast/E. coli shuttle plasmid. A number of plasmid associated yeast mutants overproducing the camr gene product, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (acetyl-CoA: chloramphenicol 3-0-acetyltransferase, E.C. 2.3.1.28) were isolated. One of the plasmid mutants was analyzed in some detail. Even though this mutant showed a 1,000 fold overproduction of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase in the yeast host the level of RNA complementary to the camr gene was not increased. A deletion of 127 base pairs in the region immediately upstream from the 5' end of the camr gene appeared to be responsible for the "up" phenotype of this mutant. This mutation affected the expression of the camr gene in E. coli in a "down" fashion, in contrast to its effect in yeast.
