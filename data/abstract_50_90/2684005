Erythromycin and related macrolide antibiotics have recently enjoyed a resurgence of clinical interest. This is a result of activity against organisms which are becoming more prevalent, particularly in immunocompromised hosts and, in addition, better understanding of the unique tissue penetration properties and potential immunomodulating properties of macrolides. Other features of clinical interest possessed by certain of the newer macrolides include the potential for once-daily dosing, resistance to acid degradation in the stomach without enteric coating, and possibly reduced gastrointestinal side effects. The new macrolides are expected to retain the clinical indications of erythromycin, which include upper and lower respiratory tract infections, skin and skin structure infections, and genital tract infections caused by erythromycin-susceptible organisms. In addition, enhanced activity has been demonstrated in animal models and in vitro against toxoplasma, Legionella, Haemophilus, and Campylobacter spp. New macrolide derivatives also show promise to expand the antimicrobial spectrum of erythromycin to include Mycobacterium and Borrelia spp.
