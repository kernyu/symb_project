It is dealt with the effects of various butycyano-acrylate type surgical adhesives on gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial species. The experimental results show a growth-inhibiting effect on gram-positive germs. Gram-negative germs are not affected. The growth inhibition produced by SO2-containing adhesives is greater than that caused by SO2-free ones. As compared to Histoacryl blue, the Fimomed variants showed a broader spectrum. Furthermore, it was stated that the adhesive exerts its growth-inhibiting effect not only in the monomeric, but also in the polymeric state. A relationship between the gram-behaviour and the antimicrobic effect of the adhesive is taken into consideration.
