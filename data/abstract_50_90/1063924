A new tetracycline (minocycline) and ampicillin were compared in the treatment of 217 adults with common infections seen in general practice. Minocycline had an overall clinical effectiveness comparable with ampicillin, though minocycline was more frequently prescribed for suspected staphylococcal infections with satisfactory results in 25 (26). Minocycline was significantly more effective in vitro against common pathogenic organisms than ampicillin. All strains of staphyloccocci isolated were sensitive to minocycline while 15 (27) were resistant to ampicillin. Minocycline and ampicillin were no different in the occurrence of mild side effects. Dizziness was troublesome for 23 (127) patients on minocycline and resulted in four patients discontinuing treatment.
