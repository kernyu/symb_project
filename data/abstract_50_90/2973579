Following Ambler's observations, B-lactamases can be divided in four classes, probably derived from a very small number of ancestral genes. Class A includes the TEM-type beta-lactamases (TEM-1, TEM-2), PIT-2/SHV-1 and others which do not hydrolyse ceftazidime and other third-generation cephalosporins. The new plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases markedly active against third-generation cephalosporins also belong to class A and the primary structures of few of them are known. All the class A beta-lactamases are highly susceptible to the action of beta-lactamase inhibitors: clavulanic acid, sulbactam, YTR-830, and are devoid of any hydrolytic properties for cephamycins and imipenem. Third-generation cephalosporins are slowly hydrolyzed by the class C beta-lactamases: the inducible cephalosporinases. Thus only organisms which produce derepressed cephalosporinases are resistant to third-generation cephalosporins, but individual variations are known.
