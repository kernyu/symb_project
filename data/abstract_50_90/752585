Serum and bile kinetics are measured after experimental cystic duct ligation in 24 rabbits and after acute stone obstruction in 24 clinical cases. Tissue, bile, and serum levels are compared. The results clearly demonstrate that pharmacologic data alone do not give sufficient indications for antibiotic therapy in biliary tract infection. Expected pathologic bacteria and their actual resistance are considered to be of great importance in the indication of antibiotic therapy.
