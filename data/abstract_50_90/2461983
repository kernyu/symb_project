Serum samples were assayed in 110 workers (59 smokers and 51 non-smokers) at PVC manufacturing factory, the results being compared with those obtained in a group of age-matched healthy controls. Non-smokers had significantly higher levels of immunoglobulins (IgG, IgA, IgM), while in smokers there was an increase in IgM only. Lysozyme levels (LYS) were elevated in all exposed subjects, but there was a highly significant decrease in the total protein (TP) content. Alfa-2-macroglobulin (A2M) and orosomucoid (ORO) were also elevated in exposed workers. A significant increase was found in ceruloplasmin (CPL), with smokers having higher levels than non-smokers. No difference was detected between the examined groups in transferrin (TRF) and alfa-1-antitrypsin (A1AT). Exposure duration did not correlate with any of the assayed parameters. The positive correlation of IgA levels and inverse correlation of CPL with age in the control group could not be confirmed in the exposed subjects where a significant inverse correlation between age and AlAT levels, which was found to be positive in exposed non-smokers, proved to be inverse in the subgroup of smokers. The authors discuss possible explanations of the reported findings.
