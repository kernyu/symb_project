In 116 patients with opisthorchiasis running a cholecystocholangitic variant of the disease course, the characteristics of nonspecific resistance (complement, lysozyme, properdin), cell-mediated and humoral immunity (T- and B-lymphocytes, T gamma-, T mu-, O-, D-, A-cells and auto-rosette-forming cells, IgG, IgA and IgM) have been studied. Essential changes in these characteristics before and after treatment, as well as at the remote periods of dispensary observation, have been established.
