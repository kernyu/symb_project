From the Cape Verde Islands no studies are known about an efficient treatment with antibiotics and chemotherapeutics. Because of this human samples and samples of domestic animals were collected, the different bacterias were isolated and the antibiograms were analyzed by agar-diffusions-test. The human samples consisted of wound-, eye-, anal-, vaginal- and throat-smears, the animal samples consisted of jaw-, anal- and wound-smears. the aim of these investigations was to make efficient treatment with antibiotics and chemotherapeutics possible. The best efficacy had Cefotaxim, Gentamicin and Trimethoprim + Sulfonamid. Very poor were Penicillin G, Aminopenicillin and Cephalexin.
