The uptake of tritiated nikkomycin Z, a potent inhibitor of chitin synthetase, is mediated by a peptide transport system in Candida albicans. Kinetic transport assays with radioactive di- and tripeptides and competition studies suggest that two distinct systems operate in this yeast. Nikkomycin Z was transported through one of these systems, common to di- and tripeptides. A peptide transport-deficient mutant was isolated on the basis of its resistance to nikkomycin Z. The mutant lost most of its capacity to take up dipeptides but simultaneously increased its ability to transport tripeptides. These results indicate that C. albicans handles peptides through multiple transport systems and adjusts their expression to environmental conditions.
