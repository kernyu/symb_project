Rofenaid-40 administered at 0.02% in feed to chickens experimentally infected with Salmonella typhimurium resulted in less colonization and shedding of S. typhimurium than in unmedicated chickens. The antibacterial sensitivity pattern of S. typhimurium isolated from infected birds had not changed after exposure to Rofenaid for 56 days.
