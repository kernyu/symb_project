Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis strains isolated at eight large medical centers in Korea were examined for methicillin resistance and resistance to eight other antibiotics; cefazolin, cefamandole, cefuroxime, cefoxitin, cefotaxime, moxalactam, penicillin G and vancomycin. Methicillin resistance was found in 296 of 1225 strains (24.2%) of S. aureus and 126 of 348 strains (36.2%) of S. epidermidis. Methicillinresistant strains were isolated from all sources with the frequency of isolation ranging from 11% to 60%. From pleural effusion, throat swab and blood, methicillin-resistant strains of S. aureus were more frequently isolated with statistical significance (Chi-squared test, 95% confidence). Almost all of Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and S. epidermidis (MRSE) strains were multiply resistant to one or more tested eight antibiotics. However only 7(2.4%) of 296 MRSA strains and 2(1.6%) of 126 MRSE strains were resistant to vancomycin. Vancomycin was the most effective antibiotic against staphylococcal isolates as well as MRSA and MRSE.
