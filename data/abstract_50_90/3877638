Overgrowth of hybridomas by proliferating spleen T cells often hinders the production of monoclonal antibodies to certain antigens. To overcome this problem we derived neomycin-resistant fusion partner SP2 neoR.1 by transfection of SP2/0-Ag14 cells with plasmid pSVTK neo beta. Hybridomas obtained with SP2 neoR.1 grew optimally in the presence of the neomycin analog G418 at concentrations which blocked the proliferative response of T cells to mitogenic stimuli. The advantage of using SP2 neoR.1 and G418 under conditions where spleen cell proliferation occurs after fusion was demonstrated with hybridomas derived from a rat immunized with mouse helper T cell lines.
