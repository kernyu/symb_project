A strain of Pasteurella pestis, harboring the F'Cm plasmid from Escherichia coli, was able to donate its chromosome to auxotrophic recipient strains of P. pestis. The frequency of gene transfer in P. pestis was approximately 10(-6) per donor cell, 100 times less efficient than gene transfer in Pasteurella pseudotuberculosis, but efficient enough to determine entry times for the markers histidine, threonine, and tryptophan and to show linkage to the markers arginine and pigmentation. An attempt to extend the conjugation system to different serotypes of P. pseudotuberculosis and to Yersinia enterocolitica did not succeed.
