The efficacy and safety of oral ciprofloxacin, a fluoroquinolone, were evaluated in the treatment of infection due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa. 96 infections in 71 patients were treated. Substantial underlying disease was present in most of the patients, and 25 (35%) were seriously ill. 52% of pseudomonas isolates were carbenicillin-resistant, and 31% gentamicin-resistant. The overall clinical response rate was 77%-28 of 35 exacerbations of cystic fibrosis respiratory disease, 17 of 19 urinary infections, 4 of 6 osteomyelitis, and 11 of 15 soft tissue infections. The bacteriological cure rate was 34%-0 of 35 cystic fibrosis, 4 of 17 respiratory infections, 17 of 19 urinary infections, 4 of 6 osteomyelitis, and 8 of 15 soft tissue infections. Ps aeruginosa developed resistance to ciprofloxacin in 25 of 96 infections. Side-effects were generally slight with nausea in 14 (15%) the most common, and there were only two substantial superinfections.
