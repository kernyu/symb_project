We determined MICs of 20 antimicrobial agents for 50 representative strains of four subgroups of Campylobacter-like organisms (CLOs) by agar dilution. Ampicillin, gentamicin, doxycycline, tetracycline, ceftriaxone, rifampin, spectinomycin, nalidixic acid, and chloramphenicol were active against all strains of CLOs. Most CLO strains (83%) were inhibited by 4 micrograms of sulfamethoxazole per ml and by 8 micrograms of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole per ml. Of type 1 strains, 28% were resistant to 8 micrograms of erythromycin per ml. In addition, cross resistance between erythromycin and clindamycin was always present. Type 1 strains exhibited a broad distribution of MICs of metronidazole and streptomycin, whereas all type 2 strains were uniformly susceptible to metronidazole and resistant to streptomycin. Unlike type 1 and 3 strains, type 2 CLOs were susceptible to cephalothin and penicillin G and highly resistant to streptomycin. The type 3 strain was uniquely resistant to cefazolin. The majority of strains were not inhibited by cefoperazone; and all were resistant to trimethoprim. In contrast to Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter fetus subsp. fetus, all CLOs tested were susceptible to 0.5 microgram of rifampin per ml.
