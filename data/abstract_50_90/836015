Netilmicin, a new semisynthetic aminoglycoside derived by ethylation of the 1-N position of the deoxystreptamine ring of sisomicin, was tested in vitro with 4,070 strains of gram-negative bacilli isolated at the UCLA Medical Center during 1975 to 1976, using the agar dilution technique and an inoculum of approximately 10(4) organisms. Results were compared with those simultaneously obtained for amikacin, gentamicin, and tobramycin. Using Mueller-Hinton medium, inhibitory concentrations in broth correlated with those obtained by the agar dilution method except for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, where a 2- to 16-fold difference in susceptibility was noted. For most clinically significant Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa, the activity of netilmicin in vitro was comparable or superior to that of gentamicin, tobramycin, and amikacin with respect to potency by weight and achievable blood levels. Against gentamicin-resistant strains (MIC > 16 mug/ml), the activity of netilmicin paralleled that of amikacin with the exception of Providencia stuartii, which was inhibited by amikacin but not by netilmicin.
