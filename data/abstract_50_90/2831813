Isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, and coagulase-positive and -negative staphylococci were investigated for their abilities, in vitro, to develop resistance to LY146032. Exposure of the organisms to incremental concentrations of LY146032 resulted in MICs 8- to 32-fold higher than those for the original isolates. After three passages on antibiotic-free medium, the high MICs were maintained for the coagulase-negative staphylococci and pneumococci, with a twofold decrease observed for the enterococci and a fourfold decrease observed for Staphylococcus aureus. The frequency of spontaneous emergence of resistance was highest with S. pneumoniae (1.2 X 10(-6) at 16 times the original MIC) and lowest with S. aureus (7.0 X 10(-10) at 8 times the original MIC). For bacteria For bacteria surviving time-kill studies MICs were also higher than were those for the original isolates. Exposure to LY146032 in vitro selected for strains with decreased susceptibilities to the antimicrobial agent. However, the emergence of resistance in vivo is unpredictable and can be evaluated only after prolonged clinical use of the drug.
