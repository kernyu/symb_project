Sensitivity of Shigella, pathogenic Escherichia, Proteus and Staphylococcus isolated from children with acute intestinal diseases was studied with respect to antibiotics widely used in medical practice: streptomycin, levomycetin, tetracycline, chlortetracycline, oxytetracycline and neomycin. The antibiotic sensitivity was determined with the method of indicator discs. It was found that sensitivity of shigella was: 44 percent to streptomycin, 69.5 per cent to levomycetin, 18.5 per cent to tetracycline, 18.5 per cent to chlortetracycline, 23 per cent to oxytetracycline and 94 per cent to neomycin. Sensitivity of pathogenic Eschericia was 28, 33, 14, 14, 25 and 74 per cent, sensitivity of staphylococci was 46, 56.5, 21, 21, 31.5 and 89.5 per cent, sensitivity of Proteus was 15, 31.5, 3.5, 3.5, 7.5 and 52.5 per cent respectively. Cross resistance with respect to tetracyclines was found in all the microbes studie. Intragenera differences in the antibiotic sensitivity were observed among Shigella and pathogenic Escherichia.
