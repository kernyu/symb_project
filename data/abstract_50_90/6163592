This review presents the epidemiologic, diagnostic, and office management of the gonorrhea patient. Better techniques in obtaining specimens from various sites are reviewed. For example, an effective method for obtaining specimens without the use of an anoscope and the utility of the Gram stain in the laboratory diagnosis of gonorrhea are described. Complications, diagnosis and predisposing factors of disseminated gonococcal infections are also discussed. Follow-up management of patients with gonorrhea with emphasis placed on test-of-cure cultures and testing for penicillinase producing Neisseria gonorrhoeae (PPNG) strains in all treatment failure cases is also presented. The cooperation between public and private health professionals and screening programs have lessened the gonorrhea reservoir in the United States. Therefore, early treatment through targeted screening, and epidemiologic treatment to sexual partners are important guidelines in gonorrhea control.
