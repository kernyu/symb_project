1. It was previously shown [Passarella, Marra, Doonan & Quagliariello (1980) Biochem. J. 192, 649-658] that, when mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase from rat liver is incubated with sulphite-loaded mitochondria from the same source, uptake of the enzyme occurs, as judged by a fluorimetric assay of intramitochondrial enzyme activity. Confirmation of sequestration of the enzyme inside the organelles is provided by its proteinase-resistance after uptake. 2. Enzyme uptake into mitochondria is inhibited by enzyme treatment with mersalyl at concentrations that do not affect its catalytic activity. 3. Enzyme uptake is energy-dependent, as shown by inhibition of the process by carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone and by antimycin. ATP and oligomycin, on the other hand, both stimulate the process, but stimulation by ATP is inhibited by oligomycin. These results suggest that uptake depends on maintenance of transmembrane ion gradient rather than direct ATP involvement. 4. Measurements of delta psi by means of the 'redistribution signal' probe safranine suggest no dependence of malate dehydrogenase uptake on membrane potential. 5. Comparison of the effects of the ionophores valinomycin, nonactin, gramicidin and nigericin shows that uptake depends on maintenance of a transmembrane pH gradient.
