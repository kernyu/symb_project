Antibiotic sensitivity of 104 Shigella clinical strains and 104 Escherichia coli strains isolated from patients with acute dysentery not treated with antibiotics in 1986-1987 was studied. It was shown that 100 per cent of the dysentery pathogens and colon bacilli were antibiotic resistant. Strains resistant simultaneously to chloramphenicol, ampicillin, streptomycin, tetracycline, monomycin and kanamycin were the most frequent among the dysentery pathogens. Colon bacilli and dysentery pathogens isolated from the same patient had specific sets of antibiotic resistance markers. Pathogenetic therapy of dysentery and exclusion of antibiotic use for several years did not result in lower numbers of Shigella antibiotic resistant strains.
