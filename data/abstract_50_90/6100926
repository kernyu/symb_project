All chloramphenicol-resistant Escherichia coli strains isolated from piglets in the State veterinary Serum Laboratory, Copenhagen, in 1974-1975 harbored plasmids of IncFII group with largely the same resistance markers. Two strains from 1978 carried plasmids with similar characters. Restriction enzyme analysis of DNA from these plasmids with restriction endonucleases EcoRI, BglII, and PstI shows that the Cm plasmids are extremely closely related; but the patterns obtained (particularly from PstI digests) enable the classification of the plasmids into groups. These bear a strong relation to time and place of isolation so that plasmids isolated on the same farm belong to the same group even when their host strains are of different antigenic types. It is concluded that these plasmids have evolved from a single plasmid.
