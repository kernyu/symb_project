Five strains of Salmonella typhimurium isolated from faeces of infants hospitalized at Trousseau Hospital in Paris have been found to be resistant to third-generation cephalosporins. This resistance is by a transferable plasmid-mediated mechanism. The beta-lactamase gene which encodes for an enzyme similar to SHV-2 has been cloned into plasmid pBR322 and expressed in Escherichia coli RR1.
