A wild-type strain of Staphylococcus aureus, which inactivates a wide variety of aminoglycosides (except the gentamicin components), has been found to harbor a plasmid (RAp01) that mediates the biosynthesis of a nucleotidyltransferase. This enzyme modifies the 4'-hydroxy function of these antibiotics. The plasmid has been studied, the enzyme responsible for this resistance pattern has been isolated by affinity chromatography, and its kinetics and physicochemistry have been characterized. The target of this enzyme has also been located by demonstrating the structure of one inactivated compound, 4'-(O)-adenylyltobramycin.
