Chronic ethanol intoxication leads to the development of a resistance to lipid disordering by ethanol, a phenomenon known as "membrane tolerance". In the absence of the added ethanol, the lipid order, as measured by ESR and fluorescence techniques, does not necessarily change as a result of chronic ethanol ingestion (as in liver microsomes, for example). This suggests that the spectroscopic techniques detect tolerance somewhat indirectly, in that the modification responsible may reside in a region distinct from that being probed and also raises the question of whether membrane tolerance is necessarily associated with an alteration in the membrane lipid structure. Here we show that liver microsomes from rats treated chronically with ethanol are rendered relatively resistant to the hydrolytic action of exogenous phospholipase A2, compared to preparations from control animals. This resistance persists in reconstituted lipid vesicles prepared from extracted phospholipids. Since the same substrate (1-palmitoyl-2-N-(4-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole)amino caproylphosphatidylcholine) was used in both membranes from ethanol-treated animals and controls, the modification appears to reside in the structure and/or organization of the membrane. Further evidence that the lipid structure is modified by chronic ethanol treatment is provided by the observation that perturbance of the membrane structural integrity by increasing levels of oleic acid led to a progressive loss of the ethanol-induced relative resistance to hydrolysis by phospholipase A2. The results of this study support the idea that membrane tolerance involves a modification to lipid structure probably at the bilayer surface. The use of exogenous phospholipase A2 provides a new method for probing the structural modifications induced by chronic ethanol ingestion.
