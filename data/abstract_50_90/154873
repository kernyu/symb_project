Anionic surface active substances (SAS), such as sodium alkylsulfates, iodonate, sulfanol NP-3 used in subbacteriostatic concentrations lowered at least 100 times the intensity of the erythromycin resistance plasmid in vitro on mixed cultivation of the staphylococcal cells of the donor (strain 8325/11 de) and the recipient (strain 825-1). The cationic SAS, i. e. roc cal, chlorhexidine had no such capacity. The above anionic and cationic SAS had an antiphage effect with respect to the transducing staphylococcal bacteriophages of the serological group B (80, 85, 52A, 53). Such an effect (on the example of sodium alkylsulfates) increased with prolongation of the alkyl radical from C8 to C14. A decrease in the transduction intensity of the erythromycin resistant plasmid in staphylococci was observed in the presence of the anionic SAS either possessing (alkylsulfates, iodonate) or not (sulfonol NP-3) the antiphage activity.
