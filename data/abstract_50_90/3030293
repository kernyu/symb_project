We have placed a kanamycin resistance SalI fragment (3.65 Kb) from the drug resistance factor Rts1 into pUC19 and pBR322. These chimeric plasmids containing the kanamycin resistance fragment from Rts1 cause temperature sensitive growth in E coli. The orientation of the kanamycin resistance fragment in the vector plasmids does not influence this phenotype.
