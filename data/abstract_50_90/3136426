The comparative study of 44 isolates of Corynebacterium group D2, from urine, most frequently, shows the pathogenic role of these bacteria in urinary tract infection, with or without urinary stones. These microorganisms have an opportunistic behaviour in other non-urinary sites, and become pathogen in immunosuppressed conditions. The rapid tests as urease, glucose acidification, nitrate reductase, associated with multiple resistance to antibiotics (beta-lactams and aminosides) identify easily Corynebacterium group D2, from 48 h cultures under CO2 conditions. The results of MIC determination of 10 antibiotics, show the high activity (100% sensitivity) of vancomycin and pristinamycin, with MIC modes, respectively, 0.5 and 0.03 mg/l. These antibiotics are the most useful for the treatment of non-urinary infections. Among quinolones, the most active agents are ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin (MIC modes: 4 and 2 mg/l), so these antimicrobials could be used for the treatment of urinary tract infections caused by Corynebacterium group D2.
