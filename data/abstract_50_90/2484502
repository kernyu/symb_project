The A.A. weight present criteria of choice in order to set right a correct and effective anti-malarial prophylaxis. In the last ten years, a progressive increase of tropical diseases has been observed. This is due to the considerable growth of intercontinental traffic and of the number of persons moving to or from tropical areas where such diseases are endemic. Among these, malaria represent the most alarming problem, both because of the incidence cases and the difficulties related to the efficacy of pharmacological remedies for the chemoprophylaxis. In particular, three are now various pharmacological possibilities for malarial prophylaxis. Undoubtedly Chloroquine is the most efficacious even if there are many Plasmodium falciparum species resistant to Chloroquine and to other available medicines (multi-resistance). Most authors recommend to associate Chloroquine to others pharmacological substances to avoid pharmaco-resistance phenomena. Among the most famous pharmacological products used elsewhere are Fansidar, Maloprim, Paludrine and Lapudrine, not all are available in Italy. In China, for the therapy of resistant forms of malaria, the Qinghaosu a "schizont-killer" acting on multiresistant plasmodium falciparum has been utilizing for years. The Qinghaosu is not responsible for the crossing-reactions with other anti-malarial medicines. Various substances with Ca-antagonist action (Verapamil) are being experimented. It is supposed that Verapamil associated with Chloroquine can stop the flow of chlorine from plasmodium cells. The same mechanism is expected to be valid also for Desipramine, an experimental tricyclic anti-depressive when associated to Chloroquine. To the people moving to endemic areas, the A.A., at the end, suggest a series of practical norms to prevent infection and, therefore, the incidence of imported cases, still increasing at the moment, due to the absence of efficacious vaccine.
