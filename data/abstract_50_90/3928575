MT-141 inhibited 90% of the clinical isolates of Bacteroides fragilis at 3.13 mg/l, whereas six reference cephem antibiotics inhibited them at 12.5- greater than 100 mg/l. MT-141 was stable to the Bacteroides beta-lactamases, but the stability alone could not explain the potent activity of MT-141 against the other Bacteroides spp., which produced only small amounts of beta-lactamase, but were resistant to other cephem antibiotics. MT-141 exhibited a higher killing rate and more potent in-vivo efficacy than the reference cephem antibiotics against Bact. fragilis No. 36 combined with Escherichia coli No. 29. In conclusion, the in-vitro and in-vivo anti-bacteroides activities of MT-141 ranked first among those of the cephem antibiotics compared.
