Sixty-two strains of Escherichia coli were isolated in 58 farms from broiler chickens showing respiratory signs and lesions characteristic of avian colibacillosis. Serological examination of these strains showed that the types 078, 01 and 02 (for the somatic antigen) and K1 (for the capsular antigen) were the most frequently found. Newcastle disease virus was also isolated in two cases. All the strains of E. coli isolated were sensitive to colistin, flumequine and gentamicin. A few strains were resistant to neomycin, nalidixic acid and trimethoprim. The frequency of strains resistant to nitrofurans, sulfonamides, chloramphenicol, spectinomycin and ampicillin was intermediate. Most strains were resistant to tetracycline. Multiple resistance was common.
