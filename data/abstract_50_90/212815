The immediate and the late results are analyzed, of resumption of treatment with RMP and EMB in 50 patients with relapsing pulmonary tuberculosis that had not been treated with these drugs previously. After the first year of treatment negativation of the sputum by microscopy and culture was obtained in 45 of the patients, while 5 remained still positive. In the following two years 7 of the negative patients became positive again and finally 8 were solved completely and 4 became chronically ill. The most important of the unfavourable factors were simultaneous radiological and bacteriological relapses and chronic alcoholism. There was no primary or secondary resistance against the drugs used in the treatment. Intolerance to the drugs, although frequent, did not significantly affect the course of the treatment, especially because it occurred only at a later time.
