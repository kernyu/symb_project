Several deletion mutants of R6K have been isolated by mutagen treatment of bacterial host carrying wild type of the plasmid and search for clones that lost ampicillin or streptomycin resistance. The molecular weight of the mutants as estimated by agarose gel electrophoresis was 15 times 10(6) minus 23 times 10(6) compared to 26 times 10(6) for the parental plasmid. The mutants were characterized in respect of the level of resistance to ampicillin and frequency of conjugational transfer. Some of the mutants were found to differ in Eco RI digestion pattern from the wild type.
