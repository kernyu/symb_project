Laboratory and clinical investigations were performed in the field of pediatrics with cefadroxil dry syrup, a new semi-synthetic cephalosporin antibiotic. (1) MIC of cefadroxil was measured, to compare with that of cephalexin (CEX), on 30 strains of S. aureus, 30 strains of S. pyogenes and 26 strains of E. coli, all of which were isolated clinically in the field of pediatrics. Two strains of S. aureus showed more than 100 microgram/ml with inoculum size of 10(8) cells/ml, and remaining 28 strains were distributed between 1.56 similar to or approximately 12.5 microgram/ml, while at inoculum size of 10(6) cells/ml, each 1 strain showed 25 microgram/ml and 50 microgram/ml, and the remaining strains were distributed between 1.56 similar to or approximately 3.13 microgram/ml. All 30 strains of S. pyogenes were inhibited the growth by less than 0.2 microgram/ml with inoculum size of both 10(8) cells/ml and 10(6) cells/ml. Three strains of E. coli showed MIC of more than 100 microgram/ml with inoculum size of 10(8) cells/ml, and the remaining 23 strains were distributed between 12.5 similar to or approximately 25 microgram/ml, while with inoculum size of 10(6) cells/ml, 3 strains showed more than 100 microgram/ml, and the remaining strains were distributed between 6.25 similar to or approximately 12.5 microgram/ml. In comparison with the results of CEX, cefadroxil was nearly equal to S. aureus and E. coli, whereas it was 2 grades superior to S. pyogenes. (2) A dose of 10 mg/kg of cefadroxil dry syrup was administered before 30 minutes of breakfast in 3 cases of children, and serum level, urinary level and recovery rate in urine were investigated. Average serum level was 15.2 +/- 2.39 microgram/ml in 1/2 hour, 16.4 +/- 2.3 microgram/ml in 1 hours. 10.1 +/- 2.8 microgram/ml in 2 hours, 3.8 +/- 1.5 microgram/ml in 4 hours and 1.0 +/- 0.4 microgram/ml in 6 hours, and average T 1/2 was 1.24 +/- 0.22 hours. Average urinary level was 857 +/0 232 microgram/ml in 0 similar to or approximately 2 hours, 690 +/- 180 microgram/ml in 2 similar to or approximately 4 hours and 249 +/- 55 microgram/ml in 4 similar to or approximately 6 hours, and average recovery ratio in urine was 86.3 +/- 17.5% within 0 similar to or approximately 6 hours. (3) Cefadroxil dry syrup was administered clinically in 20 cases of acute purulent tonsillitis, 5 cases of acute bronchitis, 14 cases of acute pharyngitis, 5 cases of acute purulent cervical lymphadenitis and 2 cases of acute urinary tract infection. Clinical efficacy, bacteriological effect and its side effect were investigated in total 46 cases of bacterial infection. A dose of 21.1 similar to or approximately 57.1 mg/kg of cefadroxil was administered daily, divided into 3, after each meal for 1 similar to or approximately 10 days, total dose being 0.5 similar to or approximately 11.0 g. Efficacy rate of cefadroxil, including excellent and effective effects, was 90.0% in acute purulent tonsillitis, 60.0% in acute bronchitis, 100.0% in acute pharyngitis, 80...
