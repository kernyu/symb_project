We have determined the nucleotide sequence of gene linA in plasmid pIP855, which confers resistance to lincomycin by inactivating it in Staphylococcus haemolyticus. The gene was defined by start and stop codons and an open reading frame of 483 bp corresponding to a product with an Mr of 19020. The apparent size of the resistance-conferring protein was 21 kDa, when a minicell extract was electrophoresed in the sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. Full expression of linA was obtained both in Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis.
