This study included 107 patients who were given ofloxacin at daily doses of 400-800 mg for 10 days to 12 months for treatment of a variety of infections. 77 patients were given ofloxacin orally and 30 received it intravenously. Infections treated were bronchopneumonia (29), chronic bronchitis with acute exacerbation (15), chronic osteomyelitis with exacerbation (20), soft tissue infections (13), complicated urinary tract infections (7), chronic prostatis with exacerbation (7), malignant external otitis (4), or other infections (12). Pathogens included Pseudomonas aeruginosa (39), Acinetobacter spp. (9), various Enterobacteriaceae (30), Haemophilus influenzae (26), pneumococci (1) and Staphylococcus aureus (4). MICs of ofloxacin ranged from less than 0.06-2 mg/l. Clinically, 69% of the patients were cured, 18% improved and 13% failed to respond. Bacteriologically, pathogens were eradicated in 70%, persisted in 16% and relapsed in 14%. Resistance during therapy developed almost exclusively in P. aeruginosa strains (17.9%). The following adverse reactions were reported: gastrointestinal disturbances (6), rash plus facial oedema (1), abnormal liver function tests (5) and leukopenia (1). It is concluded that ofloxacin is suitable for treatment of a variety of infections, ranging from serious life threatening infections in ICU patients to chronic ones that require prolonged therapy.
