A review of selected clinical reports in man and experimental studies in lower animals suggests that, under certain circumstances, several commonly used antibiotics may cause cardiovascular depression, respiratory difficulties, or alter the metabolic breakdown of other drugs. These untoward responses are believed to be due to the direct effects of antibiotics on specific physiologic functions, rather than to be related to allergic reactions or cytotoxic lesions. Severe pathologic conditions, over-dosage, or concomitant exposure to other potent drugs may predispose a patient to these acute adverse effects.
