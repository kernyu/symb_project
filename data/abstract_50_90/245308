An epidemic that occurred at the Hospital Infantil de Mexico is reported. Salmonella poona (roup G) was isolated in 154 patients: 122 in stool cultures, 23 in blood cultures and 9 in meningitis; out of the latter, 6 were newborns under 2 months of age. The strain showed resistance to several antibiotics: ampicillin, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, kanamycin, tetracycline, carbenicillin, cephalosporine, streptomycin and sulfonamides. Seventy per cent of the strains were resistant to 500 mcg/ml (highest concentration used) and 65% to the same dose of chloramphenicol.
