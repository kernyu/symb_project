Types of resistance were studied in clinical material and in the environment a resuscitation ward in the period from September 1973 to February 1974. Identical strains with the same types of resistance were isolated in both groups. They were verified by qualitative and quantitative tests of sensitivity to selected antibacterial substances. A high degeee of resistance to streptomycin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline and ampicillin was found in all gram-negative bacilli. High effectivity of colimycin, gentamicin and co-trimoxazole was confirmed in vitro. The strains of Staphylococcus aureus were fully sensitive only to oxacillin, lincomycin, spiramycin, vancomycin, gentamicin and co-trimoxazole. The strains of Streptococcus faecalis were found sensitive only to ampicillin and vancomycin.
