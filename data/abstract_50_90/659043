Twenty-three patients with chromomycosis were treated with oral 5-fluorocytosine for periods ranging from 2 to 67 months. Sixteen were considered cured, after 3 consecutive monthly controls showing healing of the lesions and absence of fungi in mycologic and histopathologic examinations of biopsy specimens. Seven, in spite of initial clinical improvement, showed resistance to treatment. Associated treatment with amphotericin B, calciferol or thiabendazole failed to help patients resistant to 5-fluorocytosine. Resistance seems to occur especially in those with long-standing lesions or widespread involvement.
