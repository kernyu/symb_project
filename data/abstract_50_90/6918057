Single-dose antimicrobial therapy for uncomplicated urinary tract inductions in women has been reported and evaluated by several investigators. A review of the results of these studies suggest that amoxicillin, sulfisoxazole, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole are effective single-dose regimens in this setting. These results should not be extrapolated to other populations, such as pregnant women or children, or to other antimicrobial agents. The limited data available suggest that cephalosporins are less effective than the regimens recommended. When the infecting organism is sensitive, failure to eradicate bacteriuria with one of these single-dose regimens may be indicative of a more invasive infection, perhaps in the kidney.
