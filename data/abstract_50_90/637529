Changes in the antibioticograms after a single irradiation of dry cultures of microorganisms isolated at a pharmaceutical factory were noted in 0.5 per cent of 686 microbial strains tested. Restoration of sensitivity to one or more often several antibiotics was found in the microbes with the changed antibioticograms. After a three-fold irradiation the value increased to 9 per cent. Development of the drug resistance in the microbes neither after the single nor after the three-fold irradiation was observed.
