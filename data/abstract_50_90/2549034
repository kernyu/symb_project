Deoxycytidine kinase (dC kinase) is the rate-limiting enzyme in the anabolism of important anticancer and retroviral nucleoside derivatives. Its activity is often decreased in resistance to these drugs. To analyze the structure, function, and control of this clinically important enzyme we isolated 15 cDNA clones for human deoxycytidine kinase from lambda gt11 thymus and Molt 4 libraries. Four clones were sequenced. The largest clone is 2.9 kilobases and codes for a 626-amino acid open reading frame. The DNA and deduced amino acid sequence of the human dC kinase clones are homologous with a previously unidentified murine cDNA clone p3.4J (EMBL:MM34j) reported to be related to granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. Deoxycytidine kinase also has cysteine-rich regions that are homologous with thioredoxin, the beta subunit of prolyl 4-hydroxylase, phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C, thyroid hormone-binding protein, and protein disulfide isomerase. No differences were seen in the amount and size of deoxycytidine kinase protein and mRNA between CCRF/CEM and L1210 leukemic cell lines that express and do not express enzyme activity. Genomic restriction fragments were similar between the active and inactive CCRF/CEM cell lines. These data suggest that the cells deficient in dC kinase activity have a small defect in the structural gene.
