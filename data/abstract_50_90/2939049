Ciprofloxacin exhibited good in-vitro activity for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus with a MIC90 of 0.5 mg/l. The postantibiotic effect was 2.16 h. When ciprofloxacin was evaluated in combination studies with an aminoglycoside, none of the strains met the criterion of synergy as defined by FIC or FBC interaction indices of less than or equal to 0.25. However, killing kinetic experiments indicated that the combination of ciprofloxacin was synergistic for two of 12 strains with gentamicin and three of 12 strains with amikacin. Although the inoculum size had no effect on the rate of killing by ciprofloxacin, an increase in turbidity was noted when a high inoculum was tested. This increase in turbidity was due to the swelling of the staphylococci to several times their normal size and the formation of clusters of multicellular, incompletely divided staphylococci. If a high inoculum is used for susceptibility testing, this increase in turbidity could be misinterpreted as bacterial growth and could result in a false report of an elevated MIC.
