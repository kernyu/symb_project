Streptomycin-resistant colonies of Salmonella typhimurium appearing in platings of supX suppressors of strain leu-500 are less variegated in size than are those derived from strain leu-500 counterparts. Several of the streptomycin-resistant leu-500 clones, furthermore, yield suppressors and revertants of the leu-500 auxotrophy at unusually low rates, suggesting that they provide a genetic background inimicable to supX suppression. Two such "suppression-restrictive" leu-500 streptomycin-resistant (str) mutants, designated strains M(1) and M(4), were characterized as to their ability to receive the trp-supX-cysB linkage region by transduction. Coentry of a donor supX deletion mutation with the selected trp(+) marker was not observed even though these sites display more than 10% linkage in control experiments. This was demonstrably the result of nonviability of the combined supX mutant, M(1) or M(4) streptomycin-resistant genotype, rather than the lack of suppression of the leu-500 imparted auxotrophy. Both M(1)- and M(4)-type resistance was accompanied by pleiotropic effects resembling those caused by strB (nonribosomal)- rather than strA (ribosomal)-type resistance, but both restrictive mutants had a high upper limit of resistance corresponding to that of strA-type mutants. Transduction analyses indicated that the str character of neither the M(1) nor the M(4) strain was linked to the strA or the strB gene. These mutations define a previously undescribed locus, which we propose to designate strC, apparently related to streptomycin uptake rather than its intracellular action. Mutation at this locus is evidently incompatible with the inactivation or removal of the supX site, suggesting a functional association between products of the genes.
