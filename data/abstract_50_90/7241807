Laboratory and clinical investigations were performed on cefadroxil, and the results were obtained as follows. (1) Sensitivity distribution of cefadroxil. In S. aureus, two peaks were observed with inoculum size of 10(8)/ml: 1.56-3.13 microgram/ml and 12.5-25 microgram/ml, while with inoculum size of 10(8)/ml, the distribution was in the range of smaller than or equal to 0.1-25 microgram/ml, and the sensitivity peak was 0.78-1.56 microgram/ml. In S. pyogenes, with inoculum size of 10(8)/ml, sensitivity distribution was in the range of 0.05-1.56 microgram/ml, and the peak was 0.05 microgram/ml. On the other hand, with inoculum size of 10(6)/ml, distribution was 0.0006-1.56 microgram/ml, and the peak was 0.0006-0.012 microgram/ml, thus sensitivity of cefadroxil being 2 tubes higher. In E. coli, with inoculum size of 10(8)/ml, strains showed mostly high resistance as more than 100 microgram/ml, whereas with inoculum size of 10(6)/ml sensitivity was distributed between 3.13-50 microgram/ml, and the peak was 12.5-25 microgram/ml. (2) Absorption and excretion of cefadroxil: A dose of cefadroxil 5 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg or 20 mg/kg was administered to 9 cases of children aged from 4 years and 6 months to 11 years and 9 months, and serum levels of the drug were measured. As the results, in the group of 5 mg/kg dosing, the value was 0.94 microgram/ml at 30 minutes, 3.55 microgram/ml at 60 minutes, 7.65 microgram/ml at 2 hours, 2.55 microgram/ml at 4 hours, and 1.09 microgram/ml at 6 hours. In the group of 10 microgram/ml dosing, value of the drug was 4.18 microgram/ml at 30 minutes, 10.70 microgram/ml at 1 hour, 12.75 microgram/ml at 2 hours, 8.05 microgram/ml at 4 hours, and 2.33 microgram/ml at 6 hours. In the group of 20 mg/kg dosing, value was 9.93 microgram/ml at 30 minutes, 18.43 microgram/ml at 1 hour, 24.70 microgram/ml at 2 hours, 15.50 microgram/ml at 4 hours, and 6.45 microgram/ml at 6 hours. Dose response was observed thus distinctly among 3 groups. Recovery ratio of cefadroxil in urine was 76.14% within 6 hours. (3) Clinical trial with cefadroxil: Cefadroxil was applied clinically in 80 cases (76 patients). These included 22 cases of lacunar tonsillitis, 13 cases of pharyngitis, 24 cases of bronchitis, 6 cases of pneumonia, 8 cass of urinary tract infection, 5 cases of hemolytic streptococcal infection, 1 case of cellulitis, and 1 case of otitis media. Efficacy was obtained in 72 cases out of 80 cases ratio being thus 90%. Change of organisms was proven in 35 cases, among which disappearance and reduction of organism were observed in 32 cases (91.45). No adverse reaction was noticed throughout all cases. No abnormal value was recognized in laboratory findings.
