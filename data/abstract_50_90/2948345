Mutants, resistant to neamine and spectinomycin, have been isolated from S. typhimurium and S. dublin highly virulent strains. The neamine-resistant mutants can be divided into 3 classes in accordance with their sensitivity to streptomycin: sensitive, resistant to low and high concentrations of this antibiotic. The transduction analysis with the use of bacteriophage P 22 has revealed that the spectinomycin-resistant mutations under study are spc A mutations, while the mutations leading to resistance to neamine in class Near Strr 500 are nea B mutations. The mutation leading to resistance to spectinomycin (spc A) has been found to produce no changes in the virulence of salmonellae in the intraperitoneal infection of mice. The mutations leading to resistance to neamine and streptomycin (nea B and str A) have been found to decrease virulence.
