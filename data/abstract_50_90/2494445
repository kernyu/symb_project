The effect of hypertonic salt treatment on the repair of potentially lethal damage and potentially mutagenic damage in X-irradiated asynchronous and synchronous human diploid fibroblasts (IMR91) have been studied. Resistance to 6-thioguanine was used for the mutagenic end point. When cells in late-S-phase were treated with hypertonic salt solution immediately after X-irradiation, both cell killing and mutation induction were enhanced, as compared to X-irradiation alone. This suggests that X-irradiation of cells in late S phase induces both potentially lethal damage and potentially mutagenic damage and that both are sensitive to hypertonic salt solution. When cells were allowed 2 h for repair after exposure to X-rays, both types of damage were completely repaired. Almost the same results were obtained with asynchronous cells. These results are discussed in terms of the relationship between radiation damage leading to cell lethality and mutagenesis.
