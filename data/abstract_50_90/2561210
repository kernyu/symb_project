Tn4527 was isolated from a Salmonella typhimurium strain obtained in Brazil. Its size is 19.6 kb and it carries resistance to trimethoprim, spectinomycin, and streptomycin, as in the case of Tn7 (14 kb). A restriction analysis of the transposon shows regions of similarity to Tn7 mixed with extra DNA. The 2.6-kb and 2.2-kb HindIII fragments of Tn7, which encode transposition-related proteins, show homology to Tn4527. In contrast to Tn7, Tn4527 is flanked by direct repeats, which seem to be IS1's, as they have appropriate restriction sites and hybridize both to IS1 and to internal IS1 oligonucleotides.
