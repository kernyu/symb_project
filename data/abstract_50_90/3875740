Cefminox (CMNX, MT-141) was given intravenously to 20 children with the following acute bacterial infections; 10 cases of bronchopneumonia, 4 cases of urinary tract infection, 2 cases of staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome, each 1 case of acute pharyngitis, acute tonsillitis, purulent cervical lymphadenitis and acute tonsillitis, and pleuritis. Good clinical responses were obtained in 18 patients out of 20 patients and bacteriological effectiveness in 13 strains out of 14 strains. No side effect was observed except for 1 case with diarrhea and 1 case with slight elevation of GOT and GPT. From the above clinical results, it is apparent that CMNX is a useful antibiotic for treating pediatric patients with various kinds of bacterial infections.
