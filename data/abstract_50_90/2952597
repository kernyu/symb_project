20 patients with rosacea were treated with a 1% metronidazole cream b.i.d. for one month. Sixteen out of twenty patients improved. The skin and intestinal microflora were studied before, during and after treatment. Topical metronidazole did not cause any significant changes in the microflora. No side effects were observed.
