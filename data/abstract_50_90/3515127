The r-proteins of an edeine-resistant mutant of Saccharomyces cerevisiae were compared to those of the wild-type strain by using two different two-dimensional electrophoretic techniques: (1) the Kaltschmidt-Wittmann method and, (2) the Kaltschmidt-Wittmann system, in the first dimension and the Na Dodecyl-SO4 system in the second. With the first technique, the results indicate that the patterns of basic ribosomal proteins are similar in the two strains. However, the pattern of acidic ribosomal proteins of the mutant revealed an additional protein band with respect to the normal one. Using the other technique, the patterns of basic and acidic ribosomal proteins of the mutant demonstrated a similarity to the corresponding pattern of the wild-type strain. The data disclose that an acidic ribosomal protein of the mutant may have two forms with different electrophoretic mobilities and similar molecular weights.
