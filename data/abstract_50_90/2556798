The quinolones are a group of antimicrobial agents that act by inhibiting bacterial DNA gyrases, enzymes essential in DNA replication. Several newer quinolone agents have been introduced recently. These are broad spectrum agents which may be administered orally. In-vitro susceptibility testing of five quinolone agents namely norfloxacin, pefloxacin, enoxacin, ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin against recent clinical bacterial isolates at the General Hospital Kuala Lumpur was performed. The results confirm the broad spectrum and high activity of these agents against these isolates which included Pseudomonas aeruginosa and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. The quinolones would provide valuable alternatives in the treatment of infections caused by organisms resistant to the more commonly used antibiotics.
