The antibiotic resistance and virulence profiles of Salmonella spp. isolated from healthy (group 1) and ill (group 2) swine were compared. Parameters studied included colicin and siderophore production; mannose-sensitive hemagglutination of erythrocytes; resistance to the lethal effect of serum complement; resistance to antibiotics; and the transmissibility of these characteristics to recipient organisms. Group 1 (19 isolates) had 14 serotypes, and group 2 (20 isolates) had 2 serotypes. Isolates from group 2 were resistant to more antibiotics and had a greater ability to hemagglutinate erythrocytes and transfer R plasmids to recipient organisms, but a lesser ability to produce siderophore than group 1. All 39 isolates resisted the lethal effects of serum complement. Colicin was produced by 1 of 19 from group 1 and 0 of 20 from group 2. A donor Escherichia coli isolated from a pig with enteritis transferred R plasmids to 62% of group 1 and 0% of group 2 Salmonella spp. when they were used as recipient organisms. A transconjugant from the mating of donor E. coli to a group 1 Salmonella spp. was further able to pass an R plasmid to recipient E. coli and salmonellae. Plasmid isolation from group 1 yielded 1 of 19 strains with a 56-megadalton plasmid, while 20 of 20 strains from group 2 contained three to five plasmids from 2.4 to 60 megadaltons in size.
