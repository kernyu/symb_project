The data of the author's own studies and those from the literature concerning morphological manifestations of antimicrobial activity of cation proteins of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PNL) in phagocytosis and inflammation are summarized. A previously unknown type of secretion of PNL lysosomal proteins termed proexocytosis or pseudo-degranulation is characterized. A hypothesis on formation of nonphagocytic tissue resistance in inflammation foci is proposed. A lysosomal cation test expanding the possibilities for evaluation of the efficacy of treatment and prognosis of the course of diseases of the broncho-pulmonary system, purulent surgical diseases, infectious-inflammatory diseases of the urogenital organs, burn disease, parodontosis is proposed for the clinical practice. Ways for the development of methods for early diagnosis of hereditary lysosomal microdefects of PNL are outlined. Morphological manifestations of intracellular parasitising of microbes in macrophages are analysed. The problem of unity and interaction of granulocytic, macrophage, and lymphoid systems in hypersensitivity and inflammation is discussed.
