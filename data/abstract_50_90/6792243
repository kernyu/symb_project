Drug susceptibility studies on strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolated from widely different populations of patients and tested by two different techniques indicated that all 55 strains resistant to rifampicin were also resistant to isoniazid, while many strains resistant to isoniazid were found to be susceptible to rifampicin. This observation, which has as yet unknown laboratory and clinical significance, may be particularly useful in management of patients. Further studies are called for to establish this relation.
