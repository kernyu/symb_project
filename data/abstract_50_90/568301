Two similar calici agents, San Miguel sea lion virus (SMSV) and vesicular exanthema of swine virus (VESV) are susceptible to the virucidal activity of disinfectants of differing formulation. Ten of 12 compounds were effective against six log10 plaque forming units (PFU) of SMSV in a 2-min exposure at 4, 25 and 37 degrees C. However, only seven of these 10 SMSV-positive compounds inactivated VESV under the same conditions of temperature and time. Two compounds were not effective against SMSV in a 20-min exposure at 4 and 25 degrees C, but were effective at 37 degrees C. Two of the three compounds not effective against VESV in a 20-min exposure at 4 and 25 degrees C were also effective at 37 degrees C. The test iodophor compound inactivated SMSV completely but had only minimal inactivating activity against VESV at the three temperatures tested.
