Five nonionic detergents (Tweens 20, 40, 60, and 80, and Triton WR-1339) were tested for their ability to inactivate four Mycoplasma species which are common contaminants of animal cell cultures. Tween 20 was found to be the most effective, in that a concentration of 2.5 mg/ml completely inactivated cultures of M. hominis, M. hyorhinis, and Acholeplasma laidlawii within 1 hr and a culture of M. orale within 3 hr. The other detergents exhibited various degree of activity against the different mycoplasmas, with Triton WR-1339 being the least effective. The virucidal activity of the detergents was determined for six viruses. All four Tween compounds were highly virucidal for herpes simplex virus. Tween 20 also exhibited virucidal effects against vesicular stomatitis virus, California encephalitis virus, and Newcastle disease virus, and Tween 80 was found to be active against California encephalitis and Newcastle disease viruses. Detergent treatment procedures were effective in two instances in eliminating mycoplasma contaminants from virus preparations while the preparations retained most of the viral infectivity. The limitations of this technique for routine use are discussed.
