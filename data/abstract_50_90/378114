Characteristics of antibiotic resistance of 300 strains of Shigella flexner 2a isolated from patients within 1976--1977 in the regions where these bacteria were very rare for a long period of time were studied. It was shown that most of the isolates were resistant to chloramphenicol (88.1 per cent), tetracycline (94.8 per cent), streptomycin (89.1 per cent), polymyxin M (82.4 per cent) and others. 46.5--61.6 per cent of the isolates were resistant to neomycin antibiotics. A high level of the resistance was also noted: the bactericidal effect was registered in 52.0-74.0 per cent of the cultures at a dose of 500--1000 microgram/ml. 91.4 per cent of the strains possessed multiple dug resistance, 78.8 per cent of them being simultaneously resistant to 4--7 drugs. Transmissive R-plasmids were found in 68.8 per cent of the isolates. After exposure to acridine dyes the plasmid nature of the resistance was confirmed in 72.3 per cent of the cultures. Variability of the r-determinant sets in r-plasmids was noted. Strains (64.9 per cent) carrying r-determinants Tc, Cm, Sm and Tc, Cm were more frequent. Strains with one transmissive r-determinant were usually solitary.
