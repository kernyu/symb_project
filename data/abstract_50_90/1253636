The occurrence of drug-resistant coliform bacteria was studied in the faecal flora of 30 persons receiving for 3 weeks either trimethoprim alone, a combination of sulphamethoxazole and trimethoprim, or a combination of sulphamethoxydiazine and sulphamethoxazole. Bacterial sensitivity was tested against trimethoprim, sulphamethoxazole-trimethoprim, sulphamethoxazole, and sulphaisodimidine. After treatment with trimethoprim alone, no increase in the occurrence of strains resistant to either trimethoprim or sulphonamides was observed. After treatment with sulphamethoxazole-trimethoprim, the faecal flora contained an increased percentage of sulphonamide-resistant coliforms but significantly less than found after treatment with sulphamethoxydiazine-sulphamethoxazole. In the persons receiving the sulphonamides only, a rapid increase in sulphonamide-resistant coliforms was observed. During the whole study, only one trimethoprim-resistant coliform strain was detected.
