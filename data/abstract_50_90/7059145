Sensitivity to 12 antibiotics of Y. enterocolitica and Y. pseudotuberculosis isolated from patients with acute hepatitis in the jaundice form was studied. It was found that the representatives of Y. enterocolitica markedly differed from the strains of Y. pseudotuberculosis by their sensitivity to penicillins: the MIC for the first was greater than 1600 micrograms/ml and for the latter it was 0.1--3.2 micrograms/ml. Among the aminoglycosides gentamicin proved to be the most active against both species. Its MIC with respect to these organisms was 0.1--3.2 micrograms/ml. The other aminoglycoside antibiotics by their activity levels may be arranged as follows: tobramycin, sisomicin, kanamycin, streptomycin. The isolates showed medium sensitivity to rifampicin and levomycetin. Strain differences with respect to the antibiotic sensitivity were observed in both species. Cultures with multiple drug resistance were detected.
