Nystatin-resistant mutants of haploid and polyploid strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae were isolated by plating on gradient plates with increasing nystatin concentrations (60-3000 U/ml). Some of the mutants were defective in ergosterol biosynthesis, and produced zymosterol and cholestatetraenol-like sterols. Those mutants which do not form ergosterol produce less ethanol than the parent strains. They also had lower viability during fermentation of glucose solutions (8-13% vs. 33-47%). This became more pronounced in fermentations of higher concentrations of glucose. A nystatin-resistant but ergosterol-forming mutant had a similar fermentation capacity to the parent strain.
