Mice vaccinated with a single injection of formalin-inactivated suspensions of mouse brain tissue infected with arboviruses were markedly protected against a challenge injection administered hours later. The protection observed during the first 2 days after vaccination seemed to be nonspecific, in that it appeared not only with the homologous system but also between arboviruses of different antigenic groups; this phase may be associated with an interferon-like activity of the serum. Overlapping the nonspecific phase was one of specific protection, which seemed to be well-established in its own right by day 3 or 4 after vaccination. Serum neutralizing antibodies against the homologous viruses were detected as early as 24 h after vaccination and in almost all instances by day 3.
