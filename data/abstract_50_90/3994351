HR810 and four other new beta-lactams were tested against 419 recent clinical anaerobic bacterial isolates. HR810 was found to have an antimicrobial spectrum most similar to that of cefotaxime, inhibiting 52.6% of Bacteroides fragilis group strains and 97.2% of all other anaerobic strains at an MIC of less than or equal to 16 micrograms/ml. Cefoxitin was found to have a narrower antimicrobial spectrum against the gram-positive anaerobic bacteria (8.4 to 10.1% less) than HR810 and cefotaxime, respectively.
