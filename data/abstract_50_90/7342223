Laboratory strains of Haemonchus contortus and Ostertagia circumcincta selected for thiabendazole resistance were found to have a strong side resistance to a single dose of oxfendazole. The LD50 and LD95 in mg of drug per host liveweight were respectively 4.28 and 18.46 mg/kg for H contortus and 3.61 and 11.20 mg/kg for O circumcincta. A field strain of Trichostrongylus colubriformis that had not been selected with thiabendazole for seven years also had a strong side resistance to oxfendazole with approximately 50 per cent of its population resistant to the recommended dose rate of 5 mg/kg. Prolonged administration of oxfendazole by intraruminal controlled release capsules was found to be effective against both susceptible and resistant strains of the above parasites. The first observed effect of oxfendazole, from controlled release capsules, on resistant worms was a decrease in the percentage of eggs developing to third stage larvae. This was followed by a decrease in egg count and in worm numbers.
