Among several observations of greatly increased levels of chromosomal dihydrofolate reductase as a cause of resistance to high concentrations of the antifolate drug trimethoprim, in clinically isolated bacteria, one is described here of a strain of Escherichia coli overproducing dihydrofolate reductase several hundredfold. The chromosomally located resistance gene of this strain was isolated, inserted into a plasmid vector, and analyzed for its nucleotide sequence. The structural gene for the overproduced dihydrofolate reductase was found to be identical to that of E. coli K12, with nine exceptions, of which seven resulted in synonymous codon usage. Two transversions resulted in a substitution of Gly or Trp at amino acid position 30, and of Gln for Glu at position 154. Six of the nine base changes resulted in codons more frequently used. The Gly substitution which leads to a less commonly used codon, was thought to relate to the observed threefold increase in Ki for trimethoprim. Furthermore, a C----T transition was found in the -35 region of the promoter, increasing its homology with the E. coli consensus promoter sequence. In the ribosome-binding area of the resistant strain, finally, seven base changes were observed, two of which resulted in a five-base sequence of complementarity with the 3'-end of ribosomal 16S RNA. The distance between the -10 site of the promoter and the start codon for translation was finally increased one base pair by the insertion of an A at position +9 in the resistant strain. These genetic changes towards more efficient transcriptional and translational start sequences and towards increased mRNA expressivity are interpreted to reflect an evolutionary adaptation to the presence of antifolates.
