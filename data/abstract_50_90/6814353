We isolated 11 nonconjugative plasmids mediating resistance to aminoglycoside antibiotics, including gentamicin, from Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains. Their genetic properties were investigated in both P. aeruginosa and Escherichia coli transformants. The plasmid molecular weights ranged from 11 x 10(6) to 24 x 10(6). A low level or complete absence of gentamicin resistance was observed when these plasmids were introduced into E. coli, but gentamicin resistance was restored when the plasmids were transferred back to P. aeruginosa from E. coli. Aminoglycoside-modifying enzyme activity was detected in P. aeruginosa harboring these plasmids, but was absent or greatly reduced in E. coli strains. This lack of expression may explain the observed decrease in aminoglycoside resistance.
