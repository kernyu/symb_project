Treatment of therapy-resistant acute leukemia with 7 cytostatics (TRAMPCO) 13 adult patients with acute leukemia, primarily and secondarily resistant to other combined therapy, as well as 2 untreated patients were treated with 7 cytostatic drugs according to the so called TRAMPCO-regimen. 5 complete remissions and 5 partial remissions were obtained corresponding to a degree of response of 66%. The duration of remission was relatively short with 1 to 5 months, in one case more than 6 months. The toxicity of the combined therapy could be tolerated, the personal subjective tolerance was good. The Trampco-regiment therefore represents a realistic possibility in the treatment of acute leukemia resistant to other forms of treatment.
