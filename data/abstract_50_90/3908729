A clinical trial of ceftizoxime suppositories (CZX-S) was conducted in children whose chemotherapy was considered to be best performed in this dosage form at the physician's discretion. The subjects were 5 children with infection, consisting of 2 with pneumonia, 1 with tonsillitis, and 2 with UTI. The results were as follows. The clinical response to CZX-S was "markedly effective" in 3 and "effective" in 2, with the 100% effectiveness rate. Neither adverse drug reactions nor abnormal laboratory tests were detected. No unwanted expulsion of the suppository occurred. The serum concentration of CZX 30 minutes after the first insertion ranged from 8.38 to 11.4 micrograms/ml, and the urinary concentration of CZX in the 6-hour urine collections, from 23.6 to 290 micrograms/ml.
