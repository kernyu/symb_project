Production of beta-lactamases, and of the plasmid-encoded TEM- and SHV-type enzymes in particular, is the most common mechanism of resistance against beta-lactam antibiotics in Gram-negative bacteria. The two ubiquitous types of enzyme have a large spectrum of activity and preferentially hydrolyse the penicillins as well as some first- and second-generation cephalosporins. Recently, point mutations in the corresponding genes have been observed, apparently selected for, in the clinical setting, by originally 'beta-lactamase-stable' third-generation cephalosporins or by monobactams, which fall into the substrate range of the mutant or 'extended-spectrum' beta-lactamases. The point mutations are clustered in three areas, each adjacent to one of the seven evolutionarily conserved boxes described by Joris et al. (1988). The substituted amino acids at positions 102 (adjacent to the alpha-3 helix), 162 (adjacent to the alpha-7 helix) and 235, 236 and 237 (on the beta-3 strand) are located in close proximity to the active-site cavity and are thought to open up novel enzyme-substrate interactions, involving, in particular, the oxyimino moieties of the newer beta-lactam compounds.
