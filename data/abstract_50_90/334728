Deletions of colicin E1 (colE1) plasmid deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) carrying the TnA transposon have been isolated. All except two were generated by nuclease digestion of plasmid DNA from its EcoRI-sensitive site. A plasmid containing about 16% of the ColE1 DNA (6.5 X 10(5) daltons) was generated that also contained the part of the TnA transposon conferring ampicillin resistance. The extents of different deletions were determined by analysis of restriction endonuclease fragments generated by the restriction endonucleases HaeII, BamHI, and HincII.
