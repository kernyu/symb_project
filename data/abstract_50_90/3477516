The cat-86 gene of Bacillus pumilus, specifying a Cm-inducible CAT enzyme, was cloned previously into B. subtilis on plasmid pUB110. Various lines of evidence suggest that control of expression of this gene is at the level of translation and involves inverted complementary repeat sequences 5' to the initiation codon. A series of deletions have been generated in this region and their effects on the induction of cat-86 observed in B. subtilis, Escherichia coli and a number of ribosomal mutant strains of B. subtilis. The results indicate that the inverted complementary repeat sequences, which are capable of forming a stable stem-loop structure in the mRNA (delta G = -24.4 kcal/mol), form a barrier to translation in E. coli and B. subtilis.
