Studies in vitro among children on the response of Plasmodium falciparum to chloroquine were conducted as part of the national long-term monitoring of drug resistance in a holo- to hyperendemic malarious area of Tanzania between 1983 and 1989. Overall, no significant increase in chloroquine resistance was observed. However, in children under 5 years old resistance increased during this period, whereas in schoolchildren resistance decreased from 1986 to 1989. A hypothesis based on antigenic differences between resistant and sensitive strains is proposed to explain this age-specific pattern. If immunity develops principally against the most frequent parasite strains, then as it develops the numbers of the most frequent strains will be reduced, whilst, the rare strains may become predominant and thus be detected in the blood of immune patients. Thus, in an endemic area, the observed resistance pattern in non-immune infants will differ from that in immune schoolchildren, as was observed in the present study. These findings may have important implications for the control of malaria and the development of vaccines.
