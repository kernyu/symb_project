Thirty-eight patients with 41 serious infections due to gram-negative bacteria were treated with amikacin. Twenty of these infections involved organisms that were resistant to gentamicin. The results of therapy in 31 of the infections satisfied the criteria for bacteriologic and clinical cure. Eight patients with urinary tract infections and obstructive uropathy had a good clinical response, but routine follow-up cultures of urine at 30 days were positive. Two patients had persistent sepsis and were considered therapeutic failures. Toxicity to the eighth nerve was documented in three of 31 patients for whom routine audiometric testing was performed. These results indicate that amikacin is effective in the treatment of serious infections due to gram-negative bacilli and is particularly useful in infections involving resistant organisms.
