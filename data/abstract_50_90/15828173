Serratia marcescens strains were divided into three groups on the basis of antimicrobial sensitivity and pigment production. Group I, nonpigmented, was resistant to most antibiotics. Group II, nonpigmented, was susceptible to many antimicrobial agents, as was group III which was pigmented. Representative organisms of each group were examined for all lipid content. There were no significant differences in total lipid, phospholipid, or fatty acid esters among the three groups. Differences in susceptibility to antibiotics in Serratia do not seem to be explained on the basis of wall lipid content.
