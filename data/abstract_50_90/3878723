We retrospectively reviewed 28 cases of postoperative endophthalmitis due to coagulase-negative staphylococci. There was an average delay between surgery and the acute presentation of 7 X 2 days (SD 3 X 3). All patients were treated with intraocular antibiotics (IOAB) or therapeutic vitrectomy with IOAB. In six of the 28 cases the organisms were resistant to gentamicin as measured by the Kirby-Bauer technique; none was resistant to cephalosporins. Isolates that had been stored by lyophilisation were reconstituted and tested by serial dilution; none was resistant to gentamicin, though two were borderline. The final visual acuity was 6/18 or better in 72% of the eyes.
