More than 50% of patients with dermatitis of the lower legs have a contact allergy. In 60 of our out-patients, the most frequent allergens were found to be balsam of Peru, lanolin and terpentine, followed by benzocaine, p-phenylenediamine, neomycin, oxychinoline, and parabens. Contact sensitization should be chiefly suspected in patients showing resistance to treatment despite apparently adequate therapy, and in those complaining of intolerance to definite topical treatment. Further indices are vesiculation and oozing in the environment of the ulceration, or scattered foci of dermatitis in the face (blepharoedema) or on the hands. The importance of patch testing is emphasized. Suggestions for differential diagnosis and treatment are given.
