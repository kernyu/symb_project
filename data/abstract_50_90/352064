The authors noted a different influence upon the virulence of Sh. flexneri (determined by keratoconjunctival test) of transmission of different alleles of the strA-gene (A1, A2, A40, A60). There was revealed no correlation between the extent of the changes in virulence and the extent of capacity ot the limiting of suppression in donor strains.
