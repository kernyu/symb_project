Rapid antigen detection methods have great potential value in managing sexually transmitted gonococcal and chlamydial infections. Ideally, such tests should be rapid, technically simple, inexpensive, accurate, and applicable to all sites of infection commonly sampled (cervix, urethra, pharynx). For gonorrhea, the Gram stain fulfills these criteria in men with symptomatic urethritis, but lacks sensitivity when used at other sites or in asymptomatic patients. Antigen detection for gonorrhea would thus be of greatest value in 1) the diagnosis of gonococcal cervical infections in women with mucopurulent cervicitis or pelvic inflammatory disease, 2) the diagnosis of gonococcal proctitis in homosexual men, and 3) in situations requiring lengthy specimen transport. Because culture confirmation of Chlamydia trachomatis infections is not widely available, antigen detection tests could be of great value in management of these infections. Major uses include 1) confirming infection in women with cervicitis, endometritis, and pelvic inflammatory disease; 2) screening for asymptomatic infections in high risk groups of women; and 3) confirmation of Chlamydia trachomatis infections in infants and in adult males. The currently available methods for diagnosis of gonococcal and chlamydial infection by antigen detection are reviewed herein. Continued experience with antigen detection tests in well defined populations having high and low risk of gonococcal and chlamydial infection is needed to more fully determine how best to utilize these assays.
