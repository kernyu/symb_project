A 5400-base-pair segment of the vaccinia virus genome was sequenced and an open reading frame of 938 codons was found precisely where the DNA polymerase had been mapped by transfer of a phosphonoacetate-resistance marker. A single nucleotide substitution changing glycine at position 347 to aspartic acid accounts for the drug resistance of the mutant vaccinia virus. The 5' end of the DNA polymerase mRNA was located 80 base pairs before the methionine codon initiating the open reading frame. Correspondence between the predicted Mr 108,577 polypeptide and the 110,000 purified enzyme indicates that little or no proteolytic processing occurs. Extensive homology, extending over 435 amino acids, was found upon comparing the DNA polymerase of vaccinia virus and DNA polymerase of Epstein-Barr virus. A highly conserved sequence of 14 amino acids in the carboxyl-terminal regions of the above DNA polymerases is also present at a similar location in adenovirus DNA polymerase. This structure, which is predicted to form a turn flanked by beta-pleated sheets, may form part of an essential binding or catalytic site that accounts for its presence in DNA polymerases of poxviruses, herpesviruses, and adenoviruses.
