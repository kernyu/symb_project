We did not observe an increase in quinolone-resistant strains in recent years despite a dramatic increase in drug usage. P. aeruginosa strains should be carefully monitored in the future since a trend to increased MICs seems obvious. Epidemiologic data on resistance have to be evaluated carefully, and special interest must be focused on the breakpoint in relation to the normal distribution of MICs. Conclusions can be drawn only if the increased numbers of strains are clearly separated from the normal distribution.
