The in vitro activity of a new cephalosporin, cefmenoxime, was tested by an agar dilution procedure against 616 strains of Gram negative rods resistant to various beta-lactams and was compared with that of cefotaxime, lamoxactam, ceftazidime (and cefsulodin against P. aeruginosa). A high activity was demonstrated on many species of tested Enterobacteriaceae including E. coli, K. pneumoniae, S. marcescens, E. cloacae resistant to the first generation cephalosporins, Proteus sp., Providencia and C. freundii, with MIC geometric mean values from 0,028 to 0,33 microgram by ml. These values were nearly similar to those given by cefotaxime or lamoxactam and inferior to those given by ceftazidime. Cefmenoxime however showed a low activity (MIC geometric means from 19,5 to 25,5 micrograms by ml) against E. cloacae resistant to second generation cephalosporins (the better agent was lamoxactam), A. calcoaceticus (the better agent was ceftazidime) and carbenicillin-resistant P. aeruginosa (here ceftazidime and cefsulodin gave better performances).
