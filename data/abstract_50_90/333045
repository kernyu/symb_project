Chloroquine resistance has arisen in both human and murine forms of malaria. CR Plasmodium berghei in mice does not produce the malaria pigment which is characteristic of the CS form. Determinations of carbon monoxide production (i.e., host heme catabolism) by individual mice revealed that those infected with CS P. berghei produce only one fourth as much carbon monoxide as do CR infected mice at all levels of infection. These observations confirm the idea that malaria pigment is composed of precipitated host cell hemoglobin and suggest that drug resistance is accompanied by a basic alteration in parasite-mediated hemoglobin catabolism.
