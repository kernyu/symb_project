We first noted the appearance of thymidine-requiring, gram-negative bacilli in clinical specimens 2 years ago. Since then we have seen 10 patients colonized or infected with these organisms. These strains do not grow on Mueller-Hinton media, growth on MacConkey agar is variable, and growth in API 20E (Analytab Products) and Enterobacteriaceae-Plus Cards (AutoMicrobic system; Vitek Systems Inc.) is inadequate for reliable identifications. Thymidine-requiring organisms are routinely resistant to sulfonamides and trimethoprim. Infection or colonization is associated with previous sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim therapy in most cases. Of 10 patients, 1 had septicemia of urinary tract origin, 5 had urinary tract colonization or infection, 2 had wound colonization, and two had colonization of respiratory secretions. Thymidine-requiring, gram-negative bacilli can be pathogens and present potential problems in diagnosis, identification, and susceptibility testing.
