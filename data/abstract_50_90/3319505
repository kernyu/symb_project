Data from many studies on the antibacterial effects of cephalosporins are reviewed. Variations in reports from different workers occur because of the composition of the strains used to carry out determination of minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs). For this reason, standard MIC50/MIC90 data are used sparingly. Where data are available, the activity has been expressed as the mode activity against fully sensitive strains of a species; and the activity against resistant strains is specified, as far as the data allow, for the mechanisms of resistance exhibited.
