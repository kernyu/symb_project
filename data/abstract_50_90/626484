Periplasmic beta-lactamase of certain clinical coliforms was released, without affecting cell viability, by perturbation of the outer membrane utilizing the fatty acid-mimicking antibiotic cerulenin. Release of such compartmentalized beta-lactamase, at high population density, seems to provide an extra margin of resistance to the organisms against cephaloridine.
