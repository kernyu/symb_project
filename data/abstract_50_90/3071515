The enterotoxigenicity, klebocinogeny and susceptibility to antibiotics for 100 strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae isolated from various food samples is reported. 49% of the samples supported growth of K. pneumoniae: a high proportion of these strains were isolated from sweets and snacks (51%). Enterotoxigenicity as determined by a coagglutination test with anti-LT4 coated staphylococci was observed in 61 of 100 Klebsiella isolates. 21% of the strains were found to be klebocin producers against the K. pneumoniae WC indicator strain. A significant correlation was observed between klebocinogeny and enterotoxigenicity (p less than 0.05). Most strains (91 and 74% respectively) were inhibited by gentamicin and nalidixic acid. Most of the strains were multiply drug-resistant.
