In a prospective study 20 P. falciparum isolates imported from Africa by non-immune tourists were investigated for chloroquine sensitivity using the in vitro microtest and the results were compared with the plasma chloroquine concentration. All 6 patients taking correct chloroquine prophylaxis (chloroquine plasma levels between 0.1-0.5 nmol/ml) harboured highly resistant P. falciparum strains (schizont maturation at 3.2 and 6.4 nmol/ml blood in 3 patients each). In the 4 patients with inadequate prophylaxis (plasma levels between 0.02-0.1 nmol/ml) the degree of resistance was lower (at 1.6 and 6.4 nmol/ml blood in 2 patients each). Chloroquine-sensitive strains were found only in patients with chloroquine plasma levels below 0.02 nmol/ml and in 4 of 5 patients who did not show chloroquine in the plasma. Selection of chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum strains under short term chloroquine chemoprophylaxis appears to be highly probable.
