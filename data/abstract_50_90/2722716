The presence of Methanobrevibacter smithii altered the susceptibility of the anaerobic fungi Neocallimastix frontalis and Piromonas communis to the carboxylic ionophores monensin and lasalocid. The ionophores depressed growth (measured by chitin accretion), the uptake of glucose and the production of H2, formate and acetate by the fungi growing axenically in semi-solid medium. In the presence of M. smithii, the sensitivity of the fungi to monensin and lasalocid was decreased. For example, the uptake of glucose by N. frontalis strain RE1 in the culture was reduced to 50% of the control value by monensin at 0.5 microgram/ml. In the presence of M. smithii strain PS, approximately three times as much monensin was needed to bring about the same effect. In similar tests, the sensitivity of strain RE1 to lasalocid was decreased about nine-fold in the presence of M. smithii. The effect was not observed if the methanogens were killed by autoclaving before inoculation. It is suggested that the enhanced resistance to ionophores in the presence of M. smithii is a consequence of changes in the energy metabolism of the fungi growing in co-culture.
