Mouse interferon alpha/beta exerted a similar anti-tumor effect in DBA/2 mice injected i.p. with Friend erythroleukemia cells (FLC) either sensitive or resistant to interferon as determined by both in vitro and in vivo assays. Using this tumor system we attempted to define optimal treatment regimens for interferon administration. Interferon was most effective when injected at the site of tumor inoculation rather than at a distant site. Two factors seemed of especial importance: the amount of interferon injected and the frequency of interferon administration. Thus, for daily administration of interferon, the antitumor effect was directly related to the amount of interferon injected. For a given total dose of interferon, repeated administration of small doses of interferon was more effective than administration of a larger dose at more widely spaced intervals. The anti-tumor efficacy of interferon was independent of the number of FLC inoculated when 10(2) to 10(5) FLC were injected, but interferon treatment was less effective when 10(6) or 10(7) FLC were injected. The relevance of these results to the use of interferon in patients with cancer is discussed.
