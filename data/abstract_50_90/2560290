The paper presents data on the nature of the conjugation-like process (CLP) of genetic marker transfer on the membrane filters in group A streptococci. Studied are the CLP development depending on the duration of the donor-recipient contact and the influences of various physiological conditions on the degree of CLP manifestation and frequency. The effect of sub-inhibiting erythromycin concentrations on the frequency of the erythromycin marker transfer is first found. The original experimental evidence and literature data suggest a role played by transposing elements in CLP determination on the membrane filters in group A streptococci.
