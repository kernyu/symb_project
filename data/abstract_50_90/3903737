The sterol composition of nystatin-sensitive and nystatin-resistant strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae was being studied by gas-liquid chromatography and mass-spectroscopy. The synthesis of ergosterol is completely suppressed in polyene-resistant mutants. Three sterols derived from cholesterol were identified in the mutants: cholesta-8,24-diene-3 beta-ol, cholesta-5,7,24-triene-3 beta-ol, and cholesta-5,7,22,24-tetraene-3 beta-ol.
