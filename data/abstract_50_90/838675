Spontaneously occurring novobiocin-resistant (Nov) mutants of Bacillus licheniformis ATCC 9945, resistant to low levels of novobiocin (15 mug/ml), were isolated with a frequency of 3 in 106 organisms. Such isolates grew well, but nearly all exhibited consistent plleiotropic alterations in colonial and cell morphologies. One mutant, nov-12, grew as chains of unseparated but clearly distinct daughter cells in the absence of novobiocin in liquid culture. When novobiocin was present, nov-12 grew as very long "filaments" which were, however, septate. Septa formed in the presence of the antibiotic were normal, except that no annular clevage of the septal wall was observed. Septa were also irregularly positioned along the filament. These observations were compared with previous findings on the effects of novobiocin and novobiocin resistance described for other organisms. It was concluded that the primary action of novobiocin might differ in gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. However, when the low-level novobiocin sensitivity, normally associated with gram-positive organisms, was genetically abolished in Nov strains of B. licheniformis they became susceptible to an action of novobiocin more analogous to that found for gram-negative organisms. The morphological alterations associated with the Nov phenotype in this organism, together with observations in other organisms, indicate that novobiocin resistance might be generally useful in the search for mutants of gram-positive organisms with altered cell walls.
