An adriamycin-resistant human colonic cancer cell line was characterized. This clone exhibits the classical multidrug resistance (MDR) phenotype, being cross-resistant to hydrophobic drugs such as colchicine, and vinblastine. In contrast, this clone shows a normal response to DNA-damaging agents. The appearance of MDR in these cells was linked to a decreased accumulation of the drug [3H]colchicine as compared to the drug-sensitive cells. This MDR line expressed 80-100 fold increased levels of the specific 4.5-kb mdr mRNA, and a gene amplification. Our results indicate that MDR in human colonic cancer cells can result from increased expression of at least one member of the mdr gene family.
