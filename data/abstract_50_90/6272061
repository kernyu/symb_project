Streptococcal plasmid pGB301 is an in vivo rear ranged plasmid with interesting properties and potential for the molecular cloning of genes in streptococci. Transformation of S. sanguis (Challis) with the group B streptococcal plasmid pIP501 (29.7 kb) gave rise to the deletion derivative pGB301 (9.8 kb, copy number 10) which retained the multiple resistance phenotype of its ancestor (inducible MLS-resistance, chloramphenicol resistance). Among the eight restriction endonucleases used to physically map pGB301 were four that cleaved the plasmid at single sites yielding either sticky (HpaII, KpnI) or blunt-ends (HpaI, HaeIII/BspRI). Passenger DNA derived from larger streptococcal plasmids (pSF351C61, 69.5 kb; pIP800, 71 kb) was successfully inserted into the HpaII site and, by blunt-end cloning into the HaeIII/BspRI site. The gentamicin/kanamycin resistance gene of pIP800 was expressed by recombinant plasmids carrying the insert in either orientation. Insertion of passenger DNA into the HaeIII/BspRI site (but not the HpaII site) caused instability of adjacent pGB301 sequences which were frequently deleted, thereby removing the chloramphenicol resistance phenotype. The vector pGB301 has a remarkable capacity for passenger DNA (inserts up to 7 kb) and the property of instability and loss of a resistance phenotype following insertion of passenger DNA into the HaeIII/BspRI site should facilitate the identification of cloned segments of DNA when using this plasmid in molecular cloning experiments.
