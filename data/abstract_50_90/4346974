Susceptibility to 11 antibiotics was determined for 63 cultures of Staphylococcus aureus and 63 cultures of Staphylococcus epidermidis obtained at random from the clinical laboratory. The incidence of resistance to nine of these antibiotics was greater for S. epidermidis than for S. aureus. Studies of the minimal inhibitory concentration of these cultures to clindamycin showed that 61 cultures of S. aureus were susceptible whereas only 46 cultures of S. epidermidis were susceptible to this antibiotic. Although cultures of S. aureus were more active in the production of seven virulence factors, some cultures of S. epidermidis produced virulence factors. By successive cultivation in increasing concentrations of clindamycin, resistant variants were obtained for 10 cultures of S. aureus and 3 cultures of S. epidermidis. The presence of subinhibitory concentrations of clindamycin inhibited the production of some virulence factors by the resistant variants. In view of the greater resistance of S. epidermidis to antibiotics and its ability to produce virulence factors, its isolation in the clinical laboratory should not be regarded lightly.
