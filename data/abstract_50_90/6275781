The in vitro activity of a new beta-lactam antibiotic, cefmenoxime, was compared with those of cefotaxime, cofuroxime, cefoxitin, and penicillin against 72 beta-lactamase-negative and 26 beta-lactamase-positive Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Cefmenoxime was as active as cefotaxime and more active than the other three antimicrobial agents. It inhibited all isolates, regardless of beta-lactamase activity, at a concentration of less than or equal to 0.015 microgram/ml.
