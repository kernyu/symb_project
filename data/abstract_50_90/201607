Genes responsible for round morphology in mecillinam-resistant, round morphological mutants of Escherichia coli have been mapped. Three mutants, called rodX, mapped at around 14 min, and two, called rodY, mapped at around 70 min by P1 transduction. These are either the same or very close to the loci reported, respectively, for the rodA (H. Matsuzawa, K. Hayakawa, T. Sato, and K. Imahori, J. Bacteriol. 115:436-442, 1973) and envB genes (B. Westling-Haggstrom and S. Normark, J. Bacteriol. 123:75-82, 1975). This suggests that mecillinam can be used very efficiently to select for found morphological mutants of rodA and envB after nitrosoguanidine treatment.
