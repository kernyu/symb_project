We have isolated a pathogenic strain of LDB from the water of the hospital cooling-water storage tank for air-conditioning system. At the same time, other bacteria were also isolated with Pseudomonas and Flavobacterium being predominant, most of these organisms in the water of air-conditioning system were resistant to antibacterial drugs. A proposal to improve architectural design and to sterilize air-conditioning water was suggested.
