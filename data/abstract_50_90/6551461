The present study concern in vitro observation on the susceptibility to 20 antibacterial agents of the strains of Flavobacterium meningosepticum from clinical specimens at Juntendo University Hospital during the 1 year period of 1981. The tests for susceptibility of the 144 strains to the drugs were all performed by the serial 2-fold agar plate dilution method on Mueller Hinton agar (Difco), standardized by the Japan Society of Chemotherapy using the Microplanter apparatus with one loop of approximately 10(8) cells/ml. The antibacterial agents tested were as follows: ampicillin, sulbenicillin, piperacillin, mezlocillin, cefazolin, cefmetazole, cefoperazone, cefotaxime, ceftizoxime, kanamycin, gentamicin, tobramycin, amikacin, tetracycline, doxycycline, minocycline, nalidixic acid, pipemidic acid, erythromycin and clindamycin. 1. Thirty-seven per cent of the strains were isolated from sputum, 23% from urine (greater than or equal to 10(5) ml), and 18% from pus and exudate. Only 3 and 2 strains were isolated from cerebrospinal fluid and blood, respectively. 2. A large number of the strains tested were highly resistant to ABPC, SBPC, CEZ, KM, TOB, AMK, PPA and EM, and moderately resistant to PIPC, MZPC, CMZ, CPZ, CTX, CZX, GM, TC and NA. The most of the strains were highly sensitive to MINO, CLDM and DOXY in this order. There was no strain resistant to MINO in this study. 3. The yearly change of the antibacterial activities of DOXY, MINO, CLDM was not significant and 9% of the strains in 1981 were highly resistant to CLDM. The strains resistant to EM were more frequently seen in 1981 than in 1974--1976.
