In order to study the in vitro behavior of the drug used according to our formula cultures of Trichophyton mentagrophytes. Trichophyton rubrum, Trichophyton verrucosum, Trichophyton tonsurans, Microsporum canis, Microsporum gallinae, Microsporum audouinii, Microsporum gypseum and Epidermophyton floccosum were prepared in order to prove its efficacy. It was found no growth in cultures to which the drug was added in different concentrations thus proving its efficacy as a fungistatic element. The inocula obtained were re-cultured in the same medium having no drug and no growth was evidenced; this would suggest its efficacy as a fungicide. This efficacy was proved for the different concentrations, that is, from the minimal coinentration (0.1 ml) up to the 1 ml concentration the drug disclosed fungicide power. The untreated controls which were recultured from the original strains grew according to their common development rhythm.
