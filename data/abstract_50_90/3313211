Twelve strains of Campylobacter pyloridis isolated in the antrum and/or fundus in 8 patients were analyzed for antibiotype. The results obtained, compared with those in the literature, enabled assessment of the culture media which are the best adapted for isolation, the main criteria for identification (urease, alkaline phosphatase, nitratereductase, growth temperature), their sensitivities (beta-lactamines, tetracyclines, macrolides) or their resistance to antibiotics (colistin, vancomycin, co-trimoxazole, nalidixic acid).
