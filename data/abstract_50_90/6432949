A laboratory-grown strain of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, selected in vivo, BS4 (agar), is susceptible to complement-mediated killing by fresh human serum but is relatively resistant to killing by human phagocytes. It can be induced to serum resistance by incubation with a small molecular weight fraction of guinea pig serum. The serum-susceptible and induced-resistant forms show differences in pyocin sensitivity tests. This indicates either differences in the structure of their lipopolysaccharides or masking of some determinant(s). The pyocin sensitivity pattern of BS4 (agar) is only slightly different from that of a closely related strain, BSSH, which is more susceptible to killing by human phagocytes.
