1-N HAPA gentamicin B is a new aminoglycoside active against most Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. Among 504 clinical isolates at a concentration of 12.5 microgram/ml all Staph. aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Proteus rettgeri, Providencia and 78% of Pseudomonas, 86% of Proteus morganii were inhibited. Like other aminoglycosides, the activity was greatest at an alkaline ph and reduced by high cations concentrations. 1-N HAPA gentamicin B was equal in activity to amikacin against both gentamicin-sensitive and resistant isolates. It inhibited bacteria containing many of the aminoglycoside inactivating enzymes. When combined with carbenicillin it inhibited in a synergistic manner many Gram-negative bacteria, particularly Pseudomonas and Serratia.
