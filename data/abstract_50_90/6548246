Rifampicin, Clofazimine and D.D.S. have been tried in fifteen active untreated lepromatous cases for a period of two years. Compared to dapsone monotherapy remarkable clinical and bacteriological improvement was observed with this combined therapy with attainment of negative BI in ten cases. Use of this combination therapy is thus advocated to achieve noninfectivity in a shorter period and to prevent emergence of dapsone resistance thereby causing the path of leprosy control before it becomes unmanageable due to dapsone resistance.
