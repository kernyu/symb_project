Chronic ethanol ingestion induced a 47% increase in the specific activity of 2',3'-cyclic nucleotide 3'-phosphohydrolase (nucleoside-2':3'-cyclic-phosphate 2'-nucleotidohydrolase, EC 3.1.4.37) in whole mitochondria. Both inner and outer mitochondrial membranes showed increased (cyclic nucleotide)phosphohydrolase activity, but the inner was increased 94% compared to 67% for the outer. Techniques which disrupt membrane structure increased (cyclic nucleotide)phosphohydrolase activity. After these treatments, whole mitochondria from ethanol-treated animals still showed a 50% increase in activity. This increase may be related either to an inherent increase in the resistance of (cyclic nucleotide)phosphohydrolase to protein degradation or turnover, or to ethanol-induced membrane changes. An increase in (cyclic nucleotide)phosphohydrolase reaction medium pH was observed when freshly isolated, highly-coupled mitochondria were used. The total increase in pH was about 2-fold greater in the controls compared to the ethanol-treated mitochondria. It is suggested that the smaller initial increase in pH and the greater activity of (cyclic nucleotide)phosphohydrolase in the mitochondria from the ethanol-treated animals relate to previously observed changes in the lipid and protein composition of the mitochondrial membranes. In addition, (cyclic nucleotide)phosphohydrolase may represent an excellent marker for membrane integrity.
