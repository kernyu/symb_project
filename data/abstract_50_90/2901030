The effect of lysosomotropic agents and secretory inhibitors were compared with verapamil for their effect on the activity of doxorubicin (DOX) in multiple drug-resistant (MDR) P388 leukemia cells (P388R) and in blocking anthracycline efflux from these cells. Agents known to interact with the plasma membrane did not potentiate DOX activity in P388R cells unless these same agents were also capable of interacting with acidic compartments within the cell. The lysosomotropic detergent Triton WR-1339, for example, potentiated DOX activity in P388R cells and stimulated the net accumulation of daunorubicin (DAU) in P388R cells by inhibiting drug exodus. However, another detergent, deoxycholate, and two membrane active antibiotics, amphotericin B and filipin, had no effect on DOX activity and/or DAU efflux in P388R cells. Lysosomotropic agents such as chloroquine and secretory inhibitors such as monensin, cytochalasin B, and vinblastine all inhibited DAU efflux from P388R cells. In a MDR B16 melanoma cell line, the activity of DOX was potentiated by both verapamil and reserpine. These same two agents also inhibited melanin secretion from this same cell line. Based on these observations, we propose that secretory vesicles derived from the Golgi apparatus might be involved in the MDR phenomenon. We further suggest that drugs such as DOX might be concentrated in these acidic vesicles, where they would be released to the outside of the cell by exocytosis.
