The correlation of bacterial lipid composition with antibiotic resistance was investigated with particular emphasis on those organisms in which resistance may be related to membrane or envelope structure or function, as in resistance to tetracyclines and polymyxin. Chloroform-methanol-extractable lipids, phosphatidyl ethanolamine fractions, and both fatty acids of these lipid fractions and total fatty acids were studied by using thin-layer chromatography, gas chromatography, and infrared spectroscopy. Consistent quantitative differences were found between the fatty acid compositions of sensitive and resistant strains. Most notable was the fact that, in gram-negative organisms, resistant strains showed decreases in cyclopropane acids as compared with sensitive strains. These changes were found to be inherent in the strains and not due to growth stage or culture age. No significant qualitative differences were noted. In contrast, no such variation in fatty acid content was observed in penicillin-sensitive and resistant strains of gram-positive cocci. As significant alterations of fatty acid composition were noted in gram-negative strains resistant to antibiotics, we suggest that resistance is correlated to membrane or envelope lipid composition.
