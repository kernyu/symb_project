The R-plasmids pBF4, pBFTM10, and pBI136 encode transmissible clindamycin resistance (Ccr) in Bacteroides spp. These plasmids are distinct replicons but the regions implicated in Ccr share some homology and appear to have a transposon-like structure. To better understand the mechanism of dissemination and to locate the Ccr determinant(s), the genetic and structural properties of the Ccr regions of each plasmid were compared and contrasted. For this work a single EcoRI restriction fragment containing the Ccr region from each plasmid was cloned into pBR322 in Escherichia coli. Results of restriction mapping and heteroduplex experiments showed that the pBF4 EcoRI-D and pBFTM10 EcoRI-B fragments shared more than 90% base sequence homology but that the EcoRI-C fragment of pBI136 had diverged significantly. The pBI136 fragment also did not confer tetracycline resistance in E. coli as shown for the pBF4 EcoRI-D fragment (D.G. Guiney, P. Hasegawa, and C. E. Davis, 1984, Plasmid 11, 248-252). Heteroduplex experiments showed that the pBI136 EcoRI-C and pBF4 EcoRI-D fragments shared a 1.2-kb region of homology attributed to a directly repeated sequence which bounds the Ccr region. Southern hybridization studies indicated that an additional 0.85 kb of the pBI136 EcoRI-C fragment was homologous to the EcoRI-D fragment of pBF4. This region was characterized by its sequential restriction endonuclease sites for HindIII, AvaII, and DdeI, and it is proposed that the Ccr gene(s) resides in this area.
