The effect of tetracycline and oleandomycin on the complement titer, lysozyme content, serum bactericidal properties and presence of specific antibiotic antibodies in the blood serum was studied. The latter were shown with the Hoigne reaction under conditions of aseptic inflammation caused against the background of latent tetanus intoxication. It was shown that tetracycline and oleandomycin used in treatment of the animals with aseptic inflammation developed at the background of latent tatanus intoxication induced an increased in the complement titer, lysozyme content and bactericidal properties of the serum. Reduction of the above indices was observed by the 15th-20th day after discontinuation of the drug use. The increase in the factors of non-specific immunity under the effect of tetracycline and oleandomycin in the animals with aseptic inflammation caused against the background of latent tetanus intoxication was accompanied by appearance in the blood serum on non-specific antibodies revealed with the Hoigne reaction. Changed reactivity because of latent tetanus intoxication was accompanied by a delay in the formation of the non-specific antibodies in the blood serum. However, later the rate of their accumulation became higher and as a result the maximum titers of the antibodies were 2-3 times higher than those in the control animals.
