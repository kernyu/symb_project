MICs of 20 2-acetylpyridine thiosemicarbazones and penicillin were determined for 25 clinical isolates of beta-lactamase-positive and beta-lactamase-negative Neisseria gonorrhoeae strains. The compounds most active against the beta-lactamase-producing strains were the N4,N4-disubstituted derivatives and the thiosemicarbazone derivatives of the 2-acetylpyridines, followed by the other compounds related to the 2-acetylpyridine thiosemicarbazones.
