Pseudomonas mallei was isolated from pus samples obtained from 34 mallein-positive horses. The isolates were subjected to in vitro sensitivity test using 16 different antimicrobial discs. All isolates (34) were sensitive to sulfamethizole, gentamycin, tetracycline, sulfathiazole, kanamycin, tobramycin, streptomycin and a combination of trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole while none of them were sensitive to cephalothin, colistin, ampicillin, penicillin and nitrofurantoin. Rifapicin, chloramphenicol and carbenicillin were effective against 32, 26 and 18 isolates respectively. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of gentamycin, tetracycline, tobramycin, sulfamethizole, streptomycin, rifampicin and a combination of trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole were 0.28, 0.38, 0.67, 1.40, 3.40, 5.86 and 5.30 micrograms/ml, respectively.
