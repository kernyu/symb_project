Minimal inhibitory concentration (M.I.C.) values as determined by an agar-plate-dilution method for 60 bacterial isolates, consisting of Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus of animal origin against 20 antimicrobial drugs are presented. Of all the drugs, gentamicin had the best in vitro antibacterial activity in terms of M.I.C. when considering all the species of organisms together, while spectinomycin had the least activity.An inoculum replicator was a convenient tool in carrying out the agar-plate-dilution method.A comparison of the M.I.C. values of 42 isolates of S. typhimurium with the results obtained by low level method and the Bauer-Kir-by method showed that with few exceptions, there is a general agreement.
