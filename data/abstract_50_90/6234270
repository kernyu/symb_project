Ninety-nine patients with simple symptomatic urinary tract infections from three general practices were treated with norfloxacin 400 mg bd for 3 days and were followed up for 2 to 4 weeks. Forty of the 99 patients had bacteriuria. Bacteriological eradication of initial pathogen was achieved by 5 to 7 days in 100%. At 2 to 4 weeks three patients had become reinfected but with a different organism. Ninety per cent of patients were symptomatically cured or improved by the fifth to seventh day after therapy started. Drug related adverse experiences were seen in 9% of patients. None necessitated cessation of therapy. No significant biochemical or haematological abnormalities occurred.
