A study was made of the effect of thermal selection of parental spermatozoa on the heat resistance of the whole organism and of muscles in progeny of Rana temporaria, as well as of the organismal resistance to pesticides (0.0025 M chlorophos). The thermal selection of spermatozoa was performed by exposing their suspension to 36 degrees C for 30-40 minutes. With tadpoles, the resistance of muscles to 38 degrees C, was determined, in addition to the resistance of the organism to 34 degrees and to 0.0025 M chlorophos. The results of selection were stage--specific: at stages of growth (stages 39, 42, 50) the heat resistance of the organism was lower and that of muscles was higher than in controls. At the stage of metamorphosis proper (stage 52) the heat resistance of both the organism and muscles increased. The thermal selection of parental spermatozoa exerted no effect on the resistance of the progeny to 0.0025 M chlorophos.
