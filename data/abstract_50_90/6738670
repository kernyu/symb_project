A dematiaceous fungus, Phialophora richardsiae (Nannf.) Conant, was isolated from human bone. In culture the fungus produced no yeast forms and was less pigmented than two other P. richardsiae isolates. While growth rates were similar, colonial forms differed. Phialides were of two kinds. While both had broad bases and tapered at the tips, only one terminated with a cupulate or rarely a saucer-shaped collarette. Most phialides were hyaline with a few lightly pigmented ones in older cultures. Broth dilution susceptibility testing of the isolates against amphotericin B, miconazole, ketoconazole, clotrimazole, and 5-fluorocytosine showed the fungus was susceptible to miconazole, ketoconazole and amphotericin B at achievable serum levels and resistant to 5-fluorocytosine and clotrimazole. The other isolates were reported to differ in their resistance to miconazole and amphotericin B. Enzyme and salinity studies showed minor difference among the isolates.
