Sensitivity of 500 El Tor vibrio strains isolated from open water reservoirs was studied with respect to 14 antibiotics. Some of the strains markedly differing from the other isolates by the sensitivity levels and the set of the resistance determinants were subjected to a detailed analysis. The problem of distribution of antibiotic resistant strains of the cholera germ is discussed.
