Amantadine (greater than or equal to 100 micrograms/ml) treatment of chicken or human trachea organ cultures 6 h before infection inhibited influenza virus replication. Chicken or human leukocyte IFN evoked antiviral resistance in the cells of the homologous organ cultures only at a concentration of 100 U/ml or more. Treatment of organ cultures with combinations of the two substances resulted in an additive effect on influenza virus replication in both chicken and human tissues.
