The physical map of the streptococcal cloning vector pGB301 (9.8 kb) has been extended by localizing the cleavage sites of restriction endonucleases AvaII, AvaI, BclI, BstEII, and PvuII. The latter four enzymes cleaved pGB301 at unique sites. Insertion of chromosomal DNA from Staphylococcus aureus strain 3Ar-m- into the single BstEII site of pGB301 led to inactivation of the plasmid's chloramphenicol resistance determinant. Twelve deletion derivatives of pGB301 were isolated either by in vitro manipulation of pGB301 or as spontaneous deletion mutants following transformation of Challis by mixtures of recombinant plasmids. The overlapping deletions which spanned a continuous sequence of 7.7 kb ranged in size from 0.3 kb to 4.1 kb and allowed to localize the chloramphenicol and MLS-resistance determinants, the copy control function, and the replication region on the physical map of pGB301. Plasmid pGB301 together with its deletion mutants constitutes a valuable tool for further molecular cloning experiments in streptococci.
