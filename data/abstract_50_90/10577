Amphetamine overcomes the amnesia caused by cycloheximide (CXM) provided it is administered closely following the learning trial. In day-old chickens with one trial passive avoidance learning, there is a short-term, labile memory existing for 90 min following training under the influence of CXM. Amphetamine has been shown to keep the memory at precisely the level exhibited by the labile, cycloheximide-resistant memory trace at the time of injection. Norepinephrine, methoxamine (an alpha adrenergic stimulant) and isoprenaline (a beta adrenergic stimulant) each mimic the amphetamine effect in CXM-pretreated chickens. That the action of amphetamine could be due to its release of norepinephrine is supported by the finding that it could be blocked by both alpha adrenergic (piperoxane) and beta adrenergic antagonists (propranolol). It has been suggested that this labile memory trace depends on the functioning of a sodium pump. Norepinephrine may be modulating memory formation by an action on the sodium pump since in preliminary biochemical assays norepinephrine stimulated the sodium pump (Na+/K+ ATPase) activity in chicken forebrain total homogenate.
