Linear plasmids with inverted terminal repeats of 614 bp were obtained from Streptomyces rochei which produced lankacidin. The 5' ends were blocked by the association of a terminal protein. A DNA model of racket frame-like structure is presented implying the juxtaposition of 2 double-stranded DNAs of the same sequence through the binding of cohesive proteins which recognize and bind to the DNA. Two linear plasmids with the inverted terminal repeats of 202 and 184 bp were obtained from a yeast, Kluyveromyces lactis. A killer toxin was produced from the shorter plasmid. The protein toxin inhibited the adenylatecyclase activity of the yeast membrane.
