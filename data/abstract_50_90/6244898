The inverted repeats of Tn5, which have identical restriction endonuclease cleavage patterns, have different functional properties. They differ with respect to RNA polymerase binding, full promotion of neomycin resistance, the polypeptides coded for by the repeats and their function in the transposition process. There is a week RNA polymerase binding site present in one repeat and not in the other which seems to be important for neomycin resistance. The two inverted repeats code for polypeptides of different molecular weights, with each repeat appearing to encode two polypeptides. The polypeptides from only one of the repeats of Tn5 appear to be absolutely required for Tn5 transposition.
