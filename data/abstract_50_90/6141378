In Eastern Thailand the increasing resistance of Plasmodium falciparum to all available antimalarial drugs prompted a reassessment of chloroquine in combination with either erythromycin or tetracycline. Both combinations had produced encouraging results in vitro, in experimental animal models, or in preliminary clinical trials. In patients with uncomplicated falciparum malaria presenting with moderate parasitaemia the trial of chloroquine and tetracycline was abandoned after RIII resistance with clinical deterioration was encountered in 2 out of the first 5 patients studied. Of 16 patients treated with chloroquine+erythromycin, 11 showed resistance (RI-RIII). These regimens appear ineffective and potentially dangerous in Eastern Thailand.
