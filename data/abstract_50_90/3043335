Susceptibility to fifteen antibiotics of 64 stains of Stomatococcus mucilaginosus isolated from bronchial secretions was tested by susceptibility antibiotics diffusion and MIC method. Sixteen phenotypic profiles were determined by MIC. Some of these profiles and the spontaneous loss of resistance to erythromycin indicate plasmidic origin of this resistance.
