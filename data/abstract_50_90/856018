Several macrolide-, lincosamide-, and streptogramin B-type (MLS) antibiotics were tested as inducers of erythromycin A (EM)-resistant [(14)C]leucine incorporation. Only 14-membered-ring macrolides having a glycosidically linked 6-deoxy sugar at the C-3 position of the lactone ring and the structurally dissimilar lincosamide, celesticetin, showed inducer activity. Modifications of EM at the C-4'' position of cladinose can apparently destroy the inducer property but do not affect the inhibitory properties of the antibiotic. The findings clearly show that inducer and inhibitor activities can be dissociated and are consistent with the concept that distinct binding/receptor sites are utilized for inhibition of ribosome function and induction of resistance.
