A method for the speciation of group D streptococci is described. A major criterion for identification is the reaction of antigenic extracts against streptococcal group D antisera. In addition, a series of biochemical tests is used: bile-esculine, resistance to 6.5% sodium chloride and potassium tellurite, acid production in mannitol, sorbitol and raffinose, hydrolysis of starch and arginine, and production of dextran. A total of 184 strains was isolated from human material and identified as follows: 104 S. faecalis, 18 S. faecium, 8 S. durans, 2 S. avium, 51 s. bovis and 1 unspeciated. The sensitivity to antibiotics was studied for 141 strains: 34% were sensitive, 23% were singly resistant to tetracycline and 43% were multiply resistant (tetracycline, macrolides and related drugs, high-level resistance to aminoglycosides and to chloramphenicol).
