Sulbactam ([CP45,899] penicillanic acid sulfone) inhibits many of the beta-lactamases commonly found to be the cause of penicillin resistance. This agent was combined with either penicillin G potassium or ampicillin sodium in the treatment of 97 patients admitted with serious soft-tissue infections. Fifty-one of the infections were caused by at least one bacteria resistant to the antibiotic alone. Staphylococcus aureus was the most common pathogen (48 isolations) followed by the coliforms (30 isolations). Ninety percent of the isolates that were tested produced beta-lactamase. Susceptibility studies showed a high degree of resistance to the penicillin alone that was significantly lowered by the addition of sulbactam. The overall clinical results showed 81% of the infections to be either well controlled or cured. Three patients failed to show improvement. Thirteen patients showed transitory increases relatively safe and efficacious in the treatment of soft-tissue infection caused by penicillin-resistant and penicillin-susceptible organisms.
