The in vitro susceptibility of twenty isolates of Plasmodium falciparum from Tha Song Yang, Tak province, Thailand were determined. The isolates were resistant to chloroquine (IC50 = 220 nM; MIC = 762 nM), quinine (IC50 = 252 nM; MIC = 1010 nM), and pyrimethamine (IC50 = 16400 nM; MIC = 43100 nM) but generally sensitive to mefloquine (IC50 = 6.90 nM; MIC = 20.9 nM) and halofantrine (IC50 = 8.73 nM; MIC = 2.71 nM). Two isolates were identified which appeared resistant to mefloquine (IC50 = 23.1 nM; MIC = 56.6 nM). These isolates may represent an extension of a population of parasites from eastern Thailand.
