Recent studies in this laboratory have been directed at investigating the cellular and subcellular metabolism of RNA in leukemic cells which have been characterized with respect to their degree and type of sensitivity/resistance to specific chemotherapeutic agents. In the present report, electrophoretic patterns on several types of SDS-polyacrylamide gels are presented using total cellular RNA preparations from a subline of L1210 mouse leukemia found to be resistant to cytosine arabinoside (L1210/Ara-C). These studies have been facilitated by using a computerized-spectrophotometric system for quantitative and qualitative comparisons of these profiles. The results suggest that patterns of RNA metabolism may be a useful biochemical test in leukemia.
