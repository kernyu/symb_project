Streptococcus thermophilus may be subjected to the effects of penicillin G in contaminated milk used for yogurt production. Sensitivity of this microorganism to penicillin G has been conventionally determined by the help of penicillin G-impregnated disks placed on solid media. It was observed that the bacteriostatic penicillin G concentration was much greater in liquid media than in solid media. The conventional disk method may not be appropriate for antibiotic sensitivity determinations if the microorganisms will be used in liquid culture. A simple mathematical model simulated the growth of S. thermophilus in liquid culture. Numerical values of this model's parameters were regarded as the measure of the antibiotic effect on the culture. In penicillin G containing fresh medium, small concentrations of antibiotic decreased the specific growth rate considerably. Increasing the antibiotic concentration caused only slight additional decline. Antibiotic shock, i.e., rapidly introducing penicillin G into an actively growing antibiotic-free culture, stopped growth of the penicillin G-resistant microorganisms, and no death was observed, but a fraction of the microorganisms were killed in the wild culture. Both the wild and the resistant cultures recovered from the shock in a few hours. Addition of penicillin G-resistant microorganisms together with the antibiotic dosage into the wild culture prevented death.
