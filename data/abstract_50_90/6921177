The clinical and laboratory date on 115 pediatric patients with bacterial meningitis are presented. Sixty-one were less than 12 mo of age including 13 less than 1 mo of age. Thirty-nine children were treated prior to admission with antimicrobial agents which obscured accurate bacteriologic diagnosis in eight of them. Gram-negative enteric bacteria, mainly Escherichia coli, were recorded in 9 of 13 neonates. Hemophilus influenzae type B accounted for 56 (52%) of all isolated recorded in those greater than 2 mo of age, of which 35% were resistant to chloramphenicol. Seventy-eight patients (73%) recovered completely following 10 to 14 days of antimicrobial therapy. Fifteen patients died, most of whom were less than 1 yr of age, including five neonates. Major neurologic sequelae included subdural effusions, cerebral abscesses and recurrent convulsions. This study, which documents the infrequency of Streptococcus group B and H. influenzae as etiological agents of neonatal meningitis, indicates that treatment of this disease with ampicillin and an aminoglycoside is efficacious. Chloramphenicol may be the drug of choice in the postnatal period, since H. influenzae is partly resistant to ampicillin.
