A strain of Salmonella typhimurium appeared sequentially in three patients in a burn unit, and epidemiological study suggested the occurrence of person-to-person spread. This organism was responsible for both colonisation and invasive infection in these patients whose burn surfaces were receiving topical treatment with 0.5% silver nitrate (AgNO3) solution. The antibiotic and metal ionsusceptibility pattern of this strain of S. typhimurium was unique and disturbing: resistant to silver nitrate, mercuric chloride, ampicillin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, streptomycin, and sulphonamides. This pattern of multiple resistances could be transferred by invitro mating experiments to sensitive recipient strains of Escherichia coli and S. typhimurium. Further transfer of these resistances could be consumated between different strains of E. coli. A survey of other salmonella strains isolated from patients in this hospital without thermal burns did not reveal this pattern of resistance. Also, strains of S. typhimurium, isolated elsewhere and showing simultaneous resistance to both ampicillin and chloramphenicol, were not resistant to AgNO3 in vitro. The very real danger of this strain of S. typhimurium in burn units stems from its resistance to the two most effective antibiotics (ampicillin and chloramphenicol) available for systemic therapy; and this threat may be compounded through the selection effected by the widespread topical use of AgNO3 solutions and sulphonamide preparations on burned surfaces.
