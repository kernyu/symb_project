Routine disc diffusion susceptibility tests (Bauer-Kirby technique), employing 5% sheep blood-Mueller-Hinton agar and 10-mug gentamicin sulfate discs, disclosed that a significant number of clinical enterococcal isolates were sensitive to the antibiotic, as also revealed by the agar dilution technique. With few exceptions, the isolates proved resistant to this antibiotic when tested for susceptibility in Brain Heart Infusion and Trypticase soy broth or agar. The addition of 5% sheep blood to Trypticase soy and Brain Heart Infusion agars resulted in markedly enhanced activity of the antibiotic, indicating medium-dependent activity of gentamicin against enterococci. Human serum and urine failed to support optimal growth of enterococci. Thus, it was not possible to correlate the activity of gentamicin in any of the media examined with that in serum or urine.
