Alcohol use is associated with an increased prevalence of hypertension although the responsible mechanisms and hemodynamic correlates have not been well-defined. Disorders of electrolyte and water metabolism with resultant retention of sodium and water are common in alcoholics. However, although volume relates to cardiac output, and cardiac output to blood pressure, plasma volume expansion does not appear to be important in the development of the hypertension associated with chronic alcoholic use. Most available evidence suggests that the primary underlying mechanism is increased vascular resistance. Chronic alcohol administration may produce an increased accumulation of cytoplasmic calcium in vascular smooth muscle with vascular hyperreactivity, vasoconstriction, and increased peripheral resistance. Although precise mechanisms have not been elucidated, this may result from (1) a direct effect of alcohol on plasma membrane permeability, sodium transport, and Na+/Ca2+ exchange, and/or (2) impaired calcium transport due to a secondary abnormality such as magnesium depletion, which is present in alcoholics.
