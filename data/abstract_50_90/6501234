The protease-resistant proteins associated with the peptidoglycan (PG) of the phase I small-cell variant Coxiella burnetii were either partially released from the PG by boiling the PG-protein complex (PG-PC) in sodium dodecyl sulfate containing 2-mercaptoethanol and EDTA or totally released by 1 N NaOH hydrolysis at 23 degrees C. An 18,300-dalton protein was released from the PG-PC under reducing conditions, whereas 1 N NaOH treatment extracted PG-associated proteins without apparent dissolution of the PG. Purified PG was composed of muramic acid, glucosamine, glutamic acid, alanine, and meso-diaminopimelic acid in a molar ratio of 0.9:0.9:1.0:1.4:1.0. Lysozyme hydrolysis of cell walls, PG-PC, and purified PG caused an increase in reducing groups which correlated with roughly 60 to 100% digestion of disaccharides. There was no significant decrease in turbidity during lysozyme hydrolysis of cell walls and PG-PC; however, hydrolysis of purified PG caused about 90% decrease in turbidity. Approximately 60% of the meso-diaminopimelic acid groups of PG were not susceptible to dinitrophenylation, thus, demonstrating an apparent contribution of PG-associated proteins, rather than cross-linkage between peptides, to sacculus rigidity of cell wall and PG-PC. This association of PG and protease-resistant covalently bound proteins may be important structural and functional determiners of resistance to both environmental conditions and intracellular digestion of C. burnetii by eucaryotic cells.
