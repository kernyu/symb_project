Strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae isolated from sewage were examined for their resistance spectra and for the presence of R factors. Infectious drug resistance was demonstrated in 104 (80%) of the 130 strains tested. Resistance to chloramphenicol, kanamycin or tetracycline was usually R factor-determined. Resistance to gentamicin was not encountered in this species.
