33 patients with serious gram-negative bacillary infections were treated with cefotaxime. In patients with normal renal function the dose varied between 1.5 to 4 g/day. 17 patients had urinary tract infections, 5 respiratory tract infections, 1 combined urinary tract infection and respiratory tract infection, and 10 miscellaneous infections. 16 patients had septicemia. 25 infections were due to pathogens resistant in vitro to ampicillin, cephalothin, gentamicin and/or tobramycin. 15 infections had failed to respond to ampicillin, cefazolin, gentamicin or tobramycin therapy. 32/33 patients responded favourably to cefotaxime (cure or improvement) but 4 patients developed superinfection with cefotaxime-resistant bacteria. No evidence of nephrotoxicity was observed except for a transient moderate rise in creatinine in one patient.
