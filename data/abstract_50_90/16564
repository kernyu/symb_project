The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of penicillin and six other antimicrobials were determined for 50 clinical isolates of Bacteroides melaninogenicus. Agar dilution susceptibilities were performed using supplemented brucella blood agar and the proposed National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards standard method for anaerobes; results with the two methods were comparable. A penicillin concentration >/=0.8 mug/ml was needed to inhibit 56% of the isolates, whereas 100% were susceptible to 0.1 mug of clindamycin per ml. All isolates with penicillin MIC values >/=0.8 mug/ml produced beta-lactamase using a slide method. A micro-iodometric assay was used to quantitate beta-lactamase production in six isolates. The beta-lactamase activity of B. melaninogenicus was comparable to that of a Staphylococcus aureus isolate but was not inducible, and the specific amount produced correlated only partially with penicillin MIC values. A clinical review of patients from whom the beta-lactamase-producing strains of B. melaninogenicus were isolated did not suggest any increased virulence in these strains or an unexpectedly poor clinical response to appropriate therapy.
