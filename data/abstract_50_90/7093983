The results of this open multicenter trial with 100 patients of both sexes show that a single 300-mg dose of rosoxacin (Win 35,213) was effective in achieving a 94% cure rate, both clinical and bacteriological, on the seventh day after treatment in patients with uncomplicated acute gonococcal infection. The cure rate in men was 94% (86/92) and in women 100% (8/8). All isolates of Neisseria gonorrhoeae were susceptible to rosoxacin, as determined by 5-micrograms sensitivity disks. Adverse effects were seen in 14 patients--13 men and one woman. Twelve patients reported dizziness, one drowsiness, and one visual changes. It is concluded that rosoxacin can be of great usefulness in the epidemiological control of acute gonococcal infection, because of the lack of in vitro resistance to it, its minimal adverse effects, the low dose requirements, and the effectiveness of a single dose. The drug does not appear to have any treponemicidal action.
