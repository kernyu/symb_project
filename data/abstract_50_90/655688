Antibiotic sensitivity of 363 strains of Citrobacter and 124 strains of Hafnia isolated from patients with acute intestine infections and healthy persons was studied. It was found that 44.6 per cent of the Citrobacter isolates and 36.3 per cent of the Hafnia isolates were resistant to one or more antibiotics. Different sensitivity of the bacteria of these 2 genera of the conditionally pathogenic enterobacteria to definite antibiotics was shown. The resistant strains of Citrobacter to negramon, monomycin, levomycetin, polymyxin, streptomycin and tetracycline amounted to 3, 6.1, 24, 14.3, 24.8 and 25.9 per cent, respectively. Among the Hafnia isolates the resistant strains to negramone, levomycetin, polymyxin and tetracyline amounted to 0.8, 8.9, 29.8 and 25 per cent, respectively. All the tested strains of Hafnia were sensitive to monomycin and streptomycin. Comparison of the culture antibiotic sensitivity with respect to the resistance spectra revealed 24 and 5 types of resistance in the cultures of Citrobacter and Hafnia, respectively.
