Among spontaneous mutants of Escherichia coli selected for resistance against sulfonamides, thermosensitive strains were found. These were shown to possess a changed dihydropteroate synthase (EC 2.5.1.15), which had a substantially higher Km value for its normal substrate, p-aminobenzoic acid, and an about 150-fold higher Km for sulfonamides. The mutationally changed dihydropteroate synthase was found to be thermosensitive by in vitro assays. The thermosensitivity was used as an enzyme marker to demonstrate the complex formation between 2-amino-4-hydroxy-6-pyrophosphorylmethyl pteridine and sulfonamides by partially purified dihydropteroate synthase. The formation of folate from 2-amino-4-hydroxy-6-pyrophosphorylmethyl pteridine and p-aminobenzoylglutamic acid by dihydropteroate synthase was found to be very sensitive to inhibition by sulfonamides and very inefficient with the mutationally changed enzyme.
