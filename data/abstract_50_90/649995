Cefamandole was evaluated as the sole antimicrobial agent used to treat bacterial peritonitis in 113 patients. Dosage varied between 1 and 2 g given intravenously every 6 hr. Laparotomy for excision of infected or gangrenous tissues, closure of gastrointestinal perforations, or drainage of an established abscess was required in 99 of the cases. A good clinical response was obtained in 107 patients, or 95% of the total group. Of the six deaths only one could be attributed to infection. No evidence of renal, hepatic, or hematopoietic toxicity was noted. There were no allergic reactions, although 13 patients (12%) developed phlebitis in a vein used for antibiotic administration. Bacteriological studies revealed aerobic peritonitis in 99% of the patients, with anaerobe participation in 60% of these cases. Sensitivity testing by the disk diffusion and tube dilution methods confirmed the appropriateness of cefamandole therapy; 91% of the gram-negative rods and 61% of the anaerobes were susceptible. From results of this study, it would appear that cefamandole is a reliably effective antibiotic for use in treatment of most forms of acute peritonitis. Its role in surgical prophylaxis may be even more promising.
