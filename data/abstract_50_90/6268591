A covalently closed circular (ccc) DNA, with a weight of 44.7 x 10(6) daltons, has been isolated from Bacillus brevis ATCC 999 (a gramicidin S producer) and from the gramicidin S-negative mutant EB16. The ccc DNA in the case of the parent strain, is mainly (99%) attached to the chromosome and membrane fraction. A restriction enzyme map of the plasmid DNA was constructed for the enzymes SalI, SmaI and BamHI, which cleaved the plasmid DNA into two, two and six fragments respectively. Further digestion with the endonucleases EcoRI and HindIII cleaved the plasmid into 17 and 22 fragments.
