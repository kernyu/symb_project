The antibiotic resistant faecal flora of a domestic dog suffering from an acute enteric infection was examined. The flora exhibited overall resistance to a wide variety of antibiotics. However, following restoration of the animal to normal health, overall resistance to ampicillin (Ap), tetracycline (Tc), chloramphenicol (Cm) and streptomycin Sm was lost, although low numbers of bacteria resistant to these four antimicrobial agents could still be isolated up to one year later. A total of 11 strains were purified for further study. All 11 were positively identified as Escherichia coli and shown to be resistant to various combinations of the above antibiotics, and additionally to kanamycin (Km). Each strain harboured from one to five plasmids, although only four proved capable of transferring antibiotic resistance to Escherichia coli K-12. One of the strains was found to harbour two conjugal plasmids pNJ101 (60 Md) and pNJ102 (133 Md) which coded for resistance to Cm, Tc, Ap and Cm, Tc, Km respectively. A third plasmid pNJ103 (29 Md) remains cryptic. The possession of the two plasmids pNJ101 and pNJ102 appears to be an unstable situation as variants arose harbouring one or other of the plasmids.
