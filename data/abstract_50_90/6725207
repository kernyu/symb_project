Bacteroides ovatus IB106 contained two plasmids, pBI106 (46 kilobases) and pBI136 (82 kilobases). Transmissible clindamycin-erythromycin resistance (Ccr) was mediated by pBI136 , whose Ccr determinant was closely related to the determinant on the Bacteroides R plasmids pBF4 and pBFTM10 . Hybridization studies showed that pBI106 was not involved in Ccr transfer, but it shared extensive homology to pBF4 with the exception of the pBF4 region implicated in Ccr.
