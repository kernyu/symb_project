The gonococcus has become an extremely important organism in obstetrics and gynecology. It is associated with a wide array of clinical syndromes that frequently confront the practitioner. The diagnostic modalities available are many and are rapidly increasing. Therapy likewise is becoming complex as we learn more about the infections associated with this microbe. The basic principles of care still include a high index of suspicion of infection; clinical evaluation of the potentially infected patients; laboratory support of the clinical diagnosis; specifically directed antimicrobial therapy of adequate dosage and duration; treatment of sexual partners; and follow-up test-of-cure evaluation in all patients.
