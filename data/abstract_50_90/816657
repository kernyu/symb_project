9 cases of Pseudomonas aeruginosa endocarditis are reported and the results of this study are compared with the data of the literature. The source of infection was known in 8 patients: 7 were nosocomial infections (cardiac catheterization in 5 cases, cardiac surgery in 2 cases). The diagnosis was made in 8 patients with left-sided endocarditis. In 1 patient tricuspid endocarditis was diagnosed on postmortem examination. Carbenicillin associated with an aminoglycoside antibiotic appeared to be the most effective treatment when prescribed for several weeks. 6 of 9 patients died of uncontrolled septicemia, 3 of whom underwent surgery which was twice performed because of poor hemodynamic status. In the other 3 patients drug administration was effective at first. However, a relapse occurred in these three cases compelling another effective antibiotic therapy. Surgery was peformed in these three patients. Valve cultures were negative in two cases and positive in 1. These 3 patients survived. They are still alive after a follow-up period of 2 or 3 years.
