A study on the bioenvironmental control of malaria was launched in Bizadandi block (Mandla district, M.P.) in May 1986. Besides intervention, using environmental management methods and larvivorous fishes, weekly surveillance and chloroquine administration at 25 mg/kg body weight was practiced. Studies during 1987 revealed that a large number of P. falciparum cases did not respond to the standard anti-malarial treatment. Therefore, systematic 28 day in vivo studies were taken up on the follow-up of P. falciparum cases after administration of 3 day course of 25 mg/kg body weight as per the WHO procedure. Results revealed a high proportion of drug resistant cases belonging to RI (237), RII and RIII (182) category. In vivo studies on the sensitivity to metakelfin showed that some cases were resistant to this drug. There is an urgent need to eradicate this focus before it starts spreading to other areas.
