Non-saponifiable cell extracts of wild type and sterol mutants of N. crassa were analysed by means of gas-liquid chromatography. The wild-type contained ergosterol and episertol in a 10:1 ratio. None of the mutants was able to synthesize ergosterol. Three of the mutants carry single recessive gene mutations cauisng blocks in the terminal steps of ergosterol biosynthesis: erg-1 has an inactive delta 8 leads to delta 7 isomerase erg-2 has an inactive 24(28) hydrogenase, and erg-4 has an inactive C-24 methyl transferase. Some of the mutants accumulated novel sterols as a result of their enzyme defects. The genes erg-1 and erg-2 were mapped close to inl on the right arm of chromosome V.
