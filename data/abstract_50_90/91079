Tuberculous bacilli isolated from recently infected patients from various african countries, are resistant to the main specific antibiotics. The present study analyses these resistances which are frequent and mainly directed against INH and streptomycin. Resistance against INH is frequently associated, and is due to inadequate monitoring of the treatment. The resistance against streptomycin is probably due in part to the frequent use of streptomycin against common non-tuberculous infections. The high frequency of thiacetazone resistance is associated with the geographical distribution of M. africanum. Given the situation, it is necessary to consider discarding this drug and replacing it. Unfortunately however, the most recent antibiotics, which have not yet generated resistant strains, are often too expensive.
