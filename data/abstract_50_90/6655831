Cefpiramide (CPM, SM-1652) had broad-spectrum antibacterial activities against most of clinically isolated organisms to which are paid attention as pathogenic organism in the field of pediatrics. Antibacterial activities of CPM against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, Bordetella pertussis and Proteus mirabilis were almost the same as those of cefoperazone (CPZ). Antibacterial activities of CPM against Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae were somewhat weaker than those of CPZ, but antibacterial activity of CPM against Pseudomonas aeruginosa was rather stronger than that of CPZ and almost the same as that of cefsulodin. Antibacterial activity of CPM has a tendency to decrease in beta-lactamase (PCase type) producing S. aureus, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, H. Influenzae, etc. It is suggestive that the determination of not only the antibacterial activity of CPM against pathogenic organisms but also the beta-lactamase producing activity of them is important on the occasion of clinical use of CPM.
