The routine laboratory monitoring of methicillin-resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) at a large teaching hospital led to the detection of a new, multiply-resistant strain of MRSA, which was resistant not only to penicillin, oxacillin, methicillin, cephamandole, erythromycin, tetracycline, kanamycin and gentamicin but also to rifampicin and sulphamethoxazole-trimethoprim. The rifampicin-methicillin resistant strain of S. aureus (RMRSA) was first detected in blood cultures of babies from the newborn nursery. A bacteriological investigation of the nursery revealed the source to be a paediatric medical officer who was colonised with the resistant strain, and who at the time was receiving rifampicin for pulmonary tuberculosis. The rifampicin resistance was presumably acquired during rifampicin therapy. The outbreak in the nursery was brought to an abrupt end by treatment of the colonised medical officer with mupirocin, applied nasally twice a day for a week, and by the introduction of standard infection-control measures. Reference laboratory assistance was needed to confirm the initial assumption that the outbreak was caused by a single strain.
