The particulate fraction of disrupted Chromobacterium violaceum grown under cyanide-evolving conditions was unable to oxidize ascorbate plus N,N,N',N'-tetra-methyl-p-phenylenediamine (TMPD), but oxidized NADH and succinate by a linear respiratory pathway which was very resistant to inhibition by cyanide. When the bacteria were grown under conditions where little cyanide evolution occurred, particulate fractions developed the ability to oxidize ascorbate-TMPD by a pathway highly sensitive to cyanide inhibition; respiratory activity with NADH and succinate proceeded via both the cyanide-sensitive and-resistant pathways. Studies with respiratory inhibitors, and the cytochrome compositions of the fractions derived from cultures grown under both conditions, are presented. A soluble, carbon monoxide-binding cytochrome c was found, and this appears similar to those found recently in Beneckea natiegens, methylotrophic bacteria and the marine pseudomonad B16.
