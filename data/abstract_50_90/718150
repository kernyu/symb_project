The study of antibiotic sensitivity in staphylococci isolated from the patients in the clinic of the N. N. Burdenko Research Institute of Neurosurgery of the USSR Academy of Medical Sciences in 1977 showed that in this stationary in 1977 predominated cultures resistant to benzylpenicillin. The number of the isolates resistant to streptomycin, levomycetin and erythromycin was high. The percentage of the strains resistant to tetracycline was the least. Still up to 1973 the resistance level to tetracycline among staphylococci was high. Possibly such a dynamics of the changes in the staphylococcal sensitivity to tetracycline was relative and mainly defined by the changes in the system of the results estimation using the paper disc procedure.
