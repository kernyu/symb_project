The dnaA and dnaC genes are thought to code for two proteins required for the initiation of chromosomal deoxyribonucleic acid replication in Escherichia coli. When a strain carrying a mutation in either of these genes is shifted from a permissive to a restrictive temperature, chromosome replication ceases after a period of residual synthesis. When the strains are reincubated at the permissive temperature, replication again resumes after a short lag. This reinitiation does not require either protein synthesis (as measured by resistance to chloramphenicol) or ribonucleic acid synthesis (as measured by resistance to rifampin). Thus, if there is a requirement for the synthesis of a specific ribonucleic acid to initiate deoxyribonucleic acid replication, this ribonucleic acid can be synthesized prior to the time of initiation and is relatively stable. Furthermore, the synthesis of this hypothetical ribonucleic acid does not require either the dnaA of dnaC gene products. The buildup at the restrictive temperature of the potential to reinitiate deoxyribonucleic acid synthesis at the permissive temperature shows rather complex kinetics the buildup roughly parallels the rate of mass increase of the culture for at least the first mass doubling at the restrictive temperature. At later times there appears to be a gradual loss of initiation potential despite a continued increase in mass. Under optimal conditions the increase in initiation potential can equal, but not exceed, the increase in cell division at the restrictive temperature. These results are most easily interpreted according to models that postulate a relationship between the initiation of deoxyribonucleic acid synthesis and the processes leading to cell division.
