Introduction of valinomycin into erythrocyte incubation medium increased the cell stability to water-induced hemolysis. In these conditions the erythrocytes of spontaneously hypertensive and normotensive (control) rats release 63.2 +/- 1.5% and 80.9 +/- 1.6%, respectively, of the total hemoglobin content. Valinomycin effect is completely abolished with K+ substitution for Na+ and is independent of extracellular Ca2+ concentration. Valinomycin had no effect on human erythrocyte osmotic stability. It has been shown that valinomycin-induced kinetics of Na+ and K+ redistribution was different in human and rat erythrocytes. The distinctions are thought to be related to specific anion transport mediated by the third band protein--the main component of membrane cytoskeleton.
