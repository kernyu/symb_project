A modified transformation procedure that is effective for the introduction of plasmid deoxyribonucleic acid at high frequency into Salmonella typhimurium, as well as into Escherichia coli, is described. Transformed bacteria acquire a circular deoxyribonucleic acid species having the genetic and molecular characteristics of the transforming plasmid.
