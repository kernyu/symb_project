Apparent permeability mutations were produced in Escherichia coli K-12 by bacteriophage mu-1 mutagenesis. They are pleiotropic mutations showing sensitivity to a number of detergents and unrelated antibiotics, and presumably they affect cell wall or membrane biosynthesis. One of the mutations was genetically mapped at a site in or near the acrA and mtc loci at approximately 10.5 min on the Taylor and Trotter map (1972).
