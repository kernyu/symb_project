The susceptibility of 12 isolates of Plasmodium falciparum to chloroquine, pyrimethamine and cycloguanil was studied in vitro after adaptation of the isolates to continuous culture by a 48-hour single-step multiplication inhibition assay. All of seven isolates imported from Tanzania since 1981 proved chloroquine resistant and six of these had an IC50 above 0.64 X 10(-6)M suggesting RII-RIII resistance. All chloroquine-resistant isolates were concomitantly resistant to pyrimethamine (IC50 above 10(-6)M). All chloroquine and pyrimethamine-resistant strains had IC50 values for cycloguanil of at least 0.6 X 10(-6)M which is higher than the Malayan (Camp.) strain studied in vitro and known to be proguanil/cycloguanil-resistant in vivo. Cycloguanil is the active metabolite of proguanil, and this result makes it doubtful whether proguanil would be a more effective prophylactic than chloroquine in East Africa, and whether any advantage over chloroquine alone would be derived from a combination of the two.
