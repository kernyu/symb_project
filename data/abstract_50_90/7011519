Bacteriophage P1 transduction was used to study the incompatibility group H1 plasmid pRG1251, molecular weight 120 x 10(6), and the incompatibility group H2 plasmid pSD114, molecular weight 166 x 10(6). The order of resistance (R) determinants on pSD114 was deduced from transduction and segregation experiments to be chloramphenicol-tetracycline-kanamycin-streptomycin. Resistance to tellurium and to coliphages, which are properties also encoded by many H2 plasmids, were not transduced with the other markers. On pRG1251, the ampicillin and tetracycline resistance markers appear to be located together, as do the chloramphenicol, streptomycin, and sulfamethoxazole resistance markers. Frequently, blocks of R determinants were transposed to the P1 genome or to the Escherichia coli chromosome. P1 DNA was isolated which carried the chloramphenicol, streptomycin, and sulfamethoxazole markers from pRG1251 and had a molecular weight of 64 x 10(6). Other P1 prophages carried R determinants from pSD114 and had molecular weights of 86 x 10(6). A plasmid of molecular weight 124 x 10(6) was also isolated which contained incompatibility determinants from P1 (incompatibility group Y) and from the H2 group plasmid. The mechanism of formation of these unusual plasmid species is discussed.
