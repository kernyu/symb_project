The response to chloroquine of 49 Plasmodium falciparum isolates from the Northern dry areas of Cameroon was assessed by 7 day in-vivo assays. Twenty seven patients were treated with the standard 25 mg/kg dose, and 22 received a reduced, but frequently used, 10 mg/kg dose. The results of these in vivo assays are in agreement with in-vitro data showing a low prevalence and a low degree of chloroquine resistance. In contrast with P. falciparum isolates from Southern Cameroon, no case of RII or RIII resistance was detected in the North. Clearance of parasite was delayed in 4 of the 22 patients treated with 10 mg/kg, and for one of them parasites remained up to day 7 despite subnormal but appropriate chloroquine blood concentrations.
