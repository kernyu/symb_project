Thirty male patients with gonorrheal urethritis were treated with azthreonam at the urological ward of Tokyo Metropolitan Taito Hospital during the period from January to March, 1984, and clinically evaluated. Sixty-one strains of Neisseria gonorrhoeae isolated from the clinical specimens including those of the patients were bacteriologically studied. Of the 61 strains, 9 (15%) were PPNG strains and the other 52 strains were non-PPNG strains. MICs of PCG to the 9 PPNG strains were 3.13--50 micrograms/ml and to the 52 non-PPNG strains were 0.024--3.13 micrograms/ml. While MICs of azthreonam to the PPNG strains were 0.024--0.20 micrograms/ml and to the non-PPNG strains were 0.0122--0.78 micrograms/ml. Those patients with gonorrheal urethritis were given a single 1 g intramuscular dose of azthreonam. The following clinical findings were obtained: The clinical efficacy rate of 30 cases was 100%; excellent in 16, good in 14 cases. All 2 patients with gonorrheal urethritis caused by PPNGs were cured with the treatment. No subjective side effects were found.
