The activities of a range of antibiotics on Staphylococcus aureus organisms that survive within bovine neutrophils in vitro were studied in mice. Cloxacillin, floxacillin, and cephradine failed to kill intracellular staphylococci but increased the organisms' sensitivity to killing by lysostaphin after neutrophil disruption. Fusidate and clindamycin caused an apparent small reduction in viable intraleukocytic S aureus, whereas novobiocin did not demonstrate intracellular activity. Substantial intracellular bactericidal effects were shown in vitro by rifampin and rifamycin SV, even at concentrations in slight excess of the minimum inhibitory concentration. In a mouse model of chronic mastitis, intramammary therapy with rifampin was more effective in reducing viable S aureus in infected glands than was therapy with rifamycin SV.
