BMY-28232, an aminothiazolyl imino methoxy cephalosporin which is available as an orally absorbed acetoxyethyl ester, inhibited strains of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, hemolytic streptococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species, and many strains of Proteus and Providencia stuartii at concentrations less than 1 microgram/ml, including isolates resistant to cephalexin and cefaclor. It had activity similar to that of cefixime, but was more active against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci. BMY-28232 was a poor substrate for beta-lactamases but was destroyed by the new TEM-3 enzyme, and had less activity against Enterobacter species, Citrobacter freundii, and Proteus vulgaris isolates. Methicillin-resistant staphylococci, Pseudomonas species, enterococci, Listeria monocytogenes, Corynebacterium jeikeium, Bacteroides fragilus and some strains of Clostridium species were resistant to BMY-28232.
