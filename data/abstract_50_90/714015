A restriction endonuclease analysis of the plasmids pSC101 and pMB9 has allowed a determination of the alterations that occurred in the tetracycline resistance locus during the construction of pMB9 from pSC101. The genes for four of the polypeptides involved in tetracycline resistance have been positioned on the restriction endonuclease map of pSC101.
