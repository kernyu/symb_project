We have characterized a number of P1Cm phages which contain the resistance genes to chloramphenicol and fusidic acid as IS1-flanked Cm transposons. Restriction cleavage and electron microscopic analysis showed that these Cm transposons were carried as monomers (M) or tandem dimers (D). Lysogens of P1Cm (D) are more resistant to chloramphenicol than those of its P1Cm (M) presumably as a result of an increased gene dosage. Amplification of the Cm transposons to tandem multimers was frequently observed in P1Cm (D) lysogens grown in the presence of high concentrations of chloramphenicol or fusidic acid and was also detected in P1Cm (M) lysogens. The degree of amplification varied in different clones which suggests that cells containing spontaneously amplified Cm transposons were selected by high doses of the antibiotics. The dimeric as well as the amplified Cm transposons carried in P1Cm lysogens grown in the absence of chloramphenicol displayed considerable stability. Mechanisms for the amplification of the IS1-flanked transposons are discussed.
