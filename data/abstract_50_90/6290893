Interferons produce a variety of biological effects on cells. They induce resistance to virus proliferation, inhibit cell growth, modify cell structure and differentiation, stimulate some immune functions and inhibit others. However, the different interferon (IFN) species may vary in their mechanism of action and, hence, in their relative efficiency for inducing each of the effect. IFN-gamma (type II) appears to show stronger immunoregulatory and growth inhibitory effects than antiviral effects, but this conclusion has been challenged in other reports. The aim of the present work is to compare the action of IFN-gamma and other (type I) interferons on the induction of (2'-5') oligo(A) synthetase which is probably part of the antiviral response and the induction of the histocompatibility HLA-A,-B,-C antigens. We have shown previously that the induction of both proteins is regulated by interferons at the mRNA level, but show here that IFN-gamma from stimulated human lymphocytes and from monkey cells transfected by cloned human IFN-gamma cDNA induced the HLA-A,-B,-C and beta 2-microglobulin mRNAs or proteins at concentrations over 100 times lower than those needed to induce the (2'-5')oligo(A) synthetase and the antiviral state. This difference was not found with IFN-alpha and -beta (type I).
