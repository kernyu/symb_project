Reaction of the strains of the tularemia causative agent to erythromycin (100 gamma/ml) or oleandomycin (400 gamma/ml) is one of the taxonomic tests. The study of 82 strains of the holarctic race and 63 strains of the Central Asiatic race according to this test showed that the strains of the holarctic race were divided with respect to these macrolides into sensitive (biotype I) and resistant (biotype II). The strains of the both races were isolated at the territory of the Kazakh SSR. Such a reaction of the strains of the holarctic race is a stable feature and is not connected with virulence, the isolation source and the biochemical properties of the strains. Division of the holarctic race into the biotypes (I and II) with respect to erythromycin and oleandomycin may be of definite significance in epidemiological and epizootological examination for tularemia with a purpose of determining the source of the infection, as well as in defining the borders of the infection focus area with circulation of this or that biotype of the holarctic race of the tularemia causative agent.
