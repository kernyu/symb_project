Release rates from controlled release devices are determined by the device itself and thus are accurate, reproducible and predictable, whereas in general, prolonged or slow release systems are sensitive to environmental conditions. Diffusion and dissolution are the principal means of achieving controlled release. A diffusion system is specific for the active ingredient and release rate decreases proportionately to the square root of time because of a decreasing concentration gradient or an increasing diffusion path. In dissolution systems, the choice of matrix determines the rate of dissolution and release rates are linearly related to the area of dissolution which can be maintained constant. Consequently, this system has general application, a sharp cut-off point and can be used for more than one ingredient simulatenously. Potential disadvantages of controlled release technology centre on unacceptable tissue residues and parasite resistance to the chemicals used. Advantages include, the ability to programme the release of compounds to achieve specific effects for various periods, decreasing the frequency of dosage and increasing the choice of compounds for the control of parasitic infections. Sufficient epidemiological information should be available before controlled release technology is implemented. Existing anthelmintics and control strategies can be used to achieve an enhanced, but expected result, e.g., prolonged reduction in pasture contamination to protect both ewes and lambs. In future it should be possible to devise compounds and strategies appropriate to the unique features of controlled release technology, e.g., compounds which interrupt or inhibit the growth and development of parasites. Environmental impact should be low because of the specific effect and low dosage of the chemical used.
