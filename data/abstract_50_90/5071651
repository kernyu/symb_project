The resistance of Staphylococcus aureus to methicillin and related drugs can be reliably determined by using the Kirby-Bauer method of susceptibility testing if the incubation temperature is 35 C or below, but resistance may be missed at 37 C. The 1-mug discs of oxacillin and nafcillin or the 5-mug discs of methicillin may be used for this purpose but not the 1-mug discs of cloxacillin. The latter fail to discriminate between sensitive and resistant staphylococci by zone measurement; some resistant strains of staphylococci may show larger zones of inhibition than sensitive strains. Stability of these antibiotic-containing discs was studied under conditions of temperature and humidity variation that might be encountered in a clinical laboratory refrigerator. Oxacillin discs were the most stable and are to be preferred for susceptibility testing. Nafcillin discs were less stable, and methicillin discs lose their potency rapidly unless carefully stored in a refrigerator with a desiccant.
