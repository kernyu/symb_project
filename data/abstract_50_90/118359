Nineteen patients previously treated unsuccessfully, usually with bactericidal antibiotics, received large doses (average: 15-20 mg/kg/day) of oral doxycycline (Vibramycin) after suitable testing for resistance. The good therapeutic results -- complete cure in eleven cases, great improvement in one, doubtful response to doxycycline in four, three failures -- justifies the observation that high oral doses of doxycycline can be considered as an important addition to the possibilities for treatment of endocarditis.
