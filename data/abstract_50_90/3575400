The transport of quinine through artificial lipid membranes is significantly increased by use of alpha-methylpalmitinic acid (alpha-MPS). Using rabbits it could be shown that the alpha-MPS causes a significant increase of the mean resistance time (MRT) of quinine. Besides the alpha-MPS causes an increases Cmax and a shorter tmax of the quinine blood levels.
