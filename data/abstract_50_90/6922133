Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) colonization and infection in a rehabilitation hospital (Rancho Los Amigos Hospital [RLAH]) were studied from October 1977 to May 1980. Eighty-four episodes of MRSA colonization or infection were observed in 81 patients (attack rate, 0.44 per 100 admissions). The MRSA was considered to have been acquired at RLAH in 65% of the episodes and from transferring hospitals in 34%. The infection rate was 35% among MRSA-colonized patients, and only one death was attributed to MRSA infection. Colonization for more than 100 days occurred most frequently in wounds and anterior nares. All but two of the MRSA isolates were resistant to aminoglycosides, and 80% of those typed belonged to phage type 83A. The patients were allowed to continue participation in rehabilitation programs. Spread of the MRSA occurred in wards where intensive medical and nursing care was being practiced. There was no evidence of MRSA spread in the services with less intense medical and nursing care and where physical and occupational therapy was continued. Patients in a rehabilitation hospital with MRSA colonization may receive intensive physical and occupational therapy as long as special precautions are observed to prevent MRSA spread.
