The morphological, cultural, biochemical, serological and pathogenic properties of two bacterial strains of the group designated ;Br. suis biotype 5' were examined. Both strains were found to be atypical of the genus Brucella in many of these characteristics. No serological relationship to known brucella strains could be detected. On the basis of the evidence obtained the two strains examined were classified as Moraxella duplex and the status of ;Br. suis biotype 5' questioned.
