The transposon Tn10, coding for resistance to tetracycline, was inserted close to the tyrR+ gene at min 28 on the Escherichia coli chromosome. The homology between this transposon and a lambda (Tn10) phage was employed to direct integration of lambda close to tyrR+ with subsequent isolation of a lambda (Tn10) tyrR+ transducing phage. Results of restriction endonuclease analysis of the transducing phage are presented.
