N-Methyl-N-nitrosourea was used to induce auxotrophic, scotochromogenic and isonicotinic acid hydrazide resistant mutants in Mycobacterium phlei and its effect was compared with that of nitrosoguanidine. Seventeen auxotrophic mutants requiring amino acids or vitamins and 52 scotochromogenic mutants with orange colonies were induced. The frequency of isonicotinic acid hydrazide-resistant mutants increased by two orders of magnitude.
