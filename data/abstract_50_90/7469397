Mice were infected wtih a mixed culture of pathogenic Staphylococcus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The doses of sodium nucleinate were titrated. When used for prophylactic and treatment-prophylactic purposes, these doses did not change the antiinfection resistance of the animals. The doses of tetracycline and lincomycin combination (lincotetrin) having no therapeutic effect on repeated use of the combination were also chosen. It was shown that the combined use of the antibiotics and sodium nucleinate in the above doses promoted a significant increase in the animal survival rate while the drugs used alone did not promote any increase in the survival of the mice. The decrease in the death rate of the animals was observed both with the parenteral and the oral use of sodium nucleinate.
