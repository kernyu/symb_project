Two transposable elements, Tn2410 and Tn2411, were isolated from Salmonella typhimurium R-factor R1767. They have sizes of 18.5 and 18.0 kilobases, respectively. Tn2411 mediates resistance to streptomycin, sulfonamides, and mercury. In Tn2410, the streptomycin resistance gene was replaced by a gene coding for the production of the beta-lactamase OXA-2, which is responsible for ampicillin resistance. Physical and functional maps of both transposons were compared with those of Tn21, Tn4, and Tn2603. From these data it appeared that Tn21 could be an ancestral transposon from which Tn2411, Tn2410, Tn2603, and Tn4 were evolved by the addition or deletion of small DNA segments.
