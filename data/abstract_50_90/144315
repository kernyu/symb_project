Since the appearance of totally resistant, penicillinase producing gonococci, penicillin should no longer be considered first choice in the treatment of acute gonorrhea. In order to limit further extension of resistant strains, thiamphenicol (Urfamycin 2,5 p.o. or 0,75 i.m.) or spectinomycin (Trobicin 2,0 i.m.) are suggested as replacements for penicillin.
