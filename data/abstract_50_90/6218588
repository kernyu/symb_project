Moxalactam and the third-generation cephalosporins are ineffective against enterococci in vitro. Therefore, the case reports of 2,107 patients treated with moxalactam for a variety of infections were reviewed for determination of the incidence of superinfection with enterococci. This complication occurred in 2.1% of the cases, most frequently in patients with urinary tract infections and urinary catheters. Seven patients developed enterococcal bacteremia during moxalactam therapy. It was not demonstrated that the presence of enterococci in initial cultures was associated with adverse therapeutic results in patients with skin, soft tissue, intraabdominal, and gynecologic infections.
