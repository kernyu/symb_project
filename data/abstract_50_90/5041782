Mice (BDF(1)) inoculated with L1210 leukemia survive for a statistically significantly longer span when four courses of arabinosyl cytosine are administered at 4-day intervals-not in courses consisting of eight equal doses at 3-hour intervals, but in sinusoidally increasing and decreasing 24-hour courses, the largest amount being given at previously mapped circadian and circannual times of peak host resistance to the drug. This finding relates to the many therapeutic situations involving rhythmic, and thus predictable, cycles in the host's tolerance of undesired effects from the agent used.
