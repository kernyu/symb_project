New methods of sterilization employing a chemical with moderate heat and ultrasonic energy have been devised. Inactivation of high-density bacterial spore suspensions is achieved by treatment with low concentration aqueous acid glutaraldehyde solutions at temperatures above or about 54 C. Low (20 kHz) or high (250 kHz) frequency ultrasonic energy is synergistic with glutaraldehyde. Rapid inactivation may also be achieved by using ultrasonic energy and aqueous alkalinized glutaraldehyde solutions at low (25 C) or moderate (55 C) temperatures. If compared to present room temperature techniques, "surface sterilization" time for contaminated objects can be reduced from hours to minutes.
