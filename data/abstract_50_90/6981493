N-Formimidoyl thienamycin (MK0787) was found to be active against 21 gram-negative isolates, selected for their beta-lactamase production. None of the crude beta-lactamases could hydrolyze MK0787 or cefoxitin, in contrast to cefotaxime which was moderately attacked by a number of enzymes. MK0787 behaved as a moderate inhibitor of most beta-lactamases, whereas cefoxitin and cefotaxime were strong inhibitors of cephalosporinases but not of broad-spectrum enzymes. The new compound had good penetration characteristics in a strain of Enterobacter cloacae, in contrast to cefoxitin. Against a number of trained cefamandole- and cefoxitin-resistant variants, MK0787 was clearly the most active of the compounds tested.
