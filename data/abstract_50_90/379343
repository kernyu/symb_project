The effects of divalent cation ionophores, A23187 and X-537A, on the electrical membrane properties were investigated by using the soma membrane of the X-organ of the crayfish. They reduced the amplitude and maximum rate of rise of Ca-action potential in lower concentration. As the concentration increased, a reduction of membrane resistance and hyperpolarization occurred simultaneously. Further increase resulted in membrane depolarization with a further decrease in resistance. The threshold concentration of X537A was 100 times higher than that of A23187. These effects were reversible only when the application period was relatively short, while a longer application resulted in an incomplete reversibility or in no reversibility at all. The ionophore effect was facilitated in high Ca medium and diminished in low Ca medium. In Sr medium, the same effects on the resistance and the membrane potential were barely observable. TEA reduced the effects of A23187 but did not completely inhibit the effects. The Na-cation potential was also reduced by the higher concentration of the ionophore. From these results it is concluded that the divalent cation ionophores. A23187 and X537A, carry divalent cations, Ca ions in a physiological medium, into the neuron soma through the membrane and the consequent increase of the intracellular divalent cations induces K conductance increase and that higher concentration of the ionophore induces the increase in the conductance of the other ion species, such as Na.
