One hundred and fifty-three isolates of coagulase-negative staphylococci obtained from human skin failed to transfer resistance to either cadmium ions (46 isolates), trimethoprim (37 isolates), erythromycin (25 isolates) or tetracycline (45 isolates) to Staphylococcus aureus strain 1030 or to each of 10 of its lysogenic derivatives in mixed cultures. Thirty-three trimethoprim-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococcal isolates obtained from the human intestine also failed to transfer this resistance to the recipients in mixed cultures.
