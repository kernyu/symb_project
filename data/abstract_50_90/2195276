The authors compare the respective therapeutic efficiency of chloroquine and amodiaquine in the treatment of Plasmodium falciparum malaria fever in urban dispensaries. Chloroquine has a constant rate of efficiency, whatever dosage and duration of treatment be and should be saved for home presumptive treatment of malaria fever. Amodiaquine at a dose of 35 mg/kg in 3 days leads to a noticeable clinical success (96.5 p.c.). It should be selected as drug of first to treat any malaria fever case biologically confirmed, in urban dispensaries.
