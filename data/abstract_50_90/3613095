Cefuzoname (CZON) was administered to 50 pediatric patients with infections, and the efficacy was investigated in 49 patients. The efficacy rate was 83.7% and the drug was evaluated to be highly effective for diseases in the pediatric field. The activity of CZON was especially good against Staphylococcus aureus, and the efficacy rate for 13 clinical isolates was 69.2%, which was comparable to that of cefotiam or cefazolin. CZON appeared to be useable alone in Gram-positive infections. It might be very powerful in the control of infections in secondary immunodeficiency.
