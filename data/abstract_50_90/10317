Fifty-eight human isolates of Bacteroides melaninogenicus, 42 from a variety of clinical infections and the rest from normal flora, were studied for pigment production and ultraviolet light fluorescence and by forty biochemical and other tests, including end-product analysis by gas-liquid chromatography. In a number of instances, tests were repeated several times and the results were reproducible. Agar plate dilution susceptibility tests were also performed to 12 antimicrobial agents. These 58 strains could be reliably placed into three groups, corresponding to the three subspecies described, based on seven characteristics. These included acid production in peptone-yeast-glucose medium, production of n-butyric acid from peptone-yeast-glucose medium, esculin hydrolysis, starch hydrolysis, indole production, effect on milk, and lipase production. Production of hydrogen gas in peptone-yeast-fructose medium may be another distinguishing characteristic. In general there was not much difference in the susceptibility of the three groups to the various antimicrobial agents tested. Two strains had a minimal inhibitory concentration of penicillin G of 16 and 32 U/ml, respectively. Three strains did not produce a black pigment in spite of prolonged incubation on blood-containing media.
