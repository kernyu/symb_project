The authors report the antibiotic susceptibility and serotyping identification of 1 123 Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains isolated during one year (1972-1973) in the Besancon C.H.U. Eighty per cent of strains are sensitive to 3.2 mcg/ml of Gentamycin (G); to 6.4 mcg/ml of Colistin (Co); to 25 mcg/ml of Rifampicin (R) and 400 mcg/ml of Carbenicillin (Ca). Tobramycin (T) and Lividomycin (L) are active on G-resistant strains in the ratio: CMI.T/CMI.G = 0.12 and CMI.L/CMI.G = 0.25. Among the serotypes, the most common are the 3 (19% of the total), 6 (18.2%) and 5 (11.9%). The serotype 11 (9.5% of the total) is the most resistant to Carbenicillin (CMI m = 400-800 mcg/ml), to Gentamicin (CMI m = 4 mcg/ml) and to Colistin (CMI m = 6.4 to 12.5 mcg/ml). Urinary tract bacteria are more resistant (CMI.Ca 400 mcg/ml; CMI.G = 3.2-6.4 MCG/ML; CMI.R = 25-50 mcg/ml) than fecal bacteria (CMI.Ca 100-200 mcg/ml; CMI.G 1.6 mcg/ml; CMI.R 12.5-25 mcg/ml). This resistance seems essentially linked to bacterial localization, not to serotype: indeed it is possible to find in the same patient, several resistant serotypes in the urinary tract, although bacteria in other sites remain sensitive.
