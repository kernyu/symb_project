We have isolated a circular form of Tn2350, an IS1-flanked kanamycin resistance transposon forming part of the plasmid R1drd-19. This circle (pTn2350::9.6 kilobases) contains a single IS1 element and probably arises by recombination between the two directly repeated Is1 sequences of Tn2350. It can be used to transform Escherichia coli to kanamycin resistance. It is capable of autonomous replication but is not maintained stably in dividing cells and segregates under nonselective conditions. Cloning of a segment of pTn2350 on a conditional plasmid vector allowed us to assign the replication functions of this plasmid to a 1.6-kilobase restriction fragment. The plasmid R1drd-19 can thus be considered as a cointegrate between two replicons separated by IS1 sequences.
