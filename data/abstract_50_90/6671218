Chinese hamster V79 cell mutants resistant to compactin (ML236B) were isolated. A resistant clone, MF-2, grown in the presence of 2 micrograms/ml of ML236B for 1 week showed a 30-fold increase in 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-Co A) reductase activity compared to MF-2 grown in the absence of ML236B, and cells grown for 4 weeks showed a 53-fold increase. Apparent ultrastructural changes in thin sections of the MF-2 cells were observed after growth in ML236B: dilated cisternae in the rough endoplasmic reticulum had or did not have flocculated contents; there was significant distension of perinuclear space; and vesicular inclusion bodies were present in nuclei.
