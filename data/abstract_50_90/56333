Of approximately 10,000 independent phage Mu-1 lysogens, 3 had a mutator phenotype. One (mutation designated mut-49) resembled mutT1 in the frequency and types of mutations induced. mut-49 was mapped between leu and ace and was not separable from the Mu prophage. mut-49 was recessive and did not complement mutT1. mut-49, like mutT1, did not increase the reversion of the frameshift mutation lac Z (ICR48). mut-49 and mutT1 induced the same two classes of trpA78 revertants, indicating that mut-49 induced adenine-thymine leads to cytosine-guanine transversions. The results support previous work indicating that the mutational specificity of mutT is gene and not allele specific.
