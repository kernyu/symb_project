The synthesis, antibacterial activity and oral absorption of the 7 beta-[(Z)-2-aryl-2-hydroxyiminoacetamido]-3-vinylcephalosporins (Ia--e) are described. All of these compounds exhibited excellent activity against Staphylococcus aureus. Against Gram-negative bacteria FK482 exhibited more excellent activity than the other compounds (Ia--e). These compounds except Ie showed good oral absorption. The relationship between the oral absorption rates and the lipophilicity of these cephalosporins is discussed.
