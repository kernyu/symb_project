DNA of the broad host-range plasmid R1162 contains a 1700 base-pair segment essential for plasmid maintenance. This region, RepI, consists of two cotranscribed genes encoding polypeptides with molecular weights of 29,000 and 31,000. Fusion of RepI to the strong tac promoter results in greatly increased amounts of at least one of these polypeptides. In trans, this construction has two other properties: it can raise the copy number of R1162, and it can protect this plasmid from loss due to incompatibility. Both effects require intact RepI genes. These properties of the RepI region, along with those of an origin-linked region described earlier, are discussed with respect to current models for control of plasmid copy number.
