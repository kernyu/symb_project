A study was carried out to assess the efficacy of a modified 7 day course of quinine in children with falciparum malaria, in comparison with those of a 7 day course of quinine at standard dosage and a combination of a 7 day course of quinine and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine, and in relation to the MIC, and to the serum levels of quinine during the course of treatment. Seventy seven children aged 2 years to 12 years with falciparum malaria were randomly treated with one of the 3 regimens. Group I, quinine 10 mg base per kg body wt. 8 hourly for 7 days, 21 of 28 cases (75%) were cured, while 6 cases (21%) showed RI and 1 case (4%) RII failure. Group II, quinine 10 mg base per kg body wt. 8 hourly for the first 4 days then 15 mg base per kg body wt. 8 hourly for the next 3 days, 20 of 23 cases (87%) were cured, while 3 cases (13%) showed RI failure. Group III, quinine 10 mg base per kg body wt. 8 hourly for 7 days and then sulfadoxine 30 mg per kg body wt. and pyrimethamine 1.5 mg per kg body wt., 16 of 26 cases (62%) were cured and 10 cases (38%) showed RI failure. The cure rates in the 3 groups were not statistically different. The three groups had similar serum quinine concentration profiles. Treatment with quinine was successful in cases in which serum quinine levels could be maintained above MIC for 7 days. There was no additional effect of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine on quinine.
