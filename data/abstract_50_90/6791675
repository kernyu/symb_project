The in vitro chemosensitivity of primary monolayer cultures of human ovarian tumours to a wide range of chemotherapeutic agents has been determined using 3H-leucine incorporation as an index of cytotoxicity. Of 67 specimens received, 35 have been successfully cultured and tested for chemosensitivity. Drugs tested included alkylating agents, antibiotics, antimitotics, antimetabolites and progestogens. The overall incidence of efficacy of the drugs corresponded with the incidence which might be expected from data on the clinical response rates produced by the various drugs. Cultures from the tumour cells of treated patients generally showed greater resistance than tumours of untreated patients. Correlation between in vitro results and in vivo response was positive in all 8 patients receiving first-line chemotherapy and in 57% (4/7) patients receiving second-line chemotherapy.
