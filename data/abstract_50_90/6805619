A survey of antibiotic resistance in Haemophilus influenzae was carried out in the United Kingdom with 25 laboratories participating. The incidence of resistance in the 1841 strains examined was: tetracycline 3.1%, ampicillin 6.2%, chloramphenicol 1.03%, trimethoprim 1.4%, and sulphamethoxazole 1.5%. Of the 115 strains resistant to ampicillin, 106 produced beta-lactamase. Seventy-nine strains were capsulate, none of which was chloramphenicol resistant, but nine produced beta-lactamase (11.4%). Comparison of these figures of antibiotic resistance with those from a similar survey performed in 1977 showed a significant increase in resistance of H influenzae to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, and trimethoprim.
