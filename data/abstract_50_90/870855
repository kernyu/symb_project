With a view to examining the importance of healthy carriers in the diffusion of salmonellas, 1257 faeces cultures were examined in a homogeneous population sample, well distributed in the area and considered healthy. The research was carried out between 5th March and 16th June 1975. 5 pathogenic germs were isolated: 2 S. London, 1 S. Wien, 1 S. Blokey and 1 Shigella. The S. Wien proved resistant to several antibiotics. Discussing the technical and epidemiological aspects of this investigation, particularly in relation to the recent epidemic of S. Wien and to the increasing isolation of germs which present polychemoantiobioticoresistance, the importance of the health carrier is stressed along with the need to obtain an antibiogram before therapy to help eliminate germs resistance to several antibiodics.
