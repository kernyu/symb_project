The semisynthetic penicillin suncillin was compared in vitro with carbenicillin for its effectiveness against different P. aeruginosa strains and for stability in solution. Carbenicillin was about twice as effective against the strains employed, while suncillin maintained its activity in saline for a longer time. The induction of resistance to suncillin was accompanied by the simultaneous development of resistance to the other antibiotic.
