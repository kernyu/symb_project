1. The effects of CNS depressants (methadone and alcohol) and natural neurotransmitters (NA and ACh) are studied in O. degus. 2. O. degus shows resistance to methadone in the formalin algesiometric test and EEG. 3. Ethanol elimination profile suggest the presence of an atypical alcohol dehydrogenase in O. degus 4. O. degus is extremely resistant to the pressor effects of noradrenaline 5. the isolated atrium of this rodent is 40 times more sensitive to the negative chronotropic effect of methadone, than the rat atrium. 6. These effects could be explained in terms of an important catecholamine and endorphin co-secretion from adrenal glands in O. degus.
