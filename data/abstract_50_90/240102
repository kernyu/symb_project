The purification and characterization of the streptolytic exo-enzyme from the Maxted-McCarty strain of Streptomyces albus is described. This enzyme was shown to be an endo-N-acetylmuramidase with a molecular weight of 10 to 12,000 and optimal activity at pH 8 and 45 degrees C. The enzyme is lytic for streptococci of various groups, Micrococcus lysodeikticus, Staphylococcus aureus, as well as Escherichia coli. It closely resembles the F1 endo-N-acetylmuramidase described by Ghuysen et al. (1966) except for small differences in the products of lysis of streptococcal cell walls and the resistance of Escherichia coli to lysis by the F1 enzyme. Lysates of group A and A variant streptococcal cell walls prepared with purified Streptomyces albus muramidase contained serologically active M protein and C carbohydrate-peptidoglycan complexes. The chemical and immunological characteristics of these enzymmatic products of streptococcal cell walls are reported and their utility as immunologic reagents is described.
