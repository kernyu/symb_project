Nine hemin-deficient mutants of Salmonella typhimurium LT2 were isolated as neomycin-resistant colonies. Five of these mutants could be stimulated by Delta-aminolevulinic acid (Delta-ALA), thus representing hemA mutants. Since S. typhimurium LT2 is not able to incorporate hemin, the identification of the mutants not stimulated by Delta-ALA was made on the basis of the simultaneous loss of catalase activity and cytochromes. The hemA gene was mapped by conjugation in the trp region, probably in the order purB-pyrD-hemA-trp; the episome FT(71)trp does not carry the hemA gene. Transductional intercrosses by phage P22 indicate that hemA 11, 12, 13, and 37 are at very closely linked sites, whereas hemA14 is at a more distant site in the same or an adjacent gene. No joint transduction was detected between hemA and trp or pyrF. The loci affected in the other hemin-deficient mutants were linked in conjugation to the pro(+) marker (frequency of linkage, 88 to 97%), but cotransduction of the two markers could not be obtained. The episome F lac hem purE, which originates from Escherichia coli K-12, could complement these hemin-deficient mutants of S. typhimurium LT2. As a result, the sequence of the markers on the chromosome of S. typhimurium LT2 is probably pro heme purE, analogous to the sequence found in E. coli K-12. Thus, the chromosome of S. typhimurium also possesses two hem regions, with a location similar to that described in E. coli K-12.
