A new type of hydrolyzable ester of penicillin G, benzamidomethyl benzylpenicillinate (FI 7303), was studied for the antibacterial activity and kinetics of absorption in comparison with DBED-penicillin G. FI 7303 resulted to be a good repository form of penicillin G, slowly eliminated in mouse, dog and man. It exerted a remarkable therapeutic activity in mice infected with Staphylococcus aureus even when administered 26 h before infection. The protective effect in mice was more prolonged than that of DBED-penicillin G, in agreement with the longer persistence of significant blood levels.
