The MIC of benzylpenicillin, ampicillin, ceporin, streptomycin, kanamycin, gentamicin, tetracycline, rondomycin, rifampicin, chloramphenicol, nalidixic acid, orafuran, furacin and furazolidon with respect to E. coli strains isolated from urological patients were determined and compared with those isolated from patients with other localization of inflammatory processes and the feces of healthy persons. It was shown that the strains isolated from the urine of the urological patients were characterized by higher levels of the drug resistance and as a rule were polyresistant. The bacterial resistance was due to the presence of conjugative R plasmids in 26-32 per cent of the cases and nonconjugative R plasmids in 37-38 per cent of the cases. The total number of the cultures with the drug resistance controlled by the plasmid markers amounted to 64-69 per cent. Ceporin, gentamicin, and furacin had the highest inhibitory effect.
