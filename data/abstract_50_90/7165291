The methods of serial dilutions and agar diffusion in medium AGV were used in the study on sensitivity of 200 NAG-vibrio strains to 10 antibiotics. The regression equations showing the relation between the MIC log2 and the diameter of the zones of the vibrio growth inhibition around the standard discs with the antibiotics were estimated. An evaluation table was developed for semiquantitative interpretation of the diameters of the inhibition zones of the vibrio growth when the agar diffusion method was used. A possibility of rapid estimation of the results in determination of the vibrio sensitivity to antibiotics with the methods of serial dilutions and agar diffusion is shown.
