Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) were cultured from the anterior nares of surgeons, theatre and ward staff, and from patients before and 2 weeks after a total hip replacement. The CNS found in ward staff were more resistant to antibiotics than those in surgeons and theatre staff. Methicillin resistance of CNS in patients increased from 4 to 31% following surgery. Gentamicin-resistant CNS were only found postoperatively, in 20% of patients, in most of whom gentamicin-loaded acrylic bone cement was used.
