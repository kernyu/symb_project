A 2 gram single dose of metronidazole was given to ten patients suffering from nonspecific vaginitis. At follow-up a week later seven of these patients were clinically and microbiologically free from infection. The remaining three patients had persisting symptoms and both clinical and microbiological findings confirmed treatment failure. Despite the small numbers entered into the trial to date, a cure rate of only seven out of ten patients suggests that a 2 gram single dose of metronidazole is inadequate treatment for non-specific vaginitis.
