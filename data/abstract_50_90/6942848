We administered a combination of rubidazone, cytosine arabinoside, vincristine, and prednisone (ROAP) to 91 patients with acute myelogenous leukemia who were 50 yr of age or older. These patients had been identified in previous studies to be a group with a relatively poor prognosis. One-third of the patients had an antecedent hematologic disorder prior to treatment. Forty patients (48%) obtained a complete hematologic and clinical remission. A history of an antecedent hematologic disorder, male sex, and absence of Auer rods were adverse factors for achieving remission in this older population. More than half of the patients achieved remission in one course. The major cause of failure to obtain a remission was death due to infection, 40% of which were caused by fungi. Resistance to chemotherapy, although uncommon, was noted more frequently in patients with an antecedent hematologic disorder. Univariate and multivariate prognostic factor analysis was used to compare these patients with a historical control group treated with a program in which adriamycin was used instead of rubidazone (AdOAP). No significant difference in remission rate was detected. Cyclocytidine was used as a maintenance agent in this study, and while the median remission duration was only 37 wk, 30% of patients are expected to be in remission for 2 yr. Chemotherapy programs combining an anthracycline with cytosine arabinoside, given to older patients in similar fasion to younger patients will achieve remissions in one-half of a group of older patients. These remissions are of comparable quality to those of younger patients. Mathematical models derived from analysis of prognostic factors are of use in identifying patients likely to fail these programs who are in need of innovative approaches to treatment.
