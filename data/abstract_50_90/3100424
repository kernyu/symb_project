The in vitro activity of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin against 33 strains of mycobacteria was investigated in a comparative study. The resulting MIC values were compared with serum levels, measured in a cross-over study. Possible therapeutic application of these substances in mycobacterial infections are being discussed. We found the antimycobacterial activity of ciprofloxacin to be insufficient for its clinical application, whereas the corresponding MIC values for ofloxacin could be achieved in vivo. Further animal and clinical studies appear justified.
