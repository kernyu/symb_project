Serum lipoproteins have received considerable notoriety as risk factors for atherosclerotic disease, yet the kinetic factors that determine serum concentrations are often unappreciated. Simple compartmental models for lipoprotein kinetics are herein presented which integrate key features of lipoprotein metabolism and allow prediction of very low-density lipoprotein and low-density lipoprotein levels in a wide variety of clinical circumstances. Possible changes in kinetic parameters responsible for hyperlipidemia in obesity, insulin resistance, diabetes, carbohydrate (sugar)-induced hypertriglyceridemia, alcoholic type V hyperlipemia, polyunsaturated fat diets, and several pharmacological interventions are discussed. Key features of lipoprotein metabolism are briefly reviewed.
