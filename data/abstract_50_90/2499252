To detect a change in antibiotic susceptibility patterns in Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates upon the introduction and clinical use of ciprofloxacin, aztreonam, and ceftazidime, MICs for clinical isolates collected before introduction of the antibiotics, during early clinical use, and later were determined for these and seven other antipseudomonal antibiotics. Concomitant resistance to two or more antibiotics was also studied. Over the three study periods, rates of susceptibility to 9 of the 10 antibiotics decreased. The largest decrease occurred with ceftazidime. Analysis of subsets of isolates from patients treated with ciprofloxacin or aztreonam also showed declining susceptibility to the latter but a stabilization of susceptibility to the former after an initial decline. Concomitant resistance within and among antibiotic classes was common.
