The largest R . BamHI fragment of the plasmid F, which carries the entire F conjugation system, has been cloned into the single R . BamHI site of the ampicillin (Ap) resistance transposon TN1. pDS1106 (ColE1 mob::Tn1) was the vector plasmid, and the resultant conjugative plasmid, pED830, was characterized both genetically and by restriction enzyme analysis. The transposon construct, denoted Tn2301, was transposable at frequencies similar to Tn1 to small nonconjugative plasmids or to the Escherichia coli host chromosome. In the former case, Apr conjugative plasmids were obtained, whereas in the latter case, Hfr strains resulted. Representative Hfr strains were characterized by quantitative and interrupted mating experiments. Extension of this technique for Hfvr formation should aid chromosome mapping both in E. coli and in other bacterial genera.
