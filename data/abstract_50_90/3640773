Commercial latex agglutination tests (LATs) for the simultaneous detection of clumping factor and protein A are gaining increased acceptance as a means of identifying Staphylococcus aureus. We evaluated two LATs (Accu-Staph; Carr-Scarborough, Decatur, Ga.; Staphaurex; Wellcome, Dartford, England) with particular emphasis on their ability to correctly identify oxacillin-resistant S. aureus. We tested 59 oxacillin-resistant S. aureus, 136 oxacillin-susceptible S. aureus, and 92 coagulase-negative staphylococcal strains with the two LATs and with thermonuclease, slide clumping factor, tube coagulase, and protein A hemagglutination tests. Clumping factor and protein A were present in 96.9 and 82.1% of our S. aureus strains, respectively. Accu-Staph correctly identified 92.8% and Staphaurex correctly identified 91.3% of S. aureus strains. No significant difference in LAT positivity rates, presence of clumping factor, or presence of protein A was found between oxacillin-resistant and -susceptible S. aureus. Overall, there were 31 false-negative LATs for 20 S. aureus strains, 14 with Accu-Staph and 17 with Staphaurex. Ninety-five percent of these strains possessed either clumping factor or protein A or both when these factors were determined independently. There were five false-positive LATs for four strains of coagulase-negative staphylococci (three Staphylococcus epidermidis and one Staphylococcus warneri), four with Accu-Staph and one with Staphaurex. Clumping factor was present in one S. warneri strain. Thus, the specificities of Accu-Staph, Staphaurex, and the clumping factor test were 95.6, 98.9, and 98.9%, respectively. Our results indicated that LATs identify oxacillin-resistant and -susceptible S. aureus equally well; however, they offer no greater sensitivity or specificity than the clumping factor test for identification of S. aureus.
