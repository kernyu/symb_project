Ciprofloxacin is a new quinolone derivative which is particularly well adapted for the treatment of bacterial urinary tract infection. Virtually all uropathogens are susceptible, and the development of resistance is uncommon. Its pharmacokinetic characteristics reveal that effective concentrations of the drug are easily achieved with twice a day oral therapy in the blood, urine, kidneys, and prostate--even in advanced renal failure. The drug is well tolerated, even with prolonged courses of therapy. It will be particularly useful in the treatment of antibiotic-resistant, complicated, and/or prostatic infection.
