DNA gyrase is an essential enzyme in bacterial metabolism. Its function is the introduction of negative supercoils into DNA. These favour the unwinding of certain parts of DNA und thus are likely to facilitate processes like replication and transcription. Inhibition of DNA gyrase by quinolones and possible effects on the structure of DNA are reviewed.
