Group D streptococci isolated from clinical specimens and from sewage were investigated with regard to resistance to tetracycline (Tc), erythromycin (Em), and chloramphenicol (Cm). The median values of the percentages of resistant strains from sewage were: for Tc, 14%; for Em, 2.8%; and for Cm, 0.1%. For the recent isolates of clinical origin, resistance percentages found were 58% for Tc, 12% for Em, and 14% for Cm, and, in comparison to clinical isolates from 1964, the incidence of drug resistance slightly increased. In strains of both sources, the drug resistance was often found to be transferable to another group D streptococcus, probably by conjugation. Two strains were able to transfer their Em resistance to a streptococcus strain of group B. No transfer of drug resistance to a group A streptococcus and Escherichia coli was observed. All beta-hemolytic streptococci were also bacteriocinogenic, and frequently these properties were found to be transferable. The function, size, and base composition of the plasmids of two drug-resistant Streptococcus faecalis strains were investigated; strain M439 harbors at least two conjugative plasmids: pRI401, molecular weight 30 x 10(6), coding for Tc resistance, and pRI402, molecular weight 41 x 10(6), coding for Em resistance. Strain M403 carries one single conjugative plasmid species, coding for Tc resistance. The molecular weight of this plasmid, pRI404, was 37 x 10(6). The guanine plus cytosine content of these plasmids was 35 to 36%.
