Mutagenic effects and DNA degradation in Escherichia coli cells treated with potassium bichromate were studied in this work. It is estimated that events taking place in cells treated with the mutagen are controlled by recB recC and sbcB gene products. The method for sedimentation analysis has revealed DNA degradation. The use of the impulse label of 3H-thymidine made it possible to detect DNA breaks in the daughter strands. This effect of potassium bichromate on DNA degradation is, possibly, connected with mutagenic repair.
