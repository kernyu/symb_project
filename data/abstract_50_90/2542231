High-level expression of the Tn10 tetracycline resistance protein TetA in Escherichia coli caused partial collapse of the membrane potential, arrest of growth, and killing of the cells. Since alpha-methylglucoside transport was not affected, the overproduced TetA protein may cause not destruction of membrane structure but rather unrestricted translocation of protons and/or ions across the membrane.
