Thyroid iodoprotein from rats fed a high-iodine diet (HID) or a low-iodine diet (LID) were labeled with radioiodine in vivo for periods ranging from 4 hr to several days. Standardized aliquots of thyroid homogenate from rats with various treatments were digested for 4 hr with 1% pancreatin or with 0.003% pancreatin after 30 min pretreatment with beta-mercaptoethanol (ME-P). Four-hr labeled iodoprotein from both LID and HID rats was equally susceptible to digestion with 1% pancreatin; however, such iodoprotein from LID rats was more susceptible to digestion with ME-P than that from HID rats. With increasing intervals up to 7 days between administering radioiodine and removing the thyroids, there was a progressive rise in the resistance to digestion in iodoprotein from LID rats, but only a slight increase in resistance in iodoprotein from HID rats. If propylthiouracil was added to the diet beginning 24 hr after radioiodine administration, there was a marked increase in the rate of development of resistance of iodoprotein to digestion. Radioautographs showed that the radioiodine was localized primarily in the peripheral follicles after 2 days PTU. Similar differences in susceptibility to digestion were found in purified thyrogobulin prepared from HID and LID rats. No change in susceptibility to digestion of thyroid iodoprotein with time after labeling was seen in hypophysectomized LID rats in which thyroid secretion and thyroglobulin turnover is known to proceed at an extremely slow rate. The data indicate that there are at least two types of iodinated thyroglobulin in the rat thyroid. One is readily susceptible to digestion and has a rapid turnover in the thyroid. The other is more resistant to digestion, has a slow rate of turnover and is located primarily in the peripheral follicles.
