Synthesis and antibacterial activity of 7-[2-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-3-carboxy-2-propenoamido]cepha los porins and their derivatives are described. These compounds are of interest as carbon analogues of oximecephalosporins, 7-[2-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-2(Z)-oxyiminoacetamido]cephalo spo rins having remarkable antibacterial activity. The synthesized 7-[2-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-3(Z)-carboxy-2-propenoamido]-c eph alosporins (14, 19) show improved activity especially against the beta-lactamase-producing strains. A 7-[2-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl) maleimido]cephalosporin (15) has been also prepared by cyclization of 7-[3-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-2-ethoxycarbonyl-2(Z)-propenoamido++ +]cephalosporin.
