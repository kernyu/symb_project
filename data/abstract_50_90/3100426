8.4% of the isolated Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains were resistant against imipenem in this study. 3.7% of them became resistant as a result of the antibiotic therapy. In some patients on intensive care units, the resistance of Pseudomonas aeruginosa against imipenem emerged within a few days. In two of these cases a simultaneous loss of activity of the other pseudomonas-beta-lactams was observed.
