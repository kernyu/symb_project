Robenidine protected chickens against cecal coccidiosis infections initiated by a strain of the parasite that had no previous exposure to drugs. No cross resistance was found with 13 strains resistant to other anticoccidials. A strain of Eimeria tenella that was serially propagated in chickens fed mash containing robenidine became resistant to the chemical. No cross resistance was detected when this experimental strain was tested against 12 other anticoccidials.
