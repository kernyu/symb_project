The purpose of this study was to test whether a parenteral infusion of ethanol had any influence on pulmonary function or cardio-pulmonary capacity. 11 healthy male test persons supplied with an infusion of 0.4 g ethanol per kg body weight in isotonic saline (25--38 g ethanol) and of 400 mls of isotonic solution alternatively. The following measurements were taken: Body-plethysmography, Ergospirometry using a bicycle ergometer, ECG, measuring cardiac frequency, blood gases and lactate concentration. At average maximal alcohol blood levels of 0.61% we found a significant decrease of the residual volume without changes of the bronchial resistance. At increasing physical loads on the bicycle ergometer we found a significant decrease of the maximal oxygen uptake at the same watt ratings and the same maximal respiratory minute volume. The results indicate a shift of respiratory balance and a decrease of the cardiac output after supply of alcohol.
