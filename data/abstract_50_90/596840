In vitro efficacy of combinations of broad and narrow spectrum semi-synthetic penicillins, broad spectrum semi-synthetic penicillins with macrolides or aminoglycosides and tetracyclines with other biosynthetic antibiotics was studied with respect to the causative agents of surgical infections. Correlation between the sensitivity of the isolates and the antibiotics levels in the organism of the surgical patients was shown. The role of the etiological factor in the development of the post-operative complications in the patients after surgical operations on the heart was elucidated. The most rational schemes of the antibiotic use in therapy of the patients with purulent complications after operations on the open heart were developed and the maximum doses of different semi-synthetic penicillins for the treatment of patients with purulent processes after operations under conditions of artificial blood circulation were determined.
