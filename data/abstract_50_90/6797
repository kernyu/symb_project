Sensitivity to pentamidine of bloodstream forms and culture forms of Trypanosoma brucei brucei, strains of this subspecies, and strains of T. brucei rhodesiense characteristically differs in vitro. Analyses of transport parameters for pentamidine uptake in these organisms show differences that correspond with drug sensitivity. Long slender bloodstream forms of T. b. brucei have a high affinity for the drug and high rates of uptake at indicated by Km and Vmax values for [3H]pentamidine transport. Although pentamidine and stilbamidine resistance is associated with dyskinetoplasty, this condition does not itself confer resistance to pentamidine nor does it affect pentamidine transport. However, drug-resistant strains show lower rates for pentamidine transport as does T. b. rhodesiense, which is characteristically less sensitive to the drug. Of all the forms and strains studied, procyclic trypomastigotes were least sensitive to pentamidine and had a remarkable ability to exclude the drug.
