In 1981 a comparison of the resistance rates of aminoglycosides, penicillins, cephalosporins, and nalidixic acid was made in species of gram-negative rods between a hospital in Toulouse, France and one in Brooklyn, New York. The results showed similar rates of resistance from both institutions. Both institutions showed high rates of aminoglycoside resistance; high ampicillin resistance among salmonella and Pseudomonas mirabilis in France and shigella in New York City; similar rates of resistance to cephalosporins and finally, markedly different incidences of resistance to naladixic acid. Analysis of medical records over several years indicated a gradual but continuing increase in resistance to aminoglycosides. The majority of such isolates had been isolated from patients in intensive care units. Few differences in the rates of resistance to the cephalosporins were noted between the two institutions, either for the older or newer agents in this group. Further, no increase in resistance was noted to this group of antibiotics in the previous 5 yr.
