A series of Bacillus subtilis plasmids was constructed which carry either the leu region or both the leu and the dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) regions of the B. subtilis chromosome. The DHFR-coding gene was derived from a trimethoprim resistant (Tmpr) B. subtilis strain, and cells harboring the DHFR plasmid showed resistance to trimethoprim (Tmp). One such leu+tmpr plasmid, pTL12, was found to be useful for cloning DNA fragments at the BamHI, EcoRI, BglII and XmaI sites. It was also shown that insertion of DNA fragments at the BamHI and XmaI sites of pTL12 inactivated the leuA gene function (insertional inactivation) but not tmpr, indicating that cells carrying recombinant plasmids can be detected easily by selecting Leu-Tmpr colonies. Combination of B. subtilis 168 and plasmid pTL12 should serve as an efficient homologous cloning system in B. subtilis.
