The genetic determinant responsible for adherence in one strain of Lactobacillus reuteri isolated from chicken crop has been investigated. After curing experiments carried out on this strain, a plasmid-free derivative was obtained, resulting unchanged as regards adhesion ability and carbohydrate fermentation pattern, but showing a loss of antibiotic resistances. It is suggested a possible localization on chromosome of adhesion determinant.
