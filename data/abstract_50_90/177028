In the present report evaluation of the possible metabolic changes in partially revertants of M. tuberculosis var. hominis, reisolated from strains at high levels of drug-resistance after treatment with mutagenic agents, was reported. Based on the data presented here, it must be concluded that no significant biological and biochemical differences in mycobacterial cells revertant from high mutants mono-resistant to four aminoglycosides (Sm, Kana, Vio, Neo) and p-aminonasalicylic acid (PAS) are to be found.
