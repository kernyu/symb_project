The effects of forskolin on the electrophysiological parameters of the isolated corneal epithelium from bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana) were investigated. Forskolin stimulated the short-circuit current (SCC) and transepithelial potential difference (PDt), while reducing the transepithelial resistance. These effects were absent in Cl- -free bathing solutions. Furosemide, added either before or after forskolin, completely blocked the effects. Epinephrine and A23187, added after forskolin, produced only a small additional stimulation of the SCC. Propranolol neither blocked nor reduced the effect of forskolin. Forskolin increased the stroma to tear 36Cl flux by 61% and the tear to stroma 36Cl flux by 64%. Intracellular recordings showed that forskolin depolarized the potential difference across the apical membrane and reduced the apical/basolateral resistance ratio. Intracellular recordings in the isolated rabbit epithelium showed the same effects by forskolin except that there was only a brief stimulation of PDt, after which it stabilized slightly below the control level. These results are consistent with an increase in apical membrane permeability similar to that produced by adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate, epinephrine, and the Ca2+ ionophore A23187.
