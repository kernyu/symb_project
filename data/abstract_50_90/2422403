Genomic Southern blots of mouse-hamster somatic cell hybrids were analyzed with a probe prepared from a cDNA encoding murine Mx protein, the product of the interferon-regulated influenza virus resistance allele Mx+. Results of this analysis indicate that the Mx gene is located on mouse chromosome 16. In appropriate backcross mice, no linkage was observed between Mx and md, a marker previously mapped close to the centromere of chromosome 16, suggesting a more distal localization of Mx.
