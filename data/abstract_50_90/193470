Phagocytosis begins with exocytosis--"extrarapid" discharge of bactericidal proteins and factors of permeability into the extracellular medium. A viewpoint was put forward on an "avalanch-like" character of the outcome of cationic proteins from leukocyte granules in inflammation and their participation in formation of a nonphagocytic type of resistance. In phagocytosis bacteria perish due to the myeloperoxidase system, lysozyme, lactoferin and nonenzymic cationic proteins. Hereditary deficit of the above-mentioned substances leads to intraleukocytic microbicidal insufficiency, a drastic decrease in the nonspecific resistance of the organism and to development of fatal granulomatous disease, and to other forms of pathology associated with genetic defects of the bactericidal systems of leukocytes.
