Tuberculosis appears to be a diagnostic challenge and an important therapeutical problem in industrialized and in developing countries, where most infections occur. Besides several rifamycin derivatives, new molecules (fluorinated quinolones, macrolides, beta-lactam antibiotics) are being explored in the face of increasing bacterial-resistance with the aim of improving the efficacy and safety of anti-tuberculous drugs, shortening the period of treatment or allowing intermittent regimens. At present, in severe forms of the disease three or more of the available anti-tuberculous agents must be administered simultaneously for at least 3-4 months and two for the following 6-7 months. Nevertheless, a variety of highly effective 6 months regimens are currently used for the treatment of less severe tuberculosis.
