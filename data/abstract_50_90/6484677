Although a global resurgence of malaria has occurred along with the appearance of drug resistant organisms, this illness rarely is encountered by physicians in the United States. We report our experience with 15 cases of malaria seen during the last five years. The diagnosis should be considered in any febrile patient who has visited or resided in an area endemic for malaria, has received a transfusion, or is a narcotic addict. Confirmation of the diagnosis is obtained by blood smears for malaria parasites. Treatment is determined by the species and drug resistance of the parasite. Chemoprophylaxis is urged for visitors to countries endemic for malaria.
