The use of colloidal bismuth subcitrate (CBS) has been recently suggested for cimetidine-resistant duodenal ulcers. We have therefore compared the activity of CBS with that of two different doses of cimetidine in patients whose duodenal ulcers had not healed after 8 weeks of therapy with cimetidine, 1.2 g, or ranitidine, 300 mg/day. Forty-three patients (35 men and 8 women) were randomly allocated to one of the following oral regimens: CBS, 120 mg 4 times a day, or cimetidine (C), 400 mg 3 times a day, or cimetidine, 400 mg at meals plus 800 mg at bedtime, for 4-8 weeks. The interim analysis after 4 weeks of treatment showed similar percentages of healing in the two cimetidine schedules (46.7% with C, 1.2 g, and 42.9% with C, 2 g, respectively); conversely, CBS treatment resulted in a significantly higher healing rate as compared with both C, 1.2 g, and C, 2 g (P less than 0.05). These findings suggest that resistant duodenal ulcers are more responsive to cytoprotective agents than to antisecretory compounds.
