Normal human fibroblasts (MRC-5 or NTI-4) were transfected with pSV2-neo plasmid DNA. Fifty G418-resistant fibroblast clones were isolated and independently fused to mouse A9 cells. The cell hybrids were selected and isolated in the medium containing G418 plus ouabain. Since micronuclei were more efficiently induced in these hybrids compared to parental human fibroblasts by colcemid treatment, the transfer of neo-tagged human chromosomes in the hybrids to mouse A9 cells was performed via microcell fusion. Two hundred A9 microcell hybrids were isolated and karyotyped. Among them, thirteen microcell clones, each containing a single human chromosome 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 15, 18, 19 or 20 were established. Isozyme analyses conformed the presence of each human chromosome in these A9 microcell clones. The results of Southern blot and chromosomal in situ hybridization analyses indicate that the human chromosomes in these clones were tagged with pSV2-neo plasmid DNA.
