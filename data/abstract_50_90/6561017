FK 027 was more active than cefaclor, cephalexin, and amoxicillin against stock strains of a wide variety of gram-negative bacteria, including such opportunistic pathogens as Citrobacter and Enterobacter species and Serratia marcescens. FK 027 was significantly more active than the three reference drugs against clinical isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, indole-positive and -negative Proteus species, Providencia species, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. It was less active than cefaclor, cephalexin, and amoxicillin against staphylococci, but it was similar to cefaclor in its activity against streptococci. With few exceptions, FK 027 was active against strains of E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis that were resistant to the reference agents. The bactericidal activity of FK 027 against various gram-negative bacteria, including Proteus species, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogenes, and S. marcescens, was greater than that of cefaclor, cephalexin, and amoxicillin. The therapeutic activities of FK 027 in mice infected with gram-negative bacilli were far superior to the activities of cefaclor, cephalexin, and amoxicillin, but they were inferior to the activities of these reference drugs against infection with Staphylococcus aureus.
