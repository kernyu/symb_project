A double blind pilot study was done to compare the efficacy and safety of treatment of uncomplicated gonorrhoea with two dosages of enoxacin. Eleven patients were treated with 600 mg enoxacin as a single oral dose and eleven patients were given 400 mg twice with an interval of 4 h. A cure rate of 100% was found with both dosages. No side effects were noted and there were no abnormalities in haematological tests or renal and hepatic function tests after treatment. MIC's of enoxacin and other relevant antibiotics were determined. A single oral dose of 600 mg enoxacin seems sufficient to cure uncomplicated gonorrhoea and warrants further investigation in more patients.
