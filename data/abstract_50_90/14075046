The presence of oxytetracycline-resistant bacteria was investigated with commercially frozen chicken thighs and drumsticks. Bacterial flora were surveyed by means of total and coliform counts with Tryptone Glucose Extract Agar and Desoxycholate Agar, respectively. After counting, the Desoxycholate Agar plates were replicated on the same medium containing 25, 50, 75, and 100 ppm of oxytetracycline. Resistant colonies were found on all samples that were replicated. Of 2613 colonies isolated on Desoxycholate Agar, 47.8% grew in the presence of 25 ppm of oxytetracycline. From 50 to 100 ppm, the number of resistant isolates remained essentially the same, near 34%. Of 812 colonies of antibiotic-resistant bacteria identified with dulcitol-lactose-iron-agar, 82.5% were paracolons, 13.7% were pseudomonads, and 3.8% were Escherichia or Aerobacter. Bacteria resistant to oxytetracycline were shown to be present on commercially processed chicken. The origin of the resistance to oxytetracycline was not established; however, since the antibiotic was not used during processing, it appeared that these antibiotic-resistant bacteria arose in the intestines of the chickens as a result of feed which contained antibiotic. This is supported by a comparison with the antibiotic resistance of coliforms from chickens raised on feed both with and without oxytetracycline, for the percentages of resistant colonies are similar in both commercial chicken and chicken raised on feed containing the antibiotic.
