Six patients in a thoracic unit developed sternal osteomyelitis and costochondritis following median sternotomy. Five of the patients were operated on in another hospital. Gentamicin and methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus was isolated in pure culture in each case. The S. aureus isolate from 2 patients was of the same phage type suggesting cross-infection. Antibiotic prophylaxis administered in the perioperative period was ineffective. One patient, treated with amikacin (to which all of the strains were sensitive in vitro) and cefuroxime, died from overwhelming infection in spite of debridement and resuturing of the wound. The remaining 5 patients were cured with vancomycin therapy usually coupled with surgical intervention.
