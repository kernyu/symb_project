Semiselective mesenteric arteriography was performed at regular intervals (inoculation weeks [IW] 0, 11, 18, and 24) in 9 of 10 pony foals raised to be free of parasites. Fifty infective larvae (L3) of Strongylus vulgaris were administered weekly for 4 weeks, then every 2 weeks through the 20th week. Three ponies were given ivermectin (oral paste, 0.2 mg/kg of body weight) treatment at IW 8, 16 and 24. Four ponies were inoculated, but did not receive ivermectin, and a third group of 2 ponies acted as uninoculated controls. Control ponies did not have gross or arteriographic lesions, whereas the inoculated untreated ponies had gross and progressive arteriographic lesions typical of verminous arteritis. Arteriographic lesions in the ivermectin-treated inoculated ponies were not as severe those in the untreated inoculated group, and there was either a partial resolution or a lack of progression of arteriographic lesions in all treated ponies. One untreated inoculated pony did not have progressive arterial lesions as did the 3 others in the group, and may develop resistance to the parasite.
