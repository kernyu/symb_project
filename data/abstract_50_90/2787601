A postpartum patient had a unilateral breast infection that responded to cephalosporin treatment. During therapy, the contralateral breast developed a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection. The patient was hospitalized and treated successfully with intravenous vancomycin. Obstetricians should be alert to this possibility when treating patients with postpartum mastitis.
