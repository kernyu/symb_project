The structure of drug resistance was studied on 2788 clinical strains of staphylococci isolated from various materials of patients with purulent-inflammatory processes, stuff and environment within 12 years from 1968 to 1973. The number of staphylococci resistant to tetracycline increased 13 times among the cultures with resistance marker, while the number of staphylococci resistant to penicillin decreased 1-8 times. The study of the complex resistance revealed the predominance of staphylococci with tetracycline resistance structure (60-5 percent).
