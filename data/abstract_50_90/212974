Exposure of HSV/1 to low concentrations of ribavirin during 4--5 passages does not produce ribavirin-resistant virus. IDU resistance was developed by HSV/1 while it was being passed simultaneously. This resistance was seen to develop in both KB and Vero cells. The IDU-resistant virus is also resistant to ribavirin in KB cells.
