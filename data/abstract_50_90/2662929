A significant decrease in resistance to infections caused by gramnegative pathogens was observed in mice with neutropenia induced by cytostatics. Efficacy of schemes for combined chemotherapy with beta-lactams, aminoglycosides and a novel peptide antibiotic was studied on model infections in mice with neutropenia. In the neutropenic mice with sepsis caused by Pseudomonas the peptide antibiotic administered parenterally in a single dose of 50 micrograms/kg provided high therapeutic activity. In combination with azlocillin, cefotaxime and amikacin the peptide antibiotic has a synergistic therapeutic action.
