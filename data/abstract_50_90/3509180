Clinical and laboratory evidence is reviewed which shows that there is a great deal of variation in the susceptibility of Schistosoma mansoni to oxamniquine. This variation occurs both among endemic regions and within endemic regions in Brazil and Kenya. It is genetically controlled. It is suggested that the parasite possesses a large capacity for developing resistance to the drug and that resistance will develop where sufficient drug pressure is maintained.
