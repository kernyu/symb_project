The conditions required to kill Serratia marcescens with nalidixic acid, ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin or ofloxacin were determined in nutrient broth and in phosphate-buffered saline. They were found to be similar to the conditions required for these 4-quinolones to kill Escherichia coli. Bacterial RNA synthesis and bacterial cell division were essential for the bactericidal activity of nalidixic acid but all three fluoroquinolones were bactericidal against non-dividing S. marcescens. However, as with E. coli, bacterial RNA synthesis was essential for the bactericidal activity of norfloxacin though this was not required to kill S. marcescens with ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin.
