A total of 97 anaerobic bacteria were tested for susceptibility to ampicillin, ampicillin-sulbactam, and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid by broth microdilution and disk elution methods, the results of which were compared with those of the reference agar dilution method. With the broth microdilution method, approximately 95% of MICs were within 1 dilution of those of the reference agar method, with a definite (0.6 to 0.7 dilution) trend toward lower MICs. The disk elution test performed satisfactorily, but additional anaerobic isolates resistant to ampicillin-sulbactam and/or amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (currently rare) are needed to assure the predictability of resistance by the disk elution test.
