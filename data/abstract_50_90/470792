The efficacy of amikacin was evaluated in 32 patients with urinary infections due to hospital-acquired rods. Treatment with amikacin was successful in all cases of acute urinary infection by gentamicin-resistent gram-negative strains. Amikacin shares with other aminoglycosides the risk of nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity. Follow-up studies are preferable to patients already suffering from damage of hearing. Lesions of n. vestibularis were relatively infrequent.
