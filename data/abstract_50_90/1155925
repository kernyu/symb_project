One hundred and two Shigella sonnei and fourteen S. flexneri strains isolated from individual patients in New York City hospitals were investigated for antibiotic resistance. The S. sonnei showed 60% resistance to ampicillin and 58% to tetracycline and streptomycin. S. flexneri showed no ampicillin resistance but 50% resistance to tetracycline. There were marked differences in resistance of S. sonnei between hospitals which were not explainable by ethnic or socio-economic differences in the patient populations.
