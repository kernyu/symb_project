Lactobacilli constitute a significant part of the microbial population in the gastrointestinal tract of humans and animals. Sensitivity of intestinal lactobacilli to 11 chemotherapeutic drugs was tested with the method of serial dilutions in the solid medium MRS under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Criteria for dividing the organisms into sensitive and resistant ones with respect to the drugs are proposed. Prevalence of lactobacilli polyresistant strains in the intestine contents of healthy persons at the age of 25 to 50 years being in prolonged constant contact with antibiotics was shown. On the whole 77 various combinations of the antibiotic resistance markers were detected in 141 tested strains. The most frequent were isolated simultaneously resistant to 6 or 7 antibiotics. Different levels of the antibiotic resistance in the strains tested under the aerobic and anaerobic conditions were observed.
