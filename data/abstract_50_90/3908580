An evaluation of leprosy control project was undertaken in Dharmapuri and A. Pallipatti areas of Tamil Nadu to study the prevalence rate of drug resistance among the leprosy patients. At the end of 5 years of assessment 266 patients were still found to be bacteriologically positive among whom 25 patients were suspected to be clinically dapsone resistant. By mouse foot pad technique the drug resistant prevalence rate was found to be 1.1 per cent in these two areas.
