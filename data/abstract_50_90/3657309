Despite the introduction of newer, less toxic antimicrobial agents, the aminoglycosides remain useful in the treatment of serious, hospital-acquired, gram-negative bacillary infections, especially those caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Formidable nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity have limited the use of neomycin to topical or oral administration. Widespread antimicrobial resistance among Enterobacteriaceae has restricted the use of streptomycin and kanamycin to a few specific clinical situations. Gentamicin, tobramycin, and amikacin are active against a wide range of Enterobacteriaceae and many P. aeruginosa organisms. In medical centers where gentamicin resistance is prevalent, amikacin is the aminoglycoside of choice. Fortunately, amikacin resistance has not seemed to increase substantially, even in institutions where usage has been extensive for a long period. No new aminoglycoside has proved to be superior to amikacin.
