Presence of plasmid DNA was investigated in laboratory strains 2 and 4 (NRRL 2338) of S. erythreus, as well as in strains 1 and 3 of S. erythreus subjected to improvement with respect to erythromycin production. Families of plasmids close by their molecular weights were identified in S. erythreus strains 3 and 4 (NRRL 2338). A plasmid DNA fraction of S. erythreus strain 3 was studied with electron microscopy. It enabled to identify 5 plasmids: pSE11, pSE12, pSE13, pSE14 and pSE15 with length of 5.3, 12.4, 16.3, 29.6 and 86.9 kb respectively. Using of various procedures for isolation of extrachromosomal DNA did not provide its detection in S. erythreus strains 1 and 2. At least a part of the plasmids detected in S. erythreus strains 3 and 4 (NRRL 2338) was conjugative. 32R-Labeled plasmid DNA of S. erythreus strain 3 was subjected to hydridization according to Sauthern with total DNA of the 4 strains treated with restrictases BamHI, PstI and BgIII. The studies showed that the genome of S. erythreus strain 2 was not homologous with the probe while S. erythreus strain 1 contained one of the plasmids or its part in chromosome-integrated state. In strains 3 and 4 (NRRL 2338) of S. erythreus certain plasmid DNAs were present in both autonomous and chromosome-inserted states. 32P-Labeled gene of erythromycin resistance (ermE) was subjected to hybridization according to Southern with total DNA of the 4 strains and with DNA plasmid fraction of S. erythreus strain 3. The signal was positive only in hydridization of the probe with total DNA of S. erythreus strains 1, 3, and 4 (NRRL 2338).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
