The potent tumor promoter 12-0-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate (TPA) is also an excellant mitogen for 3T3 cells. We have previously isolated two independent variants, 3T3-TNR-2 and 3T3-TNR-9, that are unable to divide in response to TPA (Butler-Gralla and Herschman, 1981). We have now tested two components of the pleiotypic response, elevation of 2-deoxyglucose uptake and ornithine decarboxylase induction, in these cells. Basal levels of 2-deoxyglucose uptake were nearly tenfold higher in confluent 3T3-TNR-2 and 3T3-TNR-9 cells than in 3T3 cells. In contrast, basal ornithine decarboxylase levels were five- to tenfold lower in the variants. TPA stimulation of 2-deoxyglucose uptake was as great in absolute terms in the variant cell lines as that of 3T3 cells but was only half that observed with serum. TPA was unable to induce any elevation of ornithine decarboxylase in 3T3-TNR-9 cells. Although an elevation of ornithine decarboxylase levels occurred in 3T3-TNR-2 cells treated with TPA, the maximal specific activity in the variant was less than the unstimulated value for 3T3 cells.
