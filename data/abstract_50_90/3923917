PBS222 and pBS223 plasmids with a wide spectrum of bacterial hosts detected in strains of P. aeruginosa control resistance of the cells of P. aeruginosa ML4262 (PAO) and E. coli C600 to 300 and 200 micrograms/ml of oxytetracycline respectively increasing 15 and 20 times their resistance to the antibiotics. The constant of the antibiotic elimination from the cells of P. aeruginosa ML4262 containing pBS223 plasmid is 3.5 times higher than the entry constant, while the constants of the antibiotic entry and elimination in the cells containing pBS222 plasmid are almost the same. Accumulation of tetracycline by the cells containing pBS223 plasmid decreases 2.8 times and that by the cells containing pBS222 plasmid decreases 1.7 times. The determinants of tetracycline resistance in pBS222 and pBS223 plasmids may be referred to the class TetC.
