The cleavage maps of a Staphylococcus aureus plasmid, pSN1 (2.75 megadaltons), conferring tetracycline resistance, were determined. Cleavage maps are given for HpaI and HindIII restriction endonucleases by using the single HpaII site as a reference point. Nucleases EcoRI, BamHI, SalI, and HaeIII have no sites on this plasmid.
