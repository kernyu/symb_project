Morbidity and mortality among children with Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection in Pediatric Intensive Care Unit remains high. Delays in bacterial killing may be responsible for the poor outcome. Antimicrobial sensitivity and timed-killing assays were determined for ticarcillin, azlocillin, piperacillin, cefsulodin, ceftazidime, gentamicin, tobramycin and amikacin alone and in combination against 40 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from blood cultures and tracheal aspirate. Antibiotic concentrations used were at clinically achievable level. None bactericidal effect was observed with each beta-lactamin alone. However with the combinations azlocillin or piperacillin or cefsulodin or ceftazidime plus amikacin a bactericidal effect was observed at 4.5 hours.
