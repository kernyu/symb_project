A field survey was designed and carried out in parts of Kancheepuram and Tiruvannamalai Leprosy Control Units in Tamilnadu (population 418,000) with the objective of finding out the prevalence of secondary dapsone resistance among 790 lepromatous (LL and BL) cases, who formed the patient population at risk based on certain treatment criteria. Using the mouse footpad experiment, 3 resistant cases were identified in Kancheepuram Unit (prevalence rate of 1.0 per cent) and 11 cases in Tiruvannamalai Unit (prevalence rate of 2.2 per cent). The metabolic status of dapsone was found to be normal in more than 90% of the patients, showing no relationship to occurrence of resistance.
