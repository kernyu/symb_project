A 20-year-old woman receiving corticosteroid treatment for systemic lupus erythematosus developed pulmonary nocardiosis with hydrophneumothorax. The organism identified as Nocardia asteroides resisted to sulfonamide and cotrimoxazole but sensitive to chloramphenicaol and streptomycin in vitro. She seemed to respond to chloramphenicol but subsequently had peritonitis and succumbed later.
