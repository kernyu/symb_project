In a study on the primary humoral response of calves vaccinated against infectious bovine rhinotracheitis (IBR) and simultaneously given levamisole, mild but consistent suppression of the group's geometric mean serum-neutralization titer to IBR virus occurred between 12 and 59 days later. The quantitative determination of circulating immunoglobulins (Ig) over the same period indicated a slight decrease in the IgG concentrations from an initial geometric mean concentration of 18.28 mg/ml before calves were vaccinated to 15.29 mg/ml after vaccination, and the control calves (vaccinated and given saline solution only) maintained their prevaccination IgG geometric mean concentration of 20.92 mg/ml. Difference was not observed in the circulating IgM values of the 2 groups. Levamisole had no apparent effect on the circulating Ig-bearing lymphocyte values when compared with control calves during the 24 hours of treatment. It was concluded that a single treatment of levamisole may mildly suppress the primary humoral response to IBR vaccination in calves, but it is unlikely that this would affect the animal's capability to recover from, or maintain resistance to, IBR infection.
