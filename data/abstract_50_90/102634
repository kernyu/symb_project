Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain 9169 has been reported to contain a plasmid that expresses resistance to carbenicillin (Cb), kanamycin (Km), and tetracycline (Tc) in Escherichia coli but resistance only to Cb in certain Pseudomonas recipients. The triply resistant plasmid in E. coli belonged to incompatibility (Inc) group P or P-1, whereas the singly resistant plasmid in P. aeruginosa was compatible with IncP-1 plasmids and other plasmids of established Inc specificity but incompatible with plasmid pSR1 that is here used to define a new Pseudomonas Inc group P-10. Additional physical and genetic studies showed that strain 9169 contained not one but two plasmids: IncP-1 plasmid R91a, determining the Cb Km Tc phenotype, and IncP-10 plasmid R91, determining Cb that differed in molecular weight and in EcoRI and BamHI restriction endonuclease recognition sites. Plasmid multiplicity rather than host effects on plasmid gene expression can account for differences in the phenotype of strain 9169 transconjugants to E. coli and P. aeruginosa.
