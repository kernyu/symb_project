The authors carried out a study on 100 cases with broncho-pulmonary infections in two different periods: 1963--1964 and 1973--1974. Changes in the microbial flora were investigated, as well as the sensitivity of germs to antibiotics. An increase was noted in the number of chronic bronchitis and a decrease in the number of pneumonia cases. In the microbial flora there was a constant proportion of staphylococcus, streptococcus and coli strains. The proportion of micrococci decreased with time and pneumococci practically disappeared, being replaced by klebsiella germs. Sensitivity to penicilin remained almost identical while that to chloramphenicol decreased significantly, as well as sensitivity to tetracycline and neomycine. The practical conclusion is that in some cases the application of penicilin treatment, before the results of the antibiogram are available appears to be justified.
