Tetracycline, streptomycin and monomycin resistant variants of the cholera and NAG-vibrios were obtained by means of repeated passages on nutrient media with increasing concentrations of the antibiotics (114 variants V. cholerae asiaticae, 1337 variants of V. cholerae eltor and 299 variants of NAG-vibrios of the 1st Heiberg group). The highest number of the antibiotic resistant variants was obtained under the effect of streptomycin and the resistance level to it was much higher (up to 8000 gamma/ml) than that to tetracycline or monomycin (160 or 320 gamma/ml respectively). The study of the differential-diagnostic properties of the above vibrios showed that 14.8 per cent of the strains of V. cholerae asiaticae and 4.6 per cent of the strains of V. cholerae eltor became non-typical with respect to the colony morphology and fermentative properties. Their agglutinability with the species or type specific cholera sera partially decreased. Nine per cent out of 299 antibiotic resistant NAG-vibrios had changes only in the colony structure. None of them changed their fermentative properties or acquired even minor capacity for agglutination with cholera sera or lysing with specific bacteriophages. The described changes in the properties of the antibiotic resistant cholera and NAG-vibrios were not stable and disappeared after 2- or 3-fold passages on media containing no antibiotics.
