The inhibitory activity of some antifungal agents against 17 strains of genus Epidermophyton have been studied. The behaviour of Epidermophyton stockdaleae against antifungal agents tested is clearly different from that observed in the strains belonging to Epidermophyton floccosum, since all of the latter were sensitive to the antifungal agents used and the geophilic species showed resistance to griseofulvin, isoconazole, natamycin and nystatin, and intermediate sensitivity to ketoconazole and miconazole. The low sensitivity of E. stockdaleae (and other geophilic dermatophytes) to antifungal agents could be a problem in the current therapy if further studies or case reports demonstrate their pathogenic role.
