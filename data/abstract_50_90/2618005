42 patients with bacterial infections caused by resistant to other available in this country antibiotics, immunocompromised patients and patients in severe life-threatening conditions were treated with ciprofloxacin (Ciprobay--Bayer) in tablets. Before being admitted to the clinic most of the patients had been treated with various antibacterial drugs, including Tarivid--Hoechst (4 patients), in sufficient doses and duration. The drug was applied in doses of 250 mg or 500 mg twice daily according to the type, site, severity of the infection and the renal function state. The treatment continued for 5 up to 10 days. The results were judged by a three degree scale. In 37 patients (88.1%) the results were considered very good and in 5 patients (11.9%)--good. The side effects were insignificant. Ciprofloxacin emerges as a strong antibacterial drug with a very good therapeutic efficacy in patients with severe infections of the urinary tract and other organs.
