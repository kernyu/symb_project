The in-vitro activities of DuP 721 and DuP 105, new oxazolidinone antibacterials, were compared with those of cefazolin, cephalexin, ciprofloxacin, clindamycin, oxacillin, penicillin, and vancomycin against Gram-positive cocci. DuP 721 was approximately four-fold more active than DuP 105 with an MIC of 2.0 mg/l for 90% of the Staphylococcus aureus, beta-haemolytic streptococcus and Streptococcus faecalis strains tested, and an MIC of 4.0 mg/l for 90% of the Str. faecium, penicillin-resistant Str. pneumoniae and viridans streptococcus strains tested. DuP 105 was most active against strains of Staph. epidermidis with an MIC of 4.0 mg/l for 90% of the strains tested. There was no cross resistance between these and the other antibacterial agents that were tested. Both oxazolidinones had bacteriostatic activity in broth against susceptible organisms. Both DuP 721 and DuP 105 inhibited ribosomal protein synthesis in a cell-free system. These synthetic, orally absorbable compounds represent a new series of antibacterial agents unrelated by chemical structure to any other currently available antimicrobial agents.
