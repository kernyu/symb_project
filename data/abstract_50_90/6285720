The severity of herpetic keratitis induced by 9-(2-hydroxyethoxymethyl) guanine-resistant strains of herpes simplex virus was significantly reduced by cotherapy with 9-beta-D-arabinofuranosyladenine (ara-A) and 2-deoxycoformycin. Therapy with 5-trifluoromethyl-2'-deoxyuridine (F3TdR) significantly reduced the severity of keratitis induced by an acyclovir-resistant strain with a defective DNA polymerase. Therapy with 3 percent acyclovir ointment slightly reduced the number of herpetic lesions produced by either deoxypyrimidine kinase or DNA polymerase defective viruses, despite these viruses being 100 to 1000 times more resistant to acyclovir than the wildtype strain. Therapy with 3 percent ara-A ointment alone significantly reduced the severity of lesions produced by the wildtype herpes strain. Therapy with ara-A alone did not reduce the severity of disease induced by any of the acyclovir-resistant mutants. The sensitivity of the wildtype and mutant viruses to nucleoside analogs was confirmed by yield-reduction assays conducted with Vero cells. These studies indicate that cotherapy with ara-A and an adenosine deaminase inhibitor was a reasonable alternative therapy for keratitis due to mutants resistant to therapy with nucleoside analogs which require the virus-specified deoxypyrimidine kinase or DNA polymerase, while ara-A alone was not an effective alternative.
