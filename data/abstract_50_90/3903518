Bone marrow cells infected with retroviral vectors carrying the bacterial neomycin resistance (neo) gene as a marker were used for long-term reconstitution of the haematopoietic system of irradiated mice. The neo gene is expressed in the myeloid and lymphoid lineages of these animals and an analysis of the sites of viral integration indicates that these lineages are derived from the same primitive multipotent cells.
