Salmonella enteritidis accounted for 55% of the 27,478 salmonellae isolated from humans in England and Wales during 1988. Within this serotype phage type 24 has increased from 24 isolations in 1987 to 201 in 1988. The high frequency of drug resistance in this phage type has been shown to be due to the presence of plasmids belonging to Inc N and coding for resistance to a range of antimicrobial drugs among which resistance to ampicillin, streptomycin, tetracycline (AST) and T predominate. These plasmids are phage-type determining and convert strains of phage type 4 to phage type 24.
