During spore development of Bacillus subtilis both protein synthesis and sporulation become resistant to the antibiotic fusidic acid. This resistance develops at the time when asymmetric prespore septa are formed. Simultaneously ribosomes lose their ability to bind fusidic acid, as demonstrated by their affinity chromatography with the immobilized drug. Mutants resistant to fusidic acid during growth are oligosporogenous; their sporulation development is blocked before septum formation. These results indicate that normal ribosomes are needed for prespore septation sporulation; only after septation can protein synthesis be maintained, throughout the development period, by fusidate resistant ribosomes.
