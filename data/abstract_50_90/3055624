The authors discuss two areas of therapeutics employed commonly in office practice, namely, anti-infective therapy and therapy for disorders of micturition. In anti-infective therapy, the pharmacodynamic aspects of drug action, as exemplified by the in-vitro susceptibility of various pathogens to antibiotics, are often known before the drug is administered to the patient. Thus, therapeutic failures generally result from a lack of knowledge of the individual patient's pharmacokinetics. In contrast, drug therapy for disorders of micturition is directed against a variety of often conflicting mechanisms and is seldom based on any pharmacokinetic tenets.
