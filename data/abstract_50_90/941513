Puromycin was injected intraventricularly and cyclohexymid subcutaneously into rats with a hereditary predisposition to audiogenic epileptiform seizures. The injections inhibited the intensity of protein synthesis in the brain by 40 to 65%. Resistance to acoustic stimuli which appeared in 24% of the experimental animals did not correlate with the degree of protein synthesis inhibition in the brain.
