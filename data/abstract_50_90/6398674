Among 273 malarial patients recruited through passive detection, 177 in vivo tests were performed in Andekaleka and Ankazobe and 23 in vitro tests in Ifanadiana, and Ankazobe (inland of Madagascar). In vivo, chloroquine failed within 7 days at 10 mg/kg in 28/86 patients, at 25 mg/kg in 7/34 and amodiaquine failed in 5/55 with 10 mg/kg and in 0/14 with 25 mg/kg. In vitro, the semi-microtest revealed resistance to chloroquine of 1/23 isolates (IC50 = 750 nM/1) but high sensitivity to amodiaquine, dichlorquinazine and piperaquine of all studied isolates (max IC50 = 92 nM/1).
