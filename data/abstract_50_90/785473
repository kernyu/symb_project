A mutant haploid strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been isolated that is sensitive to the alkylating agent methyl methanesulfonate at a concentration of 0.01% (vol/vol). The strain also shows sensitivities to x-rays and ultra-violet light, which cosegregate with sensitivity to methyl methanesulfonate as a single gene defect. An analysis of the sensitivity to ultraviolet light indicates that the mutation interferes with the excision of pyrimidine dimers. Diploids homozygous for the mutant gene exhibit elevated frequencies of spontaneous mitotic recombination at the ade6 locus. The results indicate that all the events are due to gene conversion. Mitotic recombination was also found to be elevated for three loci other than ade6. Thus, the recombinational effect seems not to be locus specific. Linkage and allelism tests indicate that the mutation is an allele of the known radiation-sensitive gene rad18. The various effects of this new rad18 allele (rad18-3) are discussed in terms of a defect in DNA repair mechanisms.
