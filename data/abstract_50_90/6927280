A total of 18 strains of Mycobacterium fortuitum, 15 strains of M. chelonei, and 31 strains of M. chelonei-like organisms were tested by both broth microdilution and agar dilution to determine their susceptibility to 34 antimicrobial agents. All strains grew well enough in cation-supplemented Mueller-Hinton broth for endpoints to be read after 72 h of incubation. Some strains of M. chelonei did not grow on Mueller-Hinton agar. A few discrepancies were noted between the broth and agar procedures. For M. fortuitum, doxycycline, minocycline, amikacin, sulfamethoxazole, and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim were the most active agents. For M. chelonei, amikacin, sisomicin, tobramycin, and erythromycin were the most active agents. The M. chelonei-like organisms were most susceptible to ampicillin, doxycycline, minocycline, amikacin, erythromycin, sulfamethoxazole, and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim. Broth microdilution appears to be a reliable method for susceptibility testing of rapidly growing mycobacteria, although clinical studies are needed to determine how well in vitro results correlate with therapeutic in vivo outcome.
