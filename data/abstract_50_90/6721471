The susceptibility of 258 isolates of Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae from slaughtered pigs affected with chronic erysipelas in Japan to antimicrobial agents was determined. A total of 111 (43.0%) strains showed resistance to erythromycin, oleandomycin, oxytetracycline, or dihydrostreptomycin. Plasmids were not detected. This is the first report of resistance of E. rhusiopathiae to these antibiotics.
