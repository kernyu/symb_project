Isohematinic acid, an antibiotic newly isolated from the culture broth of Actinoplanes philippinensis SANK 61681, was assessed for its ability to enhance nonspecific resistance to bacterial infections against Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in mice. This agent, as well as BM 12,531 (Azimexon), was found to prolong the survival of normal mice infected with E. coli and also of compromised mice infected with either E. coli or P. aeruginosa, whose defense system had been deteriorated by treatment with carboquone, an alkylating agent. Like BM 12,531, isohematinic acid administered to normal mice significantly increased the nitroblue tetrazolium reducing potency of polymorphonuclear leucocytes (PMN), indicating that the microbicidal activity of PMN was enhanced by these agents. In addition, in the compromised mice these agents were able to restore the number of peripheral blood leucocytes, which had been reduced to about 30% of the normal level by carboquone. These results suggest that isohematinic acid, like BM 12,531, enhances nonspecific resistance to these bacterial infections by stimulating the microbicidal activity of PMN and inducing leucocytosis.
