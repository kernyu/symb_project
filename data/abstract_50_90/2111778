A novel plasmid of about 7.8 megadaltons (MDal) could be detected in a non-penicillinase-producing Neisseria gonorrhoeae strain isolated in Munich in 1987. As the strain showed no resistance against commonly used chemotherapeutic agents, at present the plasmid must be described as phenotypically "cryptic".
