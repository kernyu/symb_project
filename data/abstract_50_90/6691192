Antibiotics may be successful in the treatment of infections, but may also cause these because of their antibacterial activity. These infections are known as superinfections and are preceded by colonization with resistant micro-organisms. Broad-spectrum antibiotics enjoy a worse reputation in this regard than do narrow-spectrum antibiotics, which are preferable in therapeutic indications. Adequate diffusion to the focus of infection and effective local action are essential in obtaining satisfactory results. For this reason kennel cough should not be treated with systemic antibiotics, and the urinary pH should be taken into account in the treatment of urinary tract infections. In antibacterial prophylaxis in surgery, the risk of colonization can be reduced by limiting administration to 24 hours. Tissue levels should be adequate at the time of surgery, which implies that administration should be started prior to surgery.
