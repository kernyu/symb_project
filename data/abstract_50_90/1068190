Enterobacteria are more resistant to nalidixic acid than the majority of other Gram-negative organisms isolated from river water, so allowing their selection on MacConkey agar containing nalidixic aicd. Selection is further improved by anaerobic incubation which, with nalidixic acid, virtually eliminates oxidase-postivie strains such as Pseudomonas or Aeromonas.
