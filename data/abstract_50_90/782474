The clinical trial of the combination N1-(4,5-dimethyl-2-oxazolyl)-sulfanilamide (sulfamoxole) and 2,4-diamino-5-(3,4,5-trimethoxy-benzyl)-pyrimidine (trimethoprim) (CN 3123, Nevin, Supristol) showed that, when given in the ratio of 5:1 and in a suitable dosage computed from pharmacokinetic information, it exhibited antibacterial activity and had a therapeutic effect in about 90% of the patients. In view of the numerous types of pathogen identified in the clinical trial, CN 3123 can be described as a broad-spectrum chemotherapeutic agent. CN 3123 was also effective against infections caused by sulfonamide-resistant or antibiotic-resistant pathogens.
