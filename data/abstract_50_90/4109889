A naturally occurring R factor with constitutive pilus synthesis is described which resembles the sex factor F in compatibility and in restricting coliphage T7. Unlike F, it is not cured during growth with acridine orange. Results suggest that the R factor produces repressor of pilus synthesis, to which the operator is insensitive (i(+)o(c)). In this respect it differs from both the F factor (i(-)o(+)) and wild-type F-like R factors (i(+)o(+)).
