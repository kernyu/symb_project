A strain of Escherichia coli (NSW77) which is partially resistant to streptomycin was isolated by selecting for growth on plates supplemented with 12.5 micrograms/ml streptomycin, a concentration which completely inhibits growth of wild-type strains. The low-level resistance of the mutant appears to result from a reduced ability to accumulate streptomycin intracellularly. In addition, the mutant strain is unable to use succinate for growth because of a defective respiratory chain. Thus, membranes of the mutant strain were found to have approximately half the NADH and D-lactate oxidase activity of the parent strain. Moreover, membranes of the mutant were found to contain demethyl-menaquinone and, in place of ubiquinone, a structural analogue, 2-octaprenyl-3-methyl-6-methoxy-1,4 benzoquinone. The mutation responsible for both the Suc-phenotype and partial resistance to streptomycin was found to be located near minute 15 on the bacterial chromosome. Both the biochemical and genetic evidence suggests the the mutation in strain NSW77 resides in the ubi F gene. Another previously characterized ubi F strain was also found to have a reduced capacity to take up an aminoglycoside antibiotic (gentamicin). These results suggest that the respiratory defects in ubi F strains are responsible for the reduced capacity of such strains to accumulate aminoglycosides.
