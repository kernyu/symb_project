Some properties of hospital staphylococcal strains isolated from the patients with purulent postnatal mastitis were studied. It was found that all the strains of the phage type 80.81 widely distributed in the obstetric hospitals were polylysogenic and polyresistant to antibiotics. The resistance markers in most of the isolates were located on the plasmids. Elimination of the plasmids carrying the antibiotics resistance markers resulted in a simultaneous change in the strain lysogenic spectrum while the phage type and fermentative properties, such as production of plasmocoagulase, DNAase and lecithinase did not change. The capacity for hemotoxin production was lost simultaneously with antibiotic resistance in 1 out of 17 cultures tested.
