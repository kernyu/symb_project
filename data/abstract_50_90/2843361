A gyrB gene from Streptomyces sphaeroides, a producer of novobiocin, has been cloned in Streptomyces lividans, where it conferred resistance to novobiocin. The Streptomyces gyrB gene was sufficiently similar to a Bacillus subtilis gyrB probe to be specifically recognized during Southern analysis. Partial purification of DNA gyrase by affinity chromatography revealed the presence of two such activities (differing in their responses to novobiocin) in the clone. The product of the cloned gene, a novobiocin-resistant DNA gyrase B subunit, was identified in vitro by coupled transcription--translation as a 79-kd protein.
