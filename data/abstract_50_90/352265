Combinations of certain antibiotics and normal human serum at concentrations at which there was no killing by the agents when used alone were found to be bactericidal for Escherichia coli K-12 cells. This effect was observed with tetracycline, streptomycin (SM), trimethoprim, and ampicillin, but not with chloramphenicol or nalidixic acid. Synergy between SM and human serum was also observed against four of nine smooth strains of E. coli. A plasmid-bearing strain of E. coli K-12 was also killed by combinations of tetracycline or SM plus serum, even though the plasmid conferred resistance to tetracycline and SM. Evidence is presented that the synergy between antibiotics and serum is due to a complement-mediated effect on the bacterial cells that makes the cells more susceptible to the bactericidal effects of the antibiotics.
