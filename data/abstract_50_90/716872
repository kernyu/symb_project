Thirty-six cases of empyema were diagnosed in children over a two year period, giving an overall incidence of 0.11% of the total hospital admissions. Many of them had measles bronchopneumonia and most were malnourished. 16 children had penicillin resistant staphylococcal infection. 29 of them were treated with closed tube drainage. Thirteen died during the course of treatment, the majority within three days of admission. The rest were followed up over a period of up to six months and showed good recovery. Six of these patients developed pneumothorax during the course of treatment. Various combinations of Ampicillin, Cloxacillin, Gentamycin and Cotrimoxazole parenterally were used. Supportive treatment with blood transfusion was found to be beneficial.
