A prolonged outbreak (December 1980 to July 1982) of nosocomial urinary tract infections appeared to be due to strains of Serratia marcescens that were resistant to currently available antibiotics. The serotyping and antibiotic susceptibility patterns suggested a few endemic strains of serotypes O13, O2/3, O12/14, and nontypable strains. These strains were isolated from the urine samples of inpatients with urinary tract infections in the urology ward and in other wards. The strains of O12/14 (gentamicin susceptible) were replaced with those of O2/3 (gentamicin resistant) between June and September 1981, whereas the other serotypes were isolated continuously. They were resistant to sulbenicillin, cefmetazole, gentamicin, and amikacin, and susceptible to micronomicin and of loxacin, a new quinolone antibiotic. Most of them were also resistant to the disinfectant chlorhexidine, which had been used widely for hand washing in the hospital.
