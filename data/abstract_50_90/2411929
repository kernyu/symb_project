In the isolated bullfrog cornea, three calcium channel antagonists had dose-dependent inhibitory effects on the Cl-originated short-circuit current (SCC). Their order of decreasing potency was bepridil, verapamil and diltiazem. One millimolar diltiazem inhibited the SCC by 98% and subsequent incubation with the calcium ionophore A23187 had no restorative effect. Increasing the bathing solution Ca concentration from 0.05 to 15 mM, however, decreased diltiazem's inhibitory efficacy. This antagonist depolarized the intracellular potential difference Vsc from -54 to -18 mV (tear:reference) and the voltage divider ratio FRo decreased from 0.58 to 0.30, suggesting an increase in basolateral membrane electrical resistance. Additional indication of a basolateral membrane effect by the drug was that preincubation with 10(-5) M amphotericin B in Cl-free Ringer's did not eliminate the inhibitory effect of the drug on the Na- and K-elicited SCC. In the absence of amphotericin B in Cl-free Ringer's (SCC = 0), 1 X 10(-3) M diltiazem depolarized the Vsc from -78 to -9 mV suggesting that the increase in basolateral membrane resistance was due to K channel blockade. Diltiazem (1 X 10(-3) M) significantly decreased cyclic AMP content; however, isoproterenol in the presence of the drug increased cyclic AMP fourfold without having any restorative effect on the inhibited SCC. Therefore, the inhibition of the Cl-originated SCC resulting from an increase in basolateral membrane K resistance is not caused by a decline in cyclic AMP content.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
