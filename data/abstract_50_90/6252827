Incorporation of transposone Tnl of ampicillin resistance into the chromosome of E. coli C600 resulted in formation of at least 8 types of auxotrophic mutants. The transposone incorporates mainly into the loci the damage of which induces proline deficit (20 per cent). The sites of incorporation of transposone Tnl in the chromosomes of E. coli C600 and E. coli JC411 did not coincide.
