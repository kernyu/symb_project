Bac. subtilis 168 (BD-25) cells were infected with DNA of plasmide R1drd19 isolated from E. coli strain; transformants resistant to streptomycin (500 microgram/ml) and kanamycin (40 microgram/ml) appeared with the frequency of 2.10(-6). These transformants retained resistance to the mentioned antibiotics stably. A satellite DNA peak was revealed in centrifugation in the density gradient of cesium chloride with ethidium bromide. It was possible to infect cells of Bac. subtilis 168 (BD-25) with plasmide DNA isolated from the transformants. Plasmide transduction with the aid of phages AR9 and PBSI multiplied on the transformant strains was also effected. Physico-chemical analysis of the transformed plasmide DNA was conducted; its molecular weight was determined.
