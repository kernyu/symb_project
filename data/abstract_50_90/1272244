Fourteen unlinked sin genes could be mutated to recessive antisuppressor alleles preventing the expression of suppressors in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. cyh1 alleles, resistant to the ribosomal inhibitor cycloheximide, also have some antisuppressor effect. The genetical and physiological characterization of these mutants is consistent with the hypothesis that they affect components of the messenger RNA translation machinery such as tRNA modifying enzymes or ribosomal proteins.
