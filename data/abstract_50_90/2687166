One hundred and fifty clinical isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae were studied for beta lactamase production, Klebocin production and resistance to antibiotics and metals. 97.3 and 82.7 per cent strains produced beta-lactamase and klebocin respectively. Resistance to arsenite, antimony, tellurite, mercury and silver was observed in 91,66,6, 47.7, 44.8 and 33.3 per cent respectively and to ampicillin, tetracycline and nalidixic acid in 93.3,60, 41.3, 34.4, 28.2, and 1.3 per cent respectively. Forty eight antibiotic and metal resistant strains were then conjugated with Escherichia coli 711 F-Lac-Nxr. Transferable drug resistance, metal ion resistance, beta lactamase production, klebocin production and lactose fermentation was seen in 30, 21, 10, 11 and 5 isolates respectively.
