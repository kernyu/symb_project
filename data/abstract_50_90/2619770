Pregnenolone-16 alpha-carbonitrile, spironolactone, tocopherol acetate and ethanol were tested for their effect on lipid peroxidation using microsomal membranes or linoleic acid as substrates and Fe++/ascorbate or Fe++ as electron sources. The steroids had no effect on lipid peroxidation, tocopherol and ethanol presented potent and mild antioxidant activity, respectively. Pregnenolone-16 alpha-carbonitrile, spironolactone, ethanol and tocopherol acetate were examined for the effects on the body's response to drugs. It was found that the former three agents increased the resistance to zoxazolamine, hexobarbital and chlorzoxazone and tocopherol acetate increased only that against chlorzoxazone. The test compounds were examined for their effect on the in vivo reduction of p-nitrobenzoate and the in vitro metabolism of zoxazolamine, hexobarbital, ethylmorphine and procaine. The two steroids and ethanol enhanced the metabolism almost in all cases, while tocopherol acetate increased only ethylmorphine N-demethylation very significantly.
