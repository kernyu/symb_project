In bacterial cells near-ultraviolet radiation (NUV) generates H2O2 which can be decomposed by endogenous catalase to H2O and O2. To assess the roles of H2O2 and catalase in NUV lethality, we manipulated the amount of intracellular catalase (a) by the use of mutant and plasmid strains with altered endogenous catalase, (b) physiologically, by the addition of glucose, and (c) by induction of catalase synthesis with oxidizing agents. Not only was there no direct correlation between NUV-resistance and catalase activity, but in some cases the correlation was inverse. Also, while there was correlation between NUV and H2O2 sensitivity for most strains tested, there were a number of exceptions which indicates that the modes of killing were different for the two agents.
