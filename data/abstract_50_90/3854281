Antibiotic therapy, using penicillins or cephalosporins, is frequently required in patients on maintenance hemodialysis. Points to consider are dose adjustment for drugs which are excreted via the kidney, drug dialysability, and cumulation with frequent occurrence of side reactions, neurotoxicity and bleeding being the clinically most important ones. For third-generation cephalosporins with N-methylthiotetrazole side chain, impaired intrahepatic vitamin K metabolism may cause problems of hemostasis which can be avoided by dose adjustment and prophylactic administration of vitamin K1.
