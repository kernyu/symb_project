Clinical studies of sultamicillin (SBTPC) fine granules, an oral antibiotic with ester linked ampicillin and beta-lactamase inhibitor, sulbactam, were performed in acute uncomplicated cystitis and complicated urinary tract infections. 1. SBTPC fine granules were administrated at a dose of 187.5 mg 2-3 times daily for 5-7 days to 6 patients with acute uncomplicated cystitis. Clinical efficacies as judged according to the criteria of the UTI Committee were excellent in 5 cases and moderate in 1 case with an effectiveness rate of 100%. All of 7 identified bacteria were eradicated by the treatment. 2. SBTPC fine granules were administrated at a dose of 187.5 mg or 375 mg 3 times daily for 5-7 days to 17 patients with complicated urinary tract infections. Clinical efficacies as judged according to the criteria of the UTI Committee were excellent in 8 cases, moderate in 4 cases and poor in 5 cases with an effectiveness rate of 70.6%. Out of 17 identified bacteria, 14 (82.4%) were eradicated by the treatment. 3. As adverse reactions, glossitis, diarrhea and pharyngeal redness were observed in 1 case out of 31 cases treated with the drug. These symptoms, however, were mild and transient. No abnormal laboratory test values were observed. From the above results, it appears that SBTPC fine granules are useful in the treatment of urinary tract infections.
