Isolates of Streptococcus faecalis are moderately susceptible to quinolones, penicillins and aminoglycosides used alone. Penicillin-aminoglycosides synergism is not observed against aminoglycosides high-level resistant strains. The combination of an aminoglycoside plus a quinolone was synergistic against susceptible strains of S. faecalis but not against aminoglycosides high-level resistant strains. No antagonistic effect of quinolones plus aminoglycosides or plus penicillin was observed.
