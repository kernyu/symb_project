Puromycin aminonucleoside (PAN) increased significantly the mutation rate of Escherichia coli B/r strains when used in conjunction with certain ultraviolet dosages. PAN (2.5 mM) when added to the post-irradiation medium of hcr+ cells slowed down RNA synthesis to 65%, protein to 76% and DNA to 48% of the control rate. Purine ribosides such as adenosine decreased the inhibitory action of PAN on DNA, RNA and protein synthesis. Quantitatively quite different results were obtained with the hcr- strains. PAN did not increase killing of UV, but decreased the frequency of UV-induced mutations. Antimutagenic purine ribosides decreased the synergistic mutagenic activity of PAN. Increases in DNA synthesis in the presence of antimutagens correspond to reductions in the rate of mutation to streptomycin resistance. The excision of UV-induced pyrimidine dimers was investigated in the presence and absence of PAN. The pattern of repair-inhibition reversion of pre-mutagenic lesions by adenosine suggests that PAN behaves as a feedback inhibitor of purine biosynthesis in UV-irradiated cells. It is probable that this inhibition results in an impairment of repair which produces the increase in mutant numbers.
