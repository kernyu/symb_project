The authors investigated the effect of the immunostimulant levamisole on the immunological reactivity of schizophrenics and the resultant decrease in the therapeutic resistance of these patients toward psychotropic therapy. Thirteen patients with juvenile malignant continuously progressive schizophrenia were studied, using a double blind design of examination. The number of suppressor T-cells in patients treated with levamisole increased from 16.6% to 22.8% (p less than 0.001) which was not observed in patients on placebo. It has been demonstrated that the immunological parameters in patients with juvenile malignant continually progressive schizophrenia can be fully recovered. Yet, the changes observed in the clinical picture were heterogeneous and unremarkable. The experimental findings suggest that the use of levamisole may be more effective in patients with less progressive forms of the disease.
