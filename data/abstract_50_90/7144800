Tunicamycin is an antibiotic that inhibits the oligosaccharide synthesis of glycoproteins. It greatly suppressed the growth of cultured mouse mammary carcinoma FM3A cells, when added to growth medium at concentrations of more than 0.1 microgram/ml. We have developed a single-step selection system for quantitatively detecting mutations resistant to the antibiotic in FM3A cells. Mutant colonies resistant to 1-1.2 micrograms tunicamycin per ml (the optimal concentration of the selecting agent) appeared at a frequency of 10(-4) to 10(-5) in an unmutagenized population, but they increased over 50-fold in the population mutagenized with 0.5 microgram N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) per ml for 2 h and selected under optimal conditions for the time of mutation expression and cell density in selective medium. Fluctuation analysis, by the method of Luria and Delbruck, revealed that tunicamycin-resistant mutations occurred at random during proliferation in normal medium at a rate of 1.2 x 10(-6) per cell per generation. So far 45 spontaneous and MNNG-induced mutant lines have been isolated and serially passaged in the absence of tunicamycin. These mutant lines all inherited their resistance for more than 60 generations. The mutants examined in detail were 12- to 26-fold more resistant than wild-type cells in terms of the D10 value, the concentration of tunicamycin reducing the plating efficiency to 10% of the control. In the hybrids between wild-type and mutant cells the tunicamycin resistance behaved in a co-dominant manner. Tunicamycin inhibited the incorporation of [3H]mannose into the acid-insoluble cell fraction; in this respect, mutant cells were over 30-fold more resistant than wild-type cells. Possible mechanisms of tunicamycin resistance are discussed.
