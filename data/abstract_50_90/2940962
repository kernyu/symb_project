Sensitivity of 50 Candida fungus strains isolated from patients with chronic intestine diseases was studied with respect to amphotericin B, levorin, enteroseptol, intestopan and decamethoxin. The rate of forming resistant variants of the strains with respect to decamethoxin and development of their cross resistance to levorin was estimated. It was shown that decamethoxin was the most active antifungal drug among the drugs tested. Estimation of sensitivity of the Candida strains to enteroseptol and intestopan revealed that the fungicidal concentration of enteroseptol for 78 per cent of the strains ranged within 3.9-7.8 micrograms/ml. It was demonstrated that development of resistance to decamethoxin in the strains of Candida albicans was slow and did not reach high levels. No cross resistance between decamethoxin and levorin was detected.
