In this study, 64% of the 197 strains of Aeromonas isolated from different stages of aquatic environment (surface water, sewage...) were resistant to one or two antibiotics, and 20% to four or more antibiotics. These multiresistant strains were only isolated from sewage and their resistances were transferable by conjugation to different species of Gram-negative bacilli. The incidence of these results is discussed.
