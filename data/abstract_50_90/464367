The therapeutic efficacy of a 0.5% cuprimyxin plus 1% hydrocortisone acetate-water-base suspension was evaluated in 130 clinical cases of otitis externa in dogs and cats in various geographic areas of the United States. The otic microbial flora was studied before treatment in 125 (96%) of the dogs and cats, with multiple isolates recovered from mated from 70%, yeasts from 65%, and fungi from 5% of the animals. Evens though multiple drug reistance was frequently observed in the bacterial flora, all bacteria and yeast isolates were sensitive to cuprimyxin. Of the 130 treated animals, a statistically significant (P less than 0.01) favorable response was obtained in 84,6% and no response in 13;1%; in2.3%, the condition became worse. An adverse reaction (pain at the time of first application) was observed in 1 (0.8%) animal.
