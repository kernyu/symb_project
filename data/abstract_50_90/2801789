Rifampin has been noted to exhibit exceptional antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus epidermidis biofilms as compared to commonly used antibiotics. To further explore this unique effect of rifampin, we evaluated the antimicrobial activity of three commercially available preparations of rifampin, two rifampin analogs (CGP29861 and rifapentine) and the parent compound rifamycin SV. These were tested against standardized S. epidermidis biofilms in various milieus. All six members of the rifamycin group tested demonstrated marked antimicrobial activity but with minor foci of resisters when tested in a peptone water environment. The microscopy of the exposed biofilms showed profound lysis and morphological distortion of the remaining cells. The synergistic elimination of the foci of resistance was achieved in an environment of fresh peritoneal dialysis (PD) solution or by the addition of vancomycin. Neither vancomycin nor fresh PD solution demonstrated significant antimicrobial activity when tested alone with biofilm preparations. Spent PD fluid markedly antagonized the activity of the rifamycins with the exception of the rifampin analogs, an effect primarily of pH. The synergistic effect of vancomycin with the rifamycins was not affected either by protein content or pH, leaving the antagonistic properties of spent PD fluid unexplained. The variable activity of the different members of the rifamycin group underlines the importance of structural differences in determining their interaction with bacterial biofilms. Further precision of the nature of these structural interactions is seen to have considerable potential for therapeutic advancement of catheter-associated sepsis.
