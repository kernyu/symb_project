CM 6606 differs in its mode of action from chloroquine but studies on its activity against parasites resistant to other antimalarials suggest that it may have some features in common with aminoalcohols. Similarities in drug-induced pigment changes are especially striking. Only halofantrine shows a reduced activity, however, against parasites that are highly resistant to CM 6606, while such parasites are slightly hypersensitive to sulfadoxine and clindamycin. Evidence suggesting that CM 6606 may function through an active metabolite, possibly CM 6609 in which the N-oxide is reduced, is discussed.
