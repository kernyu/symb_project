Ampicillin administered to rabbits (20 mg/kg per day) over a period of three days subsequently provoked a death rate of 40%. No deaths were observed after treatment with gentamycin (10 mg/kg per day) or with a combination of ampicillin and gentamycin. On the fourth day weight loss in the three treated groups was 12%, 11% and 9%, respectively, compared to controls. At the same time food intake in the treated groups was only 15% to 20% of the amount consumed by controls. In the caecum, ampicillin treatment resulted in dominance of a strain of Enterobacter aerogenes. Gentamycin had no effect on bacterial flora, although in combination with ampicillin, the number of caecal bacteria (aerobic and anaerobic) was reduced. Flora modification might be responsible for accumulation of NH3 and an unbalance of free acids. Caecotrophy was inhibited by administration of ampicillin. When administered intramuscularly, ampicillin produced results comparable with those obtained orally, although gentamycin was ineffective.
