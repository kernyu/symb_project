The anthelmintic efficacy of albendazole (methyl [5-(propylthio) - 1H - benzimidazole -2 -yl] carbamate) against immature and adult Fasciola hepatica and against standardised strains of benzimidazole resistant Haemonchus contortus and Trichostrongylus colubriformis was evaluated in experimentally infected sheep. A single intrarumenal treatment of dose rates of 3.8 and 7.6 mg/kg was ineffective against immature (six weeks old) F hepatica. Dose rates of 5.7 and 7.6 mg/kg reduced the number of mature (12 weeks old) F hepatica by 70 and 91 per cent respectively. Dose rates of 5.7 and 7.6 mg/kg removed 92 and 99 per cent of four-week-old, benzimidazole resistant H contortus and 89 and 99 per cent of four-week-old, benzimidazole resistant T colubriformis.
