We have constructed a series of plasmids with unique PstI restriction sites within or near the pre-penicillinase signal sequence for protein secretion. To do this, we devised a rapid, simple method to eliminate undesirable unique restriction sites within plasmids while maintaining antibiotic resistance. We thus obtained a plasmid with a conveniently located, unique HincII site in the penicillinase gene of plasmid pBR322 which was used to generate, with BAL 31 exonuclease, deletions extending into the region encoding the signal sequence. DNA inserted into these plasmids can be translated in all three reading frames both including signal sequence, or starting immediately beyond it.
