The authors report one case of psittacosis with acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute tubulo-interstitial nephropathy and jaundice. Erythromycin therapy was uneffective but recovery was obtained with minocycline and rifampicin treatment. Early diagnosis of Chlamydia psittaci infection is mandatory in order to prevent severe complications and to institute appropriate antimicrobial therapy.
