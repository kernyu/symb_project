A nonfermentative, gram-negative bacillus, resembling Center for Disease Control group IVe, was isolated from the blood of a patient with obstructive uropathy. Prior studies implicating this organism in septicemia could not be found in the literature. It is suggested that this is the first time that this bacillus has been reported to cause bacillemia in humans.
