Polyploid strains of Candida scottii differ by their susceptibility to the action of nistatin. Haploid strain is most resistant, diploid strain is less resistant than haploid strain, and triploid strain is more susceptible than diploid strain. UV-treatment resulted in mutants which were 1.5--2 times more resistant to the action of nistatin than parent forms. The frequency of nistatin-resistant mutants increases with the ploidity of the cultures and with the doses of UV-irradiation.
