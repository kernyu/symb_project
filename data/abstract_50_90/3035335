Tn1545, from Streptococcus pneumoniae BM4200, confers resistance to kanamycin (aphA-3), erythromycin (ermAM) and tetracycline (tetM). The 25.3 kb element is self-transferable to various Gram-positive bacterial genera where it transposes. Tn1545 was cloned in its entirety in the recombination deficient Escherichia coli HB101 where it was unstable. The three resistance genes aphA-3, ermAM and tetM were expressed but were not transferable to other E. coli cells. Tn1545 transposed from the hybrid plasmid to multiple sites of the chromosome of its new host. The element re-transposed, at a frequency of 5 X 10(-9), from the chromosome to various sites of a conjugative plasmid where it could be lost by apparently clean excision. The element transformed and transposed to the chromosome of Bacillus subtilis. The properties of the conjugative shuttle transposon Tn1545 may account for the recent emergence of genes from Gram-positive bacteria in Gram-negative organisms.
