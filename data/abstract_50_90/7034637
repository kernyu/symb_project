The results of the crosses between Salmonella and Escherichia 0151C are presented. Transmissive determinants resistant to ampicillin, dentamicin, kanamycin, neomycin, monomycin, streptomycin, morphocyclin, tetracycline and chloramphenicol were detected. It was shown that almost 50 per cent of Escherichia 0151K except the transmissive R factors were able to transferring the colicinogenic determinants.
