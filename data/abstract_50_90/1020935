A total of 206 strains of various staphylococcal species isolated from various sources were studied with respect to their sensitivity to 18 antibiotics. The number of strains poly-resistant to the antibiotics was almost the same among Staph. aureus and Staph. epidermidis, i. e. 54.8 and 51.3 per cent respectively. The coagulase-negative and mannitol-negative variants of Staph. aureus and Staph. epidermidis possessing high biological activity (10-14 properties) were resistant to more antibiotics as compared to the low active strains.
