In attempting to define the role of ribosomes in the mechanism of streptomycin dependence, a new phenomenon has been discovered. Analysis of this phenomenon-called phenotypic masking-leads to the conclusion that "streptomycin dependent" mutants are actually "drug dependent" because their dependence is equally satisfied by several drugs. These drugs, some of which are totally unrelated chemically, act on the ribosome and induce misreading in vitro and suppression in vivo.
