A mutant of Escherichia coli (sof) which was previously shown to have increased recombination frequency, to produce abnormally short "Okazaki fragments," and to be deficient in deoxyuridine triphosphatase has now been found also to possess mutator activity for several genes; point mutation rates and deletion rates are affected. The mutational stimulation effects are consistent with the hypothesis that incorporation of uracil into DNA is directly or indirectly responsible for the observed mutator activity.
