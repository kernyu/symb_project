The antimicrobial susceptibilities of 75 Aeromonas isolates were determined by agar dilution. Differences in resistance patterns were observed between strains isolated from different geographic locations and between A. sobria and A. hydrophila isolates. Multiple resistance was common; however, only one conjugative plasmid was detected. This 110-megadalton plasmid mediated resistance to eight antibiotics.
