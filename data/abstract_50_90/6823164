Despite their toxicity, the aminoglycosides remain useful and are often the first choice in the treatment of serious infections due to gram-negative bacilli. Nephrotoxicity has restricted the indications for neomycin to topical and oral use. Emergence of resistant organisms has limited the use of streptomycin to a few specific conditions. Gentamicin, tobramycin, and amikacin are effective against a broad spectrum of gram-negative bacilli including Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Amikacin is the aminoglycoside of choice when gentamicin resistance is prevalent.
