A rapid bioassay for gentamicin levels in serum was developed by using a strain of Klebsiella pneumoniae that has multiple resistance to antibiotics. Assays were comparable when performed on either small or large petri plates, and results were available in 2 to 4 h. Studies showed an overall recovery of 97.6% for gentamicin alone or 104.5% in the presence of commonly used antibiotics. The procedure can be performed without the need to inactivate other antibiotics that may be present in the serum sample.
