Morganocin 174 is coded by a plasmid, Mor174. The plasmid is not self-transmissible but may be mobilized by resistance factor R772. Morganocin synthesis in all Proteus and Providencia strains carrying Mor174 was characterized by a longer lag period after induction and higher titers than in Escherichia coli B(Mor174). The low titers obtained in E. coli B(Mor174) are due to a heatstable inhibitor produced by this strain. Synthesis of morganocin is not constitutive and may be induced by ultraviolet irradiation or mitomycin C. Morganocin production is not influenced by the growth medium of the organism.
