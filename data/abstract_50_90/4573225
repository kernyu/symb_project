Yeast strains were constructed carrying multiple mitochondrial markers conferring resistance to the inhibitors erythromycin, chloramphenicol, paromomycin and oligomycin. A pedigree analysis of two crosses was made by micromanipulating buds from zygotes. The first few daughter buds isolated from the zygotes sometimes gave rise to diploid clones which had a mixture of mitochondrial types. All possible classes of mitochondrial parental and recombinant types were found although they never appeared all together as the progeny from a single zygote. It was inferred that multiple recombination events took place in zygotes and in some of the buds derived from them. After removal of the first four or so daughter buds, subsequent buds from the zygote carried one mitochondrial type only. In cross I in which three markers were analyzed this was most frequently one of the parental types. In cross II (involving four mitochondrial markers) the later buds from the zygotes were frequently of recombinant mitochondrial type.
