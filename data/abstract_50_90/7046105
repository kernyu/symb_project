A case of Plasmodium falciparum malaria resistant to chloroquine occurring in a patient taking Fansidar (a combination of pyrimethamine and sulphadoxine) regularly as prophylaxis is reported. It seems likely that the malaria infection was acquired in Tanzania. It is probable that more such cases will be seen, and complacency regarding the emergence of drug-resistant P. falciparum malaria should be guarded against. It is predicted that chloroquine and Fansidar resistance will be increasingly found in a wider area of Africa, including South Africa. A brief review of drug-resistant P. falciparum malaria is presented and alternative therapy discussed.
