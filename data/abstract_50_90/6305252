240 and 183 strains of non-PPNG and PPNG isolated in 1981 were studied for their susceptibility to ceftriaxone and cefotaxime respectively. All the strains were susceptible to 0.016 microgram/ml of either antibiotic. PPNG from males were less susceptible to cefotaxime than non-PPNG or PPNG from females. PPNG isolated in 1979 were less susceptible to gentamicin than non-PPNG. The relatively high MIC values of cotrimoxazole may account for the high treatment failure rate encountered with the drug.
