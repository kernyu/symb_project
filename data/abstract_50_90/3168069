The authors have evaluated the behavior of the interaction between cefotetan, a new cephalosporin with long acting resistance to the action of beta-lactamases, and gentamicin, amikacin and netilmicin against methicillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococci. In 65.8% of the cases, drug combinations showed synergic effects. Results were subdivided for susceptibility or resistance to the drugs used in combination. In general, when both drugs were tested against methicillin-susceptible strains the results showed synergism.
