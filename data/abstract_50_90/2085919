The incidence of imported malaria is increasing in France, in relation to the increasing frequency of travel to tropical areas and the extension of chemoresistant strains of Plasmodium falciparum throughout the world. Worsening morbidity and mortality due to this parasite in the last 5 years is having an impact in socioeconomic terms; this is all the more prejudicial in that a young healthy population is concerned. Traditional chemoprophylaxis is at present insufficient for adequately controlling this recrudescence. Both the public and general practitioners should be made more aware of the measures to be taken during, and especially after foreign travel, in order to reverse the present tendency concerning imported malaria, and to improve travellers' protection.
