Under the effect of human leukocytic alpha-interferon-II for injections there was observed an increase in sensitivity of bacteria to benzylpenicillin, ristomycin, novobiocin, streptomycin, kanamycin, monomycin and erythromycin. A higher antibacterial effect of the penicillin and erythromycin was recorded only with respect to initially resistant strains of staphylococci. For the antibiotic resistant strains of staphylococci the MICs of the penicillin and erythromycin decreased on the average 17.8 and 208 times (p less than 0.001) respectively. The interferon had no effect on sensitivity of bacteria to chloramphenicol.
