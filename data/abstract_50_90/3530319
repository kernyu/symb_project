Crystalline R67 dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) is a dimeric molecule with two identical 78 amino acid subunits, each folded into a beta-barrel conformation. The outer surfaces of the three longest beta strands in each protomer together form a third beta barrel having six strands at the subunit interface. A unique feature of the enzyme structure is that while the intersubunit beta barrel is quite regular over most of its surface, an 8-A "gap" runs the full length of the barrel, disrupting potential hydrogen bonds between beta-strand D in subunit I and the adjacent corresponding strand of subunit II. It is proposed that this deep groove is the NADPH binding site and that the association between protein and cofactor is modulated by hydrogen-bonding interactions along one face of this antiparallel beta-barrel structure. A hypothetical model is proposed for the R67 DHFR-NADPH-folate ternary complex that is consistent with both the known reaction stereoselectivity and the weak binding of 2,4-diamino inhibitors to the plasmid-specified reductase. Geometrical comparison of this model with an experimentally determined structure for chicken DHFR suggests that chromosomal and type II R-plasmid specified enzymes may have independently evolved similar catalytic machinery for substrate reduction.
