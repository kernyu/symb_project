The combination of subinhibitory concentrations of trimethoprim (Tp) and nitrofurantoin (NT) seemed additively inhibitory against sensitive Escherichia coli K12, chromosomally mediated NT, R-plasmid mediated Tp and NT-resistant E. coli strains, respectively. The minimal inhibitory concentrations of 6 micrograms/NT/ml and 2 micrograms Tp/ml against the sensitive strain were respectively reduced 5-fold by a minimum inhibitory combination of Tp + NT. The 30-fold chromosomally mediated and 15-fold R-plasmid NT resistance were 3- and 5-fold respectively reduced by a minimum inhibitory combination of Tp + NT. The minimum inhibitory combination of Tp + NT also reduced more than 20-fold the at least 1,000-fold resistance level of the R-plasmid mediated Tp resistance. This in vitro activity of NT and Tp could be of clinical relevance in the therapy of urinary tract infections due to multiple antibiotic-resistant strains.
