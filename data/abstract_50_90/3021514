In 106 clinical isolates of multiresistant Klebsiella pneumoniae strains, we found that aminoglycoside-resistance was due mostly to two adenylating enzymes: AAD (2") (56.6%), that modifies gentamicin, kanamycin, tobramycin and sissomicin, and AAD (3") 9 (56.6% + 19.8%) that modifies streptomycin and spectinomycin. The identification of these enzymes was possible by MICs determination against a set of aminoglycosides antibiotics. AAD (2") + AAD (3")9 were coded by conjugative plasmid of about 120 Md.
