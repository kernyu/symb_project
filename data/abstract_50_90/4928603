Raw sewage was examined for the incidence of antibiotic-resistant coliforms present among both total and fecal coliforms. In both groups, it was found that approximately 3% of the coliform bacteria were resistant to two or more antibiotics. Of these organisms, 48% were capable of transferring all or part of their antibiotic resistance to an antibiotic-sensitive, F(-), derivative of Escherichia coli K-12. Among the R factors identified, those conferring resistance to streptomycin-tetracycline, ampicillin-streptomycin-tetracycline, and ampicillin or ampicillin-streptomycin accounted for 23, 20, and 15%, respectively, of the total R factors detected. The data indicate a significant level of infectious drug resistance among the fecal coliforms of the urban population. The data indicate further that because of the high incidence of coliform bacteria found to be doubly resistant to streptomycin and tetracyline, the inclusion of these antibiotics in selective media used for routine total or fecal coliform counts may serve to identify domestic sources of pollution.
