A comparative search was made for healthy carriers of pathogenic staphylococcus among the kitchen, canteen and scullery staff of the Malpighi Hospital and the paramedical personnel of its geriatrics, out-patient and nephrology sections. The following percentages of healthy carriers were observed: out-patient section 37.5%, nephrodialysis section 23%, kitchen 17.9%, and geriatrics section 14.2%. All staphylococcus strains were tested for their sensitivity to antibiotics. 25% were resistant to ampicillin, 21.8% to penicillin, and 21.8% to streptomycin.
