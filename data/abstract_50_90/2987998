A recombinant plasmid with wide-host-range transfer functions, narrow-host-range replication functions, and carrying a kanamycin-resistant transposon transferred kanamycin resistance to a number of plant-associated pseudomonads. Southern hybridization studies suggest that only a small portion of the plasmid, coinciding with the location of the transposon, is present in the kanamycin-resistant Pseudomonas derivatives. The plasmid sequences appear to be inserted at a number of different sites in the recipient genome. This plasmid can thus be used as a vehicle for the introduction of transposons into some plant-associated pseudomonads and should be useful in both genetic and ecological studies of these bacteria.
