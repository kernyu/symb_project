A controlled study was undertaken to determine the incidence of Group A haemolytic streptococci and other bacterial pathogens in throat swabs from patients presenting with sore throats. The isolation rate (38-8%) of Group A haemolytic streptococci from patients with acute tonsillitis was significantly higher than the isolation rate (8-9%) in a control group, but there was no significant difference in the isolation rates in patients diagnosed as having acute pharyngitis compared with the control group. There was no difference in the isolation rates of the other bacterial pathogens in the patient and control groups. In-vitro antibiotic studies were performed, and a comparison was made of the results of these tests and the treatment prescribed.
