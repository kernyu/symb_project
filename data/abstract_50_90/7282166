Under defined conditions the corrosive effect of several disinfectants (hydrogen peroxide, peracetic acid, formaldehyde, beta-propiolactone, Wofasteril, Lysoformin and Tegodor 73) was investigated with different metals and synthetic products after repeated aerosolation. At 6 plastics no alterations of their surface quality, their tensile strength and their compression resistance were observed. The strongest corrosive effect was produced by hydrogen peroxide and peracetic acid resp. the commercial preparation Wofasteril. Two aldehyde-containing disinfectants caused little changes of the colour coat of silver, brass, titanium and zinc, steel showed strong alterations; the effect of formaldehyde was very similar. The repeated disinfection with beta-propiolactone produced little colour changes on the surface of brass, titanium and zinc, on steel a strong corrosion was observed. In a control test without disinfectants colour changes of metal surfaces and strong damage of steel was produced by a high humidity. These results and the practical applicability are discussed.
