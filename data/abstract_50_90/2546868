The objective of this study was to elucidate the possible cause of increased oxidative stress observed in the adult housefly during aging. The hypothesis that increased production of oxygen radicals may be a cause of the increased oxidative stress was tested by comparison of 8-day and 15-day old flies, which represent the stage of full maturation and the beginning of the dying phase, respectively. Rates of both antimycin A-resistant respiration of isolated mitochondria and O2 generation at ubiquinone-cytochrome b site by submitochondrial particles increased during aging and were associated with life expectancy of flies. Flies destined to die earlier than their cohorts of the same age exhibited a relatively higher rate of O2- production. Age-related increase in O2- generation was not associated with corresponding changes in ubiquinone content of mitochondria.
