The lipid composition of cells of Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains resistant to polymyxin was compared with the lipid composition of cells of polymyxin-sensitive strains as to their content of readily extractable lipids (RELs), acid-extractable lipids, the fatty acid composition of RELs, and the contents of various phospholipids in the REL fraction. The polymyxin-resistant strains had an increased content of RELs, but a decreased phospholipid content. The REL fraction from the polymyxin-resistant strains had an increased content of unsaturated fatty acids accompanied by a decreased content of cyclopropane fatty acids as compared with the fatty acid composition of RELs from polymyxin-sensitive strains. The phosphatidylethanolamine content was greatly reduced in the polymyxin-resistant strains, whereas the content of an unidentified lipid, thought to be a neutral lipid lacking either a phosphate, free amino, or choline moiety, was greatly increased. Cell envelopes of the polymyxin-resistant strains contained reduced concentrations of Mg2+ and Ca2+ as compared with the cell envelopes of polymyxin-sensitive strains. It appears that polymyxin resistance in these strains is associated with a significant alteration in the lipid composition and divalent cation content of the cell envelope.
