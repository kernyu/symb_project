Azlocillin was administered alone to seven patients without malignant or blood disease presenting with septicaemia caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In 6 cases the infection developed after surgery and in 3 of these it was responsible for a state of shock, twice associated with acute anuric renal failure. The minimum inhibitory concentrations of azlocillin varied from 2 to 32 micrograms/ml; 5 strains were resistant to carbenicillin. The minimum inhibitory to minimum bactericidal concentrations ratio, measured on five occasions, was equal to 2. Bacterial eradication was obtained in 6 patients. One patient with multivisceral failure died during treatment and in this case the responsible organism had become resistant to azlocillin.
