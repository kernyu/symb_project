Experiments were made in dogs weighing 15-25 kg with experimental tourniquet shock (35 dogs) and experimental myocardial infarction (29 dogs). Intravenous injection of sodium thiosulfate (500 mg/kg) exerted a marked therapeutic effect on cardio- and central hemodynamics under acute circulatory disturbances both in tourniquet shock and myocardial infarction. Sodium thiosulfate increased cardiac discharge, minute blood flow volume, the first derivative, the threshold of ventricular fibrillation, improved the heart work, decreased and normalized the general peripheral resistance. This effect is likely to be related to the stimulation of intracellular metabolism and antidote action of sodium thiosulfate against ischemic toxin.
