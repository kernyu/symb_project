Time relations among trauma, pulmonary and systemic circulation, and lung function were studied in pigs. Eleven animals (b.w. 25-30 kg) were investigated under balanced anesthesia. Ventilation was mechanically controlled. Hemodynamics, pulmonary ventilation, and gas exchange were serially recorded. Seven animals were pretreated with 40% ethanol in saline and four with saline only. Ninety minutes after the ingestion of alcohol or saline, the animals were subjected to a standardized soft-tissue trauma. Cardiac output decreased significantly 2 minutes after trauma and remained low in both groups throughout the observation period of 30 minutes. Pulmonary vascular resistance was significantly increased in the alcohol-pretreated group but was virtually unchanged in the control animals. Systemic vascular resistance was similarly reduced in the two groups. Total compliance was somewhat lower in alcohol-pretreated animals and 10 minutes after the trauma arterial oxygen tension was significantly lower in the alcohol group than in control animals. Carbon dioxide elimination was reduced after trauma in both groups. It is concluded that pulmonary vascular response increased and that total pulmonary compliance is somewhat decreased shortly after trauma in the alcohol group while gas exchange is almost unchanged. The results indicate a negative interaction between alcohol and trauma.
