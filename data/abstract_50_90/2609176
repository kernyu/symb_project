20 patients with moderately severe bacterial infections were studied to determine the clinical efficacy and safety of parenteral sulbactam/ampicillin. There were 9 female and 11 male patients. Their mean age was 51 years. 8 patients had pneumonia, 5 urinary tract infection, 4 cellulitis of the leg and 3 had pustular tonsillitis. 85% of patients had resolution of fever and symptoms within 48 hours of commencing treatment. 95% had successful treatment outcome. The organisms isolated included E. Coli, Klebsiella sp, Branhamella catarrhalis and Bacillus species. In 2 patients, the organisms isolated demonstrated in-vitro ampicillin resistance. However, they recovered fully with sulbactam/ampicillin therapy. No adverse side-effects were reported and dosage adjustment was not required in the elderly.
