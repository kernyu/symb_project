Anaerobic antibiotic susceptibility testing with standardized methods enabled the authors to speculate on the evolution of antibiotic resistance within the Bacteroides fragilis group strains. Cefoxitin resistance was stable (0-5%) until 1985 and gradually increased later. Clindamycin resistance emerged in 1980 with a stable 10% resistance rate until 1986. An increase in clindamycin resistance developed in three institutions in 1987. No change was detected for imipenem and metronidazole, while piperacillin resistance increased since 1986. A comparison of antibiotic resistance rates is discussed for anaerobes in different countries.
