The frequencies of tetracycline resistance determinants of the classes A, B, C, and D were determined in 53 non-lactose-fermenting clinical isolates. The most frequent class of determinant in Salmonella typhimurium and Shigella flexneri strains was class B; however, the predominant determinant in Shigella sonnei strains was class C.
