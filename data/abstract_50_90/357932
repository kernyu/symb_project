Germ-free swine were artificially contaminated with tetracycline (TC) sensitive strains of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. One of these strains, E. coli 3306, was infected with a plasmid carrying kanamycin (KM) resistance, i.e., T-kan factor. Another strain, E. coli P-5, carried a conjugally transferable Col B factor. Among the nine strains used, only E. coli P-38 became TC-resistant after TC administration. Three types of TC-resistance E. coli P-38 strains were found; (a) one strain carried nontransferable TC resistance and could not produce colicin, (b) one strain carried TC resistance with a high transmission frequency which could not produce colicin, and (c) one strain carried TC resistance with a low transmission frequency that could produce colicin B. Genetic studies disclosed that the transmissible TC resistance factors, i.e., Rms105 (group b) and Rms104 (group c), were formed by recombination between Col B factor and nontransmissible TC-resistance (tet) determinant which appeared in E. coli P-38 mutants.
