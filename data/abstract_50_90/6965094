We have isolated emetine-resistant cell lines from Chinese hamster peritoneal fibroblasts and have shown that they represent a third distinct class or complementation group of emetine-resistant mutants, as determined by three different criteria. These mutants, like those belonging to the two other complementation groups we have previously defined, which were isolated from Chinese hamster lung and Chinese hamster ovary cells, have alterations that directly affect the protein biosynthetic machinery. So far, there is absolute cell line specificity with respect to the three complementation groups, in that all the emetine-resistant mutants we have isolated from Chinese hamster lung cells belong to one complementation group, all those we have isolated from Chinese hamster ovary cells belong to a second complementation group, and all those isolated from Chinese hamster peritoneal cells belong to a third complementation group. Thus, in cultured Chinese hamster cells, mutations in at least three different loci, designated emtA, emtB, and emtC, encoding for different components of the protein biosynthetic machinery, can give rise to the emetine-resistant phenotype.
