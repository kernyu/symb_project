In a study on neonatal bacteraemia among the high-risk neonates admitted into our neonatal unit at Wesley Guild Hospital, Ilesha, the incidence of bacteraemia in babies born in the hospital was 17/1000 live births and 71.6/1000 total admissions into the unit. Gram-negative bacteria accounted for about 58.1% of bacteria isolated and Staphylococcus aureus for 62% of the isolated Gram-positive bacteria. Among the commonly used antibiotics, gentamicin is the most favoured by the sensitivity test. S. aureus appeared more sensitive to erythromycin than to cloxacillin or ampicillin. The present policy of using the combination of gentamicin and cloxacillin and/or ampicillin is adequate for most agents encountered and therefore should continue. It is suggested that proper antenatal care, adequate supervision of delivery, better neonatal care and provision of better laboratory facilities will help to reduce the incidence of neonatal bacterial infection, improve the management of neonatal infection and reduce the morbidity and mortality from bacterial infection.
