The results of the study on the composition, properties and antibiotic sensitivity of pathogenic microbes isolated from purulent wounds of the soft tissues of patients treated in the Institute clinic in 1977-1980 are presented. The frequency of secondary infection of the purulent wounds was estimated. During this period the percentage of gram-negative bacteria isolated from opened purulent foci increased. In some cases investigation of the time course of the purulent processes revealed new microbial strains, such as pathogenic staphylococci or opportunistic gram-negative bacteria. Sometimes replacement of the causative agent by new organisms was observed. The new strains were high- and multiple-resistant to the antibiotics.
