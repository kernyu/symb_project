The spread of chloroquine resistant strains of P. falciparum requires new approaches to treatment especially in tropical Africa. A single dose of 3 tablets of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (Fansidar) is a suitable and relatively inexpensive alternative. But under drug pressure resistance to this compound has developed in some South-East Asian countries and in Brazil, giving rise to multiple resistant strains of P. falciparum. A similar pattern has arisen with quinine to which almost 50% of P. falciparum strains have become resistant in Thailand. However the combination treatment of quinine with tetracycline given for 7 days is still successful in most cases. Unfortunately compliance to this regimen is rather poor in out-patients. Mefloquine (Lariam), recently marketed, and if used as 750 mg dose in semi-immune adult patients weighing less than 60 kg, has made possible a single-dose treatment schedule for falciparum malaria. In controlled studies conducted in South-East Asia the success rate of mefloquine was 97% in 445 patients. Since there is some fear of the appearance of resistance of P. falciparum to mefloquine, a combination of this compound with sulfadoxine and pyrimethamine was developed (MSP or Fansimef). Various controlled studies in South-East Asia have shown a success rate of this compound of 97% in 278 patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
