We study 583 strains of enterococci isolates by 19 laboratories from Catalonia: 546 E. faecalis (93.5%), 34 E. faecium (6%) and 3 E. durans (0.5%). We inoculated all the strains in Mueller-Hinton agar with 2,000 mg/l of one of the following aminoglycoside: gentamicin, tobramycin, amikacin, streptomycin and kanamycin. Global incidence of high-level resistance was 9.4% to gentamicin, 7.3% to tobramycin, 0.2% to amikacin, 30.3% to streptomycin and 37.7% to kanamycin, with important changes in regard of procedence.
