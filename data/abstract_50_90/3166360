The efficacies of pefloxacin, fosfomycin, and both of these agents in combination against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus were assessed in a rat endocarditis model. The combination prevented emergence of the fosfomycin and pefloxacin resistance seen in 36 and 4%, respectively, of animals receiving either agent alone and was more effective than either agent in sterilizing cardiac vegetations.
