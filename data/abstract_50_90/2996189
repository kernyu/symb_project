From 6 clones of Chinese hamster cells varying in the rate of the loss of transformant phenotype and containing a thymidine kinase gene (tk-gene) of Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV1), 25 subclones negative in thymidine kinase (TK-) were isolated on a medium with 50 micrograms/ml 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU). A study was made of the frequency of spontaneous reversions to the TK+ phenotype in cell populations of BrdU-resistant subclones, and of the transforming activity (upon transformation of TK- cells of A238 clone to the TK+ phenotype) of DNA preparations from a row BrdU-resistant subclones. In 7 of 11 BrdU-resistant subclones the TK- phenotype is associated with changes reducing significantly the transforming activity of DNA. Some of these alterations are stable and undergo no spontaneous reversion, while the other ones are unstable, being reversed or suppressed at a high frequency. BrdU-resistant subclones produced from clones more stable in transformant phenotype are on the whole more stable in the TK- phenotype than BrdU-resistant subclones from the clones with the high rate of the loss of the TK+ phenotype.
