Mutations at the OLI 1 or OLI 2 loci of mitochondria DNA in Saccharomyces cerevisiae are associated with a diminished growth rate in nutritionally suboptimal cultures supplemented with an oxidizable carbon source. In the case of mutant OR146(OLI1) there is a 35% loss of mitochondrial protein during fractionation in vitro, suggesting that the mutationally altered adenosine triphosphatase(ATPase) confers some instability on the mitochondrial membrane. The possibility is discussed that this reflects an unstable mitchondrial population in vivo, leading the observed growth deficiency. Mitochondria from mutant OR146 at the OLI 1 locus show a relatively oligomycin-resistant State-3 respiration, but the same ADP/O and respiratory-control quotients as the isonuclear wild-type. A slightly lowered Qo2 with NADH-linked substrates was observed and is discussed. For both strains the apparent H+/O ratios were close to 4 with pyruvate, ethanol and alpha-oxoglutarate, but consistently lower with succinate and citrate. For each substrate a characteristic t 1/2 (time for half-decay of the transmembrane pH differential) range was found, consistent with the view that the substrates effecitvely carry the protons back across the membrane. As expected, H+/O ratios were independent of t 1/2 for all substrates, with the exception of alpha-oxoglutarate in the case of the wild-type, where an inverse correlation was found. The lack of this correlation in the case of the mutant was the only apparent difference in the translocation parameters observed. A hypothesis relating this to the functioning of the oligomycin-resistant ATPase is proposed.
