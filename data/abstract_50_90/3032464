A T-cell line of mixed phenotype (60% L3T4+, 40% Lyt-2+) was isolated from mice infected with Mycobacterium bovis (BCG). This line responded to M. lepraemurium and BCG but not to M. leprae and produced TCGF spontaneously. It also produced factors which stimulated macrophages to secrete hydrogen peroxide and superoxide anion. In vivo studies showed that only L3T4+ cells were required to transfer DTH responses and that Lyt-2+ cells suppressed this response. Both L3T4+ and Lyt-2+ cells were required to inhibit M. lepraemurium multiplication in vivo.
