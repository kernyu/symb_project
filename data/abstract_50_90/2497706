beta-Lactamase-producing (Bla+) enterococci are rare but have been reported from several areas. We report another Bla+ enterococcus with high-level gentamicin resistance. Susceptibility and bactericidal activity studies of four Bla+ enterococci against potential alternative antibiotics, including ampicillin-sulbactam, daptomycin, teicoplanin, and vancomycin, are presented.
