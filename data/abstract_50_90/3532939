The effect of prodigiosan, levamisol and methyluracil on the process of experimental sepsis caused by Proteus was studied comparatively on mice, and the primary immune response was studied on intact animals treated with prednisolone, cyclophosphan or azathioprin. It was shown that prodigiosan was a more active stimulator of antiinfectious resistance of the intact animals than levamisol or methyluracil. Its effect was evident with administration before the infection, while the effect of levamisol or methyluracil was evident in administration after the infection. When used prophylactically, prodigiosan increased the average life-span of the mice given prednisolone, had no effect on the infection process in the presence of cyclophosphan and increased the antibiotic therapy efficiency at the background of either prednisolone or cyclophosphan. Administration of prodigiosan after the infection without the use of antibiotics was not efficient in immunosuppression, whereas in combination with levamisol it increased the tolerance to the infection at the background of cyclophosphan. When used for the treatment purposes, levamisol had no effect on survival of the animals. However, it increased the average life-span of the intact mice also at the background of prednisolone. Prodigiosan stimulate the primary immune response in the intact animals at the background of azathioprin or cyclophosphan but not prednisolone. Levamisol increased the number of the antibody-producing cells (APC) in the intact animals in some experiments. At the background of azathioprin it had no effect on the number of the APC and at background of prednisolone or cyclophosphan it even lowered their number.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
