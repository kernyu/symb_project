The resistance patterns of Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains isolated from freshwater and seawater to different antimicrobial agents and heavy metals were studied. It was found that resistance in these environments is linked to the level of faecal pollution. All strains were resistant to ampicillin and tetracycline but sensitive to carbenicillin, amikacin, tobramycin, and colistin, and to the assayed concentrations of silver, cadmium, lead, and molybdenum. Resistance to gentamicin, sulphadiazine, mercury, arsenic, and chromium was variable, so their use as epidemiological markers was considered. There was a close relationship between the degree of pollution and the frequency of heavy metal resistant strains of Ps. aeruginosa. The highest frequencies of resistance to mercury and arsenic were obtained from marine environments with little faecal pollution, where the highest incidence of multi-resistant strains was also observed.
