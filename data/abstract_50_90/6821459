The antibacterial activity of N-formimidoyl thienamycin (MK0787) was evaluated in 335 clinical isolates of ampicillin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, 50 Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains, 28 Acinetobacter spp., 50 Streptococcus faecalis strains, and 7 oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains and was compared with the recently developed beta-lactam antibiotics mezlocillin, cefuroxime, cefazedone, cefoperazone, cefotaxime, and moxalactam. Among the gram-negative bacteria, N-formimidoyl thienamycin was less active than cefotaxime against Klebsiella, Serratia, and Proteus spp. but had comparable activity against Escherichia coli and Enterobacter strains. Activity of the thienamycin derivative was somewhat lower than that of moxalactam against most of the strains and superior to that of mezlocillin, cefuroxime, and cefoperazone. Moreover, N-formimidoyl thienamycin was the most active drug against P. aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp. and had activity comparable to that of ampicillin against Streptococcus faecalis. N-Formimidoyl thienamycin was bactericidal at concentrations less than twice the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) in all gram-negative isolates tested. Oxacillin-resistant staphylococci (MIC of oxacillin, greater than 4 micrograms/ml) were inhibited at low concentrations of the thienamycin derivative (90% MIC, 0.25 micrograms/ml); however, N-formimidoyl thienamycin was not bactericidal at the 90% MIC. The antibacterial activity of N-formimidoyl thienamycin against all of the gram-negative bacilli was observed to be independent of beta-lactamase production.
