An in vitro pharmacokinetic model was used to study the comparative antibacterial activities of multiple-dose regimens of enoxacin and netilmicin. Strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus were exposed to changing drug concentrations, mimicking human two-compartment pharmacokinetics. Oral administration was simulated for the quinolone, and intravenous administration was simulated for the aminoglycoside. Similar ratios of peak concentration to MIC resulted in similar changes in bacterial concentrations over time with both compounds. Following the initial dose, a rapid bactericidal effect occurred, with a greater than 99% reduction of the bacterial counts within 4 h at peak concentrations more than three times the MIC. However, bacterial regrowth occurred within 24 h unless the peak concentration/MIC ratio exceeded 8:1 (P less than 0.01). For the regrowing bacteria, MICs were four- to eightfold higher, and little or no bactericidal effect occurred following the second and subsequent doses. These data demonstrate the equally potent bactericidal activity of orally administered enoxacin and intravenously administered netilmicin. Selection of resistant subpopulations was similar with each drug. The peak concentration/MIC ratio may be an important parameter in the clinical use of quinolone and aminoglycoside antibiotics.
