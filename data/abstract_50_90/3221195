A 4 kb fragment of chromosomal DNA was cloned from a clinical strain of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. It comprises part of a section of the chromosome that was lost when the strain was cured of resistance to methicillin and to other antimicrobial agents. The fragment mediates an increased level of methicillin resistance when inserted into a shuttle vector and transformed back into the sensitive strain generated when the original DNA was deleted.
