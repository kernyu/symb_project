The frequency of the transduction of plasmids rms5, rms7, pT127, pC194, pS194 and pUB101 by phages belonging to serological group B (80, 52, 52A, 53, 85, phi 11, S2) in two systems was compared. In system 1 phages for transduction were obtained from plasmid-containing lysogenic donors in the process of induction with mitomycin C; in system 2 phages for transduction were obtained by their multiplication in plasmid-containing nonlysogenic donors. In system 1 the transduction of plasmids rms5, rms7, pT127, pS194 by phage 52A was found to occur with a greater (by 3-5 orders) frequency than in system 2 (the frequency of transduction was 10(-2) to 10(-4), and 10(-6) to 10(-8) respectively). A similar situation was observed with plasmids rms5 and rms7 and phage 52; plasmid pT127 and phage 53; but not observed with plasmids rms5 and rms7 and phages 80, phi 11 and S2; plasmids pC194 and pS194 and phage 53; plasmid pUB101 and phages 52A, 80 and phi 11; plasmids pC194, pS194 and pT127 and phage 85.
