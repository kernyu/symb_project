The value of chlortetracycline physical diffusion into the cells of the strains of Mycobacterium citreum sensitive and resistant to tetracyclines was estimated. Exclusion of the active transport was achieved with the use of 4 per cent formalin. It was shown that the scale of the 'passive' penetration of chlortetracycline into the cells of the sensitive and resistant strains was the same. Because of the physical diffusion up to 1/3 the absorbed antibiotic appeared to be transferred into the cells of the sensitive strain. When the sensitive strain was grown on the glucose medium, partial repression of formation of the transport system common for chlortetracycline and oxalacetic acid observed. In case of resistant strains the 'glucose effect' was absent.
