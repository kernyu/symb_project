Sensitivity of 690 cultures of the conditionally pathogenic microbes of Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonadaceae to 17 drugs was studied with the agar diffusion method. It was found that 98.6 per cent of the cultures had multiple resistance to 2--10 drugs. Most of the cultures were resistant to erythromycin, carbenicillin and ampicillin. Different species of the conditionally pathogenic microorganisms were resistant to different numbers of the drugs. Thus, Ps. aeruginosa cultures were resistant to 6--10 drugs, the cultures of Citrobacter were resistant to 3--8 drugs and the cultures of Kl. pneumonia were resistant to 2--5 drugs. Levomycetin, tetracycline, streptomycin and biseptol proved to be the most active antibacterial drugs.
