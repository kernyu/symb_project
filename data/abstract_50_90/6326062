Ceftizoxime is an iminomethoxy aminothiazolyl cephalosporin that inhibits a wide variety of aerobic, anaerobic gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. The majority of Enterobacteriaceae are inhibited by less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml as are streptococcal species with the exception of Streptococcus faecalis. Staphylococcus aureus are inhibited by 3-8 micrograms/ml, while methicillin-resistant. aureus are resistant. Bacteroides fragilis are inhibited by 16-64 micrograms/ml. It inhibits Pseudomonas aeruginosa at usually achievable concentrations. Ceftizoxime is overall similar in antibacterial activity to cefotaxime and moxalactam. Ceftizoxime is not hydrolyzed by common plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases. Serum levels of ceftizoxime after intramuscular and intravenous injection are similar to those of cefotaxime and moxalactam. The half-life is 1.6 to 1.9 hours in normal individuals. The compound is not metabolized and is cleared from the body by glomerular filtration. Ceftizoxime enters most body fluids, including the cerebrospinal fluid, to produce therapeutic concentrations against clinically important bacteria. Ceftizoxime accumulates in the presence of renal failure, but it is removed from the body by hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis. Ceftizoxime has proved to be an effective chemotherapeutic agent when used as treatment for pneumonia, urinary tract infections, osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, meningitis, peritonitis, gonorrhea, including penicillinase-producing isolates, and gynecological infections. No major adverse reactions have been associated with the use of ceftizoxime and it has produced neither disulfram -like reactions nor bleeding.
