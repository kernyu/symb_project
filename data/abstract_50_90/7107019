The subspecies intestinalis and fetus of Campylobacter fetus are opportunistic pathogens in humans. So far, some 200 types of disease due to these pathogens have been reported from all over the world, and six new diseases are briefly described in this paper. The most frequent disease is sepsis, followed by meningitis. While ticarcillin, erythromycin, clindamycin and tetracycline are the antibiotics which show activity against these species, a large degree of resistance is seen against cephalothin, cefazolin, cefuroxime, cefoxitin and cefotaxime. There is a moderate degree of sensitivity to gentamicin. The epidemiology of the disease is not clear, and about twice as many men are affected as women. Subspecies intestinalis was isolated in 95% of all diseases. Antibodies to Campylobacter fetus were detected in 3.9% of the population.
