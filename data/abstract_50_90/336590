Salmonella typhimurium-associated conjunctivitis in an adult female cat was characterized by epiphora and blepharospasm. The cat also harbored intestinal S typhimurium, as did one other cat in the same shipment of 7 cats obtained from a commercial cat dealer. The 3 isolates were resistant to ampicillin, cephaloridine, cephalothin, streptomycin, triple sulfonamides, and tetracycline. All 3 isolates were capable of transferring a part of the antibiotic resistance pattern to an Escherichia coli K-12 recipient. Salmonella were not recovered from the conjunctiva or fecal flora of either cat after 10 days of therapy with chloramphenicol.
