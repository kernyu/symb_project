The safety and clinical efficacy of cefoperazone 1 to 2g 12-hourly was evaluated in clinical trials conducted in the United States, Europe, South and Latin America, and Japan. 1046 patients were treated in 4 comparative and 9 non-comparative studies. An overall satisfactory clinical response for cefoperazone therapy was achieved in 540 (88%) of the 615 evaluable patients. Cefoperazone was effective in 92% of lower respiratory tract infections, 81% of urinary tract infections, 98% of gynaecological infections and 90% of a mixture of intra-abdominal, wound and soft tissue infections. A satisfactory clinical response was obtained in over 90% of patients infected with organisms normally susceptible to cephalosporins, such as staphylococci, streptococci, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella and Proteus species. 50 to 90% of infections caused by organisms resistant to presently available cephalosporins, such as Enterobacter species, Proteus vulgaris, Providencia species, Morganella morganii, Serratia species, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Bacteroides fragilis responded satisfactorily to cefoperazone. In the 4 clinical trials comparing cefoperazone with cefamandole, cephazolin or carbenicillin, cefoperazone therapy resulted in a similar or higher rate of satisfactory clinical response. Adverse reactions related to cefoperazone occurred in 8% of patients and were mainly diarrhoea (4%), skin reactions (3%) and phlebitis (1%). Twice daily dosing with cefoperazone appears to be effective against numerous Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria in a variety of clinical infections.
