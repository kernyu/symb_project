A device for mechanical application of either drops of phage suspensions or antibiotic-containing tablets was developed. The device consists of a Transport Apparatus which transports petri dishes from one side of the apparatus to the other in such a way that the plate and the lid of a petri dish become entirely separated at a particular stage. Either a Phage Applicating System or an Antibiotic Tablet Dispenser can be connected to the apparatus. In this way a maximum of 27 phages of 7 antibiotic tablets per plate can be applied pneumatically.
