Argentine Hemorrhagic Fever manifests itself in man either subclinically or in hemorrhagic or neurological forms, mortality reaching 20%. Although Candid 1 strain is undergoing pilot trials, current therapy still resorts to convalescent serum administration. A neurological model was used to evaluate protection conferred by the attenuated XJC13 Junin virus strain. Newborn rats inoculated intraperitoneally (ip) prove resistant, whereas 8-12 day-old animals infected by intracerebral route with the XJ prototype strain suffer 100% mortality with neurological signs. The aim of this study was to achieve protection in this model and attempt to elucidate the mechanisms involved in resistance. It was observed that the longer the inoculation challenge interval, the greater was the survival percentage. In protected animals, brain viral titres were 3 log lower than in challenged controls, while XJC13 infected unchallenged controls presented low CNS values throughout. Neutralizing antibody levels were not significantly different in experimental versus challenged control groups, ruling out any secondary booster effect on protected rats. Neither the transfer of immunoserum nor of endogenous or exogenous interferon altered mortality. However, when splenocytes from rats infected 10 days previously were transferred prior to XJ challenge, survival was increased to 50%, but there was no gain in protection when cells were treated with antithymocyte serum plus complement. Consequently, protection in this neurological model can be attributed to a cellular immune response.
