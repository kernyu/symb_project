Most (76%) of the 284 gentamicin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae isolated from patients hospitalised in Eindhoven or its vicinity proved to be sensitive to netilmicin. The sensitivity rate was 96% for amikacin and 97% for cefotaxime. Thirty-four patients with systemic infections and isolation of netilmicin-sensitive Enterobacteriaceae were treated with 150 mg netilmicin intravenously every 12 h. All except one patient reacted favourably. The patient who did not had a netilmicin-sensitive Escherichia coli septicaemia which recurred during treatment. The treatment was well tolerated. No ototoxicity or permanent nephrotoxicity were noted. Although the variation of serum levels was as great for netilmicin as has been reported for other aminoglycosides, they were in general within acceptable limits. In patients with reduced renal function peak levels above 16 mg/l were found five times more frequently than in patients with normal renal function. However, serum levels should also be monitored in patients with normal renal function.
