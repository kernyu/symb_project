The Long-Sleep (LS) and Short-Sleep (SS) mice were bred for differences in sensitivity to ethanol as measured by duration of loss of the righting response (sleep time). The foundation population was a heterogeneous stock (HS) which was derived from a cross of eight inbred strains. Ethanol-induced sleep time and waking blood and brain ethanol levels were measured in the eight inbred strains, LS, SS and HS mice. The C3H and ISBI strains were quite resistant to ethanol as measured by sleep time, and only one, RIII, was very sensitive. Waking ethanol concentrations were similar for all of the inbreds, implying a narrow range of central nervous system sensitivity to ethanol. The HS mice had relatively short sleep times and blood ethanol levels equal to most of the inbred. The LS mice were significantly more, and the SS mice significantly less sensitive to ethanol than any of the inbreds or HS mice. These studies suggest that the extremes of CNS sensitivities to ethanol manifested by the LS and SS mice cannot be traced to any of the inbred strains, and must have arisen through the selection process by changes in allelic frequencies of those genes conferring ethanol sensitivity and resistance.
