Forty percent to 60% of antimicrobial agents administered in hospitals without effective antimicrobial review and control programs are not needed. Excessive use of antimicrobial agents in the hospital promotes colonization of patients with resistant organisms, needlessly exposes them to the risk of an adverse drug reaction, and increases the cost of care. A gradated antimicrobial utilization review program is presented that determines hospital usage, develops guidelines for appropriate cost-effective drug administration, provides several options for implementation, and monitors outcome so that measures can be modified for specific situations. The techniques used are basic epidemiologic measures currently used to assess hospital infections.
