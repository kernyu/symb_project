The role of various surface virulence factors in bacterial resistance to opsonophagocytosis has been investigated in relation to the effect of clindamycin at concentrations below those which inhibit growth (sub-MIC). In each case studied (Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus and Bacteroides fragilis) contact with the drug under these conditions potentiated complement-mediated opsonization of the bacterial cells resulting in a greater and more rapid deposition of C3 as C3b on the cell surface. Several other features of the phagocytic process were enhanced in consequence.
