Sensitivity to penicillins, tetracycline, erythromycin and lincomycin was tested in 1513 staphylococcal strains isolated from the skin of various anatomic areas of the breast of nursing mothers. It was shown that 82.9, 78.4 and 33.9 per cent of the isolated cultures were highly sensitive to lincomycin, erythromycin and methicillin respectively. Sensitivity to tetracycline and benzylpenicillin was detected in 33.1 and 19.8 per cent of the cultures respectively. The study of the resistance spectra of 1343 strains resistant to certain antibiotics revealed that 498 cultures (37.1 per cent) were polyresistant. None of the tested antibiotics could be used for selective decontamination of the breast skin with respect to S. aureus in prophylaxis of lactic mastitis.
