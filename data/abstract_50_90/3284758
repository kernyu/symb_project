Natural isolates of Plasmodium falciparum represent a genetically heterogeneous population of parasites. To obtain stable strains of the parasites for long term experiments, a rapid and definitive method of cloning was developed using micropipets and a micromanipulator. Homogeneous parasite clones prepared by this technique were characterized and compared with the parent isolates during 4 years of continuous culture. The process of phenotypic dominance and selection of drug resistance which occur in nature was also simulated in vitro by evaluating population dynamics of two cocultured isolates of P. falciparum.
