Six different Staphylococcus aureus plasmids have been examined for compatibility relationships and their intracellular DNA pools have been measured singly and in various combinations. All six were mutually compatible, but contrary to expectation, their intracellular DNA pools were not additive; instead, there appeared to be a maximum level of extrachromosomal DNA that could be supported by the cell, and the plasmids studied approached this level individually as well as in varous combinations. One exception was encountered: a plasmid encoding kanamycin/neomycin resistance was present in a small but constant number of copies regardless of the presence of other plasmids.
