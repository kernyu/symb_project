Agar dilution antimicrobial susceptibility tests were carried out against rhamnose-positive Y. enterocolitica strains isolated from various origins. All the strains were susceptible to aminoglycosides, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, minocycline, rifampicin, trimethprim and sulfamethoxazole. All but two strains were susceptible to polymyxin. Resistnace to ampicillin, carbenicillin and cephalothin was noted with the majority of the strains.
