Ascorbate (vitamin C) in the presence of copper yields H2O2, which seems to be responsible for its toxic effects in bacteria. However, we found that the Escherichia coli xthA mutant strain, which is hypersensitive to H2O2, has almost the same sensitivity as the wild-type strain to ascorbate and copper treatment. Our results suggest that the DNA damage induced in E. coli by H2O2 generated in oxidized ascorbate solutions is different from that induced by direct H2O2 treatment.
