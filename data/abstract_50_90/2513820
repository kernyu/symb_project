A study of veterinary drug residues in the environment of pigs and their effects on selection of bacterial resistances via external contact. Slurry containing sulphonamide (sulphadimidine) residues in a similar concentration to that which could be expected after medication of a pig herd was applied to the stable floor. In reaction to that faecal E. coli of non-medicated pigs showed no significant variations of total bacterial resistance. However some variations concerning the rate of multiple resistant E. coli were manifest. They passed away although drug residues were still detectable.
