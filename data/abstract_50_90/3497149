The activities of niridazole and metronidazole against Trichomonas vaginalis C1-NIH and six isolates of clinical origin were compared using the in-vitro assay technique. Under the standard anaerobic assay conditions both metronidazole and niridazole were highly effective at low concentrations against all the strains used. However niridazole, in contrast to metronidazole, was equally effective in the aerobic assay, a feature which may be exploited in the chemotherapy of patients with refractory trichomoniasis.
