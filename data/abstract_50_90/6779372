Among 272 gram-negative bacilli, regarded as strains with reduced susceptibility to gentamicin by the disc test, 156 strains were resistant (greater than or equal to f microgram/ml) by the agar dilution method. Altogether 76% of the 156 strains were cross-resistant to tobramycin, kanamycin, streptomycin and amikacin. Amikacin showed the highest antibacterial activity in vitro. 32 of the resistant strains produced acetylating or adenylylating enzymes, which caused resistance. The production of enzymes was not limited to any genera. Complete cross-resistance to aminoglycoside antibiotics was recorded in 45%, 98% and 22% respectively, of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Ps. maltophilia and other gram-negative rods. Enzyme-producing strains were not cross-resistant to all aminoglycosides. Changes in MICs and inhibition zones with different inocula among enzyme-producing strains emphasize the importance of standardized inocula in susceptibility testing.
