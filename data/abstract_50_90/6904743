A study of the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) for 200 strains of Salmonella sp. has been performed with the following beta-lactamic antibiotics: mezlocillin and azlocillin (penicillins), cephaclor, cephamandole, cephuroxime and cephotaxime (cephalosporins), and cephoxytine (cephamycin). The MIC has been compared with that of chloramphenicol, ampicillin, amoxicillin and cotrimoxazole, all of them widely used antibiotics for the treatment of Salmonella infections in Spain. The different species and serotypes of Salmonella studied were all sensitive to all the beta-lactamic antibiotics tested. Of particular relevance is the fact that cephotaxime (HR 756) MIC was extraordinarily low even for strains resistent to the penicillins. The MIC of cephaclor, and oral cephalosporin, was similar to that of the parenteral cephalosporins.
