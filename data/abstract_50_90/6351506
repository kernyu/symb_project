Antibiotic-resistant bifidobacteria have the ability to actively interact with mucosal tissue from the intestine of mice and rats in vitro and to adapt well in the intestinal tract of normal and germ-free rats, when introduced both with and without antibiotics; in some cases antibiotics enhance the ability of bifidobacteria to adapt in the intestine. The interaction between antibiotic-resistant bifidobacteria and mucosal tissue from the intestine remains unaffected by the prolonged action of 0.1M SDS and Tween-80 solutions, 0.1% trypsin and hyaluronidase. Antibiotic-resistant bifidobacteria introduced into the intestinal tract of rats in combination with gentamycin effectively inhibit the multiplication of exogenous enterobacteria infecting the digestive tract after the cessation of the antibiotic administration.
