Staphylococcal infection caused by intracerebral inoculation with a highly virulent strain of Staph.aureus was studied on 1410 albino mice. The inoculation doses ranged within 1,5 . 10(6)--1 . 10(9) microbial cells. It was found that the infection was characterized by the development of generalized necrotic purulent encephalomeningitis. Extensive necrotic areas in the brain tissue and formation of abscesses were the main features of the process. Purulent affection of the encephali mater was of a focal or diffuse nature. Osteomyelitic foci in the ossa cranii at the inoculation site were detected in 50 per cent of the animals. Generalization of the infection after intracerebral inoculation of the mice with Staph.aureus was confirmed by isolation of the staphylococci from the blood and internal organs of the animals at early stages of the infection, i.e. in 5-10 minutes and by development of purulent metastatic foci in the myocardium, kidneys and lung tissue. The chemotherapeutic effect of dioxidine (1,4-di-N-oxide 2,3-dioxy-methylquinoxaline) administered orally or subcutaneously in a single dose of 200-400 mg/kg 30 minutes after inoculation was shown on the chemotherapeutic model which is thus recommended for chemotherapeutic investigations.
