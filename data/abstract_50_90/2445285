Susceptibility to inorganic mercuric ions and to organomercurials of 237 Pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical strains isolated in Mexico was determined by agar dilution tests. Resistant strains fell into two classes: i) narrow-spectrum resistant strains (27% of total isolates) resistant only to mercuric ions and to merbromin, and most grouped in pyocin type 1; and ii) broad-spectrum resistant strains (5%) with additional resistances to thimerosal, phenylmercury, methylmercury and p-hydroxymercuribenzoate, that belonged mostly to pyocin type 10. Mercurial resistant isolates showed a higher proportion of resistance to antibiotics and metals than did mercurial sensitive isolates, and broad-spectrum resistant strains had the highest frequency of resistance to antibiotics and to tellurite and arsenate.
