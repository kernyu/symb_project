In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, diuron, antimycin and myxothiazol block the respiratory pathway at the bc1 complex level. Nuclearly inherited mutations located at the DIU3 and DIU4 loci confer in vitro resistance to diuron and cross-resistance to antimycin and myxothiazol at the NADH oxidase level. The mutant strains do not exhibit diuron resistance at the quinol-cytochrome-c oxidoreductase level. Thus, the apparent resistance does not seem to be the result of a modification of the inhibitory sites. Instead, the quinone reduction rate was found to be altered in the mutant. The diu3 mutations lead to a deficiency of the NADH--ubiquinone oxidoreductase activity, and the diu4 mutations to a deficiency of the succinate--ubiquinone oxidoreductase activity. On the basis of the model of Kroger and Klingenberg, a decrease of quinone reduction could explain the resistance to the bc1 complex inhibitors. Thus, the apparent resistance to the bc1 complex inhibitors was found to be due to a modification of the electron transfer kinetics.
