The etiological picture of lactation mastitis and sensitivity of its causative agent to some antibiotics were studied. Mostly microbial associations were isolated from the patients. Pathogenic staphylococci typed mainly by the phages of group I predominated among the isolates. In addition the strains of Proteus, Pseudomonas, E. coli and others were isolated from the pus of the mastitis cases. Sensitivity of the microflora to some antibiotics was studied. It was found that most of the causative agents of the postnatal mastitis possessed multiple resistance. They were mainly resistant to benzylpenicillin, streptomycin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, oleandomycin and sensitive to oxacillin, methicillin, kanamycin and rifampicin. It was shown that during the patients stay under tha stationary conditions the postoperative wound were infected for the second time with hospital microbial strains.
