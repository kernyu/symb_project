A novel approach to determine the tetracycline susceptibility of Chlamydia trachomatis directly from specimens without cell culture propagation and adaptation has been explored. Out of a total of 1290 genital specimens from a sexually transmitted disease clinic, 211 (16.4%) were positive for C. trachomatis. A tetracycline concentration of 0.032 microgram/ml completely inhibited the appearance of inclusions in all of the 211 positive specimens. Of the positive specimens, 120 (56.9%) and 18 (8.5%) respectively showed the presence of 1 to 9 and 100 or more inclusions per microtiter well in antibiotic free medium. Other antibiotics are being tested in the same manner.
