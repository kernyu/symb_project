The survival of strains of Staphylococcus aureus on glass at 30 degrees C, 37 degrees C, and room temperature was compared with derivatives of them that had either lost or gained naturally occurring antibiotic resistance. In other properties the sets of strains were identical. Neither loss nor gain of antibiotic resistance (methicillin, penicillinase, streptomycin, tetracycline, erythromycin, neomycin) altered survival.
