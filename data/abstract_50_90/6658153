Three 6 month antituberculous regimes were compared during a controlled trial in Algiers. Isoniazid and Rifampicin were used every day for six months in all three regimes; a third drug was used as a supplement in two of the three regimes during the first three months (Ethambutol or Pyrazinamide). The aim of the study was to assess the role of the third drug and also the suitability of a self-administered regime in routine practice. The results were analysed at eighteen months, twelve months after the end of therapy. The third drug had no influence on outcome in patients with sensitive organisms. There was a 2.5% relapse rate with no significant difference between the groups. On the other hand the third drug was crucial for those patients initially resistant to Isoniazid, because a relapse or failure due to primary resistance was avoided. The 6 month regimes were well tolerated: the treatment was only changed in 0.8% of cases for major toxicity. Finally, short self-administered oral regimens were well tolerated by the patients.
