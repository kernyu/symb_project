Among 244 strains of S. pneumoniae, 24% are resistant to tetracycline, 10% to sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (SMZ-TMP) and 1.6% to erythromycin. A low grade resistance to penicillin G is observed in two strains (MIC 0,12 and 0,3 mg/l). Clinical correlations indicate that only 48% of the S. pneumoniae isolated are undoubtedlzy responsible for bacterial infection. The serotypes isolated from blood cultures and from other specimens are not statistically different. Only 67% of the strains belonged to serotypes included in the 14-valent vaccine.
