The activity of cefotetan against multiresistant strains of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella aerogenes was comparable with that of cefotaxime and ceftazidime, the mean MICs being 0.11 and 0.06 mg/l, respectively. Multiresistant strains of Enterobacter cloacae showed a high level of resistance to cefotetan in common with other cephalosporins such as cefuroxime, cefamandole and cefoxitin, but were sensitive to ceftazidime and cefotaxime.
