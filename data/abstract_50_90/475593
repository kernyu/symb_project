The experiments presented here deal with the effects of the inhalation of dichlorvos [dimethyl-(2,2 dichlorvinyl)-phosphate, DDVP] vapor on acetylcholinesterase (ACHE) activity in rat bronchial tissue. Exposure to DDVP concentrations of 0.8 and 1.8 micrograms/l for 3 days reduced ACHE activity in the bronchial tissue (62.8 +/- 0.8 and 51.6 +/- 1.6% of the control), but did not elicit any changes in blood ACHE activity (101 +/- 4.5% of the control each). Higher concentrations (4.3 micrograms/l) induced a decline in ACHE activity also in the blood (38.2 +/- 1.1% of the control). In the histochemical preparations used to demonstrate ACHE activity in bronchial tissue (thiolacetic acid method), a staining of the bronchial glands and smooth muscles characteristic of the enzyme activity was strongly reduced after exposure of the animals to even the lowest dose applied (0.2 microgram/l). The question of whether localized inhibition of ACHE in the bronchial tissue might cause increases in airway resistance due to activation of a broncho-bronchial reflex is discussed. This efferent cholinergic mechanism has been found to be at least partly responsible for maintenance of bronchospasm and hypersecretion in chronic obstructive diseases of the respiratory system.
