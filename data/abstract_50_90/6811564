Plasmid pBD9, which comprises two plasmids from Staphylococcus aureus, pE194 and pUB110, was joined to plasmid pBR322 by in vitro recombination to form plasmid pKH80. The ermC gene of plasmid pE194 confers inducible resistance to macrolide, lincosamide, and streptogramin type B antibiotics. When pKH80 was transferred to Escherichia coli K-12, the bacteria became resistant to several of these antibodies.
