An open lung biopsy in a 67-year-old man revealed nocardiosis as the cause of a treatment-resistant pulmonary infection. His resistance had been weakened by a non-Hodgkin lymphoma, polychemotherapy and long-term steroid medication. The nocardiosis was cured by a 26-day high-dosage regimen of imipenem and amikacin in combination. A six-month period of co-trimoxazole followed to ensure treatment success. Nocardia asteroides (biovariety A3) was found to be the causative organism, the second time that this has been described as cause of a human infection.
