A herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) mutant TS6 (strain HG52) induces a heat-labile viral DNA polymerase at the nonpermissive temperature and is markedly resistant to 9-[[2-hydroxy-1-(hydroxymethyl)ethoxy]methyl]-guanine [2'-nor-2'-deoxyguanosine; 2'NDG]. This antiviral drug requires HSV thymidine kinase for phosphorylation to an active inhibitor (2'NDG-triphosphate), and thymidine kinase-deficient mutants of HSV exhibit varying degrees of resistance to 2'NDG, with the HSV type 1 (HSV-1) B2006 mutant (Kit) being markedly resistant. The ts6 mutation and the 2'ndgR-1 mutation within the viral DNA polymerase locus have been physically mapped by marker rescue and generation of HSV-1/HSV-2 intertypic recombinants. The physical map limits for the ts6 mutation and 2'ndgR-1 mutation are closely linked within a 2.2-kilobase-pair region of DNA sequences and are physically separate from the paaR-1 and acvR-1 mutations. Resistance to 2'NDG by HSV-2 ts6 can be overcome in the presence of combinations of 2'NDG and phosphonoacetic acid, indicating drug synergism within the viral DNA polymerase locus. These physical mapping studies expand the limits of DNA sequences defining an active center in the viral polymerase to 3.5 kilobase pairs, indicating that regions spanning the entire polymerase polypeptide may contribute to a specialized surface able to interact with nucleotides of different structure.
