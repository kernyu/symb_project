Two plasmid deoxyribonucleic acid sequences mediating multiple antibiotic resistance transposed in vivo between coexisting plasmids in clinical isolates of Serratia marcescens. This event resulted in the evolution of a transferable multiresistance plasmid. Both sequences, designated in Tn1699 and Tn1700, were flanked by inverted deoxyribonucleic acid repetitions and could transpose between replicons independently of the Excherichia coli recA gene function. Tn1699 and Tn1700 mediated ampicillin, carbenicillin, kanamycin, and gentamicin resistance but differed in the type of gentamicin-acetyltransferase enzymes that they encoded. The structural genes for these enzymes share a great deal of polynucleotide sequence similarity despite their phenotypic differences. The transposition of Tn1699 and Tn1700 to coresident transferable plasmids has contributed to the dissemination of antibiotic resistance among other gram-negative bacteria. These organisms have recently caused nosocomial infections in epidemic proportions.
