A hybrid plasmid was constructed between the 5.3-megadalton plasmid (pUH24) of Anacystis nidulans R2 and the Escherichia coli plasmid pBR322. This was accomplished by adding a transposon to pBR322 and transforming this DNA into A. nidulans. One resultant hybrid, pLS103, had a molecular weight of 6.8 x 10(6), replicated in both organisms, had unique sites for two restriction endonucleases, conferred ampicillin resistance on both organisms, and could be used as a cloning vector in A. nidulans.
