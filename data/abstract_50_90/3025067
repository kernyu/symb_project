Transposon Tn10 was transposed into phage L (Salmonella typhimurium) from F'ts114lac+zzf::Tn10 plasmid of strain TT629 (Chumely et al. 1979). Phage L with the insertion Tn10 (L::Tn10-8) was isolated in the form of a prophage in the lysogenic strain S. typhimurium LT2-18 (L::Tn10-8), in which it can be induced with UV light. The phage induced in this way is defective; however, it forms plaques at a multiplicity of infection (moi) greater than one and transduces the tetracycline-resistance determinant to tetracycline-sensitive cells. Analysis of its DNA by restriction endodeoxyribonucleases revealed insertion of the intact transposon Tn10 of 9300 bp in the E fragment, formed during the action of EcoRI, at a distance of 16,800 bp from the pac site.
