Staphylococcus aureus isolated from purulent material has been systematically submitted to seroagglutination by Pillet's method as from 1972 to 1976. 495 serotyped strains from 333 patients are considered in the spread of infection. Epidemiological incidence and antibiotic resistance of each serotype is evaluated. As a result a new approach has been introduced in the operating theatre and in the wards. Hospital serotypes tend to disappear and new serotypes appear less virulent.
