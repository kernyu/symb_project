The serogroup pattern of 87 clinical isolates of Neisseria gonorrhoeae was determined by monoclonal coagglutination and the in-vitro activity of seven antimicrobial agents against the same strains was tested by an agar dilution method. The frequency of resistance to spectinomycin, ampicillin, penicillin, erythromycin, chloramphenicol and tetracycline was 14.9%, 33.3%, 34.4%, 30%, 40.2% and 41.3%, respectively. All strains were susceptible to cefotaxime. Out of 87 strains tested, 29.8% produced beta-lactamases and 4.5% were chromosomally resistant to penicillin. In all instances resistance to a drug was associated with serogroup 1-B except for erythromycin. The results presented here correlate with observations made worldwide.
