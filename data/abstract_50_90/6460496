Piperacillin was administered in eighteen patients with mixed infections. Three had osteomyelitis, two had peritonitis, two had gangrenous toes, one had bronchopneumonia, and the other ten had leg ulcers of various types accompanies by cellulitis. In eleven patients one of the infecting organisms was Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and another had Pseudomonas maltophilia. All had appropriate surgical treatment, which in nine patients included skin grafting in the presence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. All the patients were clinically cured except for one with osteomyelitis who relapsed and was found to have a residual sequestrum. None of the skin grafts failed. In other patient who underwent grafting, cloxacillin was also given because she had a beta-lactamase-producing staphylococcus. The only adverse reaction was thrombophlebitis of the vein used for drug administration in 15 out of 18 patients. One hundred and five other isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were tested in the laboratory against piperacillin and resistance to the drug was found to be rare. It was concluded that piperacillin is a safe drug to use, is effective against a wide range of organisms, and is particularly effective in preventing the destruction of skin grafts by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. It is likely to be ineffective against beta-lactamase-producing staphylococci, and when these are present also, it would be wise to use another drug such as cloxacillin in addition.
