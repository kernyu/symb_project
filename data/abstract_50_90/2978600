The effects were studied in vitro of a score of various additives to toilet soaps on strains of Candida albicans isolated from patients. Their effect on the basic properties of toilet soaps was studied, determining foam production and the index of foam stability, and their resistance to high temperature was determined since in the process of production high temperature might reduce their effects on C. albicans. The strongest fungicidal effect was exerted in strongly alkaline soap solutions by Clotrimazole. Good effects were obtained also using Clioquinol, a derivative of 8-hydroxyquinoline. The results of these studies suggest that certain substances may be added for exerting a fungicidal effect in alkaline medium protecting thus against fungal infections.
