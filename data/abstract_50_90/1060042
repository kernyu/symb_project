A series of experiments is described in which two drug-resistant strains of Eimeria maxima were passaged together in untreated chicks. The resultant oocysts were then inoculated into chicks treated with both drugs. When strains resistant to methyl benzoquate and sulphaquinoxaline or clopidol and sulphaquinoxaline were used the resultant infections were not controlled by the double treatment, indicating the acquisition of resistance factors by one strain from the other. When strains resistant to clopidol and methyl benzoquate were used the phenomenon was not observed.
