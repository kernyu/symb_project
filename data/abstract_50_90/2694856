The question to be answered in this study was: Is prophylactic selective florasuppression advantageous compared to conventional antibiotic policy as far as microbial colonisation, infection, mortality and development of resistance are concerned? A prospective, consecutive, placebo-controlled study in two ICU's was carried out during four 6-months periods. 200 patients who were intubated for at least 3 days, required intensive care for a minimum of 5 days, and belonged to either class III or IV according to the "Therapeutic Intervention Scoring System" were included in the study. They received either placebo or the prophylaxis regimen described by Stoutenbeek et al., consisting of polymyxin E, tobramycin and amphotericin B. Oropharyngeal, tracheobronchial and rectal colonisation with aerobic gram-negative bacilli markedly decreased in the test groups. The rates of nosocomial bronchopulmonary infections (ICU I and II) and urinary tract infections (ICU II) were significantly reduced. There was no significant reduction in wound infection, septicaemia and mortality rates. No development of resistance and no increase of multi-resistant strains occurred. Selective florasuppression is effective in reducing infection rates in critically ill patients without development of resistant strains.
