Sensitivity of 320 strains of P. aeruginosa to 12 antibiotics was studied. It was shown that tobramycin, gentamicin, polymyxin B, carbenicillin, and combinations of tobramycin and gentamicin with carbenicillin were the most effective. The synergism of the combinations was observed in 100 and 94.7 per cent of patients, respectively. One per cent dioxidine solution was shown to be highly active against 84.7 per cent of P. aeruginosa strains. Sensitivity of P. aeruginosa to surface active substances, such as N-cetylpyridinium chloride (N-CPC), rokkal and chlorhexidine was studied with the method of 2-fold serial dilutions. It was found that 66.6 per cent of the strains were sensitive to N-CPC in dilutions of 1:80--1:160. The respective figures for rokkal and chlorhexidine were 1:10--1:40 and 1:40. The drugs were used in treatment of patients with P. aeruginosa wound infections. Five patients were treated with intraosteal administration of gentamicin in a mixture for prolonged antiinflammation blockade. Investigation of the therapeutic concentrations revealed that high concentrations of gentamicin were attained in the wound even in an hour and maintained for 10 hours. No gentamicin was detected in the wound in 48 hours. The combined use of the antibacterial drugs provided efficacy of the chemotherapy.
