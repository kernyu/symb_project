In this study, the antibiotic sensitivity results of some gram-negative bacilli to aminoglycosides have been presented. 704 E. coli, 152 Klebsiella, 158 Proteus, 155 Pseudomonas strains were examined. These bacilli were isolated from the clinical samples at the bacteriology lab.in Ibni Sina Hospital, between January 1986-January 1987. The percents of E. coli strains susceptible to gentamicin, tobramycin, netilmicin and amikacin were 74%, 84%, 90%, 85% respectively. The sensitivity pattern of Proteus strains to the same antibiotic at the same order was 45%, 57%, 68, 84%. On the other hand 52%, 61%, 87%, 92% of Klebsiella strains and 32%, 53%, 86%, 81% of Pseudomonas strains have been found to be susceptible to gentamicin, tobramycin, netilmicin and amikacin respectively. According to these results, the resistance of gram-negative bacilli to aminoglycosides (including amikacin) is relatively high in our hospital, but amikacin or netilmicin should be preferred to others in which cases aminoglycoside therapy is considered.
