Germs resistant to disinfectants have been found by various authors in hospitals. The question arise whether this is a case of primary resistance or - similar to resistance to antibiotics - a development of resistance takes place. Five fully sensitive laboratory germs were exposed for longer periods of time to sublethal doses of four basic constituents of disinfectants (phenole, isopropanole, formaldehyde, chloramine 80). After a different number of passages an increasing resistance could be noted against formaldehyde and chloramine 80. To date no comments are possible regarding the mechanisms of action.
