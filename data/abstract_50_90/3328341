Artemisinin is a novel antimalarial drug isolated in China from the wormwood plant Artemisia annua L. Studies with rodent malaria were carried out to detect antagonism and synergism with a variety of antimalarial drugs. Isobolograms of drug interaction were plotted at the ED90 level. With a normally susceptible strain of Plasmodium berghei, marked potentiative synergism was found with mefloquine, tetracycline and spiramycin. There was some synergism also with primaquine. Combinations of artemisinin with dapsone, sulfadiazine, sulfadoxine, pyrimethamine, pyrimethamine/sulfadoxine and cycloguanil showed antagonism. A high degree of potentiation was shown between artemisinin and primaquine with a primaquine-resistant strain, whilst the combination with mefloquine showed enhanced potentiation with a mefloquine-resistant strain. Combinations of artemisinin with mefloquine, primaquine, tetracycline or clindamycin showed marked potentiation with an artemisinin-resistant strain. The mechanisms underlying the drug interactions observed are discussed.
