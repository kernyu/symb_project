Over an 8-year period, two epidemics of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) occurred in a burn unit. Sources of sepsis were the burn wound and lung. Fourteen percent of the patients colonized with MRSA became bacteremic. The mean postburn day of bacteremia was 19 and the mortality rate was 5 percent. MRSA was introduced to the burn unit when a patient was transferred from another unit, on readmission of a previously infected patient, or heavy burn census when MRSA was epidemic in the hospital. Although the morbidity rate associated with MRSA infections was high, the mortality rate was low. Gram-negative sepsis has continued to be more lethal.
