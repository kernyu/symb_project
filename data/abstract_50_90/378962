Acriflavine-resistant mutants were isolated from an acriflavine-sensitive (acrA) strain of Escherichia coli K-12 and then tested for temperature sensitivity of cell division. Genetic analysis characterized two new genetic loci, acrC and acrD. The former was mapped between tonA and proA, and the latter between the origin of genetic transfer of HfrH and serB. acrC and acrD mutants could divide but did not initiate a new round of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) replication at 43 degrees C. DNA synthesis of the acrC mutant cells ceased after a period of time following temperature shift-up, and thereafter DNA degradation occurred. However, cell mass continued to increase for a long time at the nonpermissive temperature. On the other hand, DNA synthesis of the acrD mutant cells ceased soon after the shift-up, and the cell mass did not appreciably increase during the prolonged incubation.
