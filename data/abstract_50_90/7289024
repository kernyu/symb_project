The authors have carried out the laboratory and clinical studies of cefoxitin. The results were as follows: The sensitivity was estimated by plate dilution method on 26 strains of S. aureus, 25 strains of E. coli, 24 strains of K. pneumoniae, 27 strains of Serratia and 17 strains of Salmonella isolated from patients. The distribution of sensitivity of S. aureus was 1.56-3.13 microgram/ml and the peak of distribution was 3.13 microgram/ml. The strains of 76.0% of E. coli was inhibited at concentration of less than 3.13 microgram/ml. The strains of 91.7% of K. pneumoniae was inhibited at concentration of less than 3.13 microgram/ml. The distribution of sensitivity of Serratia was 6.25-more than 100 microgram/ml and the peak of distribution was 100 microgram/ml. The all strains of Salmonella were inhibited at concentration of less than 3.13 microgram/ml. Cefoxitin was given by intravenous administration for 5 minutes at a single dose of 25 mg/kg of cefoxitin to 2 children, and by drip infusion for 60 minutes at a single dose of 25 mg/kg of cefoxitin to 4 children. After intravenous administration of cefoxitin, the mean peak of serum level was 67.3 +/- 6.3 microgram/ml at 15 minutes, and at 4 and 6 hours after administration was not detected. Half-life time was 22 minutes. And after drip infusion of cefoxitin for 60 minutes, the mean peak of serum level was 35.7 +/- 5.3 microgram/ml at 1 hour, and at 4 and 6 hours after administration was not detected. Half-life time was 20 minutes. The mean urinary recovery rate was 82.4 +/- 3.0% and 90.2 +/- 6.8% up to 6 hours after intravenous administration and drip infusion respectively. Cefoxitin was effective in all of 15 cases with bacterial infections. No side effects was observed.
