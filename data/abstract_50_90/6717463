Three 6-thioguanine (6TG)-resistant mutants were mutagen-treated and selected for clones capable of growing in 2 selective media: HAT medium, containing aminopterin (AP) and HAS medium, containing L-azaserine (AS). Both 6TG-sensitive, wild-type clones and 6TG-resistant mutants were found among colonies growing in HAT medium, while only 6TG-sensitive clones grew in HAS medium. Time for expression was required by 6TG-resistant but not by 6TG-sensitive clones, that were fully expressed immediately after treatment. All HAT-resistant, 6TG-resistant clones which were analyzed proved to be resistant to AP. These data were interpreted as follows: in HAT medium, both HGPRT+ revertants and double mutants (HGPRT-, AP-resistant) were selected, while only HGPRT+ revertants were selected in HAS medium. Not all 6TG-resistant mutants were able to produce both classes of HAT-resistant clones.
