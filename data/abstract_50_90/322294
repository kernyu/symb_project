Gentaminic was introduced in 1969 as a broad-spectrum aminoglycoside effective in vitro against a majority of aerobic gram-negative bacilli. In recent years gentamicin-resistant clinical isolates have become more prevalent. In our laboratory in 1975, 32% of Pseudomonas sp and 44% of indole-negative Proteus sp isolates were resistant to gentamicin. Resistance to tobramycin is also increasing; 24% of Escherichia coli and 28% of indole-negative Proteus sp isolates were found to be tobramycin-resistant. In addition, isolation of previously uncommon gentamicin-resistant species, ie, Proteus rettgeri and other indole-positive Proteus sp, from clinical specimens has increased dramatically in the past five years. This increase in gentamicin and tobramycin-resistant gram-negative bacilli serves as a constant stimulus for the development of new antimicrobial agents.
