A gonococcus was isolated from the vagina of a woman with pelvic inflammatory disease. The organism was typical in all respects except that, unlike any previously described gonococcus, it produced a beta-lactamase that conferred resistance to penicillin, ampicillin, and cephaloridine. Among other antibiotics tested streptomycin was the only one to which the organism was resistant.
