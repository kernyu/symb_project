The susceptibility of various Vibrio species to Midecamycin was studied by the tube dilution method. A MIC of 100 mug per ml of Midecamycin in BHI broth was taken as an indicator of bacterial resistance. All Vibrio cholerae classic biotype strains tested, were sensitive to Midecamycin. In respectively, 87.4%, 60.7% and 89.5% of Vibrio cholerae El Tor biotype, Vibrio parahaemolyticus and Vibrio NAG strains tested, were sensitive to Midecamycin.
