Clinical studies of resistance to cytosine arabinoside have not produced agreement as to the specific biochemical lesions responsible for altered sensitivity, although experimental and clinical work supports the concept that a decreased ability to generate ara-CTP must be the ultimate effect of this lesion. 3-deazauridine, an inhibitor of CTP synthetase, was found to enhance ara-CTP production in murine tumor cells, and in the present study, was shown to inhibit deamination of ara-C at both the nucleoside and nucleotide level. Enhanced ara-CTP formation was observed in cells lacking cytidine deaminase (L1 210 and HL60), indicating that 3-deazauridine inhibition of deoxycytidylate deaminase may be important in this drug interaction.
