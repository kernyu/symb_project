A total of 26 strains of Streptococcus cremoris and 12 strains of Streptococcus lactis were challenged with 18 antimicrobial agents and with nisin in the Bauer-Kirby disk susceptibility test. All strains were susceptible to ampicillin, bacitracin, cephalothin, chloramphenicol, chlortetracycline, erythromycin, penicillin G, tetracycline, and vancomycin. All strains were resistant to trimethoprim, and almost all strains were resistant to sulfathiazole. Variability in resistance to gentamicin, kanamycin, lincomycin, nafcillin, neomycin, nisin, rifampin, and streptomycin was observed. MICs of these substances for the less susceptible strains were determined, and high-level resistance factors could not be detected, except in the case of nisin. S. lactis ATCC 7962 was resistant to at least 40-fold-higher concentrations of nisin (greater than 64 micrograms/ml) than most other strains tested. This strain was a potent nisin producer.
