The therapeutic efficacy and safety of cefmetazole, a cephamycin-derived antibiotic in an injectable form were evaluated in patients with pyogenic infection in the dermatological field. Especially, it was found to be extremely effective for the skin diseases due to staphylococci or streptococci. The results obtained were the following; marked improvement in 18 cases and moderate improvement in 34 cases out of 61 cases, attaining efficacy of 86.7%. Side effects were noted as the rise of GOT and GPT in 3 cases, which were normalized by ceasing its further administration. The MIC of cefmetazole against Staphylococcus aureus isolated out of foci was 0.39-6.25 microgram/ml, while those of CEZ, CXM and ABPC used as the controls exceeded 50 microgram/ml in some cases. It is considered thus, that cefmetazole, is superior to these other antibiotics also in terms of MIC.
