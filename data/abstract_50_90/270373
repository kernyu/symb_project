Leukaemia cells from the peripheral blood and bone marrow of patients with acute myeloblastic leukaemia were labelled in vitro with [125I]5-iodo-2'-deoxy-uridine (IUdR). The myeloblasts were then injected into groups of mice and the survival of these cells estimated by measuring isotope loss, using whole-body counting. The isotope excretion from mice treated with various doses of cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C) and those not treated with drugs were compared. This comparison showed that the sensitivity of myeloblasts to the drug varies from patient to patient, and in one case was different for myeloblasts from bone marrow and from blood from the same patient. We compare the clinical responses of myeloblasts to Ara-C in 6 patients, who had high peripheral blood myeloblast counts, with the sensitivities of their myeloblasts to Ara-C in mice. This comparison indicates that the assay might be a useful way of predicting the response of leukaemic cells in patients to cytotoxic agents.
