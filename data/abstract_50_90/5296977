Leidy, Grace (Columbia University, New York, N.Y.), Iris Jaffee, and Hattie E. Alexander. Genetic modifiers of the phenotypic level of deoxyribonucleic acid-conferred novobiocin resistance in Haemophilus. J. Bacteriol. 92:1464-1468. 1966.-An apparent increase in novobiocin resistance in Haemophilus aegyptius after a second exposure to a particular H. influenzae transforming deoxyribonucleic acid was shown to be the result not of multi-step transformation but of the action of a gene functioning as an enhancement modifier. The modifier is very closely linked to a streptomycin resistance gene (which is linked to a novobiocin resistance marker); it affects the natural degree of resistance to both novobiocin and kanamycin to a measurable degree. Evidence of a repressor of the enhancement modifier is reported.
