The hemolytic action of the chlorine-containing pesticides, trichloroacetic acid (TCA), pentachlorophenolate (PCP), chlorophos and pentachloronitrobenzene (PCNB) on red cells was studied, as were their effects on acetylcholinesterase activity and resistance of red cells to mechanical hemolysis by ultrasound. The modifying action of pesticides on red cell membranes was shown to lead to their mechanical resistance. TCA, PCP and chlorophos were found to sensitize red cells whereas PCNB to make them resistant to the mechanical action of ultrasound. The kinetic characteristics of the structural functional disorders of red cells might be used as quantitative criteria of the efficacy of the action of pesticides on the cells.
