The effects of chloramphenicol and cyanide on the increase in UV resistance of intracellular phage T1 infecting cells of E. coli B or E. coli Bs-1 were investigated. The inhibitiors were added to the cells 3 min prior to infection and to the complexes of phage-bacteria 3.5 and 6.5 min after adsorption of phage by the cells. The data obtained are not in agreement with the suggestion that increase in UV resistance of intracellular phage is mainly due to the accumulation of phage DNA inside the host cells. It is suggested that a very important role in this resistance is played by the interaction of phage DNA with the cell membranes.
