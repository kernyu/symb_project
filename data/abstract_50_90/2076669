A total of 33 Staphylococcus hyicus-cultures from piglets with exudative epidermatitis were analyzed for the presence of antibiotic resistance plasmids. Four small plasmids encoding resistances to chloramphenicol, macrolide-lincosamide-antibiotics, streptomycin or tetracyclines could be identified in plasmid-curing and plasmid-transformation experiments. For further characterization these plasmids were digested with restriction endonucleases. This led to the construction of a specific restriction map for each of the 4 plasmids. On the basis of their restriction maps, these 4 antibiotic resistance plasmids from "porcine" S. hyicus-cultures were compared with the respective resistance plasmids of other staphylococcal species from infections of humans and animals.
