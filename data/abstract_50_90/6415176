The ability of human polymorphonuclear leucocytes (PMNs) to ingest and kill gentamicin-sensitive and resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains was studied. Strains becoming resistant to gentamicin either by laboratory training or through an R-factor were more susceptible to the phagocytic and bactericidal function of the PMNs. These results may explain previous clinical and laboratory observations indicating that gentamicin-resistant strains are less virulent.
