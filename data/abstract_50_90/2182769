A neamine-resistant mutant of Salmonella typhimurium LT2 with altered translational fidelity was isolated. The phenomenon was expressed in severe restriction of amber suppressor activity in vivo as well as in decreased misreading of poly(U) RNA in vitro. The mutation conferring resistance to neamine was mapped at 72 min on the Salmonella genetic map, where some of the ribosomal genes have already been mapped. This location indicates that the neamine-resistant phenotype as well as an altered translational fidelity could be a consequence of an alteration of the ribosomal structure.
