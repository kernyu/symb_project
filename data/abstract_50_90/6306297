The antimicrobial activity of cefmenoxime (CMX) against clinical isolated organisms was measured; CMX was more active than cefotiam and cefazolin against Escherichia coli and Haemophilus influenzae. The serum concentrations of CMX following intravenous injection of 20 mg/kg were 25.6, 10.3, 3.0 micrograms/ml at 30, 60, 120 minutes after injection, respectively. CMX was excreted 60.9% in urine within 6 hours after injection. CMX was administered clinically to 22 pediatric patients with various infections (respiratory tract infection 16 including 1 pyothorax, urinary tract infection 4, tonsillitis with sinusitis 2) at the dose of 39 approximately 96 mg/kg/day for 4 approximately 9 days, and the following satisfactory results were obtained; excellent in 11, good in 9, and poor in 2. The rate of satisfactory clinical response was 90.9%. Eosinophilia 2 cases, slight elevation of transaminase 3 cases, slight elevation of BUN 1 case and transient diarrhea 1 case were observed. But no other serious side effects were observed.
