The activities of N-formimidoyl thienamycin and azlocillin were compared with those of tobramycin, gentamicin, amikacin, and ticarcillin against 175 Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates, including 24 strains with known mechanisms of resistance to aminoglycosides. The 50% mean inhibitory concentration for azlocillin was lower than for ticarcillin, but the 90% mean inhibitory concentration was similar for both drugs. All susceptible and multidrug-resistant strains were susceptible to N-formimidoyl thienamycin.
