The activity of cefbuperazone was tested in vitro against 287 clinical isolates of Bacteroides spp. Cefbuperazone showed good activity against B. fragilis, B. vulgatus, and other Bacteroides species, comparable to that of cefoxitin. It was relatively ineffective against B. distasonis and the B. thetaiotaomicron-ovatus group and was not active against cefoxitin-resistant Bacteroides spp.
