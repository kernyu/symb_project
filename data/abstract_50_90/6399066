The mouse foot pad test has not previously been used quantitatively to discriminate between samples of Mycobacterium leprae with differing proportions of drug-resistant M. leprae. The "drug-resistant proportion test" is a simple modification of the routine mouse foot pad test. It is demonstrated to distinguish between samples of M. leprae with a tenfold difference in the proportion of dapsone-resistant M. leprae.
