The observation that Enterobacter cloacae has emerged as a cause of infection in a haematology/oncology ward prompted a prospective study over an eight-month period. Sensitivity to antibiotics, plasmid screening and typing methods were used to describe the epidemiology of the organism which was isolated from 22 patients. There was evidence of a limited amount of cross infection. No common sources were found. A large number of distinct strains were identified. E. cloacae infection was associated with prolonged profound leucopenia and broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy.
