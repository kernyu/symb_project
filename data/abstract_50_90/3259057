Anti-infectious resistance factors and microflora in the focus of inflammation have been studied over the course of chronic posttraumatic osteomyelitis in adults. This disease is associated with elevated levels of leukocytes, lymphocytes, IgG, normal or elevated levels of IgA and lysozyme in the peripheral blood. The data obtained in the immunological examination of chronic osteomyelitis patients indicate that such patients fall into two groups: with and without pronounced IgM deficiency. Changes in microbiological and immunological characteristics vary in different groups. A detailed characterization of microflora in the focus of inflammation over the course of the disease in all patients and in individual groups of patients is presented, and the dynamics of anti-infectious resistance factors is shown to reflect changes in microflora in the focus of lesion, which is manifested by changes in immunoglobulin levels corresponding to primary (the initial IgM level being normal) and secondary (a low IgM level) immune response.
