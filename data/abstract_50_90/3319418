Investigations of resistant mutants could help resolve differences and similarities in the action of azole and polyene antifungals whose modes of action are related; both disrupt membrane properties, such as permeability, by interfering with membrane sterols--polyenes by direct binding and azoles by inhibiting their synthesis. Studies of laboratory-derived mutants of Candida albicans which have an altered sterol content and/or an altered sterol composition do not provide evidence for a unified mechanism of polyene resistance. Clinical isolates of azole-resistant C. albicans have an increased or unaltered content of ergosterol and are impermeable to azoles. C. albicans 6.4, a laboratory-derived mutant resistant to both polyenes and azoles, is impermeable to azoles and has an increased content of methylated sterols. This unusual sterol composition resembles that of sensitive strains grown in the presence of azoles and may prevent polyene binding.
