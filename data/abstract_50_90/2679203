Lymphokines serve to modulate host inflammatory response by providing a communication link among cells involved in resistance to infection. In the alcoholic, this system may be impaired due to a combination of the direct effects of ethanol on immunocompetent cells and the soluble factors involved in cell-cell interactions. In this paper, we review the literature on this subject, describe an ethanol-related impairment of migration inhibitory factor activity in the rat, and present a possible mechanism for this alteration.
