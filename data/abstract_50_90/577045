Observations of erratic anthelmintic activity of fenbendazole against known standardised thiabendazole-resistant strains of Haemonchus contortus and Trichostrongylus colubriformis in sheep were investigated. Fenbendazole at a dose rate of 10 mg/kg body weight was administered by oral, intra-ruminal or intra-abomasal routes, and was most effective against both resistant strains following intra-ruminal administration. In addition thiabendazole, oxibendazole, fenbendazole, parbendazole and mebendazole plus two unrelated compounds, levamisole and morantel tartrate, were used at one and a half times their suggested or recommended therapeutic dose rate against thiabendazole-resistant strains of H contortus and T colubriformis in sheep; each drug being administered by the intra-ruminal or intra-abomasal routes. Fenbendazole was more effective against both strains following intra-ruminal administration. Parbendazole was more effective against the resistant strain of T colubriformis following intra-ruminal administration. At the dose rate chosen for the other benzimidazoles used against these resistant strains, there was no difference in anthelmintic efficacy due to route of administration. Levamisole was highly effective against both resistant strains, irrespective of the route of administration. In the groups treated with morantel tartrate, the results obtained were difficult to interpret due to mortalities and a highly variable response in the surviving sheep. Fenbendazole, thiabendazole and mebendazole when used at their suggested or recommended therapeutic dose rate in sheep, were highly effective against known thiabendazole-susceptible strains of H contortus and T colubriformis following both intra-ruminal or intra-abomasal administration.
