Conjugative transfers of drug-resistant plasmids in Shigella dysenteriae type 1 isolated from the epidemic in West Bengal were unsuccessful. The plasmids were non-transmissible in spite of having the fertility factor F, genetically labelled with kanamycin-resistant transposon Tn903 (pWS 7). A small 2.5 kb nonconjugative plasmid encoded for the streptomycin-resistant character. Cured plasmid-less strains of S. dysenteriae 1 showed resistance to sulfonamides.
