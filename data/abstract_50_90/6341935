The occurrence of Haemophilus in throat swabs from 273 hospitalized children aged 0-15 years has been investigated. Haemophilus was detected in 124 children. H. influenzae was observed in 15.7% of the children and 37.6% of the carriers. H. parainfluenzae was observed in 31.8% of the children and 70% of the carriers. The carriage rate of Haemophilus influenzae type b occurred in 6.6% of the children and was not observed in children aged less than six months. One nontypable, biotype II strain of H. influenzae (2.2%) was resistant to ampicillin and tetracycline; one biotype I, type b strain was resistant to tetracycline. Among 90 strains of H. parainfluenzae, 20 were beta-lactamase-producing strains; 80% of these strains were isolated in children aged more than two years. Beta-lactamase-producing Haemophilus was detected in 7.7% of children but only 0.36% of children were carrier of ampicillin-resistant H. influenzae. No chloramphenicol-resistant strain was isolated during this study.
