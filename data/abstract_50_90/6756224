The relationship of subtherapeutic feeding and parenteral injection of antibiotics to the presence of antibiotic resistant strains of Escherichia coli in the fecal microflora of commercial turkeys has been investigated. Cloacal swabs collected from 137 commercial turkeys were examined for E coli resistant to gentamicin. Gentamicin-resistant E coli organisms were isolated and tested for resistance to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, kanamycin, streptomycin, and tetracycline. Strains of E coli resistant to gentamicin were identified in 118 of 137 (86.1%) specimens evaluated. There were 5 different antibiotic resistance patterns exhibited by the gentamicin-resistant strains of E coli. All strains showed a common antibiotic resistance pattern of gentamicin, kanamycin, and streptomycin. The results of the antibiotic susceptibility tests were compared to the known history of antibiotic usage in each flock. There was no significant correlation between the use of subtherapeutic concentrations of antibiotics and the frequency of gentamicin resistant E coli. However, the frequency of gentamicin-resistant E coli was closely related to the age of the bird, with birds less than 12 weeks of age being most likely to harbor E coli resistant to gentamicin. This age-dependent frequency of gentamicin-resistant E coli was associated with the common practice of dipping eggs in gentamicin and injecting newly hatched poults with gentamicin, but not with the feeding of subtherapeutic concentrations of antibiotics.
