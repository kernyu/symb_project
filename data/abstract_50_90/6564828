The susceptibility to Augmentin of a total of 1,417 bacterial isolates was investigated. Augmentin is a new formulation of the broad-spectrum beta-lactam-antibiotic amoxicillin together with the beta-lactamase-inhibitor clavulanic acid. It was demonstrated that 88% of all isolates tested were sensitive to Augmentin, 9% were resistant. 88% of all Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains fell in the "resistant" category. Only 1/71 anaerobes and 15/286 staphylococci were classified as resistant to Augmentin.
