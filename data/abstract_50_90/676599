A possibility of transfer of chloramphenicol-resistance and penicillin-resistance plasmids from 4 different donor S. epidermidis strains to 2 S. aureus strains was demonstrated. Chloramphenocol-resistance plasmid was found in S. epidermidis 1065/77 which was not expressed in this strain but could be transferred to and was expressed in Staphylococcus aureus strains. Penicillin-resistance and chloramphenicol-resistance plasmids were transferred simultaneously in 40 per cent of the colonies.
