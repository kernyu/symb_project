A study of the pharmacokinetic parameters of cefotaxime (CTX) and desacetylcefotaxime (dCTX) in newborns was conducted; the former is commonly used for neonatal infections. The elimination half life of CTX correlated with gestational age (GA) and postnatal age (PNA). Elimination of dCTX was longer permitting a synergistic or additive effect with CTX against Gram-negative bacteria. CTX is indicated in the treatment of neonatal sepsis because of the increasing resistance of Escherichia coli to ampicillin and its good efficacy against group B streptococcus.
