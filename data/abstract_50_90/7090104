Staphylococcus saprophyticus has been shown to be an important uropathogen in urinary tract infections in young women. Thirty-five isolates from 27 patients with staphylococci in the prostatic fluid of men with bacterial prostatitis were evaluated for the presence of S. saprophyticus. Three patients (11 per cent) with this organism were identified by novobiocin resistance (disk diffusion test), absence of hemolysis, and coagulase. These patients tended to be younger, more symptomatic, and more responsive to appropriate antibiotic therapy than those with staphylococcus epidermidis. S. saprophyticus appears to be an important pathogen in prostatic infections.
