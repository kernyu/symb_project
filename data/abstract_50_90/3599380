Laboratory and clinical study was carried out on miconazole (MCZ), a new synthetic imidazole. The antifungal activity of MCZ was studied and expressed as MICs for clinical isolates. The drug proved to have the highest activity against Cryptococcus neoformans, with MICs of no more than 0.16 micrograms/ml for all isolates of this species. MICs of Torulopsis glabrata were 0.08-5 micrograms/ml for all isolates and those of Candida albicans and Candida tropicalis were 5-20 micrograms/ml for more than 90% of the isolates. Most of other strains were less than 10 micrograms/ml. When 3 healthy adult men were administered each with 200 mg of MCZ by intravenous drip infusion for 1.25 hours, the mean serum MCZ concentration was 1.39 micrograms/ml at the end of the infusion, then decreased rapidly to 0.49 microgram/ml in following 30 minutes, and then decreased gradually to 0.17 microgram/ml 6 hours later. The mean cumulative urinary excretion rate of the drug was as low as 3.0% at this stage. A total of 25 patients with ages of 30-78 years, comprising 17 men and 8 women, were treated with 200-1,800 mg of MCZ daily for 3-93 days. The clinical effectiveness was ascertained in 19 cases among the patients; 9 cases with candidiasis, 3 with cryptococcosis and 7 with aspergillosis. Clinical responses were excellent in 2, good in 9 and poor in 8 cases, and its efficacy rates was 58%. The efficacy rate of the combination therapy with other antifungal agents was 60% in comparison with 57% of MCZ alone. Adverse reactions to the drug such as nausea, vomiting and anorexia were observed in 3 cases (12%). Abnormal changes in laboratory parameters were also observed: 3 patients with elevations of GOT and GPT, and another with eosinophilia.
