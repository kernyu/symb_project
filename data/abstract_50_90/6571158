91 strains of Staphylococci belonging to different species were investigated for their adhesive capacity to urinary and buccal human epithelial cells. Furthermore the adherence of the same bacterial strains was evaluated in relation with their methicillin-sensitive and methicillin-resistant properties. S. aureus showed an high adhesion to buccal and urinary cells; S. saprophyticus and S. epidermidis attached mainly to uroepithelial cells and to buccal cells, respectively. Bacterial strains, either sensitive or resistant to methicillin antibiotic, did not exhibit significant differences of adhesive capacity.
