A strain of enteropathogenic Escherichia coli 0126:B16 has been isolated in fifteen children and one adult during a severe outbreak. One infant is dead. The strain produced heat-stable enterotoxin, attach to rabbit enterocytes but did not have colonization factor antigen CFA/I or CFA/II. Its hemagglutination type was the same that the E. coli H10407, CFA/I+. It presented a resistance at eight antibiotics and, with the loss of enterotoxigenicity, there was a loss of resistance at ampicillin and of the capacity to attach to enterocytes.
