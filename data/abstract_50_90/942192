The results of the study on the dynamics of changes in antibiotic sensitivity of staphylococci isolated from 38 patients with destructive pneumonia were presented. Most of the strains were characterized by multiple resistance to the main antibiotics with high resistance levels. Aminoglycosides, fusidin and rifampicin were the most active against the clinical strains. Repeated determinations of the antibiotic sensitivity revealed changes in the structure of the antibiotic resistance with inclusion of new resistance markers.
