To document the changing clinical spectrum of tuberculosis among inpatients, 498 consecutive admissions to the tuberculosis unit of West Park Hospital, Toronto between January 1977 and March 1980 were reviewed. The results were compared with those of a study at this hospital two decades earlier. The recent patients were older, had a shorter stay in hospital, were more often alcoholic and more often had nontuberculous mycobacterial pulmonary disease.
