Trospectomycin (U-63366F), a 6'-propyl analogue of spectinomycin, was tested against aminoglycoside-resistant enterococci. The MIC90 for Enterococcus faecalis was 4 mg/l and that for E. faecium was 8 mg/l. Trospectomycin alone was not bactericidal for enterococci, with MBC90 4096 mg/l for both E. faecalis and E. faecium. The addition of commercially available polyvalent immunoglobulin decreased significantly both the MICs and the MBCs and the rendered trospectomycin bactericidal for enterococci. Chequerboard titration of a combination of trospectomycin with ampicillin revealed an FIC index of 1.0 for all the isolates tested. Time-kill curves also did not show any enhancement of bactericidal activity of ampicillin when combined with trospectomycin. A combination of ampicillin and gentamicin was synergistic for enterococci under similar experimental conditions. Trospectomycin can be used as a safe alternative to aminoglycosides or beta-lactam antibiotics in enterococcal infection where bactericidal activity is not required, or in the event of serious side effects from these two classes of antibiotics.
