Some properties of 5 H2S+ strains of E. coli (labeled EC1-EC5, of which 4 isolated from the feces of subjects with gastroenteritis and 1 from a patients with cystopyelitis) has been studied. Of these, two resulted to belong to the O140 and one to the O127 serological groups; other 2 strains were found to react respectively with two (O84 and O108) and three (O65, O70 and O71) E. coli antisera. H2S- segregants were spontaneously obtained from 3 of these strans, but with different frequency: it was very low in EC5 (1.4%) and especially in EC3 (0.2%) strains, but appeared higher in EC4 (39.3%) strain. Clones from EC4 strain were also raffinose-negative; 11 of 12 obtained from EC5 strain (resistant to tetracycline) appeared sensible to tetracycline. Only one strain (EC4) has been able to transfer the H2S+ character with 4.7% frequency; another strain (EC5) transferred tetracycline-resistance character, but with lower frequency. Raffinose-positive character has never been transferred.
