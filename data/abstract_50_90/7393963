We have investigated the response of mice to halothane that have been selectively bred for either sensitivity (long sleep, LS) or resistance (short sleep, SS) to the anesthetic effects of ethanol. While large differences in the response of the animals to ethanol were observed in sleep time, blood anesthetic concentration at time of awakening, and body temperature, the SS and LS lines did not differ in their response to halothane. We conclude that the mechanism of action of ethanol and halothane differ in a significant way from each other.
