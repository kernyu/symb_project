Strains of Pseudomonas producing fluorescin but no pyocyanin or pyorubrin were studied by biochemical and antibiotic sensitivity testing. A rapid nitrate test was found to be useful in distinguishing P. aeruginosa (positive) from P. fluorescens and P. putida (both negative). A shortened gelatin test differentiated P. fluorescens (positive) from P. putida (negative). P. fluorescens and P. putida were very sensitive to low levels of kanamycin and resistant to carbenicillin, a pattern just the opposite of that obtained with P. aeruginosa.
