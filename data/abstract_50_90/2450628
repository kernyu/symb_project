High titers of interferon were found in the serum and milk of three sows treated two days after farrowing with polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid complexed with poly-L-lysine and carboxymethylcellulose, but circulating interferon was not found in the piglets suckled by these sows. When two treated sows and their suckling piglets were exposed to infection with transmissible gastroenteritis virus eight hours after treatment, the sows showed no signs of disease, although they developed circulating interferon in response to the virus infection. The piglets suckled by the treated sows developed signs of transmissible gastroenteritis which were identical to those seen in a control litter of piglets suckled by an untreated sow. Piglets treated at two days of age with the polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid complex showed a delay in onset of clinical signs when exposed to infection with transmissible gastroenteritis virus, compared with untreated control piglets. When two sows were treated with the polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid complex before farrowing, neither circulating interferon nor activated natural killer cells were found in the piglets after birth.
