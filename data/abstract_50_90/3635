Concentrations of bacteria in cerebrospinal fluid ranged from 4.5 X 10(3) to 3 X 10(8) colony-forming units/ml in 27 patients with bacterial meningitis before antibiotic therapy and from 4 X 10(1) to 1.4 X 10(6) CFU/ml in four patients after one to two days of antibiotic therapy. All patients with persistent positive cultures had pretreatment concentrations of 10(7) CFU/ml or greater. A significant association was observed between cerebrospinal fluid lactic acid dehydrogenase activity and concentrations of bacteria (p less than 0.01). Large inocula of Hemophilus influenzae type b (10(7)) increased the minimal inhibitory concentration for penicillin and ampicillin but not for chloramphenicol. The minimal inhibitory concentration of each of the three antibiotics increased when group B streptococci were assayed. These data indicate that persistence of a positive culture may be related to large initial concentrations of bacteria. The relative "resistance" in vitro of large inocula possibly contributes to this persistence. These observations are also consistent with the hypothesis that lactic acid dehydrogenase activity in cerebrospinal fluid is derived from bacteria.
