In order to evaluate effectiveness of cefoperazone (CPZ) in the treatment of bacterial infections of children, the clinical studies were carried out. CPZ was administered by one-shot injection to 28 patients at daily dose of 50 approximately 160 (average 89.7) mg/kg in 3 approximately 4 divided dose for 2 approximately 10 (average 5.6) days. The overall efficacy rate in 28 cases was 92.9%, i.e., excellent in 16 (57.1%), good in 10 (35.7%), fair in 1 (3.6%) and poor in 1 case (3.6%). Temporary rise of GOT and GPT or only GOT was observed in each 1 case out of 28 cases (7.1%), but any other abnormality was not observed throughout this series. Based on the above results, CPZ was thus considered to be a useful antibiotic in treatment of pediatric infections caused by Gram-positive cocci and Gram-negative rods.
