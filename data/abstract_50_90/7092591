Reparative and protective properties of the high frequency ultrasound (880 kgHz, 0.4--0.6 W/cm2) have been studied in the experiment performed on rabbits before and after actinomycin D administration (0.2-1.2 mg/kg). RNA and total protein contents have been estimated in cytoplasm of ganglionic cells and in nuclei of photoreceptors. A positive effect of the ultrasound on actinomycin D-induced disorders in metabolic processes of the retina are proved to be weakly manifested. If the antibiotic is used in low concentrations, its inhibiting action can be eliminated or reduced with a subsequent ultrasound treatment of the eye. Simultaneous administration of the ultrasound and increased concentrations of actinomycin D enhances considerably development of certain degenerative changes in the retina. Preliminary ultrasound treatment (especially repeated) of the eye increases metabolic resistivity of retinal cells against the damaging effect of actinomycin D. It is manifested in less amount of cytochemical disorders, and when the inhibitor is applied in small doses-in their absence.
