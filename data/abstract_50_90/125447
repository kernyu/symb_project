Sixty-eight methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains were isolated from mastitis milk samples originating from 20 Belgian dairyherds. All these strains appeared to be representatives of one single strain which was probably of human origin. Evidence is presented indicating a rapid in vivo evolutionary change in this strain. The following characteristics were found to be variable: the production of beta haemolysin inversely connected with fibrinolysin (staphylokinase) activity; the production of lipase, enterotoxin B and delta haemolysin; the resistance to neomycin, chloramphenicol, tetracyclines, methicillin and spectinomycin associated with constitutive or inducible macrolide resistance.
