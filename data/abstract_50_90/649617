The behavior of ribosomes derived from EmtR X EmtS hybrid cells in in vitro protein synthesis is similar to that observed with a 1:1 mixture of ribosomes from EmtR and EmtS cells. When mRNA (BM virus RNA) is present in limiting amounts (RNA/ribosome molar ratio = 0.1), protein synthesis in either mixture is sensitive to emetine. In contrast, when mRNA is present in excess (RNA/ribosome molar ratio = 2), the emetine resistant as well as the sensitive components are both expressed in the mixtures. These results strongly indicate that emetine resistant and sensitive ribosomes are present in the hybrid cells in about equal amounts and that the dominance of emetine sensitivity is best explained by assuming that emetine acts by blocking ribosome movement along mRNA by inhibiting the translocation step. The observed time lag in the expression of EmtRI and EmtRII mutations following mutagenesis is consistent with the above hypothesis for the mechanism of action of emetine.
