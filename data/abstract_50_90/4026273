The cellular slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum is normally susceptible to the action of the polyene antibiotic nystatin. We describe conditions under which transient nystatin resistance can be induced in the absence of detectable changes in sterol composition. These results suggest that nystatin plays a positive role in promoting resistance to itself.
