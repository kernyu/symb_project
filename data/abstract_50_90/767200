Mitochondrial mutants of yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae XII race resistant to erythromycin, neomycin and monomycin were used in the experiments. It is found that there are mitochondrial mutants resistant to antibiotics at 30 degrees C, but sensitive at 37 degrees C. In most cases the sensitivity to antibiotics was accompanied by a loss of the ability to growth on non-fermental carbon sources at the elevated temperature (37 degrees C). The genetic analysis revealed the extra-chromosomal inheritance of the markers. Probable interpretation of this phenomenon is discussed.
