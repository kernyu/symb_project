Sensitivity of the tularemia causative agent of different geographical races to antibiotics such as streptomycin, tetracycline, gentamicin, rifampicin (20 strains), ampicillin, polymyxin M, erythromycin, oleandomycin (361 strains) and lincomycin (294 strains) was studied. High sensitivity of the tularemi a microbe to streptomycin, tetracycline, rifampicin (MIC of 10 gamma/ml), gentamicin (MIC of 1 gamma/ml) and resistance to 50 gamma of ampicillin and 1000 gamma/ml of polymyxin M were found. Combined use of 50 gamma of ampicillin and 100 gamma/ml of polymyxin M added to the nutrient medium for growth inhibition of the foreign flora on isolation of the tularemia causative agent from the infected material including stable laboratory animal carcases was recommended. Marked differences in sensitivity of the strains of different geographical races to the macrolides and lincomycin were observed. The strains of the non-Arctic and Central Asiatic races were of low resistance to the above drugs (the MIC of erythromycin, oleandomycin and lincomycin were 10--50, 50--400 and 25--100 gamma/ml respectively. Within the holarctic race 40 per cent were low resistant and 60 per cent were highly resistant to these drugs. The above drugs should not be used for treatment of tularemia cases.
