The circadian rhythms of oxygen consumption and insecticide sensitivity (to dichlorvos, a rapid-acting organophosphate) in adult confused flour beetles (Tribolium confusum du Val) were determined using a LD 12:12 lighting regimen and other standardized conditions. Analysis included fitting a 24 h cosine curve to the data to estimate rhythm characteristics. Relationships between rhythms in oxygen consumption and insecticide sensitivity were evaluated on the basis of each rhythm's acrophase (timing of high point). The acrophase of oxygen consumption occurred on the average about 3 h after the middle of the daily dark span. Maximum insecticide sensitivity, based upon the reciprocal of the LC70, occurred about 2 h earlier. Although the times are fairly close, the difference between the two acrophases was statistically significant.
