The colicin typing method for differentiating epidemic strains of Shigella sonnei was evaluated. Forty percent of the strains were untypable, but the method divides 60% of the strains into 15 established colicin types. The method has reasonably good reproducibility, but should not be interpreted with the same degree of confidence as some other characteristics such as serotypes. For this reason, known type strains should be included as controls in each analysis to ensure uniformity of results.
