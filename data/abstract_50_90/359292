In a 500-bed general hospital the incidence of highly resistant strains of Klebsiella pneumonia was examined. About 20% of examined patients in the surgical and medical departments were carriers. Spread of the organism was via the hands of personnel and patients as well as various objects. The use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, especially ampicillin and cefalotin is thought to be the chief cause of the high incidence of Klebsiella emergence. About 90% of carriers had previously received antibiotics.
