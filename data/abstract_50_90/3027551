A new IncQ plasmid R89S has been analysed by molecular-genetic methods. A restriction map of this plasmid has been constructed and regions of homology with the plasmid RSF1010 have been identified. A genetic map of the plasmid R89S has been prepared based on the deletion and insertion plasmid derivatives. The phenotypic analysis of the derivatives has identified the location of genes coding for replication, incompatibility, mobilization for genetic transfer and resistance to streptomycin in the genome of R89S.
