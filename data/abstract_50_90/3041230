The spread of antibiotic resistance in Gram-negative bacteria has sustained a continuing search for new agents with antibacterial activity against this important class of bacterial pathogen. Because the biosynthesis of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is unique to Gram-negative bacteria and required by them for growth and virulence, attempts have been made to discover or design antibacterial agents acting at this site; however, no such agents have so far been developed. We now present definitive experimental data documenting design of the first member of the class of antibacterial compounds which specifically inhibit LPS synthesis. The target enzyme is 3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonate cytidylytransferase (CMP-KDO synthetase), a cytoplasmic enzyme which activates 3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonate (KDO) for incorporation into LPS. A specific inhibitor of CMP-KDO synthetase, alpha-C-(1,5-anhydro-7-amino-2,7-dideoxy-D-manno-heptopyranosyl)-carboxy late was designed using results of our studies of the purified enzyme. LPS synthesis ceased and lipid A precursor accumulated, causing growth stasis and perturbation of outer membrane structure and function, following delivery of the inhibitor to the intracellular target by a peptide carrier. Antibacterial action required an intact oligopeptide permease system and specific intracellular aminopeptidase activity to release inhibitor from the peptide prodrug.
