Pseudomonas sp. TA8 isolated by m-toluate enrichment from an aqueous sample metabolized toluene and m- and p-xylenes via the meta cleavage pathway, and manifested specific resistance to streptomycin and sulfonamides. A variety of experiments revealed that the pKJ1 plasmid of about 150 megadaltons carried by TA8 specified both the toluene and xylene degradative function (the Tol function) and streptomycin/sulfonamide resistance. The deletion of a segment of pKJ1 (about 22 megadaltons) resulted in the loss of the Tol function. pKJ1 was not assigned to Pseudomonas incompatibility group P-1, P-2, P-3, or P-9.
