Cephotaxime (HR 756) is a new cephalosporin antibiotic of wide spectrum and extraordinary activity, suitable for parenteral administration. It is highly resistant to the beta-lactamases of Gram negative bacilli, being thus especially active against microorganisms such as indole-positive Proteus, Serratia marcencens, and others usually resistant to most beta-lactamic antibiotics because of their ability to produce beta-lactamases of high activity. The sensitivity of 355 different bacterial strains to cephotaxime has been determined by the disc method, along with the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the drug to the same strains, and regression lines have been constructed. The extraordinary activity of cephotaxime against Enterobacteriaceae, Vibrio Cholerae, Haemophilus, and Neisseria meningitidis is noteworthy. Of the 220 strains of Enterobacteriaceae studied, 55% produced beta-lactamase. The MIC of cephotaxime for beta-lactamase forming strains was similar to that for non-forming strains.
