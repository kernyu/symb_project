Mice were infected intravenously with a streptomycin (SM)-dependent strain of tubercle bacilli which had been starved of the antibiotic. The inoculum persisted in the spleen for a fairly long period, especially keeping almost the initial level of viable counts in the first few weeks. Isoniazid (INH) administration exerted little effect on such fate of the infection at a bactericidal dose to the same strain multiplying under the supply of SM. Rifampicin (RFP) was, however, highly effective in either case. Similar results were obtained in the corresponding in vitro experiments. The data suggest that this animal model is a convenient system for screening drugs effective on the dormant tuberculous infection.
