The in vitro activity of four oral cephalosporins was assessed in dilution tests with 50 isolates of the family Enterobacteriaceae possessing well-characterized mechanisms of resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics. The interaction of the drugs with a broad array of beta-lactamases was also determined in spectrophotometric assays and tests for enzyme induction. Overall, the percentages of strains susceptible to each of the study drugs were 82% for cefixime, 62% for cefuroxime, 58% for cephalexin, and 44% for cefaclor. The poor activity of the older cephalosporins was due to a high degree of susceptibility to hydrolysis by both plasmid-mediated and chromosomally mediated beta-lactamases. For cefaclor, higher MICs were associated with higher levels of plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases in the strains. Resistance to cefuroxime was seen primarily among strains expressing high levels of class I or IV beta-lactamase. Resistance to cefixime was seen only among strains expressing high levels of class I enzymes. Neither cefixime nor cefuroxime was a strong inducer of class I beta-lactamases, although enzyme induction did appear to play a role in cefuroxime resistance in a strain of Serratia marcescens. The consistently greater activity of cefixime over cefuroxime was found not to be due to greater drug permeation into the cell. Rather, it appeared to result from the high affinity of the drug for target enzymes.
