Human fibroblast cells remain primed for IFN-beta 1 synthesis for at least 18 days after the removal of IFN-beta 1, to the same extent as cells primed shortly before induction. The maximal effect of priming is observed in cells that are treated with IFN at low cell density and are subsequently allowed to undergo several divisions. This observation suggests that the information for priming is propagated from cell to cell upon cell division. A diminished priming effect is observed after cells undergo more than three divisions in culture, suggesting a dilution of the mediator responsible for the transmission of the effect. It was not possible to demonstrate intercellular communication of the priming effect by a mediator found in the medium or by cell to cell contact. Observation that priming persists in cells for 18 days in the absence of detectable levels of IFN in the medium, but virus-resistance declines after three days supports the previous suggestion for different mechanisms involved in these two IFN-induced phenomena.
