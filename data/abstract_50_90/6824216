The effect of tylosin on macrolide resistance of gram-positive bacteria of pigs was determined. After an initial base-line period during which the pigs were given antibiotic-free feed, 1 group of 8 pigs was given tylosin feed (100 g/US ton of feed), and a 2nd group of 7 was given antibiotic-free feed. Samples were taken at 2- to 3-week intervals. For each pig, rectal, skin, and nasal swab samples were collected for enumeration of fecal streptococci and skin and nasal staphylococci. Percentages of macrolide resistant organisms of each group were tabulated on the basis of colony counts from antibiotic free and erythromycin-containing plates. After the introduction of tylosin into the feed of 1 group, a clear difference between the 2 groups with respect to the macrolide resistance of their gram-positive microflora was observed. The data indicate that tylosin feeding results in an increase in macrolide resistance of the bacterial flora of pigs.
