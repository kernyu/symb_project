The overall sensitivity pattern of the three main urinary pathogens to the commonly used oral antibodies exceeded 80 percent. The incidence of multiple resistant Escherichia coli was 8 percent. The resistant patterns of the sewage E. coli resembled that of the resistant urinary E. coli. However only one-third of the resistant urinary E. coli showed multiple resistance whereas two-thirds of the resistant E. coli in the sewage showed this feature. The resistance transfer was low in organisms isolated from the sewage. Regular surveillance of this type may be useful as a guide to therapy and may reflect the impact of continued antibiotic usage in the community.
