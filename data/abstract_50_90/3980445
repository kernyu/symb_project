An efficient polyethylene glycol-assisted method for transformation of Brevibacterium lactofermentum protoplasts that uses plasmid vectors has been developed. Two small plasmids, pUL330 (5.2 kilobases) and pUL340 (5.8 kilobases), both containing the kanamycin resistance gene from transposon Tn5 and the replication origin of the natural plasmid pBL1 of B. lactofermentum, were selected as vectors. Supercoiled forms of the plasmids yielded a 100-fold higher transformation frequency than did linear forms. The optimal transformation frequency was achieved with 10 ng of DNA in 1 ml of transformation buffer. Higher concentrations of plasmid DNA resulted in a decrease in transformation frequency per microgram of DNA. Optimal transformation was obtained with 25 to 35% polyethylene glycol 6000. Under optimal conditions, 10(6) transformants per microgram of DNA were obtained.
