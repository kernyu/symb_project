We identified two beta-lactamase-positive enterococci. One strain was high-level (MIC, greater than 2,000 microgram/ml) gentamicin resistant; the other was not (MIC, 12.5 microgram/ml). beta-Lactamase production was extrachromosomally mediated in both strains, and both strains showed an inoculum effect reversed by beta-lactamase inhibitors. The strain lacking high-level gentamicin resistance showed synergistic killing with a combination of penicillin, clavulanic acid, and gentamicin.
