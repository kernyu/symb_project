A modified automated method that uses the MS-2 system (Abbott Laboratories, Diagnostics Div., Irving, Tex.) to verify the reaction of coagulase-negative staphylococci to novobiocin is described. This technique permits the testing of a great number of specimens in an average time of 99 min and results in a 100% match with the traditional method of culturing.
