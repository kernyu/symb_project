Although a latex agglutination test (StaphAurex) and a hemagglutination test (Staphyloslide) correctly identified all strains of Staphylococcus aureus that were susceptible or had intermediate susceptibility to oxacillin, 17 of 73 (23%) and 18 of 73 (25%) strains of oxacillin-resistant S. aureus were not identified by StaphAurex and Staphyloslide, respectively. All strains not detected were resistant to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and rifampin.
