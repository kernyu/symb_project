2273 Salmonella strains received from veterinary laboratories in the Federal Republic of Germany including Berlin (West) in 1972 were examined for their resistance against tetracyclines, ampicillin, chloramphenicol, kanamycin, nitrofurazone, and furazolidone. 13.3% of the strains studied were found to be resistant to one or more of these antibacterial substances. The proportion of resistant strains was 37.5% for S. typhimurium (excluding var. copenhagen), 3.1% for S. typhimurium var. copenhagen and 57% for S. panama. 79.8% of resistant strains were found to belong to these types. From 303 resistant strains found, resistance determinants were present in 87.4% to tetracyclines, in 37.2% to ampicillin, in 15.8% to chloramphenicol, in 4.6% to kanamycin, in 0.9% to furazolidone, and in 1.3% to nitrofurazone. 16 combinations of resistance determinants were found to occur 95.0% of strains transmitted resistance to E. coli K-12. A transmission of resistance determinants to furazolidone and nitrofurazone could not be demonstrated. Resistance patterns differed considerably from one serotype to another.
