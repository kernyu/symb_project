A fifth cytoplasmic mutation (capr 1) obtained in Podospora anserina is described. In addition to chloramphenicol resistance it confers a strong deficiency in cytochrome aa3 and impairs the germination of ascospores. Genetic analysis shows: 1) strict maternal inheritance of (capr 1) allele; 2) selection against the (capr 1) allele as well in sexual crosses as during vegetative growth; 3) complete reversion of this selection by even low concentration of CAP. On the basis of their cytoplasmic inheritance and altered cytochrome spectra the five cytoplasmic mutations are assumed to be mitochondrial. Analysis of crosses between them allows to class them in 3 loci, 2 of which being closely linked.
