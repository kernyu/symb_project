The antibacterial efficacies of 4 antibiotics with different modes of action against a penicillin-tolerant and a non-tolerant strain of Staphylococcus aureus were investigated. For the in vitro studies the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and the minimum bacterial concentration (MBC) were determined and short-term growth experiments at different antibiotic concentrations were performed. For the in vivo studies, antibacterial efficacy in an experimental infection in normal and granulocytopenic mice was evaluated. For erythromycin, rifampicin and ciprofloxacin, there was no difference in the MIC and MBC values for the 2 strains. Benzylpenicillin had an MBC value for the tolerant strains which was 256 times higher than the MIC; with the non-tolerant strain there was no difference. EC50 values, calculated from the in vitro short-term growth curves, gave similar results. Only benzylpenicillin exhibited a difference in activity against the tolerant strain, as reflected by the EC50 that was 290 times the EC50 for the non-tolerant strain. Studies in normal and granulocytopenic mice gave similar results: benzylpenicillin was 268 times less active against the tolerant strain than against the non-tolerant strain. Erythromycin, rifampicin and ciprofloxacin were 2-3 times less active against the tolerant strain than against the non-tolerant strain. The presence of granulocytes is important for the antibacterial effect of all antibiotics studied, since in the absence of granulocytes higher doses of the antibiotics are needed in order to obtain the same antibacterial effect as when granulocytes are present.
