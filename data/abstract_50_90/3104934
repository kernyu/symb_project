In the dressings for dry tooth sockets, mannitol and sorbitol as solid hydrophilizers have been applied. Increase of concentrations of these hydrophilizers in the tablets results in dressings with increased swelling ability and pharmaceutical availability but decreased viscosity and resistance to washing out. These properties of the dressings are also influenced by medicinal substances present. The dressing fills the tooth socket within several min, removes pain and remain there for 24-48 h.
