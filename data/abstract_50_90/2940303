This study compared teicoplanin with vancomycin without and with gentamicin and/or rifampin for treatment of experimental endocarditis due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis. In rabbits treated for three days and killed 12 hr after the last doses of antimicrobial agents, no significant difference in reducing bacterial titers of vegetations was detected between vancomycin and teicoplanin without and with gentamicin and/or rifampin. Addition of gentamicin and/or rifampin to vancomycin or teicoplanin significantly reduced bacterial titers of vegetations compared with vancomycin or teicoplanin alone. Addition of rifampin alone or gentamicin plus rifampin was significantly more effective than addition of gentamicin alone. In rabbits treated for three days and killed seven days after the last doses of antimicrobial agents, no significant difference in sterilizing vegetations was detected between vancomycin and teicoplanin with gentamicin and/or rifampin. However, there was a trend (probably due to the longer elimination half-life of teicoplanin in serum) that clearly favored teicoplanin over vancomycin. Teicoplanin plus rifampin without or with gentamicin is at least as effective as vancomycin plus rifampin without or with gentamicin for treatment of experimental endocarditis due to methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis.
