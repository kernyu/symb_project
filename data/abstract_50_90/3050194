Bacteriological studies and clinical evaluations of ceftizoxime (CZX) in perinatal period were carried out, and results are summarised as follows: Antibacterial activities of CZX in amniotic fluid were determined using the broth dilution method, and bactericidal effect on Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli were demonstrated. The bactericidal effect of CZX increased in amniotic fluid and remarkable increases of activities against resistant strains were demonstrated. The penetration of CZX into mother's milk was low, and it was speculated that the drug transfer to the newborn through breast feeding was very little. Clinically, CZX was effective in the treatment of perinatal infections without any side effect. The above results has demonstrated that CZX is a clinically useful antibiotic for the prophylaxis and the treatment of perinatal infections.
