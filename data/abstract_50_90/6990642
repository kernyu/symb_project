Nalidixic acid (Nal) can kill Candida albicans directly or suppress the organism's recovery from ultraviolet irradiation. Mutants selected for resistance to inactivation by Nal alone have generally enhanced DNA repair proficiencies evidenced by their coincident increased resistances to ultraviolet radiation, ethylmethane sulfonate, and nitrous acid. The effects of Nal, erythromycin, and inhibitors of oxidative phosphorylation on survivals of mutant and wild type strains following ultraviolet exposure indicate that different mechanisms underly the direct lethality of Nal and its ability to inhibit post-irradiation recovery.
