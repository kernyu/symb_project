The antibacterial activity of the new penem compound HRE 664 was evaluated in 451 clinical isolates, including ampicillin-resistant members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, Acinetobacter spp., Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, and beta-hemolytic streptococci, and compared with those of piperacillin, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, aztreonam, imipenem, and the penem compound Sch 34343. The new agent HRE 664 exhibited antibacterial activity comparable to that of the penem Sch 34343 and imipenem. The MICs of the new agent HRE 664 for 90% of the strains tested ranged from 1 to 4 micrograms/ml against Enterobacteriaceae and were 0.06 micrograms/ml for Staphylococcus aureus and 0.125 micrograms/ml for beta-hemolytic streptococci.
