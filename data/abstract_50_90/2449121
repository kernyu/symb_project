Incubation of streptomycin-resistant (rpsL) mutants of Salmonella typhimurium in alkaline nutrient medium containing streptomycin brought about an inhibition of cell growth that was readily reversed by removing the antibiotic or neutralizing the medium. Growth inhibition was maximal at pH 8.2 and a streptomycin concentration of 800 micrograms/ml. A similar amount of dihydrostreptomycin had a negligible effect, and 10-times-higher concentrations of this antibiotic were required to reproduce the streptomycin action. Addition of streptomycin (400 micrograms/ml) to rpsL cells in alkaline (pH 8.2) nutrient medium caused inhibition of protein and DNA synthesis and also, but to a lower degree, of RNA synthesis. This effect on macromolecular synthesis was not due to ATP deprivation, since ATP content rose after addition of the antibiotic. At pH 8.2, the rate of entrance of streptomycin increased fourfold with respect to the rate at pH 7.0, leading to a large accumulation of streptomycin into rpsL cells. Uptake of the antibiotic was halted by addition of KCN or chloramphenicol. Equal uptake was obtained with 800 micrograms of dihydrostreptomycin or 400 micrograms of streptomycin per ml, yet the former did not affect cell growth at that concentration. It is concluded that high pH stimulates streptomycin and dihydrostreptomycin uptake by rpsL strains but only streptomycin accumulation causes growth inhibition in cells lacking the high-affinity ribosomal site.
