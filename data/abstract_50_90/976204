In course of studies for the chronic toxicity of estrogens after oral application two parameters of the unspecific resistance - complement (CH50U and CB50U) and lysozyme - in sera of 30 beagle-dogs were studied. The doses of the daily (over 6 months) applicated hormones were 1,0 mg/kg ethinylostradiol and 1,0, 0,1 and 0,01 mg/kg ethinylostradiolsulfonate (depotform). In the majority of all measurements no significant variations of serum complement and -lysozyme could be detected, however after application of high doses of the hormone ethinylostradiol a little reduction of complement and significant elevations of lysozyme were observed.
