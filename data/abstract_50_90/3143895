Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) has been shown to have immunoregulatory properties and is able to modulate resistance to several microbial infections. This study was designed to determine the efficacy of IFN-gamma treatment in a mouse model of infection that simulates many clinical conditions associated with surgical wound infection: viz, a bacteria laden suture and tissue injury. The test bacteria were Klebsiella pneumoniae. Groups of CBA/J mice received either IFN-gamma or RPMI-1640 medium (controls) subcutaneously. IFN-gamma was administered daily at a dose of 7500 units for 5 days prior to bacterial challenge. Mice treated with IFN-gamma survived significantly longer than controls. Systemic bacterial recovery was significantly reduced in the IFN-gamma treated group but local bacterial recovery was unaffected.
