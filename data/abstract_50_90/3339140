During 1 year of continuous suppressive therapy for frequent recurrent genital herpes, about 44% of patients taking 400 mg acyclovir twice a day had no recurrences and 4% of patients taking placebo had no recurrences (i.e., fewer patients taking acyclovir had recurrences, and when they did there were fewer recurrences). Toxicity of continuous suppressive acyclovir treatment appears to be minimal, and viral resistance developing to the drug during use of suppressive therapy has not been a problem, although it does occur. Patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome with recurrent herpes may be given 400 mg acyclovir five times a day for 5 days or until the eruption clears and then 400 mg three times a day for 1 or 2 months followed by 400 mg twice a day thereafter. Herpes zoster of immunocompromised patients, including patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, may be treated with 800 mg oral acyclovir five or six times a day for 5 to 10 days depending on the response, and they may derive additional benefit from concomitant topical acyclovir.
