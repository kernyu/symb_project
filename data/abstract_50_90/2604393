A plasmid transformation system was developed for Bacillus polymyxa ATCC 12321 and derivatives of this strain. The method utilizes a penicillin-treated-cell technique to facilitate uptake of the plasmid DNA. Low-frequency transformation (10(-6) per recipient cell) of plasmids pC194, pBD64, and pBC16 was accomplished with this method. Selection for the transformants was accomplished on both hypertonic and nonhypertonic selective media, with the highest rates of recovery occurring on a peptone-glucose-yeast extract medium containing 0.25 M sucrose. Several additional plasmids were shown to be capable of transferring their antibiotic resistance phenotypes to B. polymyxa through the use of a protoplast transformation procedure which allowed for a more efficient transfer of the plasmid DNA. However, cell walls could not be regenerated on the transformed protoplasts, and the transformants could not be subcultured from the original selective media.
