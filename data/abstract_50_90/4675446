The herpesvirus of turkeys remains associated with cells attached to the culture vessel throughout its growth cycle. The level of infectious centers is essentially constant between 24 and 48 hr when the culture medium is unchanged. Thereafter, the number of infectious centers decreases. The cessation of virus synthesis is not due to insufficient numbers of uninfected cells or interferon production. Herpesvirus of turkeys does not replicate at 22 C and is similar to other herpesviruses in its sensitivity to interferon. The results define conditions to be considered in the preparation of infected cell suspensions commonly used as a vaccine against Marek's disease virus.
