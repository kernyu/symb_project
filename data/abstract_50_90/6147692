The malaria infection rates in non-immune residents of Dar es Salaam on various chemoprophylactic regimens were compared with that (37.1%) in those not taking prophylactic antimalarials. Among 647 people resident in Dar es Salaam for 1-6 years the two groups with the lowest infection rates by person-episodes (2.0% and 1.5%) were those taking proguanil 200 mg daily alone or with chloroquine base 300 mg weekly. Infection rates (16.9% and 14.0%) were also significantly lower than in the no-prophylaxis group in those taking chloroquine base 300 mg weekly combined with 'Fansidar', 'Maloprim' (each one tablet weekly), or proguanil 100 mg daily. No significant reduction in the malaria attack rate was found in those taking chloroquine base 300 mg or 600 mg weekly (31.2%), pyrimethamine 25 mg weekly (27.3%), proguanil 100 mg daily (46.4%), maloprim one tablet weekly (40.4%), or a combination of chloroquine base 300 mg weekly and pyrimethamine 25 mg weekly (27.1%). Similar results were obtained when the infection rates per year of exposure were compared. Proguanil was associated with fewest user complaints and fansidar with most.
