An analysis of observation of 102 patients with gastric cancer has shown the application of anabolic steroid drugs in combination with plastic and energetic substrates, vitamins and biostimulators to result in increased indices of non-specific resistance in the preoperative period. The operative trauma against this background results in considerably less depression of resistance mechanisms than in the group of patients with the traditional preoperative management. It is followed by a less amount of early complications and lethality after operation.
