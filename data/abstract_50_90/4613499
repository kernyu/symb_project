This review of progress in malaria research over the periods 1951-1970 and 1970-1973 indicates the results so far achieved in research on the parasite, on the immune response of the host, and on the vector; refers to the means of controlling or eradicating malaria that have been developed in recent years; and outlines the present status of the malaria control and eradication programme. Although impressive results have already been achieved in malaria research, more systematization and concentration of efforts are required if real breakthroughs are to be made. The experience gained in this respect is discussed.
