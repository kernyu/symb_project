The penicillinase plasmids, a series of extrachromosomal resistance factors in Staphylococcus aureus, were found to carry determinants of resistance to a series of inorganic ions as well as resistance to penicillin and, in some cases, erythromycin. Most of the ions involved were inhibitory but not lethal to the bacteria; the resistance markers conferred an increase in resistance by comparison with susceptible organisms of between 3- and 100-fold, depending on the ion involved. Separate genetic loci for resistance to arsenate, arsenite, lead, cadmium, mercuric, and bismuth ions were demonstrated. Resistance to antimony and resistance to zinc were also found but were not separated genetically from resistance to arsenite and cadmium, respectively. The ion resistance markers appeared to form a cluster on the plasmid, with no other known marker within it. Naturally occurring plasmids were observed that lacked one or more of these ion resistance markers, as well as penicillinase-negative strains that were resistant to one or more of the ions. The patterns of markers carried by these various strains may provide some understanding of the evolution of a plasmid linkage group.
