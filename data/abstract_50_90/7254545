In basic pharmacological studies, sodium cefoxitin has proved to possess the following features: a broad action spectrum, resistance to bacterial beta-lactamase, activity against anaerobic species, rapid distribution, rapid serum and bile concentration, rapid, elevated excretion in the urine in active form, and low local and general toxicity. Patients in an Emergency Surgery Department often present the following conditions: highly compromised general situation, serious, often polymicrobic sepsis with aerobic and anaerobic flora, prior treatment without result with various cycles of chemo-antibiotic treatment. The theoretical conditions therefore exist to assess the effectiveness of sodium cefoxitin in patients admitted to an emergency surgery department and presenting serious post-surgical or post-traumatic sepsis, or sepsis due to pathology that can be corrected surgically. A study of 14 patients (3 g i.v. or i.m. for 6 days) showed 71% complete cure, 21% definite improvements and one death (treatment commenced 36 hours prior to death). It is therefore maintained that sodium cefoxitin is particularly indicated as first-choice antibiotic in emergency surgery situations.
