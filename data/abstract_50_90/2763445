Electronic measurements of the motility of third stage larvae of a susceptible and a levamisole/benzimidazole-resistant strain of Haemonchus contortus were made after incubation in solutions of anthelmintics for 24 h. Results confirmed the resistance to benzimidazoles, but failed to show differences in response to levamisole. Visual observations of paralysis of first and third stage larvae in solutions of levamisole also failed to show significant differences between the two strains. The tests as conducted failed to demonstrate levamisole resistance, suggesting that nematode strains may vary in their mechanisms of resistance to levamisole.
