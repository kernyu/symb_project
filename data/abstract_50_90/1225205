The morphology of the colonies of Staph. aureus sensitive and resistant to antibiotics and the colonies with artificial resistance to benzylpenicillin, ampicillin, oxacillin, methicillin, cephaloridin and lincomycin was studied with the method of slanting light. Changes in the morphology of the colonies were most pronounced at the beginning of the microbial resistance development first of all in the cultures of Staph. aureus resistant to cephaloridin and lincomycin.
