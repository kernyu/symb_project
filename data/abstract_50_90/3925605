One hundred and sixty strains of N. gonorrhoeae were studied for their in-vitro sensitivity to six different antimicrobial agents and tested for beta-lactamase production in Zaria, Northern Nigeria. While 82% of strains were sensitive to erythromycin, 70% to tetracycline and 61% to chloramphenicol, only 35%, 33% and 24% were sensitive to ampicillin, penicillin and streptomycin respectively. Penicillin is no more the drug of choice in the treatment of gonorrhoea in this environment since two thirds of strains are either partially resistant or completely resistant to penicillin and 44% of strains are beta-lactamase producers. Erythromycin/tetracycline are recommended as the drugs of choice.
