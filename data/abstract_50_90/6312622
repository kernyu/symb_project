Seven different Chinese hamster cell lines were found to vary greatly in their sensitivity to inhibitors of the mitochondrial ATPase. In plating-efficiency experiments, Chinese hamster lung V79 and bone marrow M3-1 cells were approximately 10,000-fold more resistant to oligomycin, 100-fold more resistant to efrapeptin, and 10-fold more resistant to ossamycin and leucinostatin than were ovary CHO or peritoneal B14 cells. In vitro experiments indicated that the increased resistance of V79 versus CHO cells to these inhibitors was due to an increased resistance of the mitochondrial ATPase. Heat-inactivation experiments indicated that there was a difference in the structure of the mitochondrial ATPase of V79 and CHO cells. Genetic experiments indicated that the difference in the sensitivity of V79 and CHO cells to inhibitors of the ATPase and the difference in the structure of the mitochondrial ATPase of V79 and CHO cells was due to a difference in both a nuclear and a cytoplasmic gene.
