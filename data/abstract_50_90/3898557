Faecal samples from 60 red deer (Cervus elaphus), 13 roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), 7 chamois (Rupicapra rupicapra), 41 alpine marmot (Marmota marmota) and soils mixed with deer faeces from the Stelvio National Park were examined for Campylobacter sp. and Salmonella sp. with negative results. The same material, especially deer faeces, was a habitat highly suitable for Yersinia sp.: Y. enterocolitica (two biotypes) was isolated twice, Y. kristensenii (two serotypes) was isolated 19 times, Y. frederiksenii and Y. intermedia were isolated once. Antibiotic-resistant Escherichia coli were isolated from 16 specimens from wild ruminants, one from marmot and two from feeding places.
