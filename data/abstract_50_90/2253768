All-D-magainin-2 was synthesized to corroborate experimentally the notion that the biological function of a surface-active peptide stems primarily from its unique amphiphilic alpha-helical structure. Indeed, the peptide exhibited antibacterial potency nearly identical to that of the all-L-enantiomer. Being highly resistant to proteolysis and non-hemolytic all-D-magainin might have considerable therapeutic importance.
