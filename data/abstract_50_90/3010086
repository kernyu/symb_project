After a discussion of the principles of antiviral chemotherapy, treatment and chemoprophylaxis of the following virus infections are reviewed in detail: the various manifestations of herpes simplex virus infections, varicella-zoster, cytomegalovirus infections, Epstein-Barr virus infections, laryngeal papillomas, and influenza A. Special reference is made to the treatment of immunocompromized patients. Acycloguanosine (acyclovir) has been found particularly useful in the treatment of herpes simplex virus and varicella zoster virus infections in immunocompromized patients and for herpesencephalitis. Varicella-zoster can also be treated effectively with bromovinyldeoxyuridine (BVDU). Toxicity of the currently used antiviral drugs is discussed as well as the problem of drug resistance.
