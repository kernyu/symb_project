Recent double-blind controlled studies show that the application of a neomycin-bacitracin-polymyxin preparation reduces the incidence of staphylococcal and streptococcal infection of minor skin trauma. Allergic sensitization to neomycin is rare. Systemic side effects occur only with improper massive exposure. Resistant strains have appeared only in "closed populations." It is concluded that topical antibiotic combinations are safe and effective.
