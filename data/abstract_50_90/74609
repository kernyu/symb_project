Mixtures of drug-resistant and sensitive forms of Plasmodium chabaudi were used to infect mice, and the resulting infections were maintained in the absence of drug. Both chloroquine-resistant and pyrimethamine-resistant mutans were able to survive in such mixed infections. The results of experiments on chloroquine resistance indicated an apparent selective advantage of the resistant over the sensitive form.
