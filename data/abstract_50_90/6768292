Characteristics of gentamicin resistance were studied in gram-negative bacilli from 50 consecutive patients with nosocomial infection, during a time when gentamicin resistance had recently become prevalent at Medical University Hospital. Burns, decubitus ulcers, and cystic fibrosis were common precipitating factors for acquisition of gentamicin-resistant organisms. Pseudomonas aeruginosa accounted for 76% and Enterobacteriaceae for 24% of isolates. There was high prevalence of cross-resistance to amikacin (61%) and tobramycin (58%). Of the P aeruginosa strains 36% possessed plasmids which were rapidly detected by agarose gel electrophoresis. None of the isolates transferred gentamicin resistance. Representative isolates failed to elaborate aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes or to take up labelled amikacin. Multiple immunotypes of P aeruginosa were identified. These data suggest that a nonplasmid mediated resistance mechanism such as impermeability was responsible for the emergence of gentamicin resistance.
