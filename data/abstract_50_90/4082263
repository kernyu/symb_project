A model of human hookworm infection has been developed which shows that dogs with chronic hookworm infection are considerably resistant to reinfection one month after the termination of the primary infection with anthelmintics. Challenge and control dogs were infected with 1,800 larvae and the infection was followed for six weeks. When compared with control dogs, faecal egg excretion and intestinal adult worm burdens in challenge dogs were reduced by 85% and 77%, respectively. Infection had no significant effect on haemoglobin concentrations, total white cell counts, platelet levels or spontaneous and phytohaemagglutinin-induced lymphocyte transformations in both control and previously infected dogs. Both groups of dogs developed an eosinophilia and lymphocytes responded transiently to stimulation with both larval and adult worm antigens, although there were no significant differences between the two groups of animals. Specific IgM antibodies were transient in both groups of animals following infection. Specific IgG antibodies were present at high levels before infection in challenge dogs when compared with control dogs, and fell transiently after challenge; three weeks after infection, IgG antibodies appeared in the control animals and titres continued to rise during the period of observation. Challenge dogs also developed specific IgA antibodies three weeks after infection, and these remained at high levels, but these antibodies were not detected in control dogs. Thus, dogs infected with this strain of the hookworm, Ancylostoma ceylanicum, which has been shown to infect man, develop functional protective immunity. These findings improve prospects for vaccine development.
