To evaluate the state of ferriprotoporphyrin IX (FP) in malaria pigment, mouse erythrocytes infected with Plasmodium berghei NYU-2 parasites were lysed by hypotonic shock, and hemoglobin and other soluble material were removed by extensive washing. The amount of FP recovered in the insoluble pellet was 2.1 mumol/ml of packed infected erythrocytes, of which approximately 1% was attributable to hemoglobin contamination. This crude preparation then was digested with a nonspecific protease from Streptomyces griseus and extracted with chloroform/methanol. The residue of insoluble dark brown material had the spectral and solubility properties characteristic of the FP of malaria pigment, and various different preparations contained from 82 to 99% of FP by weight. By elemental analysis, highly purified preparations contained no chlorine and had an oxygen content consistent with 1 mol of hydroxyl/mol of FP (oxygen content: calculated, 12.6%; found, 12.5%). In comparison to hematin purchased from Sigma, which had a measured oxygen content of 14.7%, the low oxygen form of hematin purified from malaria pigment was remarkably less soluble in ethanol, 3% sodium bicarbonate, and chloroform.
