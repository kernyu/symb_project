DNA synthesis induced by N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine in mouse embryo and human embryo cells was compared with DNA synthesis induced in these cells by human cytomegalovirus. In virus infected human embryo cells grown in the medium depleted of arginine DNA synthesis showed resistance to hydroxyurea and arabinofuranosylcytosine, similarly as repair synthesis induced by MNNG. DNA synthesis induced by the virus in mouse embryo cells was partially sensitive to both inhibitors.
