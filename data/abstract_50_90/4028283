In the present multicenter, randomized and double-blind study, performed on 127 hospitalized patients, we compared the effects of three antibiotics (cephemic cofosfolactamine, cephalexin and fosfomycin) in the treatment of acute or recurrent systemic infections. Results show that the percentage of recoveries of clinical symptoms and of bacterial eradications were significantly higher, and associated with a lower rate of side effects in the patients treated by cephemic cofosfolactamine than in those treated by cephalexin or fosfomycin.
