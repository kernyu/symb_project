An account is given of the first hundred consecutive proven cases of sulphone resistance in leprosy, detected in Malaysia between 1963 and 1974. Proof of resistance was clinical in eighty patients and was obtained by drug-sensitivity testing in mice in ninety-six patients; 76 cases were proved both clinically and experimentally, and there was no discrepancy between the two methods. Sulphone resistance was confined to patients with lepromatous-type leprosy--i.e., patients with a large bacterial population. Clinical evidence of relapse due to drug resistance appeared 5-24 years after the start of sulphone treatment. Low dosage favoured the appearance of resistance; therefore regular treatment of lepromatous leprosy with dapsone in full dosage is recommended. The attainment of "skin smears negative for leprosy bacilli" is no test of cure of lepromatous leprosy.
