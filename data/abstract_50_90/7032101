In our study we compared five methods of testing the sensitivity of yeasts against 5 Fluorocytosine. We examined these five methods with regard to their ability for the laboratory routine. We found, in accordance with other authors, the microtiter technique to be the most useful one. In the second part of our study we were able to show, that it is possible to induce in yeasts a secondary resistance to 5 FC in vitro.
