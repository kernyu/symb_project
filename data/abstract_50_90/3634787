Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains present an increasing clinical problem. Analysis of 2679 strains submitted to a reference laboratory in the first quarter of 1983 and 3050 strains submitted in summer 1984 showed 479 and 593 multi-resistant strains. The proportion of methicillin-resistant strains classified as epidemic rose from 5.9 to 10.2%. Other methicillin-resistant strains continued to occur but other methicillin-sensitive multi-resistant strains appeared to fall. A strain with defined characters could be recognized in the Thames regions.
