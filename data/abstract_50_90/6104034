Cerebral tuberculomas developed in two adult Asian immigrants during treatment for miliary tuberculosis and tuberculous meningitis. Both were infected by strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis sensitive in vitro to all antituberculous drugs, and no evidence of immunodeficiency was detected. Focal neurological signs appeared and the lesions led to the death of one patient despite maximum treatment. The importance of systemic corticosteroids in controlling the raised intracranial pressure is discussed.
