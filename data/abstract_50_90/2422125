In gonococci, the nonspecific antimicrobial resistance locus penB is known to be closely linked to loci designated nmp that alter the Mr and antigenicity of the outer membrane porin protein I (P.I). We report that after selection for the linked donor penB locus, occasional recombinants expressed P.I with some epitopes from each parent. These hybrid P.I antigens were stable on subculture and were transformed at a locus closely linked to penB. The hybrid P.I antigens were detected with monoclonal antibodies in both coagglutination and Western blot assays. The alterations of P.I antigenicity may have resulted from recombination between structural genes for P.I that are closely linked to penB.
