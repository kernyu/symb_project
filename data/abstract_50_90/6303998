The resistance of spores of Bacillus subtilis NCTC 10073 to glutaraldehyde, sodium hypochlorite and povidone-iodine was compared. Revival of treated spores was examined by use of defined germination media and conditions, protein denaturing agents, ultrasonics and heat. Revival, obtained after treatment with each of the three chemical agents, originated under different sets of conditions and was of two recognizably distinct types. The results, including the evidence of electron microscopy, are discussed in terms of chemical-spore reactivity and the implications on their use and suitability as chemical sterilizers.
