The content of cholesterol (Chl) and phospholipids (Phl) in cell lines L and CHO-K1, sensitive and resistant to the toxic action of ethidium bromide, has been studied. EB-resistant cells were shown to have lower amounts of Chl and Phl, and the ratio Chl/Phl in these cells was decreased too. EB-resistant cells, grown in serum-free medium, have dramatically decreased contents of Chl, while compared with the cells growing with serum. Treatment of EB-resistant cells with methyltestosterone in concentration of 3 X 10(-7) M caused the increase in Chl and Phl contents, thus approximating these indices to those of EB-sensitive ones.
