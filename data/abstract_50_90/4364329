Mutant TH14 of Bacillus megaterium ATCC 19213 is thermosensitive and defective in cell-division septation and spore formation at the restrictive temperature (39 C). As a consequence, the mutant forms multinucleate aseptate filaments and is asporogenic. The mutation does not result in any qualitative compositional changes in extractable membrane proteins. At the restrictive temperature, the mutant membrane has a reduced content of a small molecular weight protein(s). A membrane protein(s) with a molecular weight of nearly 80,000 appears to be partially derepressed in the mutant grown at the restrictive temperature. In addition, numerous unidentified spherical inclusions of fairly uniform size (diameter approximately 100 nm) are present in the cytoplasm at the restrictive temperature. They are especially concentrated at only one pole of each filament. Filamentous growth of the mutant is less sensitive to penicillin than growth in the rod form. Growth in either form is equally sensitive to d-cycloserine at the concentrations used for selection of the mutant. Temperature shift-up experiments suggest that one to two rounds of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) replication occur before the phenotypic expression of the mutation occurs. The septations after these replication events can be either two-division septations or a single-division septation plus a subsequent sporulation septation. This conclusion, coupled with previously reported work, supports the hypothesis that the early stages of sporulation represent a modified cell division.
