Antimicrobial susceptibility to cefamandole versus cephalothin and cefazolin versus cephalothin was compared by the broth microdilution method against 3,000 and 5,895 clinical bacterial isolates, respectively. Cefamandole and, to a lesser degree, cefazolin showed greater activity than cephalothin against Enterobacteriaceae, but the three drugs were comparable against gram-positive cocci.
