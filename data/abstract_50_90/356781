The blood culture results of patients of S. M. Nuova Hospital of Florence (Italy) have been examined in a period of nine years (1967-1976). We can attest from this results that in the last years of this period we have had an increase of the number of Enterobacteriaceae from blood culture. In the meanwhile we have had a decrease of positive results that is not due to an increase of the number of blood culture; in fact it has been doubled, but this decrease is mostly due to a larger number of examinated patients that to an increase of blood culture for each patient. Introduction in the routine of a diphasic culture system (Castaneda) commercially available has allowed contaminants' decrease. Antibiotic resistance of most important bacteria isolated in the last three years (1974-1976) were carry out.
