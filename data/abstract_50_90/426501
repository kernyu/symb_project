During an 8-month period, 858 gram-negative aerobic rods resistant to carbenicillin (minimum inhibitory concentration, >/=128 mug/ml) were isolated. Susceptibility testing of 233 of these suggested that piperacillin might be active against more of these organisms than would carbenicillin or ticarcillin.
