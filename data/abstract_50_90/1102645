Nonspecific enhancers of resistance may include (1) viral interference, (2) interferon, (3) interferon inducers, (4) bacterial interference, (5) bacterial products such as Coley's "toxins," endotoxins, or staphylococcal, BCG, and Corynebacterium parvum vaccines, (6) transfer factor, and (7) well-defined chemicals such as dinitrochlorbenzene, levamisole, and vitamin C. These are discussed only as they have been applied to man to learn whether or not they have enhanced his ability to resist infections and growth of tumors. Preliminary studies suggest that a variety of relatively safe and effective nonspecific enhancers may soon be available for clinical use.
