Colonisation by yeasts and invasive yeast-growth (candidosis, yeast-mycosis) increase whenever a patient's power of resistance is lowered. Early recognition of colonizing yeasts in a patient can be as important for his vital functions, as the therapy of the underlying disease will be. This seems to be quite complicated in many cases and often it is omitted by several reasons. An "easy to handle method" is a "rapid yeast culture". Blood-cultures and serodiagnosis can be added if held necessary. It is more important to find out, if there are few or many yeast-cells in a patient, than to count them. Hidden "yeast-nests" can in short time recruit eliminated yeasts. Too much sugar means too many yeasts as well. Anti-yeast-therapeutics have to be selected and dosed according to their characteristic qualities.
