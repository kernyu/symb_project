As it had been shown in previous trials that very small doses of pyrimethamine and sulfadoxine or dapsone were effective in eliminating Plasmodium falciparum in 2 or 3 days, small-scale field trials were carried out on children to investigate the efficacy of this combination of drugs in suppressing malaria.Doses of pyrimethamine 2 mg with sulfadoxine 40 mg, fortnightly, appeared to be completely successful in suppressing seasonal hyperendemic malaria in a group of 38 Gambian children over a 6-month period. On the other hand, pyrimethamine alone at the recommended dose failed to suppress falciparum malaria in some children of another group. Parasite resistance to the sulfonamide-pyrimethamine combination was not encountered nor was there any suggestion of toxicity. It is concluded that these drugs in combination could have a place in malaria chemoprophylaxis.
