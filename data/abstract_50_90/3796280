The object of the investigation was the evaluation of the susceptibility to antibiotic and chemotherapeutic agents of 240 strains of Salmonella agona isolated from different sources (human, food and environment) obtained from five Brazilian states (Minas Gerais, Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Pernambuco and Rio Grande do Sul). The presence of R factors in 26 representative strains of the sample was also determined.
