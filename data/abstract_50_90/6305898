We studied the effect of ethanol on the electrical and ion transport properties of dog tracheal epithelium using Ussing's short-circuit technique. There was a significant reduction of short-circuit current and electrical potential difference and a tendency of electrical resistance to increase in response to increasing concentrations of ethanol in the bathing solutions. Threshold changes in the electrical properties were noted at an ethanol concentration of 3.3 microliter/ml (260 mg/100 ml). Ethanol did not produce these changes in electrical properties when Cl- and Na+ were substituted in the bathing media with either choline or SO2-(4). In five paired tissue preparations, ethanol (13.3 microliters/ml) significantly reduced the net flux of Cl- toward the lumen from 2.68 +/- 0.62 to 1.00 +/- 0.69 (SE) mu eq X cm-2 X h-1, due primarily to a reduced unidirectional flux of Cl- from submucosa to lumen. These observations demonstrate that ethanol has an effect on the ion transport and electrical properties of dog tracheal epithelium at concentrations that may be of clinical relevance.
