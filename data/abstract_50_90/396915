Strains of Salmonella typhi isolated in Singapore were susceptible to chloramphenicol (except from two imported cases) and most of them also generally susceptible to ampicillin and septrin. Drug-resistant strains of Salmonella typhimurium appeared in 1971 and caused out-breaks among young children. However, decreasing drug-resistance of S. typhimurium was recorded in recent years following a drop in the number of cases. Other Salmonella serovers were found relatively susceptible to the antibiotics tested.
