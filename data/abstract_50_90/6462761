Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of amphotericin B, 5-fluorocytosine, miconazole, tioconazole, econazole and ketoconazole were determined for 310 Aspergillus strains belonging to four different species isolated from clinical specimens. Econazole exhibited the best in vitro activity with MIC less than or equal to 3.12 micrograms/ml for 96% of strains and less than or equal to 1.56 micrograms/ml for 68%. For amphotericin B, 69% of strains were less than or equal to 1.56 micrograms/ml and, for 5-fluorocytosine, 50% were less than or equal to 25 micrograms/ml. Miconazole and ticonazole exhibited comparable in vitro activities with MIC less than or equal to 6.25 micrograms/ml for 66% and 58% of strains respectively. Ketoconazole was the less active agent in vitro, with MIC less than or equal to 6.25 micrograms/ml for only 27% of strains. Moreover, this study demonstrated significant differences in susceptibility from species to species. A. fumigatus was susceptible to amphotericin B (75%) and 47% of strains were susceptible to 5-fluorocytosine. A. niger showed high susceptibility to amphotericin B (82%) and 5-fluorocytosine (82%). A. flavus exhibited the highest resistance to 5-fluorocytosine (14%), the highest susceptibility to ketoconazole (72%), and average susceptibility to amphotericin B (41%). A. nidulans was rarely susceptible to amphotericin B (21%) or 5-fluorocytosine (29%) and 46% of strains were susceptible to miconazole and ketoconazole. These results provide useful guidelines for the choice of antifungal agents in the difficult treatment of aspergillosis.
