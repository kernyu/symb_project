Escherichia coli mutants have been isolated that are permissive for the infection by T4 phage with deletion in the cistron for the phage lysozyme, the e gene. Some, but not all, of these mutants are simultaneously permissive for the infection by T4 phage defective in the t gene, the product of which has also been implicated in the release of progeny phages. Most of these mutants shared the following properties: temperature sensitivity in growth and cell division, increased sensitivity towards a number of unrelated antibiotics and colicins, and increased sensitivity towards anionic detergents (sodium dodecyl sulfate and sodium deoxycholate). The possible biochemical basis for these phenotypes is discussed.
