Colwell, Rita R. (Georgetown University, Washington, D.C.), and Richard Y. Morita. Reisolation and emendation of description of Vibrio marinus (Russell) Ford. J. Bacteriol. 88:831-837. 1964.-Sixteen fresh isolates from the marine environment were subjected to taxonomic analysis. From the taxonomic data, both quantitative and qualitative, these strains appear to form a species-group closely related to the Vibrio marinus isolated by Russell from the gulf of Naples in 1891. The V. marinus species description is extended. As a peculiarly marine species, the organisms are distinguished by features of inorganic salt requirement and psychrophilism, as well as by an ability to form acid from glucose anaerobically and a marked curvature of the cells.
