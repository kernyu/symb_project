The prevalence of resistance to six commonly-used antimicrobial agents in faecal coliforms from children in Khartoum, Sudan was studied. A relatively high prevalence of resistance was found, ranging from 96% of children with isolates resistant to ampicillin to 70% of children with isolates resistant to chloramphenicol. Seventy-seven percent of children had isolates with high-level resistance to trimethoprim (MIC greater than 1000 micrograms/ml). Twenty-nine different resistance patterns were found. Thirty-nine percent of the children had isolates resistant to all six antibiotics studied, and 80% of children had isolates resistant to at least four. Transfer of resistance to each of the antimicrobials, in varying combinations, was demonstrated, but did not occur for all resistance patterns. Plasmid analysis showed plasmids ranging from 160 MDa to 2.8 MDa and isolates contained from one to five plasmids of different sizes. There were no consistent relationships between resistance pattern and plasmid profile, but multiple resistance transfer was mediated commonly by plasmids with a molecular weight of 62 MDa. The high prevalence of potentially transferable antibiotic resistance in gut commensals of children in the Sudan may be of importance in the management of enteric and other infections requiring antimicrobial treatment.
