The in vitro activity of five quinolone compounds, amoxicillin, and clindamycin against 118 strains of anaerobic bacteria isolated at community hospitals was determined by an agar dilution method. Nalidixic acid and cinoxacin had poor activity, and norfloxacin and enoxacin showed relatively poor activity. Ciprofloxacin was active against Bacteroides fragilis, Fusobacterium species, Clostridium perfringens, and gram-positive cocci. At peak levels achievable in the feces, norfloxacin and enoxacin had moderate activity.
