The beneficial effects of gamma-globulin, which were used for agammaglobulinemia and severe infectious disease as an adjuvant or combination therapy in conjunction with antibiotics, are well known. In this study, a new intravenous human gamma-globulin (SM-4300) was administered to 5 patients with bacterial infection and 2 patients with viral infection. In 4 out of 7 patients (57.1%), several symptoms such as high fever, general fatigue and pain were improved clinically. Furthermore, there were no side effects due to SM-4300 either in clinical findings or in laboratory examinations.
