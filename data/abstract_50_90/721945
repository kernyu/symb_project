A total of 64 isolates of Klebsiella ozaenae were recovered from 36 patients during a 40-month period. Over 7,500 isolates of K. pneumoniae were isolated during the same time period. Before this decade, K. ozaenae was considered to be only a colonizer of the nasopharynx or a putative cause of ozena (atrophic rhinitis). K. ozaenae was recovered most frequently from sputum in mixed culture but was associated with infection in 12 patients (2 with bacteremia, 3 with urinary tract infection, 1 with soft tissue infection, and 6 with mucopurulent nasal discharge). The spectrum of disease caused by this organism is more extensive than has been appreciated previously.
