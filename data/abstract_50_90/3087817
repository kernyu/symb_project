A series of plasmid-based promoter-probe vectors has been constructed which are particularly useful for the analysis of divergent control regions. Each vector contains a pair of divergently oriented indicator genes whose expression can be monitored over a wide range by simple assay methods. These genes are separated by different polylinkers. Specifically, the beta-galactosidase gene (lacZ) was employed in combination with either the galactokinase gene (galK) or the alkaline phosphatase gene (phoA). In all cases translational stop codons are present in all three reading frames upstream from the initiation codon. The vectors permit direct detection of promoters--independent of insert orientation--on indicator plates after transformation. Using this vector system, we further characterized the divergent tet control regions of transposon Tn10 and plasmid pBR322.
