Several commercial systems are available to distinguish between Staphylococcus aureus and the coagulase-negative species of the Micrococcaceae family. Four latex agglutination systems (Accu-Staph, SeroSTAT, Staphaurex, and Staphylatex) and two hemagglutination systems (Hemastaph and Staphyloslide) were compared for their performance in the rapid identification of 232 isolates of staphylococci, including 114 of methicillin-resistant S. aureus. Accu-Staph, Staphaurex, and Staphyloslide correctly identified 100% of the methicillin-resistant S. aureus isolates; Hemastaph and Staphylatex, 99.1%; and SeroSTAT, 94.7%. Most reactions were easy to interpret, although 15% of the SeroSTAT reactions were weak. Autoagglutination occurred only with isolates of coagulase-negative staphylococci. False-positive reactions were rare and occurred only with systems which did not detect autoagglutination. Five of these six systems appear to be adequate for the rapid identification of S. aureus, including methicillin-resistant isolates.
