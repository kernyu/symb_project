The wide host-range antibiotic resistance plasmid RP1 was transferred from Pseudomonas aeruginosa via Escherichia coli into Pseudomonas glycinea. The plasmid was then acquired by Pseudomonas phaseolicla both in vitro and in planta in Phaseolus limensis leaves and pods. This was the first step in the design of a model system to determine the possible epidemiological significance of antibiotic resistance plasmids in the control of plant disease.
