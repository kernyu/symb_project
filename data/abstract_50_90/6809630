By subcutaneous treatment with an aqueous solution of 6-O-stearoyl-N-acetylmuramyl-L-alanyl-D-isoglutamine [6-O-CH3-(CH2)16-CO-MurNAc-L-Ala-D-isoGln] [referred to here as L18-MDP(Ala)], an augmentation of the resistance of mice to Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Staphylococcus aureus, and Candida albicans infections was observed, but not to infections with Klebsiella pneumoniae and Listeria monocytogenes. Against E. coli infections, L18-MDP(Ala) was highly protective, irrespective of the administration route. Bacteremia occurring at an early phase of such infections was almost completely prevented by subcutaneous treatment 1 day before infection. Single or multiple doses were also effective against C. albicans infection. The phagocytosis of E. coli by mouse peritoneal polymorphonuclear cells was enhanced by treatment with the adjuvant, and the phagocytosis of K. pneumoniae was also enhanced, but only when the mice were treated either with rabbit normal serum or with a specific immune serum. The growth of the fungus in the kidneys was significantly inhibited, and growth was eliminated from the kidneys by treatment with the adjuvant once a day for 4 consecutive days, starting 1 day before infection. However, no growth suppression of L. monocytogenes in the livers or spleens of infected mice was observed when they were treated with a single dose of the adjuvant. This difference may be ascribed to the differences in the effector mechanisms of defense and to the different degree of augmentation of each defense mechanism by L18-MDP(Ala).
