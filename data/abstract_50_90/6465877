A total of 8579 Salmonella strains received during 1973-1982 were tested for their antibiogram patterns against nine routinely used antibiotics including gentamicin. Of these, 380 strains (4.4%) showed resistance to gentamicin at levels of 10 micrograms/ml and above. A high degree of resistance to gentamicin was recorded in 1979 (18.7%) and 1980 (9.4%). M.I.C. levels of strains received during 1982 were determined and it was found that some strains had levels as high as 160 micrograms/ml. The comparative results of gentamicin resistance from 1973 to 1982 are presented and the public health significance of the alarming increase in two years (1979-1980) is discussed.
