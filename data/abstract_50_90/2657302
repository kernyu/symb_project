Thirty-one dapsone resistant lepromatous leprosy patients receiving clofazimine based therapy were serologically monitored throughout their 5-year period of treatment. Sequentially collected sera were used to examine 4 Mycobacterium leprae antigens to evaluate their usefulness in ELISA's for monitoring the progress of their therapy. The ELISA results were compared with decline in bacterial load over the treatment period and with duration of treatment. In addition the ELISA's were compared with each other. The ELISA's based on the measurement of IgM antibodies to the two neoglycoproteins (NDO and NTO) representing the phenolic glycolipid antigen of M. leprae were found to be the most effective with regard to monitoring treatment. A whole M. leprae based ELISA was less efficient in monitoring treatment because it failed to measure antibodies in 5 out of 31 patients. The ELISA-inhibition test based on the detection of antibodies to a species-specific epitope on the 36 K antigen of M. leprae was less suitable because of persistent reactivity during therapy.
