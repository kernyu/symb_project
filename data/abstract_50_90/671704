Rifampin was added to existing antibiotic regimens in two patients with Staphylococcus epidermidis infections; one patient had prosthetic valve endocarditis and the other had an infection of a CSF shunt. The addition of rifampin increased serum or CSF bactericidal titers 16-fold or greater and was correlated with a favorable clinical response. The results of tests for tube-dilution antibiotic susceptibility showed rifampin to be the most active of all antibiotics tested against the patients' organisms. The combinations of gentamicin sulfate, nafcillin sodium, or vancomycin hydrochloride with rifampin prevented the emergence of rifampin resistance in vitro and promoted enhanced killing when compared with either antibiotic alone.
