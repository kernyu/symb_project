Selected cephalosporins, including cefamandole, cephaloridine, cephaloglycin, and cefoxitin, were examined for their ability to inhibit the enzymatic activity of and act as substrates for beta-lactamases produced by Enterobacter cloacae and Staphylococcus aureus. Enzyme inhibition was determined by Michaelis-Menten kinetic measurements and by a spot plate assay using a chromogenic substrate (Glaxo compound 87/312). These two methods provide comparable estimates of kinetic parameters. Inhibition of beta-lactamase, as measured by these two methods, was generally found to correlate with resistance to hydrolysis and is proposed as a preliminary method of assessing susceptibility of cephalosporins to beta-lactamase hydrolysis. Four 7-alphaOCH(3), 7-alphaH cephalosporin analogue pairs were also examined. The presence of the 7-alphaOCH(3) substituent invariably resulted in reduced susceptibility to enzymatic hydrolysis, regardless of the other C7 substituent. The 7-alphaOCH(3) compounds were also better inhibitors than were their 7-alphaH analogues, with the exception that 7-alphaOCH(3) compounds having C7 adipic acid substituents were less inhibitory to the S. aureus enzyme than were the corresponding 7-alphaH analogues. Response of these two enzymes to 7-alphaOCH(3) and 7-alphaH cephalosporins suggests that beta-lactamase hydrolysis of these compounds involves attack at the alpha side of the betalactam ring.
