The authors have carried out the laboratory and clinical studies of SM-4300 and obtained the following results. Serum level of IgG before and after administration of SM-4300 was observed in a case with agammaglobulinemia. The serum level reached the peak at 30 minutes after administration of SM-4300 and the half-life was about 25 days. SM-4300 enhanced the opsonic activity of human neutrophils to Pseudomonas aeruginosa in vitro. In substitution therapy against agammaglobulinemia, the clinical effect of SM-4300 was observed. Four patients with severe infections were treated with SM-4300 and antibiotics and evaluated. Clinical effects of SM-4300 in combination therapy with antibiotics were excellent in 2 cases, good in 1 case and poor in 1 case. The subjective and objective clinical side effects and abnormal laboratory findings were not noted.
