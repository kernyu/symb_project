Transduction with phage derived from a 2-year-old lysate of lambda cam105 (lambda::Tn9) gave rise to chloramphenicol-resistant (Cm(r)) transductants harboring a plasmid (plambdaCM1) formed from lambda cam105 by a Tn9-mediated adjacent deletion to position 36.07 kilobases in the N cistron of lambda. The plambdaCM element can replicate as a plasmid, insert into the bacterial genome, or reproduce lytically as a phage on cells that provide N function. The feasibility of obtaining high titers in encapsidated form and the ease of synchronous introduction into and recovery from bacterial populations make plambdaCM very suitable for quantitative studies of recombination involving transposable elements. Replicon fusions between plambdaCM1 and RSF1596 (pMB8::Tn3Delta596) occur by duplication of either IS1 (at low rate in the absence of TnpA activity) or Tn3Delta596 (in the presence of TnpA activity). At 24 or 32 degrees C, the rate of increase of TnpA-mediated fusions per plambdaCM is about 2% per cell doubling. RSF103 contains the deleted Tn1DeltaAp (which lacks intact beta-lactamase and TnpR resolvase coding sequences) adjacent to a streptomycin resistance (Sm(r)) determinant. We observed that Tn1DeltaAp mediates insertions of external RSF103 sequences into the R388 plasmid. R388::Tn1DeltaAp plasmids show transposition immunity in cells lacking TnpR activity. Using the plambdaCM system, we isolated adjacent transpositions of the RSF103 Sm(r) determinant. The resulting plambdaCM-Sm cosmids contain Sm(r) genetic material flanked by direct repeats of Tn1DeltaAp, and all are deleted for some RSF103 or plambdaCM sequences. The plambdaCM-Sm constructs will fuse into R388 by duplication of a single Tn1DeltaAp element. In the presence of tnpR(+) (but not tnpR) Tn1 or Tn3 elements, all Tn1DeltaAp-mediated complex replicons break down completely and rapidly to simple Tn1DeltaAp inserts. The equilibrium for resolution is at least 10(5):1, and resolution is more than 90% complete after 40 min of exposure to a tnpR(+) cytoplasm. In the absence of TnpR, Rec, and Red activities, Tn1DeltaAp-mediated complex replicons yield simple Tn1DeltaAp inserts at a lower rate. The presence of intact RSF103 replication determinants between direct Tn1DeltaAp repeats appears to accelerate this precise TnpR- and Rec-independent breakdown.
