Four hundred and forty clinical isolates were tested on Baird-Parker and Vogel-Johnson agars with 6 micrograms/ml of oxacillin, to determine their growth characteristics on these potential screening media for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). While both media performed well individually, a combination biplate with each medium may be the most useful in screening patients for MRSA from normally non-sterile sites.
