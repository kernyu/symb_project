Routine typing was performed on a total of 7089 Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains isolated in 16 Belgian hospitals in the period from 1977 to 1986. The annual number of strains received ranged from 318 to 1346. The incidence of serotype O:12 was less than 2% until 1981 when it rose to 4%, steadily increasing to become the predominant serotype in 1984 (22%), 1985 (18%) and 1986 (22%). Since 1980 the O:12 isolates have exhibited characteristic patterns on pyocin and phage typing, 89% of O:12 isolates belonging to pyocin types 1, 39, 43, 45 or 105, whereas only 51% of isolates of other serotypes belonged to those pyocin types. Ninety-three per cent of serotype O:12 isolates belonged to phage types 68/119x, 68 or 119x, or were non-typable, whereas only 24.37% of other serotypes isolates exhibited these phage patterns. These distinctive patterns of pyocin and phage types suggest a high degree of homogeneity within the O:12 strains isolated in recent years in Belgium. Multi-centre or country-wide survey of Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains isolated in hospitals using epidemiological markers may be of value in identifying a sudden increase in epidemic strains.
