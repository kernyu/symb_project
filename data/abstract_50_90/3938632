Three broad host-range MLS plasmids, pAM beta 1 (Em), pIP501 (Em, Cm) and pJH4 (Em, Sm, Km), were transferred by a conjugation-like process from Streptococcus faecalis to Clostridium acetobutylicum. The plasmids were stably maintained and antibiotic resistances were fully expressed in C. acetobutylicum, except for chloramphenicol resistance, which was poorly expressed, if at all. The C. acetobutylicum strains harbouring every plasmid could be used as donors in intraspecific matings with frequencies of approximately 1 X 10(-5) to 1 X 10(-6).
