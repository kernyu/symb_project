Clinical trials were carried out with sulbactam/cefoperazone (SBT/CPZ) (combination ratio of 1:1) in pediatric infections. Results were as follows. The mean half-lives of SBT and CPZ in the serum following intravenous injection of SBT/CPZ were about 0.7 and 1.2 hours, respectively. Urinary excretions of SBT and CPZ within 6 hours after intravenous injection of SBT/CPZ were 81.9% and 28.1%, respectively. SBT/CPZ was administered to 33 pediatric patients with various infection; 18 respiratory tract infections, 12 urinary tract infections and 3 Salmonella enterocolitis. The overall efficacy rate was 87.9%. In particular, 7 of 8 urinary tract infections caused by beta-lactamase producing organisms were improved after administration of SBT/CPZ. Diarrhea in 8 and soft stool in 3 of 33 patients occurred, and slight elevation of GOT/GPT was observed in 2 patients.
