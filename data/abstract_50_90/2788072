Twelve strains of Staphylococcus aureus were studied. All the strains were tested for penicillinase production by the iodometric and starch-paper methods. Ten out of 12 strains produced penicillinase. A strain which was gentamicin resistant and penicillinase producer was tested for synergism using the killing growth method. Synergism was observed between cloxacillin and gentamicin. These two antibiotics can now be used to treat infection by Staphylococcus aureus especially those that produce penicillinase and gentamicin resistant.
