The protective efficacy of immunization against Bacteroides gingivalis infection was examined in hamsters. Whole cells or extracted hemagglutinin of B. gingivalis 381 was injected with incomplete Freund adjuvant into the inguinal regions of hamsters. Two weeks after the rats received a booster injection, cotton threads were tied coronally to the gingival margins of the mandibular first molars, and then a streptomycin-resistant B. gingivalis 381R' strain was inoculated into the rats' oral cavities. The subcutaneous immunizations resulted in slight reductions in the numbers of B. gingivalis on the ligature threads compared with the sham-immunized group. Peroral administration of whole cells of B. gingivalis to hamsters elicited salivary immunoglobulin responses, but no reduction of B. gingivalis 381R' colonization was found in this group. Repeated passive immunizations with rabbit antiserum to B. gingivalis into the oral cavities of the hamsters resulted in a reduction in the number of organisms in the periodontal region.
