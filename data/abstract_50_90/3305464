Ceftazidime and cefazolin/tobramycin were compared in the treatment of hospitalized patients with pneumonia. Iv doses 8-hourly were: ceftazidime--2 g, cefazolin--1.5 g, tobramycin--1.7 mg/kg. For patients with pseudomonas infection randomized to cefazolin/tobramycin, ticarcillin (3 g iv 4-hourly) was used instead of cefazolin. One hundred and ten of 129 patients were evaluable (ceftazidime = 52, cefazolin/tobramycin = 58). Seventy five cases (68%) had documented pathogens of which 81% were aerobic Gram-negative bacilli. Analysis of clinical response showed no difference in overall results (P = 0.77), or separate outcomes: cured (P = 0.85), improved (P = 0.62), failed (P = 0.53), or relapsed (P = 0.50). No differences in bacteriological response were noted either: eradication (P greater than 0.10), elimination with recurrence (P greater than 0.10), persistence (P greater than 0.10). The incidence of enterococcal and fungal colonization and superinfection was the same for both regimens. There was a greater incidence of Coombs' test positivity with ceftazidime (P less than 0.01) but greater nephrotoxicity with cefazolin/tobramycin (P less than 0.02). Ceftazidime appears to be as efficacious as cefazolin/tobramycin in the treatment of hospitalized patients with pneumonia, and is less nephrotoxic.
