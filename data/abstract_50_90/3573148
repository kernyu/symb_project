Results of in vivo studies showed that the transcription of the Xp10 genome in Xp10-infected cells shifted from rifampin sensitivity to rifampin resistance. Results of in vitro studies showed that a rapid reduction of rifampin-sensitive RNA polymerase activity coincided with a rapid increase of rifampin-resistant RNA polymerase activity in cell extracts with time after infection. Host and Xp10-encoded RNA polymerases were purified, and the transcripts from these two enzymes were hybridized to the restriction fragments of Xp10 DNA. The RNA probe generated by host RNA polymerase hybridized strongly to the leftmost 25% of Xp10 DNA and weakly to the rightmost 75% of Xp10 DNA. The RNA probe generated by Xp10 RNA polymerase hybridized strongly to the rightmost 75% of Xp10 DNA and weakly to the leftmost 25% of Xp10 DNA. Studies with 32P-labeled RNA isolated at various intervals after infection did not reveal any evidence for early versus late differences in transcription.
