The wild type strain of Streptomyces glaucescens produces hydroxystreptomycin and has a natural resistance towards the streptomycin group aminoglycoside antibiotics. The inherent resistance is a genetically unstable character and mutant strains sensitive to streptomycins arise spontaneously at unusually high frequencies. The gene conferring streptomycin resistance was cloned and characterised as a streptomycin specific phosphotransferase. Hybridisation experiments show that the mutational event leading to sensitivity is due to large deletions, most likely on the chromosome, comprehending the structural gene coding for a streptomycin phosphotransferase and its flanking regions. Interspecific expression of the S. glaucescens phosphotransferase was found in Streptomyces lividans as well as in Escherichia coli.
