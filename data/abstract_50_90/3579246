Strains of Acinetobacter were shown to be widely distributed in the environment of traumatological and orthopedic hospitals and in clinical pathological materials. This permitted to consider Acinetobacter as an agent causing hospital infections. It was shown that Acinetobacter strains were resistant to the majority of antibacterial drugs. The potential ability of Acinetobacter to transfer resistance plasmids to other strains is of particular danger for distribution of resistant microorganisms in hospitals.
