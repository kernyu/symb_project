Staphylococcus aureus, phage type 29/52/80, caused an outbreak of infections in Michigan over a period of two years and continues to be the most prevalent type seen. Of 3,752 isolates typed in 1980-81, 25 per cent were this phage type, which was strongly associated with methicillin resistance. Using this phage type as an indicator, we could demonstrate the spread of methicillin resistant staphylococci from Detroit metropolitan hospitals to suburban and, to a lesser extent, to hospitals outside the Detroit area.
