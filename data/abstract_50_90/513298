Having resistance to beta-lactamase-producing strains and showing resistance to not only cephalosporin resistant strains of E. coli and Klebsiella but also to Citrobacter, Proteus and Enterobacter, Cefuroxime (CXM) was used in pediatric field for both fundamental and clinical studies. CXM was found to be a useful antibiotic in views of high clinical efficacy rate obtained and no side effect noted. As for the dose, the single dose of 25 mg/kg achieved sufficient blood levels. Also in view of good clinical effect, the dose of 25 mg/kg three or four times daily seems appropriate for treatment of children.
