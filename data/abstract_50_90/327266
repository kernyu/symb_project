The transfer defect of some ColE1 mutants is complemented by ColE1 or ColK, but not by ColE2. This implies that at least one ColE1-specified protein or RNA is normally needed for ColE1 conjugal transfer. The gene(s) postulated for this function lies within a region whose length is at most 50% of the genome.
