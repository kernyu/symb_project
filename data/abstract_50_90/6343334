Trimethoprim (Tp) resistant Gram negative bacteria were isolated from humans and pigs. The bacterial hosts were characterized by their resistance pattern and biotype. The presence of transferable Tp plasmids was demonstrated in 86% of 59 porcine isolates and 37% of 49 human isolates. The Tp R-plasmids carried a diversity of resistance determinants such as Tc, Cm, Sp, Sm and Su. Incompatibility tests distinguished two major groups, Inc FIV and Inc N. Thirty of 99 Tp R-plasmids isolated from humans were grouped as Inc FIV and eight as Inc N. The results of molecular weight determination of Tp R-plasmids performed by agarose gel electrophoresis were consistent with the existence of two groups--larger R-plasmids (76 to 104 Md) belonging to Inc FIV and lower molecular weight R-plasmids (25 to 35 Md) belonging to Inc N. Results from this study indicate that the Tp R-plasmids isolated in Perth have evolved independently from those described in Europe and the United Kingdom. There is also evidence for their local spread between Escherichia, Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Citrobacter and Acinetobacter from man and animals.
