Insertion of the transposable deoxyribonucleic acid sequence that specifies the TEM beta-lactamase (TnA) occurred in at least 19 sites on the 5.5 x 10(6)-dalton plasmid RSF1010. There was no significant difference in the frequency of transposition or in the distribution of TnA insertion sites for recombinant plasmids isolated from recombination-proficient (rec+) or recombination-deficient (rec-) bacterial host cells. The site and orientation of TnA insertions were determined by both heteroduplex analysis and enzymatic digestion with restriction endonucleases. Insertion in the gene encoding for sulfonamide resistance occurred without circular permutation in one or the other of two distinct orientations. Insertions in orientation P were strongly polar on distal gene expression, whereas insertions in orientation M were mutagenic but not polar. In addition, we have observed that TnA elements from different R plasmids show fine structural heterogeneity, and that TnA insertion at a site adjacent to the origin of replication causes an increase in plasmid copy number.
