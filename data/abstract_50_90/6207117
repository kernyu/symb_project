Cloned interferon-sensitive (745) and interferon-resistant (3Cl-8) Friend erythroleukemia cells (FLC) passaged in vitro, are not very tumorigenic when first injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) into syngeneic DBA/2 mice although they do form solid tumors when injected subcutaneously (s.c.). By serially passaging FLC (either 745 or 3Cl-8 cells) i.p. in DBA/2 mice, we obtained two different FLC lines capable of growing i.p. and inducing tumor ascites. The s.c. injection of DBA/2 mice with these in vivo passaged FLC resulted in tumor metastases in the liver and spleen, whereas metastases were not observed in mice inoculated s.c. with in vitro passaged FLC. The capacity of in vivo passaged FLC to metastasize was acquired after several i.p. passages. This highly malignant behavior was a stable characteristic of these cells. All the clones derived from in vivo passaged FLC and passaged more than 14 times in vitro induced hemorrhagic ascites when injected i.p., and metastasized to the liver and spleen when injected s.c. The phenotype of sensitivity or resistance to the inhibitory effect of alpha/beta mouse interferon on virus replication and cell multiplication was conserved during serial i.p. passages and maintained in the clones derived from in vivo passaged cells. These FLC showed a decreased capacity to differentiate in vitro upon treatment with dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and a reduced production of Friend leukemia virus with respect to the original clones passaged in vitro.
