Sixty patients were treated with ciprofloxacin: 19 received only intravenous ciprofloxacin, 41 received intravenous followed by oral ciprofloxacin. The mean duration of therapy was 28 days in the intravenous only group and 10 days intravenously and 80 days orally in the intravenous/oral group. Ten (17 percent) patients received 200 mg intravenously every 12 hours and 49 (82 percent) 300 mg every 12 hours. The overall clinical response was 85 percent, with a bacteriologic response of 70 percent. The lowest bacteriologic response (38 percent) occurred in the 13 patients treated for Pseudomonas respiratory infection. Clinical response occurred in 24 of 26 patients with soft-tissue infection, and 10 of 13 patients with respiratory infection. Of three patients with endocarditis, therapy failed in two with resistance developing in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. Overall, 19 percent of 26 P. aeruginosa isolates developed resistance to ciprofloxacin. Toxicity was minor, with phlebitis and nausea most commonly reported. Intravenously administered ciprofloxacin or intravenous followed by oral ciprofloxacin is a safe, effective therapy for serious infections due to multiply resistant gram-negative bacteria, including P. aeruginosa and S. aureus.
