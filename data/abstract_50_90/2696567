A 24-year-old Caucasian male, living in the Central African Republic, presented with fever due to Plasmodium falciparum infection, although he steadily took chloroquine and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine chemoprophylaxis. Despite treatment with the same drugs at high doses, the parasitaemia persisted. Clinical and parasitological recovery was obtained by the use of quinine. Chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium falciparum strains have spread in all tropical areas. Multiple drug resistance, already described in Asia, has also begun to appear in Africa.
