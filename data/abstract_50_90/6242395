The effect of glutaraldehyde on pericardial tissue has been studied with special reference to the degree of chemical modification, thermal stability and enhancement of the resistance to proteolytic digestion. The nature of the cross-links depends on time and reagent concentration. At least two populations of lysine and hydroxylysine residues can be distinguished on the basis of their reactivity against the aldehyde. The appearance of these families is not dependent on the structural integrity of the tissue. The time course of the tissue modification is not modified by removing lipids and proteoglycans from the biomaterial. Highest thermal stability is obtained by long-term modification at low reagent concentration.
