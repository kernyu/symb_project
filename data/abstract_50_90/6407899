Following the restriction and ligation of pBD12 plasmid and phi 105 phage DNA and subsequent transformation, the insertion of pBD12 DNA into the phi 105 prophage region of the Bacillus subtilis chromosome was achieved. The plasmid markers were linked with the region of prophage immunity and with the markers of the adjacent region of the B. subtilis chromosome. Their behaviour in transformation of cells and protoplasts of rec+ recipients and recE4 mutants was typical of chromosomal markers. The phenotypic expression (resistance to chloramphenicol and kanamycin) of plasmid genes inserted into the chromosome was preserved; however, the resistance levels were reduced.
