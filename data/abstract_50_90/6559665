Activity of eleven antimicrobial agents against methicillin-, methicillin- and rifampin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus was studied using a microtiter broth dilution technique. Coumermycin was the most active agent. Vancomycin, rifampin, fusidic acid and N-formimidoyl-thienamycin showed excellent activity against methicillin-resistant St. aureus (MRSA). Antimicrobial susceptibility pattern was similar for MRSA and methicillin- and rifampin-resistant St. aureus. 8% of MRSA were resistant to trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole.
