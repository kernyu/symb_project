Statistical studies were performed on bacterial strains isolated from the urine of patients with various urological disease in our Urological Department between January, 1983 and December, 1987. In 1987, sensitivity tests of antibiotics to various pathogens were carried out. From the outpatients, 5,725 bacterial strains were isolated. S. epidermidis was isolated most frequently (23.8%), followed by Enterococcus species (16.5%), E. coli (14.7%), Streptococcus species (12.6%), Proteus species (5.3%), other GNR (4.6%), P, aeruginosa (4.5%), Klebsiella species (4.4%), and others. From the inpatients, 4,747 bacterial strains were isolated. Enterococcus species was isolated most frequently (23.1%), followed by S. epidermidis (18.7%), Fungi (12.9%), P. aeruginosa (8.0%), other GNR (6.8%), Streptococcus species (5.4%), Enterobacter species (4.8%), E. coli (4.1%), S. aureus (4.1%) and others. Annual change of distribution of organisms indicated that S. aureus from outpatients had a tendency to increase and Streptococcus species had a tendency to decrease. Whereas from inpatients, E. coli, other GNR, Pseudomonas species and Enterobacter species had a tendency to increase, and Streptococcus species, P. aeruginosa, Proteus species and Klebsiella species had a tendency to decrease. S. epidermidis showed a high sensitivity to minocycline and cephalothin, and Enterococcus showed a high sensitivity to ampicillin and minocycline, but did not show good sensitivity to cefoperazone and latamoxef. E. coli showed a high sensitivity to all drug we tested. P. aeruginosa showed a high sensitivity to gentamycin and norflaxacin, but did not show good sensitivity to other many drugs we tested.
