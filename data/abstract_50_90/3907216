The stable O-form of Proteus has been found to differ from the initial H-form in the absence of flagellae or in a few weakly developed flagellae, in decreased capacity for agglutination with polyvalent and typing sera and in virulence for laboratory animals. As revealed in this study, the conversion of the H-form of Proteus into the stable O-form leads to the loss of resistance to streptomycin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, monomycin, ampicillin and neomycin.
