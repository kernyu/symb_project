62 Staphylococci strains classified according to their ability to produce coagulase and their hemolytic activity were tested on susceptibility to 21 antibacterial substances. The tests were carried out with the agar diffusion and agar dilution methods (mostly ADATAB-System: Breakpoint-method with prefabricated tablets). The majority of the investigated strains showed sufficient susceptibility towards the tested substances. For treatment of multi-resistant strains narrow-spectrum antibiotics are recommended. The antibacterial activity of the combination metronidazol with mezlocillin or oxacillin was exclusively determined by the penicillins used.
