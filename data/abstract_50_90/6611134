From February 1981 to December 1983, 225 strains were isolated from pediatric patients infected with Haemophilus influenzae. Forty-one strains were found to be resistant to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, and other antibiotics. They were isolated from 20 patients with invasive diseases (meningitis, 16; bacteremia, 4) and 21 with noninvasive diseases (otitis media, 19; conjunctivitis, 2). During this period, 44 patients with invasive diseases were seen (meningitis, 28; bacteremia, 16). Strains resistant to both ampicillin and chloramphenicol occurred in 45.4% of cerebrospinal fluid and blood isolates and in 51% of cerebrospinal fluid isolates only. In this group, individual resistance to ampicillin was 50%; chloramphenicol, 52.2%; tetracycline, 54.5%; and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, 63.6%. No epidemiological relationship could be found among the patients. The presence of asymptomatic carriers was investigated in two nurseries and in eight family groups. From a total of 125 individuals studied, 80 were found to be colonized by H. influenzae, and 36 carried multiply resistant strains. From patients and carriers, 77 strains were found to be resistant to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, and other drugs; 39 belonged to type b (cerebrospinal fluid, 16; blood, 4; ear, 7; and nasopharynx, 12), and 38 were non-type b. The most frequent pattern of resistance was ampicillin-chloramphenicol-tetracycline-sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (94.8%), followed by ampicillin-chloramphenicol-tetracycline (3.9%). The disk diffusion method correctly predicted multiple resistance. The mean inhibition zone diameters were: ampicillin, 12.8 mm; chloramphenicol, 15.2 mm; tetracycline, 9.9 mm; and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, 10.8 mm. These resistant strains were susceptible to cefotaxime, moxalactam, cefoperazone, cefuroxime, rifampin, and gentamicin. Our data suggest that in Spain the resistance of H. influenzae to ampicillin and chloramphenicol is endemic and that other effective therapeutic modalities are needed.
