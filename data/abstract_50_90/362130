Growth of wildtype Escherichia coli was inhibited by azaserine. There was an inverse relationship between the initial rate of uptake of phenylalanine and the azaserine concentration. Moderately azaserine-resistant mutants exhibited an initial rate that was similar to that of an aroP mutant, but highly azaserine-resistant mutants exhibited little, if any, uptake of phenylalanine. All of the azaserine-resistant organisms tested harboured a mutation in the aroP+ gene. However, resistance to the antibiotic was not due solely to this lesion.
