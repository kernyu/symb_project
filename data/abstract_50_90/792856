Procedures are described for determining the effects of low level antibiotic feed additives in broiler chick rations when chicks are artificially infected with Salmonella typhimurium var. copenhagen and the effectiveness of the same antibiotics used therapeutically for salmonellosis. These procedures also permit study of development of antibiotic resistant enteric flora related to antibiotic feeding and the transferability of the resistance. Measures should be taken to monitor and assure minimal extraneous bacterial contamination of eggs, chicks, feed and facilities and minimize baseline antibiotics resistance. Facilities and equipment should be fumigated extensively, chicks should be from primary breeder flocks off antibiotics for two generations, handled minimally, and fed all-vegetable protein rations. Optimum procedures for oral induction of salmonellosis with a chick-virulent strain of Salmonella typhimurium var. copenhagen are reported. Effects of low level antibiotic feeding and subsequent therapeutic level feeding of infected and control birds are measured by mortality, feed efficiency and weight gain, and microbiological analyses of fecal samples, intestinal samples and necropsied dead chicks. Gathering all data possible from all facets of the trials is imperative for ascertaining antibiotic effects.
