By gradual (during several months) increase of the concentrations of cycloheximide (C) and chloramphenicol (Ch) in cultural medium there were obtained strains of C. oncopelti resistant to the effect of 20, 50, 100 mkg/ml and 2.5 mg/ml Ch. During 38, 28, 19 and 12 subculturings (that corresponds to 160, 120, 80 and 50 cell generations, respectively) on media without inhibitors parasites preserve their resistance to corresponding concentrations of C and Ch without essential changes. Cross resistance between obtained strains of Crithidia was missing. Therefore, the characters of resistance to C and Ch are rather specific, genetically specified and can be used as genetical markers.
