The clinical effectiveness of Cefmetazole, a new cephamycin antibiotic, was studied in 13 cases of complicated urinary tract infection and in 3 cases of acute simple pyelonephritis. The drug was administrated, in 2 or 4 g doses twice a day, by intravenous drip infusion, for 5 to 10 days. The overall clinical effectiveness rate, based on the UTI efficacy evaluation, was 92% for complicated urinary tract infection and 100% for acute simple pyelonephritis. Among 18 strains isolated, 14 strains were eradicated and 4 strains were replaced. The bacteriological efficacy was 100%. No adverse reaction was noted. Cefmetazole was suggested to be a useful antibiotic for the treatment of urinary tract infections.
