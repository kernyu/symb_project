MDL 19,592, a semisynthetic oral cephalosporin, has an antimicrobial spectrum principally directed against Gram-positive cocci (MIC50, 0.25-4 micrograms/ml), Branhamella catarrhalis (MIC50, 1-2 micrograms/ml), and pathogenic Neisseria spp. such as meningococci (MIC50, 4 micrograms/ml). Enterobacteriaceae, enterococci, Pseudomonas spp., Corynebacterium jeikeium, and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus strains had MDL 19,592 MIC50 of greater than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml. Although MDL 19,592 generally had a spectrum most similar to cefadroxil, it could not be represented by the cephalothin susceptibility test because of low predictive values and MIC correlations.
