Mycobacterium fortuitum has been isolated from skin and soft tissue lesions with increasing frequency. Rarely, however, has it been a documented cause of peritonitis in patients receiving continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis. We report here the second such case and discuss both the possibility of M. fortuitum or similar organisms as one cause of "sterile" peritonitis in this patient population and the in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility testing of such isolates.
