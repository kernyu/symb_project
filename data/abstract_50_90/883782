Sensitivity of Citrobacter isolated from the patients with acute gastro-intestinal infections of unknown etiology in Volgograd was studied. The antibiotic sensitivity to antibiotics was determined by the method of dilution in nutrient agar. Most of the isolates were sensitive to kanamycin, tetracycline and polymyxin. All strains were resistant to ristomycin. The sensitivity of the local strains differed from that described in the literature. Among sero groups 05, 08 and 023 all strains were resistant to oleandomycin, lincomycin and ristomycin. Polyresistant strains of Citrobacter were registered in Volgograd. The greater part (79 per cent) of the strains were simultaneously resistant to 4-6 antibiotics.
