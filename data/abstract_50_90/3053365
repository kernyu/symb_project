Plasmid pIM138 which had been characterized by the higher resistance of its DNA replication to the action of clorobiocin in comparison with the progenitor plasmid, was tested for its stability in host cells in the absence of the antibiotic. Growing without selective pressure, pIM138 was better maintained in cells than pBR322. The stability in the presence and in the absence of clorobiocin can be unanimously assigned to the plasmid itself, but some influence of host cells cannot be excluded.
