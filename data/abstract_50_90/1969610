We report the cloning and functional analysis of a complete clone for the third member of the mouse mdr gene family, mdr3. Nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequence analyses showed that the three mouse mdr genes encode highly homologous membrane glycoproteins, which share the same length (1,276 residues), the same predicted functional domains, and overall structural arrangement. Regions of divergence among the three proteins are concentrated in discrete segments of the predicted polypeptides. Sequence comparison indicated that the three mouse mdr genes were created from a common ancestor by two independent gene duplication events, the most recent one producing mdr1 and mdr3. When transfected and overexpressed in otherwise drug-sensitive cells, the mdr3 gene, like mdr1 and unlike mdr2, conferred multidrug resistance to these cells. In independently derived transfected cell clones expressing similar amounts of either MDR1 or MDR3 protein, the drug resistance profile conferred by mdr3 was distinct from that conferred by mdr1. Cells transfected with and expressing MDR1 showed a marked 7- to 10-fold preferential resistance to colchicine and Adriamycin compared with cells expressing equivalent amounts of MDR3. Conversely, cells transfected with and expressing MDR3 showed a two- to threefold preferential resistance to actinomycin D over their cellular counterpart expressing MDR1. These results suggest that MDR1 and MDR3 are membrane-associated efflux pumps which, in multidrug-resistant cells and perhaps normal tissues, have overlapping but distinct substrate specificities.
