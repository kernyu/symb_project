Sensitivity of herpes simplex virus (HSV) isolates, from patients with recurrent infections, to human fibroblast beta interferon (IFN), was tested in vitro. Among 25 HSV strains, 12 were HSV-1, isolated from facial and labial lesions, and 13 were HSV-2 isolated from genital lesions. Viral sensitivity to IFN was examined on epithelial MB cell line by yield reduction and plaque reduction and close correspondence between the two methods was observed. Most of HSV-1 isolates were in the same range of sensitivity to IFN, while HSV-2 isolates varied in sensitivity and differences approached statistical significance (P = 0.14). No correlation was found between various biological properties, such as plaque size, virulence in baby mice, growth at different temperatures, thymidine kinase activity in the presence or absence of IFN and sensitivity to IFN. Application of beta IFN containing cream reduced clinical symptoms in most of the patients. However, larger numbers of patients should be evaluated in order to conclude whether in vitro sensitivity correlates to clinical improvement.
