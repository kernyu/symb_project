The effectiveness of short-term drug treatment of tuberculosis is based on the use of INH, RMP and PZA (with or without SM or EMB), that have a pronounced bactericidal and sterilizing effect in all tissues and on all populations of mycobacteria which, depending upon the oxygen content and acidity of their surroundings, multiply at different rates. Treatment regimens over 6 or 9 months have proved effective in numerous studies involving 1500 children with pulmonary or extra-pulmonary tuberculosis. The recommended treatment of choice comprises a 6-month regimen with INH, RMP and PZA, with or without EMB or SM, the drugs being administered daily for two months, followed by INH and RMP applied daily, or 2 to 3 times a week for 4 months. If resistance to INH and/or SM is suspected, initially four suitable drugs are required, and are effective. Nine months of treatment with INH and RMP (with PZA and/or EMB if resistance is suspected) administered daily for two months and followed by INH and RMP applied daily or 2 to 3 times a week, is also both effective and safe. Overall side effects were observed in fewer than two per cent of the cases, and were severe in fewer than one per cent. Recurrences occurred in fewer than one per cent of the cases. Complementary measures such as bronchological treatment in the case of bronchial invasion of lymph nodes, and surgical measures in tuberculosis of the bone, joints, body cavities, etc., are of decisive importance for the success of therapy.
