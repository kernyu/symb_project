The multi-drug-resistant strain Streptococcus faecalis BIO-4R was studied to see if it carried a plasmid responsible for antibiotic resistance. From results indicating that the antibiotic resistance of S. faecalis BIO-4R was not transferred to recipient bacteria, that the organism did not produce enzymes which inactivated antibiotics, and that the presence of covalently closed circular DNA was not demonstrated by dye-cesium chloride buoyant density gradient centrifugation, it was concluded that the organism did not carry such a plasmid. Studies on polyphenylalanine synthesis by cell-free extracts of the oganism showed that its ribosomes were resistant to chloramphenicol, tetracycline, streptomycin and kanamycin. These results, although rather indirectly, support the above notion that the multi-drug-resistance of S. faecalis BIO-4R is not mediated by a plasmid.
