Viruses have been established initially as interferon inducers and interferons have been considered to be antiviral proteins only. By our article we wish to draw attention to two observations: a) bacteria and derivatives thereof also are inducing the production of interferon b) interferons activate a number of defense mechanisms that are of potential relevance in antibacterial resistance. These two observations are not new. However, we believe, they deserve renewed attention within the framework of the pleiotropism of interferon effects and of the complexity of antibacterial defense mechanisms.
