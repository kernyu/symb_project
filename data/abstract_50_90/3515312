Quinolones, chemically related to nalidixic acid, have a strong and rapid bactericidal action against Gram-negative bacteria, including Ps. aeruginosa, some Mycobacteria, Legionella and Staphylococci. Streptococci and anaerobic bacteria are usually less sensitive. The quinolones exert their bactericidal action through inhibition of the enzyme DNA gyrase. Quinolones are absorbed for 50-100% from the gastro-intestinal tract, their volume of distribution is generally high (2 l/kg) and high concentrations are reached in almost all organs. The elimination half-lives range from 4 to 14 h. The efficacy of quinolones in urinary tract infections has been shown in many studies. They also seem to be effective in many serious infections. In animal studies their efficacy was generally equal or superior to aminoglycosides. Until now only mild and infrequent side effects have been reported.
