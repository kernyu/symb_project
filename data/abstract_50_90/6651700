A group of 2-week-old turkey poults was inoculated with a pathogenic strain of Alcaligenes faecalis. One week later, half the group was injected with a long-acting oxytetracycline formulation. Poults were examined post-mortem on days 3, 5, and 10 post-treatment. Swabs were taken of the trachea, sinus, and lung of each poult. Poults were observed closely for clinical signs, and appropriate tissues were taken for histopathology. Results showed no evidence of therapeutic effect on A. faecalis infection in vivo, even though the organism was highly sensitive in vitro. Six-week-old turkeys were inoculated intramuscularly with 3.7 X 10(3) organisms of the P-1059 strain of Pasteurella multocida. Immediately following inoculation, half the group was treated with the long-acting oxytetracycline. Ninety percent of the untreated poults were dead 72 hours postinoculation, whereas none of the treated turkeys died. No evidence of any clinical disease was observed in the treated group during the 8-day observation period. The long-acting oxytetracycline product was highly efficacious in preventing disease caused by experimental inoculation with the P-1059 strain of P. multocida.
