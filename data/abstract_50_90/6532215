We have clinically surveyed the distribution and disk sensitivity of bacterial strains obtained from urine of patients with various urological disease at our department during three (1975-1977) and four (1980-1983) years. Escherichia coli was the most frequently isolated (29.4%) from the outpatients, followed by Staphylococcus epidermidis (17.5%), Pseudomonas cepacia (11.2%) and Serratia marcescens (11.2%). Pseudomonas cepacia was the most frequently isolated (28.0%) from the inpatients, followed by Staphylococcus epidermidis (16.3%) and Serratia marcescens (15.9%). Pseudomonas cepacia which has been increasing was first isolated in 1977 and Serratia marcescens in 1976. They have become the main bacteria causing infections in our hospital. Pseudomonas cepacia was frequently isolated after postoperative prophylactic chemotherapy and Serratia marcescens in the late period of admission. The majority of Pseudomonas cepacia was resistant to all agents except chloramphenicol and doxycycline. Serratia marcescens was also resistant except to gentamicin and doxycycline. In Escherichia coli species, resistant strains increased gradually but they have good sensitivity to gentamicin, dibekacin, colistin and doxycycline. Staphylococcus epidermidis isolated from outpatients had good sensitivity to all agents but increased in incidence of resistant strains isolated from inpatients.
