Transposon Tn551 was translocated into the chromosome of a methicillin-resistant (mec) strain of Staphylococcus aureus by heat inactivation of a thermo-sensitive plasmid carrying Tn551 and selection for erythromycin-resistant (Emr) survivors. Two independent chromosomal insertions of Tn551 were obtained which reduced the level of the methicillin resistance by a factor of 50 to 100, making the strains phenotypically methicillin sensitive (Mecs). Each of the Tn551 insertions was on the largest fragment produced by EcoRI digestion of the chromosomal DNA of these strains. The integration sites lie about 1 kilobase apart. These Mecs strains reverted to Mecr at frequencies of 2.4 X 10(-8) and 3.6 X 10(-5), respectively. The majority of Mecr revertants still were Emr; only a few lost the Emr phenotype concomitantly with reversion to the Mecr phenotype. Hybridization data with labeled Tn551 showed complex rearrangements and deletions in the region of the insertion. These two Tn551 insertions do not lie on the same linkage group, II, as the mec determinant. The phenotypic expression of methicillin resistance, therefore, is also dependent upon a chromosomal genetic marker not physically linked to the mec determinant.
