Eight ribosome-binding sites were located on the single-stranded Tn10 DNA loop which was formed after denaturation of lambda phage DNA containing the Tn10 transposon sequence. Ribosomes were bound only to the Tn10 loop contained on the R strand of lambda DNA but not to that on the L strand, suggesting that one of the two strands of Tn10 DNA is selectively transcribed. Six of the eight ribosome binding sites were located in one-half of the DNA loop. The maximum sizes of potential polypeptides were calculated for these genes to range between 9,500 and 84,000 daltons.
