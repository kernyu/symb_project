S. typhimurium mutants with altered sensitivity to fusidic acid (more resistant or more sensitive than the original culture) were selected. The mutants studied changed some of their properties (morphology, antigenic structure, and biochemical activity). They were characterized by a lower growth rate and probably by some alterations in the envelope cell structures- Some mutants acquired cross resistance or sensitivity to other antibiotics. As the mutants were selected by increased resistance or sensitivity to fusidic acid which affected the translocation factor G of the ribosome cycle, such pleiotropic changes of their properties could be due to some alterations in the G-factor itself.
