.15, 0.25 and 0.5 g/kg alcohol in the form of 40% brandy in one week intervals was consumed by eight healthy, regularly trained young men volunteers. Blood alcohol level, blood pressure and ECG were registered before and 30, 60 and 90 min after, each alcohol consumption. The cardiac output was measured with a radiocirculographic method before and 45 min after alcohol consumption. The cardiac index, stroke volume, stroke index, and total peripherial resistance (TPR) were calculated. With increase of the alcohol dose the blood alcohol level increased, while cardiac output, cardiac index, stroke volume, stroke index, and the systolic blood pressure fell. The other parameters examined--heart rate, diastolic blood pressure, TPR among others--remained unchanged. The ECG was normal. The highest no effect alcohol dose was less than 0.15 g/kg (approximately 0.1 g/kg). It is concluded that, depending on the dose, alcohol has practically no effect on the majority of the heart-functions, however, in the range of 0.1 to 0.5 g/kg it has a depressive influence, i.e. lowers the pump-function of the heart and, at 0.5 g/kg the arterial blood pressure. Evaluation of the quantitative and qualitative relationships of dose-effect and dose-response of the human heart following acute alcohol consumption needs experiments with various doses in homogeneous groups as well as toxicological investigations in animals.
