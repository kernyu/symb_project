Three semisynthetic cephamycin antibiotics (7alpha-methoxy-cephalosporins), SK&F 73678, SK&F 83088 (CS-1170) and cefoxitin, have been found to possess favorable biological and chemotherapeutic properties. All three cephamycins are active in vitro against strains of Staphylococcus aureus and a variety of gram-negative bacilli. Beta-lactamase producing organisms including indole-producing Proteus spp., Enterobacter spp. and Serratia strains as well as certain anaerobic bacteria were found to be susceptible to these antibiotics. SK&F 73768 showed somewhat better MIC values than cefoxitin against multiple strains of bacteria. Strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and group D streptococci are essentially insensitive to these compounds. Their binding to serum proteins is relatively low. In mice, cefoxitin showed the most favorable pharmacokinetics with respect to peak serum level, serum half-life and urinary recovery. These cephamycins protected mice experimentally infected with a variety of bacterial strains. All three compounds are rapidly bacteriolytic to the logarithmically growing Escherichia coli and belatedly so to Staphylococcus strains with complete sterilizing effect. SK&F 73678 and SK&F 83088 showed activity and potency comparable to or better than cefoxitin and thus can be considered candidates for clinical study.
