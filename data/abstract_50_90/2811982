The majority of clinical isolates of T. glabrata has been shown highly sensitive to ketoconazole, when tested with an agar dilution method, and resistant, when using a broth dilution method. The fact was accounted for the high degree of mutation associated with the haploid state present in this species. Experimental T. glabrata infection in immunocompetent and immunocompromised mice appears not respond to the oral administration of the drug. The results agree with that of broth dilution tests and not with those produced by the agar methods. It seems that agar dilution sensitivity tests are inadequate for yeast species with an high rate of mutation, as T. glabrata.
