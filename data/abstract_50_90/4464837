1. Chronic oxytetracycline treatment was found to improve the insulin resistance of the obese-hyperglycaemic mouse. 2. The improved response to insulin was accompanied by decreased concentrations of circulating insulin and glucose, by a decrease in the lipid content of the liver and by an increase in the insulin-receptor sites of the liver and adipose tissue. 3. The increase in insulin-receptor sites preceded the fall in blood glucose. 4. Comparable studies done on food-restricted animals indicated that although chronic food restriction corrected the hyperinsulinaemia it did not restore the insulin-receptor sites or the hyperglycaemia.
