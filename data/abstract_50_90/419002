N,N'-bis (3,4 ditrifluoromethylphenyl) methylmalonamide (Sch 18545) completely controlled a mild Eimeria necatrix infection at 50, 40 or 30 p.p.m. in the diet, and controlled E. tenella infections at 50 and 40 p.p.m. Slight oocyst passage was observed at each E. tenella treatment level with a marked increase at the 30 p.p.m. treatment level. Fifty p.p.m. were necessary to control E. acervulina infections; levels of 40 p.p.m. reduced E. acervulina oocyst production while 30 p.p.m. were ineffective. Evaluations of Sch 18545 using a mixed infection (Coccivac D) further suggested that activity with this compound was weakest against E. acervulina. Weight gains decreased with increasing concentration of drug in the diet of treated, infected birds and thus the compound showed an insufficient safety margin to be of practical value. Such 18545 administered at 35 p.p.m. in the diet was effective against amprolium, zoalene, aklomide or nicarbazin-resistant strains of E. tenella.
