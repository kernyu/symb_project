Mutations conferring resistance to low levels of kanamycin in Escherichia coli have been mapped at 3 locations: the unc locus (min. 83), a locus we have designated kanA (MIN. 72), close to strA (rpsL), and a locus at min. 86.5 previously discovered by Plate (1976) that we have designated ecfB. The unc and ecfB mutations are associated with defects in energy metabolism, while mutations at kanA may be in the gene coding for ribosomal protein S12 (rpsL). The three types of mutations cause cross resistance to a number of different aminoglycoside antibiotics and the effects of the mutations are cumulative in combination.
