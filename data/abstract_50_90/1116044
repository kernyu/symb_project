A technique using selective inhibitors was used to estimate the relative contributions of bacterial and fungal populations to the respiration of six soils and one litter sample. The ratios of bacterial to fungal respiration in the four agricultural soils, given in percentage of the total microbial activity, ranged from 10/90 to 35/65, with the average ratio being about 30/70. In the forest soils, the ratios were 20/80 and 30/70, and in a beech litter sample, the ratio was 40/60. The fungi clearly dominated in all samples. The ratios were not found to be pH related. The difficulties which had previously limited the use of selective inhibitors for in situ soil ecological investigations, such as insufficient inhibitor specificity, inhibitor inactivation or degradation, and errors of measurement caused by elimination of competitor populations, were either resolved or methodologically avoided in the experiments. Inhibitor selectivity was demonstrated using both mixed and pure cultures of microorganisms from each soil. Through the use of experiments with short incubation periods (6-8 h), problems with population shifts and inhibitor degradation were eliminated.
