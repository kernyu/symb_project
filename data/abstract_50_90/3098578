Four plasmid patterns were detected in thirteen strains of beta-lactamase-producing Neisseria gonorrhoeae isolated in Greece. Nine strains harbored the 4.5 Mdal penicillin-resistance plasmid with or without a 24.5 Mdal conjugative plasmid, two strains carried the 3.2 Mdal penicillin-resistance plasmid and two strains the new combination of the 3.2 Mdal penicillin-resistance plasmid and the conjugative plasmid (24.5 Mdal). Conjugal transfer experiments between Neisseria gonorrhoeae and E. coli revealed that beta-lactamase activity was acquired by recipient E. coli. The 4.5 and 3.2 Mdal penicillin-resistance plasmids were detected in the transconjugants by agarose gel electrophoresis, but co-transfer of the conjugative plasmid did not occur. The auxotypes and plasmid profiles were also compared.
