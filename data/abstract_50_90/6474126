The incidence of tuberculosis in subjects from countries of the Third World remains higher than that of the adoptive country for many years. This is particularly the case for children. The surveillance and preventive chemotherapy of these populations are therefore important. If chemoprophylaxis or treatment have to be prescribed, it must be remembered that tubercle bacilli of the Third World are often resistant to different antibiotics.
