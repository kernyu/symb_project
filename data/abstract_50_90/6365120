Incubation of E.coli and S. aureus with subinhibitory concentration (1/5 MIC) of cefamandole modified bacterial morphology and resistance to host defence mechanisms. In fact, cefamandole induced filamentous forms of E. coli, when added to the perfusing medium of the isolated rat liver system, were phagocytized at a much fortes rate then control bacteria, but appeared less sensitive to serum bactericidal activity. In contrast, S.aureus, after exposure to the antibiotic, was more sensitive to the bactericidal activity of serum then controls, while treated and untreated cells were phagocytized at the some rate. The data suggest that even at low doses some antibiotics may alter bacterial structure and increase their susceptibility to host factors.
