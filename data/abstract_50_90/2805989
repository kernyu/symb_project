328 bacterial strains were isolated from the surgical patients admitted to the Southwestern Hospital, and their drug sensitivities were tested. Among them, there were 158 strains of aerobic bacteria (47.9%), including 61 strains of E. coli, 21 strains of Proteus, 12 strains of P. aeruginosa, and 170 strains of anaerobic bacteria (52.1%), including 53 strains of B. melaninogenicus, 48 strains of B. fragilis, as well as 19 strains of bacteroides and 24 strains of Fusobacterium. Ceftazidime was highly effective against gram-negative bacteria, such as E. coli, P. aeruginosa, Serratia and Klebsiella. Metronidazole was effective against B. fragilis, Bacteroides and Fusobacterium. Combination of amikacin or gentamycin and metronidazole were more effective.
