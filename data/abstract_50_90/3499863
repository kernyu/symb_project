Of 27 unique clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, only 4 were homogeneously resistant, and all 4 produced little or no beta-lactamase. Among heterogeneously resistant strains, those most resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics produced the most beta-lactamase. Similar genes may regulate production of the low-affinity penicillin-binding protein and beta-lactamase.
