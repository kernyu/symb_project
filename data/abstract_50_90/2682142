Oxygen deficiency was shown to affect the resistance of different Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains to nystatin, a polyenic antibiotic. This resistance decreased upon oxygen deficiency in the wild-type strains alpha'1 and 7A-P192 as well as in the mutant strains NYS 2, NYS 3 and NYS 4, but remained unchanged in the mutants NYS-1 and NYS 5. The qualitative composition of sterols was studied in the strains with a modified ergosterol synthesis, which were grown under the conditions of oxygen deficiency. Such conditions exerted a considerable effect on the accumulation of intermediate products in ergosterol biosynthesis.
