Blepharoconjunctivitis caused by methicillin-resistant strains of Staphylococcus epidermidis occurred in two hospitalized patients, a 74-year-old man and a 19-year-old man. Both strains were resistant to multiple courses of topical antibiotic therapy. Successful treatment in both cases depended upon antibiotic sensitivity testing. These methicillin-resistant strains of S. epidermidis, like methicillin-resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus, demonstrated almost complete cross-resistance to cephalosporins despite apparent sensitivity on Kirby-Bauer disk sensitivity testing. Topical vancomycin was curative in one case. In the other case, treatment with topical gentamicin, intravenous cefoperazone, and oral rifampin led to resolution of the symptoms.
