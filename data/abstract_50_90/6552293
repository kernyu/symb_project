Clinical studies with long acting amoxicillin (L-AMPC) have been carried out and the following results were obtained. 1. Forty-two patients with acute bacterial infections in the oral region were administrated orally L-AMPC at a daily dose of 1 gram. The clinical results obtained were classified as excellent in 3 cases, good in 28 cases, and the overall efficacy was 75.6%. 2. The antibacterial activity of AMPC was determined for 66 strains isolated from patients with oral infections. Of the strains tested, Gram positive cocci showed high sensitivity with MIC's less than 1.56 mcg/ml, while the sensitivity of PC resistance strains of S. aureus, K. pneumoniae and P. vulgaris was lower. 3.
