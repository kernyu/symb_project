Bacteriological examination and evaluation of 475 smears of pus taken from odontogenous abcesses showed that the spectrum of pathogens is extremely broad. Chemotherapy therefore should not be started before the pathogen has been identified and an antibiogram has been made due to possible resistance on the part of the microorganisms. Clindamycin may be used for "blind treatment" until the bacteriologic findings are available because it is effective against streptococcus and staphylococcus as well as gram-negative asporous anaerobes. The risk of the possible ineffectiveness of clindamycin against gramnegative anaerobes however must be taken. Clindamycin and gentamicin together may be helpful in life-threatening situations because the combination covers an extremely broad spectrum of possible pathogens.
