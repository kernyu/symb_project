Investigations were performed to study whether soluble factors produced by NK-cells could mediate "hybrid resistance" in vitro. NK-cells enriched from spleens of B6D2F1 hybrid mice were incubated with parental B6 bone marrow, and the effect of the derived supernatants on the development of granulocyte-macrophage colony forming cells (GM-CFC) was assessed. Cell free supernatants obtained from low density cells (LDC) of B6D2F1 hybrids stimulated with bone marrow cells (BMC) from B6 mice inhibited GM-CFC formation. The inhibition was similar using B6, D2 or B6D2F1 bone marrow cells as the targets for GM-CFC growth. Our findings suggest that NK cells from F1 hybrid mice when stimulated with BMC from B6 mice release inhibitory factors, different from IFN-gamma and that this production may represent a mechanism of natural resistance to parental H-2b bone marrow grafts.
