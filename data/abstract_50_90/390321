Synergistic antibiotic studies were undertaken to compare the effectiveness of two new beta-lactamase resistant cephalosporins, cefamandole, and carbenicillin, with four aminoglycosides against clinical strains of Serratia marcescens. The strains demonstrated various combinations of resistance and/or susceptibility to the antibiotics tested. Tobramycin was the most effective aminoglycoside when used in combination with beta-lactam antibiotics. Carbenicillin and cefamandole demonstrated similar activity with aminoglycosides in synergy experiments. Tobramycin-carbenicillin was found to be the superior pairs as indicated by the total number of strains inhibited. This combination was the only one effective against certain high drug resistant strains and the strain resistant to all four aminoglycosides. Carbenicillin or cefamandole with tobramycin exhibited comparable activity against multiple drug resistant organisms. However, mutants significantly more resistant to cefamandole developed during susceptibility testing. The findings of this study have clinical relevance for treating infections by this formidable pathogen.
