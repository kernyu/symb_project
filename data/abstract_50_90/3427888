Fifty-four clinical isolates of Nocardia spp. were tested in vitro for susceptibility to several antimicrobial agents. Of these, 89% were susceptible to ciprofloxacin, 86% to imipenem, 85% to fusidic acid, and 71% to cefotaxime. Some of the agents may be suitable alternative or adjunctive drugs to sulfonamides and aminoglycosides for chemotherapy of Nocardial infections.
