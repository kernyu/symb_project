The surviving populations of Campylobacter jejuni serotypes following freezing or heat were found to be more sensitive to rifampicin and sodium deoxycholate on subsequent culture. Thus while control cultures had an IC50 of greater than 20 micrograms/ml rifampicin those of injured cells were less than 5 micrograms/ml. Treatment with EDTA caused almost identical changes in resistance suggesting that the altered resistance pattern of injured cells was due to loss of the barrier properties of the bacterial outer membrane.
