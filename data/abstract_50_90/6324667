SK&F 21681 (3,10-dimethyl-10-H-s-triazolo[4',3':2,3]-as-triazino-[ 5,6-b]indole) is an inhibitor of the growth of herpes simplex viruses types 1 and 2 at a concentration of 60 micrograms/ml. It inhibits the synthesis of the viral DNA and the formation of virus particles, although the viral polypeptide synthesis is not significantly affected by this compound. Mutants of herpes simplex viruses types 1 and 2 which are able to grow in the presence of SK&F 21681 were isolated. They induced normal levels of thymidine kinase and DNA polymerase activities in the infected cells and did not show resistance to either 9-[2-hydroxyethoxymethyl] guanine or phosphonoacetic acid.
