A new scheme for identification of coagulase-negative staphylococci was applied to 138 consecutive urinary isolates of coagulase-negative staphylococci. The most common species were Staphylococcus epidermidis (53%), S. hominis (12%), and S. haemolyticus (10%). S. saprophyticus comprised only 5%. The disk method for antibiotic susceptibility for all species grouped together disclosed resistance most commonly to penicillin (35%), tetracycline (33%), methicillin (27%), and sulfonamide (24%). This pattern was also seen specifically with S. epidermidis. Further studies are needed to determine the incidence of species-specific antibiotic resistance and species-specific infection by site. This may be of particular interest in those patients with nosocomial infections due to coagulase-negative staphylococci.
