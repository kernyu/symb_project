Recombinations which lost their invasive properties were obtained by crossing E. coli K12Hfr AB313 with entropathogenic escherichia belonging to serological group 0124. The loss of invasive properties by these recombinations was not connected with the acquisition of genes controlling the streptomycin resistance.
