Cefotiam, one of the new cephem antibiotics, was used in 14 cases with pediatric infections: (10 cases with respiratory tract infections, 2 with urinary tract infections, each 1 with purulent meningitis + sepsis and acute appendicitis). The patients were aged between 15 days and 9 years old. The drug was, a rule, given at a daily dose of 50 mg/kg to 100 mg/kg q.i.d. by bolus intravenous injection. The duration of treatment was between 3 and 38 days. The treatment produced the following clinical responses: Out of the 10 cases, good response in 7 with respiratory tract infections, fair in 1 and poor in the remaining 2. The responses in urinary tract infections were excellent in 1 and good in the other case. An apparently clear response was obtained in 1 case with purulent meningitis + sepsis due to K. pneumoniae. Also, an excellent response was seen in 1 case with acute appendicitis. The response rate including fair response was 85.7%. The suspected pathogens isolated from 5 cases (S. aureus: 1. strain, H. influenzae: 1, K. pneumoniae 2, E. coli: 1) were eliminated after CTM administration. Good clinical responses were also obtained in these cases. No side effect was observed. Mild elevation of GOT and GPT was noted during the treatment in 1 case. It is unclear, however, if CTM was associated with this side effect or not. P. aeruginosa, Serratia appeared after superinfection in 1 case.
