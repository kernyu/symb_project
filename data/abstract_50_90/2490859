The activity of clofazimine, amikacin, roxithromycin, rifampicin and rifapentine was tested, alone and in association, against Mycobacterium avium intracellulare. Clofazimine, amikacin and rifapentine were shown to be very active. With all established associations, the MIC observed for each drug alone was appreciably reduced.
