Empiric treatment of serious Salmonella infections has been complicated by the emergence of strains resistant to multiple antimicrobial agents, including ampicillin, chloramphenicol, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Recent reports suggest that the third-generation cephalosporins may be effective therapy for Salmonella infections. This report describes a case of antibiotic-resistant Salmonella heidelberg prosthetic hip infection successfully treated with prosthesis removal and once-daily ceftriaxone. Tube dilution sensitivity testing of the organism demonstrated minimal inhibitory and minimal bactericidal concentrations of 0.12 microgram/ml. Serum bactericidal activity, 30 minutes after infusion, was inhibitory and bactericidal at 1:512. It is concluded that the favorable preliminary results reported in the literature and the outcome in this patient suggest that the third-generation cephalosporins may be effective therapy for Salmonella infections and should undergo clinical trials.
