The method for obtaining nonlysogenic bacteria from lysogenic ones by means of a phage carrying resistance to antibiotics is proposed. Solitary nonlysogenic cells in a lysogenic culture are lysogenized after the infection of the culture with a labeled phage and then harvested on a selective medium: under special conditions the phage is eliminated from the cells.
