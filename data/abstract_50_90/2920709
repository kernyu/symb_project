This study from the Sidamo Regional Hospital presents the prevailing sensitivity to common antimicrobials among 337 bacterial isolates from abscesses, infected wounds, urine or gonorrhoeal infections. As expected, Staphylococcus aureus Escherichia cloi, Proteus supp and Streptococcus pyogenes were most frequently grown from abscesses and infected wounds, whereas E. coli, Proteus spp, Klebsiella spp, and coagulase negative staphylococci dominated in urinary tract infections. Very high rates of reduced sensitivity, including multiresistance to commonly used antibiotics, were detected. Of 54 isolates of Niesseria gonorrhoeae 84% were resistant to penicillin-G by disc diffusion method. Beta lactamase production was detected in 4 of 6 isolates tested.
