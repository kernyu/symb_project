Bacteriophage phi-gamma is capable of transducing long segments from hybrids R,Col,Trp plasmids carrying its prophage attachment site, even in absence of definite integration therein. Transductants inherite segments adjacent to the attachment site which may comprise determinants of drug resistance and of colicinogeny. Presence of a related plasmid in the recipient may have a helping effect probably in allowing recombination of the transduced genes with a replicon.
