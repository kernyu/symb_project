Biochemical activity of the guinea pig leucocytes phagocyting live antibiotic sensitive and resistant bacteria was studied in vitro. The results of the study showed that the leucocytes which had absorbed live Staph. aureus and E. coli sensitive and resistant to be benzylpenicillin and levomycetin respectively differed in increased contents of nucleic acids. The increase was due to higher contents of RNA. The activity of dehydrogenases, acid and alkaline phosphatases was markedly inhibited. The use of oxygen and lipase activity did not differ from the control in the experiments with phagocytosis of both Staph. aureus and E. coli. The activity of peroxidase and catalase in the experiments with phagocytosis of E. coli did not differ from the control, while in the experiments with phagocytosis of Staph. aureus it increased. The data testified to the fact that the enzymatic activity of the phagocytes changed when they absorbed the objects of phagocytosis, the changes in the biochemical activity being dependent on the nature of the antigen and its state.
