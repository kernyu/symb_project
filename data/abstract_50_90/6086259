pJRD158 is a small plasmid vector (3903 bp) derived from pBR327 and specifying resistance to ampicillin and tetracycline. It contains 28 unique restriction sites (and 4 nonunique restriction sites) that can be used for cloning. The DNA sequence and computer-assisted restriction site analysis of pJRD158 are reported. Evidence is also presented that suggests a 2-bp revision of the DNA sequence of pBR322 in the RNA primer region.
