A genetic map of the W incompatibility group plasmid pSa has been prepared through the construction of deletion derivatives of pSa and the cloning of various fragments of pSa in pBR322. Phenotypic analysis of these derivatives has identified the location of genes encoding resistance to chloramphenicol, sulfonamides, spectinomycin, streptomycin, kanamycin, gentamycin, and tobramycin. Information sufficient for the replication of the plasmid in both Escherichia coli and Agrobacterium tumefaciens is contained within a 4 kilobase pair region. Two regions have been identified as involved in the transfer of the plasmid; one of these regions is also involved in the inhibition of oncogenesis by pSa when it is present in an oncogenic strain of A. tumefaciens. Certain of the deletion derivatives of pSa are potential vectors for the cloning and analysis of A. tumefaciens Ti plasmid DNA.
