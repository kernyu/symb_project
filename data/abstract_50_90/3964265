Comparison of the cyanide-resistant duroquinol oxidase activity of sub-mitochondrial particles from Arum maculatum L. with their ability to carry out a cyanide-resistant oxidation of NADH and succinate shows that heat-inactivation of the duroquinol oxidase activity does not proportionally affect NADH and succinate oxidation. Moreover, 1 microM antimycin inhibits duroquinol oxidase activity by 50% while not decreasing the rates of NADH and succinate oxidation. Therefore, the cyanide-resistant electron transport does not appear to be mediated by a "duroquinol oxidase", and a convincing proof of the existence of a specific protein acting as a cyanide-resistant oxidase in plant mitochondria is still lacking.
