Ten parasite-free experimental lambs were inoculated intraruminally with a mixed-larvae inoculum which contained approximately 5,000 Haemonchus contortus infective larvae. Five lambs were treated with thiabendazole (66 mg/kg of body weight) and 5 were untreated controls. All lambs were killed 35 days after inoculations were done, and parasites present were recovered. Reduction in numbers of recovered Haemonchus contortus (25.7%) and Ostertagia spp (26.8%) were not significant (P greater than 0.05).
