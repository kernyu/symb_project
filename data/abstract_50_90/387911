The denaturation map of EcoRI-digested pCR11, a ColE1-Km plasmid, is described. The 2.0 kilobase ColE1-derived segment contains an adenine+thymine rich site in the colicin immunity gene region. In the 7.2 kilobase kanamycin resistance region, the transposon Tn903 consists of an adenine+thymine rich 0.98 kilobase kan gene region flanked by a guanine+cytosine rich 1.09 kilobase inverted duplication.
