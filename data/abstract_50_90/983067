An attempt was made to interpret the therapeutic and biological effects of iodine on the basis of currently available biophysical information. The easily facilitated electron transfer from and to the external shell of the iodine atom is considered to account, first of all, for good tissue compatibility of molecular iodine as an oxidizing antiseptic, secondly, for the role of iodine as a biocatalyzer of oxidation and reduction processes, thirdly, for the role of iodine as an agent lowering the electric resistance of membranes and, finally, for a possible intracellular release of iodine from iodine-containing hormones and amino acids, thereby affecting enzyme activities. A low electrostatic charge density of iodide and, hence, a small ionic hydration shell imply two biologically significant facts: an intensified ionic mobility and a breaking of the immediate water structure (chaotropy). These physical phenomena are thought to be well suited to explain the strong binding capacity of iodide to proteins, the loosening of electrostatic and hydrophobic bonds within the tissues and an overall increase in protein solubility.
