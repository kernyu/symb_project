Studied was the reaction streptomycin-dependent and streptomycin-resistant mutants and their revertants of the Escherichia coli strains 078:K80, 02:K1, and 0111:K58 to the following, practically important antibiotics: rifampicin, novobiocin, chloramphenicol, and penicillin. The study made use of mutants of both smooth (S) and rough (R) form obtained through induced mutagenesis effected by means of nitrosoguanidine and nitrous acid. The method of serial dilution of antibiotics and that of dynamic recording of their action through automatic biophotometry were employed. Negligible differences were established in the behaviour of the various groups of organisms. The streptomycin - dependent mutants retained unchanged the reaction of the initial strains to the antibiotics. The revertants showed high level of of resistance to streptomycin and by their behaviour they were closer to the streptomycin - resistant mutants than to the initial strains. In connection with this the probability is discussed of the "suppressor" origin of the streptomycin-dependent mutants.
