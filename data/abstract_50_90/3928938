Cefminox (CMNX, MT-141) was evaluated for its safety and efficacy in children. Fifteen cases of bacterial infections were treated with intravenous bolus injections of 30 to 100 mg/kg/day of CMNX. Each 5 cases of acute respiratory tract, urinary tract, and gastrointestinal infections were included. All the cases were cured after the CMNX therapy. No adverse reactions were encountered with the therapy. The serum half-life was approximately 1.5 to 2 hours after intravenous bolus injection in children. The data suggest that CMNX is a safe and effective antibiotic when used in children with susceptible bacterial infections.
