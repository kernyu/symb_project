Antibacterial activity of dioxidine against aerobic and facultative anaerobic organisms under conditions of anaerobiosis i. e. conditions really observed for example in abscess cavities or necrotic tissues is 30 to 100 times as high as that under aerobic conditions. There is a relationship between sensitivity of bacteria to dioxidine under aerobic and anaerobic conditions which is expressed by the regression equation. Therefore, comparison of the MICs determined under anaerobic conditions with the growth inhibition zones formed by disks with the drug under aerobic conditions is possible. The MIC of dioxidine was determined under anaerobic conditions for 179 clinical strains of aerobic and facultative anaerobic bacteria and the growth inhibition zones of the same bacteria under aerobic conditions were evaluated with the use of disks containing 100, 75, 50, 25, 20, and 15 micrograms of the drug. The border line. MIC differentiating between resistant and sensitive strains was chosen to be equal to 4 micrograms/ml. Differentiation of the strains into sensitive and resistant ones by the values of the growth inhibition zones was performed with the method of error minimization described by C. Metzler and R. De Haan in 1974. Disks containing 25 micrograms of the drug allowed one to differentiate the strains under aerobic conditions into sensitive and resistant ones: the growth inhibition zones greater than 11 mm corresponded to the sensitive strains (the MIC smaller than 4 micrograms/ml) and the growth inhibition zones smaller than 11 mm corresponded to the resistant strains (the MIC greater than 4 micrograms/ml).
