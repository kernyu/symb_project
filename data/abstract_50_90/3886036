Plasmid stability was studied in antibiotic-free chemostat cultures. Disruption, either by deletion or insertion, of the tetracycline resistance gene in the EcoR1/EcoRV region of the cloning vector pBR322 or in the HindIII/BamH1 region of pACYC184 yields plasmids markedly more stable than the parent plasmids. Thus, at least for these two instances, cloning of a partitioning (par) locus is not prerequisite for plasmid maintenance.
