Hydroxyurea induces mitotic gene conversion, mitotic crossing-over, reverse mutation, respiration-deficient petite mutants and aneuploidy in growing cultures of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Evidence is presented indicating that induction rather than selection is responsible for the increase in frequency of the genetic end points measured. Complications concerning the detection of aneuploidy in the presence of other genetic effects are described, and the need for following the complete protocol for confirmation of the aneuploids in any chemical screening program is emphasized.
