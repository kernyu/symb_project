A pBR322:RSF1010 composite plasmid, constructed in vitro, was used as a cloning vector in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. This nonamplifiable plasmid, pMW79, has a molecular weight of 8.4 X 10(6) and exists as a multicopy plasmid in both P. aeruginosa and Escherichia coli. In P. aeruginosa strain PAO2003, pMW79 conferred resistance to carbenicillin and tetracycline. Characterization of pMW79 with restriction enzymes revealed that four enzymes (BamHI, SalI, HindIII, and HpaI) cleaved the plasmid at unique restriction sites. Cloning P. aeruginosa chromosomal deoxyribonucleic acid fragments into the BamHI or SalI site of pMW79 inactivated the tetracycline resistance gene. Thus, cells carrying recombinant plasmids could be identified by their carbenicillin resistance, tetracycline sensitivity phenotype. Deoxyribonucleic acid fragments of approximately 0.5 to 7.0 megadaltons were inserted into pMW79, and the recombinant plasmids were stably maintained in a recombination-deficient (recA) P. aeruginosa host.
