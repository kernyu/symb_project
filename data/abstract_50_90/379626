UV efficiently induces mutations in mitDNA , conferring resistance to erythromycin. Mitochondrial chloramphenicol-resistant mutants are probably also induced by UV, but almost 90% of mutants with such phenotype are non-mitochondrial; therefore it is possible to estimate accurately the frequences of the induced presumptive mitochondrial capr mutations.
