Various detergents and EPR-probes of 4,4-dimethylspiro[5alpha-androstan-17beta-ol-3,2-(1,3-oxazolidin-3-oxyl)]2CH3OH; 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpalmitoyl-amidopiperidine-1-oxyl and 2-(14-carboxytetradecyl)-2-ethyl-4,4-dimethyl-3-oxazolidinoxyl were used to establish structural differences in the membrane of polyene-sensitive and polyene-resistant strains of C. albicans. It was shown that the type of protein-lipid interactions is modified by the changes in the sterol component of the polyene-resistant strain membranes. This manifests itself in a decrease in sensitivity of membrane alkaline phosphatase for levorin and the detergents, as well as in the alteration of the lipid fluidity pattern of the polyene-resistant strain membranes as compared to the membranes of original culture of C. albicans. Treatment of polyene-sensitive strain membranes with amphotericine B causes more intensive protein-lipid interactions, which is not observed in case of the polyene-resistant strain. It is assumed that C. albicans resistance to polyenes is due to the existence of strong protein-lipid interactions in the membrane coupled with ergosterol substitution by other sterol components.
