Human cells incubated with human interferon become more resistant to vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) than to Semliki Forest virus (SFV); monkey cells treated with monkey interferon become more resistant to SFV than to VSV. However, monkey cells incubated with human interferon developed relative antiviral activity identical to that induced by homologous interferon, and human cells developed characteristic human interferon-induced relative antiviral activity when exposed to monkey interferon. Therefore, cross-reacting interferons induce the relative antiviral activity characteristic of the interferon-treated cell rather than the cell of the interferon's origin. This relationship supports the hypothesis that interferon is not itself antiviral but rather induces cells to develop their own antiviral activity.
