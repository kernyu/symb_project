Strains of Neisseria gonorrhoeae from a variety of sources were examined for sensitivity to 11 partially purified R-type pyocines from Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Selective inhibition of gonococci by pyocines of Kageyama groups R1 and R5 was observed. "Matched isolates", those from consorts or different body sites of individual patients, usually had very similar pyocine-sensitivity patterns and identical sensitivities to five antibiotics tested. This study included local isolates, strains from diverse geographic regions, and strains from disseminated gonococcal infections. It also proposed a relationship between pyocine-receptor sites in the lipopolysaccharide of Ps. aeruginosa and N. gonorrhoeae. Topics needing further evaluation are discussed.
