A case of methicillin-resistant staphylococcal (MRSA) enterocolitis following combination chemotherapy for acute promyelocytic leukemia is presented. MRSA enterocolitis has characteristic clinical features of high fever, frequent vomiting and watery diarrhea, and its mortality rate is very high without a proper antibiotic therapy. When the patient with hematological malignancy has the above-mentioned clinical manifestations during antineoplastic chemotherapy, appropriate antibiotics for MRSA should be promptly begun before a bacteriological diagnosis.
