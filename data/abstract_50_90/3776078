Two field strains of Trichostrongylus colubriformis were tested by in vitro and in vivo methods for resistance to morantel, levamisole and thiabendazole and compared with an anthelmintic-naive laboratory-passaged strain (McM). One field strain (TAS) was isolated from a dairy goat herd which had experienced severe helminthiasis despite intensive anthelmintic usage. The other (BCK) was isolated from sheep which had been treated solely with levamisole over a 6-year period. The BCK strain had very high levels of both levamisole and morantel resistance. In contrast the TAS strain was resistant to morantel but highly susceptible to levamisole. This finding is contrary to the expectation that selection with morantel automatically confers resistance to levamisole, the converse of which was shown to apply in the BCK strain. Although the TAS strain was exposed to levamisole prior to isolation, examination of the drug's pharmacokinetics in goats indicated that it exerted little if any anthelmintic effect, and therefore selection pressure, on the parasite population. This study suggests that the mechanism of levamisole resistance covers a wide spectrum, and embraces that for morantel. It also suggests that in order to conserve the effectiveness of the levamisole/morantel group of broad spectrum anthelmintics, morantel should be used to the exclusion of levamisole until resistance is detected, at which time levamisole may be introduced to re-establish high levels of control.
