Detailed examination of the structure of cloned DNA fragments of the R6-5 antibiotic resistance plasmid has revealed a substantial degree of polynucleotide sequence heterogeneity and indicates that sequence rearrangements in plasmids and possible other replicons occur more frequently than has hitherto been appreciated. The sequences changes in cloned R6-5 fragments were shown in some instances to have occurred prior to cloning, i.e. existing in the original population of R6-5 molecules that was obtained from a single bacterial clone and by several different criteria judged to be homogeneous, and in others to have occurred either during the cloning procedure or during subsequent propagation of hybrid molecules. The molecular changes that are described involved insertion/deletion of the previously characterized IS2 insertion element, formation of a new inverted repeat structure probably by duplication of a preexisting R6-5 DNA sequence, sequence inversion, and loss and gain of restriction endonuclease cleavage sites.
