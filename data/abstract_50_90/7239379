In this study type and occurrence of microorganisms in gallbladder and choledochal bile are compared to results of other authors. The value of antibiotic therapy in acute cystic duct obstruction in a clinical study and in animal experiments are discussed. Efficacy of different antibiotic substances (mezlocillin, cefazolin, cefotaxim, rolitetracyclin and aminoglycosides) are measured by means of the reduction in colony count in T-tube bile. Antibiotic effect was least when tetracyclines and aminoglycosides were given. Beta-lactam antibiotics caused marked reduction and even elimination of bacteria in choledochal bile. Antibiotic therapy for the treatment of bacterial infection of the bile is reasonable only after decompression of the biliary tract in the presence of obstructive jaundice. In case of cystic duct obstruction antibiotic therapy is uncertain.
