A 4.8 X 10(6) dalton ECoRI-generated fragment of the R-factor R6-5 carrying the gene for kanamycin resistance (Km) was joined in vitro to ECoRI-treated ColE1 plasmid DNA. Transformation of E. coli with the ColE1-Km recombinant plasmid yielded clones, which were immune to colicin E1, resistant to kanamycin and failed to produce colicin E1. During multiplication of this recombinant plasmid in the presence of chloramphenicol, cells expressed an increased resistance to kanamycin. Transformation studies with the recombinant DNA molecule showed very frequent loss of Km resistance in those cells harbouring a preexisting F'gal plasmid. Since colicin immunity is not affected and the col- phenotype is still present, one has to test for a remaining DNA sequence further existing in ColE1 DNA by cleaving the plasmid DNA with the ECoRI restriction endonuclease. The full length of ColE1 DNA (6.2 kb) was restored, which confirmed that no deletion of ColE1 DNA sequences had occured. The remaining DNA sequence was identified as a 2.0 or 2.2 kb segment. On the basis of the length of the excised fragment it is proposed that the insertion sequence ISI and a part of the inverted repeat sequence with corrdinates 21.0 to 22.0 of the R6-5 DNA are recognised by a nucleolytic function.
