Caecal samples were collected from 751 domestic rabbits of various origin and from 1229 diarrhoeic rabbits issued from 61 commercial rabbitries. They were screened for coccidiosis. In 1982, the year of introduction of the anticoccidial robenidine in commercial rabbit feeds, a dramatic decrease of coccidial infection ratio was detected in commercial rabbitries: only 6% of samples contained greater than 100 oocysts per gram against 85% in 1979, when sulphaquinoxaline/pyrimethamine was used. Only Eimeria magna, E. media and E. perforans were detected, whereas the highly pathogenic species E. flavescens and E. intestinalis had disappeared from commercial units. After 4 years of continuous use of robenidine, infection ratio rose progressively, although still far below the 1979 levels. Most of the other species reappeared, but only in very low proportions (1-4% of samples). The percentage occurrence of E. magna, E. media and E. perforans on the contrary rose progressively to 25, 26 and 34%, respectively, suggesting drug resistance. In domestic rabbitries, the incidence of coccidial infection was markedly higher and all nine species of Eimeria were detected. Eimeria magna, E. media and E. perforans were very common, E. flavescens, E. intestinalis, E. piriformis and E. stiedai were less common, whereas E. irresidua and E. coecicola were relatively rare. Notwithstanding the lower activity of robenidine against E. stiedai, no rise of hepatic coccidiosis became evident.
