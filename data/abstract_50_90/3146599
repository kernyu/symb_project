The diagnostic value of a new, modified enzyme immunoassay (EIA) (Gonozyme; Abbott Laboratories, North Chicago III) was evaluated for the rapid antigenic detection of Neisseria gonorrhoeae in endocervical and urethral specimens. EIA results were compared with those of Gram stain (GS) and conventional culture tests. EIA sensitivity and specificity for male patients attending dermatovenerological clinic were 100% and 96.8% respectively in comparison to 86.7% and 96.8% obtained by Gram staining. For female Obstetrics-Gynaecology patients EIA sensitivity of 100% was highly significant compared to 50% sensitivity by the Gram stain. In culture, 30 strains of N. gonorrhoeae were isolated from 125 male specimens and 2 from 105 specimens from females; this suggests a prevalence of N. gonorrhoeae of 24% in males and 1.9% in females. In vitro antibiotic sensitivity testing indicated 55% resistance to penicillin and 43% to ampicillin in these isolated strains; all were sensitive to erythromycin/tetracycline. 12% of the strains were beta-lactamase producers.
