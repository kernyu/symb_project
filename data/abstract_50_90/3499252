2-Bromo-2'-deoxyadenosine (BdA) is one of a group of recently synthesised halogenated deoxyadenosine analogues that are relatively resistant to inactivation by adenosine deaminase (ADA). Its activity has been studied in human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in vitro. In these studies BdA behaved as a cycle-active, phase-active agent that blocked cells at the G1-S transition. It did not exhibit significant cross-resistance with cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C) in either clinical AML samples (from patients who exhibited Ara-C resistance in vivo) or in HL60 in which Ara-C resistance had been induced in vitro. Deoxycytidine kinase levels were not reduced in resistant lines. Erythro-9-(2-hydroxy-3-nonyl)adenine (EHNA), an adenosine deaminase (ADA) inhibitor, with BdA produced a simple additive response without the dramatic synergism reported when it is used with deoxyadenosine. This is consistent with the idea that BdA is a poor substrate for ADA. This group of compounds warrants further investigation to determine their suitability for clinical use, especially in situations where Ara-C resistance is likely to be a problem.
