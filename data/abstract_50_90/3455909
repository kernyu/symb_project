A case of Flavobacterium meningosepticum bacteremia complicating the course of a patient with leukemia is described. The patient was treated successfully when rifampin was added to the antibiotic therapy. Unusual organisms should be considered as agents of infection in immunocompromised hosts and susceptibility testing with drugs not commonly employed for gram-negative rods should be performed in complicated cases.
