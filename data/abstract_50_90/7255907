Low-dose daily phenothiazine therapy, administered as a 1:40 phenothiazine:molasses mixture, was tested against sequential infections of strains of Haemonchus contortus. Trichostrongylus colubriformis and Ostertagia spp susceptible or resistant to thiabendazole, levamisole and morantel tartrate. Phenothiazine at a dose rate of 0.5 g per sheep per day significantly reduced the numbers of worm eggs per gram of faeces in both susceptible and resistant strains by an average of 48 per cent and 60 per cent respectively. Phenothiazine completely inhibited larval production in susceptible strains. With resistant worms, larval production was depressed by up to 85.7 per cent. Treatment with phenothiazine : molasses mixture reduced the numbers of worms which became established in resistant Ostertagia spp and susceptible T colubriformis but had no effect on the establishment of susceptible H contortus and Ostertagia spp or resistant H contortus and T colubriformis.
