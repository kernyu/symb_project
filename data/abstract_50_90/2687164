Out of 3001 salmonella received during 1984-85, 2985 strains were tested for antibiotic resistance and R-pattern transfer. Multidrug resistance was observed in 73% of diarrhoeal and 43% of non-diarrhoeal isolates. Antibiotic resistance markers were transferable in 46.6% of diarrhoeal and 41.1% of non-diarrhoeal isolates. Two out of 4 salmonella sero-types isolated for the first time in India during this period were multidrug resistant.
