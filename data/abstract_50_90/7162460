The sensitivity of leukemic colony forming units to exposure to cytosine arabinoside in vitro was measured for both acute myelocytic leukemia cells and for chronic myelocytic leukemia cells. There was significant variability in the sensitivity of the leukemic cells of different patients. By simultaneous measurement of the sensitivity of leukemic clonogenic cells to 3H-TdR one can distinguish between metabolic and cell cycle kinetic resistance to cytosine arabinoside.
