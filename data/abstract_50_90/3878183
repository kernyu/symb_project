Striatal monoamine oxidase (MAO)-B, but not MAO-A, activity decreased in mice at 2 and 10 days and was back to control values at 20 and 30 days after systemic administration of N-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,5,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). Striatal dopaminergic (DA) depletions were maximal at 2 days and were only partially reversed at 30 days post-treatment. In rats, unilateral kainic acid lesions increased MAO-B but not MAO-A activity probably due to reactive gliosis, but MPTP did not affect DA levels in control and kainic acid-lesioned striata. Findings support the importance of MAO-B in the toxicity of MPTP and suggest that resistance of rat DA neurons to the neurotoxin is probably not due to species differences in MAO-B activity.
