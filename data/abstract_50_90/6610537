Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia is a well-known complication of immunosuppression in renal transplant recipients. Treatment is generally with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMZ). A case of Pneumocystis pneumonia failed to respond to TMP-SMZ until concomitant administration of folinic acid was stopped. Physicians should be alerted to the possibility that folinic acid may impair the efficacy of TMP-SMZ in Pneumocystis carinii infection.
