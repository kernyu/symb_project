The literature data and personal observations of the authors on the effect of the inoculate amount on the results of determination of microbial sensitivity to antibiotics by the methods of serial dilutions in the liquid and solid nutrient media and agar diffusion are discussed. It was shown that the inoculate of the density of 3.6.10(7) to 4.25.10(7) microbial bodies per 1 ml was optimal for the methods of agar diffusion and serial dilutions in agar. Recommendations for simplifying standardization and dilution of the inoculate are presented.
