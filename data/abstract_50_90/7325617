The antimicrobial properties of two cationic detergents, i.e. rockal, an antiseptic made in England and catamine AB, its analog made in the USSR were compared. It was found that catamine AB and rockal did not practically differ by their bacteriostatic and mycostatic activities with respect to collection and clinical strains of bacteria with multiple resistance to antibiotics. Both detergents were shown to be identical by their membranotropic activity and thus catamine AB may be used instead of rockal as an antiseptic.
