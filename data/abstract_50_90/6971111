The synthesis and the trichomonacidal activity of some 4-substituted 2-imidazolylquinazoline derivatives are described. The new compounds were highly active against metronidazole-sensitive and metronidazole-resistant strains of trichomonads. This was demonstrated in vitro as well as in various trichomoniasis models in mice and rats after oral treatment.
