Clinical trials were carried out on the use of sulbactam/ampicillin (SBT/ABPC) (combination rate of 1:2) in pediatric infections. Results were as follows: 1. The mean half-lives of SBT and ABPC in the serum following intravenous injection of SBT/ABPC were about 1.05 and 0.90 hours, respectively. 2. The mean urinary excretions of SBT and ABPC in 6 hours after intravenous injection of SBT/ABPC were 71.2% and 62.2%, respectively. 3. SBT/ABPC was administered to 23 pediatric patients with various infections: 17 patients with pneumonia, 3 with tonsillitis, 2 with urinary tract infection and 1 with cervical lymphadenitis. The overall efficacy rate was 95.7%. In particular, 2 urinary tract infections caused by highly beta-lactamase producing Escherichia coli were improved by the treatment with SBT/ABPC. 4. No adverse reactions were observed except 2 cases of mild diarrhea. Abnormal laboratory test values included thrombocytosis in 4 and slight elevation of GOT and GPT in 1, but they were transient.
