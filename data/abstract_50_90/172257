Two plasmids which confer resistance to Tetracycline-Chloramphenicol and Erythromycine-Clindamycine were found in a strain of Clostridium perfringens. The plasmid (Tet-Chl) was shown to be transferable to sensitive strains of C. perfringens. The transfer experiments were made with the wild type strain or strains cured by one plasmid or the other as donor strains.
