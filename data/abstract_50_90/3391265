The toxicity of the protein synthesis inhibitor puromycin towards a number of human and Chinese hamster cell lines has been examined. In comparison to cells of human origin, Chinese hamster cells exhibited about 25-fold higher resistance towards puromycin. These differences appeared to be species related as all the cell lines from any one species showed similar sensitivity towards puromycin. The incorporation of [3H]leucine in the hamster cell lines was accordingly found to be more resistant to the inhibitory effects of puromycin as compared to human cells. Studies on the cellular uptake of [3H]puromycin showed that in comparison to human cells, the drug uptake/binding in the hamster cell lines was greatly reduced. However, protein synthesis in the extracts of hamster and human cells showed no significant differences in sensitivity towards puromycin. These results show that the observed species related differences in cellular toxicity to puromycin are due to differences in the cellular uptake/binding of the drug.
