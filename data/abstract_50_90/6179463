The effect of dioxidine on the growth of freshly isolated clinical strains of microorganisms with various levels of resistance to antibiotics was studied. It was shown that strains of Ps.aeruginosa not resistant to carbenicillin, chloramphenicol and nalidixic acid were most sensitive to the drug. Similar correlation was found in Proteus strains with various levels of resistance to chloramphenicol. Sensitivity of these organisms to dioxidine did not depend on their resistance to gentamicin, ampicillin and neomycin. The antibacterial effect of the drug is based on inhibition of the synthesis of nucleic acids, the level of DNA synthesis inhibition being the highest. Dioxidine had practically no effect on protein synthesis.
