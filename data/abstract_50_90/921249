Mycobacterium phlei contains two catalase activities and a single peroxidase activity. The latter is associated with one of the catalases. The single catalase-peroxidase enzyme accounted for 75% of the total catalase activity and was lost upon acquisition of resistance to the antitubercular drug isoniazid (INH). Heat-treated (68 degrees C) wild-type cells showed similar decreases in catalase activity as well as complete loss of peroxidase activity. Catalase activity in the INH-resistant strain of M. phlei (Inh(r)) was unaffected by heating. The heat-sensitive catalase of the wild-type M. phlei was completely inhibited by 0.1 M INH, and Cu(2+) enhanced this inhibitory effect by 100-fold. No inhibition of activity was found with the heat-stable enzyme. Equivalent inhibition of catalase was also observed with nicotinic acid hydrazide and benzoic acid hydrazide. Peroxidase activity was also completely inhibited by any one of the three hydrazides, either INH, benzoic acid hydrazide, or nicotinic acid hydrazide at 10(-3) M. The presence of two catalase activities and the loss of one (catalase-peroxidase) on acquiring INH resistance or heating wild-type cells was confirmed by acrylamide gel electrophoresis of the cell-free extracts.
