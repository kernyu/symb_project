We identified four mutations in two previously undescribed loci involved in microtubule function in Aspergillus nidulans as extragenic suppressors of benA33, a heat-sensitive beta-tubulin mutation. Three of the four mutations map to a locus closely linked to riboB on linkage group VIII; we designated this locus mipA (for microtubule-interacting protein). We were not able to map the remaining suppressor because of chromosomal rearrangements. However, since it recombines with riboB at a significantly higher frequency than the mipA alleles, it is unlikely to be in mipA; thus, we designated it mipB1. The mip mutations are not allelic to the previously identified loci that encode alpha- and beta-tubulin, and it is likely that mipA and mipB encode previously unidentified nontubulin proteins involved in microtubule function. Each of the mip mutations suppresses the heat sensitivity conferred by benA33 and suppresses the blockage of nuclear division and movement conferred by this mutation at high temperatures. Interactions between mipA and benA are allele specific. All of the mipA mutations are cryptic in a wild-type benA background but cause cold sensitivity in combination with benA33. These mutations also confer cold sensitivity in combination with benA31 and benA32 and reduce the resistance conferred by these mutations to the antimicrotubule agent benomyl but do not suppress the heat sensitivity conferred by these alleles. Finally, the mipA alleles suppress the heat sensitivity conferred by benA11, benA17, and benA21 but do not confer cold sensitivity in combination with these alleles.
