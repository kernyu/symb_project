Variants resistant to propionate were prepared from a mutant strain of Streptomyces cinnamonensis producing predominantly monensin A. Using selected resistants the production of monensins (in media with higher concentrations of propionate) was examined. Stimulation of monensin synthesis by propionate was observed with 70% of the resistants studied. Propionate did not influence the ratio between monensin A and B production.
