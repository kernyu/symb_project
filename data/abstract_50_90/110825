Insufficient data are available to establish the reliability of direct disk diffusion susceptibility tests performed utilizing positive blood culture broth as inoculum. When Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 were used, 0.03 ml of turbid overnight blood culture broth was found to produce zone diameters closely approximating the size of diameters obtained by a standardized method. Results of direct (0.03 ml of inoculum) and standardized susceptibility tests were then compared for 116 positive blood cultures (1,069 individual disk comparisons). There were 1,011 test agreements (94.6%). There were also 48 (4.5%) minor discrepancies (change between sensitive and intermediate or between intermediate and resistant) and 10 (0.9%) major discrepancies (change between sensitive and resistant). The major discrepancies were randomly distributed among several organisms and antibiotics. Discrepancies occurred most frequently in the more clinically acceptable direction; i.e., in 79.3% the direct test indicted greater resistance than the standardized test. These data establish that 0.03 ml of turbid overnight blood culture broth produces results which compare closely to those obtained with standard methods, and in practice yield direct susceptibility results with a clinically acceptable level of reliability.
