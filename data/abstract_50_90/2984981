A total of 688 isolates of Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli were screened for the presence of plasmid DNA by agarose gel electrophoresis and were tested for susceptibility to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, streptomycin, and tetracycline. Of the isolates examined, 32% were noted to harbor plasmid DNA, ranging in size from 2.0 to 162 kilobases. Only tetracycline resistance was noted to correlate with the presence of plasmids. Plasmids capable of transferring tetracycline resistance via conjugation ranged in size from 42 to 100 kilobases. The Bg/II and Bc/I restriction endonuclease profiles of 31 plasmids examined showed marked diversity in their banding patterns. Although a high degree of DNA-DNA homology was noted among the Campylobacter spp. plasmids, no homology was noted between these plasmids and tetracycline R factors commonly found in the family Enterobacteriaceae.
