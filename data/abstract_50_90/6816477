Auxotyping of 113 gonococcal strains isolated in Bangui (Central African Republic) demonstrated a majority of type "+" and type "PRO-" with an equal repartition between these two types (54 and 56). The study of the sensitivity to 5 antibiotics was realized with 74 strains. It was shown an increasing resistance to penicillins. One strain was a penicillinase producing Neisseria gonorrhoeae (PPNG).
