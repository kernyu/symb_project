A brief review of bacterial arthritis as seen at the Mayo Clinic in the years 1958 through 1973 has been presented with a selected literature review. Once considered a disease of children and adolescents, this disease now is seen more often in adults, especially in those who are elderly, are chronically ill, or are receiving medications that lower the host resistance in invading bacteria. The diagnosis must be made early, with rapid isolation and identification of the organism. Proper antibacterial drugs should be selected on the basis of in vitro susceptibility tests. The joint should be either aspirated or decompressed by closed suction-irrigation. In instances in which diagnosis is late and joint destruction occurs, joint debridement will be necessary.
