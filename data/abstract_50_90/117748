Erythromycin- and clindamycin-resistant Corynebacterium diphtheriae isolates were recovered from skin lesions. Resistance to erythromycin and clindamycin was induced by a subinhibitory concentration (0.03 microgram/ml) of erythromycin. Clindamycin (0.07 microgram/ml) was a more effective inducer of its own resistance than of erythromycin resistance. Erythromycin-inducible cross-resistance to vernamycin B alpha was demonstrated in disk diffusion tests.
