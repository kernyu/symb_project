From 1975-1980, about 130 000 Salmonella strains isolated from various sources were tested for resistance to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, kanamycin, tetracycline and trimethoprim. Following the ban on incorporation of tetracycline in animal feeds for nutritive purposes, tetracycline resistance in S. typhimurium and S. panama strains of porcine origin dropped from about 90% in 1974 for both species, to about 34% and 1%, respectively, 1980. The incidence of resistance in human strains concurrently decreased from about 80% in 1974 to 25% and 1%, respectively, in 1980. The build-up of multiple resistance in bovine S. dublin and S. typhimurium strains, already started in 1973-74, has continued. Recently, phage type 193 S. typhimurium strains have become predominant and they are invariable resistant to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, kanamycin, neomycin, streptomycin, sulphonamide and trimethoprim. Up to now, type 193 strains were hardly encountered in human patients, but the number of human isolates is slowly increasing. A fairly large number of multiply resistant strains belonging to S. oranienburg, S. schwarzengrund, S. typhimurium and, recently, S. krefeld have been isolated from adoptive children from the Far East.
