The turkey-poults on an industrial turkey-breeding farm were studied. A total of 75 strains of Escherichia coli were isolated. Typing was performed by Sojka's method: serotype 0-2 was established in 42.2 percent of the cases, 0-71-- in 12.6 per cent, 0-78 (11.2%), and 0-1 (8.4%). The sensitivity of the typed strains was tested to 8 antibiotics and furazolidon. It was found that all strains possess certain amount of resistance to streptomycin, chloramphenicol, oxitetracycli, and spectam. The same strains proved sensitive to ampicillin, colimycin, tetraoleandomycin, and to a certain extent to kanamycin. It is concluded that prophylaxis and treatment should be carried out with the use of ampicillin, colimycin, furazolidon, and tetraloleandomycin.
