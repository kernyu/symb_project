The in vitro antibacterial activity of HR-756 compared to cefoxitin and cefuroxime. 122 multiresistant clinical isolates including Enterobacteriaceae (104) and P. aeruginosa (18), which present particular problems in antibiotic chemotherapy, were selected for study. HR-756 inhibited all the stains of S. marcescens, P. mirabilis and indole-positive Proteus spp. at a concentration of 1,3 and 12 micrograms/ml, respectively; beta-lactamase-producing strains were also susceptible. 90% of K. pneumoniae and more than half of the Enterobacter and P. aeruginosa were inhibited from the drug at a concentration 16 microgram/ml. Cefoxitin and cefuroxime were less active than HR-756. Cefoxitin was more effective against S. marcescens and P. mirabilis while the same was the case with cefuroxime against K. pneumoniae strains. The greater efficiency of HR-756 over cefoxitin and cefuroxime against these multiply resistant isolates seems to be due not only to its indifference to the beta-lactamases but also to its easier penetrability into the bacterial cell.
