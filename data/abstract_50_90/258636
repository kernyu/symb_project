Of 74 strains of Salmonella isolated by the Laboratory of Microbiology of the Hospital of Novara in 1977 and belonging to 20 different serotypes, transfer of antibiotic-resistance, mostly multiple (Streptomycin, Chloramphenicol, Kanamycin, Tetracycline, Ampicillin) has been detected in 78,5% of 28 antibiotic-resistant strains. As in previous investigations made by the same Laboratory, the highest percentages of transfer of resistance have been observed in some serotypes (S. typhi murium, S. panama), while that was observed only in S. enteritidis isolated in 1977. At last in this period was S. wien able to transmit multiple resistance isolated only once.
