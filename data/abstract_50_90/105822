Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain HL, isolated in Besancon (France), shows a high level of resistance for carbenicillin, as proved in preliminary studies. In this paper, we report the transfer of carbenicillin resistance from Pseudomonas aeruginosa HL1 carrying helper plasmids to other strains of the same species. Comparative study of beta-lactamase activity in the HL1 strain and in the conjugated strains allows confirmation of the transfer of an R-factor from the HL1 strain: in all these strains, the beta-lactamase has the same pI (5.3) and the same Vmax (relative to benzylpenicillin) for ampicillin, carbenicillin and cephaloridin.
