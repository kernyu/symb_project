An extended in vivo test of the sensitivity of Plasmodium falciparum to antimalarial drugs in Nigerian children showed no evidence of resistance to chloroquine and amodiaquine. However, the results of a small number of in vitro tests suggest a decreased sensitivity of the parasite to chloroquine when compared with the results of earlier studies in the same locality.
