A review of the records of 984 patients admitted to hospital from 1970 through 1973 with bacteriologically proven pulmonary tuberculosis showed bacterial resistance to one or more antituberculosis drugs in 103 (10.5%). Among the patients who had had previous drug treatment for tuberculosis the prevalence of drug resistance was 20% in the Canadian-born patients and 69.4% in the recent immigrants. Among the patients who had had no previous drug treatment the prevalence of drug resistance (primary resistance) was 2.7% in Canadian-born patients but 11.4% in recent immigrants. Because of the higher prevalence of drug resistance among recent immigrants and the finding in recent years that increasingly more tuberculosis patients in Ontario are recent immigrants, drug resistance in this group is likely to assume even more importance in the future.
