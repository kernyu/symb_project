Four Vibrio strains have been isolated from three patients presenting diarrhoea as well as from a sea water sample; identification proved their belonging to Vibrio mimicus, a recently described new pathogenic species. The morpho-cultural and biochemical characteristics of the isolated strains are presented. The distribution and incidence of this newly described species in Romania are under study.
