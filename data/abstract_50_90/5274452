New mutant yeasts resistant to the antibiotics chloramphenicol and mikamycin were isolated. They are mitochondrial mutants, characterized by several criteria as cytoplasmically determined. Biochemical studies show that amino acid incorporation into protein in vitro by mitochondria isolated from cells resistant or sensitive to mikamycin or chloramphenicol is inhibited by these antibiotics. Although aerobically-grown resistant strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae are not affected by mikamycin or chloramphenicol, it is found that the mitochondrial protein-synthesizing system of anaerobically grown cells is inhibited in vivo. Cross resistance among the antibiotics chloramphenicol, mikamycin, erythromycin, lincomycin, carbomycin, and spiramycin is reported. All erythromycin resistant mutants, unlike the others, are resistant to erythromycin in vivo and in vitro. The results indicate that some of the cytoplasmic mutations (mikamycin and chloramphenicol resistance) are expressed at the mitochondrial membrane, whereas others (erythromycin resistance) possibly reflect changes in mitochondrial ribosomal proteins. We further suggest that conformational changes, either in the membranes or ribosomes, are likely to account for the observed antibiotic cross resistances.
