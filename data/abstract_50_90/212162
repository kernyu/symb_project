The mechanism underlying the effects of penicillin on slices of the olfactory cortex of the guinea pig was examined. In a previous report it was shown that penicillin increases the amplitude of the presynaptic action potential, the population EPSP and, more strongly, the population responses of the postsynaptic cells. Moreover, the postsynaptic population responses increased in number and suggested strong repetitive firing. These results were confirmed in the present study. Analysis of stimulus-response relationships suggested that the enhancement of the postsynaptic response was due to an increase in excitability of the postsynaptic neurons by penicillin. The amplitude changes of the presynaptic action potential and the EPSP were probably largely, if not completely, due to an increase in resistance of the bathing fluid. It was found that the changes in population responses paralleled to a large extent changes in cell discharge. In addition, penicillin was found to induce spontaneous firing of the postsynaptic cells. The changes in cell discharge were consistent with an increase in excitability of the postsynaptic cells.
