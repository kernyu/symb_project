The present study was undertaken to examine some factors which lead to early-appearing resistance in human cells treated with interferon. It was previously shown that two conditions required for rapid development of resistance were continuous maintenance of cultures at 37 degrees and use of more than 10 units/ml of interferon. The decay kinetics of the established resistance appear to be approximately the same whether the resistance was induced under conditions favoring rapid or slow development. With the use of actinomycin D it was shown that the mRNA for the antiviral protein is produced between 30 and 45 min after the first contact with interferon. Ruled out were the possibilities that a priming action of interferon and a newly synthesized intermediary protein were necessary for rapid development of resistance.
