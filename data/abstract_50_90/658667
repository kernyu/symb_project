Staphylococcal plasmids pS194 and pSC194 which confer streptomycin and streptomycin-chloramphenicol resistance respectively have been used as vectors for construction of recombinant DNA, since they each carry one single recipient site for endonuclease EcoRI. Hybrid DNA does not express streptomycin resistance, a marker which is present in both vectors, presumably because the marker gene is cleaved by EcoRI. A chloramphenicol marker present in pSC194 was used for positive hybrid selection. Hybrid plasmids generated by joining pSC194 with one or more of the four EcoRI fragments of the large (18.1-10(6) daltons) staphylococcal plasmid pI258 were constructed and permitted us to develop a physical map for pI258.
