Routine susceptibilities testing of microorganisms isolated from patients are of restricted usefulness in the treatment of patients because of the delay in obtaining results. Thus, the empiric chemotherapy based on the susceptibility of microorganisms isolated from patients is necessary for the majority of patients with simple and complicated urinary tract infections. In this study the relation between changing susceptibility and background factors such as age, a sex distinction, antibiotics, areas in Japan, simple and complicated UTI and so on, has been investigated.
