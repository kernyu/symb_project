Clindamycin-2-phosphate, a newly developed injectable antibiotic, was bacteriologically evaluated in comparison with the parent compound, clindamycin. Clindamycin-2-phosphate has a rather weak antibacterial activity. However, it is metabolized into clindamycin in vivo. And this parent compound shows strong activity against both gram-positive bacteria and gram-negative cocci. In vitro studies demonstrated that clindamycin-2-phosphate and clindamycin are affected by the pH of the medium used--the antibacterial activity becomes stronger as the medium is made more alkaline--while they are little affected by the size of the inoculum. In mice with experimental infections, clindamycin-2-phosphate showed about the same therapeutical effect as clindamycin in contrast with the former's inferior in vitro activity as compared with the latter.
