A new mutation, nalD, determining resistance of Escherichia coli to nalidixic acid (NAL) is reported. The nalD mutant described is resistant to NAL at 37 degrees C but sensitive at 30 degrees C. It is defective in penetration of NAL and glycerol through the outer membrane at 37 degrees C. The nalD mutation is located half-way between 89 and 89.5 min on the E. coli genetic map.
