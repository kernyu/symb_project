The respiration of subline Leb-25 cells, resistant to ethidium bromide (EB, 25 g/ml), is 2.5 times slower than the respiration of parental L cells of mouse fibroblasts. The EB resistant cells have a normal level of ATP. Disturbances of mitochondrial functions can be observed such as a defect of the succinate dehydrogenase complex and the uncoupling of respiration and oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria of Leb-25 cells.
