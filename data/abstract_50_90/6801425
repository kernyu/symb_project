Mutants of Bacillus subtilis dependent on the antibiotic kasugamycin have been isolated and characterised. The mutant phenotype was the result of a kasugamycin resistance mutation mapping near leu, together with a mutation conferring dependence which mapped elsewhere on the chromosome. In some cases, the latter mutation caused spectinomycin dependence in a spectinomycin resistant strain. Four mutants had detectable alterations in ribosomal proteins, which were not, however, responsible for the phenotype. These alterations were in proteins BS3, BS7, BS9, and BL15. Some mutants had defects in ribosomal subunit assembly, or altered cell morphology associated with the mutant phenotype.
