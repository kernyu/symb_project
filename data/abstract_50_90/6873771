Nystatin-resistant yeast Candida tropicalis was obtained after UV illumination and plating on nystatin-containing media. The mutant contained no ergosterol in the plasma membrane but bound nystatin to a degree similar to that of the wild strain (1.2 vs. 1.5 nmol per mg dry solid). Respiration of the mutant on glucose was reduced by 36% in the presence of 25 microM nystatin. This corresponded to a 25-43% decrease of the uptake of monosaccharides. Transport of amino acids was reduced by nystatin in the mutant by 44-86%, as compared with a 84-95% reduction in the wild strain. The intracellular ATP content was reduced by nystatin equally in the wild strain and in the mutant (by 43 and 47%). Nystatin appears to affect specifically membrane transport processes of nonelectrolytes while both the H+-extruding ATPase and the membrane potential are unaffected.
