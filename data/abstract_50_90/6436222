The emergence and development of chemical and thermal resistance in spores of Bacillus subtilis was examined. The chemicals studied were of the disinfectant type: glutaraldehyde, hypochlorite, hypochlorite-methanol and povidone-iodine. Growth and sporulation were followed by electron microscopy and resistance assigned to specific stages in relation to 45Ca and DPA accumulation. A sequential development of resistance was observed with thermal resistance appearing first at early Stage V corresponding to maturation of cortex and deposition of rudimentary spore coat material. Chemical resistance coincided with middle to late Stage V dependent on the chemical concerned. A progressive development of resistance was observed on prolonged incubation in sporulation medium and was affected by inclusion of lysozyme in the spore washing sequence.
