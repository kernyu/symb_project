The antimicrobial activity of cefoxitin against clinical isolated organisms was measured: Cefoxitin was more active than cefazolin and cephalothin against Escherichia coli. The serum concentrations of cefoxitin following intravenous injection of 25 mg/kg were 267.7, 38.8, 8.3 microgram/ml at 5, 30, 120 minutes after injection, respectively. Cefoxitin was excreted 90.5% in urine within 6 hours after injection. Cefoxitin was administered clinically to 22 pediatric patients with various infections (urinary tract infection 9, respiratory tract infection 10, S.S.S.S. 1, Salmonella enteritis 1, and cervical lymphadenitis 1) at the dose of 45-98 mg/kg/day for 4-10 days, and the following satisfactory results were obtained; excellent in 16, good in 5, and poor in 1. The rate of satisfactory clinical response was 95.5%. Slight elevation of transaminase and A1-P were observed in 4 patients, but no other serious side effects were observed.
