The activity of tiamulin against Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae, M flocculare, M hyorhinis and M hyosynoviae grown in liquid medium was assessed in vitro. With the first three of these mycoplasmas, the activity of tylosin and oxytetracycline was observed in parallel. Tiamulin was more active against M hyopneumoniae and M flocculare, but there was less disparity between the three antibiotics with the strain of M hyorhinis tested. Tiamulin was notably more active against M hyosynoviae than against M hyopneumoniae. It was more difficult to suppress M hyopneumoniae than the other mycoplasmas with tiamulin. This persistence of M hyopneumoniae was more striking when M hyopneumoniae and M hyosynoviae were tested in parallel.
