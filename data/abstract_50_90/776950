Cultures of isocitrate dehydrogenase-deficient (icd) mutants were overgrown by double mutants (icd glt) lacking citrate synthase activity also. The icd mutants grew more slowly than wild-type cells or the double mutants because they accumulated an inhibitory metabolite (possibly citrate). Intracellular citrate levels were several hundred-fold higher in icd cells than in wild-type or icd glt cells. Final growth yields of the wild type and the icd mutant on limiting glucose were equivalent and greater than the growth yield of icd glt double mutants. The icd gene mapped between 60 and 74 min. icd mutants were resistant to nalidixic acid, but glt and icd glt mutants and wild-type cells were sensitive, indicating that resistance results from accumulation of isocitrate, citrate, or a derivative of these compounds.
