Preliminary results suggest that the antibiotic lincomycin (a product of Streptomyces lincolnensis var. lincolnensis) possesses certain valuable properties which include good in vitro activity against many strains of hospital staphylococci resistant to many other antibiotics. During a study of this agent, a selected series of severe staphylococcal infections due to resistant organisms were treated with lincomycin, with encouraging responses. Favourable results were also noted in seven cases of osteomyelitis. Lincomycin may be administered by the oral or parenteral routes to adults and infants and satisfactory serum blood levels obtained. So far as the authors' limited experience enables them to conclude, and at the dose range tested, this antibiotic promises to be one of low toxicity.
