Gentamicin may be used in the treatment of infection with gram-negative bacteria including Pseudomonas spp and Proteus spp. Resistance will only appear in suboptimal or too prolonged courses of treatment and usually is due to 'multi-step mutation'. This resistance may be prevented, among others, by combined treatment with gentamicin and an antibiotic of the beta lactam group. When gentamicin is used correctly, it will have few toxic side-effects. Thus, 3 mg/kg of body weight three times daily will usually be indicated to ensure an optimum therapeutic effect. Parenteral administration of gentamicin would only appear to be useful in cases of bacteraemia and/or bacterial infection of the kidney and/or urinary excretory ducts; in the last-named case, the dose given at one time may be reduced by fifty per cent. Local treatment, the most recent method of which consists in administration by I(ntra-)T(racheal) route, apparently offers more prospects.
