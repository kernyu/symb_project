The authors evaluated the sensitivity of Salmonella rods to augmentin (amoxicilin and clavulanic acid) and 23 antibiotics routinely used in antibiograms. Salmonella strains were isolated in the years 1987-88 from the faeces of children and adults. It was found that 94% of strains were sensitive to augmentin. Among cephalosporins the most effective were cefotaxime and cephtriaxone (100% of sensitive strains) and among aminoglycosides--amikacin (100%) and netilmicin (93%). S. typhimurium revealed greater resistance to antibiotics than S. enteritidis, which points to the need of making antibiograms before starting a therapy of infections induced by S. typhimurium.
