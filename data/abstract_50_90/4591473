The episomic element F'lac(+) was transferred, probably by conjugation, from Escherichia coli to Lac(-) strains of Erwinia herbicola, Erwinia amylovora, and Erwinia chrysanthemi (but not to several other Erwinia spp. In preliminary trials). The lac genes in the exconjugants of the Erwinia spp. showed varying degrees of stability depending on the strain (stable in E. herbicola strains Y46 and Y74 and E. amylovora strain EA178, but markedly unstable in E. chrysanthemi strain EC16). The lac genes and the sex factor (F) were eliminated from the exconjugants by treatment with acridine orange, thus suggesting that both lac and F are not integrated in the Erwinia exconjugants. All of the tested Lac(+) exconjugants of E. herbicola strains Y46 and Y74 and E. amylovora strain EA178, but not of E. chrysanthemi strain EC 16, were sensitive to the F-specific phage M13. The heterogenotes (which harbored F'lac(+)) of E. herbicola strains Y46 and Y74, E. amylovora strain EA178, and E. chrysanthemi strain EC16 were able to transfer lac genes by conjugation to strains of E. herbicola, E. amylovora, E. chrysanthemi, Escherichia coli, and Shigella dysenteriae. The frequency of such transfer from Lac(+) exconjugants of Erwinia spp. was comparable to that achieved by using E. coli F'lac(+) as donors, thus indicating the stability, expression, and restriction-and-modification properties of the sex factor (F) in Erwinia spp.
