In ventriculitis caused by Gentamicin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, Netilmicin was administered intrathecally to 19 patients under continuous control of the Netilmicin concentration in cerebro-spinal fluid (CSF). This therapy was able to bring these otherwise lethal infections under control, usually within 10 days. Pharmacokinetic studies with different doses have shown that doses of 2 X 3 mg are to be recommended in moderately severe cases of ventriculitis, and in most severe infections 3 X 3 mg daily intraventricularly for adults. In infants daily intraventricular injections of 2 X 0.4-0.5 mg Netilmicin are a sufficient dose to produce an effective antibiotic concentration level.
