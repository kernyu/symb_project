Eight mollicellins (depsidones) were assayed for mutagenicity and antibacterial activity in Salmonella/microsome tests involving histidine reversion and forward mutation to 8-azaguanine resistance. Two of them, mollicellins C and E, which contain a 3-methylbutenoic acid moiety, were mutagenic and bactericidal for Salmonella typhimurium in the absence of microsomes. Mollicellins D and F, each containing a chlorine atom, were bactericidal but not mutagenic. The mutagenic activity was completely abolished and the antibiotic activity was greatly reduced by coincubation with rat liver microsomes.
