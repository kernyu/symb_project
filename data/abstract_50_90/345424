The pathogenicity in mice of 7 strains of Candida albicans with different in vitro susceptibility to 5-fluorocytosine (5-FC) was investigated. Resistant strains were not less virulent than susceptible strains. This is contradictory to findings reported for candida strains resistant to polyene antibiotics, which were less pathogenic than susceptible strains. The implications of these findings are discussed.
