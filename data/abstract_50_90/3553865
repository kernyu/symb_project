A study for mercury and antibiotic resistance carried out on 126 clinically significant E. coli isolates from sporadic cases showed that 30.2% (38/126) was Hg2+-resistant. A significantly positive association between mercury and multiple antibiotic resistance was observed although mercury resistance could not be correlated with any single antibiotic tested. In addition, conjugational experiments showed that mercury and antibiotic resistance determinants were not always genetically linked. It is suggested that mercury resistance may be a further marker useful in epidemiologic investigations.
