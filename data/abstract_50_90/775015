Determinants of streptococcin A-FF22 (SA) production and host cell immunity have been transduced to three serologically distinct Group A streptococci. Streptomycin resistance markers were not cotransducible with bacteriocin determinants. SA+ transductants of strains unrelated to the parent SA+ strain were unstable but SA+ transductants of a spontaneous SA- derivative of the parent appeared to be stable.
