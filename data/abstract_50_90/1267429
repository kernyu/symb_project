Phosphonoacetic acid had a significant antiviral effect when applied topically, both in liquid and ointment preparations, on superficial herpetic keratitis in rabbits and was equally as effective as idoxuridine. It was also effective in the treatment of idoxuridine-resistant herpetic keratitis. Phosphonoacetic acid was not effective in the treatment of experimental herpetic iritis when applied topically but was significantly effective when administered intravenously and subconjunctivally. No significant local or systemic toxicity was encountered.
