Sensitivity tests of 5753 organisms (streptococci, Klebsiella, Escherichia coli, enterococci, Pyocyaneus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus group and staphylococci) against sulphonamide, nitrofurantoin, ampicillin, gentamicin, cephalosporin, and chloramphenicol are reported, with special consideration of doxycycline, tetracycline and cotrimoxazole. The samples were broken down in accordance with the respective sources. The particularly high resistance quota of co-trimoxazole was striking. The sensitivity quota against doxycycline exceeds that against tetracycline. There were considerable differences in the resistance patterns of organisms from urine samples as compared to samples from other sources.
