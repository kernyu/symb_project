The results of gonococcal infection treatment at Tokai University Hospital during the past decade were summarized. Symptoms and signs of gonococcal urethritis and their therapeutic responses were essentially the same as in other series previously reported. Among drug regimens employed, penicillins were found most effective while cephalosporins proved to be relatively less effective. One-shot therapy with cephalosporins also proved less satisfactory.
