In a prospective (and continuing) trial, a total of 271 patients with acute purulent exacerbations of chronic respiratory disease (bacteriologically confirmed) were treated with various new oral quinolones including enoxacin (26), pefloxacin (50), ciprofloxacin (80) and ofloxacin (115). Various therapeutic schedules were employed, with differing drug dosages, frequencies of administration and durations of treatment. All patients were investigated microbiologically during and immediately after treatment and after 7 days of follow-up. The best clinical results were noted after ofloxacin 800 mg once daily for 7 days, which showed excellent gastrointestinal absorption and rapid penetration through to the sputum. Some of the treatment failures with enoxacin and pefloxacin could be ascribed to the development of resistance during treatment, rises in minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) being noted with Streptococcus pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
