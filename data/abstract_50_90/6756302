A total of 143 strains of S. typhimurium isolated from clinical cases in Kuwait were investigated for drug resistance. Multidrug resistance (3 or more drugs) was seen in 76.9% of the strains. The common resistance patterns were ASuT (16), AKSuT (20), ASSuT (14), CKSSuT (14), ACKSSuT (10), ACGKSSuT (15) and ACKGSSuTTm (8). MIC of resistant strains was usually high. Sixteen isolates were examined for the transferability of the resistance. All had R-plasmids, both autotransferable and non-autotransferable which could be mobilised by factor X.
