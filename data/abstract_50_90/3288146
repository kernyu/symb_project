Apramycin-modifying strains isolated from pigs with coli bacteriosis, from humans and hospital environment were studied comparatively. Production of enzymes modifying the aminoglycoside was estimated with the radioactive cofactor procedure. E. coli isolates from the animals were phenotypically resistant to apramycin and a number of other aminoglycosides. They produced acetyltransferase AAC(3)IV, phosphotransferase APH(3')(5"), APH(3") and other enzymes. Resistance of the strains to gentamicin was also conditioned by AAC(3)IV since these strains did not produce AAD(2") and AAC(6'). In the resistant strains of E. coli and their transconjugates there were detected plasmids with a relative molecular weight of 60-80 MD. Some of the belonged to the compatibility group I1, the others belonged to the compatibility group H1. Strains of S. marcescens, K. pneumoniae. K. oxytoca and S. aureus isolated from humans and hospital environment were sensitive to apramycin. Only isolates of P. aeruginosa were resistant to this antibiotic. However, all the isolates produced AAC(3)IV. Some of them additionally produced AAC(6'), an enzyme modifying amikacin, kanamycin and other antibiotics and not acetylating apramycin. Almost all the strains produced kanamycin- and streptomycin phosphotransferases. Possible coselection of strains resistant to apramycin and gentamicin using one of these aminoglycosides is discussed.
