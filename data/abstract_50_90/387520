The ability of 13 Erwinia strains to accept, to inherit and to transmit the Rts1 factor by conjugation was studied. 11 strains accepted the Rts1 factor from Escherichia coli K-12 CSH-2 with the frequency of about 10(-7)--10(-3). The Rts1 factor was genetically stable in the Erwinia cells and was not eliminated by acriflavine and under the temperature of 37 and 42 degrees C. All the R+ exconjugants were characterized with more high degree of the resistance of kanamycin than E. coli cells harbouring the same R factor. Erwinia strains harbouring the Rts1 plasmid transferred it by conjugation into homologic (Erwinia) and heterologic (E. coli) bacteria. The study of kinetics of the transfer of the Rts1 factor in different mating systems showed that the transfer of this plasmid from R+ Erwinia into R- Erwinia and R- E. coli--in the liquid medium. It is concluded that Erwinia can be the host and the donor of the Rts1 factor.
