This paper describes the analysis of cold-resistant revertants of a cold-sensitive mutant. Pm1-1 is a ribosomal mutation screened for its paromomycin resistance. Suppression of its cold sensitivity occurs with two kinds of external mutations localized in two different loci. One of them, PmB, is assumed to be a ribosomal gene. PmB mutations confer hypersensitivity to paromomycin in vivo as well as in vitro in a cell-free protein synthesis system.
