Seventy two Candida strains isolated from patients with candidiosis of the oral mucosa were studied with respect to their sensitivity to nystatin, levorin, decamine, ethonium, sanguiritrin and clotrimazole. At concentrations of 0.5 to 5 micrograms/ml all the Candida species i.e. C. albicans, C. tropicalis, C. krusei and C. quilliermondii were highly sensitive to clotrimazole. Fungistatic action of levorin, nystatin and sanguiritrin was observed in 91, 67 and 38 per cent of the strains respectively. The Candida strains were resistant to decamine and ethonium used in the above concentrations.
