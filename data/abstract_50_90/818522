Biological side effects, which are particularly characterized by a change of bacterial flora, appear during chemotherapy, and are dependent on the mode of action of the different substances. While shifts in the germ count of skin flora have no great importance, gram-negative bacilli, especially enterobacteriaceae, multiply in the flora of the nose and throat, particularly after administration of beta-lactam antibiotics. These changes usually revert to normal in a short time after the antibiotic has been discontinued. Considerably more important are the changes in the flora of the large intestine, sensitive species being eliminated and resistant strains, usually R factor carriers, become selected. These organisms then play an important part in hospital cross-infection. This state of affairs can only be controlled by specific selection of chemotherapeutic agents and strict observance of all disinfectant measures.
