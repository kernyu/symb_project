Cultures of S. aureus in 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer heated at 52 C for 15 min lost their tolerance to 7.5% NaCl. After incubation in a complex growth medium or in a diluted dialyzed medium in which unheated cells were unable to grow, salt tolerance was regained. Heat injury caused 30% loss of lipid. During recovery, the concentration of C(15) and C(17) fatty acids returned to normal, and there appeared to be an oversynthesis of C(16) and C(18) unsaturated acids. Penicillin abolished the latter reaction without affecting recovery; chloramphenicol did not affect fatty acid oversynthesis but reduced recovery. The K/Na ratio was 12.6 in control cells and 3.4 in injured cells, where it remained during the recovery of salt tolerance. Aspartate uptake was about 10% of the control level after injury and about 35% at recovery. Control cells grew without a lag on subculture, but injured cells which had regained their salt tolerance needed about 2 more h of incubation. Cells recovering with penicillin needed 6 more h, and cells recovering with chloramphenicol did not grow without a prolonged lag. Cells of S. aureus, therefore, may recover their salt tolerance while various membrane functions are still damaged.
