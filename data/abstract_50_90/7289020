Laboratory and clinical studies were performed on a newly introduced antibiotic of the cephamycin series, cefoxitin (CFX), and the results obtained were as follows: 1. Employing clinical isolates, MICs were determined and comparisons made with those of cephalosporins. The MICs of CFX against S. aureus and S. pyogenes slightly inferior to those of the cephalosporins, while the MICs of CFX against Gram-negative bacilli such as E. coli, Proteus sp. and Klebsiella sp. were considerably superior to those of CER and CET, and slightly superior to those of CEZ. 2. The peak serum concentrations were 34.7 mcg/ml and 67.6 mcg/ml at 30 minutes after an intravenous injection in doses of 12.5 mg/kg and 25 mg/kg, respectively. The peak serum concentration was 40.8 mcg/ml at the end of 60 minutes intravenous drip infusion when it was given in a dose of 25 mg/kg. In these cases, the serum half life were 25.8-51.2 minutes, and their urinary recovery were 67-90%. 3. Clinically, CFX was given to the 29 children with a total of 31 of varying bacterial infections: 6 cases of urinary tract infection (U.T.I.), 19 of respiratory tract infection (R.T.I.), 2 of staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome (S.S.S.S.), 2 of purulent lymphadenitis and 2 cases of soft tissue dermatological infections. Overall efficacy rate was 83.9% (26 cases). No significant adverse reaction was noted except for 1 case of rash. Abnormal laboratory findings observed were elevation of GOT and GPT in 1 patient and of GPT in 1 patient.
