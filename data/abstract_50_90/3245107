A mixed population of Haemonchus contortus, Teladorsagia circumcincta and Trichostrongylus colubriformis was passed for four generations through lambs. In successive passages and on Day 6 (D6), lambs were dosed subcutaneously with ivermectin at 100, 200, 250 and 225 micrograms kg-1 body weight, respectively. No larvae of H. contortus were recovered after the first passage and following the third drug exposure only T. colubriformis was present. Larvae of the selected strain of T. colubriformis developed to third stage, sheathed larvae in vitro in concentrations of ivermectin that inhibited development of larvae from the original strain of T. colubriformis. A definitive control test was then run with 45 lambs, to compare this selected strain to the original strain. The treatments were 150 micrograms kg-1 subcutaneous (SC) D6, 200 micrograms kg-1 SC D6, 200 micrograms kg-1 intraruminal (IR) D6 and 200 micrograms kg-1 SC D21; all treatments were compared to non-treated controls, selected or original strain as applicable. The D6 IR and D6 SC 150 micrograms kg-1 treatments were greater than 99% effective in both strains, although the D6 SC 200 micrograms kg-1 treatment was 85 and 48% effective in the original and selected strain, respectively. The D21 200 micrograms kg-1 was only 58% effective against the selected strain. There was significant (P less than 0.001) differences between the original and selected strains of T. colubriformis for both fecal egg output and worm counts. The exposure of four generations of immature T. colubriformis to ivermectin selected for partial resistance.
