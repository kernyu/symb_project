The effect of inhibition of protein synthesis on the replication of the R factor Rts1 in Proteus mirabilis was examined by using the technique of CsCl density gradient centrifugation. Only 12% of the copies of Rts1 were found to replicate during amino acid starvation, whereas there was a 30% increase in the amount of P. mirabilis chromosomal deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) during the same period. Essentially the same amount of Rts1 and host chromosome replication was observed when chloramphenicol was used to inhibit protein synthesis. The replication of Rts1 DNA was also examined in experiments in which cultures were starved for amino acids in (14)N-labeled medium and then transferred to (15)N-labeled medium containing the required amino acids. These experiments showed that Rts1 replication took place throughout the first generation in (15)N-labeled medium and that each copy of Rts1 was replicated one time during the first generation of chromosomal DNA synthesis in (15)N-medium.
