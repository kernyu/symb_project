Carumonam, a new monobactam, was found to have an anti-microbial spectrum similar to aztreonam. Its spectrum includes Enterobacteriaceae, Haemophilus influenzae, pathogenic Neisseria species, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and some streptococci. Staphylococcus species, enterococci, and many other nonenteric gram-negative bacilli were not inhibited. Enterobacteriaceae resistant to cefoperazone (minimum inhibitory concentrations [MICs] greater than or equal to 32 mg/L) were more likely inhibited by carumonam (52% at less than or equal to 8.0 mg/L) than aztreonam (39%) or ceftazidime (35%). Dilution test methods on agar or in Mueller-Hinton broth produced similar results. Carumonam minimum bactericidal concentrations were usually the same or one dilution above the MIC. Carumonam and aztreonam were very stable to most chromosomal (P99, K1, K14) and plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases (TEM, OXA, PSE). The Klebsiella oxytoca enzymes hydrolyzed aztreonam at rates greater than or equal to fivefold higher than carumonam but at a rate less than 1% that of cephaloridine. The aztreonam MICs for these Klebsiella stains were greater than or equal to 32 mg/L, but the hydrolysis rates do not fully explain the high-grade resistance to aztreonam. In vitro susceptibility tests with 30-micrograms carumonam disks were found to be very predictive. Similar regression statistics were observed for aztreonam and cefotaxime. Recommendations for carumonam susceptibility testing are susceptible greater than or equal to 21 mm (less than or equal to 8.0 mg/L) and resistant less than or equal to 14 mm (greater than or equal to 32 mg/L). Cross-resistance analysis favors the independent testing of carumonam or aztreonam against gram-negative species other than Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa.
