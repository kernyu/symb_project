This appears to be the first report of the isolation of a penicillinase-producing strain of Neisseria gonorrhoeae in the Netherlands. The presence of a penicillinase-producing gonococcal strain (PPGS) was demonstrated in two of a group of three patients with gonorrhoea. In addition, a penicillin- and ampicillin-sensitive gonococcus strain was isolated from all three patients. The PPGS was most probably imported into Holland from the Philippines. The epidemiological and clinical findings and the results of treatment of infection with this PPGS are discussed.
