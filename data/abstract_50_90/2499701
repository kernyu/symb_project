Methicillin resistant Staph Aureus (MRSA) were studied in a 300 bedded Central Government Hospital Rawalpindi, in which 291 staff members were screened by nasal swabbing. Of 125 cases carrying staph aureus 5 (1.78%) were methicillin resistant. They were treated with Bacitracin ointment to be applied to interior nares four times a day for one week. Hexachlorophane baths daily, chlorhexidine shampoo once daily for a week, and were taken off duty from wards for one day.
