The group JK diphtheroid organism is a multiply resistant opportunistic pathogen which infects immunocompromised patients sporadically. We describe the first reported outbreak of JK diphtheroid infections, in which four cases of bacteremia and one Hickman catheter site infection occurred during 4 weeks on a hematology ward. On this ward, JK diphtheroid was recovered from 17 of 39 patients, 10 of 17 30-ft3 (0.840-m3) air samples, surfaces in 9 of 13 patient rooms, and hands of 4 of 22 personnel. Previously identified risk factors for JK diphtheroid sepsis (male gender, broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy, granulocytopenia, and prolonged hospital stay) were present in infected patients but did not distinguish them from patients who were only colonized. Emphasis on aseptic practices was associated with termination of the outbreak and negative hand cultures from personnel, despite continued patient colonization and environmental contamination.
