Specific transduction of inducible (eroA) and constitutive (eroB) erythromycin resistance is mediated by thymineless induced lysates from derivatives of Staphylococcus aureus strain 8325(N)thy. Both loci can coexist in the same cell but segregate by transduction or transformation. The gene(s) is probably integrated in the recipient chromosome and excised at thymine starvation.
