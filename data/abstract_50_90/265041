Described is a case of chronic staphylococcal stomatitis, apparently precipitated by toothbrushing, which persisted for almost 6 months. The implicated organism, Staphylococcus aureus, was resistant to penicillin and tetracycline but sensitive to erythromycin. Recovery finally occurred after antibiotic therapy combined with surgical excision of some small persistent ulcers. Ther sera from a paired set of blood specimens failed to show a significant agglutinating titer, but the samples of saliva collected at the same times gave evidence of specific secretory Iga and showed relatively high agglutinating titer.
