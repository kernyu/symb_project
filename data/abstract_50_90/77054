A horse with foot-mange failed to recover following a number of courses of treatment with coumaphos. Mites isolated from this horse were tested in vitro for their sensitivity to coumaphos and lindane. The mites were resistant to coumaphos and sensitive to lindane. Following treatment with lindane, the horse recovered within four weeks.
