This work describes isolation and characterization of Streptomyces clavuligerus mutants resistant to the lysine analogue S-(2-aminoethyl)-L-cysteine (AEC). The mutation to AEC resistance was shown to affect the feedback regulation of aspartokinase; 70% of the mutants isolated had aspartokinase activity insensitive to concerted feedback inhibition by lysine plus threonine. Among these mutants, 70% (about 50% of the total AEC-resistant strains isolated) showed significant overproduction of beta-lactam antibiotics.
