Folliculitis decalvans is a rare follicular inflammatory disease of the scalp. It is characterized by initial perifollicular inflammatory changes followed by peripheral extension and eventual circumscribed patches of cicatricial alopecia. The disease is known for its resistance to treatment, resulting in an unfavorable prognosis. The cause of the disease is unknown, although a bacterial etiology is postulated. We report a classic case that was temporized with various antibiotics and only subsequently resolved after ten weeks of therapy with rifampin. The patient has remained free of disease for more than one year. We present a brief review of the cicatricial alopecias and discuss rifampin therapy for this condition.
