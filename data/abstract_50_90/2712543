The in vitro activity of temafloxacin (A-62254), a new quinolone antibiotic, against 13 strains of Chlamydia trachomatis was determined and compared with those of doxycycline, norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and difloxacin. Temafloxacin and difloxacin were the most active quinolones tested, with bactericidal activity comparable to that of doxycycline.
