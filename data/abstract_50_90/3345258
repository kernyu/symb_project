The in vitro susceptibility to cephalothin and cefuroxime of 195 isolates of methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci was determined by the agar-diffusion test, using 7.5% NaCl-supplemented agar. The distribution of the inhibition zone diameters for isolates of S. epidermidis (S. biotype 1) as well as for S. haemolyticus (S. biotype 4) was trimodal. While 4% of the isolates were found susceptible to cefuroxime, 39% of the S. epidermidis/S. hominis (S. biotype 1) isolates and 34% of the S. haemolyticus (S. biotype 4) isolates were found susceptible to cephalothin by this method. Eight of these isolates (six S. epidermidis, two S. haemolyticus) were selected for susceptibility testing by the tube-dilution method, together with four isolates (three S. haemolyticus, one S. epidermidis) found resistant to cephalothin by the agar-diffusion test. The first-mentioned isolates were all found susceptible to cephalothin with MICs less than or equal to 2 micrograms/l, while the last-named all were resistant with MICs greater than or equal to 16 micrograms/ml. Population analyses revealed sub-populations of highly resistant bacteria in all methicillin-resistant isolates of S. epidermidis (S. biotype 1), as well as in all isolates of S. haemolyticus (S. biotype 4). We thus concluded that methicillin-resistance in isolates of coagulase-negative staphylococci implies resistance to cephalosporins and that the difference between S. epidermidis and S. haemolyticus as regards cephalosporin-susceptibility is quantitative and not qualitative. Eighty-nine per cent of the 195 methicillin-resistant isolates in this study were resistant to penicillin and at least one more antibiotic. We therefore think that resistance to penicillin and one or more non-beta-lactam antibiotics strongly suggests methicillin-resistance and that such isolates should be further tested on hypertonic media.
