The case of a 38-year-old male patient with chronic recurrent oropharyngo-esophageal candidiasis since early childhood, resistant to topical therapy with nystatin, is reported. The disease had resulted in impressive oropharyngeal lesions and stricturing of the midesophagus. Extensive in vivo and in vitro immunological studies done before and after successful treatment with miconazole showed a persistent partial deficiency of the cell-mediated immune system, in particular that directed toward candida antigens. Miconazole, a new potent antifungal drug, proved effective in controlling the candidiasis, which had become resistant to conventional treatment.
