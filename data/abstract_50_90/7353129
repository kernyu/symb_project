A total of 1388 urinary bacterial pathogens were tested for resistance to plain trimethoprim after five years' use of this drug for prophylaxis against urinary tract infections. Samples were obtained in Turku, Finland, where use of the drug is much greater than in other parts of Finland. Resistance to trimethoprim (greater than 8 mg/l; agar-dilution method) occurred in 20.3% of strains isolated from outpatients and 39.8% of strains isolated from inpatients. Escherichia coli and Micrococcus showed low incidences of resistance (11% and 13% respectively in ouptatients and 23% and 19% respectively in inpatients); Enterobacter, Streptococcus faecalis, and Staphylococcus epidermidis occupied an intermediate position; and Proteus mirabilis and Klebsiella were resistant in 41-76% of cases. Similar incidences of resistance were observed to sulphamethoxazole-trimethoprim, sulphamethoxazole, ampicillin, and nitrofurantoin. These findings together with the rare occurrence of side effects and convenient dosage confirm the usefulness of plain trimethoprim for urinary tract infection.
