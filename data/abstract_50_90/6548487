A marked, stable mutant of Propionibacterium shermanii T-73, polyresistant to antibiotics, displaying a broad spectrum of antagonistic effect and enhancing synthesis of vitamins B1, B2, B12 and C was obtained. On the basis of the selected mutant, a sour milk product (propioni-acidophilic milk) was prepared and used with good results in complex therapy of intestinal dysbacteriosis in 1148 children aged 4 to 18 months. The administration of propioni-acidophilic milk for a period of 5-12 days led to restoration of the impaired composition of normal microflora and to reconstitution of quantitative relations between the representatives of microbiocoenosis in the distal portions of the large intestine, thus shortening the time of convalescence and rehabilitation of children suffering from acute and chronic inflammatory diseases of the gastrointestinal tract with symptoms of dysbacteriosis.
