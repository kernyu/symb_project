The effect of cyclosporine A (Cs A) and its analog B-5-49 on Leishmania major in vitro and in vivo in the highly susceptible BALB/c mouse strain has been investigated. In vitro, both of these drugs showed significant toxicity toward L. major, but only at relatively high levels (greater than 25 micrograms/ml). However, at 5 and 10 micrograms/ml, levels which correspond more closely to physiologically achievable concentrations, no growth-inhibitory effect in vitro was observed. On administration of the drugs to animals with established lesions, no beneficial effect was observed and, in fact, some exacerbation of lesion development and disease progression was noted. Surprisingly, a majority of the mice treated prophylactically with Cs A for a period of 7 consecutive days beginning 1 day before infection with L. major did not develop ulcerated cutaneous lesions, although some footpad swelling was observed 10 days to 2 wk after infection. These resistant animals displayed a sustained DTH after infection, and were resistant to further challenge with virulent L. major. Prophylactic treatment with the B-5-49 analog of Cs A was also effective in enhancing resistance to L. major infection in BALB/c mice, although to a somewhat lesser degree. Because the cyclosporines tested do not appear to be directly toxic nor inhibitory in vivo for established L. major infections, it appears that these drugs may be effective in modulating the induction stage of the immune response toward the parasites in the BALB/c mouse in such a way as to allow a protective immunity to develop.
