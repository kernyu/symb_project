A total of 207 strains of Bordetella bronchiseptica isolated from pigs in 1978 and 1979 were tested for drug resistance and for the properties of their R plasmids. Apart from intrinsic resistance to spectinomycin, single (sulfadimethoxine), double (sulfadimethoxine and streptomycin), andt riple (sulfadimethoxine, streptomycin, and ampicillin) resistance were found in 54.1%, 1.0%, and 15.9% of the strains, respectively. All of the triple-resistance determinants were associated with mercury resistance and were conjugative. pBB1, one of these R plasmids, was identified as Fi- (F) and Spp- (no suppression of phage multiplication) type, and as a member of incompatability group IncP. The single- and double-resistance determinants were nonconjugative. pBB2, one of the double-resistance determinants, was mobilized by an R plasmid, RP4, with the high efficiency of 80% and at a frequency of 3.3% without cotransfer of RP4. The molecular weight of pBB1 and pBB2 was estimated at 36 X 10(6) and 13 X 10(6) daltons, respectively, by electron microscopy and agarose gel electrophoresis. pBB1 had five cleavage sites for EcoRI endonuclease, and four sites for HindIII. pBB2 had two EcoRI sites, one HindIII, and one BamHI site. Cells carrying pBB1 or pBB2 produced enzymic activity tha inactivated streptomycin in the presence of ATP.
