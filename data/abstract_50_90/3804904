Twenty-one patients with cellulitis or other bacterial soft-tissue infections were treated with oral ciprofloxacin. One patient developed nausea and vomiting and was withdrawn from the study, but 19 of the other 20 were clinically cured or improved. Only nine of the original 18 bacterial isolates were completely eradicated, however, the majority of the failures being staphylococci or streptococci. There was no evidence from disc sensitivity testing of resistance developing during treatment. No serious toxicity was seen.
