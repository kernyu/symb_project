Twenty-five courses of oral ciprofloxacin were administered to 16 patients experiencing pulmonary exacerbations of cystic fibrosis in an open, uncontrolled trial of efficacy and tolerance. Patients were treated for 7-35 days and efficacy was evaluated based on changes in clinical score, white blood cell count, quantitative bacteriology of sputum, and pulmonary function tests. Most courses of therapy were associated with a positive response with changes in clinical score and forced expiratory volume in one second being statistically significant (p less than 0.05). No side effects to ciprofloxacin were noted. Emergence of bacterial resistance to ciprofloxacin was rare. Ciprofloxacin appears to be effective in patients with cystic fibrosis who are experiencing pulmonary exacerbations associated with susceptible bacterial pathogens.
