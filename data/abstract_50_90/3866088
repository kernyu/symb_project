A clinical trial of ceftizoxime suppositories (CZX-S) was performed to evaluate the therapeutic effectiveness in children with bacterial infection. The subjects were 10 children comprising 4 with pneumonia, 3 with lacunar tonsillitis, 2 with pharyngitis, and 1 with UTI. They were given 1 suppository containing either 125 mg or 250 mg of CZX 2 to 4 times a day. The daily per kg body weight dose ranged from 17.1 to 60.0 mg. The result was "markedly effective" in 3, "effective" in 6, and "failure" was recorded in 1. Bacteriologically, successful eradication of causative organisms was confirmed in all the 4 children who underwent the test. No clinical side effects were observed. The only laboratory test abnormality recorded in a single patient was eosinophilia, which was not definitely ascribable to CZX-S. In conclusion, CZX-S have proved to be a clinically safe and effective antibiotic preparation in infantile infection, even in children whose treatment with conventional antibiotics is associated with difficulties.
