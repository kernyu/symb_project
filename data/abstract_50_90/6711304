Ninety-seven strains of clinically isolated Corynebacterium strains, probably identical with Corynebacterium JK, are described especially in regard to growth in relation to different lipid substances. The corynebacteria formed a homogeneous group of strict aerobic slow-growing, catalase-positive, urease-and-nitrate-negative typical coryneform rods. Acid was produced from glucose and maltose. Growth was stimulated in the presence of different lipid substances and lipodependence was suggested by satellite growth only around oleic acid drops on otherwise lipid-depleted agar plates. Generally the isolated corynebacteria were resistant to clinically achievable concentrations of penicillins, cephalosporines and aminoglucosides but uniformly sensitive to vancomycin and rifamycin.
