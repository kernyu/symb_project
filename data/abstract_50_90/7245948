Pathogens and their antibiogram of 79 patients suffering from osteomyelitis were examined. Monoinfection was present in a percentage of 66. The still dominant role of Staph. aureus could be confirmed, but also the increasing number of gram-negative bacteria. The mixed infection is obviously determined by gram-negative germs with their marked resistance to antibiotics. Ps. aeruginosa was isolated as the most frequent gram-negative pathogen. On an average Gentamycin was effective in a percentage of 95. Systemic and also topic application of antibiotics should be subjected to strict rules.
