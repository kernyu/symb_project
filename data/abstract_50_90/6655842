Fundamental and clinical studies on cefpiramide (CPM), a new semisynthetic cephalosporin were performed and the following results were obtained. Antibacterial activity The antibacterial activity of CPM was investigated in comparison with those of CTT, CPZ, CEZ, LMOX and CFS. Against clinical isolates of S. aureus, CPM was superior to CTT and LMOX, but almost similar to CPZ and inferior to CEZ. Against E. coli, K. pneumoniae, P. mirabilis and S. marcescens, CPM showed the activity almost similar to that of CEZ, but inferior to those of the others. On the contrary, the activity of CPM against P. aeruginosa was satisfactory and was superior to those of CTT, CPZ and LMOX, but slightly inferior to that of CFS. Blood level and urinary recovery Twenty mg/kg of CPM was given intravenously at one shot to 3 patients. The mean serum levels of CPM were 116.9 micrograms/ml at 30 minutes, 90.5 micrograms/ml at 1 hour, 71.1 micrograms/ml at 2 hours, 55.8 micrograms/ml at 4 hours, 24.9 micrograms/ml at 6 hours, 19.3 micrograms/ml at 9 hours and 12.1 micrograms/ml at 12 hours after administration, respectively. The mean half-life was very long and the value was 3.85 hours. The urinary recovery rates in 2 cases were 18.31 and 21.47% respectively up to 12 hours after administration. Clinical results and side effects CPM was given intravenously to 30 diseases including 11 cases of bronchopneumonia, 3 cases of bronchopneumonia and pleurisy, 2 cases of bronchitis, 4 cases of purulent tonsillitis, 5 cases of pyelonephritis and each one case of pyothorax, parotitis, cellulitis, otitis media and salmonellosis. CPM was effective in 29 out of 30 cases, and the effective rate was 96.7%. As side effects, 2 cases of fever and 1 case of cough were observed, but no abnormality in clinical laboratory findings was observed.
