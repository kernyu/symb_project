This study leads to the conclusion that gentamicin plus cephalothin or oxacillin is as bactericidal as vancomycin for oxacillin-resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus in vitro. This finding suggests that these regimes might prove valuable in the therapy of infections caused by oxacillin-resistant staphylococci.
