A series of studies on cefuroxime (CXM) were carried out and the following results were obtained. 1) Most of MICs to recent clinical isolates of Group A hemolytic Streptococcus were less than 0.0125 micrograms/ml. 2) A single intravenous bolus dose of 36.5 mg/kg of CXM was given to two children, and the peak blood levels of 30 and 40 micrograms/ml were obtained at 30 minutres after injection; mean half-life in blood was 1.02 hours. The doses of 25 approximately 50 mg/kg were given over 1 hour by intravenous instillation to six children. The peak blood level appeared at the end of instillation, and half-life in blood was distributed between 0.56 and 0.81 hour. With both of these administrations, measurable blood levels were maintained up to 6 hours, and urinary excretion rate in active form up to 6 hours was distributed between 40.5 and 96%. 3) Serious upper respiratory tract inflammations, low respiratory tract inflammations (acute bronchitis and bronchopneumonia), staphylococcal exanthema and acute urinary tract infections mostly responded well to CXM intravenous administration (one shot injection, or instillation at dose of 50 approximately mg/kg/day in 2 approximately 3 daily divided doses. 4) Staphylococcal pyothorax was completely cured by 17 day-long CXM intravenous instillation at dose of about 150 mg/kg/day. 5) No difference in CXM therapy result was seen between the two administration forms used, i.e., one shot injection and instillation. 6) Clinical efficacy rate in 48 patients was 100% (excluding 1 unassessable case). As for side effect, transitory elevation of GPT and Al-P were seen in only 1 case each. The summary of this paper was reported on June 9, 1979 at 27th General Meeting of Japan Society of Chemotherapy (Fukuoka).
