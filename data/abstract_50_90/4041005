Heavy sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) was prepared from skeletal muscle of chronic alcoholic rats and control rats. Compared with control rat SR, the SR prepared from alcoholic rats is leakier to Ca2+ and has a lower level of maximum storable Ca2+. With in vitro exposure to ethanol, the Ca2+ release of alcoholic rat SR was not enhanced as much as that of SR prepared from control rats. By using the spin-probes 5-, 7-, 12-, and 16-doxylstearic acid, the disordering effect of ethanol on the SR membrane was studied. The results suggest that SR membrane of chronic alcoholic rats is less ordered than that of control rats even in the absence of in vitro ethanol. However, chronic SR membrane shows a greater resistance to the disordering effect of in vitro addition of ethanol than control rat SR.
