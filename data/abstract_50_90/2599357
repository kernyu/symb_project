Streptomyces lividans normally accumulated high levels of ppGpp during nutritional shift-down. Its accumulation was, however, severely inhibited when a small amount of thiopeptin (an analogue of thiostrepton) was included in the transfer medium. In contrast, a S. lividans strain, which harbours the plasmid pIJ702 carrying the tsr gene resist to thiopeptin through methylation of the 23S rRNA, was still capable of accumulating ppGpp in the presence of large amounts of thiopeptin. These results indicate that the rRNA methylation resulting from the action of tsr gene prevents thiopeptin not only from inhibiting cell-growth but also from inhibiting ppGpp synthesis. The results also indicate that the observed accumulation of ppGpp during nutritional shift-down was associated with ribosomal function, as has been shown in E. coli and B. subtilis.
