Two multiresistant Klebsiella pneumoniae strains isolated from cerebrospinal fluid of human neonates were analyzed for their plasmid content. Two of the plasmids harbored by these strains, pJHCMW1 (11 kilobase pairs) and pJHCMW4 (75 kilobase pairs), carried genetic determinants for amikacin resistance. These plasmids also encoded resistance to kanamycin, tobramycin, and ampicillin which could be transferred to Escherichia coli by conjugation. Extracts from transconjugant derivatives carrying pJHCMW4 produced an acetyltransferase activity that acetylated all three aminoglycosides. Transconjugant derivatives carrying pJHCMW1 encoded both acetylating and phosphorylating activities. Southern blot hybridization analysis indicated considerable DNA homology between these two plasmids.
