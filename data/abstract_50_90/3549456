We have constructed a shuttle vector that replicates in Escherichia coli, Corynebacterium glutamicum and Brevibacterium lactofermentum, by fusion of a 4.4-kb cryptic plasmid isolated from B. lactofermentum and a derivative of pBR322. Resistance to erythromycin which is expressed in all three bacteria has been a useful selective marker. The frequency of homospecific transformation was 1.5 X 10(5) transformants/micrograms of hybrid plasmid DNA.
