The in-vitro antifungal activities of BAY N 7133, a new orally absorbed synthetic azole derivative against 364 strains of fungal pathogens were studied in direct comparison with another orally active azole compound ketoconazole, using an agar dilution procedure. BAY N 7133 was found to have a broad spectrum of antifungal activity and to inhibit most pathogenic yeasts and fungi at concentrations ranging from less than or equal to 0.04 to 10 mg/1, with the exception only of some strains of zygomycetic pathogens. It was equal to or even greater than ketoconazole in activity against most of the fungal pathogens tested. Composition and pH of culture media and inoculum size altered the effect of BAY N 7133. No in-vitro development of drug resistance was demonstrated. BAY N 7133 can be considered to have a possible usefulness in the treatment of human mycoses.
