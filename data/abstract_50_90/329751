Antibiotic sensitivity of 486 strains of grampositive and gramnegative organisms isolated from patients with purulent infections was studied in vitro. Gentamicin was shown to be highly active as compared to kanamycin and other antibiotics against the main causative agents of purulent inflammatory infections including multiresistant E. coli, Proteus, Ps. aeruginosa, Staphylococcus. High efficiency of gentamicin in therapy of peritonitis, septic conditions, purulent postoperative wounds, infections of the urinary tract, pneumonia, etc. (197 patients) was shown. Positive results were obtained in 87.4 per cent of the cases. Side effects, such as albuminuria, hyperthermic reaction, rash, pruritus were registered in 3 per cent of the patients.
