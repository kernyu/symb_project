Streptomycin-resistant mutations in donor strains of E. coli K12 Hfr AB 313 and AT-13 are not associated with the action of the strA-gene limiting the suppression. Shigella mutations str-r obtained by the method described in this paper also failed to limit the suppression. Changes in the virulence observed in transmission strA region from the str-r strains of E. coli and shigellae used in this work were not connected with mutations limiting the suppression (with competent mutations).
