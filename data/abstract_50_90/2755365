Twenty strains of Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) isolated from swine and five strains from humans were examined for drug susceptibility and plasmid content. Four strains of swine origin and two strains of human origin harbored plasmid DNAs differing in molecular weights. No relationship between plasmid contents and drug resistance was observed. Southern DNA-DNA hybridization showed that small plasmids from swine MAC strains were homologous to those from human origin at the nucleotide level.
