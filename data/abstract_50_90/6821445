In an experimental model of Pseudomonas keratitis caused by a gentamicin-resistant strain of Ps aeruginosa, the results of treatment with gentamicin alone and a gentamicin-steroid combination were evaluated. Treatment with steroids did not reduce the amount of corneal inflammation when compared to eyes treated with gentamicin alone. Eyes treated with the gentamicin-steroid combination were, however, infected with a statistically significant greater number of organisms at the end of a 3-day treatment period. Corticosteroids probably should not be used in the treatment of Pseudomonas keratitis during the early period when the antibiotic sensitivities of the organism are not known.
