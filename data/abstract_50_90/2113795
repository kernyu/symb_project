Bacitracin induced one protein (bacitracin-induced protein [BIP]) in Bacillus thuringiensis and two proteins (BIP1 and BIP2) in Bacillus subtilis that were localized in the membrane. Divalent cations acted as cofactors for induction in all three cases. Growth was initially inhibited by the antibiotic, but following induction of proteins growth resumed. B. subtilis cells possessing BIPs were able to duplicate at a normal rate in the presence of bacitracin. The amount of B. subtilis BIPs diminished markedly after a few divisions in the absence of the antibiotic and the organism simultaneously reverted to the susceptible state. Induction of the proteins did not take place after the fourth or fifth hour of the stationary phase. The B. thuringiensis BIP was also induced by vancomycin. Bacitracin did not induce the synthesis of specific proteins in susceptible (Micrococcus lysodeikticus) or outer membrane-possessing resistant bacteria (Escherichia coli).
