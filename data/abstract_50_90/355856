In vitro recombination techniques were used to construct hybrid plasmids between pBR 322 and different DNA fragments derived from pML 21 and the E. coli chromosome. Some of the resulting hybrid plasmids express the tetracycline resistance gene of pBR 322, depending on the DNA fragment which has been ligated into the HindIII-site of pBR 322. From these studies we could conclude the direction of transcription of the kanamycin resistance gene in plasmid pML 21 with respect to the SalI, SmaI, HincII, KpnI, EcoRI and HindIII restriction sites. The replacement of the small HindIII-EcoRI-fragment in pBR 322 by other DNA fragments from the E. coli chromosome and selection for tcr-phenotypes showed that this system may be very useful for screening and analysis of promotor-containing DNA fragments.
