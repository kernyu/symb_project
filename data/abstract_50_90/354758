The resistance of 260 strains of fecal coliforms, isolated from raw domestic sewage and aerobic lagoon effluent, to ampicillin, aureomycin, chloromycetin, gentamicin, streptomycin, sulfadiazine, and tetracycline, was determined. Aerobic lagoon treatment produced a 20-fold reduction in the fecal coliform numbers. No statistically significant difference in antibiotic resistance was observed between the fecal coliforms found in raw sewage and in lagoon effluent despite a trend towards the loss of resistance in the latter. Antibiotic resistance, either single or multiple, did not contribute to, or detract from, bacterial survival in the aerobic lagoon. Of the isolates, 15% showed resistance to two or more antiobiotics.
