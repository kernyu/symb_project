The in vitro pyrimethamine sensitivity of 20 Plasmodium falciparum isolates from Papua New Guinea children was determined. The children were treated with sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine and six were found to have clinically resistant malaria. The P. falciparum isolated from these subjects were more resistant to pyrimethamine in vitro than 13 of the isolates from sensitive cases. These results suggest that pyrimethamine sensitivity alone may be a good indicator of in vitro response to sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine.
