The resistance of mice to encephalomyocarditis (EMC) virus was markedly decreased by prior exposure to whole body X-irradiation. In contrast to non-irradiated controls, the course of EMC virus infection in X-irradiated animals was characterized by (a) an enhanced mortality, (b) shortening of the incubation period, (c) higher levels of virus in the blood during the viremic phase and persistence of the viremia until death, (d) failure to develop detectable serum levels of neutralizing antibody, and (e) the earlier appearance and higher levels of virus in brain and heart tissue. The level of interferon in the serum during the course of infection was similar in both groups. The administration of relatively small quantities of anti-EMC virus neutralizing antibody to X-irradiated mice during the early phases of the infection with EMC virus restored their resistance to levels comparable to nonirradiated animals. An alteration of local organ defense mechanisms in the central nervous system could not be demonstrated. It is proposed that (a) the inability of the X-irradiated animal to elaborate specific neutralizing antibody was a critical determinant in their failure to clear the viremia, (b) this increase in the level and duration of the viremic phase resulted in the exposure of target organs to a greater inoculum of virus, and (c) the enhanced mortality observed in irradiated mice reflected this greater target organ involvement. The experimental model presented, therefore, suggests that the immunologic response is a critical determinant of host resistance during this primary systemic virus infection.
