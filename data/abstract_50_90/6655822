Some 23 patients suffering from severe gastrointestinal infections were treated with cefoxitin (CFX) at the Bokuto Metropolitan Hospital, surgical ward, from September to November, 1982. Clinical examinations were conducted and the findings bacteriologically evaluated. The following clinical results were obtained: Of 23 patients, 11 were treated for diffuse peritonitis, 5 for localized peritonitis, and 7 for cholangitis. Following treatment, 5 were judged "excellent", 12 "good", 4 "fair", and 2 "poor." The clinical efficacy rate was 74%. Antibiotic disc susceptibility testings for ampicillin, cephalexin, gentamicin, and CFX were conducted. Gram-negative rods, such as E. coli, Klebsiella sp., Proteus sp., and especially, anaerobic B. fragilis, indicated susceptibility to CFX. B. fragilis was resistant to the remaining 3 antibiotics. Transient elevations in S-GOT and S-GPT levels were observed in 2 patients. However, this was not thought to be caused by CFX. No other irregularities were found. CFX is considered to be a drug of first choice for the treatment of severe gastrointestinal infections. However, for infections due to mixed Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other bacteria, concomitant treatment with CFX and an aminoglycoside is recommended.
