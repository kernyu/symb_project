Rocephin (Ro 13-9904, ceftriaxone) is a new injectable 3d generation cephalosporin characterised by a high intrinsic activity, a high resistance to beta-lactamases and a half-life of 8 h which is 4-10 times as long as the half-lives of the other cephalosporins. We administered Rocephin intravenously at a dosage of 2 x 1 g/day in 23 cases of septicaemia confirmed by positive blood cultures. The results achieved were good in 21 cases (cure of the infection episode), fair in 1 case (need to supplement Rocephin with ampicillin) and poor in 1 case of septicaemia due to resistant enterococci. The clinical and biological tolerance was excellent, and administration was particularly easy.
