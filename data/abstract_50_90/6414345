Combinations of EDTA-tromethamine and 7 antimicrobial agents (chloramphenicol, nalidixic acid, oxytetracycline, penicillin, polymyxin-B, streptomycin, and triple sulfa) were tested for synergistic activities against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Three in vitro tests were used, including minimal inhibitory concentrations of the drugs, a 2-dimensional Microtiter checkerboard technique, and bacterial inhibition studies. A synergistic inhibitory action was observed with combinations of EDTA-tromethamine plus penicillin and EDTA-tromethamine plus oxytetracycline. When chloramphenicol, streptomycin, nalidixic acid, polymyxin-B, or triple sulfa was mixed with EDTA-tromethamine, synergistic action did not occur.
