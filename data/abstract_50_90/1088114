A total of 704 Salmonella strains isolated from various sources were tested for their resistance to chloramphenicol. The results indicate that 36 out of 46 serotypes, comprising 671 strains (95.4%), were sensitive to chloramphenicol up to a level of 10 mug per ml of medium. Most of the strains were sensitive at concentrations between 2 mug and 4 mug of chloramphenicol per ml of medium. None of the strains isolated from animals, including poultry, was resistant. The results indicate that in India resistance of Salmonella strains to chloramphenicol has not increased over the years though this may have occurred in other parts of the world.
