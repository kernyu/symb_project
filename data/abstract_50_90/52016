Methicillin resistance in Staphylococcus aureus has been one of the major problems of gram positive infections in hospitals in the Zurich area. Up to 1971, about 20% of staphylococcal disease was caused by these peculiar organisms. Since 1972, however, a gradual decrease in the number of methicillin-resistant organisms has been observed, with an unprecedented low of 3% in 1975. The nearly 700 methicillin-resistant cultures that have isolated since 1965 exhibited, with rare exceptions, conventional group-II patterns of lysis in phage-typing and similar antibiotypes. It is suggested that all these isolates are derivatives of a strain which has long existed in the staphylococcal population. The reasons for the changes in the frequency of this strain as an agent causing staphylococcal disease are unclear. The use of penicillinase-resistant beta-lactam antibiotics in hospitals does not seem to play a major role in the distribution and spread or in the disappearance of this strain.
