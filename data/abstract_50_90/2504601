Cilofungin (LY121019) was shown to have potent fungicidal activity against clinical isolates of Candida albicans and Candida tropicalis but not Candida parapsilosis. Fungicidal activity was evident against both replicating and non-replicating Candida albicans and was progressive over the first 12 h of incubation. The combination of cilofungin (LY121019) with anticapsin but not with amphotericin B, ketoconazole or 5-fluorocytosine resulted in synergistic fungicidal activity. This compound warrants further investigation of its safety and efficacy in the treatment of Candida infections.
