In vitro susceptibilities of bacterial pathogens to beta-lactam antibiotics were determined. Bacterial pathogens examined included various isolates from patients of respiratory tract infections at hospitals of Kyoto-Shiga area in 1984. Major organisms isolated from clinical specimens were Pseudomonas spp., Klebsiella spp., Haemophilus spp., Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus spp. An increase in the isolation frequency of Pseudomonas spp., a decrease in the isolation frequency of S. aureus, and no change in the isolation frequency of other organisms were observed between the years 1981, 1983 and 1984. Data from susceptibility tests of clinical isolates confirmed that cefazolin (CEZ), cefamandole and cefotiam (CTM) showed good antibacterial activity against S. aureus and cefmenoxime (CMX) was highly active against Streptococcus spp., but their susceptibilities to CEZ in 1984 were lower than in 1983. Susceptibilities of Klebsiella spp. to CMX, cefbuperazone, latamoxef, CTM, cefoperazone (CPZ) were better than those to other beta-lactam antibiotics tested, but there was a decline in the susceptibility to CEZ, cefmetazole and CTM. Further, CMX, CPZ and LMOX also showed good antibacterial activity against Haemophilus spp. Although gentamicin, cefsulodin, cefpiramide and piperacillin were highly active against Pseudomonas spp., resistant organisms were present for all the beta-lactam antibiotics tested.
