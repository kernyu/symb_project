Kinetics of antimicrobial effect (AME) of ampicillin/sulbactam combinations (ratios of 4:1 to 1:2) on ampicillin resistant bacterial strains producing beta-lactamases of types II, III, IV and V according to Richmond classification was studied with using the computerized system MS-2 (turbidimetric recording) and an in vitro dynamic model (microcalorimetric recording). The concentrations of the drugs in system MS-2 (static conditions) corresponded to the maximum ones observed in serum of humans after bolus intravenous administration of ampicillin in a dose of 0.5 g and sulbactam in doses of 0.125 to 0.5 g. The pharmacokinetic profiles of the drugs observed in the human serum after their oral and intravenous administration and in the tissue-chamber fluid after intravenous administration of ampicillin (0.5 g) and sulbactam (0.125 g) were simulated in the dynamic model. The combination efficacy was estimated with using the parameter of AME duration (TE) reflecting shifts in the curves of the microbial regrowth in the presence of the drugs against the curve of the control growth (in the absence of the drugs) and the parameter of the AME intensity (IE) evaluated by the area between the curves. It was noted that increasing of the ampicillin/sulbactam ratio from 1:4 to 1:1 was accompanied by an increase in the AME. Further increasing of the sulbactam content in the combination did not result in higher AME. For combined ampicillin/sulbactam dosage forms the ratios of 1:1 to 2:1 should be recommended.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
