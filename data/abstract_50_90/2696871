Thirty six clinical isolates of Cryptococcus neoformans were tested for their susceptibility to 5-fluorocytosine and amphotericin B by the determination of minimum inhibitory concentrations and minimum fungicidal concentrations. 22.2% of the isolates were resistant to 5-fluorocytosine and 36.1% indicated 5-fluorocytosine tolerance. All strains were sensitive to amphotericin B.
