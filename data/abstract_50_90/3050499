The mutagenicity of nifurtimox (nfx) and 8 nfx analogues has been investigated with the L-arabinose forward-mutation assay of Salmonella typhimurium. The nfx analogues tested were obtained by replacing the 3-methyl-4-yl-tetrahydro-1,4-thiazine-1,1-dioxide group of the parent compound with the following other groups: indazol-1-yl (1); pyrazol-1-yl (2); benzimidazol-1-yl (3); 1,2,4-triazol-4-yl (4); 1-methyl-3-methylthio-1,2,4-triazol-4-yl-5-thione (5); 3,5-bis(methylthio)-1,2,4-triazol-4-yl (6); 1-adamantyl (7); 4,6-diphenylpyridin-1-yl-2-one (8). The mutagenic activity of each chemical was determined by the standard plate-incorporation test, in the presence or absence of the S9 activation mixture. The 9 compounds were mutagenic and exhibited linear dose-mutagenic response relationships. They were direct-acting mutagens and showed a nearly 1000-fold range in mutagenic potency from chemical 1 to nfx. In most cases, the addition of S9 mixture to the test plates decreased the mutagenicity of compounds. This effect was particularly noticeable in the case of chemicals 1-3, 5 and 7 where a more than 70% decrease in mutagenic activity was observed in the presence of the S9 mixture. The mutagenic potency of compounds in the Ara test showed a negative linear correlation with previously reported antitrypanosomal activity. Thus, chemicals 6 and 8 with in vitro activities against Trypanosoma cruzi clearly superior to that of nfx showed 2 of the lowest mutagenic potencies in the Ara test and these were only somewhat higher than the mutagenicity of the reference drug.
