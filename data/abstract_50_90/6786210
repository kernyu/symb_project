Altogether 158 strains of P. aeruginosa isolated from the material of open and close cavities and blood of patients with bronchopulmonary diseases were studied. It was found that the majority of the virulent (92.6 per cent) and avirulent (70.3 per cent) cultures were characterized by multiple resistance to tetracycline, streptomycin, monomycin, kanamycin, levomycetin and polymyxin B with preserved sensitivity to gentamicin and carbenicillin. The source of the P. aeruginosa isolation had a significant influence on its relation to the effect of antibiotics: the highest number of the resistant cultures was isolated from the blood. No differences in the antibiotic effect on P. aeruginosa depending on the serotype were observed. No differences in the antibiotic effect on P. aeruginosa depending on the serotype were observed. Virulent cultures of P. aeruginosa typed with group agglutinating sera and isolated from the material of the open and close cavities were characterized by a higher resistance level to tetracycline, kanamycin, monomycin and levomycetin than the virulent not-typed strains.
