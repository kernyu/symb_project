Today Staphylococcus epidermidis has been recognized as the etiological agent of infectious diseases such as endocarditis, sepsis and meningitis that mainly come out in compromised hosts because of the breaching of the mechanical barrier (cardiosurgical, neurosurgical patients and central venous catheter carriers). Other "non-epidermidis coagulase negative Staphylococci" are more and more frequently isolated from patients at high risk of infection. Faced with these isolations, it is difficult for the clinician and the microbiologist to give these microorganisms their effective pathogenic role. The Authors present a case list of seriously compromised patients in whom non-epidermidis coagulase negative Staphylococci were repeatedly isolated: hemato-oncological patients: the Authors mark out 6 cases of sepsis that is, likely, to be linked to a central venous catheter. The isolated microorganisms were: S. warneri (3 cases); S. haemolyticus (1 case); S. hominis (1 case); S. xylosus (1 case); neurosurgical patients: in whom 3 cases of cerebro-spinal fluid infection were observed; 3 patients carried a ventriculo-peritoneal derivation; 1 patient carried an Ommaya's device. The etiological agents were S. haemolyticus in 2 cases, S. capitis in 1 case. The Authors point out the multiresistance of some strains (S. haemolyticus) and the oxacillin-methicillin resistance phenomenon. They also underline the need for a specific identification of coagulase-negative Staphylococci and the importance of a strict collaboration between clinicians and microbiologists in order to get a correct interpretation of the role played by these microorganisms in infectious diseases of the compromised host.
