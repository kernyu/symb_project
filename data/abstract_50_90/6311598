An antimycin A-resistant derivative of the human cell line, D98, has been obtained by selective mutagenesis with N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine. The derivative, designed MA65, is capable of continuous growth in 15 microM antimycin and the resistant phenotype is stable in the absence of selection. MA65 is not cross-resistant to chloramphenicol or triethyl tin. Crude membrane preparations from MA65 after propagation in medium containing antimycin have normal succinate-cytochrome c oxidoreductase activity and the respiratory activity of whole cells continues in the presence of the drug. The mitochondrially synthesized proteins of D98 and MA65 are similar when compared on sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS), or isoelectric focusing gels, but there is a reproducible difference in the extent of labelling of one band detected by isoelectric focusing. Genetic analysis is consistent with the existence of a cytoplasmically localized determinant conferring resistance.
