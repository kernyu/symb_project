Swab specimens obtained from skin lesions of 45 cats were cultured bacteriologically for staphylococci. Thirty-two staphylococcal isolates were recovered from 30 cats and were biotyped, using biochemical tests contained in a staphylococcal identification system. Of 23 isolates considered coagulase-positive, 16 were identified as Staphylococcus aureus, 5 as S intermedius, and 2 as S hyicus. Of 9 isolates considered coagulase-negative, 6 were identified as S simulans, 2 as S epidermidis, and 1 as S xylosus. Antimicrobial susceptibility tests were done on all staphylococcal isolates, using a disk-diffusion method. Staphylococcal isolates were susceptible to clavulanic acid-amoxicillin, cloxacillin, cephalothin, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, erythromycin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Resistance to penicillin G, ampicillin, and tetracycline was frequent.
