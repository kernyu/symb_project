In this study, candida sp. and all other microorganisms were attempted to be isolated in 30 patients with non-gonococcal urethritis who hadn't responded to classical antimicrobial therapy. Candida sp. in 6, various bacteries in 11, salmonella in one and trichomonas vaginalis in one of them were detected. Not any microorganisms were isolated in 13, 4 of these candida species which were detected by sabouraud culture, were also evaluated by direct microspoic examination.
