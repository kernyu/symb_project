Molecular epidemiology has provided several clues about the antimicrobial resistance genes of nosocomial, multiresistant coagulase-negative staphylococci. First, it has shown that a huge reservoir of resistance genes is maintained in these organisms on the bodies of both patients and the hospital personnel who care for them. In turn, extensive use of antimicrobial agents within specific sectors of the hospital probably provides selection pressure for the evolution and amplification of these genes. Secondly, indirect evidence suggests that Staphylococcus epidermidis may itself serve as a reservoir for antimicrobial resistance genes that are transferred to S. aureus.
