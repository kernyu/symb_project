Spontaneous mutants Km-R and Tc-R of R. japonicum with various levels of resistance to kanamycin (0.8-20 mg/ml) and tetracycline (130-210 micrograms/ml) were isolated. No cross resistance in the mutants was observed. Plasmid R68.45 transferred to the wild strains resistance to 210 micrograms/ml of tetracycline and to 20 mg/ml of kanamycin. This plasmid did not practically increase the resistance to tetracycline in mutants Tc-R. At the same time it markedly increased the resistance to kanamycin in mutants Km-R.
