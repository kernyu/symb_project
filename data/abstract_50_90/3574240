A total of 114 Clostridium difficile strains were analysed for a possible correlation between serological susceptibility to chloramphenicol, tetracycline and clindamycin, and serogrouping. All 17 chloramphenicol-resistant strains belonged to serovar I, while none of 32 tetracycline-resistant strains belonged to serovar I. All strains included in serovar III were tetracycline- and clindamycin-resistant.
