Sensitivity to 15 drugs of 248 P. aeruginosa strains isolated from patients with infected burns was studied by the method of agar dilution. All of the strains were resistant to polymyxin M, ceporin, erythromycin and oleandomycin. Most of the strains were resistant to streptomycin, monomycin, ampicillin and rifadin. Moderate resistance of the strains to carbenicillin, morphocycline, vibramycin, kanamycin, tetraolean and tetracycline was observed: the maximum concentrations of these antibiotics (128 microgram/ml) inhibited the growth of 85, 69, 63, 51.8, 43.6 and 41.2 per cent of the strains respectively. Gentamicin proved to be most active against the strains of P. aeruginosa and inhibited 87 per cent of the strains when used in the therapeutic doses. The study provided recomendation of the drugs for parenteral and local use in treatment of burns infected with P. aeruginosa.
