Several strains of Candida parapsilosis, isolated independently in our laboratory, had their resistance compared to a series of inhibitors which act either at the level of mitochondrial ribosomes (chloramphenicol, erythromycin, paromomycin) or at the level of mitochondrial respiration and oxidative phosphorylation (oligomycin, antimycin A, diuron, carbonylcyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone). Cells were grown on glycerol media supplemented with one of these inhibitors, and it was demonstrated that the resistance of these yeasts to a large spectrum of antibiotics was due to several features: a resistance to oligomycin was found at the permeation level; the resistance to the other drugs was correlated to the relative insensitivity of cytochrome biosynthesis to the drugs; the cells developed, at the same time, two types of alternative pathways: the one branched at the ubiquinone level which drove electrons from Krebs cycle substrates to oxygen, and the other, antimycin A-insensitive but inhibited by amytal, salicylhydroxamic acid and high cyanide concentrations. This secondary mitochondrial pathway, driving reducing equivalents from cytoplasmic NADH to cytochrome c and then to cytochrome aa3 or to alternate oxidase, allowed the growth of Candida parapsilosis on a non fermentescible medium, supplemented with these drugs.
