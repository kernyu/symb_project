We applied the direct immunoperoxidase method to estimate the susceptibility to IDU of 17 strains of the virus which were isolated from the patients with active epithelial lesions of herpetic keratitis. All the strains were found to be sensitive below the IDU concentration of 5 micrograms/ml. The findings obtained by this method were in good agreement with those by the fluorescent antibody technique. The present method is specific and simple. It offers clear-cut interpretation and a permanent record of the results.
