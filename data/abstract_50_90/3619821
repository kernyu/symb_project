Coccidia were isolated from 90 broiler farms in 15 poultry-producing areas in Brazil and Argentina. Sixty isolates were tested for sensitivity to 7 anticoccidial drugs. The common species were: a) Eimeria tenella, 47 isolates; b) E. maxima, 49 isolates; c) E. acervulina, 44 isolates; d) E. mitis, 26 isolates; and e) E. brunetti, 12 isolates. Isolates were considered sensitive to drugs if intestinal lesion scores of medicated broilers were reduced by at least 50% compared with unmedicated infected broilers or if weight gain was at least 75% of that of uninfected birds in a 6-day laboratory test. According to lesion scores, there was evidence of resistance or seriously reduced sensitivity to monensin in 20 isolates, narasin in 29, salinomycin in 11, maduramicin in 1, clopidol in 36, amprolium in 40, and nicarbazin in 1. According to broiler weight gain, there was resistance to monensin in 36 isolates, narasin in 32, salinomycin in 28, maduramicin in 2, clopidol in 28, amprolium in 50, and nicarbazin in 4. These results suggested incomplete cross resistance of coccidia to polyether ionophorous drugs. The degree of resistance might be explained by previous patterns of use of these drugs.
