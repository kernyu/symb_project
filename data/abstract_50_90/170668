In antibacterial susceptibility testing by the agar plate dilution method with 252 strains of Clostridium perfringens, 22 strains of C. novyi type A and 7 of C. novyi type B, with 21 strains of C. bifermentans, 12 strains of C. sordellii and 18 of C. sporogenes, the majority of the strains were inhibited by penicillin G, cephalothin, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, tinidazole and metronidazole. Resistance to lincomycin and clindamycin was noticed among strains of all clostridia species as well as to tetracycline and doxycycline among strains of C. perfringens.
