The comparative in vitro activities of cefixime, penicillin G, amoxicillin, cefotaxime, cefaclor, cefadroxyl, cefotiam and cefuroxime against 83 recent clinical isolates of S. pneumoniae were determined. In addition, the susceptibilities of 17 relatively or fully penicillin-resistant strains of S. pneumoniae were evaluated. Cefixime was more active than the first generation cephalosporins cefaclor and cefadroxyl against penicillin-susceptible strains. The MIC50 and MIC90 obtained by the agar dilution method were 0.25 and 0.5 mg/l respectively. The MICs obtained by a microdilution technique were one dilution lower. Cefixime exhibited little or no activity against relatively or fully penicillin-resistant strains.
