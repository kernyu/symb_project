During the ten year study i.e. 1978 to 1987, out of 53,251 cases of suspected enteric fever, S.typhi was isolated from 4005 cases (7%) and S.para typhi 'A' from 1108 cases (2.5%). A total of 52 strains of S. typhi and 4 strains of S.para typhi 'A' were found to be resistant to chloramphenicol. Minimal inhibitory concentration was greater than 256 micrograms/ml of all the strains of S.typhi and S.para typhi 'A'.
