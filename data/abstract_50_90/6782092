Expression of tetracycline resistance by genes originating in the Bacillus plasmid pAB124 was examined in both Bacillus subtilis and Escherichia coli host cells. Expression of resistance in B. subtilis by genes from pAB124 was inducible and associated with decreased accumulation of the antibiotic. A fragment of pAB124 carrying the genes coding for tetracycline resistance was cloned into the E. coli plasmid RSF2124. The cloned fragment conferred a low level of resistance in E. coli, but this was not associated with decreased uptake of tetracycline and was not inducible.
