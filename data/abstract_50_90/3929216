Susceptibility to cefotiam of 494 bacterial strains was studied by MIC determination using an agar dilution assay. Activity of cefotiam was also compared with that of six other beta-lactams (ampicillin, mezlocillin, ticarcillin, cefalotin, cefotaxime, and moxalactam) using an agar diffusion method. Cefotiam showed a wide antibacterial spectrum including more than 70% of Enterobacteriaceae (except Serratia), beta-lactamase-producing and non-beta-lactamase-producing Haemophilus influenzae, non-enterococcus streptococci, and penicillinase-producing and non-penicillinase-producing staphylococci susceptible to methicillin. Conversely, cefotiam was inactive against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter anitratum, Streptococcus faecalis, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
