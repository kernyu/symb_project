Seven critical tests in equids were conducted with single doses of fenbendazole (5 mg kg-1) alone (Panacur--American Hoechst, Somerville, NJ); (2 tests with paste and 1 with suspension formulation) or in combination with piperazine (American Hoechst); (40 mg base kg-1); (4 tests with paste formulation). The main purpose of the tests was evaluation of activity against benzimidazole-resistant small strongyles (Cyathostomum catinatum, Cyathostomum coronatum, Cylicocyclus nassatus, Cylicostephanus goldi, and Cylicostephanus longibursatus). Natural infections of 2 populations of benzimidazole-resistant small strongyles were evaluated; 1 was population B in 2 horses and the other was population S in 5 ponies. Removal of the 5 species of population B was 49-91% in the animal treated with fenbendazole paste alone and 100% (4 of these species present) in the animal treated with the combination. For population S, 2 of the 5 resistant species were present in small numbers in 1 animal treated with fenbendazole paste alone and all were removed; the 1 animal receiving fenbendazole suspension alone had removals of 0-70% for the 5 benzimidazole-resistant species. Also for population S, the 5 resistant species were present in 2 animals treated with the paste combination and removal was 98-100% and of 4 of the 5 resistant species in 1 animal, removal was 76-99%. Removal of large strongyles (Strongylus vulgaris and Strongylus edentatus) was 92-100% for fenbendazole paste alone or in combination with piperazine in the 5 infected animals. For Oxyuris equi, present in 1 animal treated with the combination, there was 91% removal of immature and 100% removal of mature specimens. There probHably was no activity by fenbendazole alone or the combination against bots, tapeworms, and parenteral stages of S. vulgaris and S. edentatus. The combination may have had some activity against immature Habronema spp. and mature abronema muscae.
