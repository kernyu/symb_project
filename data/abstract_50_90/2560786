The effects of imuthiol (sodium ditiocarb, DTC) on the expression of cytotoxic responses (CTL) and natural killer (NK) activity were evaluated in aged and young euthymic mice, and in nu/nu BALB/c mice. Imuthiol generated CTL and concomitantly reduced NK activity in nu/nu mice, suggesting that the agent can generate T cells in athymic nude animals. Treatment for up to 4 months augmented spleen NK and CTL activities in young or aged euthymic mice, but the generation of CTL in old animals was increased by long-term treatments better than by a single injection. The capacity of imuthiol to activate specific and nonspecific cytotoxic functions in euthymic mice may contribute to enhancement of resistance in vivo against transformed cells after treatment with this agent.
