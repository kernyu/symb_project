A technique was developed for microinjection and transformation of Aedes triseriatus mosquitoes. Mosquito ova can be readily microinjected with approximately 0.9 nl of inoculum if desiccated and inoculated before hardening of the chorion. Ova were injected with molecular constructs that conferred antibiotic (G418) resistance to larvae. Insertion of the antibiotic resistance construct into the mosquito genome was demonstrated by Southern blot analysis.
