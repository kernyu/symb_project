Influenza A virus recombinants derived from "resistant" and "sensitive" parental viruses were examined for susceptibility to inhibition by amantadine. Correlation of gene constellation and amantadine susceptibility revealed that the gene coding for M protein influences sensitivity or resistance to amantadine. All recombinants which derived an M protein from an amantadine-resistant parent were found to be resistant to amantadine. All amantadine-sensitive recombinants derived an M gene from the amantadine-sensitive parent. However, a few amantadine-resistant recombinants which derived an M gene from the sensitive parent were also isolated, suggesting that the expression of amantadine sensitivity in these recombinants may be influenced by other genes.
