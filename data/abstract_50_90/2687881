It has been hypothesized that genomic fluidity is an important component of tumorigenesis. Previous studies described the relationship between tumorigenicity and one marker for genomic fluidity, gene amplification. In this report, these studies are extended with the rat liver epithelial cell lines to show that: (i) the amplification in these cells arises in a spontaneous fashion in the population (i.e., the variants detected are not preexisting in the population), and (ii) the rate of spontaneous amplification (mutation), as measured by Luria-Delbruck fluctuation analysis, is significantly lower in the nontumorigenic cells than in the tumorigenic cells. The rate was estimated by using the Po method and the method of means. The rate of spontaneous amplification of the gene encoding the multifunctional protein CAD (containing the enzymatic activities carbamoyl-phosphate synthase, aspartate transcarbamylase, and dihydroorotase) in the highly tumorigenic cells was significantly greater than that for the nontumorigenic cells, reaching almost 1 x 10(-4) events per cell per generation. The rate of this mutagenic event is high compared to the rate of point mutations usually reported in mammalian cells, and its potential contribution to the tumorigenic process will be discussed.
