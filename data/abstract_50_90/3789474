Rapid identification and antimicrobial testing of Enterobacteriaceae by an automated system, the ABAC-Identibiogramme. The system was directly inoculated with a dilution of positive blood culture broths. The results were compared with those of API 20E and the disk method for antibiogram. The ratios of agreement of 94.5% for identification and of 93.4% for antimicrobial testing demonstrate a good accuracy of the ABAC-Identibiogramme.
