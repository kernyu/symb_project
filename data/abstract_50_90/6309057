Cefotaxime levels were measured in the middle ears of 12 children, after operations for insertion of a transtympanic aerator for serous or relapsing otitis. Mean auricular cefotaxime levels were 4,3 and 5,1 mcg/ml on the right and left respectively. Mean serum level one hour after 25 mg/kg i.m. was 14,5 mcg/ml. In can be concluded that cefotaxime penetrates effectively into the middle ear. Its use should be reserved for difficult or menacing cases of otitis, but its bacteriological activity with regard to Haemophilus influenzae and certain enterobacteria is of value in cases where ampicillins may be ineffective due to resistance of strains.
