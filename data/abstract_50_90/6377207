E. coli is the agent most frequently isolated in urinary infection. In 1982, rates of E. coli isolation were 87% in outpatient laboratories, 63% in general hospitals and 41% in specialized hospitals. Susceptibility to ampicillin was less frequent in outpatients (43%) than in hospitalized patients (67%). In both, isolated strains were susceptible to the major urinary antiseptics ( furans , nalidixic acid, pipemidic acid) and even more so to aminoglycosides. Resistance to beta-lactams was compared in outpatients (1981) and general hospital patients (1982):TEM plasmid resistance was found in 72% and 57% of strains respectively. Resistance to quinolones was unremarkable for all strains studied except for one NALs PIPr phenotype strain recovered from an outpatient.
