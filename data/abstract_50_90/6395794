The intestinal form of salmonellosis caused by S. typhimurium and the host immunity were studied in 108 infants. 60 infants were treated with ampicillin and the other 48 infants with tobramycin. The recovery period in patients treated with tobramycin was 8 days less as compared to the patients treated with ampicillin After discontinuation of the tobramycin use the pathogen was not detected in the repeated platings. Bactericidal function of neutrophils in these patients returned to normal within 15 days after the beginning of the treatment. Tobramycin was shown to be a highly active antibiotic in the treatment of salmonellosis of infants. No side effects were observed.
