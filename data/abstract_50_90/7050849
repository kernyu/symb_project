This study reports the evolution of bacterial ecology during twelve years in a general hospital : prevalence of the different species isolated and their resistance to antibiotics. It appears, in the etiology of serious infections, a great stability in the repartition of bacterial groups responsible. Likewise, the evolution of bacterial resistance during this period did not show a gradual increase. A certain balance seems to occur in function of local conditions, among which a controlled use of antibiotics is certainly an important factor.
