The results of the comparative study of antibiotic sensitivity of 138 Salmonella strains isolated from children patients in Krasnodar are presented. The isolates belonged to 9 serological types and were classified into 4 serogroups. Salmonella fo group B prevailed. The highest sensitivity was found with respect to neomycin. Strains sensitive to levomycetin and streptomycin were rare. Single strains were sensitive to all antibiotics tested. A tendency to polyresistance in ever increasing numbers of the strains was noted, which should be taken into consideration in treatment of salmonellesis in children with antibacterial drugs.
