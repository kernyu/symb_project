Primary cultures of rat hepatocytes were used to study the release of hepatic lipase and very low density lipoprotein (VLDL). The presence of hepatic lipase activity was proved by salt-resistance, affinity chromatography and inactivation by a hepatic lipase antibody. Cellular rate of hepatic lipase release increased by prolonged time in culture, whereas VLDL secretion decreased. Oleic acid and dextran-70 had no effect on release of hepatic lipase, whereas VLDL secretion was increased and decreased, respectively. Calcium antagonists (cobalt and verapamil), monensin and cycloheximide inhibited both the release of hepatic lipase and VLDL. Colchicine and chloroquine, which decreased VLDL secretion, had no effect on release of hepatic lipase. The present results suggest that release of hepatic lipase and secretion of VLDL are not coordinated and exhibit different sensitivity towards certain compounds altering secretory functions.
