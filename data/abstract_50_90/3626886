The in vitro attachment of 49 Proteus spp. to human urinary tract epithelial cells was determined. The antibacterial spectrum to all species of the Proteus isolates from hospitalized patients was measured against the most common antibiotics (Amikacin, Cefamandole, Cefoxitin, Ceftriaxone, Cephalothin, Kanamycin, Nalidixic acid, Oxolinic acid, Pipemidic acid, Piromidic acid, Tobramycin). 18 of them were multiresistant and the other 31 expressed susceptibility to the above antibiotics. Bacterial adherence to uroepithelial cells was studied in relation to susceptibility on antibiotics. The mean of bacteria per cell for the 31 strains grouped as susceptible was 20.2 and for the 18 strains grouped as resistant the mean was 55.1. Our results demonstrate a significant relationship between bacterial adhesion and antibiotic susceptibility pattern by Student's t test (P less than 0.01).
