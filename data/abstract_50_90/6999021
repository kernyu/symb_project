A total of 509 clinical isolates of Enterobacteriaceae were tested for susceptibility to cefamandole by Autobac 1 and Bauer-Kirby disk diffusion methods, using commercially available 30-micrograms cefamandole disks. Minimal inhibitory concentrations were determined for all organisms showing major or very major discrepancies. Overall agreement between Autobac 1 and disk diffusion was 89.8%, with 5.1% major or very major and 5.1% minor discrepancies. When considering only the genera for which 20 or more isolates were tested, overall agreement was 90.8%. Discrepancies for Escherichia coli showed a trend toward resistance by Autobac 1, with minimal inhibitory concentrations generally in agreement with disk diffusion results. No trends were detected for other genera. The rate of agreement was lower for Enterobacter species (75.4%), but minimal inhibitory concentrations, determined for all discrepancies in this genus, agreed with Autobafc 1 as often a with disk diffusion results.
