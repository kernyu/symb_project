The present study was designed to define the clinical activity and pharmacokinetics of ceftazidime in Pseudomonas sp. infections. The intensive care patients included in this study were hospitalized for at least 2 weeks and have frequently received antibiotic treatment which contributed with poor host resistance to the infections with highly resistant Pseudomonas strains. Sixteen adult patients entered the study. Their age ranged from 18 to 70 years. Ceftazidime was administered in a dose of 2 g three times daily by a constant infusion over 20-30 min. Frequent clinical assessment multiple cultures and determination of renal, hepatic and bacteriological functions were performed. Bacterial cultures were obtained prior to the beginning of therapy and every 2-3 days thereafter with a follow-up period of about 1-2 weeks. Pharmacokinetics in the blood were performed. Measurements of ceftazidime were made by using HPLC. Mean peak serum concentration of ceftazidime was 58.5 micrograms/ml after administration of 2.0 g of ceftazidime and eight hours after dosing the mean plasma concentration was about 5 micrograms/ml. No accumulation of ceftazidime could be observed during the treatment period. Mean plasma half-life was 2.1 hours at the beginning and 2.2 hours at the end of therapy. The mean apparent volume distribution was 0.35 l/kg. No severe adverse effects were reported throughout the study. Ceftazidime may be effectively used as single antiinfective agent in various conditions and higher plasma concentrations are an important predictor of bacteriological and clinical response in pulmonary infections caused by Pseudomonas species.
