Formaldehyde resistance of methylotrophic and non-methylotrophic Acetobacter strains was investigated. A facultatively methylotrophic Acetobacter methanolicus (MB58) gets rid of free formaldehyde by assimilating it. Heterotrophically growing cells tolerate 12 mM free formaldehyde. Non-methylotrophic but methanol oxidizing Acetobacter pasteurianus strains possess the same level of formaldehyde resistance. Formaldehyde resistance can be drastically lowered down to 4 mM by blocking the formate dehydrogenase by means of hypophosphite. Acetobacter spp. Martin 1 and LMG 76.10 are not able to oxidize methanol or formaldehyde via formate to CO2 and possess a significantly lower formaldehyde resistance (4 mM). Hence high formaldehyde resistance of the Acetobacter spp. investigated is based above all on a properly operating linear dissimilatory sequence. The dissimilatory RuMP cycle can hardly help detoxify formaldehyde.
