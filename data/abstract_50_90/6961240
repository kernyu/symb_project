Cefmetazole was studied experimentally in the field of dermatology. The following results were obtained. 1. The in vitro antibacterial activities of cefmetazole against S. aureus and S. epidermidis were studied. Most strains of both staphylococci were inhibited by 1.56 micrograms/ml or less of cefmetazole. 2. Serum and skin concentrations of cefmetazole in rats were studied after intramuscular administration of 20 mg/kg of cefmetazole. Mean serum concentrations were 40.3, 21.5, 7.1, 0.56 micrograms/ml respectively at 0.25, 0.5, 1 and 2 hours, and the corresponding skin concentrations were 12.5, 6.1, 0.62, 0.61 micrograms/g (n = 4).
