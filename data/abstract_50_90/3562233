Halobacterium (H.) halobium and H. cutirubrum mutants resistant to the anti-80S ribosome targeted inhibitor anisomycin were isolated. Three classes of mutants were obtained: Class I displayed a minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) to anisomycin of 10 micrograms/ml, class II of 25 micrograms/ml and class III of at least 400 micrograms/ml. In vitro polyphenylalanine synthesis assays demonstrated that in those cases tested resistance was a property of the large ribosomal subunit. By primer extension analysis, each mutation class could be correlated with a distinct base change within the peptidyltransferase loop of 235 rRNA. In class I A2472 was changed to C, in class II G2466 was changed to C and in the high-level resistant class III C2471 was replaced by U. A. double mutant - obtained by selection of a class I mutant for high-level anisomycin resistance - acquired the C2471 to U replacement of class III in addition to the class I mutation. The results provide information on the action of a eukaryotic protein synthesis inhibitor on archaebacterial ribosomes and demonstrate the suitability of organisms with a single rRNA transcriptional unit on the chromosome for direct selection of mutations in ribosomal RNA.
