A mathematical model has been analyzed for the liberation process of substances (chloramphenicol) from emulsive ointments (W/O). Limitarying approximations have been derived which are useful for practical calculations. These approximations have been elaborated for the following cases: since the mass transfer resistance of diffusing substance occurs in the continuous phase, since the mass transfer resistance occurs only in the dispersed phase, then the mass transfer resistance in both phases is comparable. Experimental investigations have been carried out for the liberation process of substances from emulsive ointments. A good qualitative agreement has been found between the theoretical projections and experimental results.
