In Gram-negative bacteria, beta-lactam antibiotics must overcome two barriers, the outer membrane and the periplasmic beta-lactamase, before they reach the targets of their action, penicillin-binding proteins. Although the barrier property of the outer membrane and catalytic property of the beta-lactamases have been studied and their significance in creating beta-lactam resistance emphasized, the interaction between these two barriers has not been treated quantitatively. Such treatment shows that the sensitivity, to a variety of beta-lactams, of the Escherichia coli K-12 cells containing very different levels of chromosomally coded AmpC beta-lactamase, or a plasmid-coded TEM-type beta-lactamase, can be predicted rather accurately from the penetration rate through the outer membrane and the hydrolysis rate in the periplasm. We further propose a new parameter, 'target access index', which is a quantitative expression of the result of interaction between the two barriers, and reflects the probability of success for the antibiotic to reach the targets.
