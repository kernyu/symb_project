The sensitivity of Saccharomyces cerevisiae spores and vegetative cells to various antimicrobial compounds was compared. Sulphur dioxide, benzoic acid, potassium sorbate, salicylic acid, nystatin, actidione and pimaricin were tested. Generally, the Saccharomyces spores were more resistant than the corresponding vegetative cells. It was also observed that this greater resistance shown by the spores varied with the antimicrobial compound used. Only potassium sorbate was not selective and killed both vegetative cells and spores at about the same rate.
