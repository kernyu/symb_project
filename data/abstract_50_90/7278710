Investigation of 136 turkeys (24 manifesting infra-orbital sinusitis, 112 apparently healthy) resulted in isolation of 79 strains of Mycoplasma and 4 of Acholeplasma. By the disc growth inhibition test with 16 reference antisera of avian serogroups, 55 strains were identified serologically and 28 remained unidentified. Thirteen strains of Mycoplasma gallisepticum, 1 of M. meleagridis, and 2 of Acholeplasma laidlawii were isolated from turkey sinusitis whereas serogroups C (2), D (19), F (8), M. meleagridis (4), M. anatis (4), A. laidlawii (2), and 28 unidentified strains were isolated from apparently healthy turkeys. Three patterns were recognized on the basis of glucose, maltose, and sucrose, fermentation. The most frequent, pattern I, included 13 M. gallisepticum strains whereas 5 M. meleagridis strains belonged to fermentation pattern III. Isolates were also studied for reduction of tetrazolium, methylene blue, potassium tellurite, resistance to methylene blue and sodium taurocholate, and production of arginine deiminase and "film and sports." Inoculation of selected isolates into developing chick embryos revealed that 2 A. laidlawii strains were nonpathogenic and 13 M. gallisepticum, 1 serogroup D and 2 serogroup F strains were pathogenic, causing 50--100% mortality. In vitro antibiotic disc sensitivity tests indicated that rovamycin (solubilized spiramycin) may be recommended for turkey mycoplasmosis. Isolation of 2 A. laidlawii strains from turkey sinusitis and 4 M. anatis strains from apparently healthy turkeys appears interesting.
