The survival of antibiotic-resistant and -sensitive strains of Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus equinus, and two environmental isolates, AP17 and AQ62, was examined in estuarine water. Each strain was rendered resistant to a combination of two antibiotics by serial passage in increasing concentrations of antibiotics. Cultures were incubated in filter-sterilized estuarine water for up to 7 days. Recovery was assessed by examining colony-forming ability on media with and without antibiotics. None of the antibiotic-resistant forms survived longer than its antibiotic-sensitive counterpart in estuarine water. Three of the resistant strains died off more rapidly than the antibiotic-sensitive wild type. Survival of the test bacteria in estuarine water was as follows: sensitive and resistant AQ62, resistant Escherichia coli less than sensitive Escherichia coli less than resistant AP17 less than resistant Enterococcus faecium less than sensitive AP17, sensitive and resistant S. equinus less than sensitive and resistant Enterococcus faecalis, sensitive Enterococcus faecium. The results supported the suggestion that fecal entercocci may serve as better indicators of fecal pollution than Escherichia coli in marine ecosystems. Moreover, the results indicated that the use of antibiotic-resistant mutants to follow the fate of bacteria in the environment is inappropriate without adequate studies to ensure that resistant and wild-type strains react similarly to environmental stressors.
