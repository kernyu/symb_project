With the purpose of characterizing epidemiologic markers, 240 strains of S. agona isolated from differents sources (man, food and environment) and obtained from five Brazilian States (Minas Gerais, Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Pernambuco and Rio Grande do Sul) were analysed. The susceptibility to 15 antimicrobial agents and numeric codification of the resistance profiles allowed us to recognize 56 antibiotic resistance biotypes, while 40 strains were able to produce colicine, belonging to the types: Ia (55%); B (32.5%); Ib (10%) and untypable (2.5%). The application of these elements into intra-serotype differentiation is discussed.
