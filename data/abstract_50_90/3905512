A gene (cat) for chloramphenicol (Cm) acetyltransferase (CAT) was cloned from Streptomyces acrimycini into S. lividans 66 on the plasmid vector pIJ61. The cat gene was localized on a 1.7-kb BclI fragment, which probably also carries the cat promoter. This DNA fragment conferred Cm resistance, through CAT activity, on S. lividans, S. coelicolor and S. parvulus, but not on Escherichia coli when inserted in the BamHI site of the tetracycline-resistance(TcR) gene of pBR322. However, when inserted in a particular orientation in this site, spontaneous deletions of 0.7 kb led to CAT activity and Cm resistance. DNA homologous to the 1.7-kb BclI cat fragment was found in most, but not all, of a series of other streptomycetes that have CAT activity. The cat provides a potentially useful screening marker for Streptomyces cloning vectors.
