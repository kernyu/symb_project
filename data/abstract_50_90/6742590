Members of the genus Salmonella isolated from chickens, turkeys, cattle, and swine and submitted to the National Veterinary Services Laboratories for serotyping during October 1981 through September 1982 were tested for sensitivity to 12 antibacterial drugs. A total of 3,500 isolates was tested. A high rate of drug resistance was observed. Three cultures were resistant to each of the drugs and 30% were resistant to each drug except chloramphenicol, cephalothin, and gentamicin. Multiple resistance patterns were observed for 80% of the cultures with an even higher percentage in cultures from swine.
