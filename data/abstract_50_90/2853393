The tetracycline resistance gene encoded within the transposon Tn916 was replaced with the gene encoding erythromycin resistance from the plasmid pVA838. The derivative transposon of Tn916 was designated Tn916 delta E and was introduced into the Streptococcus faecalis chromosome by protoplast transformation. The conjugation/transposition functions of Tn916 delta E were similar to those observed for Tn916 in S. faecalis and Tn916 delta E was capable of self-conjugation at frequencies similar to those of other S. faecalis and Group B Streptococcus. This transposon will be useful for mutagenesis studies in gram-positive organisms, especially in those species where erythromycin resistance is a more desirable selectable marker.
