A strain of C. perfringens type A, isolated from a patient, was found to be resistant to four antibiotics: tetracycline (Tet), chloramphenicol (Chl), erythromycin (Ero) and clindamycin (Cli). Clones resistant to only two drugs (Tet-Chl or Ero-Cli), or sensitive to all drugs were found in cultures of the wild-type strain treated by acridine dyes or ethidium bromide. DNA analysis by equilibrium centrifugation confirmed that the original strain contains two resistance plasmids, one called Rip 401 (Tet-Chl) and the other Rip 402 (Ero-Cli), which represent respectively 1.8 +/- 0.2% and 2.3 +/- 0.2% of the total amount of DNA in this strain of Cl. perfrigens.
