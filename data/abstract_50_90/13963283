Cephalothin is 7-(thiophene-2-acetamido) cephalosporanic acid; it was prepared by N-acylation of the nucleus of cephalosporin C, 7-aminocephalosporanic acid. Cephalothin had a broad spectrum of antibiotic activity that was essentially unaffected by human serum or inoculum level, the activity of penicillinase, or pH variation of the growth medium. In vitro development of resistance by staphylococci could not be demonstrated, but the gram-negative organisms did develop a stepwise type of resistance to the antibiotic. Staphylococci made resistant in vitro to 5-methyl-3-phenyl-4-isoxazole penicillin were also resistant to cephalothin and to 6-(2,6-dimethoxybenzamido) penicillin; however, the mechanism of resistance to each antibiotic may have differed. Some complications involved in the laboratory evaluation methods currently in use in the field of antibiotics are examined.
