To explore a possible correlation between susceptibility to Toxoplasma and interferon (IFN)-generating capacity in mice, we compared the levels of serum IFN induced by stimulation with Toxoplasma lysate antigen (TLA) in different strains of Toxoplasma-infected and uninfected mice. Injection of TLA into five strains of mice with chronic Toxoplasma infection resulted in the release of considerable amounts of IFN into the circulation. Most of these IFN activities were acid labile and not neutralized by sheep antiserum against mouse IFN-alpha/beta, indicating that IFN-gamma was the dominant form produced in this system. In contrast, the majority of IFN induced in uninfected mice was characterized as IFN-alpha/beta by their acid stability and antigenicity. The response of IFN production in Toxoplasma-infected and uninfected mice varied quantitatively depending on the mouse strains examined. C57BL/6 mice were found to be the best producers of both IFN-alpha/beta and IFN-gamma, while BALB/c mice were consistently poor producers of both IFN populations. A/J, DBA/2, and C3H/He mice could be roughly classified as intermediate producers of both IFN populations. C57BL/6 and C3H/He mice showed a significant prolongation of mean survival time following primary or secondary infection with Toxoplasma compared to that of BALB/c mice. However, there was no direct correlation between the susceptibility to Toxoplasma and the levels of serum IFN.
