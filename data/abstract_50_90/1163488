Of 420 Staphylococcus aureus isolates, 3.1% were methicillin resistant. Most of the 13 isolates were from the flora of hospitalized patients. The organisms were also resistant to nafcillin and cephalothin. They shared many of the properties with methicillin-resistant staphylococci accumulated from other sources except for the lack of lysozyme-like activity.
