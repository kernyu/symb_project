The proportions of dapsone resistant strains of M. leprae in cases from the field and in patient institutionalized for treatment were compared. Identification of dapsone resistance was done by mouse-foot-pad experiments carried out in the Laboratory in Central Leprosy Teaching and Research Institute, Chengalpattu. A higher percentage of resistance was detected among institutional patients as compared to field cases. The distribution of M.I. ranges of M. leprae in dapsone resistant subjects was not different from that in dapsone sensitive cases.
