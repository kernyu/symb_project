Alteration in transformability of Diplococcus pneumoniae after the acquisition of genetic determinants inducing resistance to erythromycin. J. Bacteriol. 86:735-739. 1963.-The genetic alteration of a highly transformable (competent) recipient strain of Diplococcus pneumoniae by the transformation of at least two of three identified erythromycin-resistance determinants (Ery(a), Ery(b), Ery(c)) results in a marked decrease (Ery(a-b) recombinant) or complete loss (Ery(a-c) recombinant) in the ability to be transformed. The occurrence of transformable cells in cultures of the R6 Ery(a-b) recombinant strains, although greatly diminished, still varies during growth in a manner characteristic of the fully competent parent strain. Both Ery(b) and Ery(c) determinants appear to be linked to Ery(a). In experiments using P(32)-labeled deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), data correlating DNA uptake with transformation show a decrease or loss in uptake capacity of the erythromycin-resistant strains.
