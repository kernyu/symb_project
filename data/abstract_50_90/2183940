One hundred children with peritonitis resulting from a perforated appendix were treated with ceftazidime or netilmicin. Metronidazole was added to both groups to treat the anaerobic organisms commonly associated with the infecting aerobic organisms in peritonitis. Escherichia coli was the most common aerobe found in peritoneal pus. Wound infection occurred in nine patients of the netilmicin group and in none treated with ceftazidime (P less than 0.01). No bacterial resistance was evident in the ceftazidime group, but gram-positive streptococci found in eight patients were resistant to netilmicin. Thus it is recommended that an antibiotic of the penicillin group be added if netilmicin is used to treat peritonitis. The results indicate that ceftazidime was more effective than netilmicin in the treatment of children with peritonitis resulting from a perforated appendix.
