A versatile vector for cloning DNA fragments containing promoter activity in Bacillus subtilis was derived from plasmids pBR322, pUB110 and pC194. Selection is based on chloramphenicol resistance which is dependent upon the introduction of DNA fragments allowing expression of a chloramphenicol acetyl transferase gene. The plasmid contains a second selectable marker, neomycin resistance, and contains functional origins of replication for both B. subtilis and Escherichia coli.
