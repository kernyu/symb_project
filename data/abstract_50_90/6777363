We have studied the mechanisms by which amino acid starvation of Escherichia coli induces resistance against the lytic and bactericidal effects of penicillin. Starvation of E. coli strain W7 of the amino acids lysine or methionine resulted in the rapid development of resistance to autolytic cell wall degradation, which may be effectively triggered in growing bacteria by a number of chemical or physical treatments. The mechanism of this effect in the amino acid-starved cells involved the production of a murein relatively resistant to the hydrolytic action of crude murein hydrolase extracts prepared from normally growing E. coli. Resistance to the autolysins was not due to the covalently linked lipoprotein. Resistance to murein hydrolase developed most rapidly and most extensively in the portion of cell wall synthesized after the onset of amino acid starvation. Lysozymes digests of the autolysin-resistant murein synthesized during the first 10 min of lysine starvation yielded (in addition to the characteristic degradation products) a high-molecular-weight material that was absent from the lysozyme-digests of control cell wall preparations. It is proposed that inhibition of protein synthesis causes a rapid modification of murein structure at the cell wall growth zone in such a manner that attachment of murein hydrolase molecules is inhibited. The mechanism may involve some aspects of the relaxed control system since protection against penicillin-induced lysis developed much slower in amino acid-starved relaxed controlled (relA) cells than in isogenic stringently controlled (relA+) bacteria.
