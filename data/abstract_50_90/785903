Virulent and avirulent cells resistant to streptomycin were revealed in the population of avirulent streptomycin-resistant mutant (obtained from the supressor revertant str-d S. enteritidis mutant) in seeding on a medium with streptomycin. Transduction analysis of the isolated avirulent and virulent strains demonstrated that mutation in the gene-suppressor su-str+ led to the loss of virulence. In connection with the presence in the genom of suppressor revertants of the streptomycin-dependent mutants two mutations (su-su+ and str-d), which irrespective of one another led to the loss of virulence, a conclusion was drawn on the stability of avirulent properties of such strains and on future prospects for their use in the capacity of living vaccines.
