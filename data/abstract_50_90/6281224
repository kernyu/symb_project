A broad host range multiresistance plasmid pPK237, originating from Pseudomonas aeruginosa mediates high-level resistance to gentamicin and tobramycin. It was found to code for two gentamicin modifying enzymes, which from their substrate profile by radioenzymatic assay were characterized as aminoglycoside acetyltransferase AAC(3)-I and aminoglycoside adenylyltransferase AAD(2"). The two enzymes were studied after purification from an Escherichia coli K12 host. The two gentamicin-modifying enzymes coded by PPK237 were completely separated by DEAE chromatography. The purification (126 fold) of the acetyltransferase was achieved by (NH4)2SO4 precipitation, DEAE chromatography and affinity chromatography. The purification of the adenylyltransferase was performed by affinity chromatography directly after (NH4)2SO4 precipitation. Both purified enzyme preparations showed a single protein band on disc electrophoresis. The Km for gentamicin C1 of the acetyltransferase was 0.066 mM. The amino acid analysis of the acetyltransferase coded by pPK237 showed a different aminoacid composition than that of the gentamicin acetyltransferase AAC(3)-I purified by Williams and Northrop17). The acetyltransferase after DEAE chromatography is stable for many months at -20 degrees C, while the adenylyltransferase after purification is highly unstable; it shows enzymatic activity only in the presence of Mg++.
