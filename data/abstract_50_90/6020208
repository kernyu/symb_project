Eight major bacterial groups (25,000 strains) of gram-positive and gram-negative organisms which were isolated from a variety of clinical specimens were tested by the disc-plate and tube dilution procedure. The in vitro antibacterial spectra of 17 commonly used chemotherapeutic agents were recorded and evaluated statistically during a three-year period. Penicillin G, erythromycin and chloramphenicol were very effective against members of the diplococci and streptococci genera. The synthetic penicillins inhibited 99% of Staph. aureus whereas penicillin G was effective against only 45% of these strains. There was a significant increase in the number of tetracycline-resistant strains of both D. pneumoniae and the Lancefield Group A streptococci. A yearly increase in gram-negative pathogens was noted. These organisms (i.e. Escherichia, Aerobacter, Proteus, Pseudomonas) showed greater resistance to the majority of chemotherapeutic agents than did the gram-positive organisms. The percentage of susceptible strains for each bacterial group appears in the text.
