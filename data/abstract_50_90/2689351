Newer beta-lactam antibiotics, notably the third generation cephalosporins (3 GC) have been designed for providing high intrinsic potency against a large variety of microorganisms. Bacterial resistance can occur however, and nowadays, clinicians are concerned by novel situations where even most recently developed compounds can be ineffective. A first situation is generated by bacteria which produce great amounts of chromosomal cephalosporinase. The resistance emerges during therapy, in hospital isolates which are classified as susceptible with conventional susceptibility testing. The prevalence of 3 GC resistance among these gram-negative rods with inducible beta-lactamase seems to increase in some institutions but the significance of susceptibility testing in this regard is doubtful. It is probably more important to note that the prevalence of gram-negative rods with inducible beta-lactamases remains stable. A second problem arose with the abrupt development of plasmid mediated beta-lactamases markedly active against 3 GC. This resistance is underestimated because some strains fall into susceptibility range of 3 GC as determined by MICs or inhibition zone sizes. These extended spectrum enzymes are now distributed over four continents and represent a growing threat.
