Transduction of extrachromosomal markers of resistance to penicillin and erythromycin in staphylococcal strains isolated from patients was studied. Two transduction methods were compared, i. e. transduction with a phage filtrate of the donor culture resistant to erythromycin and transduction on mixed cultivation of the donor and recipient. A higher transduction rate was observed with the latter method. Mixed cultivation of the donor cultures resistant to penicillin or erythromycin and the recipient strains of the wild type sensitive to these antibiotic resulted in transduction of the respective markers. Transductants which acquired prophage 6 simultaneously with marker Egg became donors of erythromycin resistance.
