A total of 33 strains of staphylococci, isolated from Black Pied cows with subclinical mastitis (conformed by the brom-thymol test), were studied to establish their biochemical properties and resistance to antibiotics as well as the occasional correlation between enzyme activity and resistance. It was found that no such dependences existed so far as the biochemical indices of the investigated strains were concerned. All strains proved strongly sensitive to chrolamphenicol, tylan, kanamycin, neomycin, streptomycin, oleandomycin, erythromycin, ampicillin, and were resistant to tetracycline and polymixin. The resistance of staphylococci to antibodies is probably manifested in connection with some of their biochemical properties. It has been found that resistant strains of staphylococci are more active biochemically.
