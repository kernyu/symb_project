Forty one consecutive gonococcal isolates were tested by disc method for their sensitivity to penicillin and seven other antimicrobials. Nineteen (46.34%) strains of N. gonorrhoeae were found to be relatively resistant to penicillin (MIC over 0.25 IU/ml) including 2 (4.88%) strains with complete resistance to penicillin (MIC over 1 IU/ml). None of the gonococcal strains tested was penicillinase-producing (PPNG). A decline in the proportion of sensitive strains of gonococci with a non-significant rise in median value of MIC for penicillin from 2.16 IU/ml in 1980-81 to 2.52 IU/ml in 1986-87 and other antimicrobials was observed.
