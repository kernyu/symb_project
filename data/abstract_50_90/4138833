Resistotyping of P. mirabilis using 10 compounds is reported. The method was tested for reproducibility and specificity and results were compared with those obtained by serological, bacteriophage, and proticine typing methods and the Dienes test. The possible relationship between resistance to the chemicals used in the test and antibiotics was also studied.The method was found to be simple, reproducible, show good specificity, and compare favourably with other typing methods. No linkage between resistance to the chemicals and antibiotic resistance was detected.
