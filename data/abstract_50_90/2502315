WEHI164 cells are susceptible to cytotoxicity by soluble recombinant or monocyte-derived TNF alpha, as well as to cell-mediated cytotoxicity by monocytes or lymphocytes. In contrast, K562 cells are resistant to lysis by soluble recombinant or natural TNF alpha, but are killed by monocyte or lymphocyte effector cells. Cell-mediated cytotoxicity against both target cell lines is enhanced by treatment of monocyte effector cells with recombinant interferon gamma or lymphocyte effector cells with interleukin-2. However, treatment of monocytes with LPS, or of lymphocytes with PHA, although inducing secretion of soluble TNF alpha in the medium, does not increase cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Anti-TNF alpha neutralizing antibodies partially inhibit monocyte- as well as lymphocyte-mediated cytotoxicity against WEHI164 and K562 cells. Formaldehyde-fixed effector cells are cytotoxic to both target cell lines. Cytotoxicity by fixed effector cells can be inhibited by anti-TNF alpha antibodies. The extent of cell-mediated cytotoxicity induced by treatment of effector cells with stimulators prior to fixation corresponds to the expression of TNF on monocyte membranes, but not to the titers of secreted TNF. The data suggest that membrane-associated TNF alpha may be a mechanism of human monocyte- as well as lymphocyte-mediated cytotoxicity, regardless of whether the target cells are sensitive or insensitive to soluble TNF.
