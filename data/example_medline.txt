TI  - Mutants of ubiquinol-cytochrome c2 oxidoreductase resistant to Qo site
      inhibitors: consequences for ubiquinone and ubiquinol affinity and catalysis.
PG  - 11249-60
AB  - Seven single-site mutants in six residues of the cyt b polypeptide of Rhodobacter
      capsulatus selected for resistance to the Qo site inhibitors stigmatellin,
      myxothiazol, or mucidin [Daldal, F., Tokito, M.K., Davidson, E., & Faham, M.
      (1989) EMBO J. 8, 3951-3961] have been characterized by using optical and EPR
      spectroscopy and single-turnover kinetic analysis. The strains were compared with
      wild-type strain MT1131 and with the Ps- strain R126 (G158D), which is
      dysfunctional in its Qo site [Robertson, D.E., Davidson, E., Prince, R.C., van
      den Berg, W.H., Marrs, B.L., & Dutton, P.L. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 584-591]. 
      Mutants selected for stigmatellin resistance induced a weakening in the binding
      of the inhibitor without discernible loss of ubiquinone(Q)/ubiquinol(QH2) binding
      affinity to the Qo site or kinetic impairment to catalysis. Mutants selected for 
      myxothiazol or mucidin resistance, inducing weakening of inhibitor binding, all
      displayed impaired rates of Qo site catalysis: The most severe cases (F144L,
      F144S) displayed loss of affinity for Q, and evidence suggests that parallel loss
      of affinity for the substrate QH2 was incurred in these strains. The results
      provide a view of the nature of the interaction of Q and QH2 of the Qpool with
      the Qo site. Consideration of the mutational substitutions and their structural
      positions along with comparisons with the QA and QB sites of the photosynthetic
      reaction center suggests a model for the structure of the Qo site.
