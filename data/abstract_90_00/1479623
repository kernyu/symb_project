We employed an isolated guinea-pig heart model perfused at constant pressure (70 cmH2O) to test the hypothesis that inhibition of adenosine metabolism increases interstitial adenosine concentrations (as measured with epicardial discs) and coronary flow. Iodotubercidin (ITU, 1 microM) and EHNA (erythro-9-[2-hydroxy-3-nonyl] adenine, 5 microM) were used to inhibit adenosine kinase and deaminase, respectively during control conditions and during metabolic stimulation with 1 microM isoproterenol. The adenosine receptor blocker 8-phenyltheophylline (8-PT) was used during control conditions to assess whether the response seen was adenosine specific. ITU plus EHNA decreased heart rate (202 +/- 10 to 136 +/- 11 beats/min) and increased coronary flow (8.2 +/- 0.3 to 12.4 +/- 0.9 ml/min/g) without a change in MVO2, developed pressure or dP/dt. ITU plus EHNA increased adenosine concentrations in epicardial fluid (0.24 +/- 0.07 microM to 1.02 +/- 0.09 microM) and venous effluent (40 +/- 3 nM to 262 +/- 32 nM) during control conditions, and adenosine release increased from 389 +/- 96 pmols/min/g to 3480 +/- 365 pmols/min/g. 8-PT infusion reversed the effects on heart rate and coronary flow and resulted in a persistent elevation of epicardial fluid adenosine concentrations. During metabolic stimulation with 1 microM isoproterenol, ITU plus EHNA significantly limited the increase in heart rate and ventricular developed pressure and dP/dt while coronary flow increased to a significantly greater extent. Myocardial oxygen consumption was similar during metabolic stimulation between the two groups (vehicle vs. ITU plus EHNA). Epicardial fluid adenosine concentration in the vehicle-treated group increased from 0.17 +/- 0.3 microM to 0.34 +/- 0.02 microM at 15 min of isoproterenol stimulation whereas it increased from 1.10 +/- 0.02 microM to 2.90 +/- 0.46 microM in the ITU plus EHNA-treated group. Inhibition of adenosine metabolism during metabolic stimulation significantly increased venous adenosine concentrations and adenosine release and reduced inosine and hypoxanthine release proportionately. The release of adenosine+inosine+hypoxanthine was unchanged. Inhibition of adenosine metabolism provides evidence supporting the hypothesis that adenosine plays a role in regulating coronary vascular resistance as well as influencing heart rate and ventricular inotropy.
