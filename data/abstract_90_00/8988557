Several compounds (n = 13 single or combinations; most at therapeutic dosages) were evaluated between 1977 and 1992 in critical tests (n = 91) against benzimidazole (BZ) resistant small strongyles (Population S) and several other species of internal parasites in Shetland ponies, mostly under 1 year old. The closed breeding herd, from which the test ponies were selected, had been treated every 8 weeks with cambendazole (CBZ) for 4 years (1974-1978) and oxibendazole (OBZ) for 14 years (1978-1992). Published field test data (1974-1992) on older ponies in the herd showed BZ resistance of small strongyles. Average efficacies in the present critical tests against small strongyles for OBZ (n = 59 animals) were high in early years (95% or higher), but gradually declined to a low of 1% in 1991. Side-resistance of small strongyles was evident in critical tests (n = 1-6/single drug or combination) for several other BZs and a pro-BZ; ivermectin and piperazine were highly active, but pyrantel pamoate exhibited weak activity. BZ resistance was evident for six small strongyle species (Cyathostomum catinatum, Cyathostomum coronatum, Cylicocylus nassatus, Cylicostephanus calicatus, Cylicostephanus goldi, and Cylicostephanus longibursatus). Activity on bots, ascarids, large strongyles, and pinworms was essentially as expected, indicating no drug resistance.
