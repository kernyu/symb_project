To evaluate the respective interest of amikacin and isepamicin in P. aeruginosa infection, the resistance level was ascertained using the disk method. Susceptibility was also tested for gentamicin, tobramycin and netilmicin. Isolates came from three surgical units and from two intensive care units. Serotyping was proceeded, and isolates coming from the same patient, with the same susceptibility pattern and the same serotype was included once only: 197 strains were thus obtained. Resistance level was 22.3% for amikacin, and 28.4% for isepamicin. Discrepancies were found in 14.7% of cases (major: 8.1%; minor: 6.6%). Discordant strains were more susceptible to amikacin than to isepamicin in 30/37 cases, and more susceptible to isepamicin in 7/37 cases. This difference was highly significant (paired Chi-2 test: p < 10(-4). The best susceptibility to amikacin was found in all serotypes and units.
