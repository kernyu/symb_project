The sensitivity of 11 Mycoplasma and 5 Acholeplasma species to the bacteriocin nisin was determined. When applied on filter paper discs to lawns of acholeplasma cells, nisin (20 nmol per disc) gave 3.5- to 7.0-mm zones of growth inhibition. The inclusion of 0.2 mM nisin in agar medium reduced the number of Acholeplasma laidlawii colonies by a factor of more than 10(6), and in a salts solution, 75 microM nisin killed more than 99.9% of cells within 1 min. Under similar conditions, nisin had no significant effect upon the growth or survival of Mycoplasma species. At low concentrations (1 to 3 microM), nisin stimulated glucose oxidation by A. laidlawii and Acholeplasma oculi. However, in comparison with carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP), a recognized protonophore and uncoupler of respiration, the maximum extent of stimulation was low, < or = 20%, compared with up to 180% for CCCP. Also, in contrast to results obtained with CCCP, at concentrations only slightly above those causing stimulation of acholeplasma oxygen uptake, nisin strongly inhibited respiration. Inhibition of oxygen uptake was greater for A. laidlawii cells grown in the absence of cholesterol, and on agar medium, growth inhibition by nisin decreased with increasing concentrations of cholesterol. Nisin resistance may be a valuable characteristic in the selection and identification of Mycoplasma spp.
