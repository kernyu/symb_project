To assess the organization of the Thermus thermophilus ribosomal protein genes, a fragment of DNA containing the complete S10 region and ten ribosomal protein genes of the spc region was cloned, using an oligonucleotide coding for the N-terminal amino acid (aa) sequence of T. thermophilus S8 protein as hybridization probe. The nucleotide sequence of a 4290 bp region between the rps17 and rpl15 genes was determined. Comparative analysis of this gene cluster showed that the gene arrangement (S17, L14, L24, L5, S14, S8, L6, L18, S5, L30 and L15) is identical to that of eubacteria. However, T. thermophilus ribosomal protein genes corresponding to the Escherichia coli S10 and spc operons are not resolved into two clusters: the stop codon of the rps17 gene (the last gene of the S10 operon in E. coli) and the start codon of the rpl14 gene (the first gene of the spc operon in E. coli) overlap. Most genes, except the rps14-rps8 intergenic spacer (69 bp), are separated by very short (only 3-7 bp) spacer regions or partially overlapped. The deduced aa sequences of T. thermophilus proteins share about 51-100% identities with the sequences of homologous proteins from thermophile Thermus aquaticus and Thermotoga maritima and 27-70% identities with the sequences of their mesophile counterparts.
