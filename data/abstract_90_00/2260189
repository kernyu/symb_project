13 isolates of Trichophyton violaceum and 7 Microsporum langeroni from Zambia and Cameroon were tested in vitro for their sensitivity to griseofulvin. No strain was found resistant. All the 13 T. violaceum were inhibited by 4-8 micrograms/ml while 4 M. langeroni were inhibited by 0.5-1 microgram/ml.
