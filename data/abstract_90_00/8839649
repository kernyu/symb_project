Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-A. baumannii complex species have emerged as a relevant cause of nosocomial infection and colonization over the past 20 years, mainly in intensive care units. The aim of this study was to investigate the in vitro activity of 14 antimicrobial agents against 177 clinical isolates from patients admitted to a Spanish teaching hospital over a five-year period. Susceptibility rates or 99%, 99%, and 74% were obtained for imipenem, meropenem, ampicillin plus sulbactam, and amikacin, respectively. Increases in resistance were detected mainly for ticarcillin, piperacillin plus tazobactam, ceftazidime, amikacin, and ofloxacin. These results indicate that treatment of nosocomial infections due to Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-A. baumannii complex strains may be difficult.
