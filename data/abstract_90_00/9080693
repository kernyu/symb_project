The MAR indexes of hospital isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were determined with reference to nine different cephalosporins. The values for all the strains were higher than 0.2 suggesting their origin from a high risk source of contamination where antibiotics are often used. Emergence of MAR pathogenic strains of Ps. aeruginosa indicated possible nosocomial infection in the hospital environment. beta-Lactamases produced by these organisms were tested and their inhibition by clavulanic acid was studied. beta-Lactamase produced by one of these strains (Ps-1) could not be inhibited by clavulanic acid whereas beta-lactamases of three other strains (Ps-2, Ps-3 and Ps-4) could be inhibited by clavulanic acid in the presence of cephalosporins, suggesting a possible use of clavulanic acid in combination with cephalosporins, to combat beta-lactamase induced resistance in Ps. aeruginosa.
