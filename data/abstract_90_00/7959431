Fourteen synthetically prepared 1-(1,2,4-triazol-1-yl)acetanilides were tested for antimicrobial effect. None of the prepared derivatives influenced the B. subtilis, P. fluorescens nor the tested yeasts. Only the derivatives with substituents in positions para or ortho and para were biologically effective. The widest antimicrobial spectrum was manifested by the pentachloro derivative, which was effective with G+ and G- bacteria and with filamentous fungi.
