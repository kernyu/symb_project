Susceptibility to eight commonly used antimicrobial agents and plasmid profile analysis was done on forty one Escherichia coli strains isolated from milk. Most (95%) of the strains were resistant to sulphamethoxazole with a relatively low rate of resistance to the other antimicrobial agents. Twenty nine per cent of the isolates showed multiple resistance. The number of plasmids carried per strain was between 1 and 5, while plasmid sizes ranged between 107 and 1.0 megadaltons (MDa). There was no relationship between carriage of plasmids and antimicrobial resistance patterns.
