The use of cyclosporine in solid organ transplantation has been shown to be associated with the development of hypertension and nephrotoxicity. Several mechanisms, including endothelin-mediated systemic vasoconstriction, impaired vasodilatation secondary to reduction in nitric oxide, and altered cytosolic calcium translocation, have been proposed to underlie cyclosporine-induced hypertension. In addition, other studies have shown activation of the sympathetic nervous system and the renin-angiotensin system, as well as abnormalities in prostaglandin metabolism, as culpable mechanisms. Hemodynamic features of cyclosporine-induced hypertension consist of elevated peripheral vascular resistance, ventricular vascular uncoupling contributing to left ventricular hypertrophy, and abnormalities in the diastolic function of the allograft. Combined calcium-channel blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have been used for this treatment of this clinical problem, and they achieve blood pressure control in 65% of patients. Moreover, these agents may also be beneficial in preventing development of cardiac allograft vasculopathy, a long-term nemesis in cardiac transplantation.
