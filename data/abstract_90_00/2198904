UGA-specific nonsense suppressors from Escherichia coli K-12 were isolated and characterized. One of them (Su+UGA-11) was identified as a mutant of the prfB gene for the peptide releasing factor RF2. It appears that in this strain, while peptide release at sites of UGA mutations is retarded, the UGA stop codon is read through even in the absence of a tRNA suppressor, exhibiting a novel type of passive nonsense suppression. Three suppressors (Su+UGA-12, -16 and -34) were capable of restoring the streptomycin sensitive phenotype in resistant bacteria (strAr). Because of their drug-related phenotype, these are possibly mutations in the components of the ribosomal machinery, particularly those concerned with peptide release at UGA nonsense codons. A tRNA suppressor was also obtained which was derived from the tRNA(Trp) gene. In this strain, a long region between rrnC (84.5 min) and rrnB (89.5 min) was duplicated and one of the duplicated genes of tRNA(Trp) was mutated to the suppressor. The mechanism of UGA-suppression is discussed in terms of translation termination at the nonsense codon in both active and passive fashions.
