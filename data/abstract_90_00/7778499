The effect of ketoconazole (KK) on chosen biochemical indexes was studied in three mutants of dermatophyte Microsporum gypseum (MG-155 wild strain) resistant to KK. Fungistatic concentration of KK added to liquid cultivate medium increases significantly ergosterol pool and nonsignificantly demethylation activity, potassium content, cAMP release in three days old mycelium of mutants when compared to the cultivation without KK. On the contrary, there is a significant suppression of ergosterol level and demethylation activity followed by highly significant increasing of potassium content and cAMP release in the case of wild strain MG-155.
