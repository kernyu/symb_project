Blasticidin S (BS), a fungicide of microbial origin, is used for the practical control of rice blast disease. It has broad antimicrobial activity but occasionally exhibits adverse phytotoxic effects on some dicot plants. An inactivating enzyme, BS deaminase, was discovered in the BS resistant strain, Bacillus cereus K55-S1, and the structural gene, bsr, for the enzyme has been cloned. We introduced the bsr gene into tobacco plants using the Ti plasmid vector system and demonstrated that the bsr gene conferred a BS resistant phenotype to the plants. Thus the bsr gene could be useful as a selective marker for plant transformation and provides an example for a new approach to the solution of phytotoxicity problems associated with the use of some types of fungicide.
