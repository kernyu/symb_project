The rates of resistance to commonly used antimicrobial agents have been documented to be at alarmingly high levels in Taiwan for both Gram-positive and Gram-negative species. This study was conducted to assess the current resistance patterns in six medical centers strictly controlled using a common MIC methodology and quality assurance measures. Cefepime, a new clinically introduced broad-spectrum "fourth-generation" cephalosporin, was compared to other members in this class including ceftazidime, cefpirome, ceftriaxone, piperacillin/tazobactam, and imipenem. These antimicrobials were tested against ten species groups of common clinical isolates of Enterobacteriaceae, non-enteric Gram-negative bacilli, and oxacillin-susceptible Staphylococcus spp. The results confirmed that extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) production in Klebsiella spp. (21.7%) and Escherichia coli (16.7%) was common in all medical centers surveyed. Cefepime was more active against these two species as well as against Amp C producing species, indole-positive Proteae, and Acinetobacter species. The activity of cefepime was comparable although slightly less than that of ceftazidime against Serratia spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains. All or nearly all staphylococci isolates were susceptible to the beta-lactam antimicrobial agents, except for ceftazidime. Overall, these antimicrobial agents had descending spectrums of activity as follows: imipenem > cefepime > cefpirome > piperacillin/tazobactam > ceftazidime > ceftriaxone for the 550 isolates tested. Cefepime seems to be an important broad-spectrum beta-lactam that can be used with confidence against many important pathogens in Taiwan, including those harboring resistance mechanisms. A continued surveillance program seems prudent for this geographic area.
