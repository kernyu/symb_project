Plasmid incompatibility studies have demonstrated that strains of Salmonella enteritidis phage type (PT) 6a resistant to ampicillin possess a 36 megadalton incompatibility group (Inc) X plasmid coding for resistance to ampicillin which is capable of converting strains of Salm. enteritidis belonging to PTs 1 and 4 to PT 6a, and PT 8 to PT 13. However, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) has demonstrated that all clinical isolates of PT 6a have a characteristic XbaI pulsed-field profile which is distinct from that of PT 1 and which can only be differentiated from that of PT 4 by the presence of plasmid-associated fragments of less than 45 kb. It is concluded that ampicillin-resistant strains of Salm. enteritidis PT 6a are derived from strains of Salm. enteritidis PT 4 by acquisition of an Inc X ampicillin resistance plasmid.
