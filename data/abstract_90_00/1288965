The effects of netilmicin exposure on two aminoglycoside (AMG)-resistant and two AMG-susceptible Enterobacter cloacae isolates were studied. It was found that 1 h incubation of bacterial suspensions with netilmicin at 16 mg/l reduces the amounts of lipopolysaccharides present on the bacterial surface. Also, netilmicin pretreatment increased both the susceptibility to normal human serum and the adhesion to human epithelial cells of all four E. cloacae strains examined.
