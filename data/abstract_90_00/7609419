Spiramycin activity against acute pneumonia has been studied in 21 outpatients (15 adults and 6 children). The drug was administered orally twice daily in a dose 3,000,000 units. The course lasted from 7 to 14 days. All the cases were confirmed roentgenologically. The disease ran a moderate-severity course. The response rate reached 95.2%. Another course of antibiotic therapy was not needed. Side effects were not registered. Bacteriological efficacy of spiramycin made up 71.3%. 14 out of 16 isolated strains of causative agents (S.pneumoniae, S.pyogenes, S.aureus, H.influenzae in 5, 1, 7 and 3 patients, respectively) proved sensitive to spiramycin. 2 patients developed mycoplasma infection diagnosed serologically. The findings confirm high therapeutic efficacy of spiramycin, its good tolerance. Spiramycin may be considered the drug of the priority choice in outpatient treatment of acute pneumonia.
