In 1995-1999, 67 patients with relapsed Hodgkin's disease or refractory to chemotherapy (group A--first relapse, B--primary refractory disease, and C--repeated relapse) received cytoreductive (dexaBEAM, DHAP) therapy followed by high-dose BEAM chemotherapy and autologous bone marrow or blood cell transplantation. Early postoperative transplant-related mortality rate was 4.5%. At day 100, complete remission rates were: group A--95.6%; B--74.1%; and C--76.5%. Survival for all patients was: overall--61.9%; event-free--43.9%; disease-free--46%; and relapse-free survival--49.5%. Such factors as primary refractory disease, age over 30 years and response to cytoreductive therapy had significant influence on overall survival prognosis.
