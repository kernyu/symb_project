Overuse of antifungal agents has resulted in the selection of naturally resistant Candida species, as well as expression of resistance from previously susceptible species resulting from genetic mutations and/or selection of resistant subpopulations. Strategies for the appropriate use of antifungal agents need to be developed to prevent further development of resistance.
