Novel aryl phosphate derivatives of the anti-HIV nucleoside analogue AZT have been prepared by phosphorochloridate chemistry. These materials are designed to act as membrane-soluble pro-drugs of the bio-active free nucleotides. In vitro evaluation revealed the compounds to have a pronounced, selective antiviral activity, which, in one case, was more potent than the parent nucleoside AZT. The magnitude of the biological effect varied considerably with the nature of the phosphate-blocking group. Moreover, one of the compounds, a phosphoramidate, is particularly active in a cell line restrictive to the activity of AZT, due to poor phosphorylation therein. These data support the suggestion that the phosphate derivatives exert their biological effects via intracellular release of the nucleotide forms.
