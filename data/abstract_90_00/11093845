BACKGROUND: To analyze the frequency of HIV primary mutations to nucleosides analogues in Andalusia. PATIENTS AND METHOD: Genotype study (LiPA) of mutations in codons M41L, T69D, K70R, L74V, M184V, T215Y/F and RT75G-S was performed in 106 HIV-naive patients from 12 Andalusian hospitals, with viral load over 5000 copies of RNA/ml. RESULTS: Reliable results were obtained in 96 patients; 11 of them (11.45%) showed 12 mutations: two in codon 41, four in codon 70, three in codon 184 and three in codon 215. One patient showed two mutations (41 and 215). The presence of mutations only was related to having sex partner and sexual transmission of HIV infection. CONCLUSIONS: a) The primary mutations to nucleosides in HIV patients from Andalusia was 11.45%; b) mainly involved drugs were AZT and 3Tc, and c) mutations regarding resistance to ddC, ddI o D4T were not found.
