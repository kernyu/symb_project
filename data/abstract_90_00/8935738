Antibiotic-resistant bacteria pose an ever-increasing therapeutic problem. The ways whereby bacteria circumvent drug action are many and varied, ranging from intrinsic impermeability to acquired resistance (involving plasmids, transposons and mutations). Antibiotics may be unable to reach susceptible target sites, they may be enzymatically inactivated, modified or expelled or mutations may arise such as to render the target sites insusceptible. Mechanisms of bacterial resistance to biocides are less well understood but cellular impermeability is a major factor. Plasmid-mediated efflux of cationic antiseptics in antibiotic-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains has been demonstrated but its role in the resistance of these organisms to the biocide concentrations used in clinical practice is unclear. An association between resistance to antibiotics and biocides in Gram-negative bacteria has also been observed but it is often difficult at present to reach definite conclusions about genetic linkages between antibiotic resistance and biocide resistance.
