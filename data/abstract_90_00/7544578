CD95 (Fas/APO-1) is a cytokine receptor protein that signals apoptosis. Here we report that human retinal pigment epithelial cells express CD95 but are rather resistant to agonistic CD95 antibodies. Resistance to CD95 antibodies is overcome by preexposure to the cytokines, tumor necrosis factor-alpha or interferon-gamma, or by coexposure to CD95 antibodies and inhibitors of RNA or protein synthesis. The cells are resistant to tumor necrosis factor-alpha even in the presence of cycloheximide and only moderately sensitized to tumor necrosis factor-alpha-mediated toxicity by coexposure to actinomycin D. CD95-mediated apoptosis is inhibited by dexamethasone both after cytokine sensitization and upon coexposure to CD95 antibodies and actinomycin D or cycloheximide. Induction of apoptosis via CD95 may be involved in the regulation of retinal pigment epithelial proliferation at the vitreoretinal interface.
