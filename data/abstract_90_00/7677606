The sensitivity to apo-lactoferrin (apo-LF) of two oral isolates each of Candida albicans and C. krusei preincubated in either sucrose- or tunicamycin-supplemented media was investigated. Known apo-LF-sensitive isolates of both C. albicans and C. krusei demonstrated significantly increased resistance to apo-LF when preincubated in sucrose-supplemented media, but such preincubation had no effect on an apo-LF-resistant isolate of C. albicans, irrespective of the sugar concentration in the medium. Surprisingly, an apo-LF-resistant isolate of C. krusei demonstrated increased susceptibility to apo-LF when preincubated in sucrose. Further, when preincubated with tunicamycin, a chemical that interferes with candidal cell-wall formation, the susceptibility to apo-LF of the resistant isolates increased significantly. These results, when extrapolated in vivo, imply that dietary sucrose may diminish the anticandidal potency of salivary lactoferrin. However, the aberrant behaviour of a single isolate of C. krusei under these circumstances is possibly due to the different cell-wall structure of this yeast and needs to be further investigated.
