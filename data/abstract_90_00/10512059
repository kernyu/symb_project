SCH-27899 is an investigational antibiotic from the everninomicin family, a group of oligosaccharide antibiotics produced by Micromonospora carbonacea. Information regarding the pharmacology, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and toxicity of this agent was obtained from a MEDLINE search and a review of abstracts presented at recent scientific meetings. SCH-27899 has in vitro bacteriostatic activity against a wide variety of gram-positive organisms, including highly resistant organisms such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-intermediate-sensitivity S. aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae (both penicillin-susceptible and -nonsusceptible), and vancomycin-resistant enterococci. In vitro data, animal studies, and preliminary human studies indicate that it is effective and fairly well tolerated. Its place in therapy remains to be determined, and clinical trials continue.
