In order to understand the role of trovafloxacin in the treatment of nosocomial pneumonia, the nature and characteristics of this infection have to be first reviewed. During the first part of this revision the principal aspects of the epidemiology are reviewed, some concepts which take part in the pathogenia of the illness and the immunology of these patients are analysed and the microbiological characteristics of nosocomial pneumonia are evaluated. In the second part of the revision the bacterial resistance to the main groups of antibiotics is considered, listing the different mechanisms used by the bacteria to develop this resistance. They are: production of enzymes which inactivate the antibiotic, access reduction of the drug to the target site, increase of the antibiotic efflux or changes in the target site. Current controversies concerning diagnostic methods and some controversial issues regarding this pathology are here discussed. Finally, the proposed guidelines for the treating hospital acquired pneumonia are revised as well as the role of special new antibiotics. In this sense special reference is made to trovafloxacin, listing its principal characteristics, as its broad spectrum of activity, its excellent pharmacokinetic properties, its availability in i.v. and oral formulations and its good tolerance, which makes trovafloxacin a very interesting option for treatment of hospital acquired pneumonia.
