Since the first outbreak in 1990, the incidence of Salmonella ser. Enteritidis (S. Enteritidis) phage type (PT) 1 food poisoning has gradually increased in Tokyo and has reached approximately 30% of the total S. Enteritidis outbreaks reported. To characterise these S. Enteritidis PT1 food poisoning, a total of 198 strains obtained from 44 outbreaks between 1990 and 1996 were examined for antimicrobial resistance, acid producibility from glycols (propylene and ethylene glycol) and plasmid DNA profiles. The 44 PT1 outbreaks analysed were further subdivided into 11 types by epidemiological markers. The most common patterns were type A (plasmid profile carrying only one plasmid (60 kb). SM and TC resistance and non producibility from glycols), and type B (plasmid profile carrying two plasmids (60 and 20 kb), SM resistance and no producibility from glycols) and were responsible for 21 (47.7%) and 15 (34.1%) outbreaks, respectively. In 11 of 44 outbreaks, strains carrying identical epidemiological markers were isolated both from patients and vehicle foods, environments, and/or food-handlers. Similar to PT4 and PT34 outbreaks reported in Japan, egg and egg-related foods were also suspected in 8 of these 11 outbreaks. Of interest, chicken which were not pointed out in PT4 and PT 34 outbreaks was also suspected as a vehicle of transmission in two outbreaks.
