The two pneumococcal autolytic enzymes (an N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase and an endo-beta-1,4-N-acetylglucosaminidase) are directly involved in the penicillin-induced killing of Streptococcus pneumoniae. The activity of these lytic enzymes was efficiently controlled in tolerant mutants under physiological conditions.
