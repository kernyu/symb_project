Cefpirome (CPR, HR 810) was given intravenously to 10 children with acute bacterial infections including 8 with acute pneumonia, 1 each with acute pleuritis and urinary tract infections. Good to excellent clinical responses were obtained in all of the 10 patients and bacterial eradication were obtained for all 8 strains found in these cases. Slight elevation of GOT, GPT and eosinophilia were observed in 1 case each. From the above clinical results, it appears that CPR is a useful antibiotic for treatment of pediatric patients with various bacterial infections.
