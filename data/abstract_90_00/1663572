P. aeruginosa is highly resistant to a wide range of antimicrobial agents. This intrinsic resistance mainly depends on the rate of permeation across the outer membrane (o.m.). In order to promote antibiotic uptake across the hydrophilic channel of the o.m. porins, a permeator can be used with a hydrophilic antibiotic. In the present study we assess the o.m. electrophoretic profile of three P. aeruginosa strains cultured with and without antibiotic Aztreonam and Netilmicin (A:N) using the MIC concentration in the association (3:1). The observed increase in the band can be referred to the F porin when the strains are treated with Aztreonam.
