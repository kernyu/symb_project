The objective of the present study was to analyze the susceptibility profiles of 911 clinical strains of the Bacteroides fragilis group isolated from 1992 to 1997 in our institution in order to monitor susceptibility changes over time. Whereas the rates of resistance to metronidazole, imipenem, piperacillin-tazobactam, ticarcillin-clavulanic acid, penicillin, piperacillin, and cefoxitin remained essentially unchanged, there was a significant increase in the rates of resistance to clindamycin, which rose from 8.2% in 1992 to 19.7% in 1997 (P < 0.0004).
