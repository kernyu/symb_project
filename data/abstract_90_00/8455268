Use of the immunosuppressive agent cyclosporine A (CyA) is limited by its associated nephrotoxicity, characterized by an increase in renal vascular resistance (RVR) and reductions in renal blood flow (RBF) and glomerular filtration rate (GFR). The vascular endothelium produces vasoactive substances including endothelium derived relaxation factor (EDRF) and endothelin (ET), which modulate vascular tone. Since CyA has been shown to damage the endothelium, we examined the renal hemodynamic response to intrarenal ET infusion (4 micrograms./kg./minute) in chronic cyclosporine-treated dogs. Prior to ET infusion, CyA-treated dogs had a lower RBF and a greater RVR than normal dogs. In normal dogs, after ET infusion RVR increased from 30.24 +/- 0.64 to 44.60 +/- 1.66 mmHg./ml./minute (p < 0.001), RBF decreased from 4.26 +/- 0.28 to 2.90 +/- 0.30 ml./min./g. (p < 0.001) and GFR decreased from 50.20 +/- 5.90 to 36.50 +/- 7.90 ml. per minute (p < 0.001). In contrast, there was no change in RBF, GFR and RVR after intrarenal ET infusion in CyA-treated dogs. Prior to ET infusion, arterial plasma ET concentration was 5.0 +/- 1.1 pg./ml. in CyA-treated dogs, similar to 7.5 +/- 1.4 pg./ml. in normal dogs, and was not significantly altered in either group after intrarenal ET infusion. We conclude that ET may not contribute to the increased RVR in chronic cyclosporine nephrotoxicity, and suggest a vascular toxicity of CyA, rendering renal vessels unresponsive to the vasoconstrictive effect of ET.
