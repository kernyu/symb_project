Recent data indicate that cells may acquire thermotolerance via more than one route. In this study, we observed differences in thermotolerance development in HeLa S3 cells induced by prior heating (15 minutes at 44 degrees C) or pretreatment with sodium-arsenite (1 hour at 37 degrees C, 100 microM). Inhibition of overall protein and heat shock protein (HSP) synthesis (greater than 95%) by cycloheximide (25 micrograms/ml) during tolerance development nearly completely abolished thermotolerance induced by arsenite, while significant levels of heat-induced thermotolerance were still apparent. The same dependence of protein synthesis was found for resistance against sodium-arsenite toxicity. Toxic heat, but not toxic arsenite treatments caused heat damage in the cell nucleus, measured as an increase in the protein mass of nuclei isolated from treated cells (intranuclear protein aggregation). Recovery from this intranuclear protein aggregation was observed during post-heat incubations of the cells at 37 degrees C. The rate of recovery was faster in heat-induced tolerant cells than in nontolerant cells. Arsenite-induced tolerant cells did not show an enhanced rate of recovery from the heat-induced intranuclear protein aggregation. In parallel, hyperthermic inhibition of RNA synthesis was the same in tolerant and nontolerant cells, whereas post-heat recovery was enhanced in heat-induced, but not arsenite-induced thermotolerant cells. The more rapid recovery from heat damage in the nucleus (protein aggregation and RNA synthesis) in cells made tolerant by a prior heat treatment seemed related to the ability of heat (but not arsenite) to induce HSP translocations to the nucleus.
