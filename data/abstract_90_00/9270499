We review the newer antimicrobial agents that are being employed by dermatologists with increased frequency as well as some of the more commonly used older agents. Particular emphasis is based on selection factors such as causative pathogens and their resistance profiles, routes of administration, toxicity, drug interactions, and dosing requirements. Emphasis in this review is on the newer classes of antimicrobials such as third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins; beta-lactam, beta-lactamase inhibitor combination agents; monobactams; carbapenems; macrolides; and fluoroquinolones. Dermatologic indications and treatment alternatives are highlighted; this will expand the practicing clinician's therapeutic armamentarium and enable him/her to make rational decisions concerning treatment approaches to infectious disease problems encountered in daily practice.
