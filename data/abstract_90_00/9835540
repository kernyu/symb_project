The new fluoroquinolone trovafloxacin was tested against a ciprofloxacin-sensitive, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strain in the rabbit model of endocarditis. Trovafloxacin was more effective than vancomycin (CFU/g of vegetation, 2.65 +/- 1.87 versus 4.54 +/- 2.80 [mean +/- standard deviation]; P < 0.05) or ampicillin-sulbactam plus rifampin (4.9 +/- 1.1 CFU/g). The addition of ampicillin-sulbactam to trovafloxacin tended to reduce titers further.
