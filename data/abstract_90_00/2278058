The activities of artemisinin (qinghaosu), dihydroartemisinin (dihydroqinghaosu), artemether and pyronaridine were tested in a 48 h in vitro assay against 3 chloroquine-sensitive and one chloroquine-resistant strains of Plasmodium falciparum. Growth inhibition was modelled with a sigmoid Emax model. All compounds markedly inhibited the growth of all strains although, for the chloroquine-resistant strain, merozoites were detected at concentrations as high as 10(-4) M of artemisinin, dihydroartemisinin and artemether. Dihydroartemisinin, artemether and pyronaridine appeared to be more potent than artemisinin, with EC50 values of 4.7-23 nM, 0.98-6.1 nM and 4.4-18 nM respectively, while the EC50 value of artemisinin was 3-108 nM against all 4 strains.
