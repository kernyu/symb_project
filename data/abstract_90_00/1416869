Ampicillin-resistant strains of Salmonella other than S. typhi constitute a health problem. We tested the antimicrobial susceptibilities to 10 antibiotics of 57 of these strains isolated in a 30-month period. The rates of resistance were as follows: chloramphenicol, 40.3%; tetracycline, 33.3%; gentamicin, 5.3%; co-trimoxazole, 5.3%; nalidixic acid, 1.8%; and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, aztreonam, and ciprofloxacin, 0%. In our experience, there are alternative antibiotics with excellent in vitro activities.
