HIV results in a continual and progressive pathological attack on the human immune system. This attack on the immune system can be altered with combination antiretroviral agents that interrupt the HIV life-cycle. There are three classes of approved antiretroviral agents: nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, and protease inhibitors. The progressive deterioration of the patient's immune system by HIV infection increases the likelihood of developing opportunistic infections. Primary measures that can be taken to prevent the development of opportunistic infections are preventing exposure to the microorganisms in the environment and maintaining a competent immune system using antiretroviral therapy through prophylactic agents specific to opportunistic infections.
