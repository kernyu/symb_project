1. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) are gram-positive cocci, differing from methicillin-resistant species of S epidermidis because they produce coagulase. MRSA is distinguished from methicillin-sensitive S aureus by its resistance to methicillin and other antibiotics. MRSA has not been found to be an organism of greater virulence than methicillin-sensitive strains of S aureus, but infections caused by MRSA are sometimes of greater concern because of the limited antibiotic treatment options. 2. In the past 25 years there has been an increase in the number of reported infections in patients caused by MRSA. As infections with MRSA have become more prevalent in community hospitals throughout the country, the difficulty in controlling the spread within the community hospitals has mirrored the experiences of the tertiary care centers. 3. Education regarding the transmission of microorganisms and the caregiver's role in prevention is essential for every nursing facility. Interfacility communication is essential for hospital and nursing home staff to plan and manage the care of infected or colonized residents. 4. A facility-specific MRSA policy should optimize the opportunity for infected persons to receive nursing home care--without jeopardizing other residents.
