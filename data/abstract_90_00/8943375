Successful control of infectious disease depends on aquisition of an appropriate protective immune response. IFN-gamma, first produced by NK cells and then by Th1 cells, is central to acquired resistance against intracellular bacteria, including Listeria monocytogenes. In contrast, IL-4 is not generated to a measurable degree. Here we show that IL-4 is produced during listeriosis by IFN-gamma receptor gene disruption (IFN-gammaR(-/-)) mutant mice. Production of TNF was diminished, whereas IL-12 production was virtually unchanged in these mutants. Neutralization of IL-4 with anti-IL-4 mAb, as well as TNF-alpha reconstitution with rTNF-alpha, ameliorated listeriosis. These findings demonstrate the detrimental effects of IL-4 in listeriosis independent of IFN-gamma down-regulation and document the far-reaching consequences of a single cytokine deficiency on other cytokines. In cases where the primary gene defect cannot be restored, precise identification of secondary effects will promote rational immunotherapy based on neutralization or reconstitution of secondary immune deviations.
