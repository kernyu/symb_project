Numerous broad-spectrum beta-lactam antimicrobial agents have been introduced into medical practice since 1985. Although several of these compounds have advanced, infectious disease therapy resistances to them has also emerged world-wide. In 1997, a Japanese 22 medical center investigation was initiated to assess the continued utility of these agents (oxacillin or piperacillin, ceftazidime, cefepime, cefpirome, cefoperazone/sulbactam [C/S], imipenem). The participating medical centers represented a wide geographic distribution, and a common protocol and reagents were applied. Three control strains and a set of challenge organisms were provided to participant centers. Etest (AB BIODISK, Solna, Sweden) strips were used in concurrent tests of these organisms and a qualitative determination of participant skills in the identification of resistant and susceptible phenotypes was established. The quantitative controls demonstrated 97.7-99.2% of MIC values within established QC limits, and the qualitative (susceptibility category) controls documented a 97.3% agreement of participant results with that of reference values (1,320 total results). Only 0.2% of values were false-susceptible errors. After the participant quality was assured, a total of 2,015 clinical strains were tested (10 strains from 10 different organism groups including methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci [CoNS], Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter spp., indole-positive Proteae, Serratia spp., Acinetobacter spp., and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). The staphylococci were uniformly susceptible to all drugs tested except ceftazidime (MIC90, 24 micrograms/ml) that had a potency six- to 12-fold less than either cefepime or cefpirome. Only 3.7 and 45.1% of S. aureus and CoNS were susceptible to ceftazidime, respectively. Among E. coli and Klebsiella spp. the rank order of antimicrobial spectrum was imipenem = "fourth-generation" cephalosporins > ceftazidime > C/S > piperacillin. Possible extended spectrum beta-lactamase phenotypes were identified in 2.9-8.6% of these isolates. Isolates of C. freundii, Enterobacter spp., Proteae, and Serratia spp. that were resistant to ceftazidime and piperacillin remained susceptible to imipenem (0.0-4.5% resistance) and cefepime (0.0-5.0%). Acinetobacters were inhibited best by C/S (99.5% susceptible) and least susceptible to piperacillin (MIC90, > 256 micrograms/ml; 21.7% susceptible) activity. P. aeruginosa isolates were most susceptible to cefepime (83.6%) and this zwitterionic cephalosporin also had the lowest level of resistance (9.1% of MICs at > or = 32 micrograms/ml). Several multi-resistant organisms were identified in participant medical centers including S. marcescens strains resistant to cefepime, imipenem, or both observed in six hospitals. Clonal spread was documented in two medical centers; one hospital having two distinct epidemic clusters. Also a multi-resistant E. cloacae was found in two patients in the same hospital. Evaluations of carbapenem resistance in four species discovered only two strains (in same hospital) among 40 P. aeruginosa isolates (5.0%) with a metallo-enzyme, with nearly all of the remaining strains inhibited by an Ambler Class C enzyme inhibitor (BRL42715) indicating a hyperproduction of a chromosomal cephalosporinase. These results indicate that most newer beta-lactams remain widely useable in medical centers in Japan, but emerging often clonal, resistances have occurred. The overall rank order of antimicrobial spectrum against all ten tested bacterial groups favors the "fourth-generation" cephalosporin, cefepime (96.4% susceptible) as an equal to imipenem (95.9%) > C/S (90.9%) = cefpirome (90.0%) > ceftazidime (75.1%) = penicillins, either oxacillin or piperacillin (76.4%).
