The strategy of antimicrobial therapy in acute otitis media rests on bacteriologic and pharmacokinetic data. Pneumococci and Haemophilus are still the two most prevalent pathogens in acute otitis media and raise problems regarding susceptibility: 25% of Haemophilus beta-strains produce beta-lactamases and 6 to 12% of pneumococci are intermediate or resistant to penicillin. Pharmacologic features required of antimicrobials used in acute otitis media include good penetration in the ear and sustained supra-MIC levels in middle ear fluid. Kinetics of drugs in the ear are still often incompletely understood. The last selection criterion is analysis of comparative trials. Available data do not point to superiority of any drug over the others. Amoxicillin should no longer be given as first-line therapy. Amoxicillin combined with clavulanic acid (Augmentin) is effective on the entire spectrum of causative organisms. Higher levels of amoxicillin may be needed (concomitant use of amoxicillin and (Augmentin). First-generation cephalosporins are effective but may prove unsuccessful in patients with large inocula. Pediazole is clinically effective although penetration of erythromycin in the ear is delayed. The new oral third generation cephalosporins are effective in infections due to beta-lactamase-producing Haemophilus strains. A bacteriologic study should be performed routinely whenever otitis media occurs in an infant under three months of age.
