AIM: To monitor the anti-HIV-1 activity of antiretroviral agents in patients with HIV-1 infection. METHOD: Quantification of viral RNA copy in plasma or serum using a polymerase chain reaction method coupled with reverse transcription. CONCLUSIONS: The HIV-1 RNA copy number represents the HIV-1 viremia status in patients with HIV-1 infection. This copy number is likely to be useful in monitoring the effectiveness of antiviral therapy and the method is likely to be built into every clinical trial of anti-HIV-1 therapy in the near future.
