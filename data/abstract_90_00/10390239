Thirty-six pyrazinamide-resistant and eight pyrazinamide-susceptible Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates from Russia were analyzed for their pncA mutations. Thirty-one (86.1%) of the resistant isolates had a mutation either in pncA or upstream of the gene. Twenty of the 23 different mutations found in this study had not been described earlier. pncA genotype correlated well with pyrazinamidase activity and BACTEC 460 susceptibility test results.
