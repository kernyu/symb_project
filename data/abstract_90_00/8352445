High sucrose diet-induced insulin resistance and mild glucose intolerance are associated with decreased insulin binding to isolated adipocytes and reduced insulin action in adipose tissue. Enhanced dietary intake of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3-FA) counteracts these disorders. To provide more information on the possible role of membrane-related glucose transport processes, basal and insulin-stimulated 2-deoxy-D-3H glucose uptake was evaluated in isolated adipocytes obtained from rats on various dietary regimens. For 2 weeks animals were fed three different isocaloric (18 cal% proteins, 19 cal% fat, and 63 cal% carbohydrate) diets: (1) a standard rat chow (B), (2) a high sucrose diet (S, 63 cal% sucrose), or (3) an S diet supplemented with marine fish oil (S + FO, Martens, 30 wt% of n-3-FA). High dietary n-3-FA intake resulted in a significant decline in both basal (0.05 +/- 0.01 pmol/10(6) fat cells; mean +/- SEM) and insulin-stimulated (10(-6) M) (0.20 +/- 0.01) glucose uptake when compared with the control (basal: 0.12 +/- 0.02; insulin: 0.35 +/- 0.02) and/or the S group (basal: 0.18 +/- 0.03; insulin: 0.43 +/- 0.03), indicating decreases in insulin responsiveness and sensitivity (ED50: B: 0.03 +/- 0.01; S: 0.03 +/- 0.01; S + FO: 0.73 +/- 0.2 nM; p < 0.01 for S + FO vs B and S + FO vs S). Fish oil supplementation induced an increase in adipocyte size (B: 69 +/- 1.6; S: 70 +/- 2.5 and S + FO: 76 +/- 2.2 microns; B: S + FO p < 0.05) and a decrease in plasma membrane microviscosity (B: 4.08 +/- 0.3; S: 5.39 +/- 0.5; S + FO: 3.10 +/- 0.3; p < 0.05). Rates of basal and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake did not correlate with plasma membrane microviscosity; however, a negative relation to fat cell size was found (r = -0.484; p < 0.05). On the other hand, a positive correlation between both basal (r = 0.504; p < 0.05) and insulin-stimulated (10(-6) M, r = 0.640; p < 0.02) glucose uptake and blood glucose levels was observed. In conclusion, these data (a) suggest a less important role of diet-induced changes in plasma membrane microviscosity for glucose uptake in adipose tissue, and (b) leave unclear the mechanism of why dietary fish oil decreases the sensitivity of glucose uptake to insulin in isolated rat adipocytes.
