OBJECTIVE: This survey examined the current management of continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) peritonitis and the effectiveness of the various antibiotic protocols in use. DESIGN: The information required was elicited via a postal questionnaire. SETTING: The questionnaire was posted to each renal dialysis unit offering CAPD throughout the North and South Thames National Health Service regions. PATIENTS: All patients using CAPD at each responding unit were eligible for inclusion. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Each unit provided details of their CAPD peritonitis episodes for 1997. Each unit's empirical treatment regimen for CAPD peritonitis was sought in addition to response rates. Also requested were numbers for peritonitis episodes, recurrences, and negative cultures, plus the peritonitis rate per patient-month. RESULTS: Thirteen units returned the questionnaire (87% of the survey population). Nine of the 13 units were using vancomycin regimens, with the remainder using cephalosporin regimens. The results were compared to the audit standards of the British Renal Association. Seventy percent of units reached the 80% mark for response rate; similar results were achieved with both the vancomycin and cephalosporin regimens. Ninety-two percent achieved the suggested peritonitis rate of 1 episode every 18 patient-months; 30% achieved the culture-negative rate of 10%. The average recurrence rate was 19%. CONCLUSION: The units contacted achieved most of the standards suggested by the British Renal Association; however, wide variations did exist. Recent guidelines have suggested avoiding vancomycin-based regimens in order to reduce the incidence of vancomycin resistance. The suggested regimen of a cephalosporin with an aminoglycoside seems to represent a suitable alternative.
