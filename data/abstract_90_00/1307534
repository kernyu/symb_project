Twenty four culture proved and nine postmortem histopathology proved cases of enteric fever were analysed retrospectively with special interest in use of various antisalmonella agents. Chloramphenicol resistance was noted in 91.7% and yet 70% of all patients received chloramphenicol alone or in combination with another antisalmonella agent. Time required for remission of fever with chloramphenical, cotrimoxazole and ciprofloxacin was 4.5, 4.1 and 6.9 days respectively. An interesting feature noted in post-mortem histopathology proved cases was enteric carditis which was documented on postmortem examination of the heart in three out of four patients who died of peripheral circulatory failure.
