An A1400G mutation of the rrs gene was identified in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) strain ATCC 35827 and in 13 MTB clinical isolates resistant to amikacin-kanamycin (MICs, >128 microg/ml). High-level cross-resistance may result from such a mutation since MTB has a single copy of the rrs gene. Another mechanism(s) may account for high-level amikacin-kanamycin resistance in two mutants and lower levels of resistance in four clinical isolates, all lacking the A1400G mutation.
