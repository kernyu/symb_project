Mucocutaneous candidiasis, such as oropharyngeal candidiasis, esophageal candidiasis, and vulvovaginal candidiasis, are common problems in patients with HIV infection. These conditions adversely affect patient quality of life and morbidity status. New oral triazole agents provide improved treatment options for patients with these and other opportunistic fungal infections; however, the development of resistance in some Candida species poses new challenges. This article provides an overview of the diagnosis of mucocutaneous candidiasis, current treatment modalities, concomitant drug interactions, common adverse drug reactions, and the emergence of fungal resistance, and it suggests nursing interventions to maximize patient benefits from antifungal therapy.
