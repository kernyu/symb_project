BACKGROUND: Eradication of Helicobacter pylori with antimicrobials was recommended by a recent NIH consensus panel for all infected patients with peptic ulcer disease. The precise regimen that should be used for eradication of the infection remains uncertain because of the variety of regimens described, variable results with the regimens, and difficulties in predicting drug compliance outside clinical trials. METHODS: A decision analysis tree was developed with three regimens that are widely used regimens for the eradication of H. pylori: 1) 2-wk triple drug therapy (metronidazole, bismuth, tetracycline with H2 receptor antagonist), 2) 2-wk omeprazole and amoxicillin, and 3) 2-wk omeprazole and clarithromycin. Traditional H2 receptor antagonist therapy was used for comparison. A 2-yr time period was chosen for study to allow sufficient time for relapse and to evaluate its effect on the treatment strategy. Probabilities for eradication, compliance, and metronidazole resistance were determined from published data, and assumptions were tested by sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: Standard 2-wk triple drug therapy was the least expensive strategy ($720), and conventional H2 receptor antagonist therapy was the most expensive ($1791). Costs with 2-wk therapy with omeprazole and clarithromycin ($768) were lower than with omeprazole and amoxicillin ($1028). CONCLUSIONS: Treatment to eradicate H. pylori in infected patients with duodenal ulcer is a less expensive strategy than traditional therapy with H2 receptor antagonists. Triple drug therapy is the optimal regimen in areas where metronidazole resistance rates are < 36% and compliance is > 53%. Omeprazole and amoxicillin is not cost-effective unless eradication rates are greater than 74%. Dual drug therapy with omeprazole and clarithromycin is effective in regions where metronidazole resistance is high or where it is anticipated that there would be poor compliance with the more complicated triple drug therapy regimen.
