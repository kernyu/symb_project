Using a checkerboard assay, ampicillin, vancomycin, and RP 59500, each in combination with chloramphenicol, were tested for synergy against 23 isolates of vancomycin-resistant enterococci. Additive effects were seen in 62.5% of the isolates when exposed to chloramphenicol plus RP 59500. Additive effects were observed in 20% and 15% of isolates with chloramphenicol plus vancomycin or ampicillin, respectively. No antagonism was noted.
