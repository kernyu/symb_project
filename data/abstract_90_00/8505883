The purpose of the present work was to investigate the susceptibility of S. pyogenes to antimicrobial agents. The strains have been taken from the bacteriological Service of Charles Nicolle's hospital at Tunis, and that during the period from January 1988- to December 1990. The antibiogram results as well as the minimal inhibitrice concentration determined by the agar diffusion technique, reveal that S. pyogenes continues to be very susceptible to the beta-lactamins (M.I.C. of penicillin G is "0.15 for 50% of strains tested. Resistance are noted for chloramphenicol; tetracycline and novobiocine (13%, 93%, 80%) not considered as good antibiotics anti-streptococcies. The macrolids are effective against S. pyogenes (100% of susceptibility) that's they are considered as the best alternating antimicrobiologents to the beta-lactamins (M.I.C. of erythromycin is 0.015.
