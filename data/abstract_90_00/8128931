We examined the bacteria isolated from urine of patients in our department from 1988 though 1989. A total of 809 strains were isolated from the outpatients. They were 241 strains of gram-positive bacteria (29.8%). E. coli (32.0%) was isolated most frequently, followed by Enterococcus spp. (9.9%), Proteus group (7.4%), S. epidermidis (6.2%), P. aeruginosa (5.1%) and others. A total of 412 strains were isolated from the inpatients. They consisted of 173 strains of gram-positive bacteria (42.0%). Enterococcus spp. (17.0%) was isolated most frequently, followed by P. aeruginosa (12.6%), S. epidermidis (9.7%), E. coli (7.3%), S. aureus (6.6%) and others. Fewer P. aeruginosa, S. marcescens and Proteus group were isolated from the outpatients and fewer S. marcescens, E. coli and K. pneumoniae from inpatients than previously. More S. aureus were isolated abruptly from the inpatients and more E. coli were isolated from the outpatients than previously. E. cloacae, S. epidermidis, S. aureus and Corynebacterium spp. all isolated from inpatients showed lower antimicrobial sensitivity than those isolated from the outpatients.
