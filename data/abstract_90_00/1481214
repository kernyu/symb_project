Eight hundred and fifty-four piglets which died or were euthanized due to pneumonia or rhinitis atrophicans, were investigated during the period of 1986-1990. Of the animals, 569 showed bronchopneumonia, 218 had pleuritis, pericarditis and peritonitis, 165 had rhinitis atrophicans, 58 pleuropneumonia, and 9 animals had fibrinous pneumonia. Pasteurella multocida, Haemophilus parasuis, Bordetella bronchiseptica, Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae and Pasteurella haemolytica were isolated in 59.1%, 29.5%, 27.8%, 3.7%, and 2.3% cases of bronchopneumonia respectively. Samples from pigs with pleuritis or rhinitis atrophicans showed Pasteurella multocida in 63.8 and 68.5%, Bordetella bronchiseptica in 28.4 and 39.4%, streptococci in 28.9 and 3.9%, Haemophilus parasuis in 25.2% and 20.6%, Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae in 5.1 and 5.5%, and Pasteurella haemolytica in 3.2 and 3.0%, respectively Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae was found in 51 of 58 cases of pleuropneumonia and in 5 of 9 cases of fibrinous pneumonia; 55.6% and 44.4% respectively of those forms of pneumonia were positive for Pasteurella multocida. In the agar diffusion test, 36.8-82.6% of bacterial isolates showed resistance to streptomycin, 7.7-45.5% to sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, 5.7-44.6% to tetracycline, 0.2-32.8% to ampicillin, 0.0-16.3% to lincospectin, 2.0-81.2% to furazolidone, 0.4-4.5% to chloramphenicol, 1.3-78.1% to penicillin and 0-0.3% to enrofloxacin.
