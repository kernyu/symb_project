Protein-polysaccharide conjugate vaccines against Streptococcus pneumoniae promise to be an effective public health intervention for children, especially in an era of increasing antimicrobial resistance. To characterize the distribution of capsular types in Latin America, surveillance for invasive pneumococcal infection in children < or = 5 years of age was done in six countries between February 1993 and April 1996. Fifty percent of 1,649 sterile-site isolates were from children with pneumonia, and 52% were isolated from blood. The 15 most common of the capsular types prevalent throughout the region accounted for 87.7% of all isolates. Overall, 24.9% of isolates had diminished susceptibility to penicillin: 16.7% had intermediate resistance and 8.3% had high-level resistance. Three customized vaccine formulas containing 7, 12, and 15 capsular types were found to have regional coverages of 72%, 85%, and 88%, respectively. This study emphasizes the need for local surveillance for invasive pneumococcal disease prior to the development and evaluation of protein-polysaccharide conjugate vaccines for children.
