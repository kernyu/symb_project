Calcium transport in the apical-to-basolateral (A-to-B) or B-to-A direction was examined in cells treated with 10 nM 1, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25(OH)2D3, calcitriol] for up to 72 h. Net A-to-B calcium transport was positive at all time points and increased from 0.14 +/- 0.06 to 0.50 +/- 0.01 nmol. well-1. min-1 after 72 h of calcitriol treatment. Neither phenol red transport nor transepithelial electrical resistance was altered by calcitriol treatment, suggesting that the increase in net A-to-B calcium transport was not due to paracellular movement. Neither 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 nor 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (100 nM, 48 h) alters basal or calcitriol-stimulated A-to-B calcium transport. Treatment with the calmodulin antagonist trifluoperazine (50 microM) reduced calcitriol-stimulated A-to-B Ca transport by 56%. The transcription inhibitor actinomycin D inhibited calcitriol-regulated A-to-B calcium transport as well as calbindin D9k and 24-hydroxylase mRNA accumulation. These data demonstrate that calcitriol-mediated A-to-B calcium transport in Caco-2 cells is a specific, transcellular process that requires transcriptional events normally mediated through the vitamin D receptor.
