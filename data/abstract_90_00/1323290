Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF-R) is a widely expressed ligand-dependent tyrosine kinase. The tyrosine residue at 845 in EGF-R corresponds to Y416 of v/c-src kinase, which is highly conserved and functionally important in many tyrosine kinases. To clarify the functional role of Y845, we constructed a mutant human EGF-R in which this tyrosine was replaced with phenylalanine and transfected it to NIH3T3 cells. EGF-R F845 induced EGF-dependent cellular transformation and revealed tyrosine-autophosphorylation of a 170 kDa protein, and initiated DNA synthesis similar to the wild-type EGF-R. We conclude here that Y845 is dispensable in the above mentioned functions of EGF-R tyrosine kinase.
