Surveillance for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was implemented in Rio de Janeiro and Uberlandia University Hospitals, which had different policies on use of mupirocin. One hundred fourteen multiresistant MRSA strains were isolated from 62 patients. Mupirocin resistance was observed in 63% of strains in Rio de Janeiro, where there was extensive use of topical mupirocin, and 6.1% in Uberlandia, where its use was rare.
