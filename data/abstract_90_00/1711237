The administration of a hypercholesterolaemic (HC) diet rendered genetically resistant A/J mice susceptible to mouse hepatitis virus 3 (MHV3) infection. The animals died of acute hepatitis with high viral titres in the liver accompanied by many necrotic foci and high serum transaminase levels. Resistance to virus was re-established by refeeding HC mice with a normal diet for 2 weeks. This modification of pathogenesis was accompanied by an increase in the susceptibility of hepatocyte cultures from HC mice to MHV3 and could be explained by an enhancement in virus adsorption. We hypothesize that the incorporation of cholesterol into the plasma membranes of hepatocytes of HC mice, thereby decreasing the membrane fluidity, may lead to an increase in the availability of virus receptors.
