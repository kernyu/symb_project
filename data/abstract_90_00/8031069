MICs of six extended-spectrum cephalosporins (cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, FK 037, cefpirome, cefepime), three carbapenems (imipenem, meropenem, biapenem), and vancomycin for 49 penicillin-susceptible (S), 77 penicillin intermediate-resistant (I), and 51 penicillin-resistant (R) pneumococci were determined by agar dilution. Compared with ceftazidime (MICs for 90% of strains tested [MIC90s] of 2.0, 16.0, and 16.0 micrograms/ml for S, I, and R strains, respectively), all other cephalosporins yielded lower MICs (MIC90s of 0.06 to 0.125, 0.5 to 1.0, and 1.0 to 2.0 micrograms/ml against S, I, and R strains, respectively). All three carbapenems were very active, with MIC90s, even for R strains, of < or = 1.0 micrograms/ml. All strains were susceptible to vancomycin (MIC90 of 0.5 micrograms/ml).
