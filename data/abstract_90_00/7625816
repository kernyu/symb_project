A total of 184 isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae were recovered from the sputa of patients over a 5-year period in the Nagasaki area and were examined. A total of 30 strains were resistant to penicillin (MIC, > or = 0.10 micrograms/ml), 13 of which belonged to serotype 19B. These strains showed decreased susceptibility to other antimicrobial agents. Vancomycin, cefpirome, and imipenem were the most active agents tested.
