15/60 subjects from one center, who all took part in a multicenter double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the effect of norfloxacin on acute enteritis, had norfloxacin sensitive strains of Campylobacter jejuni in pre-study stool specimens. Eight of the 15 subjects received active drug. In 3 of these 8, high-level quinolone resistant Campylobacter strains of the same serotype as in pre-treatment samples were isolated 4-90 days after the initiation of treatment.
