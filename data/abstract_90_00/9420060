We have developed a new recombinant retroviral system in which a library of infectious molecular clones of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is constructed with reverse transcriptase (RT) genes derived from viral RNA sequences in plasma. HIV-1 RT is amplified from plasma HIV-1 RNA by nested RT-PCR and cloned into a RT-defective HIV-1 proviral vector (xxLAI-np), generating 10(3) to 10(4) recombinant proviral clones from each reaction. The bulk cloning products or individual molecular clones are transfected into MT-2 cells to generate infectious virus. The resultant viruses are assayed for drug susceptibility in CD4+ cell lines to determine either the dominant phenotype of the recombinant virus mixture or the phenotypes of the individual viral clones. DNA sequencing of the cloned RT genes can identify mutations associated with phenotypic resistance of clonal mixtures or individual clones. This method can be used to rapidly detect the in vivo emergence of HIV-1 quasispecies resistant to RT inhibitors.
