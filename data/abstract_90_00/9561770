The construction of a new post-column photochemical reactor with quartz flow cells in series for high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) is described. The performance of the new reactor was compared with a conventional open tubular PTFE coil reactor. The sensitivity, accuracy and precision obtained with both reactors are comparable. The new reactor has the obvious advantages of smaller cell volume as well as inertness and resistance to not only light and heat produced by the UV lamp, but also to organic solvents in the mobile phases, which results in greatly improved durability, reduced peak broadening and shorter chromatographic run times. Application of the new reactor to the fluorescence detection of DU-6859a, a new fluoroquinolone antimicrobial agent, in human serum is reported.
