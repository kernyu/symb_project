OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of the coadministration of the multidrug resistance (MDR) modulators cyclosporin A (CyA) alone or plus dexverapamil (D-Ver) on idarubicin (IDA) pharmacokinetics in patients with acute leukemia. METHODS: Pharmacokinetic studies were performed in 27 patients with a diagnosis of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), who were being treated with a combination chemotherapy regimen including idarubicin and cytarabine for the induction of a first remission (n = 14), or of a second remission (n = 7), or for remission consolidation (n = 6). Of these 27 patients, nine were coadministered CyA and seven were coadministered CyA plus D-Ver as MDR modulators. Blood was sampled at appropriate intervals after each of the three IDA daily administrations. IDA and idarubicinol (IDAOL) were assayed by HPLC. Pharmacokinetic evaluations were performed by means of a two-compartment open model with zero-order absorption and first-order elimination using the WinNonlin pharmacokinetic software package. RESULTS: CyA markedly increased the area under the concentration time-curve (AUC) of both IDA [558.26 (197.25) microg x h x l(-1) vs 315.44 (158.28) microg x h x l(-1); P < 0.01] and IDAOL [2896.60 (736.38) microg x h x l(-1) vs 1028.49 (603.95) microg x h x l(-1); P < 0.001] when coadministered as a single modulator, due to a lower total body clearance (CL) [83.51 (52.44) l x h(-1) x m(-2) vs 139.65 (69.45) l x h(-1) x m(-2); NS]. When patients received two MDR modulators simultaneously (D-Ver plus CyA), IDA exposure was essentially the same as in those of the no inhibitor group [331.29 (95.49) microg x h x l(-1) vs 315.44 (158.28) microg x h x l(-1); NS], whereas the IDAOL total body exposure was greater than in the no inhibitor group [2030.32 (401.11) microg x h x l(-1) vs 1028.49 (603.95) microg x h x l(-1); P < 0.01], even if less than in patients receiving CyA as a single MDR modulator (IDA + CyA group) [AUC 2030.32 (401.11) microg x h x l(-1) vs 2896.60 (736.38) microg x h x l(-1); P < 0.05], suggesting an antagonistic effect against those of CyA on IDA and IDAOL elimination and/or an unpredictable redistribution. The main pharmacokinetic parameters of IDA, such as CL and volume of distribution at steady state (Vdss), were remarkably affected by the coadministration of CyA or CyA plus D-Ver, but no statistically significant difference was noted because of IDA pharmacokinetic interpatient variation. CONCLUSION: The results show that CyA alone at a dose of 10 mg x kg(-1) daily significantly increased systemic body exposure to both IDA and IDAOL in acute leukemia, and suggest that these pharmacokinetic effects were at least partially decreased when D-Ver was coadministered with CyA. Our findings raise important questions concerning the need for a dosage adjustment of IDA when MDR modulators are coadministered.
