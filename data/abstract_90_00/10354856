A Cycling Probe Technology (CPT) assay was developed for the detection of the mecA gene from methicillin resistant staphylococcal cultures. The assay is based on a colorimetric enzyme-immuno-assay (EIA) and uses a mecA probe (DNA-RNA-DNA) labeled with fluorescein at the 5'-terminus and biotin at the 3'-terminus. The reaction occurs at a constant temperature that allows the target DNA to anneal to the probe. RNase H cuts the RNA portion, allowing the cut fragments to dissociate from the target, making it available for further cycling. CPT-EIA uses streptavidin-coated microplate wells to capture uncut probe followed by detection with horseradish-peroxidase conjugated anti-fluorescein antibody. The assay was compared to PCR and shown to accurately detect the presence or absence of the mecA gene in 159 staphylococcal clinical isolates. The CPT-EIA assay takes two hours starting from cultured cells compared with the 24-48 h required for detection of methicillin resistance by conventional susceptibility tests.
