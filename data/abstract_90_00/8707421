SDZ PSC833 (PSC833), an analogue of cyclosporines, is one of the most potent modulators of multi-drug resistance (MDR). We previously reported that MRK-16, an anti-P-glycoprotein MAb, enhanced MDR reversal activity of cyclosporin A (CsA) through inhibition of P-glycoprotein-mediated CsA transport. We have examined here whether MRK-16 can enhance MDR reversal activity of PSC833. We found that MRK-16 potentiated the MDR reversal activity of PSC833, and of CsA, in MDR sublines of human myelocytic leukemia K562 and human ovarian cancer A2780 cells. Like MRK-16 combined with CsA, MRK-16 enhanced the effect of a sub-optimum dose of PSC833 on vincristine accumulation in MDR cells. However, MRK-16 could not increase cellular accumulation of PSC833 in MDR tumor cells, yet it could increase cellular accumulation of CsA. P-glycoprotein could not transport PSC833 but could transport CsA. Our results indicate that MRK-16 potentiates the MDR reversal activity of both PSC833 and CsA, yet also suggest that the molecular mechanism of the potentiation differs between the two substances.
