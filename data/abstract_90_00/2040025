Cells resistant to 3 x 10(-5) M CdCl2 (Cdr cells) were isolated from cultures of Chinese hamster V79 cells by a procedure that involved stepwise increase in the concentration of Cd2+ and subsequent mass selection. Cdr cells grew as fast as wild-type cells (Cds) in medium without cadmium. Cdr cells were not cross-resistant to other divalent metal ions, such as Hg2+, Ni2+, Pb2+, and Zn2+. Both Cds and Cdr cells induced similar levels of metallothioneins (MT) in response to zinc. Depletion of glutathione (GSH) did not significantly influence the sensitivity of Cdr cells to Cd2+ but markedly enhanced the sensitivity to Cd2+ of Cds cells. Furthermore, the rate of synthesis of GSH after depletion did not differ greatly between sensitive and resistant cells. The rate of uptake of 109Cd2+ by Cdr cells was only 10-15% that by Cds cells. The difference in rates of uptake between Cds and Cdr cells was observed irrespective of the presence or absence of serum in the culture medium. These results indicate that, in this system, resistance to Cd2+ is attributable neither to increased inducibility of MT nor to increases in intracellular levels of GSH, and that only a decrease in the rate of uptake of Cd2+ contributes to the acquisition of resistance to Cd2+. Uptake of Cd2+ by cells was dependent on temperature and the rate of uptake of Cd2+ by Cdr cells was lower at all temperatures examined than the rate of uptake by Cds cells. Cycloheximide did not suppress the uptake of Cd2+, suggesting that uptake does not require synthesis of cell proteins de novo. Preincubation of cells with N-ethylmaleimide suppressed the uptake of Cd2+ to some extent, a result that suggests the involvement of surface SH groups in the uptake of Cd2+ by these cells.
