A 5.8-kb chromosomal fragment isolated from Coxiella burnetii initiates plasmid replication in Escherichia coli and was characterized as an autonomous replication sequence, ars (M. Suhan, S.-Y. Chen, H.A. Thompson, T.A. Hoover, A. Hill, and J.C. Williams, J. Bacteriol. 176:5233-5243, 1994). In the present study, an ars replicon was used to transform C. burnetii to ampicillin resistance. Plasmid pSKO(+)1000 contained the C. burnetii ars sequence cloned into a ColE1-type replicon encoding beta-lactamase. pSKO(+)1000 was introduced into C. burnetii by electroporation. Ampicillin-resistant cells were selected, and survivors were examined for the transformed genotype by Southern hybridization. Transformants stably maintained the pSKO(+)1000 bla DNA sequence in the chromosome as a result of homologous recombination. The recombination event resulted in the duplication of the 5.8-kb ars sequence in the C. burnetii chromosome. The bla gene was also located in an episome. However, an ampicillin resistance plasmid lacking the C. burnetii ars sequence did not stably transform C. burnetii. A biological assay analyzing beta-lactamase activity of C. burnetii transformants during acid activation in vitro provided evidence for expression of the bla (beta-lactamase) gene.
