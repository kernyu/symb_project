Strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae FL200 capable of growing on a solid medium containing a mixture of polyene macrolide antibiotics (nystatin, 40 micrograms/ml, amphotericin B, 40 micrograms/ml, pimaricin, 150 micrograms/ml and RP9971 antibiotic, 10 micrograms/ml) have been isolated after successive selection steps. The mutant strains, PR13 and PRC24, are 10 to 100 times more resistant than the polyene macrolide antibiotics. When 4% Tween 80 is added to the medium, resistance to these antifungal drugs is further increased. In addition, strain PRC24, derived from strain PR13, is resistant to a non-polyene macrolide antifungal antibiotic, cycloheximide. In contrast, PR13 and PRC24 are both highly susceptible to a large range of compounds, including non-polyenic antifungal, antitumor and antibacterial agents. These particular characteristics make these strains useful for the rapid detection of antifungal compounds of the polyene macrolide and cycloheximide types, as well as for the recognition of antimitotic substances.
