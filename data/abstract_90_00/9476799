We have isolated the pteridine reductase-1 gene (ptr1), from Trypanosoma cruzi (Y strain), located contiguous to the Trypanosoma cruzi P-glycoprotein-2 (tcpgp2). The gene encodes a member of the family of short-chain dehydrogenases, enzymes that are involved in several oxidoreduction reactions. One member of the family, pteridine reductase-1 (PTR1) has been previously described in Leishmania as being involved in antifolate resistance. The ptr1 gene from T. cruzi presents an 828 bp open reading frame, coding for a 276 amino acid protein with a predicted molecular mass of 30 kDa. The deduced amino acid sequence exhibited a remarkable homology with the ptr1 genes of Leishmania major and Leishmania tarentolae. Southern blot analysis using a specific probe indicated that T. cruzi PTR1 is encoded by a single copy gene located in two chromosomes of about 0.9 and 1.2 Mb. Western blot analysis using a polyclonal antiserum against recombinant PTR1 revealed that the protein is only expressed in the epimastigote forms of the parasite; we did not detect the protein either in the amastigote or trypomastigote forms. Purified recombinant PTR1 exhibits a NADPH-dependent pteridine reductase activity comparable with those described in Leishmania. Gene transfection experiments using the pTEX expression vector show that, under the conditions tested, T. cruzi PTR1 is involved in resistance to the methotrexate, aminopterin and trimethoprim antifolates.
