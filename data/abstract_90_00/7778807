The preoperative administration of a new antibiotic for antimicrobial prophylaxis is questionable because of the methodological difficulties to demonstrate its efficiency and benefits in decreasing the postoperative infectious complications. As their rate is very low, especially in clean surgery, the number of patients to be included in a comparative trial is very high. Most studies assessed only small groups and therefore any extrapolation for clinical practice is of limited value. Because of their therapeutic efficiency the fluoroquinolones are often recommended for antimicrobial prophylaxis. However, the rapid occurrence of resistances, directly related to their prescription should invite the prescribers to be cautions. They should be contra-indicated as long as an alternative of similar efficiency is existing, in case of bacteraemia, when an administration of more than 48 hours in required or when the intra-hospital resistance rate exceeds 10 p. 100.
