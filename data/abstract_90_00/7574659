We isolated 12 strains of Thermoplasma acidophilum from hot springs in Hakone, Japan. T. acidophilum strains showed morphological variation in the crystal-like structure in the cell and the fibrous structure on the cell surface. Two strains tested were sensitive to novobiocin. However, a novobiocin-resistant mutant was obtained by spontaneous mutation.
