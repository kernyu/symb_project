Eighty-eight women with a history of recurrent urinary tract infection (at least four attacks in the preceding 12 months) were randomized to take either norfloxacin 200 mg at night (45 patients) or macrocrystalline nitrofurantoin 100 mg at night (43 patients) for 12 months. A decrease in the number of symptomatic attacks while taking this prophylaxis was observed in 94 per cent of the patients and this improvement was maintained during the 6 months following the end of prophylaxis in 69 per cent. The mean interval between symptomatic episodes while taking prophylaxis was 7.2-fold and 6.9-fold greater, respectively, than in the 12 months before starting prophylaxis. There were only nine breakthrough infections during 74 patient-years of prophylaxis, four in patients taking norfloxacin (two enterococci, one Staphylococcus epidermidis, one Escherichia coli), and five in those taking macrocrystalline nitrofurantoin (four E. coli, one Klebsiella pneumoniae). Adverse events caused four patients taking norfloxacin (8 per cent) and seven taking macrocrystalline nitrofurantoin (14 per cent) to stop prophylaxis. Norfloxacin had a marked suppressive effect on the coliform part of the faecal flora, with no emergence of resistance. Thus, norfloxacin appears to be an excellent alternative agent to macrocrystalline nitrofurantoin for the prevention of recurrent urinary infections.
