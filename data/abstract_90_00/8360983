As one of the biodefense mechanisms, lactoferrin (LFN) in the secreta of female genital organ may be an interesting biological material in view of its antimicrobial activity. In the present study, we investigated antimicrobial activities of LFN and its combination with cefpodoxime proxetil (CPDX-PR), we also as evaluated clinical effect of CPDX-PR. The following results were obtained. 1. Antimicrobial activities of LFN were tested against 15 strains of 10 species of bacteria, and potent activities against Staphylococcus aureus 209P, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus spp. were found. 2. In a concomitant use of LFN with CPDX-PR (a checkerboard method), synergistic actions were observed against S. aureus 209P, E. coli STf, K. pneumoniae 602 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa 1046, and additive actions against E. coli NIHJ and Providencia rettgeri 1603. In 3 strains, the MICs of CPDX-PR in the presence of LFN were reduced to < 1/64. 3. In the evaluation of clinical effect of CPDX-PR, efficacy rates were 53/57 (92.9%) in a patient group with infections. The incidence of adverse reaction was 0/57.
