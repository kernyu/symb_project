The state and prospects of research on creation of antiadhesins--new generation drugs for preventing and treatment of infectious diseases, are analyzed in the paper. The elaboration of such drugs is based on the profound knowledge about the nature of viral, bacterial, fungal and other infectious agents of diseases, molecular mechanisms of their interactions with the affected organs and tissues which are based on the processes of carbohydrate-protein recognizing. Rapid development of such fields of science as glycobiology and lectinology has created the preconditions for artificial synthesis of oligosaccharides which mimicked the receptors and can interact with adhesive structures of the disease agents more intensively than their natural analogs and block them. This makes the interaction of the latter with the affected organs impossible. The intensive work on elaboration of natural drugs: antiadhesins, is carried out in most countries. Adhesins are not harmful for people and cannot provoke the development of resistance to them in the disease agents. Till recently Ukraine belonged to the number of countries where the fields of science mentioned above were intensively developed but, in connection with the present stagnation of science and even the artificial hindering of its development, the country gradually losses the position of a leader. Hence, one can conclude that when 10-15 years later the market of pharmaceutical products will be filled with antiadhesins, our country will not be on the list of their producers, if the authorities will spend funds to buy foreign drugs as before instead of stimulating the development and production of the home ones.
