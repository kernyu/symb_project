Introduction of the romA gene cloned from Enterobacter cloacae into Escherichia coli K-12 resulted in almost complete inhibition of OmpF expression and a concomitant increase in resistance to quinolones, beta-lactams, chloramphenicol, and tetracyclines. In addition, the romA gene reduced the susceptibility to these multiple drugs even in the OmpF porin-deficient mutants of E. coli K-12. Results indicate the presence of romA-sensitive penetration pathway(s) for these multiple drugs other than the OmpF porin in E. coli.
