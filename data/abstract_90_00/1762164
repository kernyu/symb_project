Clinical evaluations of cefdinir (CFDN) 10% granule were carried out. The obtained results are summarized as follows. 1. Clinical responses to CFDN of 23 patients with pediatric infections were excellent in 11 and good in 8. The overall efficacy rate was 82.6%. 2. Bacteriologically, the eradication rate for 23 strains of bacteria identified to be pathogens was evaluated and was 82.6%. 3. Side effects observed were diarrhea in 2 of 25 patients. The incidence was 8.0%. Abnormal laboratory test results observed included 2 cases with elevation of GOT and 1 case with elevation of GPT. These results suggest that CFDN 10% granule, as well as 5% granule, may be a very useful and safe drug for the treatment of pediatric infections.
