The novel quinoxaline GW420867X has been combined with a variety of nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) in HIV-1(IIIB)-infected CEM cell cultures. Whereas the antiviral efficacy of combinations of GW420867X with the NRTIs lamivudine (3TC) and abacavir (ABC) proved additive when administered to HIV-1-infected cells in a short-term (4-day) infection experiment, combination of GW420867X with the NRTIs 3TC and ABC resulted in a marked delay of virus breakthrough compared with the single drugs alone in a long-term (2-month) infection experiment. Delay of virus breakthrough was less pronounced for combinations of GW420867X with the NNRTIs. Combination of GW420867X with the NRTIs and NNRTIs resulted in additive inhibitory effects on recombinant HIV-1 reverse transcriptase as evident from isobolograms. Lamivudine plus GW420867X selected for the 3TC-specific M184I mutation and a number of NNRTI-characteristic mutations (i.e., V106A, V108I, and Y188H). Abacavir plus GW420867X selected only for NNRTI-specific mutations (i.e., K101E, K103R, V106A, and Y181C), including the novel L100V mutation. Combination of GW420867X with five different NNRTIs selected solely for NNRTI-specific mutations, and also for the L100V mutation in the combined presence of efavirenz, nevirapine, or emivirine, respectively. Five single-, two double-, and two triple-mutated HIV-1 strains that emerged from this study were evaluated for their sensitivity/resistance to AZT, lamivudine, and seven different NNRTIs. In all cases, efavirenz, GW420867X, and UC-781 retained pronounced antiviral potency. Our data suggest that combinations of GW420867X with 3TC, ABC, and NNRTIs (e.g., efavirenz) would be worth pursuing as therapeutic modalities against HIV-1 infections.
