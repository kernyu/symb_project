Non-typhoid Salmonella serovars remain a potential threat to human health, and beef cattle and broiler chickens are possible sources of these organisms on Prince Edward Island (PEI). In this study, the ceca of beef cattle belonging to fasted and non-fasted groups, and broiler chickens were examined for Salmonella at the time of slaughter. The characteristics of the isolates, including antimicrobial resistance patterns and virulence genes, were studied along with the isolates obtained from cases of human salmonellosis on PEI during the study period (1996-97). The prevalence of Salmonella in beef cattle was 4.6% (11/240). The rate was significantly higher in fasted cattle (7.46%), than in non-fasted cattle (0.94%). The prevalence rate in chickens was 32.5% (39/120). In beef cattle, Salmonella typhimurium phage type (PT) or definitive type (DT) 104 which was resistant to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, streptomycin, sulfisoxazole and tetracycline, was the most predominant type (64%). In chickens, S. heidelberg, with resistance to gentamicin, streptomycin and sulfisoxazole, predominated. Of 26 isolates from humans, the most common serovar was S. typhimurium, including a multidrug-resistant strain of DT104. Examination by PCR revealed presence of the virulence gene invA in all serovars, and the spvC gene in all S. typhimurium isolates, of both beef cattle and human origin. Among the other serovars the latter gene was found in 7 human isolates, but in none of the chicken or beef isolates. All but 3 of the spvC-positive isolates possessed a 90 kilobasepair (kbp) plasmid suggesting that the 3 isolates had the spvC gene on their chromosome. These findings were confirmed by plasmid DNA isolation using 3 different protocols and by sequence analysis of the spvC-PCR product.
