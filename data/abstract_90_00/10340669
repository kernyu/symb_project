The effect of nisin, added in the form of Nisaplin, on the thermal resistance of bacterial spores and the effects of medium composition, exposure time, and pH on nisin enhancement of heat sensitivity were evaluated. Nisin apparently required specific nutrients to sensitize spores to heat. For example, D130 degrees C values of approximately 10 s were observed in sodium phosphate buffer with and without 6% sucrose with no significant (P> or =0.05) differences detected as a result of increased nisin concentration. In a nutrient-rich chocolate milk model system (CMMS), increasing either the time of exposure to nisin (5, 15, or 24 h) before heating or nisin concentration (0, 2,000, or 4,000 IU/ml) increased the sensitivity of Bacillus stearothermophilus spores to heat. In the CMMS with 10 to 12% fat cocoa powder, increasing nisin concentration (at 5 h of exposure) significantly (P< or =0.05) reduced D130 degrees C values; D130 degrees C values were 21.7, 17.2, and 17.8 s, respectively, for the 0-, 2,000-, and 4,000-IU/ ml nisin treatments. Fifteen and 24 h of exposure further reduced D130 degrees C values in the nisin-containing treatments compared to the control (0 IU of nisin per ml). A lower-fat CMMS (0 to 1% fat cocoa powder) had lower D130 degrees C values (19.3, 15.8, and 14.7 s for the 0-, 2,000-, and 4,000-IU/ml nisin treatments, respectively). Nisin activity was enhanced by lowering pH in the CMMS (10 to 12% fat cocoa powder), with reductions in D130 degrees C values across all pH values (ranging from 18.0% at pH 6.4 to 41.9% at pH 5.0). zD values were 9.6, 9.0, and 8.4 degrees C for the 0-, 2,000-, and 4,000-IU/ml nisin treatments, respectively. Spores of B. licheniformis yielded results similar to those obtained with B. stearothermophilus. For example, decreasing CMMS (10 to 12% fat cocoa powder) pH values from 6.4 to 5.0 produced D100 degrees C values of 3.3, 2.8, and 2.8 min (pH 6.4) and 1.0, 0.8, and 0.8 min (pH 5.0) for the 0-, 2,000-, and 4,000-IU/ml nisin treatments. This study clearly verified that the addition of Nisaplin to dairy-based beverages, such as a chocolate milk drink, or other foods intended to be heated reduces the thermal resistance of selected bacterial spores. Increased spore sensitivity to heat may provide food processors with an opportunity to reduce their thermal processes and expenses while maintaining product quality, functionality, and shelf stability.
