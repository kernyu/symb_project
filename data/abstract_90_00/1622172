The effects of variations in renal perfusate flow on the excretion of cefonicid was examined in isolated perfused rat kidneys. Cefonicid, an expanded-spectrum cephalosporin, is primarily eliminated by active tubular secretion and is neither metabolized nor reabsorbed in the isolated kidney. We used angiotensin II (AII), a strong vasoconstrictor hormone of the afferent and the efferent arterioles in the kidney, to determine whether the renal and secretion clearances, as well as the excretion ratio (ER = CLR/[fu x GFR], where CLR is renal clearance, fu is the unbound fraction, and GFR is glomerular filtration rate), of this low-extraction compound can be altered by a decreased perfusion flow. Control studies were performed in the absence (n = 5) and presence (n = 4) of AII; cefonicid studies were performed in the absence (n = 4) and presence (n = 5) of AII. AII (1 to 4 ng/min) and cefonicid (5 to 10 micrograms/min) were infused into the perfusate. Cefonicid was assayed by high-performance liquid chromatography, and its protein binding was determined by ultrafiltration. AII decreased the perfusate flow rate and increased the renal vascular resistance and filtration fraction of the isolated kidney in the presence and absence of cefonicid. The glomerular filtration rate remained unchanged among the groups. The fractional excretion of glucose was low and steady, indicating a well-preserved tubular function. Although the unbound fraction was unchanged between treatments, the renal and secretion clearances and the excretion ratio of cefonicid were reduced by about 40% in the presence of AII (excretion ratios, 10.3 without AII versus 6.03 with AII). These results suggest that the altered clearance parameters of cefonicid are the result of a flow-induced change in the intrinsic secretory transport of the drug.
