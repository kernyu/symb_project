C57Bl/10 mice have a superior ability to control chronic infections with virulent strains of the intracellular bacteria Brucella abortus compared with BALB/c mice. While a number of differences in the cytokines produced by lymphocytes following infection of these two strains of mice have been shown, macrophages have not been evaluated for their role in conveying relative resistance. The importance of macrophages in control of brucella infections is demonstrated by the observations that intracellular survival of various strains of B. abortus directly correlates with their virulence in vivo, and the ability of macrophages to control brucellae in vitro has been shown to correlate with a brucella-resistant phenotype in ruminants. While both BALB/c and C57Bl are Nramp-susceptible mouse strains, additional differences in macrophage function outside of the Nramp1 gene effects could influence susceptibility to brucellosis. The studies conducted here comparing the ability of macrophages from C57Bl/10 and BALB/c mice indicate that the macrophages from resistant mice did not control intracellular growth of B. abortus strain 2308 more efficiently than those from the susceptible mice, either in the absence of, or following, interferon-gamma activation or iron supplementation. A number of different conditions for culturing macrophages were evaluated to rule out the influence of antibiotics on the conclusions drawn from the results.
