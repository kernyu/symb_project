As a first step toward developing the genetic potential of extremely thermophilic archaebacteria, mutant strains of Sulfolobus acidocaldarius were selected by plating cells directly on solid medium containing one of several growth inhibitors. Three spontaneous resistance phenotypes were observed (5-fluorouracil resistance, novobiocin resistance, and L-ethionine resistance), each at a different average frequency. Characterization of representative strains showed each of the three mutant phenotypes to provide a potentially useful genetic marker.
