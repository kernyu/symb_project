In order to determine the role of subinhibitory concentrations of antibiotics in resistance development, we performed an in vitro trial in which E. coli gained resistance after exposure to low concentrations of ampicillin in serial passages, while MIC values for amikacin and gentamicin increased 2 and 4 times, respectively. Pseudomonas also became resistant to ceftazidime whereas the MIC value for ciprofloxacin increased 10 times. There was not any significant change in susceptibility of S. aureus to vancomycin and amoxicillin + clavulanate.
