There has been little or no direct inquiry into the feasibility of nonbiological processes for attenuating alcohol effects. In an initial study, we found that an instructional Set (to concentrate) presented at each trial facilitated visual-motor performance among moderately intoxicated subjects. We extended this work in the present study by varying density of the Set presentation across trials, by varying Set onset and offset, and by assessing self-reported concentration levels. After dosing, subjects participated in two pairs of performance trials separated by a rest period. Six groups of subjects differed with respect to the number and sequence of Set presentations received across the postbeverage trials. We found that more Set presentations yielded better performance. Also, onset of Set presentation led to improved or sustained performance, whereas offset led to diminished performance. Finally, consistent with the possibility that concentration serves as a mediating variable, self-reported concentration correlated with performance. Implications of the obtained effects are discussed in the context of tolerance research and practical considerations.
