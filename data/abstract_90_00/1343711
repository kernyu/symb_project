With the use of a simple formulary, filled by health agents was established a monitoring programme for responses of P. falciparum to the antimalarial drugs. This monitoring programme is emphasized for the knowledge of the epidemiology of the drug resistance and the control of malaria falciparum in Amazon Basin where occurs more than 95% of Brazilian malaria cases every year. It was demonstrated that still now 4-aminoquinolines have a great importance for the mortality control in areas where just SUCAM (National Health Foundation--Health Ministry) agents are present without any medical assistance. The results obtained permitted the simplification of malaria treatment in Brazil. Important conclusions were established in the field of malaria drug resistance.
