In this study, we examined the levels of activated caspase-3 in the kainic acid (KA) model of hippocampal degeneration in both sensitive (FVB/N) and resistant (129/SvEMS) strains of mice. At 30 h, 2 and 4 days following KA administration, animals were sacrificed and brains examined for pyknosis, TUNEL labeling, and activated caspase-3 immunoreactivity. Catalytically active caspase-3 was first detected 30 h following KA treatment in the sensitive, FVB/N strain. This was 18 h before the appearance of pyknosis or TUNEL labeling. The expression of activated caspase-3 continues up to 4 days post-injection. No activated caspase-3 immunoreactivity was detected in the resistant, 129/SvEMS strain, neither was there evidence of pyknosis or TUNEL staining. This suggests that activation of caspase-3 is a necessary component of KA-induced cell death.
