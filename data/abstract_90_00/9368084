Teicoplanin, a glycopeptide, has been widely used in some nations alone and in empiric therapy combinations to address infections caused by Gram-positive cocci. However, glycopeptide resistance and the increasing incidence of oxacillin-resistant staphylococci have compromised contemporary chemotherapy. In this study, teicoplanin was tested in combinations with ampicillin, cefotaxime with and without desacetylcefotaxime, and ofloxacin against 151 Gram-positive cocci to assess the potential for enhanced action. The strains included recent isolates from the United States and Germany having well-characterized resistance mechanisms (oxacillin-resistant staphylococci, vancomycin-resistant enterococci), each tested by NCCLS methods, checkerboard synergy tests, and kill-curves. Teicoplanin alone was active (MIC90s, 0.25-2 micrograms/mL) against all species except vanA enterococci. Drug interactions of teicoplanin with beta-lactams revealed synergy and partial synergy versus oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus spp. (67-100%) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (70-100%), many at clinically achievable drug concentrations. However, confirming kill-curve experiments showed static action and no significant bactericidal effect. Combinations of ofloxacin with teicoplanin or cefotaxime plus desacetylcefotaxime showed a dominant additive and indifferent interaction. Teicoplanin continues to be a viable alternative to vancomycin, especially in combination therapy with selected broad-spectrum cephalosporins or fluoroquinolones. Many emerging pathogens that test resistant to individual drugs appear to be inhibited by tested combinations, extending their potential clinical utility.
