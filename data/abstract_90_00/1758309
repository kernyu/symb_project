The effect of Cd2+ on phosphate (Pi) uptake was investigated in the growing cells of Cd(2+)-resistant Staphylococcus aureus 1781OR and Cd(2+)-sensitive S. aureus 17810S. Inhibitor and ionophore studies showed that 32Pi uptake in the two strains occurred via the Pi porter down pH gradient (delta pH) generated by the respiratory chain. Cd2+ inhibited 32Pi uptake in the cadmium-sensitive strain 1781OS at all concentrations used (10 microM-1 mM). In strain 1781OR, possessing the plasmid-coded Cd2+ efflux system, 10-100 microM Cd2+ did not inhibit 32Pi uptake. Even at 1 mM Cd2+, inhibition of 32Pi uptake in strain 1781OR was reversed when the external Cd2+ was chelated with cysteine and activity of Cd2+ efflux system was restored. Cd2+ efflux induced by cysteine was energized either by membrane potential (delta psi) or by delta pH, which indicated that electrochemical gradient of protons (delta mu H+) was required for this efflux.
