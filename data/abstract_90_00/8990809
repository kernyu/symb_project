Mediastinitis after median stermotomy is a significant complication for a cardiovascular surgery. Prospective study of bacterial cultures of the anterior chest skin in cardiac and aortic surgery was performed with the comparison of two civilian hospitals. There were many ABPC-resistant bacteria including 26 to 67 percent of Staphylococcus epidermidis (SE). ABPC could not be chosen for the first drug of prophylaxis. Although there was a few CEZ-resistant SE, the efficacy of first-generation cephalosporins was acceptable in this series. If methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is detected in patient's preoperative bacterial cultures, vancomycin should be selected for prophylaxis. In patients with poor risk who required emergent cardiac surgery, combinational use of an first-generation cephalosporin and an amikacin or a minocycline should be recommended in our data.
