OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of an antibiotic prescribing programme in a intensive therapy unit. TYPE OF STUDY: Prospective comparative study. METHODS: We compared antibiotic prescriptions and bacterial susceptibility to antimicrobial agents before and after introduction of a programme focusing on injection control and therapeutic indications. RESULTS: The introduction of the programme resulted in a major decrease in antibiotic administration. Moreover, the susceptibility of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to ticarcillin increased from 40 to 68%, and susceptibility of Staphylococcus aureus to methicillin increased from 55 to 73%. CONCLUSIONS: Antibiotic control policies must be considered integral to any effort to decrease resistance and cost of therapy with antibiotics.
