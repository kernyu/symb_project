The in vitro interaction between five polycationic peptides, buforin II, cecropin P1, indolicidin, magainin II, and ranalexin, and several clinically used antimicrobial agents was evaluated against several clinical isolates of Gram-positive and Gram-negative aerobic bacteria, using the microbroth dilution method. The combination studies showed synergy between ranalexin and polymyxin E, doxycycline and clarithromycin. In addition, magainin II was shown to be synergic with betalactam antibiotics.
