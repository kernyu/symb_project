The efficacy of single dose treatment with trimethoprim compared to a 5-day course with the same drug was investigated in 100 children, 3-12 years, with isolated episodes of symptomatic non-febrile urinary tract infection. Cure, defined as sterile urine during the first week after treatment, was achieved in 74% (37/50) in the single dose group compared to 86% (43/50) in the 5-day treatment group. The difference was not statistically significant (chi 2 = 2.25, p = 0.134 two-tailed). The cure rates in relation to P-fimbriation of the infecting E. coli strains were similar in the two groups. During the 6 month follow-up, six children in each treatment group had one or more reinfections. Extended studies are needed to conclude if single dose and conventional treatment courses are equally effective.
