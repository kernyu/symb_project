Phenotypic analysis of vaccinia virus temperature-sensitive mutants identified several virus isolates that were either resistant or hypersensitive to rifampicin. Temperature-sensitive mutants 1085, 7743, 1085R, and 7743R were found to be rifampicin resistant (RifR). Each virus contained at least one mutation in ORF D13L which resulted in a change of amino acid sequence. Analysis of each point mutation by marker rescue demonstrated that mutations gly to asp at residue 80, pro to phe at 458, lys to asn at 484, and ile to val at 485 conferred the resistance phenotype, while the mutation changing ser to leu at 176 did not affect the rifampicin phenotype. Temperature-sensitive mutants C6, C17, and C43 were found to be rifampicin hypersensitive. Only C43, however, was found to contain a lesion in ORF D13L. This mutation, ser to asn at 169 was confirmed by marker rescue to confer the hypersensitive phenotype. The results presented here along with those from previous reports show that known mutations conferring rifampicin resistance cluster at the C or N-terminus of D13L while a mutation mapping at residue 169 confers rifampicin hypersensitivity. Further, the finding that the hypersensitive mutants C6 and C17 contain a wild-type D13L ORF suggests a possible role of other viral functions in the interaction of rifampicin with vaccinia virus.
