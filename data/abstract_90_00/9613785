We conducted a retrospective review of 125 patients undergoing high-dose therapy and stem cell rescue in order to evaluate the incidence of documented infection and the utility of the administration of vancomycin empirically. All patients received prophylactic oral quinolone therapy. Because neutropenia in this setting is relatively brief, 21 patients never manifested fever, and no patient died of infection. Of the remaining 104 patients, positive blood cultures were obtained in only 10, nine with a gram stain positive and one with a gram stain negative organism. Sixty-two patients without any evidence of gram positive infection received vancomycin according to the existing algorithm for care of neutropenic fevers. In this population of patients, empiric administration of vancomycin for neutropenic fevers without culture documentation appears to be unnecessary, could be discontinued safely and at substantial cost savings, and might slow the appearance of vancomycin-resistant organisms.
