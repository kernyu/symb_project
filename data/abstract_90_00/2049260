Twelve patients with acute uncomplicated falciparum malaria were admitted to the Hospital for Tropical Diseases for 42 days. The patients were treated with halofantrine 500 mg 6 hourly for three doses and halofantrine and its desbutyl metabolite were analysed in plasma by h.p.l.c. Cmax values of halofantrine and desbutylhalofantrine (n = 12) were 1192 +/- 410 (mean +/- s.d.) and 397 +/- 160 ng ml-1 with tmax values of 16 +/- 2 and 55 +/- 26 h, respectively. AUC was 60.6 +/- 23.9 and 48.5 +/- 22.2 mg l-1 h, respectively, for halofantrine and its metabolite. Halofantrine cured 83% of the patients but in two patients a reduction only in asexual parasitaemia was seen and no overall parasite clearance occurred. One of these, however had relatively low plasma concentrations of both halofantrine and its desbutyl metabolite and it appeared to be a case of inadequate treatment rather than true resistance. We suggest that the large intersubject variability in plasma drug concentrations may relate in part to its poor and inconsistent bioavailability and this rather than true resistance might be responsible for some of the treatment failures.
