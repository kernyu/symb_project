Susceptibility of 327 S. aureus strains isolated in 1988 from various materials obtained from patients hospitalized in various hospitals of Wroclaw city has been studied. Antibiograms were made by the use of diffusion-disc method for 21 antibiotics, including augmentin. Penicillin and oxytetracycline showed weak action on the strains studies; percentage of sensitive strains was 8.6% and 27.6%, respectively. Efficacious effects, more than 90% of strains, showed vancomycin, rifampicin, netilmicin, cefamandole++, amikacin and cefalotin. Susceptibility for augmentin was equal to 89.3%, and for other 12 antibiotics 50 to 89%. Multiresistant strains presented 19.6% of all specimen studied: large percentage of that strains was isolated from Department of Anesthesiology and Intensive Therapy (56.8%) and pediatry departments (26.4%). Most frequently they occur in the urine (33.3%). They showed high susceptibility to vancomycin (100%), rifampicin (98.4%), netilmicin (93.8%) and cefamandole++ (85.9%). Susceptibility to augmentin was 54.7%.
