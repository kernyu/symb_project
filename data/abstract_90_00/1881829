Pefloxacin, a 4-quinolone derivative, was administered in the dose of 800-1200 mg for the mean of 12 days to 24 patients with respiratory tract infection complicating chronic bronchial asthma or chronic obstructive lung disease. Patients with positive sputum culture and bacteria sensitive to pefloxacin were included in the study. Total eradication of the offending microorganisms was achieved in 54% of patients, and partial--in the next 20%. A poor efficacy of pefloxacin against Streptococcus species has been confirmed. In a few cases we have observed the development of resistance of isolated bacteria to pefloxacin during the course of treatment.
