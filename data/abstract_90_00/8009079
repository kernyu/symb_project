In an attempt to further characterize infections due to Xanthomonas maltophilia (XM), we reviewed 50 case reports observed in our institution. XM is emerging as an important nosocomial pathogen in immunocompromised patients, especially those receiving broad spectrum antimicrobial antibiotherapy. Distinction between colonisation and infection is often difficult. XM presents a therapeutic challenge because of its tendency to exhibit multiple resistance.
