A questionnaire survey to obtain information on endoparasite control practices and management on 68 Danish horse farms was undertaken in 1995. The study revealed that foals, young horses and adults were on average, annually treated 4.3, 4.0 and 3.7 times, respectively. The most commonly used drug from 1993-1995 was ivermectin. On average 2.4 different drugs were used annually. The most used method of weight estimation was eye measure: for foals by 78%, for youngsters by 81% and adults by 82% of the herd owners. The most commonly used weight in the dosing of anthelmintics was individual weights of the horse: 72% of the herd owners dosed their foals this way. 76% their youngsters and 75% their adults. Sixty two percent of the herd owners treated at turn out, 47% at housing, 57% treated when buying new horses, 26% treated when stabling visiting horses, 78% applied pasture change and 18% performed alternate/mixed grazing. Sixty one percent of the herds had experienced problems with diarrhoea and in 18% of the cases the suspected cause was considered to be endoparasites. 33% of the farms performed disease registration and on 25% Faecal Egg Count Reduction tests had been performed before entering this study. The herd owners obtained their formation about endoparasite control from veterinarians, meetings and papers in that order of importance.
