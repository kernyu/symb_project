Azithromycin was given to mice and humans infected with strains of Orientia tsutsugamushi from northern Thailand, where drug-resistant scrub typhus occurs. Azithromycin and doxycycline yielded comparable mouse survival rates (73 and 79%, respectively; P > 0.5). Symptoms, signs, and fever in two pregnant women abated rapidly with azithromycin. Prospective human trials are needed.
