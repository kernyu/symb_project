An evaluation of broth dilution antifungal susceptibility tests was performed by determining both the micro- and macrodilution MICs of amphotericin B, fluconazole, ketoconazole, 5-fluorocytosine, miconazole, and itraconazole against representative species of opportunistic hyphomycetes (Fusarium spp. and Cladosporium [Cladophialophora] spp.) and ascomycetes (Chaetomium spp.). A total of 78 strains were tested, the majority of them twice and some three times on different days. Both methods were performed according to the recommendations of the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (Document M27-P), with the exception of the temperature of incubation, which was 25 degrees C in our case. A spectrophotometric method for inoculum preparation, RPMI 1640 medium buffered with morpholinepropanesulfonic acid (pH 7.0), and an additive drug dilution procedure were used. The MICs obtained by the two methods were read after 48, 72, and 96 h of incubation for Fusarium spp. and after 72, 96, and 120 h for the remaining isolates. The kappa test was used to calculate the degree of agreement. Considering the three fungal groups together, a good agreement between the results of both tests was observed with almost all the drugs at the different incubation times. There were no cases of poor agreement. The highest level (kappa index = 1) was observed with ketoconazole at the second-day reading. These results support the further evaluation of the broth microdilution test as an alternative to the reference broth macrodilution susceptibility test.
