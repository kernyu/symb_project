72 S. typhi strains collected in Guangdong were tested for their Vi II phage types and their antimicrobial susceptibilities. The result of Vi II phage typing showed that 62 strains could be divided into definite types. The result of antimicrobial susceptibilities showed that, as national standard reference strains, all the 72 local strains were susceptible to choloramphenical, gentamycin, neomycin and polymycin B and were of different resistance to other 14 antimicrobial agents. The resistant profiles of strains isolated in different ages shared no significant difference. Choloramphenical remains Commonally selectable to treat Typhoid.
