Replication of several cryptic plasmids from coryneform strains was investigated in Brevibacterium sp. R312. Only the Corynebacterium glutamicum pSR1 replicon was found to be suitable for establishing a host-vector system. Two pSR1 derivatives, pRPCG200 and pHYCG1, were used as cloning vectors. They carry a neomycin-resistance-encoding and a tetracycline-resistance-encoding gene, respectively.
