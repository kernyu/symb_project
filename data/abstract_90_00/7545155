Molecular typing allowed the separation of the species Bacteroides fragilis into two genotypically distinct groups. A unique set of 50 strains of B. fragilis carrying the chromosomal metallo-beta-lactamase gene cfiA was subjected to a comparative analysis with respect to sets of up to 250 randomly collected strains devoid of this gene. The two groups were found to be distinct on the basis of the following results: (i) ribotyping, after DNA digestion with AvaI, revealed a practically homogeneous DNA fragment pattern for the cfiA-positive strains and distinct multiple patterns for the cfiA-negative strains; (ii) PCR, arbitrarily primed with an experimentally selected decamer, generated fragment patterns typical for the strains of each group; (iii) the three insertion sequences described to date in the species B. fragilis, i.e., IS4351, IS942, and IS1186, were all but confined to the cfiA-positive group, in which they were capable of providing promoter sequences for the transcription of cfiA; and (iv) the cepA gene, encoding the so-called endogenous cephalosporinase of B. fragilis, was found exclusively in the cfiA-negative group, in which it was present in ca. 70% of the strains. The cfiA-, cepA-negative fraction was not characterized further. In a natural population of 500 randomly selected strains of B. fragilis, the cfiA-positive and cfiA-negative groups represented ca. 3 and 97% of the strains, respectively. Analysis of 82 metabolic traits revealed no difference between the two groups.
