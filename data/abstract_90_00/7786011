The in vitro activity of a prototype 2-aryl carbapenem, L-695,256, against gram-positive bacteria was examined. All streptococci and oxacillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococci were inhibited at concentrations of < or = 0.125, < or = 0.125, and 4 micrograms/ml, respectively. The activity of L-695,256 was superior to that of imipenem against other organisms intrinsically resistant to beta-lactams.
