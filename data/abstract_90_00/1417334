The plasmid analysis of a collection of the staphylococci isolated was made in the obstetric hospitals of Nizhny Novgorod and Arzamas in 1986-1989. It revealed the presence of large complex plasmids with a molecular weight of 22 MD carrying the determinants of resistance to penicillins and cadmium and mercury ions in polyresistant strains. Conjugation transfer of the plasmid even between the staphylococci of different species was performed under experimental conditions. It was suggested that occurrence of the strains carrying the complex cadmium-penicillinase plasmid was due to violation of the sanitary or ecological requirements.
