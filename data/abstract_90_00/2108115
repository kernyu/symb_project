A Pseudomonas aeruginosa (isolate 416) from a patient with pneumonia, was initially susceptible to imipenem (MIC: 2 mg/l) but became resistant to this antibiotic (isolate 470, MIC: 32 mg/l) during imipenem therapy. Treatment failed. No parallel increases in MIC were observed for other antimicrobials tested. Isolates 416 and 470 shared the same pyocin type and serotype, produced small amounts of an inducible beta-lactamase, and had similar lipopolysaccharide compositions. On electrophoresis of outer membrane proteins, the porin F, identified by the monoclonal antibody MA4-4, was expressed similarly by the two isolates but the production of one band (apparent molecular weight: 47,000) was diminished in isolate 470. [14C]-Imipenem labelling of intact cells proceeded more slowly in 470 than in 416, especially when bacterial cells were treated by antibody MA4-4 to block the porin F channel. [14C]-Imipenem labelling of penicillin binding proteins (PBP) showed that the band identified as PBP-4 bound markedly less radioactivity in isolate 470 than in 416. After isolate 470 was passaged several times in antibiotic-free broth, the imipenem MIC was decreased from 32 to 8 mg/l, and the [14C]-imipenem PBP pattern recovered the initial profile as exhibited by isolate 416. Two resistance mechanisms, affecting imipenem electively, could have combined their effect in the post-therapy isolate, altered target protein and reduced permeability.
