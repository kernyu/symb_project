Two cases of critical nosocomial pneumonia caused by flavobacterium meningosepticum (FM) were reported and both of them were successfully cured. There were 2 other cases of FM pneumonia reported in Chinese literature previously, but none of them survived. It has been found that the treatment for FM respiratory infection was very difficult because of its resistance to majority of antibiotics, including the third generation cephalosporins. The symptoms of FM pneumonia are similar to those of other gram-negative bacillus pneumonias, such as Klebsiella pneumoniae pneumonia. Definite diagnosis depends principally on etiological examination and clinical manifestations of pneumonia. Cefoperazone, Cefsulodin, Astreonam and Ciprofloxacin are valuable drugs in saving the lives of patients with FM Pneumonia.
