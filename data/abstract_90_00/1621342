A microlarval development test for the detection of anthelmintic resistance in nematodes is described. Haemonchus contortus, Teladorsagia circumcincta and Trichostrongylus colubriformis eggs were cultured to third stage larvae in the presence of Earle's balanced salt solution, yeast extract and bacteria in a total volume of 150 microliters. Good dose-response data were obtained with thiabendazole, levamisole, pyrantel tartrate and ivermectin allowing the determination of the 50 per cent lethal concentration and of resistance factors when resistant strains were available. The test was found to be accurate, sensitive, easy to carry out and applicable to the routine detection of resistance.
