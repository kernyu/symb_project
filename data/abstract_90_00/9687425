Amphotericin B (AmB) has been used as a second-line treatment of visceral leishmaniasis, particularly in human immunodeficiency virus-positive patients. AmB median effective doses (ED50s) were determined on an isolate obtained before any treatment and on a second isolate obtained 4 years later from the same AmB-treated patient. ED50s were similar (0.059 and 0.067 mg/kg of body weight, respectively), demonstrating the first evidence of AmB ED50 stability of Leishmania infantum after a long-term drug exposure. An isoenzymatic study was performed in order to verify that the second isolate originated from the same parasite as the first isolate. The present case report showed that treatment failure was not due to parasite resistance in spite of a prolonged exposure to the drug.
