The influence of using ofloxacin in place of ciprofloxacin on hospital fluoroquinolone expenditures, total antimicrobial expenditures, and susceptibility of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to fluoroquinolones was studied. Hospitals with fluoroquinolone expenditures of at least $1 per occupied bed per year were administered annual surveys covering the years 1993 through 1996. The two most recent consecutive years of data were compared among hospitals that used ciprofloxacin as their primary fluoroquinolone during both years (group 1), hospitals whose ofloxacin purchases increased from accounting for < or =25% of total fluoroquinolone expenditures during year 1 to accounting for >25% during year 2 (group 2), and hospitals whose ofloxacin purchases accounted for at least 25% of total fluoroquinolone expenditures for both years (group 3). A total of 109 hospitals were included in the study. Most hospitals spent more on fluoroquinolones and total antimicrobials in year 2 than year 1. Group 3 hospitals had a significant increase in expenditures for fluoroquinolones and non-fluoroquinolone antipseudomonal antimicrobials. Group 2 hospitals did not realize antimicrobial cost savings and had higher rates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa resistance than hospitals that used ciprofloxacin. Whether a hospital changed its pattern of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin purchasing was not significantly associated with expenditures for fluoroquinolones, nonfluoroquinolone antimicrobial agents, or all antimicrobials. Susceptibility of P. aeruginosa to ciprofloxacin was lower in hospitals with greater proportions of ofloxacin use. Individual hospital, ciprofloxacin expenditures, and study year were found to be predictive of P. aeruginosa susceptibility to ciprofloxacin among all pooled hospitals.
