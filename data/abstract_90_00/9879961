The composite transposon Tn4001 and a related chromosomal Tn4001-like element, encode resistance to the aminoglycosides gentamicin, tobramycin and kanamycin (GmTmKmr) in Australian strains of Staphylococcus aureus. Southern hybridisation analysis of GmTmKmr S. aureus strains isolated from various hospitals in the UK between 1975 and 1985 indicated that they predominantly encoded chromosomal copies of Tn4001 or a Tn4001-like element. However, a strain isolated in 1985 was found to carry Tn4001 on a plasmid related to pSK1, the prototypical multiresistance plasmid commonly detected in S. aureus strains from Australian hospitals.
