Ninety nine patients with 101 bacteraemic episodes due to Ps. aeruginosa (PA) within 6 years were divided into two groups according to their resistance to imipenem-91 due to imipenem sensitive (ISPA) and 10 due to resistant (IRPA). Risk factors, the clinical course and the outcome were evaluated and compared. Acute leukaemia, prolonged neutropenia, previous therapy with amikacin, third generation of cephalosporins, imipenem and prophylaxis by quinolones were significantly more frequently associated with IRPA. Imipenem resistant PA bacteraemia were associated with higher incidence of septic shock (40% vs 19.8%, p < 0.02) and death (33.3%) than ISPA bacteraemias. Since 1992, when first IRPA appeared, the incidence of imipenem resistance increased tenfold, and in 1994, up to 10% of PA causing bloodstream infections in cancer patients in our center were imipenem resistant.
