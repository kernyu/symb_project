MxA is an abundant and ubiquitous cytoplasmic protein induced by alpha/beta interferon in human cells. Upon full induction, it can constitute 0.5 to 1% of cytosolic proteins. MxA can bind elements of the cytoskeleton, such as actin and tubulins, and several larger cellular proteins. However, these protein-protein interactions seem to be transitory. The human MxA protein contains a tripartite GTP-binding domain consisting of GxxxxGKS, DxxG, and TKxD, where x is any amino acid. It is shown here that the native MxA protein has GTPase activity (GTP----GDP) when purified by immunoprecipitation with affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies directed against the C-terminal domain of MxA. The GTPase activity is greatly diminished by polyclonal antibodies directed against the N-terminal domain of MxA (the domain which contains the GTP-binding consensus elements). Amino acid substitution within the GTP-binding domain abolished the GTPase activity of the mutated MxA protein expressed in transfected CHO cells. The reaction is specific for GTP, and the approximate Km is 0.1 mM. The reaction has an absolute requirement for Mg2+. The turnover number is approximately 70 molecules of GTP hydrolyzed per min per MxA molecule. It is suggested that the human MxA protein has certain characteristics of the stress proteins.
