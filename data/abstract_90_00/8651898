There is a great demand for an applicable vaccine against bacterial infections of prawns, especially Vibriosis. The results of the tests that had been carried out can be evaluated as promising and indicate that the vaccination of prawns against bacterial diseases is possible. Nevertheless it is still necessary to increase the scale of research on this subject, above all, the basics of the immuno-system of prawns. Adult prawns should be vaccinated to check if they are able to pass their immuno-protection to their progeny. If that is the case only a few breeding animals have to be vaccinated, instead of all the larvae. Actually the prophylactic application of antibiotics is the only method to prevent infections with Vibriosis. 100-150 mg of Oxytetracycline per kg of prawns are fed during one production period and these antibiotics are also used in humans. Assuming that the average amount of harvested prawns per production unit is 8-10 metric tons/pond (1 ha). 800-1500 g of antibiotics are used. Since different pathogenic strains have developed resistance to Oxytetracycline, also other kinds of antibiotics (for example oxolinic acid) are given today. Antibiotics are often fed until harvesting, however, there are laws which prohibit use to antibiotics during the last thirty days before harvesting, to prevent residues in the prawn body. A vaccine against bacterial diseases could decrease the production costs and reduce the amount of the applied antibiotics.
