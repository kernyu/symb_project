The role of endogenous IL-4 in resistance to Listeria monocytogenes infection was investigated by in vivo administration of an anti-IL-4 mAb (11B11). Mice treated with 0.01 to 0.4 mg of anti-IL-4 mAb before L. monocytogenes challenge demonstrated a significantly reduced peak bacterial burden in their livers and spleens and accelerated bacterial clearance from these organs. In addition, histopathologic damage to the liver was reduced. Maximal protection was achieved by i.p. injection of 0.1 mg of anti-IL-4 mAb 2 or 24 h before L. monocytogenes challenge; treatment with anti-IL-4 mAb after injection of L. monocytogenes had no effect on antilisterial resistance. Anti-IL-4 mAb-treated and control Listeria-infected mice exhibited similar patterns of IFN-gamma, IL-2, and IL-4 mRNA, as determined by polymerase chain reaction amplification of RNA extracted from spleen cells. In both anti-IL-4 mAb-treated and control mice, IFN-gamma, IL-2, and IL-4 mRNA were produced within 4 h after challenge. Cytokine mRNA levels were similar for anti-IL-4 mAb-treated and control mice, except for the greater amount of IFN-gamma mRNA in the anti-IL-4 mAb-treated mice at 4 h after L. monocytogenes challenge. IFN-gamma and IL-2 mRNA levels were sustained for at least 5 days, whereas IL-4 mRNA was undetectable by 3 days after challenge. There were no significant differences in the amounts of IL-4 and IFN-gamma detected in culture supernatants of spleen cells from anti-IL-4 mAb-treated and control Listeria-infected mice. These results suggest that endogenous IL-4, a cytokine thought to be produced principally by Th2 cells, has a deleterious effect on host defense against the facultative intracellular pathogen L. monocytogenes. Administration of an anti-IL-4 mAb increases antilisterial resistance without causing a detectable shift to a Th1 type of cytokine response.
