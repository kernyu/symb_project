Lines of Oesophagostomum dentatum artificially selected or not selected for resistance to pyrantel, levamisole and ivermectin were used in this study. From the 10th generation of selection eggs were collected from each line and subjected to an in vitro larval development assay (LDA) and an egg hatch assay (EHPA). Significant differences were observed between an unselected line of O. dentatum and the lines selected for resistance to levamisole or pyrantel in both assays. The LDA was more sensitive than EHPA in detecting anthelmintic resistance in O. dentatum. The results obtained from the LDA confirmed side-resistance between levamisole and morantel/pyrantel. The in vitro tests failed to show significant differences between ivermectin-sensitive and resistant lines.
