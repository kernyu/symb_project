100 strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa were isolated from June, 1986 to Sept. 1989. Results of antibiotic susceptibility test indicated that resistance to convenient antibiotics was serious. Minimum inhibitory concentration showed pseudomonas aeruginosa was more susceptible to ceftazidime, norfloxacin and amikacin. Typing investigation indicated that pseudomonas aeruginosa infection in this burn ward was mainly serotype P 11, cross-infection was existent, so isolation measure should be strengthened.
