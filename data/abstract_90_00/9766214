In Kluyveromyces lactis, the cell wall compositions of Kl (ATCC 96897), a wild sensitive strain, and Klm (ATCC 96896), a strain resistant to amphotericin B (AmB), were shown to be very different, since the walls in the latter were significantly enriched in hexosamine, but had a reduced content in phosphate and amino acid. In both strains, the cell walls limited their sensitivity to this antifungal agent. The absence of cell wall increased the sensitivity of the cells to this polyene by 5 to 10-fold. When the cells were treated with enzymes such as pronase and chitinase in order to change the cell wall structure just before inoculation, the yeasts appeared more resistant to the antibiotic. However, treatments with chymopapain and phospholipase C did not significantly change the sensitivity of the two strains to this agent. Cells treated with acid phosphatase displayed a longer lag phase than the control cells. In addition, when cultured in the presence of AmB, the cells were less sensitive to this agent. The present results reveal that both a change in the ionic charges of the cell wall and an alteration in the cell wall structure modified the sensitivity of these yeast strains to AmB.
