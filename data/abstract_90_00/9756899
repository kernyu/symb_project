beta-Lactamases inactivate beta-lactam antibiotics by catalyzing the hydrolysis of the amide bond in the beta-lactam ring. The plasmid-encoded class A TEM-1 beta-lactamase is a commonly encountered beta-lactamase. It is able to inactivate penicillins and cephalosporins but not extended-spectrum antibiotics. However, TEM-1-derived natural variants containing the G238S amino acid substitution display increased hydrolysis of extended-spectrum antibiotics. Two models have been proposed to explain the role of the G238S substitution in hydrolysis of extended-spectrum antibiotics. The first proposes a direct hydrogen bond of the Ser238 side chain to the oxime group of extended-spectrum antibiotics. The second proposes that steric conflict with surrounding residues, due to increased side chain volume, leads to a more accessible active site pocket. To assess the validity of each model, TEM-1 mutants with amino acids substitutions of Ala, Ser, Cys, Thr, Asn, and Val have been constructed. Kinetic analysis of these enzymes with penicillins and cephalosporins suggests that a hydrogen bond is necessary but not sufficient to achieve the hydrolytic activity of the G238S enzyme for the extended-spectrum antibiotics cefotaxime and ceftazidime. In addition, it appears that the new hydrogen bond interaction is to a site on the enzyme rather than directly to the extended-spectrum antibiotic. The data indicate that, for the G238S substitution, a combination of an optimal side chain volume and hydrogen bonding potential results in the most versatile and advantageous antibiotic hydrolytic spectrum for bacterial resistance to extended-spectrum antibiotics.
