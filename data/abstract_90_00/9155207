Growth of verotoxin-producing Escherichia coli (VTEC) O157 in conventionally recommended pre-enrichment broth media at different temperatures was evaluated. In addition, sensitivity of VTEC O157 isolates to several antibacterial drugs, which were added to the selective enrichment broth, was tested. All five isolates of VTEC O157 tested grew well in trypticase soy broth (TSB) at 36 degrees C and 42 degrees C, while the growth of one isolate was markedly suppressed in TSB supplemented with cefixime (CFIX), potassium tellurite (PT), and vancomycin (TSB-CTV) even at 36 degrees C. A significant growth suppression was also observed in three of the isolates cultured in novobiocin (NB)-supplemented modified EC broth (mEC-NB) at 42 degrees C. In mEC-NB after 24-hr incubation at 36 degrees C, the five VTEC O157 isolates grew well, although one isolate was slightly suppressed during the first 8 hours. Minimum growth inhibitory concentrations of CFIX, NB and PT for a total of 90 clinical and environmental isolates of VTEC O157 were all above the concentrations usually prescribed for mEC-NB and TSB-CTV. These findings suggest that mEC-NB and TSB-CTV should be used at 36 degrees C for growth of VTEC O157 and that use of a nonselective pre-enrichment broth medium (i.e. TSB) together with a selective one (i.e. TSB-CTV or mEC-NB) is necessary for successful isolation of VTEC O157 from various specimens.
