The in vitro activity of nine fluoroquinolones against 200 recent clinical isolates of enterococci was evaluated. The relative activity was WIN57273 > sparfloxacin > ciprofloxacin, temafloxacin > ofloxacin > fleroxacin, lomefloxacin, norfloxacin > enoxacin. Susceptibility to gentamicin or streptomycin did not influence the activity of the fluoroquinolones.
