Clinafloxacin was significantly more active against fluoroquinolone-resistant organisms than ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, sparfloxacin and fleroxacin. Clinafloxacin inhibited 65% of isolates at the recommended breakpoint (< or = 1 mg/L) compared with only 30.0% for ciprofloxacin, 31.7% for ofloxacin, 32% for fleroxacin, and 37.7% for sparfloxacin at their recommended breakpoints. No strain susceptible to ciprofloxacin was resistant to the other compounds tested.
