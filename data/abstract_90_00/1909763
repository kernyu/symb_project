Fleroxacin (FLRX), a new quinolone oral antibacterial agent, was studied in the field of obstetrics and gynecology, and the following results were obtained. 1. Clinical efficacy was evaluated in 105 patients (intrauterine infection 38, adnexitis 28, extragenital organ infection 29, others 10), with an exclusion of 9 patients out of a total of 114 patients. FLRX was orally administered at 200 mg or 300 mg once daily. 2. Clinical efficacy rates were 37/38 (97.4%) in intrauterine infection, 26/28 (92.9%) in adnexitis, 29/29 (100%) in extragenital organ infection and 10/10 (100%) in others. 3. Efficacy rates classified by isolated organisms were 23/23 (100%) in single infections by Gram-positive organisms, 11/13 (84.6%) in those by Gram-negative organisms, 8/9 (88.9%) in those by anaerobic organisms and 15/19 (78.9%) in mixed infections. 4. Side effects were observed in 4 cases (3.5%); gastrointestinal disorder with diarrhea and diarrhea in 1 patient each and insomnia in 2 patients. In laboratory examination, eosinophilia and elevation of GOT and GPT were noted in 1 patient each (1.9%). Based on the above results, we consider that FLRX is a useful drug for the obstetrical and gynecological infections.
