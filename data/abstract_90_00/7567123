Antibiotic susceptibility of 948 bacterial strains isolated from varied samples essentially proceeding from urinary infections in five Paris psychiatric Hospitals was determined by disk diffusion method. E. coli, P. mirabilis, Klebsiella spp., P. aeruginosa et S. aureus are the predominant bacteria. 40% of S. aureus are methicilline resistant. Enterobacteriaceae are progressively becoming resistant to aminopenicillines, but remain sensitive to third generation cephalosporines. They are still susceptible to first generation quinolones. At least, if no resistance of P. aeruginosa to imipeneme has been reported, 30% of strains are resistant to ciprofloxacine. Resistance phenotypes to antibiotics of the strains isolated in patients from psychiatric Hospitals are located between those observed in out patients and in patients from general Hospitals. However, we noticed a worrying evolution of resistance to those encontered in psychiatric Hospitals. Therefore, a multiresistant strains emergence monitoring must be carried out regulary.
