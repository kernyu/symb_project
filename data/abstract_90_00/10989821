The increase in serious gram-positive infections has increased the need for treatment of gram-positive infections in patients with hematologic malignancies. Common gram-positive pathogens exhibit a variety of resistance mechanisms, and this has supported the need for new antibiotics with unique modes of action and no endogenous resistance mechanism(s) directed against them. Linezolid (Zyvox), the first member of the oxazolidinone class of antibiotics to be tested clinically, is such an antibiotic. Linezolid has been shown to be effective against key gram-positive pathogens in vitro, without evidence of resistance development or cross-resistance to other antibiotics. Its efficacy and safety in the treatment of non-immunocompromised patients with hospital- and community-acquired pneumonia and skin and soft-tissue infections have been found to be comparable to commonly used present-day antibiotics. It has also been shown to be effective against vancomycin-resistant enterococci and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Linezolid has a wide gram-positive spectrum of activity and is amenable to oral or parenteral administration These attributes make it potentially useful for continuing outpatient therapy that was initiated for inpatients.
