SUP35 and SUP45 genes determine the accuracy of translation at the stage of termination. We present indirect evidence indicating that these genes may also control some cellular process mediated by microtubules. A majority of sup35 and sup45 suppressor mutations confer supersensitivity to benomyl, the drug which de-polymerizes microtubules. In addition, data correlating phenotypic manifestations of sup45 suppressor mutations, involving sensitivity to benomyl, respiratory deficiency and a suppressor effect, are also presented.
