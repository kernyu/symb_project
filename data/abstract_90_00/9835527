Ninety-four erythromycin-susceptible and 107 erythromycin-resistant enterococcal strains (MIC of >/=512 microgram/ml) were inhibited by the ketolide HMR3647 at MICs of </=0.007 to 0.06 and 0.03 to 8 microgram/ml, respectively. Eighteen vanA-positive isolates and 29 high-level-penicillin-resistant isolates, all of them erythromycin resistant, were inhibited by HMR3647 at an MIC range of 0.015 to 4 microgram/ml. The new ketolide has excellent activity against Enterococcus species.
