The modulation of cisPlatin cytotoxicity by interleukin-1 (IL-1 alpha) was studied in cultures of SCC-7 tumor cells with and without tumor macrophages to examine potential mechanisms for the synergistic antitumor activity of cisPlatin and IL-1 alpha in SCC-7 solid tumors. Neither IL-1 alpha nor tumor macrophages affected the survival of clonogenic tumor cells and IL-1 alpha had no direct effect on tumor cell growth in vitro. Macrophages had no direct effect on cisPlatin sensitivity (IC90 = 6.0 microM), but, the addition of IL-1 alpha (500-2000U/ml) to co-cultures of cisPlatin pretreated tumor cells and resident tumor macrophages increased cell killing (IC90 = 3.1 microM). Similar responses were seen in primary cultures treated with cisPlatin before IL-1 alpha. The modulation of cisPlatin cytotoxicity by IL-1 alpha exhibited a biphasic dose response that paralleled the IL-1 alpha dose dependent release of H2O2 by resident tumor macrophages. Further, IL-1 alpha modification of cisPlatin cytotoxicity was prompt and inhibited by catalase. CisPlatin and exogenous H2O2 (50 microM) produced more than additive SCC-7 clonogenic cell kill and hydroxyl radicals played an important role in the response. Interleukin-1 modulation of cisPlatin cytotoxicity was schedule dependent. IL-1 alpha treatment for 24 hrs, before cisPlatin, produced drug resistance (IC90 = 11.1 microM). Our study shows that IL-1 alpha can stimulate tumor macrophages to release pro-oxidants that modify cellular chemosensitivity in a schedule and dose dependent fashion. Our findings may also provide a mechanistic explantation for the synergistic antitumor activity of cisPlatin and IL-1 alpha in vivo.
