Streptococcus pneumoniae is uniquely sensitive to quinine and its derivatives, but only those alkaloids having antimalarial properties, i.e., those in the erythro configuration, also possess antipneumococcal activity. Quinine and related compounds inhibit the pneumococcal H+ -ATPase. Quinine- and optochin-resistant pneumococci showed mutations that change amino acid residues located in one of the two transmembrane alpha-helices of the c subunit of the F0F1, H+ -ATPase.
