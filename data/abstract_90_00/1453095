Tuberculosis is making a comeback in communities across the nation. Increased rates of the disease, particularly with those having HIV/AIDS, have sounded the alarm that quick and decisive action is needed to halt the spread of TB. Multidrug-resistant TB is becoming a primary concern with public health officials. Specific plans and efforts, instigated by the Centers for Disease Control, have outlined the appropriate steps local public health workers, the medical community, and civic and community organizations should take in order to eliminate TB by the year 2010. With the creation of the Task Force on Drug Resistant Tuberculosis, Louisiana has a vehicle with which to combat its growing TB problem.
