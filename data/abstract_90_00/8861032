A colony (N83) of the vaccine strain of Francisella tularensis (15/10) and a strain (N268) isolated from a water sample in nature were revealed for susceptibility to cultivation at 42 degrees C. Both strains had low virulence for white mice and were avirulent for guinea pigs but possessed high immunogenicity in these animals. The spontaneous mutant of vaccine strain 15/10 showed resistance to doxicycline and rifampicine (15/10 Dox (r)40 Rif (r)40). The obtained mutant had biological characteristics similar to the parent vaccine strain. It provided immunity in experimental animals when vaccination and antimicrobial agents were used in combination.
