OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the in-vitro resistance of a pericardial tissue bioprothesis as well as its use for the reconstruction of surgical defects in the thoracoabdominal wall. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The prosthesis were preserved for 15 days in different concentrations of glutaraldehyde (0.5% to 10%). Normal saline and Hanks solution were used as controls. Tensile strength and percent elongation were measured using an Instrom 1011 automatic equipment; polypropilene (Marlex) and polyester (Mersilene) mesh samples were included. Also, the 0.5% glutaraldehyde-preserved pericardium was used to repair defects experimentally produced in the abdominal wall (n = 12), chest wall (n = 6), diaphragm (n = 6), and sternum (n = 7) of mongrel dogs. RESULTS: The samples preserved in 0.5% glutaraldehyde showed a significantly higher tensile strength (11.7 N/mm2, SEM = 0.8) than samples preserved in other concentrations as well as in the mesh samples. Percent elongation in 0.5% glutaraldehyde was 56% (SEM = 5.8) which was similar to the meshes' elongation but significantly lower than that seen for the 1%, 2.5% and 5% glutaraldehyde-preserved samples. The dogs showed good tolerance to the 0.5% preparation and the histopathology showed formation of a fibroblast layer with collagen deposits and development of scar tissue. There was no case of infection or rejection in the animals, and all the microbiological cultures of the preparations were negative. CONCLUSION: Pericardial bioprothesis is a resistant material which can be used surgically in the repair of thoracoabdominal defects.
