The minimal inhibitory concentrations of 39 antimicrobial agents for 54 isolates of Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis in vitro have been determined. The most active agents were penicillins, macrolides, tetracyclines, cephalosporins, lincomycin, chloramphenicol, and rifampicin. Most isolates were resistant to aminoglycosides, nitrofurans, polymyxins, nalidixic acid, and cycloheximide.
