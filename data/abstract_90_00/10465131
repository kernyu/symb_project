Infectious complications still represent a major problem in patients submitted to bone marrow transplant (BMT); approximately 40% of febrile episodes are associated with infection and one-third of these are bacteremias. Opinions about the best appropriate empiric regimens are based on evaluation of cost, potential for adverse side-effects, development of bacterial resistance, prevalent nosocomial infections. In order to assess the clinical and microbiological effectiveness of an aggressive approach, we performed a prospective open study in 72 neutropenic febrile BMT patients, employing a triple antibiotic association including amikacin 500 mg x 8h, ceftazidime 2 g x 8 h, vancomycin 500 mg x 8 h as first-line empiric treatment. For the purpose of this study, a lasting return of temperature to normal and complete disappearance of either clinical or bacteriological signs of infection without any modification of therapy was considered as success; the persistence of fever after 72 hours or a protocol change was considered as failure. Eighty episodes were enrolled during the course of the study; bacteriological evidence of infection was obtained in 23 (28.7%) febrile episodes. Median duration of antibiotic administration and of febrile episodes were 5 and 2 days respectively. Overall response rate based on clinical responses was 87% and 91% in microbiological documented infections. Death due to sepsis nor toxicity were observed. This triple antibiotic combination appears to be a very effective regimen for the empiric treatment of febrile episodes in severely neutropenic BMT recipients.
