In recent years, isolation rate of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has decreased, while the rate of Pseudomonas aeruginosa has increased. This phenomenon may be a result of regulation of use of antibiotics which belongs to the third cephems and extensive preventive measures against hospital acquired infections due to MRSA. Based on our investigation in which we determined MICs of various antibiotics against P. aeruginosa strains isolated from inpatients, the antibacterial activities of cefclidin (CFCL) was superior to those of other antibiotics. The antibacterial activity of CFCL against P. aeruginosa tested was similar to or stronger than that of tobramycin.
