In vitro anti-leprosy activities of various antimicrobials were measured by using the BACTEC 460 TB System. The Growth Index reducing activities of test drugs were strong in clofazimine, KRM-1648, rifabutin, clarithromycin and rifampicin; intermediate in sparfloxacin, minocycline and ofloxacin; and weak in ciprofloxacin, fleroxacin and DDS. Amikacin, pipemidic acid, enoxacin and norfloxacin had no such in vitro activities. There is a close correlation between in vitro and in vivo anti-M. leprae activities of a given agent, therefore indicating usefulness of the BACTEC 460 TB System in evaluation of in vitro anti-M. leprae activity of a given agent.
