The purpose of this study was to determine if patients with high vancomycin (VAN) serum levels experience more toxicity than underdosed patients with lower (VAN) levels, and whether low VAN serum levels cause therapeutic failures in patients with gram-positive bacteremia. In 198 cancer patients trough and peak serum levels of VAN were measured. Acute toxicity (Red Man syndrome) appeared in 3 patients (1.5%). Patients previously or currently treated with other nephrotoxic compounds (134 patients) presented the same incidence of nephrotoxicity as those receiving VAN for the first time in monotherapy (64 patients). VAN did not increase the toxicity when patients were dosed simultaneously or previously with aminoglycosides or amphotericin B. Our second observation, when studying serum levels in our 198 patients was that high VAN trough serum levels (trough > 15 microg/mL) were associated with significantly more nephrotoxicity (33.3% vs. 11.1%, P < 0.03) than low levels in the subgroups of either pretreated patients or unpretreated with other nephrotoxic drugs. None of 198 patients who had trough levels below 15 microg/mL had peak levels exceeding 40 microg/mL. This suggests that only serum monitoring of trough levels may predict nephrotoxicity. A case control study was conducted to compare a group of 22 VAN failures with 22 successfully treated patients matched in underlying disease and neutropenia who were treated in the same period, under the same antibiotic policy, at the same cancer center, for gram-positive bacteremia. Persisting, enterococcal, or mixed enterococcal plus staphylococcal bacteremia were the only statistically significant risk factors which predicted therapy failure in cancer patients. Neither peak nor trough VAN serum levels predicted failure or cure of gram-positive bacteremia in cancer patients.
