Susceptibility and resistance to experimental Leishmania major (L. major) infection in mice are associated with a Th2- or Th1-type response, respectively. We have previously shown that immunological events occurring within the first 24 h after infection in the lymph node (LN) draining the site of parasite challenge are critical for the development of either type of T-cell responses. In the present study we manipulated these events by preventing the entry of naive lymphocytes into the draining LN by injecting BALB/c mice with a single dose of the anti-L-selectin mAb MEL-14 one day prior to infection with L. major. In contrast to control BALB/c mice, in MEL-14 treated animals the primary lesion healed 12 weeks after infection. The parasite load in the spleen and lymph nodes of MEL-14 treated mice was significantly reduced. The healing was found to be associated with an increased production of IFN-gamma and with a decrease in IL-4 production by LN cells. We observed a dramatic decrease in cellularity in the draining LN in Mel-14 treated L. major-infected mice within the first week of infection. Moreover, the cells in the LN of MEL-14 treated mice were highly enriched in activated cells as well as in cell influx in the draining LN after local L. major infection of BALB/c mice prevents fatal disease. The data suggest the MEL-14-induced enrichment of the draining LN in memory and activated cells is fundamental for the initiation of a protective Th1-type response.
