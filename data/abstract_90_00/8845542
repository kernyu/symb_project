OBJECTIVE: To update readers on the significant changes in infectious diseases pharmacotherapy. DATA SOURCES: An Index Medicus and Iowa Drug Information Service search (1993-1994) of English-language literature pertaining to the selected topic areas was performed. Additional information from abstracts presented at scientific meetings were identified by the authors. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: All identified studies were screened and those judged relevant to the update were evaluated. DATA SYNTHESIS: New or clinically significant data since 1992 that related to peptic ulcer disease, microbial resistance (e.g., Enterococcus spp., Streptococcus pneumoniae, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Candida albicans), immunomodulators, and AIDS were evaluated and compared with previous data. CONCLUSIONS: There have been several exciting and significant changes in infectious diseases pharmacotherapy evident from this review.
