The susceptibility of 140 Acinetobacter spp. isolated from blood cultures of patients from the Prince of Wales Hospital, Hong Kong, from 1990 to 1994 to 23 antimicrobial agents was studied by an agar dilution method. Resistance to most of the beta-lactams, aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones tested was high, being 11%-92%. Only amikacin, imipenem and meropenem were reliably active against this organism. Most of the isolates produced cephalosporinases with very high pIs while 33% produced beta-lactamases with pI ranges of 5.2-8.7.
