In order to explore the bactericidal activity of concentrations similar to the peak serum concentrations obtained after a single i.v. dose of 2,000/200 mg co-amoxiclav and 500 mg vancomycin, killing curves with co-amoxiclav (69/10 microg/ml), amoxicillin (69 microg/ml), clavulanic acid (10 microg/ml), and vancomycin (15 microg/ml) were performed against two isogenic (ss-lactamase positive and negative) methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains in cation-supplemented Mueller-Hinton broth with 2% NaCl incubated at 35 degrees C. Colony counts were performed at 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4 hours in Mueller- Hinton plates supplemented with 4% NaCl and 25 microg/ml oxacillin to measure the resistant population. Similar initial inocula reductions were obtained for amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and vancomycin for both strains, and significant differences were found in comparison to the control. Clavulanic acid decreased the growth rate of the ss-lactamase negative strain when compared to control curves. The penicillin-binding protein 2a affinity of old ss-lactams in conjunction with clavulanic acid overcoming ss-lactamase resistance may explain these results.
