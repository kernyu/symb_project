This study was designed to investigate whether antibiotic resistant micro-organisms are able to contaminate and survive on syringe tips used for subgingival deposition of antibiotics, and to test simple and effective means of disinfecting the syringe tip between applications. In the first part of the study, syringe tips used for application of Minocycline subgingival formula in 20 adult periodontitis patients were cultured for bacteria resistant to this drug before and after disinfecting them with ethanol. The results showed that 80% of the unwashed syringes were culture positive for minocycline resistant bacteria, whereas only 1 ethanol washed syringe tip was contaminated. In part II of the study, after dispensing minocycline periodontal formula in 20 patients, 10 of the syringe tips were washed with ethanol while 10 were left untreated. All syringes were stored in a refrigerator for 8 days, whereafter the tips were sampled for resistant bacteria. 20% of the unwashed tips were contaminated after 8 days incubation at 4 degrees C. None of the ethanol washed syringe tips were culture positive. We conclude that syringe tips may be contaminated with antibiotic resistant bacteria after dispensing the antibiotic in periodontal pockets. The transmission of these bacteria to other periodontal sites may be avoided by disinfecting the syringe tip with ethanol between applications. We have also shown that antibiotic resistant bacteria may survive on the syringe tip following 8 days storage in a refrigerator, suggesting that syringes used for subgingival deposition of an antibiotic should not be stored for reuse.
