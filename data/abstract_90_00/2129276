The study was done on 60 strains of Bacillus cereus isolated from cases of food poisoning and from food products tested in current supervision. The highest sensitivity was found to the antibiotics: streptomycin, neomycin, gentamicin, amikacin, oxytetracycline, and sulphonamides: negram and sulfathiazole . All strains were resistant to colistin and cloxacillin, nearly all were resistant to penicillin, ampicillin and optochine.
