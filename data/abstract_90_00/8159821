This study evaluates the sensitivity of P. falciparum in vitro to antimalarial drugs in an area of gold mining exploration in Amapa State during the period of 1983 to 1990. The following tests were done, 75 in vitro studies with chloroquine and quinine, 74 with amodiaquine and 76 with mefloquine. The results showed 81% of resistance to chloroquine and 27% to amodiaquine while resistant strains to quinine and mefloquine were found. Also for these two quinolinomethanols a loss of sensitivity was noticed in the period of study. An association between resistance to chloroquine and decrease of sensitivity to quinine was also evident with the same strains.
