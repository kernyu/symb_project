The cytotoxic drug tunicamycin kills cells because it is a specific inhibitor of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine:dolichol phosphate N-acetylglucosamine-1-P transferase (GPT), an enzyme that catalyzes the initial step of the biosynthesis of dolichol-linked oligosaccharides. In the presence of tunicamycin, asparagine-linked glycoproteins made in the endoplasmic reticulum are not glycosylated with N-linked glycans, and therefore may not fold correctly. Such proteins may be targeted for breakdown. Cells that are treated with tunicamycin normally experience an unfolded protein response and induce genes that encode endoplasmic reticulum chaperones such as the binding protein (BiP). We isolated a cDNA clone for Arabidopsis GPT and overexpressed it in Arabidopsis. The transgenic plants have a 10-fold higher level of GPT activity and are resistant to 1 microg/mL tunicamycin, a concentration that kills control plants. Transgenic plants grown in the presence of tunicamycin have N-glycosylated proteins and the drug does not induce BiP mRNA levels as it does in control plants. BiP mRNA levels are highly induced in both control and GPT-expressing plants by azetidine-2-carboxylate. These observations suggest that excess GPT activity obviates the normal unfolded protein response that cells experience when exposed to tunicamycin.
