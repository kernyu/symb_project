Plasmids carrying type I or II sulfonamide-resistance (Sur) genes were evaluated for their effect on synergy between trimethoprim (Tmp) and sulfamethoxyzole (Smx) in E. coli. Strain J53 containing each of three plasmids (R1, pSa, and R388) with the type I Sur gene displayed a synergistic response to Tmp/Smx; strain LE392 containing a plasmid (RSF1010) with the type II Sur gene displayed no synergy. The difference in synergy between type I and type II Sur genes might be explained by the difference in amount of resistant enzyme produced.
