Since pesticides have been shown to interact with P-glycoprotein (P-gp), the purpose of this study was to examine the possible role of P-gp in pesticide resistance in the tobacco budworm (Heliothis virescens). Using three P-gp antibodies, P-gp expression in various resistant populations of tobacco budworms was found to be 2-6-times that of the susceptible larvae. Tobacco budworm P-gp was glycosylated and localized primarily in the cuticle and fat body with little expression in the mid gut. To determine the role of P-gp in pesticide resistance, resistant tobacco budworm larvae were treated with a P-gp inhibitor, quinidine, and challenged with various doses of thiodicarb. Inhibition of P-gp decreased the LD50 for thiodicarb by a factor of 12.5. Quinidine treatment did not result in a significant inhibition of the P-450 system nor did it alter the feeding of the larvae, suggesting the potential involvement of P-gp in pesticide resistance. An age-dependent increase in P-gp expression was detected in resistant larvae as compared to control, susceptible larvae. This correlates with the reported age-dependent increase in resistance and is further evidence supporting the role of P-gp in the development of pesticide resistance.
