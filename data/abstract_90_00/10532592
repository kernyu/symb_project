P-glycoprotein (Pgp), the product of the multidrug resistance (MDR1) gene, is expressed in a variety of normal tissues but very little is known about its expression and function in cells of the immune system. In this study, we investigated the effect of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) on the expression and activity of Pgp in human peripheral blood monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM). We report that IFN-gamma up-regulated Pgp expression in a dose- and time-dependent manner. We show that IFN-gamma slightly increased the accumulation of MDR1 mRNA and induced a polarized redistribution of Pgp, as well as of some cytoskeletal proteins (ie, ezrin, actin, and alpha-actinin) on cell pseudopodia. Notably, confocal microscopy studies showed that Pgp and ezrin colocalized in these cellular structures. The IFN-gamma-induced Pgp up-modulation was a specific response of primary macrophages, as IFN-gamma treatment of primary lymphocytes and monocytic cell lines did not result in any increase of Pgp expression. Finally, IFN-gamma stimulated the Pgp transport activity in MDM, as rhodamine 123-efflux increased in treated cells as compared with control cultures. These results indicate that Pgp expression and activity can be up-regulated in human MDM in response to IFN-gamma. We suggest that IFN-gamma may be involved in the induction of multidrug resistance in macrophages.
