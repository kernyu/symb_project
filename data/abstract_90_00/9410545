In a retrospective study, we registered 210 patients hospitalized in Strasbourg for malaria from 1984 to 1995. The diagnosis was always confirmed by presence of the parasite on blood smears. We analysed the epidemiological, clinical, biological and therapeutic data. The number of cases rose each year, with a maximum in 1995. The majority of cases occurred in January and from August to October, these periods corresponding with the return of travelers. In most cases, infection took place in Africa. In this region, Plasmodium falciparum is the most frequent species of the parasite. The mean age of the patients was 33 years. The clinical manifestations were polymorphic: fever, chills, sweating, and headache were very frequent. We noted 15 serious infections (with the WHO's definition) and two cases of cerebral malaria. All cases had a favorable outcome. Five cases occurred in pregnant women; two of them had a severe form of malaria. Among the biological abnormalities, we found thrombopenia, haemolysis, hypocholesterolaemia and hypertriglyceridaemia. The significance of disturbance of the lipid metabolism is not known. Hypocholesterolaemia is very frequent, and hypertriglyceridaemia seems to be associated with severe malaria. Most malaria attacks occurred in patients without adequate chemoprophylaxis. This confirms the importance of prophylactic information given to patients by their physicians. Resistance develops against each new medication that is available; among these quinine remains the drug of choice to cure severe malaria.
