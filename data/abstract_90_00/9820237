This reports the synthesis and in vitro antimicrobial properties of a series of 2-thioether-linked quinolonyl-carbapenems. Although the title compounds exhibited broad spectrum activity, the MICs were generally higher than those observed for selected benchmark carbapenems, quinolonyl-penems, and quinolones. Enzyme assays suggested that the title compounds are potent inhibitors of penicillin binding proteins and inefficient inhibitors of bacterial DNA-gyrase. Uptake studies indicated that the new compounds are not substrates for the norA encoded quinolone efflux pump.
