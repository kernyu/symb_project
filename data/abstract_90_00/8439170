Production of propionicin PLG-1 by Propionibacterium thoenii P127 was pH dependent, with maximal activity detected in supernatants of cultures grown at pH 7.0 Propionicin PLG-1 was purified by ion-exchange chromatography and isoelectric focusing. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of propionicin PLG-1 purified through isoelectric focusing resolved a protein band with a molecular weight of 10,000. Propionicin PLG-1 was bactericidal to sensitive cells, demonstrating single-hit kinetics. The producing strain harbored a single plasmid (pLG1) with an approximate size of 250 kb. Preliminary data indicate that both propionicin PLG-1 and immunity to the bacteriocin are encoded on the chromosome. Exposure of strain P127 to acriflavine or to N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine yielded isolates that no longer produced bacteriocin activity and isolates that were cured of the plasmid. However, loss of bacteriocin production was not correlated with loss of the plasmid. Isolates cured of the plasmid were phenotypically identical to plasmid-bearing cells in fermentation patterns, pigment production, and growth characteristics.
