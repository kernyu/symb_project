The nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitors are structurally diverse compounds that are specific inhibitors of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 RT enzyme. The compounds are largely functionally identical and bind to a common site in the enzyme. HIV-1 variants that exhibit reduced susceptibility to these inhibitors have been derived in cell culture and, more recently, from HIV-1-infected patients undergoing experimental therapy. The variants express amino acid substitutions at RT positions that apparently interact directly with the inhibitors. Effects of specific substitutions at these positions vary among the compounds, suggesting subtle differences in how the compounds physically interact with the enzyme.
