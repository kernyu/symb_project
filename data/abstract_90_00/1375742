A murine monoclonal antibody (called H-11) that binds to the p 24 core protein of HIV-1 was characterized by radioimmuno-precipitation, immunofluorescence, western blot assays, immunocytochemistry and immunohistochemistry. This antibody was found to be especially suited for demonstrating the presence of HIV-1 in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues.
