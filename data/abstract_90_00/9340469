BACKGROUND: The resistance of enterococci against various antimicrobial substances including vancomycin has increased markedly. Since 1989 in the USA in particular high resistance rates against vancomycin have been observed but very few surveillance have been published in Europe. Therefore, we conducted a multicenter study in Germany to obtain information about the incidence and distribution of vancomycin and/or high-level aminoglycoside-resistant enterococci. METHODS: A total of 2046 enterococcal isolates were identified and susceptibility-testing was performed according to international guidelines. RESULTS: A total number of 90.5% of the enterococcal isolates were identified as Enterococcus faecalis and 7.8% was Enterococcus faecium. Resistance against ampicillin was detected in 56.6% of the Enterococcus faecium isolates, however, in only one Enterococcus faecalis isolate. High-level resistance against gentamycin or streptomycin was observed in 7.3% and 24.8% of the isolates, respectively. Twelve isolates showed resistance against vancomycin, however, cross resistance with teicoplanin was found in only two isolates. CONCLUSION: The rate of resistance of enterococci in Germany is still considerably lower than in the United States. Previous vancomycin therapy has been implemented as a risk factor for colonization or infection with vancomycin-resistant enterococci. Continued vigilance, decreased use of vancomycin and strict enforcement of infection control measures are appropriate measures to control the growing problem of resistant enterococci.
