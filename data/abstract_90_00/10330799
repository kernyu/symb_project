Within a 6-year period from January 1991 to December 1996, 19 patients with Salmonella choleraesuis bacteremia were enrolled for clinical and microbiological analysis. Young children, the elderly and patients with hematological malignancy (36.8%), liver cirrhosis (26.3%), systemic lupus erythematosus (10.5%), chronic renal impairment (10.5%), and peptic ulcer (10.5%) were at high risk of this infection. The ratio of male to female was 3:1. Three cases (15.8%) were nosocomially acquired. Fever (89.5%), chills (57.9%) and anorexia (52.6%) were the most common clinical manifestations. Seven patients (36.8%) presented no gastrointestinal manifestations. Normal white blood cell count was noted in seven patients (36.8%), and neutropenia caused by underlying diseases or severe infection was found in six cases (31.6%). Various types of metastatic focal infections were found, such as septic arthritis, cutaneous infection, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, and pneumonia. The severe immunocompromised status of patients and the high virulence of this pathogen may contribute to the high case fatality rate (21%). Higher resistance rate to commonly used antimicrobial agents was noted in ampicillin (94.7%), chloramphenicol (89.5%), and TMP/SMZ (63.8%). All strains of S. choleraesuis were susceptible to third-generation cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones. Generally, S. choleraesuis bacteremia should be taken into account in the differential diagnosis of sepsis in immunocompromised patients, even without gastrointestinal manifestations. The third-generation cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones may be the first choice for treatment of this invasive infections.
