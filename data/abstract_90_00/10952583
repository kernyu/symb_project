Klebsiella pneumoniae K6 (ATCC 700603), a clinical isolate, is resistant to ceftazidime and other oxyimino-beta-lactams. A consistent reduction in the MICs of oxyimino-beta-lactams by at least 3 twofold dilutions in the presence of clavulanic acid confirmed the utility of K. pneumoniae K6 as a quality control strain for extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) detection. Isoelectric-focusing analysis of crude lysates of K6 demonstrated a single beta-lactamase with a pI of 7.8 and a substrate profile showing preferential hydrolysis of cefotaxime compared to ceftazidime. PCR analysis of total bacterial DNA from K6 identified the presence of a bla(SHV) gene. K6 contained two large plasmids with molecular sizes of approximately 160 and 80 kb. Hybridization of plasmid DNA with a bla(SHV)-specific probe indicated that a bla(SHV) gene was encoded on the 80-kb plasmid, which was shown to transfer resistance to ceftazidime in conjugal mating experiments with Escherichia coli HB101. DNA sequencing of this bla(SHV)-related gene revealed that it differs from bla(SHV-1) at nine nucleotides, five of which resulted in amino acid substitutions: Ile to Phe at position 8, Arg to Ser at position 43, Gly to Ala at position 238, and Glu to Lys at position 240. In addition to the production of this novel ESBL, designated SHV-18, analysis of the outer membrane proteins of K6 revealed the loss of the OmpK35 and OmpK37 porins.
