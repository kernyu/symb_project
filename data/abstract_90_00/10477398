There are now several papers describing the development of antibodies to interferons (IFN) in patients undergoing IFN therapy. Moreover, there is increasing evidence to indicate that the development of antibodies to IFN may be associated with a failure of the beneficial effects of the therapy. This paper will review and discuss what is currently known about the technical, and biological aspects of antibodies to IFN, with particular reference to antibodies to IFN beta that develop during therapy. Three main considerations arise from the data. Firstly, a standardized quantitative assay to detect antibody to IFN must be agreed upon. Only when results can be compared, both qualitatively and quantitatively, will it be possible to monitor fully the ability of antibodies to cause a relapse during treatment. Secondly, sufficient data are now available to provide a rationale for monitoring the presence of anti-IFN antibodies in patients treated with IFN. This approach may allow a better understanding of the disease reactivation state observed in numerous patients treated with IFN. Finally, approaches aimed at limiting the immunogenicity of IFN preparations and/or strategies designed to circumvent antibody-mediated resistance to IFN treatment are required.
