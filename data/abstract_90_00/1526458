Clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus carry various antiseptic and disinfectant resistance determinants (qac genes) on a variety of plasmids. The biochemistry and specificity of these resistance genes in S. aureus is the subject of this report. The qac genes were separated into two families on the basis of resistance profiles and DNA homology. Isotopic and fluorimetric assays demonstrated that the qac genes encode efflux systems that rely on proton motive force.
