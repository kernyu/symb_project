An agar dilution method against trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole, sulfisoxazole, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was used to test clinical isolates of Mycobacterium intracellulare (MI) and M. avium (MA) from both HIV-infected and non-infected patients. MI and MA isolates demonstrated similar susceptibility data and were inhibited by concentrations of sulfamethoxazole achievable in serum.
