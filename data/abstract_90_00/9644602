Following its introduction into the market, PAPM/BP (panipenem/betamipron) was clinically studied in 188 evaluable cases out of 207 cases primarily of respiratory infectious diseases treated at the pediatric departments of 15 hospitals. In the clinical evaluation, the drug proved effective in three of three cases of sepsis; three of three cases of suppurative meningitis; nine of ten cases of laryngopharyngitis, six of seven cases of tonsillitis, 56 of 63 cases of acute bronchitis, 90 of 98 cases of pneumonia, and one of one case of phyothorax, all of which are respiratory infectious diseases; one of one case of secondary infection of a chronic respiratory disease; and two of two cases of lymphadenitis, which is a disease of the soft dermal structure. The overall efficacy rate was 91.0% (171/188 cases). In the bacteriological study, Gram-positive bacteria were eliminated in five of five strains of S. aureus, 30 of 31 strains of S. pneumoniae (96.8%), and three of three strains of S. pyogenes. Gramnegative bacteria were eliminated in 15 of 17 strains of H. influenzae (88.2%), three of four strains of M. catarrhalis, and two of two strains of K. pneumoniae. The overall elimination rate was 92.1% (70/76 strains). In the 23 strains of S. pneumoniae that were examined, penicillin-resistant strains accounted for 56.5%, showing an elimination rate of 100%. No serious adverse effects were observed, and the incidence of adverse effects was 1.45%. As for abnormalities in laboratory tests, levels of GOT and GPT increased in eight cases (3.88%), LDH increased in one case (0.48%), and neutropenia occurred in one case (0.51%). These results suggest that PAMP/BP could be considered the first choice in the treatment of infectious diseases in pediatrics, due to its effectiveness and high level of safety.
