Acinetobacter baumannii strains resistant to both imipenem (IPM) and ceftazidime (CAZ) were isolated from 1994 through 1996 at Gunma University Hospital. Nine isolates from different inpatients were examined for carbapenem-hydrolyzing activity and for the carbapemase gene bla(IMP) by the PCR method. All nine isolates were carbapenemase-producing strains that hydrolyzed IPM and that harbored bla(IMP). The bla(IMP) gene was transmissible by conjugation to an IPM-susceptible recipient strain of A. baumannii and conferred resistance to IPM, CAZ, cefotaxime (CTX), ampicillin (AMP), and piperacillin (PIP). Either intermediate or high-level resistance to amikacin (AMK) was transferred from two and five strains, respectively, concomitantly with bla(IMP), and gentamicin (GEN) resistance was also transferred in one instance of high-level AMK resistance. Comparative examination of clinical isolates for resistance patterns to nine drugs, IPM, CAZ, CTX, aztreonam, AMP, PIP, AMK, GEN, and norfloxacin, in addition to pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns with NotI-digested genomic DNA, confirmed nosocomial transmission of infections involving carbapenemase-producing A. baumannii strains.
