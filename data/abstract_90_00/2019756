Unidentified low-molecular-weight factor(s) in serum or nasopharyngeal secretions were known to phenotypically increase the resistance of Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) to bactericidal and opsonic antibodies, and resistance was attributed to two hypothetical mechanisms. Serum components generating resistance were studied. Mechanism 1, present in some Hib strains and their capsule-deficient mutants and accompanied by apparent increases in lipopolysaccharide content, was reproduced with a mixture of glucose, lactate, urea, and bicarbonate. Mechanism 2, present only in capsulated Hib and accompanied by increased capsulation, was reported with a mixture of Ca++ and lactate. Hib incubated with these compounds in buffer or grown in serum filtrate was resistant, but Hib grown in conventional media containing the metabolites in serum filtrate was resistant, but Hib grown in conventional media containing the metabolites was not. The resistant phenotype, which resembles Hib in vivo, may depend on nutrient balance as well as the specific factors. Lactate apparently is an important energy source for Hib.
