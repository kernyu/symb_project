The resurgence of tuberculosis has caused considerable effort to be focused on the development of rapid methods for determining the susceptibility of Mycobacterium tuberculosis to antimycobacterial agents. We demonstrated that susceptibility testing of M. tuberculosis can be accomplished rapidly by using flow cytometry. Results of tests were available within 24 h after M. tuberculosis organisms were incubated with ethambutol, isoniazid, rifampin, or streptomycin. The method was based on the ability of viable M. tuberculosis organisms to hydrolyze fluorescein diacetate (FDA) and the detection of fluorescent mycobacteria by flow cytometric analysis. The assay system also did not require multiplication of the mycobacteria. In contrast, M. tuberculosis organisms exposed to antimycobacterial agents hydrolyzed significantly less FDA. The use of flow cytometry and FDA staining shows considerable promise as a rapid method for obtaining susceptibility test results.
