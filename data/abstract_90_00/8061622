Three commonly used transfection techniques (electroporation, calcium phosphate precipitation and scrape loading) and a novel procedure combining the latter two methods were evaluated and conditions optimised for successful transfection of human HepG2 cells with plasmid DNA incorporating a mouse MHC Class I gene and a selectable marker (neomycin transferase gene) conferring resistance to G418. While transfection with linear DNA by scrape-loading gave satisfactory results, transfer of cloned circular DNA by electroporation, calcium phosphate precipitation or a combined use of scrape-loading and calcium phosphate gave best results for HepG2 cells.
