This study used a modified time-kill assay to compare the in-vitro activity of chloramphenicol and quinopristin/dalfopristin combined with vancomycin, ampicillin or gentamicin against multidrug-resistant Enterococcus faecium. The assay uses standardized time-kill methods with the following modifications: centrifugation of the test tubes at 1-2 h intervals, removal of supernatant and resuspension of bacteria in media containing antibiotic concentrations corresponding to simulated steady-state serum concentrations. None of the agents, alone or in combination, produced bactericidal or synergic activity. The modified time-kill assay more closely simulates in-vivo conditions and may provide a better qualitative assay to determine the interaction between antimicrobial agents and bacteria.
