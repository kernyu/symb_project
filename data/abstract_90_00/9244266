Microcin E492 is a polypeptide antibiotic that is produced and excreted by Klebsiella pneumoniae RYC492. The genetic determinants for microcin synthesis and immunity were cloned in Escherichia coli VCS257 into the cosmid vector pHC79, starting from total DNA of K. pneumoniae RYC492. The microcin E492 expressed in E. coli had the same properties as that of K. pneumoniae, i.e., the same molecular weight, the ability to form ionic channels in planar phospholipid bilayers, and essentially identical biological properties. Microcin E492 expression in E. coli, like that in K. pneumoniae, was mainly in the exponential phase of growth, declining in the stationary phase. The immunity determinant was subcloned into the same vector, and its expression was found to disappear in the stationary phase. This phenomenon is not dependent on rpoS, the stationary-phase sigma factor.
