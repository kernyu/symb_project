Chronic laryngitis in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome may be due to infections or tumors, such as Kaposi's sarcoma and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. We present what we believe to be the first proven case of herpes simplex virus chronic laryngitis in a man positive for human immunodeficiency virus. Direct laryngoscopy showed leukoplakic lesions on both vocal cords. Biopsy of the lesions showed squamous epithelial cells with the characteristic features of herpes simplex virus, which was confirmed by immunohistochemical stains. We discuss the differential diagnosis of chronic laryngitis in a human immunodeficiency virus infection. Herpes simplex viral infection of the vocal cords should be considered in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome presenting with chronic hoarseness and leukoplakic lesions on direct laryngoscopy, especially with no evidence of Kaposi's sarcoma, tumor, or cytomegaloviral or fungal infection elsewhere. Treatment should be acyclovir, except in the face of acyclovir resistance.
