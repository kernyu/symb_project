In vivo detection of free radicals on a quantitative basis is essential for an establishment of their role in membrane, protein, and cell and tissue damage. This article compares optical methods, including chemiluminescence, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and NMR methods for the study of free radicals and free radical damage, especially reperfusion injury neutrophil accumulation 6 hr after the ischemia/reperfusion insult. The chemiluminescence method is applied to an evaluation of the improved resistance to free radical stress due to transfection of creatine kinase in the mouse liver.
