The in vitro activity of BAY y 3118 against anaerobic cocci, Propionibacterium acnes, Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium difficile, Bacteroides fragilis, other Bacteroides spp. and fusobacteria was determined by an agar dilution method. This activity was compared with that of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, piperacillin, cefoxitin, imipenem, clindamycin and metronidazole. BAY y 3118, imipenem, clindamycin and metronidazole were the most active agents tested. The in vitro activity of BAY y 3118 against anaerobic bacteria was superior to that of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin.
