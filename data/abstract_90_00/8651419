Four hundred forty-four of S. aureus and 54 strains of E. coli were isolated from the neonates, born during the first six months of 1994 in the Maternity Hospital "Maichin dom". They were tested with the antibiotics--ampicilin, cephamandol and cefotaxime. Our results showed that 14.5% of the tested S. aureus were sensitive to ampicilin (e.g. broad-spectrum penicillins) and 85.5% resistant. Twenty percent of the strains E. coli were sensitive to ampicilin and 80% showed resistance. Fourty nine percent of the tested S. aureus were sensitive to cephamandol (a second generation cephalosporine) and 51% were resistant; 46.6% of the isolated strains E. coli were sensitive to cephamandol and 53.4% were resistant. Over 87% of the tested S. aureus were sensitive to cefotaxime, a third generation cephalosporine, and only 13% were resistant. From the tested strains E. coli 92.3% were sensitive to cefotaxime and 7.7% were resistant. The present study proved a high sensitivity of the isolated strains to cefotaxime. In addition this antibacterial drug showed good tolerance by the neonates when given in two doses per day and a lack of suppressive effect on the normal bacterial flora of the intestinal tract of the neonates.
