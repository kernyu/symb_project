In order to evaluate antimicrobial activity of ceftriaxone (CTRX), minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of CTRX and control drugs were determined against clinically isolated strains including those from purulent meningitis and liver and biliary tract infections in 1995. The results are summarized as follows; 1. MIC90 of CTRX was 0.05 micrograms/ml against benzylpenicillin (PCG)-insensitive Streptococcus pneumoniae or PCG-resistant S. pneumoniae and it was < or = 0.025 micrograms/ml against beta-lactamase producing strains of Haemophilus influenzae. Antimicrobial activities of CTRX against these strains were stronger than control drugs. 2. MIC distribution of CTRX was in a lower concentration range than those of ceftazidime and flomoxef against extend broad-spectrum beta-lactamase (EBLA)-producing Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae. 3. These results suggested that CTRX will be effective against community-acquired pneumonia, purulent meningitis and liver & biliary tract infections.
