Mycobacterium avium strains susceptible to clarithromycin and azithromycin contain mutants resistant to these macrolides with a frequency of 1.1 x 10(-10) to 1.2 x 10(-6). Cross-resistance between clarithromycin and azithromycin was demonstrated with mutants selected in the laboratory as well as with resistant strains isolated from patients. The susceptibility-resistance patterns of the macrolide-resistant strains with drugs other than macrolides were the same as those of the original susceptible strains. The emergence of clarithromycin resistance in patients was a result of multiplication of the preexisting resistant mutants that survived the elimination of bacteria during the initial period of treatment and was an exclusive cause of the relapse of bacteremia.
