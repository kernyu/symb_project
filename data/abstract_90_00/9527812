In vitro susceptibility testing for 50 clinical isolates of fluconazole-susceptible or -resistant Cryptococcus neoformans was performed with itraconazole and voriconazole. Voriconazole was more potent than itraconazole for fluconazole-susceptible isolates and as potent as itraconazole for fluconazole-susceptible dose-dependent isolates and for fluconazole-resistant isolates. For fluconazole-resistant isolates, the voriconazole and itraconazole MICs ranged from 1 to 2 microg/ml.
