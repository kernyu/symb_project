The often indiscriminate use of antimicrobial agents has led to increased bacterial resistance over the past years. This phenomenon is above all evident in nosocomial environments but also at a community level. It is therefore important that, in addition to the rational use of antibiotics, an accurate prophylaxis is performed which includes the correct use of disinfectants. This study examines the antimicrobial activity of various commercially available disinfectant solutions consisting of one or more active ingredients. An analysis of the results reveals that products consisting of an association of individual components (quaternary ammonium chloride with o-phenylphenol and/or isopropyl alcohol; chlorhexidine with benzalkonium chloride or with diazolidinylurea and isopropanol) demonstrate a greater efficacy in terms of microbicidal concentration and contact times.
