Multidrug resistance (MDR) in bacteria has been associated with efflux pumps that export structurally unrelated compounds and decrease cytoplasmic drug accumulation. To investigate MDR in mycobacteria, we studied the Mycobacterium smegmatis mutant mc(2)11, which is resistant to doxorubicin, tetracycline, rhodamine, ethidium bromide and the hydrophilic fluoroquinolones. A genomic library constructed from this mutant was used to select clones conferring resistance to doxorubicin. Surprisingly, the clone selected encodes the efflux pump LfrA, which has been reported to confer resistance to hydrophilic fluoroquinolones, ethidium bromide, rhodamine, and acriflavine. To define the contribution of LfrA to the innate mycobacterial drug resistance and to the MDR phenotype in mc(2)11, the lfrA gene was disrupted in both the mc(2)11 mutant and the mc(2)155 wild-type parent. LfrA disruption of the wild-type strain decreased resistance to ethidium bromide and acriflavine, and increased accumulation of ethidium bromide. However, disruption of lfrA gene results only in a 2-fold decrease in minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for ciprofloxacin, doxorubicin, rhodamine, and accumulation of [(14)C]ciprofloxacin was unchanged. LfrA disruption of the MDR strain mc(2)11 produced a similar phenotype. Thus, LfrA contributes significantly to the intrinsic MICs of M. smegmatis for ethidium bromide and acriflavine, but not for ciprofloxacin, doxorubicin or rhodamine.
