The pmd1+, a multidrug resistance gene of the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, encodes a protein similar to the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae STE6 gene product and mammalian P-glycoproteins. The STE6 protein is a membrane transporter of a-factor, a mating pheromone of a-type S. cerevisiae, which is structurally related to M-factor of the fission yeast. However, heterothallic or homothallic pmd1 null mutant cells of S. pombe, which were constructed by means of gene disruption, showed no significant decrease in the mating abilities. On the other hand, the multidrug resistance conferred by the pmd1+ was overcome by the treatment with verapamil, a typical inhibitor of mammalian P-glycoproteins. These results indicate that the pmd1+ gene product is functionally similar to mammalian P-glycoproteins, rather than to the budding yeast STE6.
