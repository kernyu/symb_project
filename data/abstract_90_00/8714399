Antibiotic properties of substances of a phytotoxic complex from Botrytis cinerea have been studied for a number of phytopathogenic bacteria, phytopathogenic and toxigenic fungi as well as saprophytic yeast strains. High fungistatic activity of preparations of phytotoxic metabolites (PTM) has been stated for Dendrodochium toxicum, Myrothecium verrucaria, M. roridum, Aspergillus fumigatus, Penicillium urticae, agents of heavy human and cattle mycotoxicoses. The studied representatives of phytopathogenic fusaria differed significantly in sensitivity to PTM: all the strains studied of the species from section Discolor (Fusarium gibbosum 54,624 and 51,463, F. graminearum 108,269, F. sambucinum 54,968, F. culmorum 54,951) were actively inhibited by the PTM concentrations studied; F. sporotrichiella 52,290 proved to be insensitive to them; the strains studied of the species from sections Elegans (F. oxysporum 55,715, F. moniliforme 54,262) and Martiella (F. javanicum 54,075, F. solani 54,719) possessed different sensitivity to PTM. The overwhelming majority of the yeast strains proved to be resistant to the PTM concentrations studied, except for the strains of Trichosporon cutaneum. In this connection the fact of high sensitivity of one of the strains of Kluyveromyces marxianus var. marxianus to B. cinerea metabolites arouses great interest. The strains of studied phytopathogenic bacteria (Erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora 8,982 and Clavibacter michiganense 13) were sensitive to higher concentrations of PTM.
