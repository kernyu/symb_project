Previously we demonstrated that IFN-alpha augments mda-6/WAF1 and inhibits cyclin-dependent kinases in a p53-independent fashion in B 16 murine melanoma cells. On the other hand, IFN-gamma activates p53 expression without affecting the mda-6/WAF1 system. Combination of the two IFNs is additive. B16 cells acquire IFN-alpha resistant but IFN-gamma sensitive phenotype after long term IFN-alpha treatment (B16alpha cells). Here we demonstrate the absence of mda-6/WAF1-associated repression of cyclin-dependent kinases, but the existence of p53-dependent c-myc inhibition in IFN-gamma-treated B16alpha cells. Clearly, selective desensitization of IFN-alpha related growth regulation does not influence the IFN-gamma associated pathway. Our results further support the coexistence of distinct growth regulatory mechanisms in B16 cells that can be activated by different IFN-types independently of each other.
