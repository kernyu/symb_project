The MICs of 17 antimicrobial agents for 181 Streptococcus pneumoniae strains were determined by the E-test. Overall, 69.1% were penicillin resistant (MIC > 0.06 microgram/ml). Resistance to ciprofloxacin (MIC > 2 microgram/ml), levofloxacin (MIC > 2 microgram/ml), or trovafloxacin (MIC > 1 microgram/ml) was found in 12.1, 5.5, or 2.2% of the strains, respectively. These high rates of resistance raise concerns for the future.
