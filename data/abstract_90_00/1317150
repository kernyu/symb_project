Seventeen oral streptococci and 18 enterococci were tested for the presence of DNA sequences homologous to the conjugative transposon Tn916 encoding tetracycline resistance. All the strains were resistant to tetracyclines, including minocycline, and most of them were resistant to other antibiotics. Tn916-like structures, identified by hybridization of HincII-digested DNA, were found on the chromosomes of 11 oral streptococci and four enterococci and on two plasmids, pIP1549 and pIP1440, one harbored by an Enterococcus hirae strain and the other harbored by an Enterococcus faecalis strain. Sequences homologous to Tn916, only some of which corresponded to its internal HincII structure (Tn916-modified elements), were chromosomally located in three oral streptococci and two enterococci and were plasmid borne in pIP614 harbored by an E. faecalis strain. Nine enterococci and three oral streptococci carried either the Tet M or the Tet O determinant chromosomally, but they carried no other sequences homologous to Tn916.
