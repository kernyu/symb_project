A case of recrudescent falciparum malaria after halofantrine treatment is described. The patient contracted Plasmodium falciparum in Ivory Coast and was treated with halofantrine. Plasma levels of halofantrine and its metabolite were adequate. Thirty-one days after treatment, the patient was rehospitalized with symptoms of malaria. Recrudescence was confirmed by microscopic examination, indicating a type RI resistance to halofantrine. Mefloquine was given to treat recrudescent malaria. The parasite was susceptible to chloroquine and quinine in vitro but displayed elevated values of 50% inhibitory concentration for mefloquine and halofantrine. The case reminds us that chloroquine still has an important therapeutic role against African strains of P. falciparum and that mefloquine and halofantrine should be reserved for multi drug-resistant P. falciparum.
