A genetic approach was used to study (dissimilatory) ferric iron (Fe3+) reduction in Shewanella putrefaciens 200. Chemical mutagenesis procedures and two rapid plate assays were developed to facilitate the screening of Fe3+ reduction-deficient mutants. Sixty-two putative Fe3+ reduction-deficient mutants were identified, and each was subsequently tested for its ability to grow anaerobically on various compounds as sole terminal electron acceptors, including Fe3+, nitrate (NO3-), nitrite (NO2-), manganese oxide (Mn4+), sulfite (SO3(2-)), thiosulfate (S2O3(2-)), trimethylamine N-oxide, and fumarate. A broad spectrum of mutants deficient in anaerobic growth on one or more electron acceptors was identified. Nine of the 62 mutants (designated Fer mutants) were deficient only in anaerobic growth on Fe3+ and retained the ability to grow on all other electron acceptors. These results suggest that S. putrefaciens expresses at least one terminal Fe3+ reductase that is distinct from other terminal reductases coupled to anaerobic growth. The nine Fer mutants were conjugally mated with an S. putrefaciens genomic library harbored in Escherichia coli S17-1. Complemented S. putrefaciens transconjugants were identified by the acquired ability to grow anaerobically on Fe3+ as the sole terminal electron acceptor. All recombinant cosmids that conferred the Fer+ phenotype appeared to carry a common internal region.
