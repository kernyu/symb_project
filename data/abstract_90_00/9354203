BACKGROUND: Quadruple therapy (bismuth, metronidazole and tetracycline (BMT) + proton pump inhibitor) is touted as being > 95% effective, regardless of metronidazole resistance. We tested a 10-day b.d. quadruple therapy for treatment of H. pylori infection. METHODS: Anti-H. pylori therapy consisted of lansoprazole 15 mg b.d. plus tetracycline 500 mg b.d., metronidazole 500 mg b.d., and swallowable Pepto-Bismol caplets (2 b.d.) for 10 days. H. pylori status was evaluated by culture and histology before and 4 or more weeks after therapy. RESULTS: The cure rate for intention-to-treat was 70%. Treatment success was calculated overall and separately in relation to antimicrobial resistance patterns. The cure rate among the metronidazole-sensitive isolates was 89.7% (26 of 29) vs. 41.2% (7 of 17) of the metronidazole-resistant isolates (P < 0.005). Moderate (n = 1) or severe (n = 3) side-effects were experienced in four patients with only one withdrawing because of side-effects. CONCLUSION: Twice a day quadruple therapy is effective for metronidazole-sensitive strains but its usefulness is markedly reduced by the presence of pre-treatment metronidazole resistance. Twice a day quadruple therapy can be recommended in locations where background metronidazole resistance is uncommon. Possibly, 14-day therapy or a higher dosage of metronidazole provide better results with metronidazole-resistant H. pylori.
