A prospective multicentre open study has been conducted in France in order to assess the efficacy and tolerability of an antimycobacterial regimen including rifabutin in the treatment of patients with pulmonary tuberculosis due to rifampicin and isoniazid resistant bacilli. Patients were treated with daily rifabutin (450-600 mg), associated with companion drugs to which the organisms remained susceptible; in most cases the regimen included a fluoroquinolone. The duration of treatment was initially scheduled for a minimum period of 12 months after sputum culture conversion. Thirty nine patients were enrolled, 23 of whom were treated for at least 12 months. Culture conversion was obtained at the end of the twelfth month in 14 out of 23 patients. Twenty one out of 39 patients experienced adverse events. These were, however, serious enough to discontinue treatment in only four patients. These results suggest that an antimycobacterial combination including rifabutin might contribute to the treatment of multi-resistant pulmonary tuberculosis.
