Saccharomyces cerevisiae contains two genes (DOGR1 and DOGR2) that are able to confer 2-deoxyglucose resistance when they are overexpressed. These genes are very similar, sharing 92% identity at the protein level. They code for two isoenzymes with 2-deoxyglucose-6 phosphate (2-DOG-6P) phosphatase activity. These enzymes have been purified and characterized. DogR1p shows an optimum pH of 6, an optimum temperature of 30 degrees C and a KM on 2-DOG-6P of 17 mM. DogR2p shows a similar optimum pH, but the optimum temperature is 40 degrees C and it exhibits a KM on 2-DOG-6P of 41 mM. Both enzymes require 10 mM-MgCl2 for maximal activity and they are inhibited by inorganic phosphate.
