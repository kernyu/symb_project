The emergence of MRSA in the 1960s coincided with the introduction of fusidic acid. Since that time, the antibiotic has been widely used against this organism, both in the 1960s and 1970s and against the more modern multi-resistant version of the 1980s and 1990s. Although showing potent in vitro activity, experimental in vivo and in vitro investigations have demonstrated disappointing results. Clinical efficacy has been demonstrated in a series of small studies and case reports, particularly when fusidic acid is used in combination for the treatment of MRSA carriage. Given the widespread use of fusidic acid against MRSA, published evidence supporting its efficacy is limited and does not support the use of the agent as monotherapy.
