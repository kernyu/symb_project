Resistance to the aminoglycoside gentamicin in the nebramycin producer, Streptomyces tenebrarius, occurs at the level of the ribosome. A resistance determinant isolated from this actinomycete was previously shown to encode a methylase enzyme which modifies residue G-1405 of 16S ribosomal RNA. This gene (kgmB) has been sequenced and expressed in Escherichia coli using lacZ transcriptional signals since, like many other actinomycete genes, kgmB is not expressed in E. coli from its own promoter. The 5' end of the kgmB transcript has been mapped revealing a single promoter which does not obviously conform to the prokaryotic consensus.
