Carbapenems L-749,345 and imipenem had the lowest MICs at which 90% of isolates were inhibited (0.5 microg/ml) of 14 antimicrobial agents tested against 76 multiresistant gram-negative clinical isolates with TEM- or SHV-type extended-spectrum beta-lactamases and chromosomal or plasmid-determined AmpC beta-lactamases, but the MIC of L-749,345 for one isolate of Klebsiella pneumoniae was 16 microg/ml.
