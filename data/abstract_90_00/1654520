The DNA nucleotide sequence from the central region of the composite transposons Tn9* and Tn9' at the junction with the right copy of IS1 was determined. From the data obtained it follows that both transposons are members of the Tn9 family, although they contain additional DNA segments with regard to Tn9 of the length about 320 and 290 b.p. respectively lying distal to the cat gene. It was proposed that all the transposons of the Tn9 family have been formed as a result of IS1-mediated deletions of the plasmid R100 r-determinant. It was revealed from the data of computer analysis that in the sequenced DNA there are two potential promotors with transcription directed opposite in relation to the transcription of the cat gene.
