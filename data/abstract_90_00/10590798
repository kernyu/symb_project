OBJECTIVE: To compare the profitability of three anthelmintic strategies in growing lambs in flocks with nematodes resistant to benzimidazole anthelmintics. METHOD: A partial-budgeting analysis was carried out by means of a stochastic simulation model, which allows inputs to be described as distributions rather than as fixed values, and hence permits variation between farms to be considered in the analysis. RESULTS: The results show that control of nematode parasites by use of an effective anthelmintic provides the highest net returns, yielding a margin over ineffectively treated lambs of A$114 per 100 lambs on average. Suppressive treatment based on the administration of two controlled-release capsules and monthly with moxidectin resulted in an average loss of A$131 per 100 lambs in comparison with animals treated with an ineffective anthelmintic. Analysis of the results from capsule-treated lambs did not take into account the unmeasured benefits associated with less contamination of pastures. Sensitivity analysis using a stochastic model indicates that apart from the effect of treatment on weight gain variation in carcase price greatly influences the profitability of all the parasite control programs examined. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that it is economically important for farmers to adjust their strategy in the presence of anthelmintic resistance. But as a result of uncertainty in the factors influencing economic return, the expected economic benefit is likely to vary substantially.
