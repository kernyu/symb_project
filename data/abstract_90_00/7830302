Multi-drug resistant strains of Salmonella isolated from blood and bone marrow cultures of pyrexial patients received from physicians, hospitals and different clinics were studied from May to November, 1993. Of 2143 samples collected, 424(20%) cases yielded the growth of different organisms. Out of these 266(63%) were positive for Salmonella strains. The strains isolated were Salmonella typhi 239(90%) and Salmonella paratyphi A 27(10%). Two hundred twenty (82%) strains of Salmonella showed increased beta-lactamase activity and an alarming increase in resistance against commonly used antibiotics for enteric fever.
