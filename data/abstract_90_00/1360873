Analysis of a panel of endothelial cells passaged between 5 and 25 times and derived from various organs and species demonstrated that murine and porcine cerebral capillary endothelial cells actively excluded the fluorescent dye rhodamine 123, a substrate of P-glycoprotein. In addition, rhodamine 123 accumulation could be enhanced by the multidrug resistance chemosensitizer verapamil, known to reduce P-glycoprotein-mediated drug efflux. Cloned murine and porcine cerebral capillary endothelial cells were immunoreactive with the C219 monoclonal antibody to P-glycoprotein, and a C219 epitope-specific blocking peptide could abolish staining. The antiproliferative and cytotoxic effects of vincristine, but not cis-platinum(II) diamminedichloride, were increased by the addition of either verapamil or cyclosporin A to brain endothelial cell cultures in a 72-h assay, as determined by [3H]thymidine incorporation and total protein measurement. Cyclosporin A was a more effective reversal agent than verapamil. Thus, a P-glycoprotein isoform may be constitutively expressed in brain endothelial cells in vitro and supports the available data on in situ immunohistochemical staining of P-glycoprotein at the blood-brain barrier. In addition, these findings may indicate that one function of P-glycoprotein in vivo at the blood-brain barrier is the exclusion of xenobiotics from central nervous system tissues.
