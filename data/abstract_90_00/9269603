Mycobacteria Growth Indicator Tube (MGIT) is a recently introduced rapid growth detection method which uses an oxygen quenched fluorescent indicator. The present study evaluated the ability of this new method to determine the drug susceptibility of Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC). Thirty strains recovered from patients with AIDS were tested for susceptibility to clarithromycin, rifabutin, ciprofloxacin, azithromycin and amikacin using MGIT. Results were compared to susceptibilities determined by the agar dilution method. The results obtained showed a 100% correlation between MGIT and the agar dilution method for rifabutin and clarithromycin. There was a 100% correlation between the two methods for azithromycin against 27 strains. MGIT was well correlated with the agar dilution method for detecting resistance to clarithromycin, rifabutin and azithromycin in 4 days, but the correlation was poor when susceptibilities to ciprofloxacin and amikacin were determined. This rapid method is non-radiometric, noninvasive and does not require any special instruments.
