Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is frequently isolated from skin lesions, such as in the decubitus region. There is a possibility that MRSA through these lesions can spread widely in a hospital. However, local treatment with most antibiotics and antiseptics (povidone-iodine) is not effective to eradicate MRSA from the infected decubitus. We have recently demonstrated that gentian violet (Gv) possessed a bactericidal effect against MRSA isolated from clinical specimens in vitro. This examination evaluated whether or not a topical ointment containing 0.1% Gv is effective to eradicate MRSA which existed in decubitus regions. Decubitus (14 clinical cases, ages 59-87 years) infected with MRSA were treated with 0.1% Gv-ointment once or twice daily after bathing in 0.1% Gv aqueous solution. Although all patients were treated with povidone-iodine and 9 out of 14 patients were given either local or systemic administration of antibiotics, those treatments were not effective to eradicate MRSA from decubituses. However, MRSA was not detectable in all cases within 34 days (average: 10.8 days +/- 2.7) after treatment with 0.1% Gv-ointment. The eradication of MRSA from decubitus areas tended to be delayed, depending upon the size and depth of decubituses (Grade III and IV) and complications such as diabetes mellitus. Skin irritability was not observed in any patients. These results suggest that 0.1% Gv-ointment is a useful material for the treatment of the MRSA-local wound infection. Treatment with Gv-ointment to MRSA-infected decubitus may exhibit a protective effect with regard to infection with MRSA in hospital.
