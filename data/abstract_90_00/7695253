(2'R,5'S-)-cis-5-Fluoro-1-[2-(hydroxymethyl)-1,3-oxathiolan-5-yl] cytosine (524W91) is a nucleoside analog with potent anti-human immunodeficiency virus and anti-human hepatitis B virus activities in vitro. The pharmacokinetics and bioavailability of 524W91 after oral dosing were studied in mice dosed with 10, 100, and 600 mg of 524W91 per kg of body weight by the oral and intravenous routes. Cynomolgus monkeys were dosed with 10 and 80 mg of 524W91 per kg. In both species, the clearance of 524W91 was rapid, via the kidney, and was independent of dose. In monkeys, the total body clearance of 10 mg of 524W91 per kg was 0.7 +/- 0.1 liter/h/kg, and the volume of distribution at steady state was 0.8 +/- 0.02 liter/kg. The terminal elimination half-life was 1.0 +/- 0.2 h. The absolute bioavailability after oral dosing was 63% +/- 4% at 10 mg/kg. Concentrations of 524W91 in the cerebrospinal fluid were 4% +/- 0.7% of the corresponding levels in plasma. In mice, the total clearance of 10 mg of 524W91 per kg was 2.3 liters/kg/h, and the volume of distribution at steady state was 0.9 liter/kg. Absolute bioavailability in mice after oral dosing was 96% at a dose of 10 mg/kg. The metabolism of orally administered [6-3H]524W91 was studied in cynomolgus monkeys at a dose of 80 mg/kg and in mice at a dose of 120 mg/kg. Monkeys excreted 41% +/- 6% of the radioactive dose in the 0- to 72-h urine, 33% +/- 10% in the feces, and 10% +/- 7% in the cage wash. Unchanged 524W91 was 64% of the total radiolabeled drug recovered in the urine. The glucuronide was a minor urinary metabolite. 5-Fluorouracil was not detected (less than 0.02% of the dose). Mice dosed orally with 120 mg of [6-3H]524W91 per kg excreted 67% +/- 7% of the radiolable in the )- to 48-h urine. Small amounts of the 3' -sulfoxide and glucuronide metabolites were observed in the urine, but 5-fluorouracil was not detected. Good bioavailability after oral dosing and resistance to metabolism recommend 524W91 for further preclinical evaluation.
