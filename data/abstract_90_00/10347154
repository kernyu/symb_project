Yap1 and Skn7 are two yeast transcriptional regulators that co-operate to activate thioredoxin (TRX2) and thioredoxin reductase (TRR1) in response to redox stress signals. Although they are both important for resistance to H2O2, only Yap1 is important for cadmium resistance, whereas Skn7 has a negative effect upon this response. The respective roles of Yap1 and Skn7 in the induction of defense genes by H2O2 were analyzed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Yap1 controls a large oxidative stress response regulon of at least 32 proteins. Fifteen of these proteins also require the presence of Skn7 for their induction by H2O2. Although about half of the Yap1 target genes do not contain a consensus Yap1 recognition motif, the control of one such gene, TSA1, involves the binding of Yap1 and Skn7 to its promoter in vitro. The co-operative control of the oxidative stress response by Yap1 and Skn7 delineates two gene subsets. Remarkably, these two gene subsets separate antioxidant scavenging enzymes from the metabolic pathways regenerating the main cellular reducing power, glutathione and NADPH. Such a specialization may explain, at least in part, the dissociated function of Yap1 and Skn7 in H2O2 and cadmium resistance.
