The rabbits were infected intradermally with a strain of S. aureus resistant to neomycin. They were treated with neomycin, Na2EDTA and by combination of these substances, which were applied as a cream with differing concentrations of these factors. Simultaneous application of neomycin and Na2EDTA for treatment of experimental staphylococcal infections caused in rabbits with a strain resistant to neomycin, resulted in acceleration of healing of pustular changes, when compared with results obtained in animals treated with these substances alone.
