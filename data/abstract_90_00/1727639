An H2O2-resistant variant (OC14) of the HA1 Chinese hamster fibroblast cell line which demonstrates a 20-fold increase in catalase activity was utilized in the study of mechanisms responsible for cellular resistance to hydrogen peroxide, oxygen, and 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal toxicity. HA1 and OC14 cells were treated with 9 mM aminotriazole which resulted in a 60 to 80% reduction in catalase activity. Pretreatment with aminotriazole resulted in significant sensitization to the toxicity of 1-h exposures to exogenously applied H2O2, which was proportional to the reduction in catalase activity. Treatment with aminotriazole produced significant sensitization to the toxicity of 95% O2 after 45 h of O2 exposure but no sensitization to the toxicity of a 1-h exposure to 50 microM 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal. Inhibition of catalase activity by aminotriazole had no effect on the metabolism of 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal by either cell line tested. These results support the conclusion that in H2O2-resistant cells, catalase activity is a major determinant of cellular resistance to H2O2 toxicity, whereas catalase activity has a limited role in cellular resistance to an acute exposure to 95% O2 and is unrelated to cellular resistance to 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal.
