NEW IN VITRO MODELS: Numerous posters at the ICAAC were devoted to in vitro models simulating plasma kinetics, including many concerning new molecules, especially fluoroquinolones. Gatifloxacine, for example, has been found to be very active against Gram positive and intracellular germs. The performance of clinafloxacine against Gram negatives was also announced. Moxifloxacine was studied with a novel dynamic in vitro model against penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. In this model, the bactericidal effect was very rapid and complete, with no regrowth. ADVANCES IN THE PRECLINICAL PHASE: There was much discussion concerning in vitro models and experimental infections which are being used to further accelerate preclinical investigations of new compounds.
