Out of 110 strains of Staphylococcus aureus isolated from 1985 to 1990, isolation rate of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) was investigated. Nineteen strains of 59 S. aureus from outpatients and 20 strains of 51 S. aureus from inpatients were determined as MRSA. Isolation frequency of MRSA from inpatients was increasing in the recent two years. Coagulase type, enterotoxin type and production of toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 (TSST-1) were examined in 22 strains of MRSA. Coagulase type II (86%), enterotoxin type C (68%) and TSST-1 positive strain was most dominant. Susceptibility of MRSA to 4 antimicrobial agents were measured, MRSA were sensitive to vancomycin (VCM), arbekacin (ABK) and minocycline, but resistant to flomoxef. Thirty-four patients from whom MRSA was isolated including 20 patients from urine, 13 from pus and 1 from blood, were analyzed clinically. Pyuria was not recognized in some cases in whom MRSA was isolated from their urine. Concomitant polymicrobial infection was frequently noted in those patients with MRSA in their urinary tract. These facts show that the pathogenic role of MRSA in the urinary tract infection was not significant. On the other hand, when MRSA was isolated from pus or blood, serious infections could be caused by MRSA, especially in compromised host. Regarding the treatment in these cases, administration of VCM or ABK was though to be necessary.
