Cycloheximide sensitivity or resistance in yeast is under the control of genes encoding different forms of ribosomal protein L41. In our previous studies, we have shown by isolating L41-Q1a, L41-P1a and their respective allelic genes, L41-Q1b and L41-P1b, from the partial diploid genome of C. maltosa, that this species, which is inducibly resistant to CYH, has both types of the L41 genes and that the expression of at least one of the L41-Q genes is induced by CYH, whereas L41-P genes are constitutively expressed. Here, we have identified another L41 (L41-Q2a), its allelic gene (L41-Q2b) and a third gene (L41-Q3) from the genome of C. maltosa. By gene disruption experiments, we now show that L41-Q1a and L41-Q1b are not responsible for the resistance to CYH and that the DeltaL41-Ps strain, which has only functional L41-Q genes, shows constitutive resistance to CYH, but grows more slowly than the DeltaL41-Qs strain, which has only functional L41-P genes, in the absence of CYH. Our results also show that in vitro, ribosomes containing L41-Q-type are less active in translation than those containing L41-P-type, although only the former ribosomes are active in the presence of CYH. These data suggest that ribosomes containing L41-Q-type are less active under normal growth conditions, but that this activity is not affected in the presence of CYH. We discuss the possible multi-step evolutionary event(s) by which C. maltosa has acquired the property of inducible resistance to CYH.
