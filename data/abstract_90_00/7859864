We have studied the prevalence of anti-microbial resistance of Streptococcus pneumoniae in Southwest Germany. One hundred seventy-four clinical isolates of pneumococci collected from hospitalized patients between October 1992 and April 1994 were used for MIC determinations. MICs for penicillin, ceftriaxone, erythromycin, and rifampicin were assessed by the E test. Eleven of the 174 strains (6.3%) were intermediately resistant to penicillin (MIC between 0.1 and 1.0 microgram/ml) and four of the 174 strains (2.3%) were intermediately resistant to ceftriaxone (MIC between 0.1 and 1.0 microgram/ml). All four isolates with a reduced susceptibility to ceftriaxone also demonstrated intermediate resistance to penicillin. Six of the 174 strains (3.5%) were highly resistant (MIC > or = 8 micrograms/ml) to erythromycin. Resistance to rifampicin was not observed. Our results demonstrate that pneumococcal resistance to penicillin and erythromycin has increased markedly in Germany over the last decade. Our findings underline the need for continuous surveillance of antimicrobial resistance of Streptococcus pneumoniae.
