Optimal use of antibiotics in hospitalized patients raises several problems. i) Does the patient really have an infection treatable with antibiotics? Currently, there are no clinical or biological data which can resolve this question with sufficient sensitivity and specificity. ii) Are microbial samples warranted before starting treatment? All bacteria isolated from cerebrospinal, ascitis, pleural or articular fluids are pathogens whereas a quantitative assessment is required for bacteria isolated from the upper or lower respiratory tract. iii) If an antibiotic is needed should a single drug or a multiple drug regimen be prescribed? Twenty years ago two-drug regimens were necessary. Synergism and better spectrum were the keystones of two-drug therapy. Today, single-drug regimens are sufficient except in case of Staphylococcus, Pseudomonas or some Enterobacteriacae infections. iv) Which administration route is best? In hospitalized patients, the parenteral route is generally used with a rapid switch to oral administration, usually within 48 hours. v) How long should the antibiotics be given? Treatment duration depends on the bacteria, the patient and the organ involved. vi) How can resistance be avoided? Rotating between antibiotics has been proposed to reduce the emergence of multidrug resistant bacteria, although this concept remains to be validated by controlled studies.
