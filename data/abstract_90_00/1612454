The three macrolide-resistance-encoding genes, tlrC from Streptomyces fradiae, srmB from Streptomyces ambofaciens, and carA from Streptomyces thermotolerans, encode proteins that possess significant sequence similarity to ATP-dependent transport proteins. The N-terminal and C-terminal halves of these proteins are very similar to each other and contain highly conserved regions that resemble ATP-binding domains typically present within the superfamily of ATP-dependent transport proteins. These observations suggest that the mechanism by which these genes confer resistance to macrolides is due to export of the antibiotics, a process that is driven by energy derived from ATP hydrolysis.
