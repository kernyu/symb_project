Two clones of Leishmania mexicana resistant to 5 microM (LmR5CL2) and 20 microM (LmR20CL1) pentamidine, derived from a parental wild-type clone (LmWTCL3) were selected in vitro using a continuous drug pressure protocol. Both resistant clones expressed a cross-resistance to diminazene aceturate. No differences in their in-vitro infectivity for mouse peritoneal macrophages between wild-type and pentamidine-resistant promastigotes were observed. During these experiments, promastigotes of LmR20CL1 derived from intramacrophagic amastigote forms reverted to the pentamidine-sensitive phenotype, unlike the lower resistant ones. In the same way, when a complete developmental sequence of L. mexicana was achieved in axenic cultures, LmR20CL1 promastigotes derived from axenically growing amastigotes expressed an IC50 value close to the wild-type one, whereas resulting LmR5CL2 promastigotes remained pentamidine resistant. This modulation of the chemoresistance during the developmental life cycle could be significant in the transmission of drug-resistant strains by Phlebotominae as well as in basic research to follow drug resistance during the in-vitro and in-vivo life cycle of Leishmania.
