Eighty-nine Staphylococcus aureus strains were grouped according to their susceptibility or resistance to methicillin and oxacillin. The role of beta-lactamase in borderline methicillin resistance was confirmed by tests with beta-lactamase inhibitors, particularly when salt-supplemented medium was used. A penicillin-binding protein assay indicated that borderline methicillin-resistant S. aureus strains do not produce PBP 2a.
