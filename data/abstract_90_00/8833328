The tetracycline-controlled gene expression system utilizes the control elements of the tetracycline resistance operon encoded in TnlO of Escherichia coli to control gene expression in eukaryotic cells. Here we demonstrate the quantitative control of the expression of the luciferase gene, dihydrofolate reductase gene, and bcl-2 gene in HeLa S3 or Chinese hamster ovary AA8 cells using the tetracycline-controlled gene expression system. Regardless of the host cell lines or the genes being expressed, there is a common range of tetracycline concentration within which the expression of genes is most sensitively regulated. In addition, the maximal gene expression level of the tetracycline-controlled gene expression system is higher than that of the wild-type CMV promoter/enhancer-driven system. Nonetheless, careful selection of stably transfected clones is necessary to achieve the optimally regulated gene expression using this system.
