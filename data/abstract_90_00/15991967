Fluoroquinolone antimicrobials have been available for over 10 years. Recent modifications to nuclear side-chains have enhanced both the antimicrobial and pharmacokinetic profiles of this class. Rapidly increasing antimicrobial resistance among community and hospital bacterial pathogens has diminished therapeutic options. Infections caused by such pathogens, including drug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae and multi-resistant Enterobacteriaceae are now treatable by few classes of antibacterials, one of these being the fluoroquinolones. Ciprofloxacin was one of the first effective agents available in both iv. and oral formulations for the treatment of Gram-negative infection, resistant to other antibiotics. More recent developments, such as sparfloxacin and grepafloxacin, are more effective in vitro against Gram-positive pathogens, although their safety profile may be less promising. Fluoroquinolones not yet in widespread clinical use, including trovafloxacin, clinafloxacin and moxifloxacin, hold considerable promise as community 'respiratory antimicrobials' and the results of clinical trials are awaited with anticipation. In this review, the three generations of fluoroquinolone development are examined and the relative antimicrobial, pharmacokinetic, clinical and safety profiles of available and developmental quinolones are compared.
