We analyzed DNA lesions produced by H2O2 under low iron conditions, the cross adaptive response and the synergistic lethal effect produced by iron chelator-o-phenanthroline, using different Escherichia coli mutants deficient in DNA repair mechanisms. At normal iron levels the lesions produced by H2O2 are repaired mainly by the exonuclease III protein. Under low iron conditions we observed that the Fpg and UvrA proteins as well as SOS and OxyR systems participate in the repair of these lesions. The lethal effect of H2O2 is strengthened by o-phenanthroline if both compounds are added simultaneously to the culture medium. This phenomenon was observed in the wild type cells and in the xthA mutant (hypersensitive to H2O2). E. coli cells treated with low concentrations of H2O2 (micromolar) acquire resistance to different DNA damaging agents. Our results indicate also that pretreatment with high (millimolar) H2O2 concentrations protects cells against killing, by UV and this phenomenon is independent of the SOS system, but dependent on RecA and UvrA proteins. H2O2 induces protection against lethal and mutagenic effects of N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG). H2O2 also protects the cells against killing by cumene hydroperoxide, possibly with the participation of Ahp protein.
