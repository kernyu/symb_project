We examined the in vitro phenotypic and genotypic profiles of an extensively passaged human immunodeficiency virus type 1 clinical isolate which has been selected for lamivudine resistance, with an M184V mutation in a zidovudine-resistant genetic background, and then cultured with zidovudine alone. Our passaging strategy led to a decrease in lamivudine IC50 values, which were comparable to those prior to lamivudine exposure, and the genotypic restoration of the wild-type sequence at codon 184 of reverse transcriptase.
