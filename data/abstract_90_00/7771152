A high degree of resistance to cholera diagnostic phages and carriership of prophages characteristic of V. cholerae eltor strains vct+ were shown to be the specific features V. cholerae isolated in Daghestan during the period of June-October 1994. Among the strains under study, isolated respectively in 12 and 18 out of 19 regions of Daghestan, a high proportion was found to have resistance to tetracycline (65%) and chloramphenicol (28.6%). Moreover, some strains were found to be resistant to furagin and erythromycin. Out of 242 strains resistant to antibacterial preparations, 163 strains were found to have multiple resistance. Gentamicin, cipropfloxacin and doxicycline were shown to have high in vitro activity with respect to the strains under study.
