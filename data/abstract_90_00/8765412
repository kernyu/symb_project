In vivo administration of interleukin 12 (IL-12) at 2000 U/mouse induced IL-12-activated killer (IL-12AK) cells in parallel with an elevation in serum interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) activity. Although NK1.1+CD3- natural killer cells are the major precursor of IL-12AK cells, asialoGM1+CD8+ T-cells were also demonstrated to be novel precursors. Such anomalous killer cells may play an important role in the early stages of the host defense mechanisms against tumors. It was also shown that IL-12 is effective in inducing tumor-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocytes. Consistent with these data, IL-12 had marked activity against various kinds of established tumors when given systemically. Mice cured of tumors by IL-12 treatment acquired tumor-specific T-cell immunity. Moreover, we initially demonstrated that IL-12 was effective in preventing and inhibiting the growth of primary tumors induced by the chemical carcinogen methylnitrosourea using c-Ha-ras transgeneic mice. Finally, we investigated the application of IL-12 to antitumor gene therapy. Transfer of the IL-12 gene into A20 B-lymphoma cells resulted in the continuous production of IL-12 and caused abrogation of in vivo tumorigenicity. Tumor cells transfected with the IL-12 gene are potentially a good tool as a tumor vaccine, as they effectively induced IL-12AK cells, IFN-gamma production, and tumor-specific protective immunity. Although B16-BL-6 melanoma cells, which are a highly metastatic subclone of B16 melanoma cells, showed resistance to IL-12 gene therapy, combination therapy with the B7-1 gene and systemic IL-12 administration almost completely inhibited tumor metastasis. Similar results were obtained using B16-BL-6 melanoma cells transfected with both B7-1 and IL-12 genes. These results suggest that IL-12 is a promising cytokine for antitumor cytokine and gene therapy.
