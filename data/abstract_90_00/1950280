The medicinal resistance of salmonellae isolated in the USSR and the Slovak Republic in 1987-1988 was studied. The resistance of salmonellae at this period was shown to decrease in comparison with the period of 1985-1986. The study revealed the presence of multiresistant strains capable of the conjugative transmission of some resistance markers. The minimal inhibiting concentrations of antibiotics to which salmonellae proved to be resistant were determined.
