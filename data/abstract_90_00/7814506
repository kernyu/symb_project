The BBL Crystal system (Becton Dickinson Microbiology Systems, Cockeysville, Md.) was evaluated for its accuracy in identifying oxacillin resistance in Staphylococcus aureus by testing of mec-specific-gene-positive and -negative isolates. Although the manufacturer makes no claim for use of the product for testing of staphylococci other than S. aureus, the product's potential utility in detecting oxacillin resistance in isolates of mec gene-positive and -negative Staphylococcus epidermidis was also explored. All mec gene-negative staphylococci yielded a negative MRSA ID test reaction. There was a close correlation between mec gene positivity and a positive reaction in the methicillin-resistant S. aureus identification system with 63 of 69 (91%) stock isolates of S. aureus yielding a positive result in 4 h, 66 of 69 (95%) yielding a positive result in 5 h, and 68 of 69 (99%) yielding a positive result in 6 h. The corresponding percentage agreements at 4, 5, and 6 h for mec gene-positive stock isolates of S. epidermidis were 87, 91, and 96%, respectively.
