Alpha- and gamma-interferons have been shown to actively suppress hematopoiesis in patients in the chronic phase of chronic myelogenous leukemia in vitro and in vivo. Since both interferons act through different receptors on their hematopoietic target cells, they are expected to be capable of independently inhibiting abnormal blood cell development in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia. We have utilized recombinant human interferon alfa-2c to treat 11 patients with Philadelphia chromosome positive chronic myelogenous leukemia in chronic phase, who were resistant to previous interferon gamma therapy. Ten of the patients were evaluable for hematologic, cytogenetic and molecular-genetic response following interferon alfa-2c therapy for 6 to 30 months. In 5 patients, IFN alfa-2c treatment failed due to lack of hematologic response. A complete hematologic or partial hematologic response was achieved in the remaining 5 patients. Three of these experienced cytogenetic improvement with reappearence of 100% diploid hematopoietic cells and disappearence of c-abl/bcr rearrangement in one patient. In two patients interferon alfa-2c did not prevent transformation of the disease into an accelerated state or blast crisis, respectively. We conclude that recombinant human interferon alfa-2c may also control hematopoiesis in interferon-gamma resistant chronic myelogenous leukemia patients, although the long-term response will need to be elucidated in further studies.
