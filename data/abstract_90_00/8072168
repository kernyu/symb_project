UNLABELLED: Changes in properties of MRSA and the status of MRSA infections in the last two years were investigated by an MRSA Forum composed of 18 groups including 115 medical institutions in Japan. And an opinion poll regarding MRSA was taken by professional doctors (41) and general clinical doctors (323). Points of discussion: 1. Did properties of MRSA change? 2. Did the pattern of MRSA infections change? 3. Did the understanding of MRSA change? 4. What is the relationship between MRSA and the 3rd cephems? 5. How is MRSA related to polymicrobial infections? 6. Is ABK useful against MRSA infections? 7. What will be future trend in characteristics of MRSA and MRSA infections? CONCLUSIONS: 1. MRSA has become more resistant to methicillin however it seemed to have become less toxic. 2. Severe MRSA infections are decreasing and colonizations are increasing. 3. There were some differences in attitude against MRSA between professional doctors and general clinical doctors. 4. The 3rd cephem should be used reasonably. 5. MRSA infections should be treated with polymicrobial infections in consideration. 6. MRSA did not gain resistance against ABK and ABK is useful against MRSA infections. 7. Problems of MRSA will cool down but they should always be kept in our mind.
