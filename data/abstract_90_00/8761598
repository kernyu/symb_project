The susceptibility to cefepime and to other beta-lactams of 1017 inducible cephalosporinase-producing enterobacteria, 897 Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains, and 295 Acinetobacter baumanii strains was studied over a two-year period (July 1, 1993 to June 30, 1995). The isolates were from patients in visceral surgery, intensive care, and clinical hematology wards. Cefepime was compared to other third-generation cephalosporins and to imipenem, aztreonam, and the piperacillin-tazobactam combination. Cefepime was more active than the other cephalosporins against Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens and Citrobacter freundii. Activity of cefepime on the study isolates was also greater than that of aztreonam and of the piperacillin-tazobactam combination. Cefepime exhibited outstanding activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains except those with the O12 serotype.
