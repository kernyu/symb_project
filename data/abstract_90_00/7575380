On the basis of results of sensitivity tests carried out in 1992 by means of a standardized agar diffusion test according to DIN 58,940 by 28 laboratories performing routine diagnosis, frequency of resistance was evaluated in the form of rank orders. For "calculated" chemotherapy, the choice of the substance to be applied is determined by the sensitivity of the presumptive pathogen, if laboratory results relating to the agent are (still) lacking. Evaluation of the pathogens tested (clostridia, E. coli, pasteurellas, salmonellas, staphylococci, streptococci) has made it evident that, due to a wide distribution of resistance factors against benzylpenicillins, tetracyclines, chloramphenicol, streptomycin, macrolides and sulfonamides, the range of antibiotics for the (uncontrolled) first application has become even narrower. A testing of the pathogen in the antibiogram remains an urgent necessity.
