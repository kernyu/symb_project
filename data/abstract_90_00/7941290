Seventy one streptococci isolated from dairy cows with clinical mastitis were tested for erythromycin and lincomycin susceptibility. Ten isolates (7.1%) were resistant to erythromycin and/or lincomycin and seven were constitutive and three were inducibly resistant. Nine of the isolates hybridized with one or more of the Erm probes tested and eight isolates gave PCR products with rRNA methylase primers. The Erm determinants were transferable at frequency of 10(-5) to 10(-6) per recipient.
