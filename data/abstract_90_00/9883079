The simplest conceivable event that can occur at the gene level can result in the development of efficacious resistance tot antibiotics. The bacterial world behaves as an enormous organism whose cells can exchange their genes very easily. Accordingly, opportunities for the exchange of genetic material in nature are probably unlimited. This knowledge cannot be ignored. It leads to the important conclusion that the antibiotics are societal drugs. A resistance gene which has appeared somewhere in the world can travel far and fast.
