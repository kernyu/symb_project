Mutation rates in bacteria can vary depending on the genetic target studied and the specific growth conditions of the cells. Here, two different methods were used to determine how rates of mutation to antibiotic resistance, auxotrophy, and prototrophy were influenced by carbon starvation on agar plates. The rate of mutation to rifampin resistance was increased by starvation as measured by fluctuation tests, similar to what has been reported previously for Escherichia coli. In contrast, the rates of mutation to various types of auxotrophy were unaffected or decreased as measured by both fluctuation tests and a repeated-streaking procedure. Similarly, the rates of reversion to prototrophy of his and lac nonsense and missense mutations were unaffected by starvation. Thus, mutation rates of different genetic targets can be affected differently by starvation and we conclude that carbon starvation is not generally mutagenic in Salmonella typhimurium.
