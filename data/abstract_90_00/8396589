Outbreaks of diarrhea in child day-care centers (DCC) are common. This study was undertaken to evaluate the molecular epidemiology of an outbreak of diarrhea due to Shigella sonnei. This outbreak involved 25 of 52 (48%) DCC children and 14 of 132 (11%) teachers and household contacts. S. sonnei isolates from nine children and five contacts were characterized by antimicrobial susceptibility, plasmid content, plasmid DNA restriction fragment pattern, and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) of total genomic DNA; 33 isolates from Houston, Tex., Chicago, Ill., and Mexico City, Mexico, also were studied. All outbreak isolates were resistant to ampicillin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and shared five to six plasmids ranging from 3.3 to 70 MDa. A total of 8 of 12 temporally associated nonoutbreak Houston isolates had plasmid profiles and restriction fragment patterns similar to those of the outbreak strain, despite possessing different antibiotic susceptibility patterns. PFGE demonstrated identical DNA patterns among outbreak isolates and similar or identical patterns among temporally associated sporadic Houston isolates with plasmid profiles similar to that of the outbreak strain. All other nonoutbreak strains from Houston, Chicago, and Mexico had plasmid profiles, restriction fragment patterns, and PFGE patterns different from those of the outbreak strain. DCC outbreak isolates could be distinguished from most sporadic isolates by antimicrobial susceptibility testing, but plasmid analysis and PFGE could not differentiate common-source isolates from sporadic isolates in the same location during the same time period, indicating that isolates present in the community were genetically similar to those producing outbreaks in the DCC.
