Two shuttle vectors named pRC52 (10.7 Kb) and pRK52 (12.2 Kb) carrying chloramphenicol (Cm) and chloramphenicol plus kanamycin (Km) resistance genes, respectively, were constructed by fusion of a cryptic plasmid pBL13869 (replicon pBL1, 5.8 Kb) from Brevibacterium lactofermentum ATCC13869 with pBR328 E. coli plasmid. Transformation of Rhodococcus sp. R312 (formerly Brevibacterium sp. R312) protoplasts was realised with an efficiency of 28 transformants per micrograms of DNA.
