An experiment was undertaken between July and November 1985 in East Gippsland, Victoria, to determine the efficacy of an intra-ruminal controlled-release albendazole capsule against naturally acquired worm burdens and larval challenge in Merino hoggets. Two groups of 20 sheep, one group untreated, the other dosed with a capsule were grazed together; 5 sheep from each group were slaughtered for total worm counts 30 and 101 d after capsules were administered. Serum anthelmintic concentrations, faecal egg counts and body weights were monitored. Most capsules were exhausted within 91 d of administration. During the estimated 80 d for which they remained active the capsules were highly effective against the benzimidazole-susceptible worm populations. Faecal egg counts were reduced to zero and total worm populations were reduced by over 97% 30 d after administration. By 101 d egg counts were increasing and worm counts indicated that sheep were becoming reinfected. Sheep treated with the capsules grew faster than those not treated.
