AIM: Comparison of effectiveness of induction regimens varying in intensity and maintenance variants in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) included in a randomised multicenter trial. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Clinical trial 1 enrolled 185 AML patients. Vepesid-free induction was used in 85 patients (group 1), induction with vepesid--in 99 patients (group 2). 223 AML patients entered trial 2. Of them 37 patients were treated for 3 years 7 + 3 with daunorubicin in the dose 45 mg/m2 in the induction phase (group 1), 85 and 101 patients received 7 + 3 with daunorubicin for a year in the dose 45 mg/m2 and 60 mg/m2, respectively, (group 2 and 3). RESULTS: For group 1 in trial 1 the remission rate, early lethality, resistance were, respectively, 60, 20 and 20%, respectively. For group 2 in trial 1--66, 22 and 12%, respectively. 5-year recurrence-free survival reached 32 and 37% for group 1 and 2, respectively. For trial 2 relevant figures made up 75.5, 16.2, 8.1% for group 1; 60, 17.6 and 22.4% for group 2; 63, 20.8 and 16% for group 3, respectively. The 3.5-year recurrence-free survival in groups 1, 2 and 3, was 16, 46 and 50%, respectively. For both trials, the differences between the groups were insignificant. CONCLUSION: The results evidence that the treatment can be shorter (not 3 but 1 year or even 6 months), the induction more intensive (the dose of anthracycline antibiotics can be elevated up to 60 mg/m2 without a rise in early lethality).
