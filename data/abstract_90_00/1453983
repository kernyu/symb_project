Antimicrobial susceptibilities of sixty-five non-oral Streptococcus milleri group clinical isolates to penicillin, gentamicin, lincomycin, ampicillin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline and erythromycin were determined by an agar dilution method. All strains were penicillin-sensitive (MIC < or = 0.031 microgram/ml) and the majority (64/65) were susceptible to erythromycin (MIC < or = 0.125 microgram/ml). Low-level resistance to gentamicin was observed, and the majority of strains possessed an MIC of 8 micrograms/ml. Lincomycin and ampicillin at 0.5 microgram/ml inhibited 52/65 and 61/65 strains, respectively. Of the isolates 92% were inhibited by chloramphenicol at < or = 2 micrograms/ml. Twenty-two S. milleri group strains (of which thirteen were vaginal isolates) were resistant to tetracycline (MIC > or = 8 micrograms/ml).
