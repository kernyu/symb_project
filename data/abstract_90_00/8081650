Knockout mice with distinct gene deletions are valuable tools for in vivo analyses of the immune response against infectious agents. Studies of bacterial and protozoal infections have shown that antimicrobial immunity is generally defective in knockout mice. At one extreme, deletion of just one gene may completely compromise resistance, while at the other extreme, redundancy in the immune system allows partial compensation for the deleted part.
