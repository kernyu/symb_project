Bacillus subtilis undergoes a typical bacterial stress response when exposed to low concentrations (0.1 mM) of hydrogen peroxide. Protection is thereby induced against otherwise lethal, challenge concentrations (10 mM) of this oxidant and a number of proteins are induced including the scavenging enzymes, catalase and alkyl hydroperoxide reductase, and a putative DNA binding and protecting protein. Induced protection against higher concentrations (10-30 mM) of hydrogen peroxide is eliminated in a catalase-deficient mutant. Both RecA and Spo0A influence the basal but not the induced resistance to hydrogen peroxide. A regulatory mutation has been characterized that affects the inducible phenotype and is constitutively resistant to high concentrations of hydrogen peroxide. This mutant constitutively overexpresses the proteins induced by hydrogen peroxide in the wild-type. The resistance of spores to hydrogen peroxide is partly attributable to binding of small acid soluble proteins by the spore DNA and partly to a second step which coincides with the depletion of the NADH pool, which may inhibit the generation of hydroxyl radicals from hydrogen peroxide.
