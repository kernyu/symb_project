Seven new streptococcal integration shuttle vectors have been constructed which contain different antibiotic-resistance-encoding genes capable of expression in both Streptococcus sp. and Escherichia coli. These plasmids can replicate in E. coli, but not in streptococci because of the absence of a streptococcal origin of replication. The size, antibiotic resistance, and number of unique restriction sites available for cloning for each plasmid are as follows: pSF141 (7.6 kb, CmR and KmR, 7 sites), pSF143 (5.7 kb, TcR, 6 sites), pSF148 (7.3 kb, CmR and SpR, 7 sites), pDL285 (3.4 kb, KmR, 3 sites), pDL286 (3.1 kb, SpR, 4 sites), pSF151 (3.5 kb, KmR, 10 sites), pSF152 (3.2 kb, SpR, 9 sites). If these plasmids carry a fragment of streptococcal DNA they can specifically integrate into the chromosome via Campbell-like, homologous recombination. Therefore, they should be useful for gene inactivation, cloning, chromosomal walking, or linkage analysis in streptococci. The availability of these integration plasmids resistant to different antibiotics, along with the previously described plasmid, pVA891 (ErR), should also allow the construction of mutants possessing multiple insertionally inactivated genes useful for a variety of genetic studies.
