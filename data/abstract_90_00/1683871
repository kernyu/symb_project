We established a novel human acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line made resistant to two folate analogues, trimetrexate (TMQ) and N10-propargyl-5,8-dideazafolic acid (CB3717), by sequential exposure of the 200-fold TMQ-resistant cells (MOLT-3/TMQ200) to CB3717. A 30-fold-resistant subline to CB3717 was selected from the TMQ-resistant cells and designated as MOLT-3/TMQ200-CB371730. This double-folate-resistant cell line was 15-fold more resistant to methotrexate (MTX) than MOLT-3/TMQ200; however, TMQ resistance was decreased to 10-fold as compared to MOLT-3/TMQ200. The doubly resistant cells also showed 2-fold cross-resistance to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). Equimolar concentrations of leucovorin almost completely reversed the inhibitory effect of MTX on the doubly resistant cells and partially that of CB3717 and TMQ; on the other hand, leucovorin enhanced the inhibitory effect of 5-FU. Thymidylate synthase activities demonstrated little or no difference among these three cell lines, being consistent with no overexpression of mRNA for this enzyme in the doubly resistant cells. MOLT-3/TMQ200 cells displayed classical multidrug resistance; sequential development of CB3717 resistance in the TMQ-resistant cells resulted in an enhancement of the multidrug-resistance phenotype and a concomitant increase of MDR1 mRNA. The development of a complex resistance pattern seen in this double-folate-resistant subline indicates intricacy in the study of drug resistance after multidrug chemotherapy.
