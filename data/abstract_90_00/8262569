Plasmid profile analysis and antibiotic resistance pattern determination were carried out for 117 phage untypable S. Typhimurium strains. Majority of the strains (82%) were resistant to all the seven antibiotics tested, R-pattern being ApCmKmSmSuTcTp, rest (12%) showed heterogenous R-patterns. Plasmid DNA analysis revealed phage untypable strains to harbour large (58.8-114.3 MDal), intermediate size (36 MDal, 42 MDal) and small (1.8-5.2 MDal) plasmids with varying molecular weights. All the phage untypable strains could be subgrouped by plasmid profile analysis into 23 plasmid patterns. Plasmid profile analysis could discriminate large number of phage untypable strains on the basis of their plasmid pattern.
