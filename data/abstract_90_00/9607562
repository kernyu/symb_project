Activation of the cysteine protease caspases, which are homologous to the product of Caenorhabditis elegans cell-death gene ced 3, is required to mediate APO-1/Fas-induced apoptosis. We report here that nitric oxide (NO) released by exogenous NO donors, as well as NO endogenously derived by transfection with the inducible NO synthase, substantially suppresses APO-1/Fas-triggered cell death of Jurkat cells. The inhibitory NO effect was independent of cGMP, because 8-bromo-cGMP did not influence APO-1/Fas-mediated apoptosis. In contrast, NO interferes with the APO-1/Fas-induced stimulation of caspases. NO inhibits the proteolytic cleavage of caspase-3 (CPP32) into its active subunits, thereby suppressing caspase-3 activity. In addition, NO potently inhibits apoptosis induction by overexpresssion of the death domain protein FADD or the immediate downstream target caspase-8. These results suggest that NO modulates the proteolytic cascade upstream of caspase-3. Indeed, NO specifically S-nitrosylates caspase-8 and caspase-1 and thereby may prevent activation of the proteolytic cascade. The NO-mediated increase in the resistance toward induction of apoptosis may play a major role in mediating immune responses, as well as in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases.
