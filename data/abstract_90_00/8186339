BACKGROUND: Triple therapy for Helicobacter pylori using metronidazole is less effective in patients with a metronidazole resistant strain. Moreover, metronidazole is responsible for many side-effects. This open study examined the efficacy and side-effects of a triple treatment regimen substituting clarithromycin for metronidazole. METHODS: 36 patients with a H. pylori infection, proven by culture, were treated with tripotassium dicitrato bismuthate 120 mg q.d.s., tetracycline 250 mg q.d.s. and clarithromycin 250 mg q.d.s. for 10 days. Eradication was defined as a negative culture and histological examination of antral biopsy specimens, taken at least 6 weeks after completion of the treatment. RESULTS: Eradication was achieved in 26 patients (72%). The treatment was well tolerated with only 4 (11%) of the patients having significant side-effects. CONCLUSION: Triple therapy with clarithromycin seems to be less effective than standard triple treatment when the prevalence of metronidazole resistance is low. It is suggested, however, that this combination could be a valuable alternative in areas with a high prevalence of metronidazole resistance.
