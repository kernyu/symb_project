By conjugation experiment, an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESb1a) encoded on a transferable plasmid of approximately 60 Kilobases was found in a clinical strain of Enterobacter gergoviae isolated from Peking Union Medical College Hospital. Its E. coli transconjugant was resistant to all beta-lactams tested except cefoxitin and imipenem. Clavulanic acid, a classical beta-lactamase inhibitor, inhibited its activity. Hybridization with an intragenic probe for SHV-1 revealed that this ESb1a may be related to, or derived from SHV enzyme.
