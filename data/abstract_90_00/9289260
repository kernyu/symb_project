The in vitro drug sensitivity of three dihydrofolate reductase inhibitors (pyrimethamine, cycloguanil, trimethoprim) was determined against 29 strains and isolates of Plasmodium falciparum by an isotopic semi-microtest. Trimethoprim is less active than pyrimethamine or cycloguanil and its activity is correlated with that of two other inhibitors, suggesting cross-resistance in vitro among the dihydrofolate reductase inhibitors.
