Susceptibilities to antibiotics were determined in 36 strains of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) isolated from clinical specimens from 1990 to 1992. Rates of resistance to arbekacin and minocycline were 31% and 53%, respectively. However, all MRSA isolates were susceptible to vancomycin. MRSA was found in 12 out of 35 cases. Three infections caused by MRSA included enterocolitis (3), abscess (5), pneumonia (1), cholangitis (1), peritonitis (1) and catheter related sepsis (1). In two cases patients died with bacteremia within two years after the onset of MRSA infections.
