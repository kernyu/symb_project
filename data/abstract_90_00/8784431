The biochemical basis for the multiple resistance to aminoglycoside antibiotics (AGs) of kasugamycin-producing Streptomyces kasugaensis MB273 was studied. The strain was resistant to a wide range of deoxystreptamine (DOS)-containing AGs as well as astromicin (ASTM) group antibiotics. These AGs strongly inhibited in vitro polyU-directed polyphenylalanine-synthesis using ribosomes from the strain, while they were acetylated and inactivated by the MB273 cell free extract supplemented with acetyl-CoA. It seemed thus likely that the acetyltransferase activity played a critical role for the multiple AG resistance. The acetylation was selective to AGs with 2'-NH2, suggesting the involvement of aminoglycoside 2'-N-acetyltransferase, AAC (2'). Interestingly, the acetylation of istamycin B (ISM-B; an ASTM group AG) resulted in the formation of two different products (1-N-acetyl ISM-B and 2"-N-acetyl ISM-B) at a similar ratio. In this context, an AAC (2') gene cloned as an ISM-B resistance gene from the strain MB273 directed the conversion of ISM-B to only 1-N-acetyl ISM-B. It seemed likely that two types of AACs [AAC(2') and a novel one] were involved in the mechanism of resistance to ASTM group AGs.
