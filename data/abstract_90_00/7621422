Bcl-2 expression has been associated with progression of prostate cancer from androgen-dependence to androgen-independence and may contribute to the relative drug-resistant phenotype typically observed in androgen-independent prostate cancer. Dunning-G rat prostate cancer cells transfected with a bcl-2 expression vector demonstrated resistance to apoptosis induced by adriamycin and, to a lesser extent, suramin. Use of adriamycin and suramin in combination, however, circumvents this bcl-2 associated drug resistance. Our findings indicate that combination drug actions may induce apoptosis in resistant malignant cell types with defective apoptotic pathways.
