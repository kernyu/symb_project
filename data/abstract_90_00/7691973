A 24-year-old male with chronic renal failure on Continuous Ambulatory Peritoneal Dialysis (CAPD) complained of cough and dyspnea. Chest X-ray film showed a pneumonia shadow and MRSA and Candida krusei were detected in the sputum. Pneumonia improved with vancomycin and fluconazole. Treatment with methylprednisolone was needed for retinodialysis. After this treatment, pneumonia deteriorated. Pneumonia did not improve with vancomycin and anti-fungal agents. This severe pneumonia was improved with a combination therapy of vancomycin, miconazole and G-CSF. A combination therapy of antibiotics and G-CSF is considered to be effective for severe pneumonia.
