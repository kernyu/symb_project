We report the first isolation of Candida dubliniensis in Argentina. This strain was isolated from an oral lesion of an adult patient with AIDS during one recurrent episode of a previously treated oropharingeal candidosis. Phenotypic and genotypic characteristics coincided with those described by Sullivan et al., who was the first to study this new species.
