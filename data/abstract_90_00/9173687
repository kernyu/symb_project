BASIC PROBLEM AND OBJECTIVE OF STUDY: The situation of pretherapeutical antimicrobial drug resistance of Helicobacter pylori has therapeutical implications. For this reason the present study was designed to evaluate the frequency of resistance in Germany. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 201 H. pylori isolates cultured on the basis of biopsies taken by routine gastroscopies were tested for resistance by E-test. The antibiotics examined were amoxicillin, tetracycline, clarithromycin and metronidazole. For further analysis the last 101 patients were asked for demographical and clinical data that were evaluated for a correlation with metronidazole resistance. RESULTS: Pretherapeutical resistance against amoxicillin and tetracycline was not detected. The rate of drug resistance against clarithromycin came to 3% and against metronidazole to 29%. There was a higher incidence of metronidazole resistance in female patients (Odds ratio 1.71; p = n.s.). Reliable predictors for metronidazole resistance, however, could not be identified. CONCLUSIONS: About 30% of H. pylori isolates are pretherapeutically resistant to metronidazole. Resistance to clarithromycin is still rare, but further monitoring remains necessary to detect changes in the community.
