A set of fragmentation vectors is described which produce a deletion series of smaller yeast artificial chromosomes (YACs) from a larger parent YAC with the insertion of a eukaryotic selectable marker. In addition, new vectors were designed to permit integration of the genes encoding neomycin (neo) or hygromycin B (hyg) resistance into YACs containing inserts of human DNA. All these vectors are compatible with the yeast host strain AB1380, in which most human genomic YAC libraries are maintained. Linearized vector DNA is used to transform yeast cells in which homologous recombination between human DNA in the YAC and the Alu sequence in the fragmentation or integrating vector produces terminal deletions from the acentromeric (URA3) end of the YAC or insertion of the vector into the YAC, respectively. A set of directional deletions of a YAC is useful for genomic mapping, restriction analysis and functional measurements of large chromosomal regions. The neo and hyg eukaryotic markers permit the study of gene function after introduction of deleted YACs into mammalian cells. Transformation of YACs with the fragmentation vectors resulted in fragmentation in 21-46% of the clones examined; transformation with the integrating vector resulted in integration in 46% of the clones examined.
