Individual protection against Plasmodium falciparum malaria is based on a simultaneous observance of a preservation from mosquitos bites during the night and an adapted chemioprophylaxis. It is suitable to personalize chemioprophylaxis advices according to the ground (intolerance to anti paludic drugs, drugs interactions, pregnancy...) to the context of the transmission (visited countries, seasons, resistance level of malaria strains) and at last the local way of the medical assistance under taken against this disease. Nevertheless, it is good to remind that there is no preventive mean which gives full protection by itself. All fever that happens after a trip in an endemic zone for malaria has to be considered firstly as due to malaria and investigations have to be made under this condition.
