The genetic characterization of a foscarnet-resistant strain of varicella-zoster virus (VZV) that was isolated from a patient with AIDS is reported. Compared with the sequence of the Dumas reference strain, this strain, which was isolated from a patient in whom foscarnet treatment failed, had two point mutations. The emergence of one of the mutations, which includes a change from a glutamic acid to a lysine at position 512 in the DNA polymerase, suggests that this mutation is implicated in the VZV foscarnet resistance. The other mutation, which replaces serine 863 by a glycine, is also present in 2 susceptible strains--Oka and a wild-type isolate.
