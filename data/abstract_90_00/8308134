By comparison with agar dilution results, the E test was investigated for the ability to detect high-level aminoglycoside (gentamicin and streptomycin), ampicillin, and vancomycin resistance among strains representing six enterococcal species. For ampicillin and vancomycin, disk diffusion results also were obtained. No false high-level aminoglycoside resistance occurred, and no false gentamicin susceptibility was noted. With the high-range streptomycin E test (2,048 micrograms), 24% of the 38 resistant strains were falsely susceptible. However, these discordances could likely be reconciled by adjustments in incubation duration and by using broth microdilution rather than agar screen breakpoint criteria, or by using the lower-range (1,024-micrograms) strip. For ampicillin, category results obtained by E test and disk diffusion showed good agreement with agar dilution; E test MICs were generally comparable to agar dilution MICs. The E test was more sensitive than disk diffusion for detecting vancomycin-intermediate strains, but for these strains and those exhibiting low-level vancomycin resistance (MIC, 32 to 128 micrograms/ml), disk diffusion and E test inhibition zones must be interpreted with caution. Given the reliability of E test for detecting resistance to anti-enterococcal agents, the decision to use this method should be based on convenience, cost, testing frequency, and satisfaction with currently used methods.
