Campylobacter jejuni was inoculated into a range of raw and cooked foods and survival determined during storage at 2 degrees, 10 degrees and 20 degrees C for up to 56 d. To facilitate easy enumeration, two antibiotic-resistant strains of Camp. jejuni, which had similar survival characteristics to the parent strain, were used. Campylobacter jejuni survived for longer at lower temperatures in all foods and inactivation was most rapid in pate. There was generally good agreement between the survival data and predictions from a Camp. jejuni survival model (Food MicroModel).
