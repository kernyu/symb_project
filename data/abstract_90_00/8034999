We describe the first reported case in the literature of bacterial endocarditis caused by Enterococcus faecium that was highly resistant to gentamicin. The case is unusual in that it followed a successfully treated Streptococcus sanguis endocarditis. The micro-organism was susceptible only to the glycopeptide antibiotics, vancomycin and teicoplanin and to agents such as pristinamycin and daptomycin which are not routinely available for treatment. It illustrates the therapeutic dilemma posed by serious infections with such micro-organisms and supports previous observations that early heart valve replacement surgery may be necessary to achieve cure of endocarditis due to enterococci which are highly resistant to gentamicin. It further emphasises the importance of screening for high-level aminoglycoside resistance in enterococci in all life threatening enterococcal infections, including endocarditis, septicaemia and meningitis when aminoglycoside-penicillin synergy is required for successful treatment.
