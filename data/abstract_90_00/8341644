The transactivator of transcription, Tat, of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is required for viral replication. Inhibition of Tat function could have the potential to keep integrated provirus in dormancy. In the presence of Tat, Ro 24-7429, an analog of Ro 5-3335, inhibited expression of indicator genes controlled by the HIV-1 long terminal repeat promoter in transient transfection assays and in a constitutive cell line at noncytotoxic concentrations. Reduction of steady-state mRNA of the indicator gene by the compound correlated with reduction of the gene product in the constitutive cell line. Ro 24-7429 has broad activity against several strains of HIV-1 in different cell lines, peripheral blood lymphocytes, and macrophages (IC90 = 1-3 microM). Importantly, Ro 24-7429 inhibited viral replication in both acute and chronic infection in vitro, a characteristic expected of a Tat antagonist and not shared by viral reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Consistent with this, the compound reduced cell-associated viral RNA and proteins and partially restored cell-surface CD4 in chronically infected cells. After 2 years of continued weekly passage of the virus in fresh CEM cells grown in the presence of the compound at 1 or 10 microM, the virus did not develop resistance to the drug. These results indicate that the compound's action might involve a cellular factor.
