Chloroquine is still the drug of choice for first-line treatment of uncomplicated malaria in Madagascar. However development and spread of chloroquine-resistance could compromise this therapeutic strategy in the future. The purpose of this 1997 study was to compare the efficacy of combined treatment using sulfadoxine and pyrimethamine and single-agent treatment using chloroquine for management of uncomplicated malaria. Study data were collected at four sites in coastal areas of Madagascar where transmission of malaria is perennial. Prevalence of malaria ranged from 15 p. 100 to 22 p. 100 in school children and from 24 p. 100 to 72 p. 100 in outpatient consulting spontaneously at community health centers. All four Plasmodium species affecting man were identified. Plasmodium falciparum was involved in 83 p. 100 of cases. In vivo testing of the susceptibility of Plasmodium falciparum to chloroquine was performed in 149 patients according to the standard simplified 7-day protocol of the WHO. The 35 tests in school children demonstrated no evidence of resistance. However type R1 + R2 resistance was noted in 17 of the 114 tests performed on outpatients, i.e. 14.9 p. 100. In vitro testing demonstrated chloroquine resistance in four of the 90 specimens tested, i.e. 4.4 p. 100. With regard to combined sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine treatment, 45 of 46 in vivo tests in outpatients showed no evidence of resistance. Combination treatment was more effective than single-agent treatment (p = 0.02) and could offer an effective alternative for future use.
