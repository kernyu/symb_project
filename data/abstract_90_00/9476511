The significance of Candida albicans in the development of denture stomatitis (DS), as well as the clinical and microbiological efficacy of treatment with fluconazole and itraconazole was studied in 115 patients affected with DS and 200 controls (100 healthy patients with dental prosthesis and 100 healthy patients without prosthesis). Specimens were taken from all patients; subsequently all patients with positive culture of the DS group were treated with fluconazole. A second specimen was taken after 15 days of treatment with fluconazole, and if the results were positive again, treatment with itraconazole was instituted and the patients were given appointments for taking a third specimen. The incidence of C. albicans was 92% in the group of patients with DS. After treatment with fluconazole, a clinical cure of 97% and a microbiological cure of 78% was obtained in the patients with DS. In 3.2% of the cases strains resistant to fluconazole were found. The cases of microbiological resistance to fluconazole were treated with itraconazole resulting in a clinical cure of 100% and a microbiological cure of 77%. The results show the poor correlation of the clinico-microbiological response after treatment with these antifungal agents in denture stomatitis.
