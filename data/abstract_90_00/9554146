The aim of the study was to find out whether methicillin-resistant S. aureus strains (MRSA) are tolerant in a higher degree to disinfectants, and whether a correlation exists between lower sensitivity to these agents and resistance to gentamicin. The study was carried out on 30 strains of MRSA and 20 of MSSA isolated from various clinical materials in various regions of the country. Among the studied MRSA 24 strains were resistant and 6 were sensitive to gentamicin, and in MSSA 3 strains were resistant and 17 sensitive to this antibiotic. The sensitivity to four disinfectants: Manusan, Sterinol, Septyl R and Lysoformin Spezial was determined by measurement of MIC (minimal inhibitory concentration) in agar medium. Most MRSA in Poland showed decreased sensitivity to these disinfectants. Among gentamicin-sensitive and resistant MRSA strains the proportions of strains with higher tolerance of three disinfectants (Manusan, Sterinol and Lysoformin Spezial) were very similar. Reduced sensitivity to disinfectants was found in all gentamicin-resistant MSSA. These data indicate that S. aureus strains possess various mechanisms of tolerance of disinfectants. Nearly half the studied strains (46%) had decreased sensitivity to all three preparations (Manusan, Sterinol and Lysoformin Spezial) belonging to various chemical groups this seems to indicate that increased tolerance to these disinfectants is a non-specific feature of S. aureus strains.
