Salmonella meningitis is a rare clinical entity that occurs mainly during early infancy. Treatment of Salmonella infections may be complicated by the bacteria's growing resistance to clinically important antimicrobial agents, especially third-generation cephalosporins. A report is presented of a newborn infant with Salmonella meningitis who relapsed after 4 weeks of cefotaxime treatment and was cured completely with imipenem cilastatin therapy.
