Recently, a novel culture medium for detecting live yeast cells of Paracoccidioides brasiliensis was developed by Kurita et al. Using this culture medium, murine peritoneal polymorphonuclear leucocytes (PMN) were examined for fungistatic and fungicidal activities against P. brasiliensis yeast cells. The magnitude of the antifungal effect of PMN varied depending upon the fungal isolates used. PMN exhibited a killing effect on P. brasiliensis isolate Bt-4 in 2 h of coculture. In contrast, the other three fungal isolates employed were resistant to killing by PMN. However, PMN considerably suppressed the growth of isolates Tatu and Recife in a long-term assay (approximately 72 h). The growth of isolate Bt-9 was also suppressed by PMN during the first 24 h, but was found to be considerably promoted at 72 h of coculture. Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), but not tumour-necrosis factor-alpha, significantly augmented the antifungal activity of PMN. IFN-gamma-treated PMN exhibited a killing effect on isolates Tatu, Recife and Bt-9 after 24 h of coculture, and showed an enhanced killing effect on isolate Bt-4. Contact between PMN and fungal cells was required for PMN to exert the antifungal effect. Our results suggest that PMN, whether activated with cytokines or not, might play a critical role in host resistance in early infection with this fungus by buying time for development of more effective immunologic responses.
