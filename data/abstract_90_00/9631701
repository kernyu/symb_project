OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy of moxidectin to ivermectin, oxibendazole and morantel against some gastrointestinal nematodes in horses. DESIGN: Faecal egg count reduction after treatment. PROCEDURE: A farm was selected where the population of small strongyles in horses was known to be resistant to oxibendazole. Horses were allocated to treatment groups based on faecal egg counts. After treatment, faecal samples were taken up to 109 days after treatment and faecal egg counts estimated. Faecal cultures were used to estimate the contribution of small and large strongyles to the faecal egg counts at each sampling. RESULTS: Moxidectin (0.4 mg/kg) suppressed faecal egg counts for 109 days after treatment in most horses compared to 40 days with ivermectin (0.2 mg/kg), 13 days with morantel (9.4 mg/kg) and less than 13 days with oxibendazole (10 mg/kg). Most of the faecal egg count was attributable to small strongyles based on faecal culture, although Strongylus vulgaris was present in some samples in low numbers. Oxibendazole resistance in small strongyles was confirmed and a less than expected efficacy of morantel was also seen. CONCLUSION: Moxidectin was highly effective in reducing faecal egg counts after treatment for at least 12 weeks and up to 16 weeks in most horses. These horses were infected with a population of small strongyles known to be resistant to oxibendazole and possibly morantel. The duration of the reduction in faecal egg counts after treatment with moxidectin (0.4 mg/kg) was at least twice that of ivermectin (0.2 mg/kg) and greater than four times that for morantel and oxibendazole.
