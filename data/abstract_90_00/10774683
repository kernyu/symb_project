A survey was conducted to find chloroquine concentration profile in the community of Mewat region district Gurgaon (Haryana) of India. 88 P. falciparum and 3 P. vivax cases were detected out of 148 blood slides examined with a SPR of 61.48. Plasma chloroquine and desethylchloroquine concentrations were determined in 55 P. falciparum and 2 P. vivax patients and 29 persons whose blood slides were negative for malaria parasite before giving any treatment. Mean chloroquine concentrations in cases with P. falciparum parasites and without malaria parasites were 0.018 and 0.016 microg ml(-1) respectively. Chloroquine to desethyl chloroquine ratio was between 2 and 3 in both groups. Only 10 malaria parasite negative cases out of 29 had plasma chloroquine concentrations above 0.016 microg ml(-1) required for malaria chemoprophylaxis. Chloroquine was undetectable in plasma samples of 8 out of 55 P. falciparum cases. Chloroquine plasma concentrations in 21 P. falciparum cases were below therapeutically effective concentration of 0.016 microg ml(-1) suggesting improper treatment while in 29 P. falciparum cases, parasitemia recurred despite required chloroquine concentration confirming chloroquine resistant status. Irregular prophylaxis and lack of proper treatment was one of the major causes of malaria outbreak in this area.
