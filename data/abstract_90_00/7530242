Multi-resistant strains from three UK centres, previously identified as Burkholderia (formerly Pseudomonas) cepacia, and associated with morbidity, mortality and transmission among patients with cystic fibrosis have been further characterised. Biochemical tests and fatty acid analyses indicate these strains to possess some characteristics atypical of B. cepacia but bearing close resemblance to Burkholderia gladioli, an organism previously regarded solely as a plant pathogen and a hindrance to the identification of B. cepacia. In contrast to the majority of reference strains, all multi-resistant clinical isolates possessed rough lipopolysaccharide which may be a major factor responsible for their increased antibiotic resistance and virulence. In view of the potential clinical and social problems in CF patients posed by these multi-resistant strains, it would seem prudent to consider the isolation of either B. cepacia or B. gladioli as of equal significance.
