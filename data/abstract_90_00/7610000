The sensitivity to some non-radiation agents in mice which displayed an increased radioresistance 12 days following sublethal radiation was investigated. The animals demonstrated no enhanced cross-resistance to acute hypoxia, injections of KCN, strychnine, sarcolysine, hexenal. Resistance to typhoid fever endotoxin as well as the indices of nonspecific antimicrobial host defense (NBT-test, segregative activity of RES, white blood cell counts, antibody production ability) were reduced as compared with those of intact mice. The serum corticosterone level was normal.
