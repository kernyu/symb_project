The Staphylococcus aureus isolates were all susceptible to vancomycin. More than 90% of the isolates were susceptible to rifampicin, ampiclox, methicillin, erythromycin and clindamycin. The isolates were highly resistant to the beta-lactamase-sensitive penicillins, that is 91, 93.2 and 70.4% of the isolates were resistant to penicillin, ampicillin and carbinicillin. Twelve plasmids were found in the isolates, the 35 and 11 Mdal plasmids coded for aminoglycosides and tetracycline resistances, respectively.
