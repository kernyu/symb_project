Regions of possible interaction between remantadine and transmembrane M2 protein are revealed by analysis of amino acid substitutions in remantadine- and deutiforin-resistant influenza viruses. The major region includes 5-6 amino acid residues at position 25-31, partially involving the premembrane region and the first position of a hydrophobic membrane-associated domain. The proposed model action of remantadine and its derivatives suggests that remantadine is included into the cell membrane lipid bimolecular layer by its adamantane share and its positively charged NH2-group is exposed to the cell surface. This allows remantadine and its analog to be regarded as molecular "hindrances" for viral particle decapsidation and budding.
