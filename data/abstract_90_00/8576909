Bacterial resistance development has become a very serious clinical problem for many classes of antibiotics. The 3-aryl-2-oxazolidinones are a relatively new class of synthetic antibacterial agents, having a new mechanism of action which involves very early inhibition of bacterial protein synthesis. We have prepared two potent, synthetic oxazolidinones, U-100592 and U-100766, which are currently in clinical development for the treatment of serious multidrug-resistant Gram-positive bacterial infections caused by strains of staphylococci, streptococci, and enterococci. The in vitro and in vivo (po and iv) activities of U-100592 and U-100766 against representative strains are similar to those of vancomycin. U-100592 and U-100766 demonstrate potent in vitro activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis. A novel and practical asymmetric synthesis of (5S)-(acetamidomethyl)-2-oxazolidinones has been developed and is employed for the synthesis of U-100592 and U-100766. This involves the reaction of N-lithioarylcarbamates with (R)-glycidyl butyrate, resulting in excellent yields and high enantiomeric purity of the intermediate (R)-5-(hydroxymethyl)-2-oxazolidinones.
