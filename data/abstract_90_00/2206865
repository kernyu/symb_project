From 1984 to 1987 two consecutive groups of juvenile cancer patients (n = 45) with fever and neutropenia corresponding in all criteria were examined. In half of the total of 90 febrile episodes and septicemias, a conventional antibiotic combination therapy (Pseudomonas-active penicillin/cephalosporin of the third generation/aminoglycoside) was instituted. In the remaining half imipenem was used as an antibiotic monoagent. In 66% and 60% of the febrile episodes treated with antibiotic combination therapy and with imipenem, respectively, septicemia was confirmed by positive blood cultures. Nineteen febrile episodes occurred in the myeloaplastic phase after bone marrow transplantation. In a comparative study of imipenem as monotherapy versus an antibiotic combination therapy the results obtained with imipenem were superior in many regards. No resistance developed necessitating change of antibiotic therapy. Coagulase-negative Staphylococci, primarily responsible for catheter-associated septicemia, were susceptible. Duration of fever and thus duration of treatment were shorter. The incidence of side effects and costs were lower. Therefore, imipenem as an antibiotic monotherapy in febrile cancer patients with neutropenia appears to be more efficacious than the conventional combination therapy, even during myeloaplasia following bone marrow transplantation. The results and rationale of this retrospective analysis are discussed.
