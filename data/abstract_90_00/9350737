Mutations in a 69-bp region of the rpoB gene of Mycobacterium tuberculosis are associated with rifampin resistance (Rif[r]). These have been detected with mycobacterial DNA extracted from bacterial suspensions or respiratory specimens that were acid-fast smear positive. We experimented with a strategy for the rapid detection of Rif(r) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples. The strategy involves the amplification of the 69-bp region of rpoB by means of PCR and the identification of nucleotide mutations by single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis of the amplification products. Sixty-five CSF specimens collected from 29 patients (19 patients were coinfected with human immunodeficiency virus) with culture or autopsy-confirmed (22 patients) or highly probable (7 patients) tuberculosis of the central nervous system (CNS-TB) were processed. Amplified products suitable for evaluation by SSCP analysis were obtained from 37 CSF specimens from 25 subjects (86.2%). PCR-SSCP of CSF correctly identified the rifampin susceptibility phenotype of isolates from all 17 patients for whom the results of susceptibility tests carried out with strains cultured from CSF or respiratory samples were available. Moreover, this assay revealed the rifampin susceptibility genotype of isolates from the eight patients (three patients with culture-confirmed CNS-TB and five patients in whom CNS-TB was highly probable) for whom no susceptibility test results were available; the PCR-SSCP data obtained for these patients were concordant with the outcome after a standard antituberculosis treatment. The evolution of a mutation in the rpoB gene was documented in a patient during the course of treatment. PCR-SSCP analysis of CSF seems to be an efficacious method of predicting Rif(r) and would reduce the time required for susceptibility testing from approximately 4 to 8 weeks to a few days.
