Ceftazidime is a third generation cephalosporin antibacterial agent which, since its introduction in the early 1980s, has retained a broad spectrum of in vitro antimicrobial activity and clinical utility in serious infections. However, increasing resistance to ceftazidime and other third generation cephalosporins, particularly among Enterobacteriaceae, due to the emergence of plasmid-mediated extended spectrum beta-lactamases and the class I chromosomally mediated beta-lactamases, is of concern. There is now a wealth of information on the pharmacokinetics of the drug. enabling ceftazidime to be used predictably, and with a low potential for adverse effects, in a diversity of patient populations. Overall, ceftazidime remains an effective agent for the treatment of serious infection, particularly those due to major nosocomial pathogens, and respiratory infections in patients with cystic fibrosis. Ceftazidime-containing regimens also remain an important option for the empirical therapy of febrile episodes in neutropenic patients. The tolerability profile of ceftazidime makes the drug a useful option in seriously ill patients who are at risk of developing adverse events with other antibacterial agents. Although patterns of bacterial resistance have changed in the ensuing years since its introduction, judicious use of this important agent will help maintain its present clinical utility.
