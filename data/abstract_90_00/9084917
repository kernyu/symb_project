Synercid (quinupristin/dalfopristin, RP59500) is a new water-soluble streptogramin which offers some advantages over the commercially available antimicrobials against drug-resistant gram-positive bacteria. Its in vitro activity was compared with ampicillin, augmentin, penicillin, erythromycin, oxacillin and vancomycin against gram-positive bacteria isolated from clinical specimens. Of the 837 gram-positive bacteria tested 834 (99.6%) were inhibited by < 0.6-4.0 mg/l of Synercid. It had excellent activity against both staphylococci and streptococci, including methicillin-resistant staphylococci and vancomycin-resistant enterococci.
