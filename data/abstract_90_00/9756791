The activities of a panel of currently available antibiotics and the investigational agents LY 333328, linezolid, CL 331,002, CL 329,998, moxifloxacin (BAY 12-8039), trovafloxacin, and quinupristin-dalfopristin against 274 clinical isolates of enterococci were determined. No vancomycin resistance or beta-lactamase production was observed. Except for 12 isolates (all non-Enterococcus faecalis) showing reduced susceptibility to quinupristin-dalfopristin (MIC, >/=4 microg/ml), the new agents exhibited promising in vitro antienterococcal activity.
