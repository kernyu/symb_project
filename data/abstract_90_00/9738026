Although reliable detection of resistance in vitro is critical to the overall performance of any susceptibility testing method, the recently released National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards M27-A methodology for susceptibility testing of yeasts discriminates poorly between resistant and susceptible isolates of Candida spp. We have previously shown that both substitution of antibiotic medium 3 for RPMI 1640 medium in the microdilution variant of the M27-A method and use of the E-test agar diffusion methodology permit detection of amphotericin B-resistant Candida isolates. To determine the relevance of these observations to Cryptococcus neoformans, we have evaluated the performances of both the M27-A and the E-test methodologies with this yeast using three different media (RPMI 1640 medium, antibiotic medium 3, and yeast nitrogen base). As with Candida, we found that only antibiotic medium 3 permitted consistent detection of resistant isolates when testing was performed in broth by the M27-A method. When testing was performed by the E-test agar diffusion method, both RPMI 1640 medium and antibiotic medium 3 agar permitted ready detection of the resistant isolates. Reading of the results after 48 h of incubation was required for testing in broth by the M27-A method, while the MIC could be determined after either 48 or 72 h when the agar diffusion method was used.
