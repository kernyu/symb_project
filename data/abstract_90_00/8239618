Ceftazidime-resistant isolates of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae produced a plasmid-mediated beta-lactamase with a pI of 5.6 with biochemical characteristics comparable to those of the TEM-10 beta-lactamase. Plasmids from the two strains were nonidentical. Both TEM-10 sequences differed from TEM-1 by substitutions of Ser-162 and Lys-237. The nucleotide sequences of the two genes were identical except for three silent nucleotide substitutions corresponding to the nucleotide differences in the Tn2 TEM-1 or Tn3 TEM-1 genes. The original TEM-10 plasmid was identical to that found in the E. coli isolate and coded for a gene that corresponded to the TEM-10 beta-lactamase from Tn2.
