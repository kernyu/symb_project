To elucidate the relationship between cyclosporine (Cs) nephrotoxicity and renal blood flow (RBF), we carried our experiments using rats. Adult male Wistar strain rats each weighing about 100 g were used. Rats were divided into 2 groups; the Cs group (Cs 50 mg/kg/day was intraperitoneally given for 10 consecutive days) and the control group (normal saline solution for 10 consecutive days). The renal cortical blood flow was measured in each group by electrolytic hydrogen gas clearance method. We also carried out renal angiography with barium sulfate (BaSO4). Then we measured blood vessel area/renal sagittal section area ratio and the diameter of interlobar arteries. The Cs group showed a significant decrease of renal cortical blood flow compared with the control group. On the other hand there was no significant change in renal angiogram. In conclusion, Cs decreased renal cortical blood flow. We suppose that vascular resistance increased following afferent arteriolopathy caused by Cs administration.
