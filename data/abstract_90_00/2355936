The lethal effect of polychromatic near-UV light (325-400 nm) on Haemophilus influenzae was 8 times higher under aerobic than anaerobic irradiation. This light increased the frequency of mutation to novobiocin resistance and ability to utilize protoporphyrin IX. The slope of mutagenic effect at low doses appeared greater for the aerobic than for the anaerobic group. We concluded that polychromatic near-UV mutation of H. influenzae under anaerobic irradiation was caused by direct oxygen-independent action on DNA.
