Visceral leishmaniasis is caused by hemoflagellate protozoa which are obligatory parasites of the mononuclear phagocyte system. Leishmaniasis causes high morbidity and mortality worldwide. The treatment of choice remains pentavalent antimonials, but high toxicity and failures have been reported. An alternative to conventional treatment is delivery anti-leishmania agents using colloidal carrier systems. Carriers improve drug activity against intracellular disease involving the mononuclear phagocyte system. The principle of drug delivery by carrier systems has been applied successfully for anticancer drugs. Recently complete remission of polyresistant visceral leishmaniasis was obtained by injection of liposomal amphotericin B. At present, no colloidal drug carrier for antimony derivatives is available, but pentamidine can be linked experimentally to methacrylate polymer nano-particles. Drug-loaded nanoparticles have been shown to be effective against amastigote leishmania both in vitro and in vivo. Another colloidal system of major interest for drug delivery, the liposome has already been loaded with amphotericin B and used for human therapy. The concept of particulate drug carriers opens the way for new chemotherapeutic approaches in the field of parasitology.
