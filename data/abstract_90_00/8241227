Cyclosporine is associated with renal insufficiency characterized by a reduction in glomerular filtration rate that may result from renal vasoconstriction. Injection of cyclosporine in the isolated renal artery perfused at a constant flow induces a potent dose-dependent vasoconstriction of renal arterial vessels in the dog. The present study was designed to investigate the role of thromboxane A2, angiotensin, and endothelial-dependent vasodilation in the cyclosporine-induced renal vasoconstriction. A specific thromboxane A2-receptor antagonist (pinane-thromboxane A2), administered at a dose of 150 micrograms, significantly decreased the renal vasoconstriction response to cyclosporine from 103 +/- 26 mm Hg to 45 +/- 11 mm Hg (p < 0.05), with cyclosporine serum levels at the end of injection averaging 382 +/- 105 and 421 +/- 150 nmol/L before and after injection of the antagonist. In contrast, pharmacologic blockade of angiotensin receptors by saralasin had no effect on the cyclosporine arterial vasoconstriction in the kidney. The endothelium-dependent vasodilation to acetylcholine was not modified during cyclosporine injection. Thus cyclosporine renal vasoconstriction appears independent of the renin-angiotensin system and of endothelium-dependent vasodilation. It is at least partly mediated by thromboxane A2. Prevention of cyclosporine vasoconstriction by thromboxane A2-receptor antagonist may likely be possible, with more potent agents having more affinity to thromboxane A2 renal receptors.
