The efficacy and safety of a once-a-day antibiotic in the treatment of sinusitis was studied. Two randomly assigned groups were treated with either once-a-day cefixime, a third generation cephalosporin, or amoxicillin three times a day. One hundred and fourteen patients were evaluated with antral punctures, microbiologic evaluation, and radiographic studies. Cultures revealed 40% gram-negative organisms, 48% gram-positive, and 12% anaerobes. The most common bacteria were Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus and viridans group streptococci. Ninety-four percent of the cefixime group were cured compared with 96% of the amoxicillin group. Staphylococcus resistance was a problem in both groups, necessitating an occasional change to amoxicillin-clavulanate potassium in the amoxicillin group. Once-a-day antibiotics offer the potential for improved compliance in the treatment of sinusitis. Cefixime offers an additional benefit of covering beta-lactamase producing strains of bacteria which are increasing in incidence and resistant to many penicillins.
