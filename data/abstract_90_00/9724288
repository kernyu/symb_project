We have previously shown that ANG II increases microvascular permeability in normal dog lungs but not after pacing-induced heart failure. This study investigated how ANG II induces permeability in isolated blood-perfused canine lung lobes and what alterations occur during heart failure. In normal lobes, the protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitors staurosporine (500 nM) or chelerythrine (10 microM) did not modify ANG II-induced increases in the capillary filtration coefficient (Kf,c, ml . min-1 . cmH2O-1 . 100 g-1; an index of microvascular permeability), suggesting that PKC is not involved. Thapsigargin (150 nM) was used to stimulate capacitative Ca2+ entry in lobes from control dogs and dogs paced at 245 beats/min for 4 wk to induce heart failure. In control lobes, Kf,c rose after thapsigargin, from 0.06 +/- 0.01 to 0.17 +/- 0.03 ml . min-1 . cmH2O-1 . 100 g-1 (mean +/- SE, P < 0.05) but did not change in the paced group. A Ca2+ ionophore, A-23187, increased Kf,c in both control (10 microM; 0.05 +/- 0.01 to 0.17 +/- 0.05 ml . min-1 . cmH2O-1 . 100 g-1, P < 0.05) and pace (5 microM; 0.06 +/- 0.01 to 0. 21 +/- 0.07 ml . min-1 . cmH2O-1 . 100 g-1, P < 0.05) lobes, indicating that increasing intracellular Ca2+ is sufficient to induce pulmonary microvascular permeability after pacing. We conclude that during heart failure, Ca2+ signaling within the pulmonary microvascular endothelium is altered.
