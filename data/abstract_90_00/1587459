Six Campylobacter jejuni clinical isolates were examined for the occurrence of plasmids in association with antibiotic resistances as well as conjugal transfer. All the isolates were found to carry three similar plasmids of 78 kb, 12.6 kb and 3.3 kb in size. Multiple resistance to at least three of the antibiotics tested was observed with resistance to tetracycline most common. En bloc transfer of donor resistances at frequencies ranging from 10(-8) to 10(-4) were seen in all but one of the isolates during conjugation. The conjugal transfer of erythromycin, neomycin and streptomycin were observed to occur at frequencies similar to that of chloramphenicol, kanamycin and tetracycline. In isolate ABA94, three different antibiotic resistance phenotypes of the transconjugants were seen. In addition to en bloc transfer of the donor resistances, in approximately 10% of the transconjugants the streptomycin resistance was lost although these transconjugants carried the donor complement of three plasmids. In a further 1% of the transconjugants, resistance to kanamycin only was detected and these transconjugants did not carry any plasmids.
