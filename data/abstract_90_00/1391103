This study was carried out on 63 patients in the town of Gadaref in eastern Sudan; each patient was given the standard therapeutic dose of chloroquine (CQ). Plasma levels of chloroquine and its major metabolite desethylchloroquine (DCQ) were measured by means of a high-performance liquid chromatographic method (HPLC) in patients infected with sensitive (sensitive group) and resistant (resistant groups) strains of Plasmodium falciparum. The ratios of chloroquine to desethylchloroquine (CQ/DCQ) in different groups were calculated and the results obtained were compared and correlated with the degree of parasitaemia. The statistical analysis of the results showed that the plasma content of CQ and the CQ/DCQ ratio in the majority of the patients fall within the normal mode of distribution. A small group of patients showed a deviation from the normal mode by having a rather high CQ plasma level and a high ratio of CQ/DCQ. The mean plasma levels of CQ and the CQ/DCQ ratio in the sensitive group was found to be higher than that in the resistant groups. However, these differences were found to be not significant. Correlation tests showed that the levels of CQ and the CQ/DCQ ratios increase with the increase of the degree of parasitaemia in the sensitive group but decrease with the increase of parasitaemia in resistant groups.
