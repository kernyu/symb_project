The influence of free-radical oxidation inhibitors (alpha tocopherol) and stimulators (levamisole and alriblastin) on the processes of the peroxide oxidation of lipids in blood serum and the phagocytic activity of peripheral blood neutrophils in Salmonella infection in rabbits at an early age is accompanied by phasic changes in the peroxide oxidation of lipids with activation at the early period of the development of the infection. The synchronism of changes in the peroxide oxidation of lipids and in the phagocytic activity of neutrophils is observed. Alpha tocopherol inhibits the peroxide oxidation of lipids and decreases the degree of the completeness of phagocytosis. Alriblastin stimulates the peroxide oxidation of lipids and increases the phagocytic activity of neutrophils.
