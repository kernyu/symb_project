Optimistic results were obtained in the treatment of 39 patients with surgically incurable metastatic malignant melanoma using a regimen including 2 to 3 monthly induction cycles of cis-diamminedichloroplatinum (CDDP), recombinant interleukin-2 (rIL-2) and interferon alpha-2a (IFN alpha-2a). 33 of 39 patients were pretreated with chemotherapy (dacarbazine and/or fotemustine:31, CDDP:6) and 17 of 39 with IFN alpha-2a. Overall response rate was 54% with 13% achieving a complete response for up to 59+ weeks. Moderate to severe side-effects were reversible on rIL-2 cessation and toxicity was manageable in a routine inpatient setting. These results are especially encouraging as they were seen in previously treated patients, classically low responders, including 3 who were resistant to cisplatin or other platinum complexes. The question remains if this regimen bypasses traditional mechanisms of drug resistance.
