Nikkomycin Z inhibits chitin synthase in vitro but does not exhibit antifungal activity against many pathogens. Assays of chitin synthase isozymes and growth assays with isozyme mutants were used to demonstrate that nikkomycin Z is a selective inhibitor of chitin synthase 3. The resistance of chitin synthase 2 to nikkomycin Z in vitro is likely responsible for the poor activity of this antibiotic against Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
