In difluoromethylornithine resistant L1210 cells stimulated to growth from quiescence, the selective kappa-opioidergic agonist trans-(+/-)-3,4-dichloro-N-[2-(1-pyrrolidinyl)cyclohexyl]benzeneaceta mid e (U-50488H) caused a dose dependent inhibition of the induction of ODC activity, with a half-maximal effect at about 1 microM. U-50488H also provoked reduction of ODC mRNA level and increase of ODC turnover, as well as inhibition of cell growth. U-69593, another kappa-selective agonist, was only slightly effective. The action of U-50488H on ODC induction was not blocked by naloxone, beta-chlornaltrexamine or by the kappa-selective opioid antagonists Mr1452 and nor-binaltorphimine (nBNI). Actually Mr1452 and nBNI exerted some inhibitory effect. Furthermore, the separated enantiomers (+) and (-) of U-50488H were similarly effective. The (-)cis-(1S,2R)-U50488 stereoisomer, exhibiting low affinity for kappa and high affinity for sigma receptors and carbetapentane, another sigma ligand, also inhibited ODC induction, although less effectively than U-50488H. None of several other opioid ligands tested had significant effects on ODC induction. In conclusion, the inhibition of ODC expression by U-50488H does not involve classical, enantiospecific opioid receptors; rather, these results suggest the involvement of a distinct site of action linked to inhibition of lymphoid cell proliferation.
