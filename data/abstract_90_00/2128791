Human interferon (HuIFN) conferred human RSa cells to increased resistance to ultraviolet light, 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide and X-ray in association with enhancement of DNA-repair capacity. The HuIFN actions were summarized by the supervision of cellular response, possibly via plasminogen activator-like protease induction.
