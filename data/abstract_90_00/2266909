Using a recurrent technique, P. berghei isolate resistant to chloroquine-fansidar combination is formed in golden hamsters. The isolate resistant to chloroquine-fansidar combination was 4 times less sensitive to chloroquine, 2 times less sensitive to fansidar and its combinations, 2 times less sensitive to sulfadoxine, 31 times less sensitive to pyrimethamine, as compared to the baseline isolate LNK65 P. berghei characterized by naturally reduced sensitivity to chloroquine.
