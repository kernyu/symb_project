The incidence of pathogenic bacteria in respiratory tract infections in 1994 and 1995 was investigated using quantitative cultures of sputa from patients with the infections in our department. Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Moraxella catarrhalis were isolated at high rates (70.5% in 1994 and 73.8% in 1995) from the specimens of out-patients, and the incident rates were similar to the past data. The antimicrobial susceptibilities of these three pathogens were examined with the agar dilution method. The incidence of penicillin (Pc) resistant S. pneumoniae against which MIC of Pc-G was higher than 0.125 microgram/ml was markedly increased from 24% in 1994 to 34.9% in 1995. Most of the Pc resistant isolates were also resistant to other antibiotics including erythromycin, minocycline and tosufloxacin. Serotype of strains against which MIC of Pc-G was higher than 1.0 microgram/ml was 19. The ratios of beta-lactamase-producing strains among H. influenzae isolated in 1994 and 1995 were 20 and 15.8%, respectively, which were slightly higher than those in the past. One quinolone resistant strain was isolated in this study. Although the ratio of beta-lactamase-producing strains among M. catarrhalis was as high (96.7%) as in the past, no increased resistance against the drugs examined was observed.
