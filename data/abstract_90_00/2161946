MxA and MxB are interferon-induced proteins of human cells and are related to the murine protein Mx1, which confers selective resistance to influenza virus. In contrast to the nuclear murine protein Mx1, MxA and MxB are located in the cytoplasm, and their role in the interferon-induced antiviral state was unknown. In this report we show that transfected cell lines expressing MxA acquired a high degree of resistance to influenza A virus. Surprisingly, MxA also conferred resistance to vesicular stomatitis virus. Expression of MxA in transfected 3T3 cells had no effect on the multiplication of two picornaviruses, a togavirus, or herpes simplex virus type 1. Treatment of MxA-expressing cells with antibodies to mouse alpha-beta interferon did not abolish the resistance phenotype. The conclusion that resistance to influenza virus and vesicular stomatitis virus was due to the specific action of MxA is further supported by the observation that transfected 3T3 cell lines expressing the related MxB failed to acquire virus resistance.
