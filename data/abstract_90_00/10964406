Penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) catalyze the transpeptidase reaction involved in peptidoglycan synthesis and are covalently inhibited by the beta-lactam antibiotics. In a previous work we have focused on acylation efficiency measurements of various Streptococcus pneumoniae PBP2x* mutants to study the molecular determinants of resistance to beta-lactams. In the present paper we have developed a method to improve an accurate determination of the deacylation rate constant using electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry. This method is adaptable to the analysis of deacylation of any beta-lactam. Compared to the fluorographic technique, the ESI-MS method is insensitive to variations in the concentration of functional proteins and is therefore more reliable. We have established that the resistance of PBPs to beta-lactams is mostly due to a decrease of the acylation efficiency with only marginal effects on the deacylation rates.
