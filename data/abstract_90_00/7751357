Recent analysis of the gene encoding the beta subunit of Mycobacterium tuberculosis RNA polymerase (rpoB) has demonstrated a small region that harbors the mutations most frequently associated with rifampin resistance. Earlier reports have described a high degree of sequence conservation of rpoB among mycobacteria other than M. tuberculosis and other GC-rich bacteria that can lead to false-positive amplification when applied directly to clinical specimens. We developed reagents for PCR amplification that are based on signature nucleotides discovered by comparative sequence analysis of the rpoB genes of organisms phylogenetically related to M. tuberculosis. The specificities of the reagents were challenged with 20 isolates of multiple-drug-resistant M. tuberculosis and more than 20 species of mycobacteria other than M. tuberculosis and other GC-rich organisms. A single-tube heminested PCR protocol was devised to obtain sensitivity equal to those of an IS6110-based PCR assay and culture in spiked sputum experiments. The assay correctly identified 21 of 24 (87.5%) culture-positive specimens, 13 of which were acid-fast smear-negative, in a panel of 51 clinical specimens. Three specimens that were false-positive initially were negative upon repeat testing when the assay was modified to eliminate the potential for aerosol carryover of the first-round amplification product during the open-tube addition of the second set of reaction reagents. This assay is the most sensitive and specific test to date for the direct detection of M. tuberculosis rpoB in clinical specimens. This rapid PCR-based assay can be used for the simultaneous identification of M. tuberculosis and its rifampin susceptibility genotype.
