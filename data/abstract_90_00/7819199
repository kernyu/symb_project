We demonstrate in a quantitative in vitro induction assay that tetracycline-Fe2+ is a more than 1000-fold stronger inducer of Tet repressor compared to tetracycline-Mg2+. Oxidative cleavage of the Tet repressor-tetracycline-Fe2+ complex with H2O2 and ascorbate results in an Fe(2+)-dependent specific fragmentation of the protein. The maximal yield of about 15% and a reaction time of less than 30 s are only observed in the presence of the drug, whereas about 1% cleavage is obtained after 30 min in the presence of Fe2+ without tetracycline. Cleavage is not inhibited by several radical scavengers, suggesting a highly localized reactivity of the redox-active oxo intermediates in the proximity of the Fe(2+)-tc chelater where they are generated. The products can be separated by HPLC only after denaturation, indicating that the complex is not disrupted by cleavage. Residues at which the cleavage takes place are identified using the masses of the fragments determined by electrospray mass spectrometry and their N-terminal sequences. The major cleavage site maps to residues 104 and 105 of Tet repressor. Less efficient cleavages occur at residues 56 and 136, and the least efficiently cleaved sites are around residues 144 and 147. The cleavage efficiencies correlate to the distances and orientations of the respective peptide bonds to Mg2+ in the crystal structure of the Tet repressor-tetracycline-Mg2+ complex. We discuss potential reaction mechanisms leading to protein cleavage.
