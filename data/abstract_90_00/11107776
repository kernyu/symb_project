Serratia spp. has been identified as an important opportunistic pathogen agent in nosocomial infections. The aim of the study was the determination of extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) occurrence among 78 of Serratia spp. strains isolated in 1996-1998 from clinical specimens obtained from patients of State Clinical Hospital in Bydgoszcz. Identification of Serratia spp. strains was performed in automatic ATB system with ID 32GN strips (bioMerieux). The strains with ESBL activity were detected by double-disc method according to Jarlier et al. (10) with small modifications. Clavulanic acid, tazobactam and sulbactam were used as the inhibitors of ESBLs. Drug-susceptibility was determined by disc-diffusion method according to NCCLS standards. Forty-five (57.7%) of the strains were ESBL (+). All of them belonged to S. marcescens species. The majority--91.1% of strains was derived from urine, 3 from wound and 1 from blood. The obtained results indicate the necessity of monitoring of ESBL-producing strains among gram-negative rods from clinical specimen. The aims of such a procedure are to control and to prevent their dissemination within hospital, as well as to avoid therapeutic failures.
