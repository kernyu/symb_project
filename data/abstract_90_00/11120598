We have observed differential immune responses in mice with different circling preferences, which are posited to reflect interindividual immune response differences influenced by brain laterality effects on neuroimmune circuits. In this study, we have investigated the influence of inorganic lead (Pb) and/or Listeria monocytogenes (LM) infection on the cytokine and corticosterone (CORT) levels of mice grouped by lateralized behavior. Pb increased the LM susceptibility of mice with both left (LC)- and right-circling (RC) preferences; however, Pb did not inhibit the host resistance of mice with no circling preference (NP mice). The basal serum IFNgamma levels were lowered in all groups after Pb exposure, which coincided with a decrease in host resistance in LC and RC mice, but not NP mice. Pb also altered the basal serum CORT levels, and these changes appear to correlate better with changes in the host resistance of all groups. The basal CORT levels were significantly lowered by Pb in mice with a circling preference, and Pb significantly suppressed the host resistance of mice with a circling preference. However, Pb slightly increased the serum CORT level of NP mice, and their host resistance was slightly improved by Pb. After infection, the increase in CORT levels was associated with an increase in the serum IL-6 levels, which may reflect cytokine influences on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. At 3 days after infection, the serum IL-6 level seems to be a good indicator of the severity of the infection. We suggest that environmental stressors can reorder the observed differential susceptibility to LM in mice with different circling preferences, in that relatively resistant mice (RC mice) become more susceptible than NP mice after exposure to Pb. The results suggest that environmental stressors may have differential effects among individuals with endogenous differences in their neuroimmune circuits, since brain laterality is known to influence immune functions.
