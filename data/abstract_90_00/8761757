PURPOSE: To study the susceptibility to fluconazole of Candida albicans strains in oral candidiasis of HIV positive patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eleven HIV positive patients with confirmed oral candidiasis were included in a 4 to 10 months prospective study. In addition, 23 HIV positive patients were evaluated in a restrospective study (14 with oral candidiasis and 9 control subjects). The MICs to fluconazole of C. albicans were characterized by genotyping (electrophoretic karyotype). RESULTS: Thirty patients were evaluable. Oral candidiasis was found in 21 patients; 7/21 patients (33,3 p. 100) developed resistant C. albicans strain (MIC > 32 mg/ml) after a mean fluconazole cumulative dose of 18 g. In this study, the electrophoretic karyotype confirmed the persistence of the same C. albicans strain in each patient. In addition increased colonization by C. krusei or C. glabrata was found in 6/21 patients (28.5 p. 100). DISCUSSION: Our data demonstrate that prolonged treatment with fluconazole dose higher than 13 g induces the emergence of resistant C. albicans with persistence of the same C. albicans strain. Fluconazole has to be reserved to oral candidiasis after failure of a local treatment or to severe cases.
