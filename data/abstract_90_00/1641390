Islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) has been recently identified as the principal constituent of amyloid deposits in pancreatic islets of patients with type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus and causes insulin resistance in some target cells. In addition, glucose-induced insulin secretion is inhibited by IAPP. We studied the effect of IAPP on proinsulin biosynthesis in rat insulinoma (RINr) cells. Glucose at concentrations of 0, 15, 30, 60, 100, and 300 mg/dl stimulated proinsulin biosynthesis in a dose-responsive and and actino-mycin D-inhibitable manner after 6 h of incubation. At a glucose concentration of 300 mg/dl, IAPP decreased the mean responses of proinsulin biosynthesis to 61.2 and 29% at concentrations of 0.1 and 1 microM, respectively, compared with the IAPP-free control. In conclusion, IAPP inhibits glucose-induced proinsulin biosynthesis in RINr cells. IAPP might play an important role in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus.
