The antibiotic sensitivity of 19 Gram-positive bacterial strains (11 Staphylococcus aureus and 8 Staphylococcus epidermidis) and 16 Gram-negative strains (8 Escherichia coli and 8 Proteus species) was evaluated after contact with stainless steel and with some metals compounding the alloys used for prosthetic devices. The hypothesis was that the resistance to antibiotic therapy of infections associated with prosthetic implants is also due to a modification in the sensitivity of microorganisms. The results, compared to those obtained from control tests, showed only slight variations in the antibiotic sensitivity of the strains put in contact with the metals. In Gram-positive strains, after contact with metals, the increase in sensitivity occurred more frequently than the reduction. In Gram-negative strains, the decrease in sensitivity was more frequent than the increase. Proteus strains showed sensitivity variations more frequently than Escherichia coli strains. Titanium and nickel induced the highest number of variations, both in Gram-positive and Gram-negative strains.
