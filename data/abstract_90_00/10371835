The local antibiotics are an important addition to the treatment of moderately severe skin infections. Development of contact allergy and bacterial resistance, however, are some of the adverse reactions that may occur. Fusidic acid and tetracycline are the most suitable products for the treatment of superficial primary infections of the skin caused by Gram-positive cocci and secondary infected dermatoses. In case of insufficient effect mupirocin may be tried. Mupirocin is an effective antibiotic in the treatment of nasal carriage of Staphylococcus aureus in cases of increased risk of infection (haemodialysis, continuous peritoneal dialysis, after thoracic surgery). Besides it is an important local antibiotic in the treatment of meticillin-resistant staphylococci in the nose. In order to prevent development of bacterial resistance its further use has to be restricted. Silver sulfadiazine is a good option for the local treatment of infections by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other Gram-negative bacteria. Erythromycin and clindamycin are useful local antibiotics for the treatment of mild acne vulgaris. Disinfectants are mainly suitable for the use on the intact skin.
