Vancomycin resistance among enterococci has recently been recognized. Synergy between vancomycin and penicillin has been shown in vitro for isolates of Enterococcus faecium resistant to both of these antibiotics. We describe three isolates of vancomycin-resistant E. faecium which demonstrate unique phenotypic characteristics. The isolates exhibited high-level resistance to both vancomycin and teicoplanin, consistent with the VanA phenotype. However, resistance in these isolates could not be induced or cured, and mating experiments failed to detect a transfer of resistance. The combination of vancomycin and penicillin did not significantly change the MIC of penicillin for any of the three isolates. Immunoblotting with polyclonal anti-VanB antibody showed no reaction with the cellular proteins of these strains. Probing with a vanA oligonucleotide revealed hybridization with chromosomal but not plasmid DNA. The mechanism of constitutive resistance of those strains remains unclear. A second mutational change, perhaps involving PBP 5, may explain the presence of resistance to synergistic combination penicillin-vancomycin therapy. In vitro evaluation of penicillin-vancomycin should be carried out in all clinical cases where this therapeutic regimen is being considered.
