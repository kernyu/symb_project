The in vitro susceptibility of 55 strains of Neisseria meningitidis isolated in 1993 and 1994 at the Valme and Macarena Hospitals, Sevilla, Spain to penicillin, ampicillin, cefotaxime, cefpodoxime, imipenem, rifampin, ciprofloxacin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, erythromycin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole were determined by a microdilution method in Mueller-Hinton broth. Among our N. meningitidis isolates, 36.4% were found to be moderately resistant to penicillin, 43.6% were resistant to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. All the strains were susceptible to tetracycline, ciprofloxacin, cefotaxime and rifampin.
