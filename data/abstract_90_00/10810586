A study was conducted to examine the incidence of ciprofloxacin resistance in the strains of bacteria isolated from patients with suspected urinary tract infection (UTI) and to analyse the level of resistance. A total of 63 bacterial isolates were grown from quantitative urine culture and were in significant count. Antibiotic susceptibility tests were done by using disc diffusion method of Kirby-Bauer and the level of resistance was analyzed by break point minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). Majority of bacteria isolated and tested were Gram negative with Escherichia coli as the commonest isolate. Antibiotic susceptibility testing revealed a high prevalence of resistance to nalidixic acid, ampicillin and norfloxacin.
