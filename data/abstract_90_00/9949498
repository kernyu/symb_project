The study revealed the existence of differences between various representatives of the genus Neisseria gonorrhoeae, as well as intraspecific variations of N.gonorrhoeae by the spectrum of biological characteristics, including antilusozyme and anticomplement activity and resistance to the bactericidal action of blood serum and to the preparation of human leukocyte interferon. In contrast to other Neisseria species, all N.gonorrhoeae were characterized by a high level of anticomplement activity and resistance to the host's bactericidal systems, while a high level of antilysozyme activity, significantly exceeding that of gonococci, was found to be characteristics of other species of the genus Neisseriaceae. Within the species N.gonorrhoeae, the properties under study were associated into a single factor, closely correlated to the duration of the infectious process, which served as the basis for the development of a mathematical algorithm for the identification of persisting gonococcal strains.
