Susceptibility to antibiotics of 39 Campylobacter jejuni/coli strains was appreciated using the modified disc method (sowing by loop). Eighteen strains were examined in duplicate using the conventional disc susceptibility method (sowing by inundation). Based on the diameters (mm) of growth inhibition zones and on the respective critical concentrations (mcg/ml) the MICs were also appreciated. All the strains were resistant to rifampicin, polymyxin M sulphate, ketokonazole, cephalotin, cephazolin; most of the strains were resistant to carbenicillin, one third to ampicillin and almost one fifth to polymyxin E. These findings enable us to recommend these antibiotics (excepted penicillins) as ingredients for the selective media for Campylobacter isolation. All the strains were sensible to ciprofloxacine and chloramphenicol; most of the strains were sensible to doxicicline, to tetracycline and to Nalidixic acid. Three strains were appreciated as intermediate sensible to cephotaxime, two strains to erythromycin and one strain to clindamycin. These antimicrobial agents were recommended in the treatment of the campylobacterioses according to the susceptibility testing results of each isolated strain. All strains were also sensible to gentamycin, kanamycin, streptomycin and tobramycin. Although the results of both technical variants were comparable the conventional disc method was more precise and seems to be better for MICs appreciation. The MICs (90%) of ampicillin, cephotaxime, erythromycin, colistin and metronidazole exceeded slightly the respective standard data. The MICs for the rest of the antibiotics were lower than the accepted international concentrations.
