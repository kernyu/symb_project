Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) is induced in neoplastic cell lines by interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) treatment. In ME180 cervical carcinoma cells, there is a rapid increase in IDO mRNA accumulation beginning at 4 h after IFN-gamma treatment and continuing for at least 24 h. The IFN-gamma-resistant mutant of ME180, IR3B6B, expresses very low levels of IDO message after IFN-gamma treatment. However, pretreatment of this mutant with poly(I:C) restores normal levels of IDO mRNAs and IDO enzyme activity. Poly(I:C) mediated reversal of the IFN-gamma-resistant phenotype and induction of IDO mRNA are inhibited by 2-aminopurine. In vitro phosphorylation of calf thymus histone using the immunoprecipitated p68 kinase prepared from IFN-gamma-treated ME180 and IR3B6B cells revealed the deficiency of activation of this kinase in IR3B6B cells after IFN-gamma treatment, and treatment of this mutant cells with poly(I:C) restores p68 kinase activity. From these results, we conclude that a double-stranded RNA-dependent kinase is activated by IFN-gamma treatment and its activation correlates with IFN-gamma-mediated induction of the IDO gene.
