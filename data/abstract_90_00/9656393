Plasmodium falciparum in Southeast Asia is highly resistant to chloroquine, sulfadoxine/ pyrimethamine, quinine and even mefloquine. The use of two doses of short course artemether/mefloquine combination has been shown to be effective in a recent study. In the present study, we have assessed the efficacy of short course treatment with artesunate/mefloquine, in comparison with artemether/mefloquine in patients with multidrug resistant falciparum malaria. Ninety-nine Thai male patients who sought consultation at Makham Malaria Clinic, Chantaburi (eastern part of Thailand), were randomized to receive either the combination of artemether (150 and 100 mg; group A) or artesunate (150 and 100 mg; group B) with mefloquine (750 and 500 mg) at 24 hours apart. The follow-up was on days 1, 2, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35 and 42. Patients in both groups showed a rapid initial response to treatment; fever and parasite were cleared within 48 hours in 100 and 100% vs 91.8 and 96%, for group A vs B, respectively. All patients in group A had completed the 42 day-follow up; however, two patients in group B did not finish the 42-day follow-up. The cure rate was 100% in either group. No serious adverse effects were found. Artemether or artesunate with mefloquine given two doses at 24 hours apart can be used as effective alternative treatment regimens for multidrug resistant falciparum malaria.
