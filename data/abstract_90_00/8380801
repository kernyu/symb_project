A class II Tn3-type transposable element, designated Tn5393 and located on plasmid pEa34 from streptomycin-resistant strain CA11 of Erwinia amylovora, was identified by its ability to move from pEa34 to different sites in plasmids pGEM3Zf(+) and pUCD800. Nucleotide sequence analysis reveals that Tn5393 consists of 6,705 bp with 81-bp terminal inverted repeats and generates 5-bp duplications of the target DNA following insertion. Tn5393 contains open reading frames that encode a putative transposase (tnpA) and resolvase (tnpR) of 961 and 181 amino acids, respectively. The two open reading frames are separated by a putative recombination site (res) consisting of 194 bp. Two streptomycin resistance genes, strA and strB, were identified on the basis of their DNA sequence homology to streptomycin resistance genes in plasmid RSF1010. StrA is separated from tnpR by a 1.2-kb insertion element designated IS1133. The tnpA-res-tnpR region of Tn5393 was detected in Pseudomonas syringae pv. papulans Psp36 and in many other gram-negative bacteria harboring strA and strB. Except for some strains of Erwinia herbicola, these other gram-negative bacteria lacked insertion sequence IS1133. The prevalence of strA and strB could be accounted for by transposition of Tn5393 to conjugative plasmids that are then disseminated widely among gram-negative bacteria.
