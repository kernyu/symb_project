Preliminary screening of antiviral AIDS drugs has been carried out using three different in vitro assay systems. Among 246 samples of different origin tested, six were shown to inhibit the growth of HIV in vitro. Two of the positive samples have hopeful signs, as the ranges of effective doses are wider than those of most of positive samples which had been found by us.
