Helminthic infection can stimulate the interleukin-4 (IL-4)-dependent polyclonal synthesis of immunoglobulin E (IgE) in children endemically exposed to these parasites. As such children are also frequently at nutritional risk, in this study we considered the possible influence of malnutrition on serum IL-4 levels and the IgE response in helminthic infection. We evaluated 85 Ascaris-infected children living in an urban slum area of Caracas, Venezuela, and found that the serum levels of IL-4 and total IgE were significantly higher in malnourished children than in their well nourished counterparts. In contrast, the specific anti-Ascaris IgE antibody response was significantly lower in the malnourished group. After anthelmintic treatment of the children, the total serum IgE and IL-4 levels decreased significantly in the well nourished group, while the specific anti-Ascaris IgE antibody response increased. No significant change was detected, however, in the malnourished group. Our results suggested that malnutrition potentiates the polyclonal stimulation of IgE synthesis induced by helminths. As specific IgE antibody has been implicated in the resistance to helminthic infection, and the polyclonal stimulus diminishes this response, these factors may increase the susceptibility of malnourished children to such parasites.
