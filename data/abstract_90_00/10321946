BACKGROUND: Some studies have addressed the epidemiology of scabies among rural populations in developing countries; however, the epidemiology of scabies among the rural population in Egypt is unknown. We sought to determine the magnitude of scabies infestation in an Egyptian village and to evaluate the control measures after 1 year. METHODS: This study was carried out on 3147 residents of Mit-Moaned village in Dakahlia govemorate, Egypt. It was a cross-sectional follow-up study where the same individuals examined in round I were re-examined in round III. The two rounds were separated by a period of 1 year, during which infested patients were followed up and new cases were discovered (round II). Patients and their household contacts received treatment with topical permethrin. Patients showing resistance to permethrin received a single oral dose of ivermectin. RESULTS: In round III, the overall prevalence rate of scabies was reduced from 5.4% in round I to 1.1%. The incidence of new cases among susceptible persons during round II was 1.1%. Scabies was significantly (P < 0.05) more prevalent among families of large size, high crowding index at night, low socioeconomic standards, and those receiving their water supply from a hand pump. Children younger than 10 years showed the highest prevalence. CONCLUSIONS: Our data provide the first complete picture of the epidemiology of scabies in rural Egypt. The epidemiologic characteristics of the disease should be considered in the design of disease control programs for other villages with scabies epidemics. Our findings revealed that good control was achieved with the following: increased awareness and better case finding, education of the staff at the rural health unit, improved hygiene measures, and massive treatment campaigns using effective drugs such as topical permethrin and oral ivermectin.
