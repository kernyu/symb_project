Human neutrophil aggregation induced by Escherichia coli K12 cells has been studied. D-mannose has been found to inhibit the process in the dose-dependent way causing the full blockage at 10 mM concentration. The process of disaggregation induced by the concentration is significantly higher at 10 degrees C than at 37 degrees C. The inhibitors of cellular oxygenation such as N-ethylmaleimide, nordihydroguaiaretic acid, trifluoperazine, and colchicine did not affect the aggregation process. Cellular aggregation was concomitant with production of H2O2, and this reaction was also blocked by D-mannose and depended on the number of bacteria present. The nordihydroguaiaretic acid and N-ethylmaleimide inhibited production of H2O2, while sodium azide enhanced the process. The results show the mannose-specific contact of bacteria and neutrophils to depend on the functional activity of phagocytes including their ability to produce H2O2.
