The substitution of methionine by either isoleucine or valine at residue 460 in the UL97 phosphotransferase has been shown to be responsible for resistance to ganciclovir (GCV) in 30% of resistant cytomegalovirus (CMV) isolates [4]. These substitutions require one nucleotide change in the gene (G- > T 1 380 and A- > G 1378 respectively). The aim of this study was to develop a discriminative PCR assay for rapid detection of these DNA changes. A PCR assay was duplicated in parallel for each mutation; to detect G- > T 1380 each reaction mixture contained primer VSUL14 and either primer LNW to distinguish wild type residues or LNM to distinguish mutant residues, and for A- > G 1378 primers were VSUL8 and either MCMW to detect wild type sequences or MCMM to detect mutated residues. For optimal discrimination, primers MCMW and MCMM were designed with a mismatch at position 3'-1. The reference strains AD169, Davis and Towne, a laboratory GCV-resistant mutant RCL1.7, and 33 CMV isolates (10 resistant, 2 indetermined and 21 sensitive) were tested by PCR. AD169, Davis and Towne, and 30 isolates were amplified only with non modified primers, and the absence of 460 mutations was confirmed by sequencing. Two isolates P1 and P2, from a transplanted patient were amplified with both MCMM and MCMW: sequencing analysis shown the presence of a mixture of strain, one of them harbouring A- > G 1378 mutation. One resistant strain was amplified neither with MCMM nor with MCMW: a C- > T silent mutation at nt 1368 was present. As sequencing analysis confirmed PCR results, discriminative PCR enables isolates to be rapidly assessed for the presence or absence of 460 mutations. Moreover, it can distinguish Met to Val from Met to Ile mutations, and allows the analysis of mixtures of sensitive ad resistant strains.
