In a field study of 29 dairy farms, Pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated more frequently (P = 0.05) from milking parlor udder wash water systems containing iodophor germicides than from those with no germicide. Most available iodine (AI2) concentrations were below the recommended level of 25 ppm (25 microgram/ml). Rubber and polyvinyl chloride hoses caused rapid decreases in the AI2 concentrations of 25 ppm iodophor solutions. AI2 dropped from 25 ppm to 6 ppm or less in 240 min for solutions contained in either polyvinyl chloride or rubber, compared with solutions in glass, which were unchanged in 240 min. Addition of inactivated iodophor solution to aqueous cultures resulted in significantly higher (P less than 0.05) numbers of P. aeruginosa at 10 and 24 h postinoculation. P. aeruginosa was grown in polyvinyl chloride tubing and exposed twice daily to 0, 10, or 25 ppm of AI2. None of the exposure concentrations eliminated the bacteria from the hoses, and bacterial numbers were not significantly different in hoses exposed to 0 and 10 ppm by the eighth treatment day. Bacteria taken from the water in these hoses were exposed to different concentrations of iodophor solution. Iodophor concentrations which will kill 50% of P. aeruginosa cultures previously exposed to 0, 10, and 25 ppm of AI2 were predicted to be 3.0, 11.8, and 20.8 ppm, respectively.
