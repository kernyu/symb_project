The ability of six screening methods to detect high-level aminoglycoside resistance in enterococcal species other than Enterococcus faecalis was investigated. The 85 Enterococcus isolates, which included 55 E. faecium, 11 E. gallinarum, 9 E. casseliflavus, 5 E. raffinosus, 4 E. avium, and 1 E. mundtii, were tested by using aminoglycoside-supplemented brain heart infusion agar (BHI), Remel EF Synergy Quad plates, high-content aminoglycoside diffusion disks, standard (prepared in-house) microdilution panels, Pasco MIC Gram Positive microdilution panels, and Vitek GPS-TA cards. When tested on BHI, 32 and 35 strains showed resistance to gentamicin and streptomycin, respectively. Resistance profiles obtained with Remel EF Synergy Quad plates were in complete agreement with those obtained on BHI. However, growth on Mueller-Hinton agar-based plates was not as heavy. Some isolates showed only weak growth and required 48 h for resistance to become evident, especially with swab inoculation of quadrants containing 2,000 micrograms of gentamicin per ml. Profiles obtained by use of the agar-based screens were used as the basis for evaluating the other methods. Disk diffusion showed complete agreement. No false resistance occurred by either microdilution method, but 48 h of incubation was needed for detection of some gentamicin-resistant isolates, and 14% of the streptomycin-resistant strains were not detected by standard microdilution. The Vitek GPS-TA card detected 81 and 100% of the gentamicin- and streptomycin-resistant isolates, respectively. In general, most methods used to detect high-level aminoglycoside resistance in E. faecalis appear to be reliable for the testing of the other enterococcal species. However, further investigations with a greater number of resistant E. raffinosus, E. avium, and E. mundtii isolates, when they are available, will be useful for establishing the full range of enterococci that can reliably be tested by the various methods.
