A concerted malaria eradication programme in the United Arab Emirates has reduced local transmission to only a very few small foci in the country. The Al Ain district is now a consolidation zone. However, transmission across the undemarcated border with Oman continues. Malaria imported by the large immigrant work force from major disease endemic areas remains a large burden. An added threat is the appearance of chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium falciparum principally from Sudan and Pakistan but increasingly amongst Omani cases seen in the hospitals and clinics in Al Ain. The implications of re-introduction of malaria and the establishment of chloroquine resistance, particularly for non-immune residents and visitors, are emphasized.
