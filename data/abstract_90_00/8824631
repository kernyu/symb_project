A study examining the influence of TolC on AcrA, AcrR, and MarR1 mutants indicates that functional TolC is required for the operation of the AcrAB efflux system and for the expression of the Mar phenotype. That the effect of TolC on the AcrAB pump is not regulatory in nature is shown by studies measuring the influence of a tolC::Tn10 insertion mutation on the expression of an acrA::lacZ reporter fusion. These results are compatible with the hypothesis that TolC is a component of the AcrAB efflux complex.
