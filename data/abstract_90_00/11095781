Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus species represent serious gram-positive pathogens for which there is currently no recommended therapy. There are a number of new antibiotics with activity against these pathogens in development. Although there is a great deal of experience with some of these agents for skin and soft tissue infections, bacteremia, pneumonia, and intra-abdominal infections, there is currently little information available for the treatment of endocarditis. Animal and limited human data thus far suggest that new agents such as quinuprisitin-dalfopristin, LY333328 (a new glycopeptide antibiotic), and daptomycin (a lipopeptide antibiotic) may prove useful for this indication. Additional information, and especially combination treatment, are warranted to improve success and limit the emergence of resistance to these new antibiotics.
