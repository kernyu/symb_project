The authors suggest a combined method for the treatment of new torpid and chronic gonorrheal urethritis, involving preliminary studies of the agent's cellular respiration activity, and offer the technique for predicting the efficacy of such treatment. If gonococcal cellular respiration activity is low, aerobic processes in these agents are stimulated with daily subcutaneous injections of plasmol (a biostimulant), starting from 1 ml and building up the dose by 1 ml daily, and local irrigations of the urethra with oxygen cocktails via specially designed irrigators (Authors' Certificate No. 827071 USSR); such stimulation is carried out for 4 days prior to specific therapy. This treatment modality is maintained by an Authors Certificate No. 1107867 USSR. To check up the efficacy of the antibiotic chosen for therapy, a rapid method has been developed, consisting in measurement of the patient's blood serum antibacterial activity carried out in special chambers for cell microcultivation.
