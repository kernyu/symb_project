The pre-shock incubation of cells plus DNA and the methylation state of plasmid DNA were found to play a role in the electroporation-based transformation of Clostridium perfringens 3626B. Following pre-shock incubation, the highest number of C. perfringens 3626B transformants was obtained when plasmid pGK201 was both dam+ dcm+ modified, while no transformants were obtained when pGK201 was not methylated or only dcm methylated. This is consistent with the observation that plasmid pGK201 was protected against digestion by C. perfringens 3626B cell-associated nucleases for up to 3 min when methylated by both methylases. C. perfringens 3626B was successfully transformed only within a narrow cell recovery rate window. The ermAM gene associated with pGK201 and pAK102 was found to integrate into the chromosome of C. perfringens strain 13A and 3626B.
