This investigation was to determine whether Pseudomonas aeruginosa could acquire resistance to the bactericide isothiazolone, and what the nature of such a resistance mechanism would be. The Pseudomonas was cultured in nutrient-limited broth in the presence of sub-inhibitory concentrations of isothiazolone (a mixture of 1.15% 5-chloro-N-methylisothiazolone (CMIT) and 0.35% N-methylisothiazolone (MIT)). Three cultures tested in parallel adapted gradually during exposure for 15 d from an initial minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 300 microliters l-1 to 607 microliters l-1. The three parallel cultures adapted at similar rates, so the adaptation was not ascribed to mutation but to a specific mechanism. Resistant cells did not produce any extracellular isothiazolone-quenching compounds nor undergo detectable alterations in their lipopolysaccharide layer. In wild cells, a 35 kDa outer membrane protein (protein T) was detectable, whereas resistant cells lacked this protein. Production of protein T was suppressed within 24 h of exposure to isothiazolone. It was still suppressed after 72 h of growth in isothiazolone-free medium. It is proposed that Ps. aeruginosa acquires resistance to isothiazolone by a process of adaptation where the outer membrane protein T is suppressed.
