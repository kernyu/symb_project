The efficacy of partial pneumonectomies in 700 patients with newly-diagnosed destructive tuberculosis preceded by an ineffective antibacterial therapy for 3-15 months was studied. Operations were performed in 411 (58.8%) patients with fibrocavernous tuberculosis, in 173 (24.7%) with cavernous tuberculosis, in 10 (1.4%) with disseminated tuberculosis and cavitation, and in 106 (15.1%) with tuberculoma. Segmental resections were carried out in 214 (30.6%) cases, lobectomies in 309 (44.1%), and combined resections in 177 (25.3%). Immediately good and satisfactory clinical efficacy was achieved in 687 (98.1%) and 7 (1.0%) subjects respectively, the remaining 6 (0.9%) patients died. 3-15 years after the operation, the reactivation of tuberculosis was observed in 14 (2.3%) cases out of the 603 examined. An intensive antibacterial therapy as well as repeated operations made it possible to cure 6 patients, with 5 still under treatment and 3 dead. Later on a stable clinical cure was registered in 595 (98.7%) patients out of the 603 examined.
