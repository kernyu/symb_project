Eighteen methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) samples isolated from patients and the environment in an intensive care unit (ICU) during a routine surveillance were tested for antimicrobial resistance and typed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. Three pulsed-field patterns were observed. Sixteen were ciprofloxacin resistant and had identical pulsed-field patterns. The results suggested that a ciprofloxacin-resistant MRSA clone had contaminated the environment and spread among patients. This study demonstrates the application of infection control surveillance combined with strain typing in detecting MRSA colonization in the ICU where it was not known to exist.
