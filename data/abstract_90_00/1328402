Protease inhibitor Ro 31-8959, a compound that interrupts human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-specific formation of infectious virions, was evaluated in two-drug combined regimens with zidovudine, 2',3'-dideoxycytidine (ddC), or recombinant interferon-alpha A (rIFN-alpha A) against HIV-1 replication in vitro. By using peripheral blood mononuclear cells infected with HIV-1, drug interactions were evaluated by the median-effect principle and the isobologram technique. A zidovudine-sensitive and -resistant HIV-1 isolate pair was studied. Additive to synergistic anti-HIV-1 interactions were seen with 7.5-30 nM Ro 31-8959 and 0.005-0.02 microM zidovudine (for the zidovudine-sensitive HIV-1 isolate), 0.25-1.0 microM zidovudine (for the zidovudine-resistant HIV-1 isolate), 0.025-0.1 microM ddC, and 8-32 units/mL rIFN-alpha A, without additive toxicity. Phase I/II clinical trials of Ro 31-8959 for therapy of HIV-1 infection are in progress. If results are favorable, combined regimens including Ro 31-8959 deserve consideration for future clinical trials.
