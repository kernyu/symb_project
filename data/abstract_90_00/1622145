This paper shows that the response to tamoxifen (T) can be improved and the resistance to the antiestrogen can be overcome, in advanced breast cancer, by a pretreatment with natural beta-interferon (nIFN-beta) followed by the association of nIFN-beta with T. Forty-three patients with advanced breast cancer, both progressive (group A) and stable or partially responsive (group B) to previous treatment with T received nIFN-beta i.m. 3 x 10(6) IU/day for 14 days and, subsequently, T30 mg/day and nIFN-beta once a week. The overall objective response rate was 26% (95% Confidence Interval = 13-39) with 8 PR obtained in group A and 3 CR in group B. The median duration of response was 6 months (range 3-12+). Stabilization of disease was observed in 44% of cases. Toxicity was mild.
