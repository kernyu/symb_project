A plasmid-borne transposon encodes enzymes and regulator proteins that confer resistance of enterococcal bacteria to the antibiotic vancomycin. Purification and characterization of individual proteins encoded by this operon has helped to elucidate the molecular basis of vancomycin resistance. This new understanding provides opportunities for intervention to reverse resistance.
