Three antimalarial treatment regimens by the complete standard WHO tests were examined in 105 Plasmodium falciparum-infected patients who were nonimmune newcomers treated at the Russian hospital in Luanda in 1991-1992, 61% showed chloroquine resistance and 40% fansidar resistance. All 59 patients with high rates of parasitemia were successfully cured with quinine in combination with tetracycline. Thick, if required thin, blood smears were microscopically examined. The findings suggest that Fansidar should be a drug of first-line therapy in Angola, though in the neighbouring countries quinine continues preserving its efficacy, but there is a delayed elimination of the parasites within 7 days of initiation of the therapy, making it necessary to prolong therapy with this drug up to 10 days.
