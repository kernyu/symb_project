The aim of this study was to ascertain the activity of a selection of widely-used antiseptic/disinfectant agents against antibiotic resistant bacteria and strains isolated from patients infected with clinically significant species. Four antiseptic agents (Dettol, Dettol Hospital Concentrate, Savlon and Betadine) were tested against Staphylococcus aureus, Methicillin Resistant S. aureus (MRSA), Enterococcus hirae, Vancomicin Resistant Enterococcus sp (VRE), Escherichia coli and E. coli 0157. The antiseptics were applied at recommended use dilutions and at a half and a quarter of those concentrations in a standard suspension test (EST). Organic material was added to mimic the presence of blood, protein and other such contaminants to be found in the clinical situation. All antiseptics tested were effective against both the antibiotic sensitive and antibiotic resistant strains of S. aureus and E. hirae as well as normal and clinical strains of E. coli at recommended concentrations. All but Betadine were also effective against the antibiotic resistant bacteria at a half and a quarter of normal concentration. The iodine containing antiseptic, however, failed the test against MRSA at a half normal concentration and showed virtually no activity against MRSA at a quarter normal concentration.
