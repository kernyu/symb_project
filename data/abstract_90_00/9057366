During January, 1994 to December, 1994, 703 of the 1778 blood specimen were positive for blood culture and 59.9% of the isolates were of staphylococci. Thirty two percent of the staphylococci were methicillin resistant. Netilmycin showed the lowest in vitro resistance among Gram positive cocci & Klebsiella species. Netilmycin, amikacin, ciprafloxacin and the third generation cephalosporins in general showed greater in vitro sensitivity among gram negative bacilli. The netilmycin had the lowest incidence of drug resistance based on the pooled data over the blood culture.
