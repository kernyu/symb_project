Enterococcus faecium has recently emerged as a serious nosocomial pathogen. Vancomycin resistant enterococci (VRE) have been isolated in Europe and the USA since 1988. This is the first report on isolation of vancomycin resistant E. faecium (VREM) strains in Poland, from Haematological Unit patients in the Clinical Hospital in Gdansk. In total, 6412 samples were examined between December 1996 and October 1997. Five hundred and five isolates of Enterococcus spp. were collected. One hundred and one were classified as Enterococcus faecium of which 49 were resistant to vancomycin (MIC > 256 mg/L) and teicoplanin (MIC > 256 mg/L), characteristic of the VanA phenotype. Twenty-nine patients were infected or colonized. A PCR-based specific diagnostic assay confirmed the phenotype. The multiplex PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism patterns were consistent with VanA-type of vancomycin-resistant E. faecium for all isolates examined. These isolates were epidemiologically-related as shown by PCR-fingerprinting.
