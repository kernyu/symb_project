Sows and pigs from 10 commercial swine farms were sampled to determine patterns of resistance of fecal Escherichia coli to five commonly used antibiotics. Before testing, farms were categorized as high or low antibiotic use based on interviews with the respective producers. On each farm, fecal swabs were obtained from five sows at 7 d postpartum and from five pigs from each sow at 7, 35, and 63 d of age. A total of 6,296 E. coli isolates from 750 pig fecal samples and a total of 462 E. coli isolates from 50 sow fecal samples were tested against apramycin, carbadox, gentamicin, neomycin, and oxytetracycline using a standardized disk diffusion test. Percentage of resistant organisms was compared between pigs at the various stages of growth, between sows and their respective pigs, and between farms of high and low antibiotic use. Incidence of resistance was greater (P < .05) in pigs at 35 or 63 d of age compared with 7 d of age for most antibiotics, and patterns differed between high-use and low-use farms. Resistance differed (P < .05) among E. coli from pigs compared to their respective sows for apramycin and carbadox on low-use farms, whereas incidence of resistance on high-use farms differed (P < .05) between sows and pigs for apramycin and oxytetracycline. These data indicate that patterns of antibiotic resistance are dependent on age of pig and level of antibiotic use.
