Penicillin binding protein (PBP) 2' is the most important mechanism of the resistance to beta-lactams in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). And the mecA gene is the coding gene of PBP2', and located in the SmaI fragment G of the chromosome map by Pattle P.A.,. A part of the structure of mecA is similar to that of the penicillinase gene. The resistance of MRSA to beta-lactams were influenced by the presence of penicillinase plasmid and the alternation of femA gene.
