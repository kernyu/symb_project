There is an increasing awareness of the importance of cross-infection control in dental clinics and laboratories. This study evaluates the effects of various disinfecting solutions on the surface hardness of an acrylic resin denture base material. Hardness was measured as resistance to indentation following the method specified by the British Standards Institute. The results demonstrated that immersion of denture base acrylic resin in disinfecting solution for up to 24 hours resulted in no significant effect on hardness values.
