The multidrug resistance phenotype is often associated with overexpression of P-glycoprotein, an energy-dependent efflux pump responsible for decreased intracellular accumulation of chemotherapeutic agents. The role of P-glycoprotein in the mechanism of cross-resistance to melphalan in multidrug-resistant Chinese hamster ovary cells (CH(R)C5) was investigated by photoaffinity labelling of P-glycoprotein using [3H]azidopine. We investigated whether the chemosensitiser cyclosporin A and hyperthermia, either used alone or combined, could reverse melphalan resistance and alter transport processes for [14C]melphalan in CH(R)C5 cells. Melphalan inhibited azidopine photolabelling of P-glycoprotein, implicating drug efflux mediated by P-glycoprotein in the mechanism of melphalan resistance in CH(R)C5 cells. Azidopine photolabelling also was inhibited by the chemosensitiser cyclosporin A, which binds to P-glycoprotein. Cyclosporin A alone reversed melphalan resistance in CH(R)C5 cells, but had no effect in drug-sensitive AuxB1 cells. Hyperthermia (40-45 degrees) alone increased melphalan cytotoxicity in both cell lines. When hyperthermia was combined with cyclosporin A, a large increase in melphalan cytotoxicity occurred, but only in CH(R)C5 cells. This effect increased with temperature and exposure time. Sensitisation to melphalan cytotoxicity by heat and cyclosporin A in CH(R)C5 cells appeared to be explained by altered drug transport processes. Lower accumulation of melphalan occurred in CH(R)C5 cells than in drug-sensitive cells. At 37 degrees, cyclosporin A increased drug accumulation in CH(R)C5 cells, but not in AuxB1 cells, by slowing drug efflux from cells. Heat alone increased both melphalan uptake and drug efflux for both cell lines. Our findings suggest that the combination of cyclosporin A and hyperthermia could be very useful in overcoming melphalan resistance by increasing intracellular drug accumulation in multidrug-resistant cells.
