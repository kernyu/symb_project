This paper reports the results of the sensitivity test to 10 antibiotics and the assay of R-plasmid on 286 strains of Gram-negative bacteria isolated from hospitals. It was found that the main prevalent resistant bacteria are Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Their major antibiotic resistance spectrum is: Ampicillin, Carbenicillin, Chloramphemicol, Gentamicin, Furbenicillin. The results showed that 272 of 283 strains resisted to 1-9 antibiotics (95.1%). One-hundred and seventy-eight of 286 strains resisted to more than 4 antibiotics (62.2%). One-hundred and fifty-one of 286 strains carried R-plasmid in resistant bacteria (53.3%). 13.3% resistance markers were transferred with the whole R-factor. But 86.7% resistance markers were transferred with only a part of R-factor.
