o-Fluoro-DL-phenylalanine (OFP)-resistant mutants which overproduce beta-phenethyl-alcohol were isolated from a laboratory strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Cells of one of the mutants accumulated tyrosine and phenylalanine 1.5-3 fold more than did wild-type cells. Its 3-deoxy-D-arabino-hepturosonate-7-phosphate (DAHP) synthase (EC 4.1.2.15), encoded by ARO4, was free from feedback inhibition by tyrosine. Genetic analysis revealed that the mutation was controlled by a single dominant gene, ARO4-OFP, encoding feedback-resistant DAHP synthase by tyrosine, and that this gene caused both the OFP resistance and beta-phenethyl-alcohol overproduction. This was supported by molecular genetic studies using cloned ARO4 both from the wild-type and its mutant strain.
