Interferon gamma (IFN gamma) represents an essential cytokine involved in murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) clearance from the salivary gland and the control of horizontal transmission. Because IFN gamma cannot be responsible for all cytokine effects during recovery from MCMV infection we have now tested the potential participation of tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) in the antiviral defence. Neutralization of endogenous TNF alpha abolished the antiviral activity of CD4 T cells in immunocompetent as well as in CD8 subset-deficient mice. These data suggest that the antiviral effect of the CD4 subset requires the presence of at least two cytokines, namely IFN gamma and TNF alpha. Depletion of endogenous TNF alpha in adoptive cell transfer recipients diminished the antiviral function of CD8 T lymphocytes suggesting that TNF alpha also participates in CD8 T cell effector functions. Furthermore, endogenous cytokines were found to be required for survival after infection with lethal doses of MCMV, whereas immunotherapy with recombinant TNF alpha and IFN gamma could not limit virus replication in vivo. The results suggest that, similar to IFN gamma, TNF alpha is an integral part of the protective mechanisms involved in cytomegalovirus clearance.
