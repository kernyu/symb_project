To identify epidemiological features of culture-proven campylobacter infections and to determine resistance rates, we conducted a 4-year demographic survey of culture-proven campylobacteriosis in one Dutch region. Examination of 24,435 fecal specimens revealed 1,315 cases of campylobacteriosis (5.4%). The ofloxacin-resistance rate among Campylobacter isolates increased from 11% to 29%. Resistance against tetracycline fluctuated between 7% and 15%, and resistance against erythromycin remained low. Resistance against fluoroquinolones was seasonally influenced, with relatively high rates during winter. We conclude that resistance of Campylobacter isolates to fluoroquinolones is still rising, probably because of the use of fluoroquinolones (enrofloxacin) in animal husbandry.
