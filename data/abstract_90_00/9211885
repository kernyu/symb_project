Translation of a 5-codon mini-gene encoded in Escherichia coli 23 S rRNA was previously shown to render cells resistant to erythromycin (Tenson, T., DeBlasio, A., and Mankin, A. S. (1996) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 93, 5641-5646). Erythromycin resistance was mediated by a specific interaction of the 23 S rRNA-encoded pentapeptide with the ribosome. In the present study, peptides conferring erythromycin resistance were selected from in vivo expressed random peptide libraries to study structural features important for peptide activity. Screening of a 21-codon mini-gene library (the general structure ATG (NNN)20 TAA) demonstrated that only short peptides (3-6 amino acids long) conferred erythromycin resistance. Sequence comparison of erythromycin resistance peptides isolated from the 5-codon library (ATG (NNN)4 TAA) revealed a strong preference for leucine or isoleucine as a third amino acid and a hydrophobic amino acid at the C terminus of the peptide. When tested against other antibiotics, erythromycin resistance peptides rendered cells resistant to other macrolides, oleandomycin and spiramycin, but not to chloramphenicol or clindamycin. Defining the consensus amino acid sequence of erythromycin resistance peptides provided insights into a possible mode of peptide action and the nature of the peptide binding site on the ribosome.
