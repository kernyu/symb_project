Investigation of restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) associated with immunoglobulin E (IgE) and cytokine genes in the sheep genome revealed polymorphisms in the IgE constant heavy chain, interferon gamma and interleukin 4 genes. No polymorphisms were found in interleukin 1 beta or tumour necrosis factor alpha. PstI and BamHI RFLPs in the IgE gene showed differences in frequency between animals selected for resistance or susceptibility to fleece rot and blowfly strike.
