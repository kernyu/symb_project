Seven spontaneous norfloxacin (NFLX)-resistant mutants obtained in vitro from 20 NFLX-susceptible clinical isolates and 3 NFLX-resistant clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were transformed with the pNF111 plasmid, whose BamHI fragment is responsible for conferring susceptibility to NFLX, by complementing the nfxB mutation. The resulting patterns of MICs of NFLX, beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, and chloramphenicol and the observed increased accumulation of NFLX were consistent with the occurrence of the nfxB type mutation in these clinical isolates.
