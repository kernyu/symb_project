The in vitro antimicrobial activities of AM-1155, a new fluoroquinolone, tosufloxacin and fleroxacin were tested against 55 clinical isolates of Neisseria gonorrhoeae using the agar dilution method. In our previous study, all the strains had been examined for mutations in the region corresponding to the quinolone-resistance determining region of the Escherichia coli gyrA gene and the analogous region of the parC gene, and tested for susceptibility to ciprofloxacin. In this study, the 55 isolates of N. gonorrhoeae were assigned to one of three categories based on the presence or absence of alterations in GyrA and ParC. In each category, the antimicrobial activity of AM-1155 against the isolates was compared with those of tosufloxacin and fleroxacin. The MICs of AM-1155 for 11 highly fluoroquinolone-resistant isolates with alterations in both GyrA and ParC ranged from 0.06 to 1.0 microgram/ml. The MICs inhibiting 50% (MIC50) and 90% (MIC90) of these isolates were 0.125 and 1.0 microgram/ml, respectively. The MICs of AM-1155 for 20 moderately fluoroquinolone-resistant isolates with alterations only in GyrA ranged from 0.03 to 0.25 microgram/ml (MIC50, 0.06 microgram/ml; MIC90m, 0.125 microgram/ml). The MICs of AM-1155 for 24 of the quinolone-susceptible isolates without alterations in either GyrA or ParC ranged from 0.004 to 0.03 microgram/ml (MIC50, 0.008 microgram/ml. MIC90, 0.015 microgram/ml). There were significant differences between the MIC distribution of AM-1155 and each corresponding MIC distribution of tosufloxacin and fleroxacin in these three categories to which the 55 isolates were assigned (p < 0.05). Based on the MIC90S of the tested fluoroquinolones, AM-1155 was two- and eightfold more active against the highly fluoroquinolone-resistant isolates than tosufloxacin and fleroxacin, respectively. Against the moderately fluoroquinolone-resistant isolates, AM-1155 was four- and sixteenfold more active than tosufloxacin and fleroxacin, respectively. Against the quinolone-susceptible strains, AM-1155 was also two- to fourfold more active than the other fluoroquinolones. Overall, AM-1155 exhibited more potent in vitro activity against both quinolone-resistant and quinolone-susceptible isolates of N. gonorrhoeae than tosufloxacin and fleroxacin. In ciprofloxacin treatment failures of gonorrhea at single doses of 500 mg. MICs for the causative organisms have ranged from 1.0 to 16.0 micrograms/ml. The MICs of AM-1155 for the isolates harboring quinolone resistance-associated genetic alterations, including strains exhibiting ciprofloxacin MICs of 2.0 and 8.0 micrograms/ml, still ranged from 0.03 to 1.0 microgram/mL A single-dose study in humans has demonstrated higher peak serum concentrations and longer half-lives of AM-1155, resulting in the AUC0-00 values of AM-1155, which are threefold greater than those of ciprofloxacin at the single doses of 400 and 600 mg. Because of its potent in vitro antimicrobial activity and advantageous pharmacokinetic behavior, AM-1155 may be a clinically useful agent for treating gonorrhea including that caused by quinolone-resistant strains.
