Results of previous investigations suggested that the conjugative transposons found in human colonic Bacteroides species were all members of a closely related family of elements, exemplified by Tcr Emr DOT. We have now found a new type of conjugative transposon, Tcr Emr 7853, that does not belong to this family. Tcr Emr 7853 has approximately the same size as the Tcr Emr DOT-type elements (70 to 80 kbp) and also carries genes encoding resistance to tetracycline (Tcr) and erythromycin (Emr); however, it differs from previously described conjugative transposons in a number of ways. Its transfer is not regulated by tetracycline and its transfer genes are not controlled by the regulatory genes rteA and rteB, which are found on Tcr Emr DOT and related conjugative transposons. Its ends do not cross-hybridize with the ends of Tcr Emr DOT-type conjugative transposons, and the Emr gene it carries does not cross-hybridize with ermF, the Emr gene found on all previously studied Bacteroides conjugative transposons. There is only one region with high sequence similarity between Tcr Emr 7853 and previously characterized elements, the region that contains the Tcr gene, tetQ. This sequence similarity ends 145 bp upstream of the start codon and 288 bp downstream from the stop codon. A 2-kbp region upstream of tetQ on Tcr Emr 7853 cross-hybridized with four additional EcoRV fragments of Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron 7853 DNA other than the one that contained tetQ. These additional cross-hybridizing bands were not part of Tcr Emr 7853, but one of them cotransferred with Tcr Emr 7853 in some matings. Thus, at least one of the additional cross-hybridizing bands may be associated with another conjugative element or with an element that is mobilized by Tcr Emr 7853. DNA that cross-hybridized with the upstream region was found in one clinical isolate of Bacteroides ovatus and four Tcr isolates of Prevotella ruminicola.
