Stable transformation of plants by Agrobacterium T-DNAs requires that the transgene insert into the host chromosome. Although most of the Agrobacterium Ti plasmid genes required for this process have been studied in depth, few plant-encoded factors have been identified, although such factors, presumably DNA repair proteins, are widely presumed to exist. It has previously been suggested that the UVH1 gene product is required for stable T-DNA integration in Arabidopsis. Here we present evidence suggesting that uvh1 mutants are essentially wild type for T-DNA integration following inoculation via the vacuum-infiltration procedure.
