A comparative restriction analysis was made for DNA in malaria parasites, strain H sensitive to chloroquinone, strain LNK-65 with spontaneously occurred resistance to the agent, and breeding strain LNK-65 ChlR highly resistant to it. DNA hydrolysis with EcoR1, HindIII, and BamH1 endonucleases revealed permanent differences in the DNA restriction pattern of malaria parasites. There were additional restriction bands as part of DNA restricts in the strain LNK-65 Chl bred from LNK-65 for high resistance to chloroquine on EcoR1-, HindIII-, and BamH1-hydrolysis. Great differences in the DNA restriction pattern in the strains H and LNK-65 are likely to be due to their belonging to various strains, such as P.berghei and P.yoelii, respectively. Comparison of the DNA restriction pattern of the host (murine leukocytes) and the malaria parasite suggests the plasmodium DNA is adequately removed from the host DNA.
