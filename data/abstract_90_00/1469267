OBJECTIVES: To compare the clinical virulence of nosocomially acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and methicillin-sensitive S aureus (MSSA) infections in 1989. DESIGN: A retrospective comparison of host factors, in-hospital exposures, sites of infections, and outcomes of patients with nosocomial MRSA and MSSA infections. SETTING: University of Illinois Hospital, Chicago, Illinois. PARTICIPANTS: Forty-four adult patients with nosocomial S aureus infections. RESULTS: The 22 MRSA-infected and 22 MSSA-infected persons were similar regarding mean age, gender, underlying diseases, and exposure to surgery. Before developing infection, MRSA-infected persons were more likely to have received antibiotics (73% compared with 27%, odds ratio = 7.1, 95% confidence interval [CI95] = 2.0-25.8 p = .003) and to have stayed in the hospital > 2 weeks (64% compared with 18%, odds ratio = 7.9, CI95 = 2.0-31.6, p = .002). Bacteremia was the most common presentation in the MRSA and MSSA groups (55% and 59%, respectively). Infectious complications and death were infrequent in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: MRSA and MSSA strains infect patients with similar demographic features and underlying diseases, but MRSA infections are significantly more common among patients with previous antibiotic therapy and a prolonged preinfection hospital stay. Clinical presentations and outcomes did not differ significantly between the 2 groups. Thus, similar to studies in the early 1980s, our findings do not suggest greater intrinsic virulence of MRSA.
