Resistance to rifampin (RMP) is associated with mutations in the rpoB gene. Disk elution method, direct DNA sequencing and line probe assay were compared in rapid detection of rpoB mutations from 30 Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates. Concordance between LiPA and culture was 93.3%, whereas sequencing yielded 100% concordance with culture. These results indicate that line probe assay is nearly as sensitive a method as sequencing in rapid detection of RMP-resistance of M. tuberculosis isolates, and can be applied in laboratories working with standard PCR equipment.
