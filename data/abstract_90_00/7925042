During a two-year period, January 1989 to January 1991, 39 (12%) of 331 children admitted to various hospitals and health centres in Enugu and Nsukka areas of Eastern Nigeria with symptoms of meningitis had Haemophilus influenzae isolated from their cerebrospinal fluids (CSF). 90% were aged 24 months and below. Out of the 39 isolates, 37 were Pittman serotype b while the remaining 2 were type d. More males (61.5%) had H. influenzae meningitis in comparison with 38.5% of females. 69.2% of the cases occurred during the dry season while 30.7% occurred during the rainy season. All the isolates were sensitive to chloramphenicol and erythromycin, while 90% were sensitive to ampicillin and penicillin, using the disc diffusion method. The leading role of H. influenzae in meningitis in children who are 7 to 24 months of age in this part of the world and the increasing resistance of this organism to ampicillin and penicillin is hereby stressed.
