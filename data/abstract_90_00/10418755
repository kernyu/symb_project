All 105 non-replicate consecutive Staphylococcus aureus strains isolated in 1997 from seven Greek hospitals, were found to be susceptible to vancomycin, teicoplanin and chloramphenicol, but only five (8%) were susceptible to all 16 antibiotics tested. Forty-three (41%) isolates were methicillin-resistant, 58% homogeneously (homMRSA) and 42% heterogeneously (hetMRSA). Resistance of homMRSA strains to other antibiotics was generally high (88-100%), although only one strain was resistant to netilmicin. Resistance in hetMRSA (6-39%) or in MSSA (5-11%) was significantly lower. Consequently, the majority (76%) of homMRSA were multi-drug resistant, while the dominant phenotype of hetMRSA and MSSA was resistance to penicillin (50% and 76%, respectively). Comparison of these strains with isolates from 1994 showed higher resistance rates to erythromycin among MSSA, to erythromycin and amikacin among hetMRSA and to rifampicin among homMRSA strains.
