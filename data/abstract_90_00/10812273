Trichosporon beigelii is a fungus once thought to cause only superficial infections, but recently has been increasingly identified as an opportunistic systemic pathogen in immunocompromised patients. There have been very limited reports of this organism in the burn patient population. We describe the first report of pharmacological management of invasive T. beigelii with a combination of amphotericin B and high dose fluconazole in a burn patient. Antifungal susceptibility testing of T. beigelii determined a change in minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of amphotericin B and a consistent resistance pattern with the use of flucytosine. This paper will review our experience with T. beigelii fungus in a regional burn treatment center and review the literature on other experiences in the burn population.
