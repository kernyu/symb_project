Resistance to infectious diseases in bivalves depends primarily on the vigour and efficacy of haemocyte-dependent antimicrobial defence mechanisms. Like other phagocytes, haemocytes seem to rely on oxygen-independent (lysosomal hydrolases, lysozyme) and oxygen-dependent (reactive oxygen species) mechanisms to destroy ingested microorganisms. The generation of cytotoxic oxyradicals by haemocytes can be precisely quantified by means of a simple chemiluminescence (CL) assay using luminol or other CL probes. Tributyltin (TBT), and other environmental contaminants, at sublethal levels, will produce dose-dependent suppression of CL activity in haemocytes exposed in short-term, in vitro assays. Presumably, this suppression would find expression as impaired host defence capability. In fact, TBT has been shown to exacerbate progression and lethality of Perkinsus marinus infections in the oyster, Crassostrea virginica. This suggests that CL assays on haemocytes exposed in vitro to single agents or complex mixtures might be useful in screening for aquatic immunomodulators. Statistically significant alterations in CL responses of haemocytes withdrawn from bivalves exposed to xenobiotics in the laboratory or field are more difficult to identify because of high inter-animal variation; however, the use of haemocyte CL as a biomarker of effect merits further investigation.
