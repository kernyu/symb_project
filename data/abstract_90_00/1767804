The relationship of virulence and antimicrobial susceptibility with morbidity due to bacterial respiratory pathogens is complex and evolving. Ultimately, decreasing the incidence of pneumonia due to bacterial pathogens will be dependent on successful preparation and distribution of effective vaccines. Until effective vaccines are widely available, control of a majority of respiratory infections will depend on promotion of rational therapeutic strategies. Though limited to a few specific serotypes and strains, changes in virulence of bacterial respiratory pathogens have been noted. Co-infections due to multiple respiratory pathogens may increase morbidity; however, the epidemiology of co-infections is not clear. Relationships between respiratory viruses and bacteria may exist that increase virulence of both agents, but information regarding these relationships awaits further investigation. Resistance of respiratory pathogens to the more commonly used antimicrobials, such as penicillin, erythromycin, chloramphenicol, and cotrimoxazole, is being documented globally with increasing frequency. The evolution of antimicrobic resistance, especially among strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, the most common and deadly agent of lower respiratory tract infections, provides impetus to develop and promote effective pneumococcal vaccines and to search for new and effective antimicrobials.
