The present authors review data from the literature concerning the postantibiotic effect (PAE) and the postantibiotic effect of subinhibitory concentrations (PA SME) of some antibiotics on clinically significant G- and G+ bacterial species. Attention is paid to the influence on their physiological characteristics with regard to virulence factors.
