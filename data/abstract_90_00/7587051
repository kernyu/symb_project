During recent years new mechanisms of beta-lactam resistance have developed with the genetic origin on the chromosome or plasmids. Nevertheless, most multicenter studies can demonstrate that cefotaxime has retained its antibacterial activity toward the relevant species. However, it is important to follow the development of resistance closely in hospitals, where epidemic outbreaks of bacterial strains with extended-spectrum beta-lactamases can create difficulties in the treatment of infectious diseases.
