BACKGROUND: Clinicians and scientists have important and complementary roles to play in improving the management of pediatric infectious diseases. The clinician's role is to provide optimal care for the individual patient, whereas the scientist is closely involved in teaching and research. OBJECTIVES: To review the current challenges in the management of childhood infections and the contributions of different groups to meeting these challenges. DISCUSSION: The pattern of infectious diseases in children is constantly changing, emphasizing the importance of microbiologic research in meeting these challenges. In the clinical setting the research results must be applied and integrated in routine practice. The development and successful clinical use of new diagnostic techniques, new antibiotics and new vaccines provide good examples of the teamwork between scientists and clinicians, which is essential for progress in the field of common childhood infectious diseases. The most urgent challenges in this area that now face physicians are the increasing prevalence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, especially the spread of penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, and the growing numbers of immunocompromised children. Devising and implementing strategies to meet these demands will require a continuing commitment from pediatricians and microbiologists.
