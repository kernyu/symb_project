The metabolic potentialities of an Acinetobacter radioresistens strain, isolated from the soil adjacent to an activated sludge plant, were investigated. Among 26 aromatic substrates tested, only phenol, benzoate and catechol were metabolized. Since this strain possessed abundant plasmid DNA, the antibiotic and heavy metal resistance was examined, and the bacterial cells proved to be sensitive to all metals (Ni, Tl, Pb, Cd, Ag, Co, Zn) and antibiotics tested except for Fosfomycin and chloramphenicol. The degradation kinetics for phenol and benzoate as the sole carbon/energy source (pH 7, 30 degrees C) displayed different trends, confirmed by the bacterial growth curve. Crude extracts from phenol-grown cultures showed both phenol hydroxylating activity and catechol dioxygenating activity. Phenol hydroxylase possessed a reductase component able to reduce nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) and cytochrome C, thus exhibiting differences from previously reported monocomponent phenol hydroxylases from the same genus. Catechol dioxygenase is an intradiol-cleaving enzyme recognizing also substituted catechols.
