The resistance to antibiotics of the 985 clinical isolates collected in Tian Tan hospital was studied. The results showed that S. aureus had a resistant rate of more than 90% to penicillin and was also highly resistant to erythromycin. Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA) was isolated in 15.6% of all the isolates with S. aureus. The isolation rate of MRSA is lower than that in other countries or districts of West Pacific Area. K. pneumonia and other Gram negative bacilli had a resistant rate of 0.6% to amikacin and P. aeruginosa was all sensitive to Polymyxin-B.
