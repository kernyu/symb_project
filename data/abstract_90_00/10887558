The minimum inhibitory concentration of fluconozole was determined in 36 strains of Cryptococcus neoformans var. neoformans by a casitone broth microdilution method, taking into account that it is one of the most used antifungal agents in our country for the treatment of cryptococcal meningitis, the second opportunistic mycosis in order of frequency and that with the highest lethality among AIDS patients. The minimum inhibitory concentration of the studied strains ranged 0.125 to more than 64 micrograms/mL for a geometrical mean of 2.38 micrograms/mL. 50% of the strains were inhibited with 4 micrograms/mL and the least concentration that inhibited 90% was 16 micrograms/mL. It is stressed the importance of continuing this type of in vitro studies to detect the appearance of resistance of C. neoformans to antifungal agents.
