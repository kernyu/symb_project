To cure the long-term carriage of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), eradication treatment was given to 10 patients wearing complete dentures. In addition to multiple body sites, MRSA was cultured from the dentures of six patients. The contaminated dentures were rebased and sterilized with heat in order to prevent recolonization. The patients did not use their dentures during the decolonization therapy. Subsequently, MRSA was eradicated from three of these patients but three others remained MRSA-positive despite at least two courses of combined systemic and topical eradication treatment. These particular patients had persistent stomatitis and their dentures were a poor fit, in poor condition and repeatedly grew MRSA. Eradication treatment was successful in the remaining four patients whose dentures were MRSA-negative. These results confirm that dentures may function as foreign bodies and sustain persistent nasopharyngeal. MRSA colonization. Therefore, we suggest that whenever eradication of MRSA is deemed necessary in cases of nasal, oral or pharyngeal carriage, heat treatment of the dentures should be included. Further comparative studies with larger patient populations are needed to evaluate the contribution of dentures to the long-term carriage of MRSA, as well as to assess the value of denture sterilization during the eradication course.
