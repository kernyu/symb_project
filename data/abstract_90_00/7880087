A study of bacterial organisms isolated from 65 Nigerian children who had urinary tract infection (UTI) is reported. The predominant isolate in both inpatients and outpatients was Klebsiella species which accounted for 52.8% of cases. Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas spp and Proteus spp accounted for 25.0%, 15.3% and 5.5% of isolates, respectively. All isolates were poorly sensitive to the common first-line drugs used in UTI in our environment, namely, cotrimoxazole and ampicillin, but exhibited good sensitivity to nalidixic acid, nitrofurantoin and ofloxacin. It is recommended that nitrofurantoin and nalidixic acid be used for blind treatment of UTI in Nigerian children in Ibadan while results of culture and sensitivity are awaited. Continuous monitoring of the pattern of organisms isolated in childhood UTI and their antibiotic resistance patterns is recommended as an essential step in guiding blind antibiotic therapy in such cases.
