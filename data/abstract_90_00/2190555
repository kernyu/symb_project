Near-ultraviolet (NUV) radiation and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) inactivation studies were performed on Escherichia coli K-12 DNA adenine methylation (dam) mutants and on cells that carry plasmids which overexpress Dam methylase. Lack of methylation resulted in increased sensitivity to NUV and H2O2 (a photoproduct of NUV). In a dam mutant carrying a dam plasmid, the levels of Dam enzyme and resistance to NUV and H2O2 were restored. However, using a multicopy dam+ plasmid strain, increasing the methylase above wildtype levels resulted in an increase in sensitivity of the cells rather than resistance.
