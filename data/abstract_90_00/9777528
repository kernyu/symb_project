For the last fifty years, the nose has been intermittently recognized and targeted as a source of Staphylococcus aureus causing surgical site infection. In London in 1959, Williams and co-workers established for the first time that nasal carriers had increased rates of surgical sepsis compared with non-carriers. For half of these patients, the source was the patient's own nose. Post-admission acquisition of tetracycline-resistant strains was associated with even higher rates of infection. The increasing appearance of epidemic methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) in the 1980s rekindled interest in these (largely overlooked) studies, when the elimination of nasal carriage by topical mupirocin proved pivotal for the control of MRSA in Northern Europe and elsewhere. In the late 1980s and 1990s, Boelaert, Holton and others, appreciating the work performed forty years previously, used nasal mupirocin for the successful prevention of sepsis with S. aureus in patients on haemodialysis and continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis without incurring problems with mupirocin resistance. In 1995, Kluytmans and colleagues demonstrated that nasal carriage of S. aureus is a significant risk factor for wound infection after cardiac surgery. Towards the year 2000, the use of prophylactic nasal mupirocin for the prevention of serious sepsis in major clean surgery is emerging as a plausible and exciting new strategy.
