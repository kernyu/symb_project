Drug resistance in enterococci isolated from hospitalized patients is reported. Out of 421 strains tested, 45 (10.7%) showed high level aminoglycoside resistance (HLAR). At the species level, 8.2 per cent of Enterococcus faecalis and 33.3 per cent of E. faecium were HLAR. While all the strains of E. faecalis were sensitive to vancomycin, one strain of E. faecium was vancomycin resistant.
