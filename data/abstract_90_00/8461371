BACKGROUND: Fluconazole-resistant Candida albicans has been seldom reported in the literature. in this study, two clinical cases of oro-esophageal candidosis resistant to this antifungal drug are described. METHOD: Infection was confirmed by isolation of yeasts (culture of mouth swabs, oesophagoscopy and histology of biopsy specimens). In vitro antifungal susceptibility tests were performed with standard methods (NCCLS). RESULTS: Clinical and microbiological fluconazole-resistant Candida albicans was isolated. CONCLUSIONS: Causes of development of resistances are commented, and the role of immunodeficiency and the possibility of a Candida strain selection is discussed.
