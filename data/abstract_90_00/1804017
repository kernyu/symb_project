We have examined 13 clinical isolates of the intestinal Bacteroides group using DNA probes representing Bacteroides macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B (MLS) (ermF) and tetracycline resistance (tetQ) determinants as well as an insertion sequence (IS4351) previously seen in association with erm genes. tetQ-hybridizing sequences were detected in 11 of 13 tetracycline-resistant clinical isolates. On the other hand, ermF-like sequences were detected in only three of eight clindamycin-resistant strains. One isolate displayed low-level, inducible resistance to clindamycin and was sensitive to erythromycin. This same isolate had IS4351-like sequences but was missing ermF-like sequences, in contrast to previous reports which demonstrated the common association of IS4351 and erm genes. Our results suggest the occurrence of unclassified MLS genes in the Bacteroides group and furthermore suggest that IS4351-like sequences are not always linked to Bacteroides ermF-like sequences. Finally, 4 of 13 isolates conjugally transferred tetracycline resistance or linked tetracycline-clindamycin (MLS) resistances, but this process did not involve plasmids.
