We report the construction of two broad host range promoter-probe plasmid vectors for rapid analysis of promoters in Gram-negative bacteria. The new vectors, pME4507 and pME4510, carry carbenicillin and gentamycin resistance genes, respectively, and are small sized (4 kb) with a flexible multiple cloning site to facilitate directional cloning of putative promoter elements. The vectors allow rapid plate-based screening for promoter activities, using beta-galactosidase as the reporter enzyme. In the absence of an inserted promoter fragment, they display very low background activity, making them a useful tool for analysis of low expression level promoters.
