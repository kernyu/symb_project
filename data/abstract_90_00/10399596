The in vitro susceptibility of 91 Plasmodium falciparum isolates obtained from malaria-infected children living near Libreville (Gabon) was evaluated against chloroquine and cycloguanil (biologically active metabolite of proguanil), using an isotopic micro-drug susceptibility test. In vitro resistance to chloroquine and cycloguanil was observed in 83% (35/42) and in 38% (30/78) of the patients, respectively. Our data showed that 41% (16/39) of Gabonese field isolates were resistant both to chloroquine and cycloguanil. These findings are of great importance because they might indicate imminent chloroquine-proguanil failure, and there are not many affordable antimalarial drugs to replace chloroquine-proguanil combination.
