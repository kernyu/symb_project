Antimicrobial resistance trends were examined for 811 salmonella isolates from humans collected in Finland during 1995-1997. The material was divided into domestic and foreign isolates according to the origin of infection. A total of 2.3% of the 387 domestic and 7.8% of the 424 foreign isolates were quinolone-resistant (P < 0.001). Among the domestic isolates we detected an emergence of ciprofloxacin resistance (MIC > or = 0.25 mg/L) with the proportion of resistant isolates increasing from 0 to 2.2% (P = 0.2). Among the foreign isolates this increase was even more dramatic, from 2.0% to 8.4% (P = 0.037) during the study period.
