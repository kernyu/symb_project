The E89G alteration in the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 reverse transcriptase has been shown to confer resistance to nucleoside analogs and a loss of magnesium cation preference (Prasad, V.R., Lowy, I., De Los Santos, T., Chiang, L., and Goff, S.P. (1991) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 88, 11363-11367. The wild type reverse transcriptase heterodimer, chimeric reverse transcriptases that contain the E89G alteration in one of the subunits (p66wt/p51m and p66m/p51wt), and the mutant enzyme (p66m/p51m) were prepared. Analysis of steady state kinetic parameters showed that the mutant enzyme (p66m/p51m) displayed a higher Vmax, a higher Km for 2'-deoxythymidine triphosphate, and a higher Ki for 2',3'-dideoxythymidine triphosphate than the wild type enzyme. The increased Km and Ki values were observed only when a heterodimer contained the alteration in the p66 subunit. Tests for divalent cation requirement showed that only the dimers containing the wild type p66 (p66wt/p51wt and p66wt/p51m) displayed a preference for magnesium. Our results indicate that p66 plays a dominant role in deoxynucleotide triphosphate substrate recognition (Km), nucleoside analog sensitivity (Ki), and magnesium preference. However, the increased Vmax displayed by the mutant enzyme (p66m/p51m) appeared to be determined by both of the subunits.
