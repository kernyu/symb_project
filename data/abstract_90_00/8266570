A dose-dependent stimulation of immunoglobulin synthesis by Spebr-5 cells in the presence of adriamycin is shown. This effect is significantly blocked in the presence of iron-chelating agent 2,2-bipyridine. Moreover, low doses of H2O2 and heat shock also caused enhancement of immunoglobulin synthesis. These data suggest the involvement of free radical processes in the adriamycin induced stimulation of immunoglobulin synthesis.
