Severe Falciparum malaria is associated with multiple organ dysfunction and a high rate of fatal outcome. Appropriate antimalarial chemotherapy and symptomatic treatment may be supplemented by early plasma exchange. Two cases are reported in which there were no chemoprophylaxis and a late diagnosis. Initial parasitaemias were 17% and 5%. The two patients had cerebral malaria with in the first case pulmonary oedema and DIC. Plasma exchange was performed and clinical biological symptoms abated quickly. The mechanisms of action and benefits of plasma exchange are discussed.
