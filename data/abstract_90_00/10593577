The production and role of endogenous cytokines during the course of secondary Corynebacterium (C.) pseudotuberculosis infection were investigated in mice. When immunized mice were challenged on day 28 after primary infection, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) were found to appear at 3 hr and to reach the maximum at 24 hr after challenge. Spleen cells of mice primarily infected from 2 to 8 weeks before produced a significant amount of TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma when stimulated with formalin-killed bacteria. However, they could not produce detectable amounts of IL-4. The administration of anti-TNF-alpha monoclonal antibody (MAb) and IFN-gamma MAb increased bacterial proliferation in the organs of immune mice and exacerbated the secondary infection. Injection of anti-CD4 MAb alone or anti-CD4 plus anti-CD8 MAbs resulted in significantly increased mortality and a marked suppression of bacterial elimination as well as cytokine production of secondarily infected mice, while the treatment with anti-CD8 MAb alone showed no effect on either the resistance or cytokine production of mice. These results suggest that CD4, probably Th1 T cells, play an important role for establishment of protective immunity against secondary C. pseudotuberculosis infection by secreting TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma.
