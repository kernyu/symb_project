The c-fos protooncogene encodes a transcription factor that is thought to play a critical role in proliferation and differentiation as well as in the physiological response of mature cells to their environment. To test directly the role of c-fos in growth and differentiation, we generated mouse embryonic stem cell lines in which both copies of the c-fos gene were specifically disrupted by homologous recombination. Remarkably, the disruption of both copies of c-fos in these cells has no detectable effect on embryonic stem cell viability, growth rate, or differentiation potential. Embryonic stem cells lacking c-fos can differentiate into a wide range of cell types in tissue culture and also in chimeric mice. We conclude that despite a large body of literature suggesting an important role for c-fos in cell growth and differentiation, in at least some cell types this gene is not essential for these processes.
