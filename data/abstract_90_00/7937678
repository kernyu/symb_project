The experimental studies have provided strong evidence that the efficacy of etiotropic therapy for tuberculosis can be enhanced by applying a number of antimicrobial agents having different mechanism of action, which belong to cephalosporins, macrolides, aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones. The basis of the mechanism responsible for potentiation of activity of essential tuberculostatic drugs for potentiation of activity of essential tuberculostatic drugs is enhanced inhibition of the viability of a microbacterial population, prevented development of drug resistance in tuberculosis mycobacteria, and increased function of macrophages.
