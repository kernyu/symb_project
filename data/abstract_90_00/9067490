Cultured human proximal tubule cell monolayers maintained on permeable supports were treated simultaneously with the aminoglycoside antibiotic, gentamicin, and poly-L-aspartic acid (PAA), an inhibitor of aminoglycoside nephrotoxicity. Following 4 days of exposure, cell monolayers were placed into Ussing chambers to allow monitoring of transepithelial electrical properties. For each of the three cell isolates examined, aminoglycoside-induced alterations in electrogenic transport, reflected by changes in short-circuit current (Isc), as well as alterations in paracellular properties, indicated by changes in transepithelial electrical resistance (RT), were diminished in the presence of PAA. Alterations resulting from selective basolateral exposure to gentamicin were unchanged in the case of apically applied PAA and attenuated only when PAA acid was added basolaterally. This is the first demonstration of PAA inhibition of aminoglycoside-induced cellular alterations involving human cells.
