We have previously demonstrated decreased insulin release and insulin resistance in dogs treated with cyclosporine (20 mg/kg/day). In this study we examine the changes caused by a lower CsA dose and evaluate the reversal of these changes. Six animals were treated for 2 weeks with oral CsA (15 mg/kg/day), after which CsA was discontinued. Glucagon stimulation tests (GST) and euglycemic clamp studies (ECS) were used to evaluate changes in insulin release and insulin resistance. GST were performed before CsA, after 2 weeks of CsA, and 3, 9, and 15 days after discontinuing CsA. ECS were performed before CsA, after 2 weeks of CsA, and 2, 4, 8, and 14 days after discontinuing CsA. The mean serum CsA level after 2 weeks of treatment was 188 +/- 28 ng/ml. GST demonstrated decreased insulin release during CsA with recovery and hypersecretion after CsA withdrawal. ECS showed peripheral insulin resistance during CsA with a rapid recovery and a temporary increase in insulin sensitivity after CsA withdrawal. Comparisons were made with our previous study group given 20 mg/kg/day of CsA. In summary, CsA induces a dose-dependent impairment of glucose homeostasis due to inhibition of insulin release and development of peripheral insulin resistance. Withdrawal of short-term CsA at commonly used therapeutic doses results in reversal of and temporary overcompensation for these changes. CsA withdrawal after long-term treatment results in a slower normalization of the insulin response as compared with after short-term treatment. The hypersecretory reaction of the beta cell may be of help in further investigations of mechanisms of CsA- and FK506-induced inhibition of insulin release.
