Azithromycin has adequate tissue levels for 7 days with a 3 day treatment regimen. The antibacterial activity is excellent. In dental infections, recurrence of infection happens when antibiotics cause a temporary improvement in symptoms but the etiologic agent is not eradicated. Azithromycin produces a "focused" cure and is an appropriate antibiotic for these infections. For this reason, the antibiotic was approved.
