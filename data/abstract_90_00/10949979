Between July 1998 and July 1999, 2,644 clinical isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae were collected from 27 study centers in 13 countries and their susceptibilities to penicillin, cefaclor and loracarbef were determined by E-test" (AB BIODISK, Solna, Sweden). Overall, 96.3% of isolates were penicillin-susceptible (79.8%) or -intermediate (16.6%) (MIC, < or = 1 microg/ml). Rates of penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae isolation varied widely and were highest in the study centers tested in New Zealand (10.9%), Canada (10.0%), Mexico (9.1%) and the United States (5.1%). Low rates of penicillin-resistance were found in the study centers tested in Russia (0%), Turkey (0%), Brazil (0.5%), Germany (0.6%), Philippines (1.6%), Italy (2.1%), United Kingdom (2.3%), Australia (3.0%) and Poland (3.1%). Using recently published NCCLS interpretative breakpoints (M100-S10, 2000), 87.2% (median) of all isolates tested were cefaclor-susceptible and 87.8% (median) of all isolates tested were loracarbef-susceptible. Of the penicillin-susceptible S. pneumoniae isolates, 99.5% were susceptible to both cefaclor and loracarbef. Susceptibility to cefaclor and loracarbef was also retained by 30.8% and 32.9% of penicillin-intermediate isolates, respectively. These findings are in contrast to recent publications reporting lower cefaclor and loracarbef activities using non-validated interpretative criteria. In conclusion, rates of penicillin resistance among recent clinical isolates of pneumococci remain low in many centers worldwide. Cefaclor and loracarbef demonstrated excellent in vitro activity against recent clinical isolates of penicillin-susceptible and many isolates of penicillin-intermediate S. pneumoniae.
