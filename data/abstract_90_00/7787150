Short-term cyclosporine (CsA) has been shown to reduce the proteinuria in refractory nephrotic syndrome, but the effect on disease progression has not been evaluated. This study was undertaken to evaluate whether maintenance CsA therapy in steroid-resistant focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) will prevent progression to ESRD. Twenty-one black and Hispanic children (mean age, 8.4 +/- 4.5 yr) with biopsy-proven, steroid/cyclophosphamide-resistant FSGS were treated with CsA (initiated at 6 mg/kg per day and titrated to the serum cholesterol level to achieve a response). The mean CsA dose was 7 (4 to 20) mg/kg per day, the duration of CsA therapy was 27.5 (3 to 97) months, and the duration of follow-up was 8.5 +/- 4.7 yr. At the end of CsA therapy, the mean (+/- SE) proteinuria fell from 6.2 +/- 0.2 to 2.0 +/- 0.1 g/24 h (P < 0.001), the mean albumin rose from 1.95 +/- 0.04 to 3.41 +/- 0.04 g/dL (P < 0.001), the mean cholesterol decreased from 472 +/- 12.7 to 257 +/- 5.3 mg/dL (P < 0.005), and the mean creatinine rose from 0.79 +/- 0.02 to 1.16 +/- 0.03 mg/dL (P < 0.005). Seven children continue to receive maintenance CsA therapy, and 14 patients have had CsA stopped: 6 for an increase in serum creatinine and/or continued proteinuria, 5 for sustained remission, 2 for noncompliance, and 1 for pregnancy. Five (24%) of the 21 patients progressed to ESRD.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
