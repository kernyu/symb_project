From January through December 1988 the causative factor of each case of childhood seizure seen in the Children's Emergency Room of the University of Calabar Teaching Hospital, Calabar, Nigeria, was prospectively studied with a focus on the relative importance of malaria-related seizures. Of the 134 seizure cases seen, febrile convulsion (FC) formed the majority (55%) with cerebral malaria (CM) as the only major (33%) rival. Other conditions such as meningitis, epilepsy, hypoglycaemia and drug poisoning together (12%) played a minor role. Malaria was the dominant cause (73%) of FC; 81% of these cases did not respond to chloroquine. On comparing the number of cases of CM accumulated in the same unit from 1986, there was a significant increase (P < 0.001) in the proportion of yearly CM admissions from 1986 through 1988. The study confirms the premier position of malaria in the causation of childhood seizures and also suggests a possible upsurge in the prevalence of CM in the environment. This upsurge probably derives from the emergence of chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium falciparum (CRPF) reported in Nigeria which appeared to have been identified in the present study. While more studies are needed to confirm this hypothesis, clinicians in areas of CRPF are alerted about a possible upsurge in CM in their locality.
