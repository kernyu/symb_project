Three hundred and twenty two Shigella cultures isolated from dysentery patients within 1986-1989 were tested with the use of standard paper disks for their sensitivity to levomycetin, streptomycin, tetracycline, monomycin, neomycin, kanamycin, erythromycin, gentamicin, carbenicillin, ampicillin, oxacillin, methicillin and doxycycline. The number of the cultures belonging to Shigella sonnei amounted to 85.1 per cent of the total number of the strains studied. 91.9, 89.5, 87.3, 87.3, 80.1 and 80.1 per cent of the cultures were sensitive to gentamicin, kanamycin, carbenicillin, neomycin, levomycetin and ampicillin, respectively. 99.4 per cent of the isolates were resistant to streptomycin and 97.2 per cent were resistant to tetracycline. The sensitivity to erythromycin remained rather high (70.2 per cent). The overwhelming majority of the Shigella sonnei isolates had multiple resistance.
