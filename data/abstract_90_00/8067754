Enterococcus faecalis SF350 is a clinical isolate from Winnipeg, Canada, with high-level (MIC > 2,000 micrograms/ml) gentamicin resistance. The genetic determinant for gentamicin resistance was located on the chromosome of SF350 and could be mobilized by a coresident conjugative plasmid, pYN120. Genetic and physical analyses showed that the gentamicin resistance determinant was located on a 27-kb transposable element which was designated Tn924.
