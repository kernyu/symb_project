The aim of the study was to determine the activity of four beta-lactam antibiotics against nosocomial strains of Gram-positive bacteria. Two antibiotics combined with beta-lactamase inhibitors: timentin (TIC/CLAV) and tazocin (PIP/TZB) and two carbapenems: imipenem and meropenem were applied. The clinical strains were isolated from patients hospitalized in surgical ward of the National Clinical Hospital No 1 in Warsaw. The strains were identified in the automatic ATB system using ID 32 STAPH, API STREP, API CORYNE and API 20 A strips. The susceptibility of isolates to antibacterial agents was determined in the automatic ATB system using ATB STAPH, ATB STREP and ATB ANA strips. The susceptibility of strains to timentin, tazocin, imipenem and meropenem was tested with disc diffusion method. 111 strains of Gram-positive bacteria were cultured. Staphylococci (49) and enterococci (44) dominated among isolated strains. 33 Staphylococcus spp. strains were identified as methicillin-resistant. The obtained results indicate a significant role of Gram-positive cocci (staphylococci and enterococci) in the aetiology of nosocomial infections. Antibiotics combined with beta-lactamase inhibitors and carbapenems demonstrate broad antibacterial spectrum against clinical strains of Gram-positive bacteria except E. faecium strains.
