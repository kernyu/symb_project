A correlation between the multiple drug resistance patterns and the plasmid profiles given by 70 clinical isolates of Shigella sonnei and Shigella flexneri was investigated in this study. The most common plasmids were purified from different isolates by electroelution and characterized via restriction endonuclease digestions.
