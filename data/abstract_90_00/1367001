Plasmid pTV1ts was introduced into Staphylococcus aureus by transformation of protoplasts at frequencies ranging from 6.6 x 10(1) to 2.8 x 10(5) per micrograms of DNA when selection was made for resistance to chloramphenicol and erythromycin, respectively. Phenotypic analysis of regenerated transformants demonstrated three distinct classes. Analysis of the plasmid profiles of several isolates revealed that two classes harboured deleted pTV1ts derivatives.
