The incidence of organisms resistant to various antimicrobial agents has risen over the last several years, resulting in an increase in morbidity and mortality and overall treatment costs. The emergence of virtually untreatable infections has focused the medical community's attention on this issue. This paper reviews common pathogens (both nosocomial and community-acquired infections) that have become resistant to antimicrobial drugs. Approaches that may prevent or retard the development, of resistance among these organisms are discussed.
