Fungal infections have become an important cause of mortality in patients with hematological malignancies. In recent years, fungi such as Candida tropicalis, Aspergillus spp, Fusarium spp and Trichosporon spp have emerged as important pathogens. Amphotericin B remains the antifungal agent with the broadest spectrum of activity, although some of the newer pathogens may be resistant. The administration of this drug in lipid vehicles reduces the toxicities, permitting the administration of higher doses that may be more effective. The new agents, fluconazole and itraconazole, have activity against some fungal pathogens, although their role in therapy has not been fully determined. Fluconazole has been shown to be effective for prophylaxis of Candida infections.
