A modified version of a simplified in vivo test was applied to assess the susceptibility of Plasmodium falciparum to chloroquine among semi-immune febrile children in Kouroussa, Guinea. In 27% of cases, a partial response (RI/RII) to chloroquine was observed; the remainder showed a good response (S/RI). This test is both practical and useful to assess the efficacy of chloroquine at the intermediate level of health care services.
