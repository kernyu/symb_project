A major reason for brain tissue vulnerability to oxidative damage is the high content of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). Oligodendroglia-like OLN 93 cells lack PUFAs and are relatively insensitive to oxidative stress. When grown in serum-free defined medium in the presence of 0.1 mM docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22:6 n-3) for 3 days, OLN 93 cells release in the medium 2.6-fold more thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) after a 30-min exposure to 0.1 mM H2O2 and 50 microM Fe2+. Release of TBARS was substantially decreased by approximately 20 and 30% on coincubation with either 1 mM N-monomethylethanolamine or N,N'-dimethylethanolamine (dEa), respectively. The protective effect of dEa was concentration- and time-dependent and was still visible after dEa removal, suggesting a long-lasting mechanism of protection. After 24 h following H2O2-induced stress, cell death monitored by cell sorting showed 16% of the cells in the sub-G1 area, indicative of apoptotic cell death. DHA-supplemented cultures showed 35% cell death, whereas cosupplements with dEa reduced cell death to 12%, indicating cell rescue. Although the exact mechanism for this protection is not known, the nature of the polar head group and the degree of unsaturation may determine the ultimate resistance of nerve cells to oxidative stress.
