Two different methods, (i) PEG and (ii) biolistic, were employed to transform protoplasts and conidia of Paecilomyces fumosoroseus using hygromycin resistance as selectable marker. Transformation frequencies varied from 1.9 to 2.5 transformants microgram-1 of DNA by the PEG method, and from 33 to 153 transformants microgram-1 of DNA by the biolistic procedure.
