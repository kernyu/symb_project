The influence of a new oral cephalosporin cefpodoxime, on several interactions of the host-parasite relationship was investigated. Pretreatment of polymorphonuclear granulocytes (PNG) with cefpodoxime at therapeutical dosage in vitro did not have a significant effect on chemotaxis and luminol-dependent chemiluminescence. On the other hand, human serum did not exert a considerable effect on the bactericidal activity of cefpodoxime on Klebsiella pneumoniae and Staph. aureus. Serum resistance of Klebsiella pneumoniae was not altered after pretreatment with cefpodoxime 1/16 MIC (0.03 micrograms/ml) for 3 to 27 hours.
