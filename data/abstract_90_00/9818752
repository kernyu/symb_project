In this study we demonstrate that hexahydrocolupulone (HHC) more effectively inhibits the growth in vitro of Gram-positive organisms than Mycobacterium tuberculosis or Escherichia coli. Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and coagulase-negative staphylococci were inhibited by HHC at concentrations < or = 4.06 mg/L. Growth inhibition profiles varied according to the microorganism evaluated (static for S. aureus and bactericidal for Bacillus subtilis).
