Atypical P. vivax cases reported in Manaus municipality led us to detect a genetic isolate of P. vivax. Variable regions of SSUrRNA were examined from the initial time of infection and in the two recrudescences/relapses from a patient exhibiting chloroquine and primaquine resistance. A unique isolate, found at all stages of infection, suggests the presence of a clonal expansion.
