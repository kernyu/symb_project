Accumulation of tetracycline in Escherichia coli was studied to determine its permeation pathway and to provide a basis for understanding efflux-mediated resistance. Passage of tetracycline across the outer membrane appeared to occur preferentially via the porin OmpF, with tetracycline in its magnesium-bound form. Rapid efflux of magnesium-chelated tetracycline from the periplasm was observed. In E. coli cells that do not contain exogenous tetracycline resistance genes, the steady-state level of tetracycline accumulation was decreased when porins were absent or when the fraction of Mg(2+)-chelated tetracycline was small. This is best explained by assuming the presence of a low-level endogenous active efflux system that bypasses the outer membrane barrier. When influx of tetracycline is slowed, this efflux is able to reduce the accumulation of tetracycline in the cytoplasm. In contrast, we found no evidence of a special outer membrane bypass mechanism for high-level efflux via the Tet protein, which is an inner membrane efflux pump coded for by exogenous tetA genes. Fractionation and equilibrium density gradient centrifugation experiments showed that the Tet protein is not localized to regions of inner and outer membrane adhesion. Furthermore, a high concentration of tetracycline was found in the compartment that rapidly equilibrated with the medium, most probably the periplasm, of Tet-containing E. coli cells, and the level of tetracycline accumulation in Tet-containing cells was not diminished by the mutational loss of the OmpF porin. These results suggest that the Tet protein, in contrast to the endogenous efflux system(s), pumps magnesium-chelated tetracycline into the periplasm. A quantitative model of tetracycline fluxes in E. coli cells of various types is presented.
