Due to advances in chemotherapy, differentiation therapy and bone marrow transplantation (BMT), adult acute myeloid leukemia (AML) has become a curable disease, and we are making further efforts to heighten the cure rate. The JALSG AML 89 study resulted in a 77% complete remission (CR) rate in 326 adults with AML, and a 38% 4.5-year disease-free survival (DFS) in CR cases. The JALSG AML92 study for APL with all-trans retinoic acid resulted in a 89% CR rate in 196 and 64% 4-year DFS in CR cases.
