We studied the antibacterial effect of Hinokitiol against Staphylococcus aureus. As reference, we studied also the antibacterial effects of the oil and water from Thujopsis dolablata var. hondai Makino which contains Hinokitiol an important element of its antibacterial effect. Interestingly, Hinokitiol showed the double zone phenomenon, i.e., minimum inhibitory concentration of hinokitiol against MSSA was 15-125 micrograms/ml and against MSSA was 125 micrograms/ml. But when the concentration of Hinokitiol was diluted to 1.87-0.94 micrograms/ml, then the growth of MSSA was inhibited (Table 1 and Fig. 1). This phenomenon was observed the study on antibacterial effect using disk containing Hinokitiol (Fig/3). Similar phenomenon were observed also in the study using water from Thujopsis dolablata (Table 2 & Fig. 2). We deduce that Hinokitiol has a strong antibacterial effect against S. aureus. But this effect shows double zone effect. The antibacterial effect of Hinokitiol is more prominent against MRSA than MSSA.
