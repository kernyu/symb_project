The present study describes the comparative efficacy of chloroquine and amodiaquine in two different presumptive therapy areas of north eastern India. The study recorded insignificant differences in respect of Mean Parasite Clearance Time (MPCT) of sensitive cases, MPCT and Mean Parasite Recrudescence Time (MPRT) of RI resistant cases and recrudescence rate in chloroquine and amodiaquine therapy areas. It is concluded that amodiaquine is not a superior drug as compared to chloroquine. In the chloroquine resistance area, Plasmodium falciparum developed cross resistance to amodiaquine and this phenomenon appears to be unidirectional. However, amodiaquine may help to slow-down the rate of precipitation of higher grade of resistance.
