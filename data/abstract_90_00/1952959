Cytocidal effects of combined use of BH-AC and nitrosourea derivatives (MCNU, and ACNU) were evaluated in vitro against adriamycin-resistant human leukemia cell line (K-562/ADR-I). K-562/ADR-I cells were resistant to six kinds of agents (vindesine, mitoxantrone, aclacinomycin, cisplatin, MCNU, and BH-AC) of 14 agents tested and this cell line proved to be a multi-drug resistant line. Combined use of BH-AC and MCNU did not achieve additive effects on K-562, parent cell line and BH-AC and MCNU were less effective to K-562/ADR-I by single use. However, combination of BH-AC and MCNU showed additive effects. These results supported the evidence that combination of BH-AC with MCNU was effective in patients with multi-drug resistant malignant lymphomas.
