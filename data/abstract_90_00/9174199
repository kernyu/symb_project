We evaluated the bactericidal activity of RP 59500 (quinupristin-dalfopristin) against fibrin-platelet clots (FPC) infected with two clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, one constitutively erythromycin and methicillin resistant (S. aureus AW7) and one erythromycin and methicillin susceptible (S. aureus 1199), in an in vitro pharmacodynamic infection model. RP 59500 was administered by continuous infusion (peak steady-state concentration of 6 microg/ml) or intermittent infusion (simulated regimens of 7.5 mg/kg of body weight every 6 h (q6h) q8h, and q12h. FPCs were infected with S. aureus to achieve an initial bacterial density of 10(9) CFU/g. Model experiments were run in duplicate over 72 h. Two FPCs were removed from each model at 0, 12, 24, 36, 48, and 72 h, and the bacterial densities (in CFU per gram) were determined and compared to those of growth control experiments. Additional samples were also removed from the model over the 72-h period for pharmacokinetic evaluation. All regimens significantly (P < or = 0.01) decreased bacterial densities in the infected FPCs for both isolates compared to growth controls. This occurred even though MBCs were equal to or greater than the RP 59500 concentrations achieved in the models. There were no significant differences found between the dosing frequencies and levels of killing when examining each isolate separately. However, examination of the residual bacterial densities (CFU per gram at 72 h) and visual inspection of the overall killing effect (killing curve plots over 72 h) clearly demonstrated a more favorable bactericidal activity against 1199 than against the AW7 isolate. This was most apparent when the q8h and the q12h AW7 regimens were compared to all 1199 treatment regimens by measuring the 72-h bacterial densities (P < or = 0.01). Killing (99.9%) was not achieved against the AW7 isolate. However, a 99.9% kill was demonstrated for all dosing regimens against the 1199 isolate. The area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 24 h was found to be significantly correlated with reduction in bacterial density for the AW7 isolate (r = 0.74, P = 0.04). No resistance was detected during any experiment for either isolate. RP 59500 efficacy against constitutively erythromycin- and methicillin-resistant S. aureus may be improved by increasing organism exposure to RP 59500 as a function of dosing frequency.
