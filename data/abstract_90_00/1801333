One hundred and thirteen children aged 12 years or less with cerebral malaria in Accra, Ghana were treated with chloroquine either with a low dose regime of 3.5 mg/kg 8-hourly intramuscularly, or orally by nasogastric tube, in a standard regime, both to a total of 25 mg/kg body weight. There was no obvious difference in outcome in the 2 treatment groups. The overall mortality of 5.3% (5.9% and 4.4% in the oral and intramuscular treatment groups respectively) was similar to that seen 10 years ago in this hospital. The average parasite clearance time had increased to 61 h, compared to 41 h noted 10 years ago. The incidence of hypoglycaemia (3%) was very low compared to studies in other malaria endemic areas. The reason for this is not clear but it could have contributed to the low mortality. Neurological deficits were seen on day 14 in 7.8% of patients. Parasitaemia recurred within 14 d in 22% of surviving patients, confirming the presence of RI/RII chloroquine resistance in Accra.
