Mechanically ventilated patients are at a substantially higher risk for developing nosocomial pneumonia. Overall, there is a relatively constant 1&!TN!150;3% risk per day of developing pneumonia while receiving mechanical ventilation. The sensitivity and specificity of clinical criteria alone for diagnosis of ventilator-associated pneumonias (VAP) is low. Several techniques have been developed to sample and quantitate the lower respiratory tract to improve the diagnostic yield. Gram-negative bacillary pneumonias account for the majority of the VAP. Strategies for prevention of VAP such as use of sucralfate for stress ulcer prophylaxis and selective decontamination of the digestive tract have been the focus of many clinical studies. Cost-effective preventive measures are needed to combat the increasing antimicrobial resistance, growing population of immunocompromised patients and increasing number of mechanically ventilated patients.
