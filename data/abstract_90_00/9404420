Vascular hypertrophy may increase the blood pressure by its effect on vascular resistance. In this study, adenoviral gene transfer of IFN-beta was analysed in a porcine model of balloon injury to determine whether a secreted growth inhibitory protein might affect the regrowth of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) in vitro and in arteries. An adenoviral vector encoding IFN-beta (ADV-IFN-beta) was constructed by homologous recombination between sub360 genomic DNA, an ADV 5 derivative with a deletion in the E3 region and a porcine IFN-beta expression plasmid. Its antiproliferative effect was analysed using cell proliferation assays, and used in a porcine model of balloon injury. After injury, arteries were immediately transfected with 7 x 10(9) plaques forming units of either ADV-IFN-beta or a control E1A deficient adenovirus that does not encode a recombinant protein, ADV-delta E1. The intima/media (I/M) area ratio was determined by quantitative morphometry 21 days after artery injury and gene transfer. Expression of recombinant porcine IFN-beta in VSMC reduced cell proliferation significantly in vitro, and supernatants derived from IFN-beta vector infected cells inhibited VSMC proliferation relative to controls. When introduced into porcine arteries after balloon injury, a reduction in I/M ratio of 30% was found. I/M ratio in the IFN-beta transduced arteries was 0.54 +/- 0.03 vs 0.69 +/- 0.06 in ADV-delta E1 transfected arteries and 0.702 +/- 0.05 in the non-transfected arteries. Gene transfer of an adenoviral vector encoding IFN-beta to VSMC and injured arteries reduced cell proliferation and vascular thickening. This approach is potentially applicable to vascular proliferative diseases.
