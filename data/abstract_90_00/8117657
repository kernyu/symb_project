The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) protease is a homodimeric aspartyl endopeptidase that is required for virus replication. A number of specific, active-site inhibitors for this enzyme have been described. Many of the inhibitors exhibit significant differences in activity against the HIV-1 and HIV type 2 (HIV-2) enzymes. An initial study was conducted to ascertain the HIV-1 protease's potential to lose sensitivity to several test inhibitors while retaining full enzymatic activity. The substrate binding sites of the HIV-1 and HIV-2 enzymes are almost fully conserved, except for four amino acid residues at positions 32, 47, 76, and 82. Accordingly, recombinant mutant type 1 proteases were constructed that contained the cognate type 2 residue at each of these four positions. The substitution at position 32 resulted in a significant adverse effect on inhibitor potency. However, this substitution also mediated a noted increase in the Km of the substrate. Individual substitutions at the remaining three positions, as well as a combination of all four substitutions, had very little effect on enzyme activity or inhibitor susceptibility. Hence, the four studied active site residues are insufficient to be responsible for differences in inhibitor sensitivity between the HIV-1 and HIV-2 proteases and are unlikely to contribute to the generation of inhibitor-resistant mutant HIV-1 protease.
