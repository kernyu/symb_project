Helminth infection, species diversity (proportion of each species in the community), species number, intensity of infection and anthelmintic resistance were investigated in 16 dairy-goat farms of south-western France. The aim of the study was to estimate which breeding management factors may affect diversity and intensity of infection. Anthelmintic resistance was investigated because this factor may modify composition of nematode communities. Farm history and breeding management were recorded by means of a questionnaire. Natural and experimental infections were compared to determine which strategy was the best to estimate diversity index and number of species from nematode community of a whole herd. A total of 17 species of helminths, among which 14 nematodes, one cestode (Moniezia spp.) and two trematodes (Paramphistomum daubneyi and Dicrocoelium lanceolatum) were recovered in the 26 necropsied culled goats. One culled goat worm burden represented conveniently species number but not species diversity (Shannon index) of parasite community harboured in the whole herd. Experimental sheep infection with larvae from pooled faeces of 15 goats was the best strategy to estimate species diversity in farms. Diversity could be predicted from the number of farms from which goats originated at constitution of the herd, the duration of goat winter withdrawal from pastures, and intensity of infection. Anthelmintic resistance was correlated with the number of farms of origin, area of permanent pastures and intensity of infection. The strategy adopted for the herd constitution was a critical step as species diversity and risk of anthelmintic resistance increased with the number of farms of origin. Intensity of infection was negatively correlated with species diversity. This suggested that more diverse communities were better controlled by the host, in agreement with the widespread statement that diversity would beget stability.
