In Kaposi's sarcoma tissue, prostaglandin E2 (PgE2) levels and cAMP phosphodiesterase levels were found to be higher than in surrounding normal tissue. We have shown earlier that PgE2 suppresses interferon (IFN) alpha production. High levels of cAMP phosphodiesterases result in low cAMP levels. Thus, this phenomenon may be involved in altered immunologic resistance, growth and differentiation.
