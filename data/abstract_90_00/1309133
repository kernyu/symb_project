During 1967 to 1985, three cases of listeriosis were reported in Algeria; at that time Listeria monocytogenes caused several thousand cases of meningitis and sepsis in the world. In order to determine the frequency and bacteriologic characteristics of strain isolated in Algeria, a prospective investigation was carried from 1985 to 1989 in humans and animals samples. Sensitivity tests to antibiotics (MIC) point out that all isolates strains are resistant to cephalosporins (first and third generation), but are susceptible to Ampicillin and Gentamicin which ought to constitute the treatment basis of listeriosis.
