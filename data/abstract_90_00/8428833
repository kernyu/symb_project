The prophylactic administration of injectable tilmicosin for pneumonia in weaned beef calves was investigated in 1,806 animals. Comparisons were made among calves receiving an "on-arrival" injection of tilmicosin, calves receiving a single injection of long-acting oxytetracycline, and calves receiving no prophylaxis. Morbidity and mortality attributable to pneumonia, morbidity and mortality attributable to all causes, and case fatality were significantly lower in the group of calves that received tilmicosin, compared with calves that received long-acting oxytetracycline and calves that received no prophylactic antibiotic. Mean time to initial pneumonia treatment was significantly extended in calves that received prophylaxis, compared with those that received no antibiotic on arrival at the feedlot. Calves that received tilmicosin gained significantly more weight than calves that received oxytetracycline. Calves that were not treated for pneumonia during the trial period gained significantly more weight than did those calves that were treated for pneumonia regardless of experimental group. The majority of mortalities were attributable to fibrinous pneumonia (31/34). Important bacterial isolates (Pasteurella spp, Haemophilus somnus, Actinomyces pyogenes) obtained at necropsy did not have resistance to tilmicosin in association with administration of tilmicosin as prophylaxis for pneumonia. However, bacterial resistance to trimethoprim/sulfonamide and to oxytetracycline were commonly found in these postmortem isolates.
