Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is one of the most important microorganisms in nosocomial infection. The Hospital staff working in MRSA endemic wards are known to have MRSA in their nasal cavity. The nasal carriage of MRSA was detected in staff members and patients of two hospitals. In Niigata University Hospital, 10 out of 109 nurses and 8 out of 142 doctors were found to be MRSA carriers. On the other hand, in Nagaoka Red Cross Hospital, 25 out of 448 nurses were found to be MRSA carriers, however, no carrier was found in 23 doctors. These strains were also resistant to MCIPC, IPM, TFLX and OFLX, whereas they remained sensitive to VCM. The coagulase types of MRSA isolated from the hospital staff and patients were II, IV and VII, although those of Methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA) consisted of all types. Elimination of nasal MRSA from the carriers was considered for avoiding hospital outbreaks caused by this potential pathogen. Forty hospital staff and 19 patients, in who's MRSA was found persisting in their nasal cavity, were treated by povidone iodine and chloramphenicol (CP) MRSA disappeared in 44% and 84% of the nasal carriers by povidone iodine and CP, respectively.
