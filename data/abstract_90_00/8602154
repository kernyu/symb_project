Genetic analysis of the progeny of crosses involving strains of the moss Physcomitrella patens obtained by re-transforming a stable transgenic line, indicates that the plasmid used for re-transformation inserts at or near the chromosomal location of the related plasmid used to obtain the original transgenic line. The resulting structure may be subject to gene silencing.
