The schizogonic rhythm of rodent malarias in the blood of mice varies from one species or subspecies to the other. Synchronous strains enable a precise study of the sensitive stage of the parasite to antimalarial drugs. Asynchronous strains are less sensitive than synchronous strains because of the delayed penetration of merozoites into red blood cells.
