A United Kingdom national survey of clinical isolates and their antimicrobial susceptibility was performed, with 61 participating hospital laboratories, between 1986 and 1989. Each centre used Microbe Base, a commercial suite of micro-computer programs which can record and analyse antimicrobial susceptibility data Informative on 366,853 bacterial isolates and their antimicrobial susceptibility was received from hospital and domiciliary specimens; Candida spp. accounted for a further 9121 isolates. The sites of origin were urine 51%, skin and soft tissue 21%, lower respiratory tract 8%, genital tract 7%, ear, nose and throat 6%, eye 3%, blood 1.5% and faeces 1%. Gram-negative bacteria accounted for 242,307 isolates, the main species were Escherichia coli 48%, Proteus spp. 9%, Pseudomonas spp. 7%, Haemophilus influenzae 6% and Klebsiella spp. 4%. Gram-positive bacteria numbered 124,546 with a predominance of Staphylococcus aureus 42%, beta-haemolytic streptococci 20%, Enterococcus spp. 12%, coagulase negative staphylococci 10% and Streptococcus pneumoniae 5%. All pneumococci were sensitive to penicillin, and methicillin resistant in Staph. aureus was only 2%. Twelve per cent of H. influenzae strains were resistant to ampicillin. There were no significant levels of gentamicin resistance in Gram-negative bacilli.
