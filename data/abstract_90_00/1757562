The Vitek GPS-TA card (Vitek Systems, Hazelwood, Mo.) was compared with single-concentration broth microdilution and disk diffusion methods using high-content disks for the detection of high-level resistance to gentamicin and streptomycin in 99 isolates of enterococci (81 Enterococcus faecalis isolates and 18 Enterococcus faecium isolates). The GPS-TA card accurately detected high-level resistance to gentamicin, but not streptomycin, in E. faecalis. When streptomycin is being considered for therapy, either disk diffusion or time-kill studies should be used to confirm susceptible results obtained by Vitek testing. Additional studies are needed to determine the best method for testing E. faecium isolates.
