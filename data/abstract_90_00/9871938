Antibacterial activity of ofloxacin in urine after a single oral dose of 400 mg was evaluated in ten healthy female volunteers. Urine was collected over six periods, i.e., 0-6 h, 6-12 h, 12-24 h, 24-48 h, 48-72 h, and 72-96 h postdose. Ofloxacin levels were assayed in all samples using a microbiological method and HPLC. Urinary ofloxacin MICs were determined for five bacterial strains recovered from urine, two E. coli strains of which one was susceptible and the other resistant to nalidixic acid (Nal-A), one Klebsiella pneumoniae resistant to nalidixic acid (Nal-B), one Staphylococcus saprophyticus strain, and one Enterococcus faecalis strain; MICs were 0.06, 0.25, 1, 0.25, and 2 mg/L, respectively. Mean urinary ofloxacin levels by the microbiological method during the six collection periods were 193.3 +/- 30.3, 138.1 +/- 31, 53.2 +/- 7.3, 8.3 +/- 0.8, 1.4 +/- 0.2, and 0.6 +/- 0.1 mg/L, respectively. HPLC provided similar results: 216.7 +/- 31.6, 130.7 +/- 20.5, 56.5 +/- 7.1, 8.3 +/- 0.9, 1.5 +/- 0.3, and 0.5 +/- 0.05 mg/L, respectively. Mean urinary ofloxacin excretion over 96 h was 67.4 +/- 3.6% of the dose by the microbiological method was 72.5 +/- 2.5% of the dose by HPLC. On the first day, bacteriostatic activity of urine against enterobacteria exceeded 32 and was greater than 8192 for the nalidixic acid-susceptible E. coli strain; on the next day, overall values were equal or greater than 8 for the nalidixic acid-resistant E. coli and K. pneumoniae strains. Bacteriostatic activity was equal to or greater than 32 for the S. saprophyticus strain during the first two days and equal to 8 on the first day and 4 on the second day for the E. faecalis strain.
