Problems of bacterial resistance and a desire to improve the pharmacological properties of antimicrobial agents will cause the development of a number of new antimicrobial agents in the next few years. Currently there are new beta-lactamase inhibitor, macrolides, oral cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones, dual-action cephalosporin-quinolones, and glycopeptides in the initial stages of clinical development. These agents will not completely replace the older agents, but will provide the physician with even greater flexibility when dealing with complicated infections, when switching from parenteral to oral therapy, and when resistance is a problem.
