Spleen and peritoneal macrophages obtained from innately resistant A/J mice released low levels of interleukin 18 (IL-18) upon infection with Salmonella typhimurium C5 RP4. Incubating the cells with recombinant gamma interferon (rIFN-gamma) enhanced IL-18 production. A/J mice treated in vivo with anti-IL-18 antibodies showed impaired resistance to infection, with increased bacterial loads in the liver and spleen. Administration of rIL-18 could protect A/J mice from challenge with a lethal dose of virulent salmonellae, with a dramatic reduction in bacterial numbers in the tissues. rIL-18 administration did not ameliorate the disease in IFN-gamma-R-/- mice. IL-18 proved to be required for IFN-gamma production by mouse splenocytes from conventional, scid, and rag-1(-/-) mice; in vivo IL-18 neutralization caused a decrease in circulating IFN-gamma levels. Thus, IL-18 is a key factor in early host resistance to Salmonella and probably acts via IFN-gamma.
