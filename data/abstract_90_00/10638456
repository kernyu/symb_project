We carried out clinical and bacteriological studies on clavulanic acid/amoxicillin and amoxicillin in pediatric acute otitis media at 14 general practice settings. The results are summarized as follows. 1. The major isolated organisms from content of middle ear effusion were Streptococcus pneumoniae 31.8%, Haemophilus influenzae 35.8% and Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis 1.5%. Similar results were observed for the major isolates organisms from content of nasopharynx Streptococcus pneumoniae 31.1%, Haemophilus influenzae 33.9% and Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis 19.2%. 2. 42.2% of S. pneumoniae isolated from middle ear effusion were drug resistant S. pneumoniae (PISP, PRSP) and they were increasing year by year. 3. 46.7% of S. pneumoniae isolated from nasopharyngeal swab were drug resistant S. pneumoniae (PISP, PRSP) and they were increasing year by year. The incidence of drug resistant S. pneumoniae isolated from all cases and organisms were 26.3% and 14.5%, respectively. 4. On MIC90, antimicrobial activity of CVA/AMPC against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis was superior to SBTPC. 5. In the evaluation of clinical efficacy, bacteriological efficacy and utility, CVA/AMPC-treated group was significantly superior to AMPC-treated group. 6. Adverse reactions were observed in 22% of CVA/AMPC-treated group, involving diarrhea and loose stool.
