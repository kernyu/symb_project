INTRODUCTION: Mycobacterium chelonae is an ubiquitous mycobacterium which is exceptionally pathogenic. It can cause localized skin infections which are difficult to treat because of multiple drug-resistance. CASE REPORT: A 87-year-old woman with bullous pemphigoid was treated with long-term prednisone and developed a skin infection due to M. Chelonae. Treatment with clarithromycin was successful, but relapse occurred 6 months after withdrawal of the antibiotic. DISCUSSION: Clarithromycin is effective in single drug regimen for M. Chelonae infection, but the duration of treatment should be long when immunosuppression cannot be avoided.
