Seven wild populations of Blattella germanica (L.) originating from five regions and two populations Periplaneta americana (L.) from two regions of the country were tested for susceptibility to dichlorvos. A standard method recommended by WHO was used. The results obtained showed resistance in German cockroach populations from four regions with resistance index 5.3x ... 31.1x at LT50 and 6.1x ... 39.8x at LT90. Three percentage resistant nymphs of P. americana from Sofia city have been established.
