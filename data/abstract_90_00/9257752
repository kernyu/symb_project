Protegrin-1 (PG-1) is a cysteine-rich, 18-residue beta-sheet peptide isolated from porcine leukocytes with antimicrobial activity against a broad range of microorganisms. The MICs of PG-1 against representative gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria ranged from 0.12 to 2 microg/ml. At these levels, PG-1 was rapidly bactericidal in vitro, reducing the number of viable CFU of either methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) or Pseudomonas aeruginosa by more than three log units in less than 15 min. Resistance to PG-1 did not develop after 11 subculturings of P. aeruginosa or 18 subcultures of MRSA in Mueller-Hinton broth containing PG-1 at one-half the MIC. Under similar conditions of serial passage, the MICs of norfloxacin and gentamicin against P. aeruginosa increased 10 and 190 times, respectively. Similarly, the MIC of norfloxacin against MRSA increased 85 times. Immunocompetent mice inoculated intraperitoneally (i.p.) with P. aeruginosa or S. aureus exhibited 93 to 100% mortality in the vehicle control group compared with 0 to 27% mortality in animals that received a single i.p. injection of PG-1 (0.5 mg/kg of body weight). Mice inoculated with S. aureus by intravenous (i.v.) injection and dosed 0 to 60 min later with a single i.v. injection of PG-1 (5 mg/kg) had a mortality of 7 to 33%, compared to a mortality of 73 to 93% in the vehicle controls. In leukopenic mice inoculated i.v. with vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium, mortality was 87% in the vehicle control group and 33% in animals that received a single i.v. injection of PG-1 (2.5 mg/kg). Taken together, these data indicate that PG-1 has potential for use as an antimicrobial agent in the treatment of local or systemic infections caused by clinically relevant pathogens.
