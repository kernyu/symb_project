This study aimed to investigate the physical properties of a porcine internal thoracic artery fixed with an epoxy compound. Fresh and glutaraldehyde-fixed porcine arteries were used as controls. Both the epoxy-fixed and glutaraldehyde-fixed porcine arteries showed significant increases in fixation index and denaturation temperature as compared to the fresh one. Additionally, the resistance of porcine arteries against bacterial collagenase in vitro degradation increased significantly after cross-linking with the epoxy compound of glutaraldehyde. The reduction of the tensile strength of the epoxy-fixed artery after bacterial collagenase degradation was more severe than in its glutaraldehyde-fixed counterpart. Generally, with increasing pH, temperature or fixative concentration, the fixation indices and denaturation temperatures of the epoxy-fixed porcine arteries increased. The results obtained in this study may be used to optimize the fixation process for developing a small-diameter biological vascular graft fixed by an epoxy compound.
