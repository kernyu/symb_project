Abamectin is a novel, highly promising insecticide with activity against many pests. To determine if resistance to abamectin could occur, we collected house flies from several New York dairies and selected them in the laboratory. Resistance developed rapidly and to a high level (36 or greater than 60,000-fold, depending upon test technique and/or adjuvant) that could not be overcome by the synergists piperonyl butoxide or S,S,S-tributylphosphorotrithioate. There was no increase in (cross)resistance to crotoxyphos, dichlorvos, dimethoate, tetrachlorvinphos, permethrin, dieldrin or lindane following abamectin selection. Our results suggest the potential for abamectin resistance is high, at least in house flies, and that the judicious use of abamectin will be needed to prolong its usefulness as an insecticide.
