OBJECTIVE: To study the antimicrobial resistance of surgical isolates in Wuhan area. METHOD: The diameters of the inhibition zones of surgical isolates around antibiotic susceptibility test discs at 13 hospitals in Wuhan were computerfiled and analysed by the software of "WHONET-3" according to NCCLS published in 1993. RESULT: A total of 957 surgical isolates were collected in 1996. S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, E. coli and CNS were the main microorganisms. 12.4% of S. aureus was resistant to oxacillin and to other antimicrobials as well. Most strains of Enterobacteriaceae were resistant to ampicillin, with a resistant rate of more than 75%, but 93% for klebsiella sp. Imipenem, ceftazidime, amikacin and ciprofloxacin were most active agents against Gram (-) bacilli including Enterobacteriaceae and glucose nonfermenters. CONCLUSION: Antimicrobial resistance should be seriously considered during surgical therapy and prophylaxis with antimicrobial agents. The tendency to antimicrobial resistance of clinical isolates should be followed up continuously.
