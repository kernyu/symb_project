The prevalence of Staphylococcus species and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in human saliva and on denture surfaces was examined with selective media. A total of 166 saliva samples from dental students and individuals using dentures and 39 swab samples from denture surfaces were subjected in this study. The detected percentage of MRSA from saliva samples was 2.3%. Five out of 39 swab samples of denture surface contained MRSA or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE). The isolated MRSA and MRSE were resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics.
