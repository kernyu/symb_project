BALB/c mice are highly susceptible to Leishmania major infection. The susceptibility increases progressively with the age of the mice. Aged mice produce progressively lower levels of interleukin-2 (IL-2) and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) but higher levels of IL-4 compared to younger mice. Thymopentin, a pentapeptide with thymopoietin activity, dramatically increases the resistance to Leishmania major infection in aged mice. The thymopentin-treated mice produce enhanced levels of IL-2 and IFN-gamma, but significantly reduced amounts of IL-4. Thus, it appears that the age-related susceptibility to cutaneous leishmaniasis is correlated with the enhancement of Th2 and the reduction of Th1 cell activities. Furthermore, thymic hormone may play an important role in the induction and function of these two subsets of CD4 T cells.
