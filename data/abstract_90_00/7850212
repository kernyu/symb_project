Many antibiotics exert their effects by interfering with protein synthesis. Studies of the molecular mechanisms of antibiotic resistance in clinical strains of mycobacteria have revealed mutations in ribosomal RNAs. This type of acquired resistance was previously unknown in bacterial pathogens and was made possible because mycobacteria have only a single set of rRNA genes.
