The beta-lactamases produced by Acinetobacter lwoffii ULA-501, Acinetobacter baumannii ULA-187, and A. baumannii AC-14 strains were purified and characterized, and their kinetic interactions with several beta-lactam molecules, including substrates and inhibitors, were studied in detail. The three enzymes appeared to be cephalosporinases with different acylation efficiencies (kcat/Km ratio values), and their hydrolytic activities were inhibited by benzylpenicillin, piperacillin, and cefotaxime, which did not behave as substrates. Carbenicillin was a substrate for the beta-lactamase from A. lwoffii ULA-501, whereas it acted as a transient inactivator of the enzymes produced by the two A. baumannii strains. Clavulanic acid was unable to inactivate the three beta-lactamases, whereas sulbactam behaved as an inactivator only at a high concentration (1 mM) which is difficult to achieve during antibiotic therapy. Analysis of the interaction with 6-beta-iodopenicillanic acid also allowed us to better discriminate the three beta-lactamases analyzed in the present study, which can be included in the group 1 functional class (5).
