The checkerboard titration method was used to test the synergy of cefpirome and cefotaxime with teicoplanin or vancomycin against 35 penicillin-susceptible, 34 penicillin-intermediate, and 31 penicillin-resistant pneumococci. The MICs at which 50 and 90% of isolates are inhibited (MIC50s and MIC90s, respectively) of both cefpirome and cefotaxime were 0.016 and 0.06 microgram/ml, respectively, for penicillin-susceptible strains and 0.125 and 0.5 microgram/ml, respectively, for penicillin-intermediate strains. The MIC50s and MIC90s of cefotaxime for penicillin-resistant strains were 1.0 and 2.0 micrograms/ml, respectively, and those of cefpirome were 0.5 and 1.0 microgram/ml, respectively. All pneumococci were inhibited by cefpirome at MICs of < or = 1.0 microgram/ml. The MIC50s and MIC90s of vancomycin and teicoplanin (0.25 and 0.25 microgram/ml and 0.03 and 0.03 microgram/ml, respectively) did not differ for the three groups. Checkerboard synergy studies showed that cefpirome and vancomycin showed synergy for 31 strains (fractional inhibitory concentration [FIC] indices, < or = 0.5) cefpirome and teicoplanin showed synergy for 18 strains, cefotaxime and vancomycin showed synergy for 51 strains, and cefotaxime and teicoplanin showed synergy for 27 strains. Cefpirome and vancomycin had FIC indices indicating indifference (2.0) for two strains, and cefotaxime and vancomycin had FIC indices indicating indifference for one strain. All other FIC indices indicating indifference or additivity were > 0.5 to 1.0. No FIC indices indicating antagonism (> 4.0) were found. Synergy between beta-lactams and glycopeptides for three susceptible, three intermediate, and three resistant strains were tested by the time-kill assay, and all combinations were synergistic by this method. Synergy between cephalosporins and glycopeptides can be demonstrated and may be useful for the treatment of pneumococcal infections, especially meningitis.
