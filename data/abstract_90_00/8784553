Fifty-one Staphylococcus aureus strains lacking mec for which oxacillin MICs were 1 to 8 micrograms/ml were tested against oxacillin and the combination of oxacillin and clavulanic acid with the Vitek GPS-SA card, the reference broth microdilution method, and the oxacillin agar screen plate. Of the 51 strains, 44 (86%) did not grow on the oxacillin agar screen plate, broth microdilution MICs were 1 to 2 micrograms/ml, and GPS-SA card MICs were < or = 2 micrograms/ml, with the exception of 3 strains that failed to grow in the card on repeated attempts. Another seven strains did grow on the oxacillin agar screen plate. For four of the latter group of strains, oxacillin broth microdilution MICs were > 4 micrograms/ml and GPS-SA card MICs were > or = 4 micrograms/ml; for the other 3 strains, corresponding MICs were 4 and < or = 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. The GPS-SA card classified 86% of strains as oxacillin susceptible.
