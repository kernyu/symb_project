BACKGROUND: Streptococcal pharyngitis, caused by group A beta-hemolytic streptococci (GABHS), is among the most common infections seen by primary care physicians. Because the illness can result in rheumatic fever, early eradication of infection is important. Penicillin has been the standard treatment for GABHS pharyngitis for over four decades, but reports of bacteriologic failure with this drug in recent years have led to trials of alternative antimicrobials. METHODS: In this investigator-blind, randomized multicenter trial (30 centers), oral clarithromycin, 250 mg twice daily, or oral penicillin VK, 250 mg three times daily, was given to outpatients > or = 12 years old with GABHS pharyngitis as documented by positive cultures for Streptococcus pyogenes and positive rapid immunoassay tests. The clinical and bacteriologic efficacy of clarithromycin was compared with that of penicillin in the 356 evaluable patients. Safety analysis was performed in all patients who had received at least one dose of the study drug (N = 453). RESULTS: Overall, clinical outcomes were comparable in the two groups. However, more clarithromycin-treated patients than penicillin-treated patients had resolution of sore throat (94% vs 86%, P = .014) and disappearance of pharyngeal erythema and exudate (89% vs 82%, P = .05). Bacteriologic cure rates were higher in clarithromycin-treated patients (95% vs 87%, P = .009). No serious adverse events were observed in either group. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that clarithromycin twice daily is as effective and as well tolerated as penicillin in the treatment of streptococcal pharyngitis.
