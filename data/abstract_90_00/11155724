INJECTABLE SPECTROGRAMIN: Combination regimens using quinupristin/dafopristin with either gentamicin or vancomycin have powerful bactericidal activities (even against quinupristin-resistant strains) against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in a model of experimental endocarditis in the rabbit. In clinical trials, quinupristin/dalfopristin is becoming a therapeutic alternative to consider after failure of conventional antistaphylococcal treatments. NEW GENERATION CEPHALOSPORINS: These new cephalosporins, particularly C-3 pyridinium-thiomethyl-cephalosporins, new (3-dithiocarbamoyl) cephalosporins, and a series of new compounds with high affinity for MRSA PLP2a, are particularly active against MRSA and are unaffected by beta-lactamases. A NEW CARBAPENEM: This new antibiotic has a wide bactericidal effect against Gram-positive organisms and is active against MRSA as well as penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae. NEW FLUOROQUINOLONE DERIVATIVES: In vitro, these new derivatives have been found to be active against MRSA, pneumococci non-sensitive to ciprofloxacin, and Bacteroides fragilis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Chlamydia pneumoniae.
