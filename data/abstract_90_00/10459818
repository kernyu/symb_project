The antibiotic resistance patterns of gram-negative bacteria isolated from nursing home patients between 1983 and 1997 were analysed. Escherichia coli was the most prevalent isolate (48%) followed by Proteus spp. (26%) and other Enterobacteriaceae (20%). During the study period, the susceptibility of E. coli decreased for co-trimoxazole (79% to 62%), increased for nitrofurantoin (79% to 91%) and remained unchanged for amoxycillin (41%). Susceptibility to norfloxacin, available from 1990, decreased from 87% to 71%. Similar trends were observed when the susceptibilities of all gram-negative urinary pathogens were combined. The changes in susceptibility can probably be attributed to the empirical prescribing practices in the nursing homes studied.
