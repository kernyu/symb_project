A total of 374 Staphylococcus aureus and 126 Staphylococcus epidermidis strains from 14 countries were studied for their resistance to methicillin, trimethoprim (Tp) and sulfonamides (Su), alone and combined (TpSu). The frequency of resistance to Tp, Su and TpSu was much higher in methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis (MRSE) than in methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). Considerable differences, however, existed in isolates from different countries. Resistance to Tp, Su or TpSu in MRSA was low or absent in isolates from Switzerland, Spain, Japan, Mexico, Argentina and Chile, but high in isolates from Germany and Brazil. High level Tp resistance mostly resided on large plasmids. It could be transferred in 17 out of 97 strains. Su resistance was never cotransferred. Strains cured of their large Tp resistance plasmids remained Su-resistant, which suggests a chromosomal location of Su resistance.
