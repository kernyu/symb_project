OBJECTIVE: To establish the surveillance system for drug resistance of tuberculosis according to WHO and IUATLD guidelines, and to evaluate the initial and acquired drug resistance in Shandong province. METHODS: 30 of 141 counties/cities were randomly selected as surveillance points by cluster sampling from April to October 1997, in each of which 36 cases with smear positive pulmonary tuberculosis were continuously observed. Identification and susceptibility tests were done in all culture positive samples. RESULTS: The total frequency of drug resistance was 23.4%, initial drug resistance 17.6%, initial multi-drug resistance 2.9%, acquired drug resistance 50.0%, acquired multi-drug resistance 19.6%. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that the initial drug resistance still ranks high in Shandong province, National TB Control Program should be further strengthened.
