We describe a case of bacterial endocarditis caused by Enterococcus faecalis, which was highly resistant to aminoglycosides. The patient was successfully treated with a combination of ampicillin, imipenem and vancomycin. We believe this to be the first case in the literature to be treated successfully with this combination.
