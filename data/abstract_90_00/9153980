BACKGROUND: The emergence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and its multidrug-resistant property has led to the search for an effective antibiotic to combat staphylococcal sepsis. At present, vancomycin remains the most effective antibiotic. This study evaluated the in vitro efficacy of netilmicin (an aminoglycoside) and compared its activity with 4 other antibiotics, viz. vancomycin, amikacin, tobramycin and ofloxacin. METHODS: The minimum inhibitory concentration of the antibiotics was determined by the agar dilution method. Thirty strains each of methicillin-resistant and -susceptible S. aureus isolated from pus and blood cultures were included. RESULTS: The susceptibility to netilmicin was found to be 100% and was the same as that observed for vancomycin. CONCLUSION: All the methicillin-resistant S. aureus strains tested showed 100% susceptibility to netilmicin, suggesting its use in patients with such infections as an alternative to vancomycin. However, this finding needs to be verified in the clinical setting.
