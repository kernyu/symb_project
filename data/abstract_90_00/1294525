Bacteriuria in pregnancy occurs in about one in 20 pregnant women and is usually initially asymptomatic. It is an important marker for acute symptomatic infection (often pyelonephritis) later in pregnancy, which occurs in about one in four bacteriurics. Several considerations surround the antibiotic treatment of the asymptomatic infection; these include a low frequency of in vitro resistance to the agent used, lack of toxicity to the foetus, a low incidence of gastrointestinal side effects, good compliance and proven efficacy. Fosfomycin trometamol seems to fit these requirements. In three controlled studies (two multicentric) 250 patients were treated with fosfomycin trometamol in a 3 g (as fosfomycin) single dose; 197 patients were given one of three other agents. Cure rates for fosfomycin trometamol were 77-94% (68-94% for other agents), which was satisfactory in an infection which is sometimes difficult to eradicate. Further studies are needed in this important but accessible group of patients. Opportunities should be taken to study more foetal outcomes and provide more data on gastro-intestinal tolerability.
