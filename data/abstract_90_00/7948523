Following neurosurgery necessitated by intractable seizures, Enterococcus faecium meningitis that was resistant to ampicillin, a high-level aminoglycoside (MIC, > 2,000 micrograms/mL), and vancomycin developed in a 6-year-old boy. Treatment with intrathecal teicoplanin in combination with intravenous clindamycin, rifampin, and ampicillin was successful. The role of intravenous and intrathecal antibiotics in treatment of this infection is discussed. This case is illustrative of the safety and potential usefulness of intrathecally administered teicoplanin.
