The influence of nigericin (nandavir) on the organism producing it (Streptomyces hygroscopicus 155) was studied with respect to the synthesis of protein, RNA and DNA. The resistance of the mycelium of different ages to the exogenic antibiotic was investigated. Exogenic nigericin had a more marked inhibitory effect on the macromolecular synthesis in a nonproductive variant of the strain. The antibiotic sensitivity of the mycelium in both the variants (productive and nonproductive) depended on the culture age. It was suggested that there were not less than two mechanisms of the protection from the own antibiotic in the organism.
