N,N-dimethylglycylamido (DMG) derivatives of 6-demethyl-6-deoxytetracycline and doxycycline bind 5-fold more effectively than tetracycline to the tetracycline high-affinity binding site on the Escherichia coli 70S ribosome, which correlates with a 10-fold increase in potency for inhibition of E. coli cell-free translation. The potencies of DMG-doxycycline and DMG-6-demethyl-6-deoxytetracycline were unaffected by the ribosomal tetracycline resistance factors Tet(M) and Tet(O) in cell-free translation assays and whole-cell bioassays with a conditional Tet(M)-producing E. coli strain.
