Analysis of deduced amino acid sequences has demonstrated that the sequences of eukaryotic and prokaryotic proteins mediating resistance to antibiotics and antiseptics are highly related. Hydropathy analysis and alignment of conserved motifs revealed that these proteins can be divided into two separate families with either 12 or 14 transmembrane segments (TMS). Conserved motifs have been identified which are either characteristic for each family or conserved in both families. The conservation of these motifs suggested that they may be essential for the function of these proteins. Phylogenetic and structural analysis revealed that the two families may have evolved from a common ancestor with six TMS.
