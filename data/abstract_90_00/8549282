Diarrhoea and typhoid fever are two important diseases in the developing world, particularly the Asian countries. The management of these conditions is becoming increasingly difficult in the face of emerging pathogen resistance. The new fluoroquinolones demonstrate good in vitro activity against the causative pathogens involved, including those that are multidrug resistant. These agents have been shown to be very effective in the treatment of diarrhoea and typhoid in clinical trials, achieving results equal to, or better than, standard drugs. Importantly, fluoroquinolones also considerably shorten the duration of illness, thereby offering rapid relief to the patient.
