BACKGROUND: From European and North American data, it is recommended in the Asia Pacific consensus statement, that one week therapy with a proton pump inhibitor, amoxycillin and clarithromycin be used for Helicobacter pylori eradication, in areas of high metronidazole resistance. The efficacy of this regimen is unknown in Singapore. AIM: To assess the efficacy, safety and compliance of an H. pylori eradication regimen and examine clinical factors that potentially determine eradication. METHODS: Consecutive outpatients from a multicultural, south east Asian, population with H. pylori infection, with or without peptic ulcer, were treated with lansoprazole 30 mg, amoxycillin 1 gm, clarithromycin 500 mg, twice a day for seven days. Eradication was assessed by either rapid urease, histology or urea breath test. Compliance and side effects were recorded. The eradication rate and effect of ethnicity, age, sex, usage of alcohol, smoking and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, history of ulcer and endoscopic diagnosis on eradication were examined by univariate and multivariate analysis. RESULTS: Of 113 patients, the eradication rate by intention to treat was 98/113 (87%) (95% confidence interval [CI] 80-93%) and per protocol was 98/106 (92%) (95% CI 87-97%). Using Fisher's exact test, eradication was more successful in Chinese (intention to treat and per protocol respectively p=0.02 and p<0.001) compared to non-Chinese. By logistic regression analysis ethnicity was an independent factor associated with eradication success (p=0.0025). Side effects occurred in five (4.4%), resulting in cessation of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: This one week eradication regimen is safe and effective in south east Asians. Chinese ethnicity may be associated with a higher likelihood of eradication success.
