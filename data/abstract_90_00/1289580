Cefprozil (CFPZ, BMY-28100), a new oral cephalosporin, was evaluated for its efficacy and safety in 42 children with bacterial infections (Table 1), and the following results were obtained. 1. CFPZ was administered in 3 or 4 divided doses at daily dosages ranging from 15.3 to 60.0 mg/kg to 42 patients (19 cases of acute tonsillitis and/or laryngitis, pharyngitis, 13 cases of pneumonia, 2 cases each of suppurative cervical lymphadenitis and UTI, and 1 case each of scarlet fever, acute otitis media, suppurative parotitis, impetigo contagiosa, furuncle and acute enteritis) and the following clinical results were obtained: excellent; 24 cases, good; 14 cases, fair; 4 cases. The overall efficacy rate was 90.5% (Table 3). 2. MICs of CFPZ against 50 strains of isolated organisms are shown in Table 4. In 19 cases out of 28 cases examined, causative organisms were successfully eradicated and strain of Staphylococcus aureus was decreased in 1 case. 3. Diarrhea was observed in 2 cases (cases 8, 11). In case 8, the symptom disappeared spontaneously. Case 11 improved immediately after the administration of the drug was stopped. Among 39 children who went through laboratory tests, eosinophilia which seemed to be related to the administration of this drug was observed in 2 cases (cases 29, 38). Slight elevations of S-GOT and S-GPT were found in 1 case (case 22) (Table 7). 4. These data suggest that CFPZ is a safe and useful new antibiotic in the treatment of children with susceptible bacterial infections.
