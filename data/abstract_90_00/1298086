Artemether has the potential to be an alternative antimalarial for multiple drug resistant falciparum malaria. However, it has been associated with high recrudescent rates which may be due to incorrect dosage regimens. The dosage regimens are varied from country to contry. We have carried out a comparative study of two dosage regimens, ie 480 mg and 600 mg total dose given over 5 days in uncomplicated and severe falciparum malaria. 167 patients were included in the study, 61 with acute uncomplicated falciparum malaria and 106 with severe malaria. All patients showed a good initial response. The difference in total dose had no effect on the parasite or fever clearance time (PCT or FCT). However, the severity of the disease did have some influence of these times. The PCT and FCT from either regimen of uncomplicated malaria were significantly faster than those of severe malaria (p < 0.005 and = 0.05, respectively). The cure rate seems to have some correlation with the amount of drug given and severity of the disease. The cure rates in uncomplicated malaria were 84 and 92%, respectively, for 480 mg and 600 mg. In severe malaria the cure rates dropped to 65 and 76%, respectively, for 480 and 600 mg. We conclude that artemether can be considered as an alternative antimalarial for multiple drug resistant falciparum malaria. However, the cure rate of severe falciparum malaria in this study is not considered satisfactory in areas with multiple drug resistant falciparum malaria. Further studies are needed to assess the curative efficacy with different dosage regimens.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
