BACKGROUND: Bcl-xL is the predominant anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member in the liver. Suppression of cell death promotes carcinogenesis and contributes to resistance to radiation and chemotherapeutic agents. METHODS: Direct effects of Bcl-xL protein on apoptosis and necrosis were investigated in rat hepatoma cells. Rat hepatoma cell line McA-RH8994 cells were transfected with expression plasmids containing a whole coding sequence of rat bcl-xL cDNA of sense orientation. Stable transfectant cell lines expressing bcl-xL cDNA (designated as RH8994/Bcl-xL-S), or control plasmid DNA (designated as RH8994/pT) were established. RESULTS: Cellular amounts of Bcl-xL in RH8994/Bcl-xL-S cells were demonstrated to be more than 20-fold that of RH8994/pT and parental cells. Three independent clones of RH8994/Bcl-xL-S were isolated and their susceptibility to various cell death stimuli was compared with that of the control cells. Transforming growth factor-beta1 and tumour necrosis factor-alpha induced apoptosis dose dependently in these cells, but the 50% cytotoxicity concentrations of these factors in RH8994/Bcl-xL-S cells were more than 10-fold higher than those in RH8994/pT and parental cells. Similarly, RH8994/Bcl-xL-S cells were shown to be significantly less susceptible to necrotic cell death induced by a calcium ionophore, A23187; a mutagen, N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine; and UV-irradiation when compared with the control cells. CONCLUSIONS: Over-expression of Bcl-xL was shown to provide protection against apoptotic and necrotic cell death in rat hepatoma cells.
