The ID90 or ID50 values of acyclovir for the herpes simplex virus strains isolated in VGH-Taipei were determined by plaque reduction method. Twenty HSV isolates of 1980's (1980-1985) and thirty of 1990's (1990-1995) were subjected to plaque reduction assay for susceptibility test to acyclovir. There were fifteen HSV isolates of 1990's whose ID90 were higher than those of 1980's, indicating a trend of more acyclovir resistant isolates in 1990's.
