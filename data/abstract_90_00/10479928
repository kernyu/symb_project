The results of determination of drug medium depend on both individual cultural properties of the strains tested and the type of the medium used. The composition of a medium is of significance for some strains: the latter grow in any medium and are characterized by the same spectrum of resistance. However, most drug-resistant strains have higher feeding demands which are not fully met on the lyophilized Lowenstein-Jensen medium. The strains in the lyophilized medium show an incomplete spectrum of resistance and less grow than do those in freshly prepared Lowenstein-Yersen medium.
