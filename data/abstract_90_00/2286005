To compare the efficacy and side-effects of two therapeutic regimens for chloroquine-resistant falciparum malaria, a randomized study was carried out in 69 patients in Maputo Central Hospital in 1986-1987. The two treatments were sulfadoxine 25 mg/kg + pyrimethamine 1.25 mg/kg as a single dose (S + P) and amodiaquine 10 + 10 + 5 mg/kg over three days with sulfadoxine + pyrimethamine on the third day (A + S + P). The cure rate was 25/29 (86%) with S + P and 27/30 (90%) with A + S + P. No serious side-effects were observed. The probably slightly higher cure rate with the triple combination is hardly of clinical importance in semi-immune patients, but may theoretically help retard the development of resistance to sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine. This point and the question of the incidence of side-effects with the two regimens should be made the object of an epidemiological study.
