The prevalence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains in Trinidad and the extent of their resistance to other antimicrobial agents in hospital-acquired and community-acquired infections were evaluated over a 2-year period. A total of 450 S. aureus strains were isolated from different patients. The prevalence of methicillin resistance among S. aureus strains was 9.8% (44/450). The proportion of MRSA isolated from hospital sources and community sources was 12.5% (38/305) and 4.1% (6/145), respectively (P < 0.05). The resistant rates of MRSA to the non-beta-lactam antibiotics were as follows: 93.2% resistance to tetracycline, 68.2% to erythromycin, 61.4% to gentamicin, 45.5% to co-trimoxazole, and 20.5% to ciprofloxacin. No MRSA resistant to vancomycin was observed in this study. Study results showed significant increases in MRSA in hospital, 2% in 1995 to 12.5% in 1998 (P < 0.05), and community, 0% in 1995 to 4.1% in 1998 (P < 0.05). It has become apparent that infection control and surveillance initiatives must be focused now on the community in order to monitor and limit the spread of this new and expanding reservoir of MRSA.
