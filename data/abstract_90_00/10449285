OBJECTIVES: In order to evaluate the role played by cytokine profile as a co-factor involved in the resistance to HIV infection in couples serodiscordant for HIV, we studied HIV-seronegative subjects with multiple unprotected sexual exposures. DESIGN AND METHODS: Twenty-one HIV-exposed seronegative subjects (HEPS), their 21 HIV-seropositive partners and 10 HIV-seronegative unexposed individuals were studied for T helper (Th) types 1-2 cell pattern and CCR5 receptor. RESULTS: Twelve out of 21 HIV-seropositive partners of HEPS showed a CD4 cell count below 200 lymphocytes/microl. HIV strains were isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in 17 patients (81%): seven subjects with syncytium-inducing strains and 10 with non-syncytium-inducing isolates. Low Th1 cytokine production and high levels of IL-4 were detected in HIV-seropositive subjects. A significant reduction of IL-2 and IFN-gamma expression in the CD4 and CD8 cells of HEPS was found compared with HIV-seronegative unexposed individuals. Similar levels of low IL-4 were present in both HEPS and controls. The partial deletion of a single allele (wild type/delta32) of CCR5 was found in only one HEPS. CONCLUSION: The downregulated Th1 profile we observed in HEPS could be related to a cellular anergy state with a protective role in the transmission rate of HIV. Low levels of IL-2 and IFN-gamma could be involved in a low-grade activation state of CD4 lymphocytes. A decrease of IFN-gamma levels could render macrophage cells incapable of antigen presentation, thus resulting in a reduction of the cell-to-cell spread of infection.
