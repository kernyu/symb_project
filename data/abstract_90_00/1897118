Four populations of Trypanosoma congolense and Trypanosoma brucei brucei were isolated from cattle under different management practices and environments in Zambia. All four isolates had varied responses to both diminazene aceturate (Berenil) and isometamidium chloride (Samorin) as curative drugs in infected mice. Trypanosomes from a traditionally managed herd in a high-tsetse-challenge area had the strains most resistant to Berenil, with maximum curative dose of 45 mg kg-1 body weight. Another isolate from a high-tsetse-challenge area was evidently resistant both to Berenil at 40 mg kg-1 and to Samorin at 4 mg kg-1. The strains most susceptible to both Berenil and Samorin were from a commercially managed herd of cattle under medium tsetse challenge. They responded to recommended cattle standard doses of 3.5 mg kg-1 or 7 mg kg-1 Berenil and to as little as 0.25 mg kg-1 Samorin. It is evident that trypanosome strains resistant to Berenil and/or partially resistant to Samorin exist, and that both T. congolense and T. b. brucei are implicated.
