The results of our experiment in vitro showed that the activity of standard RNA polymerase decreased while the concentration of RFD and RFP increased, indicating that the target site of action of RFD was similar to that of RFP on RNA polymerase. Incorporation of [3H] UR into the RNA of sensitive cells of S. sureus and E. coli was strongly inhibited by RFD, but RFD did not affect the resistant strains. In purified DNA-dependent RNA polymerase of sensitive and resistant strains, the enzyme activity of sensitive E. coli a S. aureus strains was inhibited by RFD, but RFD did not inhibit that of the resistant strains (except the P. vulgaris). It can be concluded that a decreased susceptibility of RNA polymerase to RFD as well as a decreased permeability of bacterial envelope may induce bacterial resistance to the drug.
