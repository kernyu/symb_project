The aim of our study was to recognize coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) in the air of operating theatres. Out of the identification of 449 isolates, the most frequent species were Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus haemolyticus. The strains were adherent to glass in 52.3%. Most of the S. epidermidis showed adherent growth, while the majority of the S. haemolyticus failed to adhere. The disk-diffusion antibiotic sensitivity tests showed great differences in sensitivity to penicillin, tetracycline and erythromycin between adherence-positive and negative isolates. On the whole, the species S. haemolyticus proved to be much more resistant than S. epidermidis. Staphylococcus warneri was the most, while S. haemolyticus was the least sensitive to phages.
