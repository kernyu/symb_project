A multidrug resistance gene, YDR1, of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which encodes a 170-kDa protein of a member of the ABC superfamily, was identified. Disruption of YDR1 resulted in hypersensitivity to cycloheximide, cerulenin, compactin, staurosporine and fluphenazine, indicating that YDR1 is an important determinant of cross resistance to apparently-unrelated drugs. The Ydr1 protein bears the highest similarity to the S. cerevisiae Snq2 protein required for resistance to the mutagen 4-NQO. The drug-specificity analysis of YDR1 and SNQ2 by gene disruption, and its phenotypic suppression by the overexpressed genes, revealed overlapping, yet distinct, specificities. YDR1 was responsible for cycloheximide, cerulenin and compactin resistance, whereas, SNQ2 was responsible for 4-NQO resistance. The two genes had overlapping specificities toward staurosporine and fluphenazine. The transcription of YDR1 and SNQ2 was induced by various drugs, both relevant and irrelevant to the resistance caused by the gene, suggesting that drug specificity can be mainly attributed to the functional difference of the putative transporters. The transcription of these genes was also increased by heat shock. The yeast drug-resistance system provides a novel model for mammalian multidrug resistance.
