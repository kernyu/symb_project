BACKGROUND: Omeprazole enhances the efficacy of bismuth-based triple therapy. It is unknown whether the same is true for other proton pump inhibitors. Lansoprazole has superior anti-Helicobacter activity in vitro and possibly also in vivo; therefore we investigated quadruple therapy with lansoprazole. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In two studies performed in separate hospitals, a total of 67 Helicobacter pylori-positive patients were treated with 7-day quadruple therapy (lansoprazole, colloidal bismuth subcitrate, tetracycline, and metronidazole) after 3 days of lansoprazole pretreatment. Testing for cure was done by endoscopy in study 1 and by breath test in study 2. RESULTS: Cure rates per protocol were 31 of 31 (100%) in study 1 and 30 of 32 (94%) in study 2. Intention-to-treat cure rates were 31 of 35 (89%) in study 1 and 30 of 32 (94%) in study 2. Cured overall were 32 of 34 with a metronidazole sensitive strain and 3 of 3 with a metronidazole-resistant strain. Data on side effects were collected from 51 patients. Twelve (21%) had no side effects, 27 (53%) had mild side effects, 10 (20%) had moderate side effects, but only 2 (4%) had severe side effects. Side effects, never were the reason that a patient stopped taking the medication. CONCLUSIONS: The results with lansoprazole-quadruple therapy are comparable to the historic control group treated with omeprazole-quadruple therapy. The cure rare is very high, and although mild to moderate side effects occurred in many patients, everybody finished the treatment regime.
