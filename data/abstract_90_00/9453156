Insertional mutagenesis of cloned genes coupled with site specific recombination into the genome of the parent organism is an ideal method for characterizing gene function. In this paper we describe the production and utility of two antibiotic resistance cassettes for use in Haemophilus influenzae. The mutagenic elements encode resistance to chloramphenicol or spectinomycin. Multiple paired restriction enzyme sites bound both cassettes. Use of these constructs to create mutants in H. influenzae demonstrated that the cassettes are readily incorporated into the genome in single copy and allow easy detection of mutant constructs. The insertions are stable following repeated in vitro passage. In addition, the elements are compatible with each other and allow the construction of multiple mutations within a single strain.
