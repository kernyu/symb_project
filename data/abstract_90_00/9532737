We have examined the expression of CDR1 (Candida drug resistance gene) in different stress conditions. There was a significant but transient enhancement of CDR1 expression associated with elevated temperatures. Most noteworthy transcriptional activation was observed with miconazole and vinblastine. Interestingly, beta-estradiol and progesterone were also able to enhance CDR1 expression. Elevated levels of CDR1 and CDR2 (a homologue of CDR1) mRNA were found in some azole-resistant clinical isolates of C. albicans. CaMDR1 (benomyl-resistant) expression, however, did not differ among all the resistant isolates. Our results confirm the existence of multiple mechanisms of azole resistance in C. albicans.
