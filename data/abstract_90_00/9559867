The present experiments were done to elucidate the roles of thioredoxin and thioredoxin reductase system in defense against hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in Escherichia coli. The thioredoxin-deficient mutant (trxA) was more sensitive to H2O2 than was the wild-type strain, when challenged in the stationary and exponentially growing phase. Thioredoxin reductase-deficient mutant (trxB) in the stationary phase also exhibited increased sensitivity, compared with the wild-type strain. These results indicated that reduced form of thioredoxin is required for defense against H2O2, possibly by scavenging radicals generated in the cells. In contrast, the trxB mutant in the growing phase had higher survival after exposure to H2O2 than the wild-type strain. The acquirement of resistance related to increased capacity for removing H2O2 in the trxB mutant and was not observed in a catalase-negative background. Furthermore, enhanced expression of the katG :: lacZ gene occurred in the mutant. Therefore, it was concluded that oxidized form of thioredoxin confers H2O2 resistance on E. coli cells by increasing activity to remove H2O2, which was brought about by enhanced induction of the katG-coded catalase/hydroperoxidase I at the transcriptional level. In addition, this resistance to H2O2 correlated well with reduced amount of DNA damage caused by H2O2, determined by the induction level of the recA :: lacZ fusion gene after treatment with H2O2.
