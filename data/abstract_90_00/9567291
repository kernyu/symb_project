Coimmobilization of proteolytic and bacteriolytic enzymes on a carboxyl-containing grafted cellulose copolymer was studied. The resistance of lysozyme to gamma-sterilization significantly increased after coimmobilization with a proteolytic enzyme. The resulting material accelerated the cleansing of wounds.
