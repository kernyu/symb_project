A Neurospora crassa mutation, mei-2, affecting recombination and pairing of homologous chromosomes during meiosis, was characterized for its effect on repeat-induced point mutation (RIP). We found that RIP, which depends on recognition of DNA sequence homology, is not inhibited by mei-2, suggesting that the defect in chromosome pairing of this mutant is not due to a defect in DNA pairing and that DNA pairing is not dependent on chromosome pairing.
