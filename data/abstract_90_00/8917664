Spontaneous and methyl methanesulfonate-induced trifluorothymidine-resistant mutants in mouse lymphoma L5178Y cells were analyzed using fluorescence in situ hybridization with mouse probes specific for chromosome 11, on which the tk gene is located, and chromosome 3, as the control. 76.5% (13/17) of small-colony mutants (thought to be the result of chromosomal mutation) and 28.6% (4/14) of large-colony mutants (thought to be the result of gene mutation) showed rearranged chromosome 11. Of the mutants with abnormal chromosome 11 painting pattern, 5 small- and 2 large-colony mutants carried clonal aberrations, while the remaining 8 small- and 2 large-colony mutants showed mosaic aberrations. Most abnormalities in the small-colony mutants involved the distal region of one painted chromosome 11, where the tk+ gene maps. An increase, rather than a decrease, in chromosome 11 material was found in a majority of abnormally painted mutants. On the contrary, no rearrangements involving chromosome 3 were found in any small- and large-colony mutants analyzed except one large-colony mutant, which showed chromosome rearrangements involving both chromosome 11 and 3. The present study confirms that the majority of small-colony mutants in L5178Y cells have chromosome 11 rearrangements that can be detected by chromosome painting and that the majority of the chromosomal abnormalities in TFT-resistant mutants involved complex rearrangements.
