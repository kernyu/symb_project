Though with the advent of more and more numbers of antibiotics, infection control has become easier but it has been established more resistant strains of microbes are appearing. These resistant strains are becoming major public health problem. Drug misuse is one of the factors for resistant strains. While discussing mechanisms of drug resistance, gene transfer plays an important part. Drug resistance can be prevented by taking several strategies. There are several methods for performing antibiotic sensitivity test e.g., diffusion methods and dilution methods which are discussed elaborately.
