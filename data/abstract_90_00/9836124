We have developed a new method of detecting clinical S. aureus strains possessing heterogeneous resistance to vancomycin (hetero-VRSA). The method exploits characteristic antagonism between vancomycin and beta-lactam antibiotics against the strain Mu3, a representative hetero-VRSA. The method comprises of the following procedures: 1) overnight culture of bacteria is streaked on brain heart infusion agar containing 4 micrograms/ml of vancomycin, 2) paper discs impregnated with any one of beta-lactam antibiotics are placed onto the plate, and 3) the plate is incubated at 37 degrees C and the cell growth was observed after 24 h and 48 h of incubation. The Mu3 cells were grown only around the beta-lactam discs due to the antagonism between vancomycin and beta-lactam against Mu3 cells. A total of 321 MRSA clinical strains isolated in 1995 and 1996 from 12 medical facilities in Japan were tested with this method. A total of 39 strains (12.1%; 24 h) and 67 strains (20.96%; 48 h) grew around the beta-lactam discs. All the 10 strains (representing 10 facilities), tested with the analysis of resistant subpopulations to vancomycin, showed similar heterogeneous patterns as observed with Mu3. The method was considered as a convenient and rapid substitute for the population analysis, the authentic method for the detection of hetero-VRSA strains.
