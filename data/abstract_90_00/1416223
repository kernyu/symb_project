The in-vivo-test of Plasmodium drug resistance is one of the essential basic controls, assisting therapeutic measures in tropical malaria. An initial in-vitro-check up of drugs provided for antimalarial therapy is another useful help to the clinician. Even when manufactured WHO test kits are not available, the analysis of drug resistance can be performed under simple working conditions. Its application is demonstrated in a patients history.
