Recently, the frequency of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection has been increasing. We experienced a case of postoperative enterocolitis due to MRSA. The patient was an 81-year-old male with benign prostatic hypertrophy. Urine leakage from the penrose drain tube appeared 1 day after suprapubic prostatectomy. We had used intravenous infusion of antibiotic agents including cefodizine (CDZM), imipenem (IPM/CS) and cefmetazol (CMZ). He developed severe diarrhea, high fever, oliguria, leg edema and ascites 24 days after the operation. MRSA was detected from his feces. Toxic shock syndrome toxin-I (TSST-I) was produced by this bacteria the coagulase type of which was type II. The patient was treated with oral vancomycin (1 g/day), to which this bacteria showed sensitivity and the patient showed, improvement, including symptoms, leucocytosis and serum CRP level 12 days after administration of vancomycin.
