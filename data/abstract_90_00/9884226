The cry-b sequence, encoding a basic elicitin (cryptogein B) from Phytophthora cryptogea, was co-transformed into Phytophthora infestans. The copy number of the cry-b sequence varied in co-transformants. Nevertheless, in all cases the alien elicitin gene was transcribed, translated and the protein secreted in vitro from such transformants. Moreover, the secreted cryptogein B from P. infestans co-transformants increased their ability to cause a hypersensitive-response-like necrosis of tobacco leaves. It was thus concluded that the transfer of a single gene encoding a basic elicitin from one Phytophthora species to another can dramatically alter the phenotypic interaction of the transformed species with tobacco.
