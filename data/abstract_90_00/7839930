Hydrophobicity generally increased as the cells passed from lag to exponential phases of growth and declined in the stationary phase. All concentrations of ampicillin used increased hydrophobicity, although still subject to effect of phase of growth. Chloramphenicol caused decline in hydrophobicity. Combination of the two antibiotics gave a concentration dependent balance of the two forces observed. Protein synthesis inhibition may render cells resistant to phagocytic uptake by lowering surface hydrophobicity. This phenomenon is probably involved in cases of therapeutic failures, persistent of recurrent infections. This is a further indication of the undesirability of antibiotic abuse.
