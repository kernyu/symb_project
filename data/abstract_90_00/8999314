Study of the biosynthesis of human alpha 2-interferon and tumor necrosis factor in derivatives of E. coli SG200-50 recipient strain containing pIF16, pTNF311, and pLT21 plasmids demonstrated elimination of the plasmids from the cells without degradation thereof in the course of culturing. Methods increasing the content of the end products in the biomass are proposed.
