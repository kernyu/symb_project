A microbiological assay method for measurement of T-3761 and its stability in body fluids were investigated. The paper disc method proved suitable for this assay using Escherichia coli Kp as a test organism and commercially available heart infusion agar as a test medium. When using the paper disc method, lower detection limit of T-3761 was approximately 0.05 microgram/ml and 0.1 microgram/ml for 1/15M phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) and human serum, respectively. T-3761 in human serum and urine was stable under freezing -20 degrees C for at least 28 days.
