History, signs and symptoms, chemoprophylaxis and management of 150 malaria patients hospitalized at the University Hospital and St. Clara Hospital (Claraspital) of Basel, Switzerland, were analyzed from 1970 to 1992. Mainly due to increasing travel in endemic areas, an increase from 3.2 cases per year for the years 1970 to 1981 to 9.5 cases per year for the years 1982 to 1992 occurred. In the latest period, more patients had to be admitted to the intensive care unit (14.0% from 1970 to 1986, 28.1% from 1987 to 1992). Infections with plasmodium falciparum were more frequent in later years, the incidence of plasmodium vivax and non-typifiable plasmodia decreased. Compliance for chemoprophylaxis was insufficient, with only 21.8% of all patients taking a correct prophylaxis in the latest period. Malaria is a significant health problem in industrialized countries like Switzerland with increasing incidence and worsening course due to the development of drug resistance.
