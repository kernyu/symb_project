Striking structural analogies exist between the two specific antimycobacterial drugs ethionamide (ETH) and isoniazid (INH), and they share several inhibitory properties in susceptible species of mycobacteria. The effect of ETH on mycolic acid synthesis was studied in whole cells and in cell extracts of various species, since this synthesis is one direct target for INH, as we recently demonstrated in cell extracts of Mycobacterium aurum. It was shown in the present study that there is not a direct relationship between ETH susceptibility and mycolic acid inhibition. This observation could explain the lack of cross-resistance between the two drugs. The presence of ETH disturbed mycolic acid synthesis in both resistant and susceptible mycobacteria. Synthesis of oxygenated species of mycolic acid was inhibited, while that of diunsaturated acids was either slightly altered or even increased. In contrast, INH inhibited the synthesis of all kinds of mycolic acids in the same way in all susceptible strains and had no effect on mycolic acid synthesis in resistant strains. In the presence of ETH, the unsaturated mycolic acid molecules presented a methyl end different from the usual one. These data strongly suggest that the normal unsaturated mycolic acid species are not the precursors of the oxygenated types. Moreover, they show that ETH probably acts early in the pathway leading to oxygenated mycolic acid.
