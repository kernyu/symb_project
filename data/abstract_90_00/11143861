During the end of September 1997, an unusual outbreak of severe dehydrating watery diarrhoea cases and deaths were reported from Malda town. Vibrio cholerae 01 El tor, the causative agent responsible for this episode was isolated from 56.5% of cases sampled. Three of the five drinking water samples were also positive for V cholerae 01. Majority of cases were adults. Isolated strains were uniformly resistant to furazolidone and intermediately to norfloxacin. Indiscriminate use of antibiotic should be discouraged for development of multidrug resistant strains.
