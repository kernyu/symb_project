Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has been recognized as a nosocomial pathogen in Europe and North America for almost 3 decades. More recently it has emerged as a problem in long-term care facilities. However, It has been less frequently considered a pathogen in community-acquired infections, where it is most often seen in intravenous drug users. Consequently there has been very few studies, particularly in Bangladesh, documenting incidence of ciprofloxacin-resistance among MRSA in community patients. We tested clinical isolates from outdoor patients for ciprofloxacin resistance among MRSA strains, using in vitro susceptibility tests by standard disk diffusion technique. Results show significantly high incidence of ciprofloxacin resistance among MRSA isolates in these patients.
