The ermC gene confers resistance to MLS antibiotics in a Bacillus subtilis host. Synthesis of the ermC gene product, a ribosomal RNA methylase, is inducible by the addition of subinhibitory concentrations of erythromycin. Regulation of ermC gene expression occurs at the post-transcriptional level in three ways: translational attenuation, translational autoregulation, and messenger RNA stabilization.
