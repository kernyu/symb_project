Pseudomonas aeruginosa Nos. 1 and 5, each co-existing growth-inhibitor-producing and -nonproducing cells, were used in this study. An equal number of both cells (each 10(8) CFU/mouse) was challenged intraperitoneally to mice, and these cells in the heart blood and kidneys of mice were determined. Furthermore, the effect of piperacillin, ceftazidime and sisomicin on the cell distribution in mice was studied in the model infection due to P. aeruginosa Nos. 1 and 5. As a control experiment both cells of P. aeruginosa No. 1 were each challenged intraperitoneally at a dose of 10(8) CFU/mouse to mice of two groups, but there were no marked differences between the two types in cell counts of the heart blood or kidneys 9 hours after challenge. When a concomitant challenge of both cells (each 10(8) CFU/mouse) was performed in mice, the number of growth-inhibitor-producing cells of the heart blood and kidneys was about 100 times greater than that of the non-producing cells. These in vivo results were well comparable to the previous in vitro results and indicated that the inhibitor affected the invasion of the non-producing bacteria in the body in the model infection due to P. aeruginosa isolates consisting of the two types of cells. Similar results were obtained in mice with the model infection due to P. aeruginosa No. 5. Anti-pseudomonal drugs such as piperacillin (50 mg/mouse) and ceftazidime (50 mg/mouse) and sisomicin (1 mg/mouse) were given intramuscularly to mice infected concomitantly with both cells of P. aeruginosa No. 1.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
