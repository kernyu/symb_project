Ninety Enterobacter cloacae strains isolated from 12 Greek hospitals were examined in terms of epidemiological types and resistance mechanisms. Using O serotyping 69% of the strains were assigned to a specific serotype and overall 16 different serotypes were identified. The combination of serotyping, phagetyping and biotyping efficiently discriminated most of the strains, indicating that single epidemic strains were not prevalent, although serotypes 3, 7, and group II predominated. Eight representative strains, all resistant to gentamicin, tobramycin, amikacin and netilmicin, were further examined for transferability and mechanisms of resistance. Aminoglycoside resistance was found to be transferable in most strains, and 13 R plasmids of 40-120 MDa molecular weight were detected. The enzymes detected consisted of three enzymes active against gentamicin [ANT(2h'), AAC(3)-I and AAC(3)-V]; three active against tobramycin [ANT(2"), AAC(3)-V and AAC(6')-I]; two active against netilmicin [AAC(3)-V and AAC(6')-I]; and one active against amikacin [AAC(6')-I]. APH(3') and ANT (3"), which modify neomycin and streptomycin plus spectinomycin respectively, were also found. Overall up to five aminoglycoside modifying enzymes were detected on the same R plasmid, AAC(6')-I plus ANT(2") being the most prevalent. The high incidence of multiresistance in Enterobacter cloacae and the fact that resistance is due to enzymatic inactivation of the antibiotics, indicate that in Greece this species might act as a gene pool for the spread of resistance to other bacteria of clinical relevance.
