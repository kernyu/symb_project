Albendazole, oxfendazole, fenbendazole, levamisole, closantel, ivermectin and febantel were administered to sheep on four farms and their efficacy assessed by faecal egg count reduction test. High level of resistance of Haemonchus contortus was found to benzimidazoles (albendazole, oxfendazole, fenbendazole) on all farms and to febantel on the one farm where it was tested. No resistance to closantel and levamisole was observed. Resistance to ivermectin was absent on the three farms examined under this study, but has been reported on the fourth farm in earlier work. It is concluded that anthelmintic resistance to benzimidazoles and the probenzimidazole, febantel, is a serious and widespread problem in H. contortus in sheep in Malaysia.
