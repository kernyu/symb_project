Members of the family Enterobacteriaceae harboring an enzyme of the aminoglycoside acetyltransferase 3 class (AAC-3-IV) (apramycin and gentamicin resistance) and hygromycin B phosphotransferase 4 (HPH-4-I) (hygromycin B resistance) have been isolated from human clinical sources in Europe. A cluster of genes containing IS140, aacC4, and hphB was found in these strains. We demonstrate by Southern hybridization that this cluster is identical to the operon found in animals that also contains insertion sequences belonging to the ISO family. This provides another example of presumptive transfer of antibiotic resistance genes between bacteria of animal and human origin.
