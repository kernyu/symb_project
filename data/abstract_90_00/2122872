We have generated transgenic mouse lines expressing the proto-oncogene c-fos under the control of the interferon inducible Mx promotor. We found low expression in skeletal muscle, brain and salivary glands and a very high expression in spleen, liver, thymus, heart and kidney. Despite this transgenic c-fos expression we have not yet detected any phenotypic changes in these mouse lines.
