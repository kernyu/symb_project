We have amplified the previously cloned and sequenced genes of the bacitracin exporter (bcr), a member of the ATP-binding transport protein family, within the chromosome of the bacitracin producing Bacillus licheniformis. Amplification of the transporter genes was followed by greatly increased bacitracin resistance. Antibiotic production was enhanced at a low level of bcr genes amplification. An enlarged increase in the copy number of the bcr genes negatively affects the overall growth of bacteria.
