An application of encapsulated lipase to the hydrolysis of triacetin (triglyceride of acetic acid) was carried out with a continuous stirred tank reactor, in which the encapsulated enzyme was dispersed. An automatic control device to control pH of the reaction mixture at a desired level was designed and installed in the reactor system. Conversion of triacetin at the steady state operation with pH controlled became significantly higher than that without pH control. A particular kinetic model proposed by the authors, which regarded the mass-transfer through the wall of microcapsules as a dominant resistance to the overall reaction rate, was also applicable to simulate the behaviour of CSTR system as in the case of packed-bed reactor.
