The potential of the riminophenazine agents clofazimine and B669, at therapeutically relevant concentrations, to reverse P-glycoprotein-mediated multidrug-resistance (MDR) in a human lung cancer cell line (H69/LX4) has been investigated in vitro. Cyclosporin A, a well-documented MDR-modifying agent, was included for comparison. Clofazimine, B669 and cyclosporin A at minimally cytotoxic concentrations of 1, 0.5 and 5 micrograms/ml, respectively, were equally effective in restoring sensitivity to vinblastine, doxorubicin, daunorubicin and mitomycin C in the H69/LX4 cell line. All three chemosensitizing agents also increased the accumulation of [14C]vinblastine by H69/LX4 cells. Riminophenazines, which are relatively non-toxic, non-carcinogenic and non-myelosuppressive agents, are promising contenders for evaluation in experimental and clinical oncology as modulators of acquired MDR.
