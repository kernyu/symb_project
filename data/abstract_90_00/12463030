In order to document the evolution of the chemoresistance of Plasmodium falciparum to chloroquine in Madagascar, a study was carried out in Sainte-Marie island located at 6 km on the eastern border of the country. Symptomatic malaria patients who satisfied criteria for resistance testing, were recruited by a process of passive case detection at two clinics. These patients were enrolled in a sensitivity 14-day in vivo test for uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria attacks. All subjects received a supervised therapeutic regimen of chloroquine (25 mg base/kg over 3 days). Parasitemia and symptoms were monitored for 14 days. 62 (93.9%) out of the 66 enrolled patients completed the 14-day follow-up. A total of 50 of 62 patients (80.6%) presented an adequate clinical response. Early and late treatment failures were observed in 3 (4.8%) and 9 (14.5%) patients respectively. Failure therapeutic treatments treated with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine were successful. Chloroquine remains effective in the treatment of malaria due to P. falciparum and therefore its choice as a first line drug remains justified. Likewise, guidelines for the use of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine as second line drug are adequate. In vitro, 4 resistances out of 27 successful tests to chloroquine (14.8%) and 1 resistance out of 25 successful tests to mefloquine (4%) were recorded. No resistance to quinine nor to amodiaquine were noticed. Alternative antimalarial drugs such as quinine, amodiaquine or mefloquine can be used in patients for whom the treatment with chloroquine is not possible. Nevertheless, the level of therapeutic failures to chloroquine detected in this study highlights the need and importance of drug sensitivity test for the development of a rational national antimalarial drug policy.
