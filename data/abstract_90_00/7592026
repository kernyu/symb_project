The ability of strains of Bacillus, Staphylococcus, Pseudomonas, and Escherichia coli to inactivate rifampicin was tested. Most Bacillus strains were found to inactivate rifampicin. Two modes of inactivation were identified; one was phosphorylation and the other involved decolorization. Presence or absence of either mechanism appeared unrelated to the phylogenetic relatedness of strains. None of the other organisms could inactivate this antibiotic.
