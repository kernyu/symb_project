Among 209 isolates of aminoglycoside resistant Enterobacteriaceae isolated from patients attending the Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital in Perth, Western Australia between January 1985 and June 1991, 41 strains demonstrated additional resistance to cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, ceftazidime and aztreonam. Significant synergy was demonstrable between these beta-lactams and clavulanic acid against resistant strains. The beta-lactamase was mediated by a 170 Kb self-transferring plasmid and identified as the SHV-5 type in isoelectric focusing (pl 8.2) and substrate hydrolysis kinetic studies. The findings record the introduction of extended broad-spectrum beta-lactamases to Australia.
