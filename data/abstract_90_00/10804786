Many efficacious antimicrobial agents have been developed in the latter half of the 20th century, and this has enabled us to overcome bacterial infections. However, various drug-resistant bacteria including MRSA and VRE have been emerging and these strains will cause serious life-threatening medical problems in the 21st century. Since development of new antimicrobial agents currently stagnates++, promoting the appropriate and prudent use of antimicrobial agents based on EBM is strongly recommended. Thus, establishment of a surveillance system of drug-resistant bacterial infections and their epidemiology as well as further activities by clinical technologists as specialists in medical microbiology will be indispensable in the next century.
