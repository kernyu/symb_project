The emergence of some strains of common pathogens of community acquired pneumonia resistant to one or more of the frequently used antimicrobials is becoming widespread. The clinical significance and implications of these resistance patterns are, however, unclear. Studies of the clinical progress of patients with pneumonia or bacteraemia infected with penicillin-resistant organisms show that patients frequently recover when treated with penicillins or cephalosporins. Beta-Lactam drugs and macrolides are still associated with clinical success in lower respiratory tract infections despite increasing resistance to these agents in vitro. Therefore, when making therapeutic choices, in vitro resistance data cannot always be used to predict clinical outcome. Infections caused by resistant organisms can usually be successfully treated using traditional therapeutic approaches.
