Our group has been studying HIV in genital fluids for several years. Our first findings demonstrated that both RNA PCR and proviral DNA PCR could be utilized to quantify virus within seminal interstitial fluid and non-spermatozoa mononuclear cells, respectively. It became clear that these techniques were more sensitive than viral culture and we also reported that both disease progression and treatment influenced sperm viral concentrations generally parallel to virus concentrations in blood. A more recent study from our group has demonstrated that mutations seen in the virus in the blood are seen in the seminal plasma viral as well as in the proviral forms within non-spermatozoa cells. We have also studied female patients for 2-month periods looking at RNA in plasma and cervical secretions, as well as proviral DNA in cervical and vaginal samples by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification techniques. The HIV RNA levels again appears to be the most sensitive and well-related to systemic viral load. Thus, genital secretion of cell-free virus and cells containing proviral DNA in both sexes parallels systemic virus levels, is a site for measurement of transmission of drug-resistant virus and should be monitored in therapy as well as in pathogenesis studies.
