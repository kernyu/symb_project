The management of HIV infected patient requires an approach that must put in balance profits expected from a tritherapy (suppression of viral replication, immune reconstitution) and problems related to treatment (difficulty of adherence, side effects, long-term toxicity, resistance). Controversies appear currently on the institution of a precocious treatment, on the use of protease inhibitors at initiation, in order to preserve choices when a modification is necessary. Many concepts, in investigation, are described in the management of a therapeutic failure. Resistance testings progressively find their place in the follow-up. Modes of prophylaxis-interruption of opportunistic infections are established, as well as is the management of professional postexposure. The question remains on how best to advise seropositive couples, about conception, and to elaborate recommendations after non-professional postexposure.
