We describe a case of a 57-year-old patient with osteomyelitis at a finger of his right hand caused by Candida guilliermondii. The strains isolated were highly resistant to fluconazole and itraconazole. Using the three methods, microdilution, agardilation and E-test, the highest minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) amounted to > 256 micrograms ml-1 for fluconazole and > 32 micrograms ml-1 for itraconazole. To our knowledge, this is the first time such high values have been described for C. guilliermondii. They correlated with the therapeutic non-response to a triazole therapy in our patient. The patient was cured by partial amputation of the affected finger.
