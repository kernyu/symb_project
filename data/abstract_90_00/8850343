Eleven methods for capsule detection of Staphylococcus aureus were compared. The most suitable of them were transmission electron microscopy, determination of the presence of clumping factor, determination of colonial morphology in serum-soft agar, estimation of cell volume and staining with safranine. The determination of clumping factor is a fast and effective method for presumptive diagnosis of capsulated strains, but need to be confirmed by another method. The cell volume estimation is useful for determination of capsule production in liquid cultures, while staining with safranine is suitable for genetic studies of capsule production. The other methods analyzed in this work (Indian ink staining, use of anticapsular antisera, determination of virulence for mice, lisostaphin susceptibility, resistance to phages and resistance to phagocytosis) were laborious, too slow, or need components and/or equipment not available in all laboratories. In addition, two methods of induction of capsule production were assayed, one in vitro by several passages in broth with 10% bovine serum and the other in vitro by intraperitoneal inoculation in mice. Both methods induced capsule production.
