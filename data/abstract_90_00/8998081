Late allergic airway responses can be transferred by CD4+ T cells in the rat. To investigate the role of T-cell cytokines in these responses, we examined the expression of mRNA for Th2 (interleukin [IL]-4 and IL-5) and Th1 (IL-2 and interferon gamma [INF-gamma])-type cytokines in Brown Norway rats that were administered either antigen-primed W3/25(CD4)+ or OX8(CD8)+ T cells. Donors were actively sensitized by subcutaneous injection of ovalbumin (OVA) in the neck and T cells were obtained from the cervical lymph nodes by immunomagnetic cell sorting for administration to unsensitized rats. Control rats received bovine serum albumin (BSA)-primed CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Two days later, recipient rats were challenged with aerosolized OVA, and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed 8 h after challenge. BAL cells expressing mRNA for IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, and INF-gamma were analyzed using the technique of in situ hybridization. Recipients of OVA-primed CD4+ T cells had an increase in the fraction of BAL cells expressing mRNA for IL-4 and IL-5 compared with BSA-primed CD4+ or OVA-primed CD8+ cells (P < 0.001). Recipients of CD8+ T cells had an increase in INF-gamma mRNA expression after OVA challenge compared with recipients of BSA-primed-CD8+ or OVA-primed CD4+ T cells (P < 0.001). In conclusion, T-cell-dependent allergen-induced late responses are associated with the expression of mRNA for IL-4 and IL-5, indicating Th2 cell activation. Furthermore, the increased expression of INF-gamma in allergen challenge recipients of antigen-primed CD8+ T cells suggests that CD8+ T cells may be important in modulating allergic responses.
