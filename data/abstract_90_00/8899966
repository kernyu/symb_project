Glycopeptide resistance in enterococci results from the production of peptidoglycan precursors with low affinity for these antibiotics. The mobility of the resistance genes by transposition and conjugation and the ability of the resistance proteins to interfere with synthesis of normal precursors in different hosts indicate that dissemination into other bacterial species should be anticipated.
