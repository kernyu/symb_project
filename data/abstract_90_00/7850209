The mechanisms of action of antiviral drugs and of drug resistance are known in remarkable detail, partly because X-ray crystallographic structures are known for many target viral proteins. Resistance usually involves amino acid substitutions in the target protein that prevent drug binding or prevent an enzyme from accepting the drug as a substrate. This information allows more effective use of available drugs and aids the development of new drugs.
