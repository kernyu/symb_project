Tetrandrine is a calcium channel antagonist with reported anti-hypertensive effect. The present study aimed to investigate the hemodynamic effects of chronic tetrandrine treatment on normotensive Sprague-Dawley rats. Animals were allocated into one of the two groups: tetrandrine group and vehicle group. Tetrandrine (20 mg/kg) or vehicle was administered by gavage every 12 hours for consecutive 8 days. After 8 days of tetrandrine treatment, systemic hemodynamics and organ blood flows were measured on the next morning after an overnight fast, using radioactive microsphere method. Mean arterial pressure (96 +/- 2 vs. 118 +/- 4 mmHg) and systemic vascular resistance (254 +/- 35 vs. 369 +/- 5 dyn.sec.cm5 x 10(3)/100 g body wt) were significantly decreased in the tetrandine group as compared to the vehicle group. The cardiac-index (35.2 +/- 2.7 vs. 25.5 +/- 0.8 mL/min/100 g body wt) was increased in the tetrandrine group. The portal venous pressure, portal tributary blood flow, portal territory vascular resistance, renal blood flow, renal vascular resistance, heart rate and body weight were similar between the two groups. In conclusion, long-term treatment of tetrandrine reduced mean arterial pressure and systemic vascular resistance but did not change splanchnic or renal hemodynamics in normal rats.
