Plasma concentrations of febantel and its major metabolites, fenbendazole, oxfendazole and fenbendazole sulphone, were determined after oral administration of 7.5 mg/kg febantel in lambs before and 28 days after infection with 100,000 L3 larvae of a benzimidazole (BZ)-sensitive or BZ-resistant strain of Ostertagia circumcincta or with 75,000 L3 larvae of a BZ-sensitive Trichostrongylus colubriformis strain. The febantel concentrations were always low, and in only a few samples were higher than the limit of detection. A mean decrease in the area under the curve (AUC) for the three metabolites of 10.2%, 16.4% and 4.9% in lambs infected, respectively, with BZ-sensitive O. circumcincta, BZ-resistant O. circumcincta and T. colubriformis was observed. The Cmax for all the metabolites was higher in the BZ-sensitive O. circumcincta group than in the naive sheep, while the Tmax occurred earlier. The Cmax and the Tmax values for all the metabolites were lower in the BZ-resistant O. circumcincta group than in their own naive controls. In the T. colubriformis group the Cmax values of the metabolites were lower and the Tmax occurred much later.
