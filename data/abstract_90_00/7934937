Multidrug-resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis have resulted in several recent outbreaks. Recognition of drug resistance is important both for treatment and to prevent further transmission. Here we use molecular biology techniques to study the basis of streptomycin resistance in single and multidrug-resistant M. tuberculosis. We demonstrate that streptomycin resistance is associated with mutations implicated in ribosomal resistance. The mutations found either lead to amino acid changes in ribosomal protein S12 or alter the primary structure of the 16S rRNA. The 16S rRNA region mutated perturbs a pseudoknot structure in a region which has been linked to ribosomal S12 protein.
