The role of mutations in the genes for GyrA and ParC in quinolone resistance in Mycoplasma hominis was studied. Selection with sparfloxacin gave mutations at GyrA83 (Ser-->Leu; Escherichia coli numbering) or GyrA87 (Glu-->Lys), and mutants had increased levels of resistance to sparfloxacin (8- to 16-fold) but not to ofloxacin. Selection with ofloxacin gave changes at ParC80 (Ser-->Ile) or ParC84 (Glu-->Lys), and mutants were four- to eightfold more resistant to ofloxacin but not to sparfloxacin. Selection of second-step mutants from strains with ParC mutations with either quinolone yielded double mutants with additional mutations at GyrA83 (Ser-->Trp or Ser-->Leu) or GyrA87 (Glu-->Lys). Second-step selection of GyrA mutants gave additional mutations at ParC80 (Ser-->Ile) or ParC84 (Glu-->Lys). Two-step mutants showed high levels of resistance to ofloxacin (MICs, 64 to 128 microg/ml) and moderate levels of resistance to sparfloxacin (MICs, 2 to 8 microg/ml). The primary target of ofloxacin in first-step mutants of Mycoplasma hominis was ParC, whereas that for sparfloxacin was GyrA.
