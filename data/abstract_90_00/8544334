The frequencies of isolation and susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents were investigated on 848 bacterial strains isolated from patients with urinary tract infections in 10 hospitals during the period of June 1990 to May 1991. Of the above total bacterial isolates, Gram-positive bacteria accounted for 23.9% and a majority of them were Enterococcus faecalis. Gram-negative bacteria accounted for 76.1% and most of them were Escherichia coli. 1. Enterococcus faecalis: Ampicillin (ABPC), imipenem (IPM) and vancomycin (VCM) showed the highest activities against E. faecalis isolated from patients with urinary tract infections. The MIC90s of them were 2 micrograms/ml. Piperacillin (PIPC) was also active with the MIC90 of 4 micrograms/ml. The others were not so active with the MIC90s of 32 micrograms/ml or above. 2. Staphylococcus aureus: VCM and arbekacin (ABK) showed the highest activities against S. aureus isolated from patients with urinary tract infections. The MIC90s of them were 1 micrograms/ml. The others were not so active with the MIC90s of 32 micrograms/ml or above. 3. Escherichia coli: Cefozopran (CZOP), carumonam (CRMN) and ofloxacin (OFLX) showed the highest activities against E. coli isolated from patients with urinary tract infections. The MIC90s of them were of 0.125 microgram/ml or below. IPM, cefotiam (CTM) and cefmenoxime (CMX) were also active with the MIC90s of 0.25 micrograms/ml. Penicillins were not so active with the MIC90s of 32 micrograms/ml or above. 4. Klebsiella pneumoniae: Flomoxef (FMOX), cefixime (CFIX), CZOP and CRMN showed the highest activities against K. pneumoniae isolated from patients with urinary tract infections. The MIC90s of them were of 0.125 microgram/ml or below. IPM and gentamicin (GM) were also active with the MIC90s of 0.25 microgram/ml and 0.5 microgram/ml, respectively. All other cephems were also active with the MIC90s of 4 micrograms/ml or below. 5. Citrobacter freundii: GM and IPM showed the highest activities against C. freundii isolated from patients with urinary tract infections. The MIC90s of them were 1 microgram/ml. Amikacin (AMK) was also active with the MIC90 of 4 micrograms/ml. The others were not so active. 6. Enterobacter cloacae: IPM and GM showed the highest activities against E. cloacae isolated from patients with urinary tract infections. The MIC90s of them MIC90s of 0.5 microgram/ml. AMK and OFLX were also active with the MIC90s of 4 micrograms/ml. Penicillins and cephems generally showed lower activities. 7. Proteus mirabilis: Most of the agents were active against P. mirabilis. Cephems were generally active with the MIC90s in a range of < or = 0.125 microgram/ml-4 micrograms/ml.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
