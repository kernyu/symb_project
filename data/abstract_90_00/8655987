The long-term impact of annual case-finding and chemotherapy with praziquantel on schistosomiasis japonica was examined in an 8-year longitudinal study in the Philippines. The prevalence, incidence, and intensity of infection and schistosome-induced hepatomegaly significantly decreased within 3-4 years of treatment and then stabilized despite continual population-based chemotherapy. Hepatomegaly rapidly developed in acutely infected persons, with 82% of subjects developing hepatic enlargement within 2 years of reinfection. These data suggest that abrupt discontinuation of current control measures in the Philippines may result in a rapid rebound in morbidity. Age-dependent acquired resistance to reinfection also developed in subjects chronically exposed to schistosomiasis japonica, suggesting that a vaccine may represent an alternative approach for control of this parasitic infection.
