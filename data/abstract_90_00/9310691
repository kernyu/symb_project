During the past 15 years, important contributions have been made to the field of anaerobes in Canada. Studies on the importance of the intestinal flora as a source of vitamin K for humans, investigations of the mechanisms of synergy in polymicrobial infections, and extensive research on the field of immunocompetence of surgical patients have provided interesting and valuable information. Several clinical and epidemiological studies of anaerobic infections have been carried out. Rapid methods have been developed for the identification and susceptibility testing of clinical isolates. National and regional surveys have been conducted on the susceptibility patterns of the Bacteroides fragilis group. Studies on the mechanism of action of metronidazole and on the mechanisms of resistance of Bacteroides species have also been carried out. The Canadian Infectious. Disease Society has published position papers on therapy with cefotetan, ceftizoxime, and imipenem and on antimicrobial prophylaxis in surgical patients.
