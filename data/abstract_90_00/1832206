Nicotiana tabacum lines carrying maternally inherited resistance to spectinomycin were obtained by selection for green callus in cultures bleached by spectinomycin. Two levels of resistance was found. SPC1 and SPC2 seedlings are resistant to high levels (500 micrograms/ml), SPC23 seedlings are resistant to low levels (50 micrograms/ml) of spectinomycin. Lines SPC2 and SPC23 are derivatives of the SR1 streptomycin-resistant plastome mutant. Spectinomycin resistance is due to mutations in the plastid 16S ribosomal RNA: SPC1, an A to C change at position 1138; SPC2, a C to U change at position 1139; SPC23, a G to A change at position 1333. Mutations similar to those in the SPC1 and SPC2 lines have been previously described, and disrupt a conserved 16S ribosomal RNA stem structure. The mutation in the SPC23 line is the first reported case of a mutation close to the region of the 16S rRNA involved in the formation of the initiation complex. The new mutants provide markers for selecting plastid transformants.
