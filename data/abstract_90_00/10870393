The malaria risk for travellers to West or East Africa is roughly 2-4% per month. In Germany, the mortality rate, in comparison with other countries, is a relatively high 2.4%. This means that in the absence of prophylactic measures, 4-8 out of 10,000 travellers will die. The risk of contracting malaria in Asia and South America is lower. Travellers to regions in which malaria is endemic, should take advantage of the effective prophylactic measures available. The two most important preventive strategies are: avoidance of mosquito bites (exposure prophylaxis) and the eradication of plasmodia that have already invaded the body. Currently, no antimalarial vaccination is available.
