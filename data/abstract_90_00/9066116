Out of a collection of 56 Staphylococcus aureus clinical strains from 1971 to 1990 in Japan, we found one 1971 isolate, strain MS8968, harboring plasmid pMS97. A transductant strain, MS15009(pMS97), showed inducible resistance to a group of drugs, the so-called MLS antibiotics in the presence of a low concentration of erythromycin (EM). However, in the case of oleandomycin (OL), the strain showed resistance to another group of antibiotics: 14-membered macrolides (EM and OL), a 16-membered macrolide (mycinamicin I), and type B streptogramin, the so-called PMS antibiotics. Moreover, plasmid pMS97 contained an erm gene with universal primers specific for erm A, AM, B, BC, C, C', and G and an msrA gene with primers specific for msrA. The first finding suggests that two genes encoding functionally different mechanisms for MLS and PMS resistance, erm and msrA, are present together within plasmid pMS97 originating from S. aureus.
