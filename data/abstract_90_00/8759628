Two novel series of 2-pyridones were synthesized by transposition of the nitrogen of 4-quinolones to the bridgehead position. This subtle interchange of the nitrogen atom with a carbon atom yielded two novel heterocyclic nuclei, pyrido[1,2-alpha]pyrimidine and quinolizine, which had not previously been evaluated as antibacterial agents and were found to be potent inhibitors of DNA gyrase. Quinolizines with a methyl group at the 9-position such as (S)-45a (ABT-719) demonstrate exceptional broad spectrum antibacterial activity. Most notably, they are active against resistant bacteria such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant strains of enterococci, and ciprofloxacin-resistant organisms. In addition, 2-pyridones also possess favorable physiochemical and pharmacokinetic properties. These 2-pyridones were synthesized from the commercially available starting materials by 10-17 linear transformations. The structure of an adduct yielded by this sequence, (S)-45a (ABT-719), was determined by X-ray crystallographic analysis.
