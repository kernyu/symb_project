Strains of Vibrio parahaemolyticus were isolated from clinical, marine and freshwater fish of Calcutta, West Bengal, India. Drug and metal resistance characteristics were compared for differentiation of clinical and environmental strains. Eighteen out of the twenty environmental isolates were resistant to arsenate, unlike the clinical isolates which were all susceptible. All the thirty-five isolates of V. parahaemolyticus were resistant to ampicillin and streptomycin.
