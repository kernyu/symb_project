Multiple isolates of Helicobacter pylori from antral biopsies of nine patients were examined by DNA fingerprinting. Analysis of rRNA gene patterns and HaeIII restriction fragment length polymorphism of PCR-amplified urease genes were compared and used to study colonization before and after failed triple therapy. H. pylori isolates from a single biopsy shared the same HaeIII DNA fingerprint regardless of the isolation method (plate or broth). DNA pattern types of paired strains of H. pylori were distinct between patients and were not grossly affected by treatment except for one patient with an altered strain type. H. pylori infections were generally associated with several subpopulations of strains, evident from the subtypic variation before and after treatment, detectable by both DNA fingerprinting methods. The urease gene patterns also provided evidence that some cultures of H. pylori probably contained a mixture of genomic subtypes. The study suggests that triple therapy has the effect either of inducing minor genomic variations or of changing the proportions of different subtypes of H. pylori. It was concluded that urease gene profiling provides a simple yet reliable method of establishing whether treatment failures are attributable to incomplete eradication of H. pylori.
