We measured the sensitivity to antibacterials of Staphylococcus aureus isolated from impetigo lesions during one year (from July 1994 to July 1995). The largest number of strains was resistant to gentamicin, followed by erythromycin. Few methicillin-resistant S. aureus strains were isolated and few strains were resistant to more than one drug. We conclude that nadifloxacin and tosufloxacin are likely to be most effective against S. aureus, but fusidic acid is more suitable for the treatment of children.
