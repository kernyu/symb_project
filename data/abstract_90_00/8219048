In an effort to understand the mechanism of streptomycin resistance in Nicotiana plumbaginifolia, we have sequenced the chloroplast rps12 gene, a potential molecular target. We report that a streptomycin-resistant mutant isolated from protoplast cultures of N. plumbaginifolia contains an A-to-G transition at nucleotide position 149 in exon 2 of the chloroplast rps12 gene. The detected point mutation predicts a substitution of arginine for lysine in a phylogenetically conserved region.
