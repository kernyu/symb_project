Reported studies have implicated eugenol in the reduction in retention of restorations luted with chemically cured composite resin cement. This study investigated the effect of residual eugenol in the root canal on the retention of ParaPost dowels cemented with Panavia EX composite resin. An attempt was also made to identify and to determine the most effective cleansing procedure. Findings of this study demonstrated a substantial decrease in retention of posts luted with Panavia composite resin cement in the presence of eugenol. Irrigation with ethyl alcohol (ethanol) or etching with 37% phosphoric acid gel was found to be effective in restoring the resistance to dislodgment of the posts, but alcohol produced the most consistent and reliable results.
