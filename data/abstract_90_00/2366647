The occurrence and the extension of chemoresistance of Plasmodium falciparum to antimalaria drugs in Central Africa set to think about new strategies of prevention. Beside chemoprophylaxis limited to certain groups at particular risks, the authors suggest to rehabilitate vector control and particularly to promote the systematized use of bed-nets impregnated with residual insecticides. Prevention of lethality has to continue to use, in first instance, quinine and amino-4-quinoleins, under condition that an efficient national organization be set up to monitor the chemosensibility of plasmodial strains toward different antimalarial drugs.
