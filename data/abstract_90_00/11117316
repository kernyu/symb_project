Three kanamycin A analogs containing 6-amino-6-deoxyglycofuranoses have been prepared as candidates for potential activity against resistant bacteria producing 6'-N-acetyltransferase. They are 4-O-(6-amino-3,5,6-trideoxy-alpha-D-, -beta-D-, and -beta-L-erythro -hexofuranosyl)-6-O-(3-amino-3-deoxy-alpha-D-glucopyranosyl)-2,5-dideoxy-5-epi-5- fluorostreptamine. Structure-activity relationships of these compounds are discussed.
