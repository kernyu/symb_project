Light and antimycin markedly affected growth and carotenoid synthesis by Phaffia rhodozyma. Exposure of the yeast to high light intensities on agar plates resulted in growth inhibition and decreased carotenoid synthesis. The carotenoid compositions of the yeast were also notably changed by light. Beta-zeacarotene increased, whereas beta-carotene and xanthophylls decreased including astaxanthin, phoenicoxanthin, and 3-hydroxy-3',4'-didehydro-beta,psi-caroten-4-one (HDCO). In liquid medium, growth of the wild-type strain (UCD-FST-67-385) was inhibited by antimycin, but this inhibition was relieved by exposure to light. Light also stimulated carotenoid synthesis about twofold in these antimycin-treated cells. Light may have rescued growth by induction of an alternative oxidase system which facilitated electron disposal when the main respiratory chain was inhibited by antimycin. Isolation and characterization of the oxidase enzymes should be useful in strain development for increased carotenoid production.
