The mechanisms of anion transport in the rabbit distal colon were investigated in vitro under short-circuit conditions by examining the effects of transport inhibitors (the stilbene derivatives SITS and DIDS) under a variety of conditions. These agents consistently inhibited Jm-sCl: SITS (10(-3) M) reduced both unidirectional chloride fluxes to the same degree and did not alter JnetCl. In contrast, 10(-4) M DIDS had no effect on Js-mCl and had a significant chloride antiabsorptive effect. DIDS had no effect on either tissue cyclic AMP levels or on basal flux of potassium. The effects of SITS and the cyclic AMP-related secretagogue theophylline on Isc were independent. Additionally, there was no significant alteration of intracellular potential difference or apical membrane fractional resistance elicited by SITS during microelectrode impalement of colonic surface epithelial cells. These results suggest a complex mechanism of anion transport in the distal colon, with a component of electrogenic anion absorption inhibited by the stilbenes. The subsequent changes in current, conductance, and chloride fluxes are dependent upon additional, independent anion transport processes. These pharmacologic agents exhibit an antiabsorptive effect, rather than a stimulation of electrogenic chloride secretion.
