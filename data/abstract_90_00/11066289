Despite changes in the activities of infectious microorganisms, particularly variations in their prevalences in different parts of the body, in clinically defined diseases, and in their susceptibilities to antibiotics, the established first-line agents for the empiric treatment of otitis media and pharyngitis are still valid. Nevertheless, a number of the newer antimicrobials have become valuable as second- and third-line medications when the first-choice drugs fail or are contraindicated. In terms of fundamental principles, the question of whether pharyngitis in children warrants routine antibiotic therapy remains unresolved; in practical terms, antibiotic treatment should be considered routinely.
