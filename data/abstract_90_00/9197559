Tear lactoferrin concentration was measured by ELISA technique and followed in 30 patients undergoing cataract surgery. On the first day following surgery, there was a significant decrease in tear lactoferrin concentration followed by a gradual return to the initial values during the postoperative observation period of 7 days. There was an inverse linear relationship between tear lactoferrin concentration and the tear secretion rate measured by a modified Schirmer I test (1 min) suggesting a constant lactoferrin secretion by the tear glands. Since lactoferrin has known antibacterial and anti-inflammatory effects, the results may contribute to further understanding of the microbial vulnerability or resistance of the eye following surgical procedures.
