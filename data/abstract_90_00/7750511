This study reports comparative dose-response data for kainic acid (KA) induced seizures in juvenile (35-40 days old) and adult (70-90 days old) Wistar-Furth (WF), Fisher 344 (F344), Sprague-Dawley (SD) and Long-Evans Hooded (LEH) rats. Juvenile male WF (n = 51), F344 (n = 55), SD (n = 60), LEH (n = 50) and adult male WF (n = 48), F344 (n = 52), SD (n = 52), LEH (n = 53) rats were given KA 6, 8, 10, 12 or 14 mg/kg, sc. As previously demonstrated adult WF and F344 rats showed the greatest sensitivity and most reliable convulsant responses to kainic acid; SD and LEH rats were less sensitive and showed more variable convulsant responses. Regardless of strain, all juvenile rats exhibited greater sensitivity and less variable convulsant response to KA compared to adults. This was most evident in juvenile SD and LEH rats. Results suggest that while seizure sensitivity to KA decreases with age, genetic factors may regulate the expression of this resistance.
