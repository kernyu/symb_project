The mechanism of transport of KP-736, a novel cephalosporin with a 1,5-dihydroxy-4-pyridone moiety at the C-7 position, into the Escherichia coli K-12 cell was investigated by determining the susceptibilities of iron transport mutants to KP-736. The tonB mutant showed a higher degree of resistance to KP-736, indicating that KP-736 was incorporated into E. coli cells via the tonB-dependent iron transport system. The product of the exbB gene was also necessary for the maximal antibacterial potency of KP-736. Cir-lacking and Fiu-lacking mutants showed a moderate level of resistance to KP-736. However, mutants lacking any one of the proteins FepA, FecA, FhuA, and FhuE did not show any increased resistance to KP-736. Two types of spontaneous mutants (e.g., KT1004 and KT1011) could be isolated from cir and fiu mutants by selection for KP-736 resistance and showed the same level of resistance to KP-736 as a tonB mutant. KT1004 showed tonB phenotypes, resistance to phage phi 80, and loss of FecA, whereas KT1011 did not. KT1011 lost the ability to express both Cir and Fiu proteins. These results indicate that the Cir and Fiu outer membrane proteins are involved specifically in the tonB-dependent transport process of KP-736. Against OmpF- and OmpC-deficient transformants producing various groups of beta-lactamases, KP-736 was more effective than the other cephalosporins tested.
