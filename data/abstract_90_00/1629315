Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium isolates that are resistant to vancomycin have recently been identified in North America and Europe. Of 155 clinical isolates of enterococci (113 E. faecium and 42 E. faecalis), we found that 98 were resistant, 52 were moderately susceptible, and 5 had intermediate susceptibilities to vancomycin by using broth microdilution susceptibility testing according to the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) (Approved Standard M7-A2). Using NCCLS disk diffusion methodology (Approved Standard M2-A4), we evaluated the NCCLS supplemental M100-S3 revisions for zone diameter interpretive standards and incubation conditions and found 5.8% minor errors. A total of 234 isolates, which included an additional 79 E. faecium isolates that were moderately susceptible to vancomycin, were used to evaluate the Vitek GPS-TA card (bioMerieux, Inc., Hazelwood, Mo.) and the Pos MIC type 6 panel (MicroScan; Baxter Health Care Corp., West Sacramento, Calif.) for the detection of vancomycin resistance. The Vitek card was 100% specific and 72% sensitive, whereas the MicroScan panel with the Walk/Away system was 98% specific, with a sensitivity of 93% which increased to 99% when readings were performed manually. An agar screen plate method was evaluated with vancomycin concentrations of 6, 8, 10, or 12 micrograms/ml; plates were inoculated so as to obtain a final concentration of 10(5) CFU per spot. This method was found to be 100% sensitive and specific at all concentrations.
