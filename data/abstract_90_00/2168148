Nucleotide sequence analysis of the gyrA genes of 10 spontaneous quinolone-resistant gyrA mutants of Escherichia coli KL16, including four mutants examined previously, disclosed that quinolone resistance was caused by a point mutation within the region between amino acids 67 and 106, especially in the vicinity of amino acid 83, of the GyrA protein.
