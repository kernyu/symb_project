The in-vitro activity of PD 131628, the active metabolite of the prodrug PD 131112, was compared with that of ciprofloxacin and members of other groups of antimicrobial agents against 701 recent clinical isolates and strains with known mechanisms of resistance. The MIC90s of PD 131628 against the Enterobacteriaceae were between 0.008 and 0.5 mg/L; PD 131628 was one- to four-fold more active than ciprofloxacin against these strains and was four-fold more active than ciprofloxacin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Against the Gram-positive species tested, PD 131628 was two- to four-fold more active than ciprofloxacin, inhibiting all strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae with 0.5 mg/L or less. PD 131628 was very active against Neisseria spp., Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis, with MIC90s ranging from 0.004 to 0.008 mg/L. Organisms with decreased susceptibility to other quinolones had decreased susceptibility to PD 131628, but there was no cross-resistance between this class of antimicrobial and other classes. The protein binding of PD 131628 was at most 25% across a broad range of concentrations. The addition of 70% human serum had little effect on the MICs, but caused a two- to eight-fold increase in MBCs.
