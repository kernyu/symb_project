Genes belonging to different erm DNA hybridization classes were selectively amplified by polymerase chain reaction with a pair of oligonucleotides that corresponded to conserved amino acid motifs in known ERM methylases. Identification of the resistance mechanism was possible despite substantial nucleotide sequence diversity among the erythromycin resistance genes.
