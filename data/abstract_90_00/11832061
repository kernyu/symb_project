OBJECTIVE: To understand the change of the main pathogenic microbes of biliary infection and their resistance rates to 12 antibiotics so as to instruct rational application of antibiotics clinically. METHODS: All isolates were identified by analytic products incorporation (API) bioMerieux. The susceptibility of antibiotics to 470 pathogenic microbes was tested by minimal inhibition concentration (MIC). RESULTS: There were 470 pathogenic microbes with positive biliary culture. The percentage of Escherichia coli, intestinal cocci and Klebsiella pneumoniae was 129 (27.4%), 82 (17.4%) and 76 (16.2%), respectively. In the resistance rates of the gram negative bacilli to 12 antibiotics, the lowest was 4.0% for imipenem followed by. 14.1% Ceftazidime and 16.9% amikacin. In the resistant rates of the gram positive cocci to 12 antibiotics, and had the lowest rate was 6.0% for vancomycin and 16.4% for imipenem. CONCLUSIONS: The main pathogenic microbes of biliary infection were Escherichia coli, intestinal cocci and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Imipenem is the first used for biliary infection in dealing with multiresistant intestinal cocci.
