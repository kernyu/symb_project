A collection of 17 bifidobacteria was tested for sensitivity or resistance to lantibiotic nisin. Minimal inhibitory concentration of the strain tested was highly variable, ranging from 4.88 to 10,000 IU-1. In general, strains isolated from faecal samples were more resistant than those purchased from culture collections. These results could be useful in the production of foods containing both bifidobacteria and nisin.
