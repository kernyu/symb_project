The general principles of screening antibiotics for antimicrobial activity are similar to those for screening for other pharmacological effects. The system should be adapted to the specific character of the test substance and the objectives of the program. In the screening of beta-lactams, standard tests, such as determination of the MICs, effects of inoculum size or activity against systemic infection in mice, should be supplemented by less conventional studies on for instance activity against dormant bacteria or, in the case of penems or carbapenems, stability in the presence of kidney and lung dehydropeptidases.
