Antiviral potency of an ointment dosage form of interferon (IF) inducer ridostin has been demonstrated in guinea pigs with genital herpes. Early beginning of therapy led to a 72% decrease of the intensity of clinical signs with cure 12-13 days earlier than in the control. Application of ridostin ointment onto the skin of intact animals caused an increase of IF level in the blood and of the phagocytic activity of peritoneal exudation macrophages. Ridostin effect on the total-systems factors of nonspecific defense appears to be one mechanism in the formation of antiviral resistance upon external application of this IF inducer.
