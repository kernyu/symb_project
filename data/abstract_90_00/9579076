A clinical Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain, PAe391, was found to be resistant to a number of antibiotics including ticarcillin, piperacillin, cefsulodin and amikacin, and a disk diffusion assay showed evidence of pronounced synergy between imipenem and various beta-lactam antibiotics. Cloning and nucleotide sequence analysis revealed the dicistronic arrangement of an aac(6')-Ib variant and a novel blaOXA-type gene between the intI and qacE delta 1 genes typical of integrons, in PAe391, this integron was apparently chromosome-borne. The beta-lactamase, named OXA-13, displayed nine amino acid changes with respect to OXA-10:I in position 10 of OXA-10 to T (I10T), G20S, D55N, N73S, T107S, Y174F, E229G, S245N and E259A, OXA-13 (pIapp = 8.0) showed poor catalytic activity against penicillins as well as cephalosporins, but was efficient in hydrolysing some penicillinase-resistant beta-lactams, such as cefotaxime and aztreonam. It was efficiently inhibited by imipenem (KIapp = 11 nM), and formed a stable complex. While the KIapp value of meropenem was similar (16 nM), the corresponding complex was less stable.
