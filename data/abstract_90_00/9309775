Parasitic helminths (worms) cause serious infectious diseases in humans and domestic animals. Control of these infections relies mostly on chemotherapeutics (the anthelmintics), but resistance has developed against most of these broad-spectrum drugs in many parasite species. These resistant parasites are being used to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of drug resistance and drug action. This has led to the development of sensitive assays to detect resistant parasites, but this has not delayed the emergence of additional drug resistant parasite populations. Therefore, as development of new drugs by pharmaceutical companies is slow, we may have to be prepared for a time when broad-spectrum drugs are no longer effective, especially against worms of sheep.
