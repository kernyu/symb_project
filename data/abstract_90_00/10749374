When combined, enviroxime and disoxaril, two selective picornavirus inhibitors, exert a marked synergistic inhibitory effect on poliovirus type 1 replication in FL cells. The cytotoxicity of the compounds applied individually and in combination to the same cells was examined. The quantitative assay of the cytotoxic effect was made by determination of the growth curve of uninfected FL cells in the presence of increasing concentrations of the compounds applied alone and in combination. The obtained results indicate lack of a synergic cytotoxic effect of the combination of enviroxime and disoxaril. The previously established synergistic antiviral effect, and the lack of cross-resistance and synergic cytotoxic effect classify the combination of enviroxime and disoxaril as a very promising chemotherapeutic.
