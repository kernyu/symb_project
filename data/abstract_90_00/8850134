The high animal concentration in intensive production brings about problems due to the volume of excreta and environmental pollution with the consequent risk for animal and human health. Therefore, previous to the application of any strategy of organic wastes recycling it is necessary to know possible sanitary risks. Farm organic wastes can be recycled through the intensive breeding of earthworms from species Eisenia foetida (Annelida, Oligochaeta) which can break down the consumed organic substance into humus. E. foetida is able to accelerate biodegrading wastes decomposition. It has been selected for recycling because its self productivity, its capacity to live in high concentrations, its feeding habits as well as its resistance to stress. The aim of this work is to study the microbial flora potentially pathogenic and their survival in the intestinal tract in sexually mature earthworms cultivated in composted broiler litter. Total coliforms, faecal coliforms, Salmonella, Pseudomonas and other enteric bacteria were sought in accordance with the recommended methodology. In E. foetida no positive results were obtained in the MPN/g (most probable number) of total coliforms, faecal coliforms, Salmonella, Pseudomonas and other Enterobacteriaceae family bacteria. These results suggest an antimicrobial response upon Gram negative bacteria from the gizzard and through the intestinal tract.
