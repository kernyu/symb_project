Escherichia coli and Salmonella strains resistant to gentamicin and apramycin were isolated from cattle in France and Belgium and from patients in hospitals. Homology between plasmids of both human and animal origins encoding aminoglycoside 3-N-acetyltransferase was revealed by digestion with several restriction endonucleases and confirmed by hybridization with different replicon-specific probes.
