We describe a simple procedure for detecting fluconazole-resistant yeasts by a disk diffusion method. Forty clinical Candida sp. isolates were tested on RPMI-glucose agar with either 25- or 50-microgram fluconazole disks. With 25-microgram disks, zones of inhibition of >/=20 mm at 24 h accurately identified 29 of 29 isolates for which MICs were </=8 microgram/ml, and with 50-microgram disks, zones of >/=27 mm identified 28 of 29 such isolates. All 11 isolates for which MICs were >8 microgram/ml were identified by using either disk. Disk diffusion may be a useful screening method for clinical microbiology laboratories.
