The activity of the fluoroquinolone flumequine was investigated against the fish pathogen Aeromonas salmonicida and was compared with that of oxolinic acid. Flumequine was more active than oxolinic acid in terms of its MIC against oxolinic acid-resistant isolates of A. salmonicida and was as active as oxolinic acid against susceptible isolates. In contrast to oxolinic acid, flumequine was bactericidal, with only 1% of the bacteria surviving 6 h of exposure to the drug at concentrations slightly above the MIC. Mutation to resistance to flumequine was found to occur at a lower frequency than that to oxolinic acid. Hence, in vitro, flumequine appears to possess some advantages over oxolinic acid against this fish pathogen.
