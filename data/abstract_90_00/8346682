The Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene for para-aminobenzoate (PABA) synthase has been identified based upon its ability to confer sulfonamide resistance when present on a multicopy episomal vector. The 3840 bp DNA sequence fragment reported here contains a 2199 bp open reading frame encoding a 733 amino acid protein with similarity to the two components of PABA synthase described for prokaryotes (Escherichia coli PabA and PabB), suggesting that PABA synthase is bifunctional in yeast. The cloned sequence was confirmed to be PABA synthase by gene disruption. Chromosome gel analysis places the gene for PABA synthase on chromosome XIV.
