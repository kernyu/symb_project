The pharmacokinetic properties of mefloquine hydrochloride (15 mg base kg -1) were studied in 12 Karen children (five girls, seven boys) aged between 5 and 10 years presenting with uncomplicated falciparum malaria. The drug was well tolerated. Mean (s.d.) peak blood drug concentrations of 2031 (831) ng ml-1 were reached in a median of 8 (range 6-24) h. Mean (s.d.) estimates for oral clearance and mean residence time were 0.52 (0.27) ml min -1 kg -1 and 15.3 (4.7) days, respectively. These values are similar to those reported previously in adults. In one child parasitaemia failed to clear despite whole blood mefloquine concentrations which peaked at 1744 ng ml -1; parasitaemia rose and fever recurred when blood drug concentrations had fallen to 442 ng ml -1. The prevalence of highly mefloquine resistant parasites such as this can be expected to increase under drug pressure in this area.
