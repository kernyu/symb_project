We have been exploring the mechanism of action of 5-(3,4-dichlorophenyl) methylhydantoin (hydantoin), an antiviral drug that inhibits the replication of poliovirus in culture. By varying the time of drug addition to infected cells, we found that the drug acts at a stage which is late in the replication cycle and subsequent to the step inhibited by guanidine. Furthermore, we detected normal levels of full-length plus-strand virion RNA in hydantoin-treated cultures. A new assembly intermediate in addition to the expected assembly intermediates was detected in drug-treated cultures. This intermediate has properties consistent with that of a packaging intermediate. Drug-resistant mutants were readily isolated. Sequence analysis of three independent drug-resistant mutants identified amino acid substitutions in the 2C coding region. Reconstruction by site-directed mutagenesis confirmed that these single mutations were sufficient to confer drug resistance. Taken together, these data suggest that the poliovirus 2C region is involved in virus encapsidation and that hydantoin inhibits this stage of replication.
