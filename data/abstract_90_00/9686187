Resistance to Trypanosoma cruzi infections is critically dependent on cytokine-mediated activation of cell-mediated immune effector mechanisms. This review focuses on the role of IL-10, TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma and IL-12 in controlling T. cruzi replication by the innate and specific immune systems of the vertebrate host. A study performed on mice with disrupted recombinase-activating genes (RAG/KO), which lack T and B lymphocytes, revealed the importance of IL-12, IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha in the resistance against T. cruzi mediated by the innate immune system. In addition, data from experiments using IL-10 KO, RAG/KO and double RAG/IL-10 KO mice indicating an in vivo regulatory role of IL-10 in innate and T. cruzi-specific immunity are discussed.
