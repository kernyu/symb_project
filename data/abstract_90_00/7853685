Cefozopran (CZOP, SCE-2787), a new parenteral cephem, was evaluated for its antibacterial activity and clinical efficacy. CZOP, 24.0-78.0 mg/kg/day, was given to 11 pediatric patients in 3 dose a day via 30-minute drip infusion. Clinically evaluated were nine patients including 4 with acute pneumonia, 2 with urinary tract infections, 2 with lymphadenitis and 1 with sepsis. Two patients were excluded because of possible non-bacterial infections. Clinical efficacies were excellent in 5, good in 3 and fair in 1. Bacteriological responses were confirmed for 5 strains in 5 patients. Four strains were eradicated, but one strain was not. MICs of CZOP were equal to those of ceftazidime. Side effects or abnormal laboratory test results were observed in 3 patients; diarrhea in 1, elevated GPT in 1 and thrombocytosis in 1, but none of them was significant.
