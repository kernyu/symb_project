An analogue of deoxyspergualin, N-563 has an immunostimulating activity whereas the mother compound has been found to be a potent immunosuppressant. In this study, the protective effect of the analogue against C. albicans infection was investigated in normal and immunosuppressed mice. In normal mice, N-563 treatment at 10 mg/kg for 3 days prior to infection significantly prolonged the survival time. In immunosuppressed mice treated with a single dose of cyclophosphamide 4 days prior to infection, N-563 at 3 and 10 mg/kg for 3 days prior to infection also significantly prolonged the survival time of mice. In addition, it augmented the phagocytic activity of neutrophils and enhanced the delayed type hypersensitivity reaction against C. albicans. Coincidentally, N-563 appeared to protect against secondary infection with C. albicans in the delayed type hypersensitivity-positive mice.
