Contemporary issues in the dietary management of children with acute diarrhea include the optimal timing of introduction of foods during illness, the appropriate use of milk-containing treatment regimens and mixed diets containing common staple foods, and the proper use of specific micronutrient supplements. Results of recent clinical trials indicate that children should be fed continuously during illness with their usual diets. Most young children fed exclusively with non-human milks can continue to consume these products. However, the subgroup of patients with more severe diarrhea and dehydration may have a slightly increased rate of complications and would, therefore, benefit from close supervision or a modification of their diet. Breastfed infants should continue to nurse at the breast during diarrhea. Treatment of anorexia consists of correction of the underlying metabolic derangements and antimicrobial therapy when indicated. Despite the previous focus of dietary management during diarrhea, attention to convalescent feeding is also necessary to assure complete nutritional recovery following illness.
