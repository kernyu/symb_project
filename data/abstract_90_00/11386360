The genetic determinants for the biosynthesis of the glycopeptide antibiotic teicoplanin were identified. In order to isolate the corresponding gene cluster, oligonucleotides derived from highly conserved motifs in peptide synthetases were used. These synthetic probes, and gene fragments derived from the balhimycin gene cluster of Amycolatopsis mediterranei, led to the identification of the likely teicoplanin gene cluster centered on a region of ca. 110 kb from the genome of Actinoplanes teichomyceticus, the teicoplanin producer. Partial nucleotide sequences identified partial ORFs likely to encode two glycosyltransferases, three P-450 monooxygenases and one ABC transporter. The corresponding genes have been found in other glycopeptide gene clusters. Furthermore, upstream to the peptide synthetase region a segment was identified with a remarkable similarity to the vanHAX operon, conferring resistance to glycopeptides in enterococci. Thus, in contrast to the other glycopeptide producers thus far analyzed, in A. teichomyceticus the genes for teicoplanin biosynthesis are closely linked to homologs of glycopeptide resistance commonly found in vancomycin-resistant enterococci.
