A survey of the pattern of usage of ototopical preparations in out-patients of the ENT department of a Dutch University Hospital has been performed. Data on clinical presentation and previous treatment of the patient, otoscopic results, prescribed current treatment and, if available, results of microbiological examination were collected. One-hundred and twenty-one evaluable patients were prospectively included. For 20% of the patients it concerned a first manifestation of the symptoms, 35% had a recurrence after a period free of symptoms and in 37% it concerned patients with persisting symptoms despite treatment. Forty-five percent of the patients' ears concerned had an intact tympanic membrane, in 25% a perforation was present and in 12% middle ear ventilation tubes were in situ. Thirty-five percent had already received previous treatment with ear drops. The species most often isolated was Staphylococcus aureus, followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. A wide range of products were prescribed. While previous treatment occurred with combination preparations, for current prescriptions, ofloxacin was most often used. Most patients received 2 to 3 drops 3 times a day for 7 to 10 days, which is in accordance with recommendations in the literature. Potentially ototoxic substances are regularly used in daily practice. Ofloxacin is widely used even thought it is not registered for this indication in the Netherlands and the development of resistance has to be taken into account. A new policy based on this survey is proposed, which will reduce the number of different preparations used and will eliminate ofloxacin from first the treatment.
