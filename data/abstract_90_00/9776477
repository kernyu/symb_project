The immunopharmacological characteristics of angelan, a polysaccharide purified from Angelica gigas Nakai, were investigated in relation to the specificity to immune cells. The treatment of angelan increased the expression of IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, and IFN-gamma. The expression of IL-6 and IFN-gamma was rapidly augmented but that of IL-2 responded later. In the case of IL-4, angelan stimulated at early time after exposure but down-regulated thereafter. These results suggested that macrophages and natural killer cells involved in nonspecific immunity were primarily activated and helper T cells were secondarily affected by angelan. Angelan also had lympho-proliferative potential to B cells, specifically. The specificity of angelan was also elucidated in a cell fractionation experiment. The activated B cells by angelan also increased antibody production. The direct activation of B cells, macrophages, and accessory cells and the indirect activation of helper T cells coordinately increased immune functions such as in vitro and in vivo T-dependent immunization and antibody production. The experiment of host resistance to syngeneic tumors also showed that angelan potentiated the immune functions. In conclusion, angelan, a purified polysaccharide from an oriental herbal drug, showed characteristic immunostimulation, which was different from clinically used polysaccharides such as lentinan and PSK.
