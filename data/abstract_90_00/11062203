The in vitro activity of buforin II, cecropin P1, indolicidin, magainin II and ranalexin, alone and in combination with eight clinically used antimicrobial agents was investigated against 12 multidrug-resistant strains of Acinetobacter baumannii isolated from immunocompromised patients. Antimicrobial activities were measured by MIC, MBC and viable count. The peptides had a varied range of inhibitory values: overall, the organisms were more susceptible to buforin II (MIC range 0.25-16 mg/L), cecropin P1 (0.50-32 mg/L) and magainin II (0.50-16 mg/L). Synergy occurred when magainin II was combined with beta-lactam antibiotics.
