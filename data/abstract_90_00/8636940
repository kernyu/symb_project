A colony hybridisation method with enzyme-labelled oligonucleotide probes was developed to detect the gene for toxic shock syndrome toxin 1 (tst). For rapid identification, bacterial colonies were transferred from agar plates directly on to nylon membranes. These procedures took only 3 h. Results obtained by this test correlated well with those obtained by the reverse passive latex agglutination test. Thus, this method is convenient and reliable for the detection of tst in staphylococci, which could be useful for both research and clinical purposes. This method demonstrated that tst was more prevalent in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (56%) than in methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (4%).
