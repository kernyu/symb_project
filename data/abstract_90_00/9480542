Between December 1996 and March 1997, 95 E.coli strains were isolated from mastitis milk samples from 95 different animals. In 29.5% resistance could be observed against one or several of the examined antibiotics. However, Cefoperazone, Polymyxin B, Colistin and Gentamycin proved effective against the majority of these strains. Between 0 and 23% of E.coli were resistant against the single tested antibiotics. As opposed to earlier investigations a smaller number of Chloramphenicol-resistant strains could be found. One strain with multiple resistance was also resistant against Gentamycin. However, in the treatment of mastitis the resistance of a particular agent is only one among several contributing factors.
