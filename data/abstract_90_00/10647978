BACKGROUND: Choices of antibacterial for infections in pregnancy are limited because of potential risks to the fetus, particularly in the early months. However, infections may result in preterm labour or other problems and so treatment is needed. Increasingly, resistance is reported among common pathogens to older agents, such as ampicillin or amoxicillin, that have been widely used in pregnancy. OBJECTIVE: To assess the safety and efficacy of cefuroxime axetil in the treatment of infections during pregnancy. DESIGN: This was a retrospective analysis of case records for women who were treated with cefuroxime axetil at some point during pregnancy. SETTING: Patients were treated at one centre in Lubliniec, Poland in 1996 and 1997. PATIENTS AND PARTICIPANTS: The study included 78 women aged 19 to 38 years (mean 26 years) and their 80 infants. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES AND RESULTS: Efficacy in treating maternal infections was assessed, and the physical and mental development of children born to treated mothers was evaluated for at least 18 months after birth. 13 women were treated in the first trimester, 19 in the second trimester and 46 in the third trimester. There were no abnormalities causing concern in terms of physical or mental development in any of the children, and no abnormality that was attributable to the treatment the mother had received. CONCLUSIONS: The results add clinical support for the use of cefuroxime axetil in pregnancy if an antibacterial is needed, thus offering an alternative if antibacterial resistance to older agents is an issue for the pregnant mother.
