In order to examine antimicrobial activities of fosfomycin (FOM), the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of FOM and those of control drugs were determined against Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae isolated from sinusitis patients from September to November, 1993, and the following results were obtained. 1. Among 50 S. pneumoniae strains tested, there were 10 strains (20.0%) of benzylpenicillin (PCG)-insensitive S. pneumoniae (PISP) and 2 strains (4.0%) of PCG-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP); but the MIC distributions of FOM among the PISPs and the PRSPs were almost identical to those among the PCG-susceptible S. pneumoniae (PSSP). 2. There were 12 strains (24.0%) of beta-lactamase producing strains among 50 strains of H. influenzae tested, but the FOM's MIC distribution among these strains was almost identical to that among beta-lactamase non-producing strains. 3. The results obtained on the MIC90s of FOM against S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae suggest that the nebulization treatment with FOM nasal preparation satisfies the condition "above the MIC".
