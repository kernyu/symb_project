The utility of antifungal susceptibility testing has not been broadly determined. Thus, susceptibility testing of fungal isolates is not recommended on a routine basis. For instance, susceptibilty testing may be considered for some Candida species and for patients with Pseudallescheria boydii infections. Testing of yeasts for susceptiblity to azoles is of particular value due to their variability in response to these agents. It may also be important to test the susceptibility of new fungal organisms not previously identified or known to cause human disease because in these situations there are no clinical reports of efficacy to guide the choice of antifungal therapy.
