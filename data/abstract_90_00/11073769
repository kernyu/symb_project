We reviewed the records of 87 patients who underwent liver transplantation and who were screened by use of nasal swabs on the day before surgery. Twenty-four patients harbored methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), and 8 harbored methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). MSSA infection occurred in 3 (12.5%) of 24 MSSA carriers and in 2 (3.2%) of 63 noncarriers (nonsignificant). In contrast, MRSA infection occurred more frequently in MRSA carriers (7 [87.5%] of 8) than in MRSA noncarriers (8 [10.1%] of 79; P<.001). Nasal carriage of MRSA is associated with a very high risk of MRSA infection in liver transplant recipients.
