An animal model was used to assess the efficacy of rifampicin-impregnated, gelatin-sealed Dacron in the prevention of vascular graft infections caused by Staphylococcus epidermidis. Under a general anaesthetic an interposition graft was placed into sheep carotid artery. On completion of the operation 1 ml of normal saline containing 10(8) colony forming units (cfu) of a slime-producing S. epidermidis was inoculated directly onto the graft. After 3 weeks the graft was harvested. Swabs were taken of perigraft tissues, and of external and internal aspects of the graft. A 3-5-mm segment of the graft was incubated in broth medium and a second segment was ground for 5 min and incubated in broth medium. The presence of abscess formation and anastomotic disruption was assessed. Ten sheep received a gelatin-sealed Dacron graft (control), while nine received the same graft impregnated with rifampicin at a concentration of 1.2 mg/ml (treated). Eight of 10 control grafts were infected, with 30 of 50 possible cultures positive, compared with four of nine treatment grafts infected (P = 0.13) and 13 of 45 cultures positive (P = 0.004). The control group had four abscesses and two anastomotic disruptions; the treatment group had no abscesses (P = 0.05) or anastomotic disruptions (P = 0.26). Other organisms were isolated from nine of the 12 infected grafts, most commonly Staphylococcus aureus. There was no development of resistance to rifampicin. Rifampicin-impregnated, gelatin-sealed Dacron is successful at reducing the incidence of S. epidermidis vascular graft infection.
