We isolated 607 independent nalidixic acid-resistant mutants from Bacillus subtilis. A 163 bp DNA segment from a 5' portion of the gyrA gene was amplified from the DNA of each mutant strain. After heat denaturation, the product was subjected to gel electrophoresis to detect conformational polymorphism of single-strand DNA (PCR-SSCP analysis). Mobility patterns of the two DNA strands from all the mutant strains examined differed from those of the parental wild-type strains. The patterns were classified into 13 types, and the DNA sequence of each type was determined. A unique sequence alteration was found in mutants belonging to each of the 13 types, defining 13 gyrA alleles. Eight were single base pair substitutions, four were substitutions of two consecutive base pairs and one was a substitution of three consecutive base pairs. Only three amino acid residues (Ser-84, Ala-85, and Glu-88) were altered in the deduced amino acid sequences of the mutated genes. We conclude that molecular typing based on the PCR-SSCP method is a powerful technique for the exhaustive identification of allelic variants among mutants selected for a phenotypic trait.
