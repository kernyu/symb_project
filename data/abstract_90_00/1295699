Resistant strains of Escherichia coli were obtained by stepwise cultivation in subinhibitory concentrations of two antimicrobially active amine oxides. Changes in the chemical composition of the outer membrane of the resistant strains were accompanied also by different antigenic reactions. New precipitation lines were revealed by double immunodiffusion and immuno-electrophoretic methods. The results of immunochemical analysis confirm the findings that the resistance to amphiphilic compounds is associated with the outer membrane which limits the access of antimicrobially active molecules to their sites of action in the cytoplasmic membrane.
