Inhibitory effects of five quinolones against DNA gyrases purified from four quinolone-resistant clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and the quinolone-susceptible strain PAO1 were examined. All of the quinolone-resistant strains tested were found to be DNA gyrase mutants. The 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50s) of the quinolones for these DNA gyrases roughly correlated with their MICs. Interestingly, gyrase inhibition by DU-6859a was found to be significantly less affected by these mutations that inhibition by other currently available quinolones. To assess the enhanced activity shown by DU-6859a, the effects of quinolones with altered substituents at the N-1, C-7, and C-8 positions of the quinolone ring of DU-6859a were tested. Measurement of MICs for four DNA gyrase mutants and IC50s for their purified DNA gyrases showed that removal of the C-8 chlorine of DU-6859a significantly increased MICs and IC50s for DNA gyrase mutants. However, no deleterious effects were observed when either the fluorine on the cyclopropyl substituent at the N-1 position or the cyclopropyl ring at the C-7 substituent was removed. Moreover, removal of the C-8 chlorine also increased the MIC for 19 of 20 quinolone-resistant clinical isolates. Our results led to the conclusion that DU-6859a is much more active against quinolone-resistant clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa than other currently available quinolones, probably because of its strong inhibitory effects against mutant quinolone-resistant DNA gyrases, and that the C-8 chlorine is necessary for these potent effects.
