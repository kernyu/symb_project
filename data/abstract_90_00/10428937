The emergence of resistance in gram-positive bacteria has necessitated a search for new antimicrobial agents. Linezolid is an oxazolidinone, a new class of antibacterial agents with enhanced activity against pathogens. We compared the activity of linezolid to those of other antimicrobial agents against 3,945 clinical isolates. Linezolid demonstrated potent activity against all isolates tested. For all vancomycin-susceptible enterococci, staphylococci, and streptococci, the activity of linezolid was comparable to that of vancomycin. Against oxacillin-resistant staphylococci and vancomycin-resistant enterococci, linezolid was the most active agent tested. In summary, linezolid appears to be a promising new antimicrobial agent for the treatment of gram-positive infections.
