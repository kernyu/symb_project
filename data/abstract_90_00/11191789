Recently, three epidemics in Dutch hospitals were caused by vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). Although the number of infections was small, spread of colonization was extensive and many infection control measures were necessary to prevent further spread. VRE are relatively avirulent bacteria. However, few, if any, antibiotics are available for treatment of infections caused by VRE and the genetic code for resistance may be transferable to other, more virulent, bacteria, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Although colonization and infection with MRSA have become endemic in many surrounding countries, such a situation has been prevented in the Netherlands by employing an aggressive 'search and destroy' policy. Although many questions regarding the optimal approach of VRE remain unanswered, a similar policy as employed for MRSA will not be possible. In contrast to MRSA, colonization with VRE occurs in the open population, no populations with increased risk for colonization appear to be definable and colonization cannot be eradicated. Based on common sense, a differentiated approach seems indicated in which extensive infection control measures should only be implemented when spread of a single genotype has been demonstrated. A reference laboratory should be created for uniform genotyping.
