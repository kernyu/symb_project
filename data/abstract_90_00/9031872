The aim of this study was to identify retrospectively trends in fungal bloodstream infections in The Netherlands in the period from 1987 to 1995. Results of over 395,000 blood cultures from five Dutch university hospitals were evaluated. Overall, there were more than 12 million patient days of care during the nine-year study period. The rate of candidemia doubled in the study period, reaching an incidence of 0.71 episodes per 10,000 patient days in 1995. The general increase in candidemia was paralleled by an increase in non-Candida albicans bloodstream infections, mainly due to Candida glabrata. However, more than 60% of the infections were caused by Candida albicans. Fluconazole-resistant species such as Candida krusei did not emerge during the study period. The increasing rate of candidemia found in Dutch university hospitals is similar to the trend observed in the USA, but the rate is lower and the increase is less pronounced.
