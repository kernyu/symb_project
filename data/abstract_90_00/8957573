Following the brief information on a new malaria treatment with the fixed multiple combination Cotrifazid (rifampicin+isoniazid+sulfamethoxazole+trimethoprim) in Chemotherapy [1995;41:396-398], very good results are reported for the treatment of 61 patients with various forms of malaria. The tolerance was found to be good. Some relevant fundamental considerations (chemoresistance, synergism/antagonism, fixed multiple combination, switching from monotherapy to combination therapy) and the implementation of the principle of a "multidisease therapy' are discussed.
