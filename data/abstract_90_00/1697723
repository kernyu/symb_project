The effect of a chemically synthesized polyprenol derivative, dihydroheptaprenol (DHP), on the non-specific resistance of mice to Sendai virus infection was investigated. The mice that received 200 micrograms of DHP intranasally twice, at 3 days and 1 day before the infection, showed a significant protection against Sendai virus infection. Treatment of mice twice even with as much as 2000 micrograms of DHP through the subcutaneous route, however, had no protective effect against infection. Excess interferon and tumour necrosis factor production in intranasally DHP-treated mice was seen 1 day after the infection when compared with Sendai virus alone controls or with DHP alone controls. Variance analysis of these findings indicates a prophylactic activity of DHP in pulmonary viral infections.
