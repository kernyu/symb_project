A deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) hybridization technique was applied to in vitro drug sensitivity testing of P. falciparum using a synthetic 21-mer oligonucleotide coupled to alkaline phosphatase (PFR1-AP) to monitor development of parasite stages in culture. The density of the coloured spot clearly distinguished schizonts from ring forms. This assay system was applied in the field on Hainan Island, China. Blood samples obtained from patients were cultivated in the presence of antimalarial drugs and the minimum drug concentration required to inhibit development of parasites was determined by the DNA hybridization assay and by microscopical observation of Giemsa-stained blood smears. The 2 methods yielded identical results, indicating that the DNA hybridization assay can be used for in vitro drug sensitivity testing under field conditions.
