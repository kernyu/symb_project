The prevalence of aac(2')-Ia, a gene coding for gentamicin 2'-N-acetyltransferase in Providencia stuartii, among species of the Proteeae was investigated to determine if it is a common resistance factor and whether the correlation observed in P. stuartii between its expression and the levels of peptidoglycan O-acetylation represents a general feature of bacteria producing this form of modified peptidoglycan. An evaluation of the MICs of gentamicin for each of the species of the Proteeae did not reveal any apparent relationship between resistance and the degree of O-acetylation of peptidoglycan. The entire aac(2')-Ia gene was used as a probe in Southern hybridization experiments against genomic DNA from each species of the Proteeae. A sequence with strong homology to aac(2')-Ia was present only in Proteus penneri while weak hybridization was also observed to the restriction digested DNA from Providencia rettgeri. Other bacteria that O-acetylate peptidoglycan were also screened with this probe and a homologous DNA sequence was only found in Neisseria subflava. These data suggest that AAC(2')-Ia may contribute to the O-acetylation of peptidoglycan in P. stuartii, but a more specific enzyme must also be produced for this function.
