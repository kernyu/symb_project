Resistance to autoimmune encephalomyelitis was induced by s.c. infusion of myelin basic protein (MBP) in saline in combination with i.p. injections of anti-CD11a (LFA-1) mAbs. This treatment induces resistance to EAE induction, which appears early and persists for at least one month after treatment. Some MBP-CFA-challenged resistant rats showed minimal inflammation in the central nervous system, which was, however, confined to the meninges of the lower spinal cord. Examination of the immune status of MBP-anti-LFA-1 treated rats before encephalitogenic challenge failed to reveal any priming when assessed by Ag driven proliferation and cytokine production by lymphoid cells, and by circulating Ab production. Following challenge of protected rats, lymph node cell proliferation to MBP was unaltered, indicating that reactive cells had not been deleted or energized. Resistance could not be transferred with lymphoid cells from treated rats nor abrogated by cyclophosphamide treatment. In treated rats following challenge, there was a shift in the isotype of anti-MBP Ab produced, from an IgG2a:IgG1 ratio of 2:1 to 1:1, due to an increase in IgG1 production, indicating a possible bias towards a nonpathogenic Th2 CD4+ T cell response. The IgG1 Ab was detected early after challenge suggesting that pretreatment had indeed primed the animals, and had primed them to go down the Th2 pathway following encephalitogenic challenge. The ability to divert immune reactivity from a destructive to a nondestructive response could have important therapeutic implications for autoimmune disease.
