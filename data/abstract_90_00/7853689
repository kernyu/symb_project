Cefozopran (CZOP, SCE-2787) was given intravenously to 12 children with acute bacterial infections including 9 with acute pneumonia, 1 each with acute pyothorax, impetigo and staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome. Good or excellent clinical responses were obtained in all of the 12 patients and bacterial eradications were achieved for all 10 strains identified in these cases. No side effects were noted. Eosinophilia was observed in one case, however. From the above clinical results, it appears that CZOP is a useful antibiotic for treatment of pediatric patients with various bacterial infections.
