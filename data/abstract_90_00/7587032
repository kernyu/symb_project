Cefotaxime 2 g every 12 h was administered to adults with severe nosocomial pneumonia in a prospective noncomparative study. The results confirmed that this regimen is adequate and appropriate therapy for nosocomial pneumonia, with the combination of cefotaxime and an aminoglycoside reserved for cases where multiresistant, Gram-negative bacterial infections are strongly suspected.
