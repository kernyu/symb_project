Phagocytic and killing capacities of resident and cytokine-activated human macrophages against group B Streptococcus (GBS) type III were studied. Evidence is presented that monocyte-derived macrophages from cord and adults ingest serum-opsonized GBS but that killing of bacteria was negligible in resident cells. Treatment of adult macrophages with recombinant human gamma interferon (rhIFN-gamma; 100 U/ml) or recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (rhGM-CSF; 200 U/ml) resulted in significant increases of killing of GBS (P < 0.01 for each). The killing capacity of cord macrophages treated with rhGM-CSF was also enhanced compared to that of untreated cells (P < 0.01). However, treatment with rhIFN-gamma resulted in only a moderate increase in the capacity of cord macrophages to kill GBS (P > 0.1). These results mirrored the effect of rhIFN-gamma on candidacidal capacities of cord and adult macrophages, reported earlier from our laboratory. These data indicate differential modulation of neonatal macrophages by rhGM-CSF and rhIFN-gamma. We suggest that administration of rhGM-CSF to neonates with invasive GBS disease may enhance host resistance to these bacteria.
