A study was conducted on the in vitro activity of ampicillin/sulbactam against 100 respiratory strains of Haemophilus influenzae (45 betalactamase positive and 55 betalactamase negative strains) simultaneously isolated during 1997 in 6 Spanish hospitals: Hospital Clinico San Carlos (Madrid), Hospital de Cruces de Basurto (Bilbao), Hospital La Fe (Valencia), Hospital Virgen Macarena (Seville), Hospital de Bellvitge (Barcelona) and Hospital Clinico Universitario (Salamanca). It was studied in comparison to amoxicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, cefuroxime, clarithromycin and ciprofloxacin. The MIC breakpoints used for the interpretation of data were those published by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards in 1997. All of the strains tested were susceptible to ampicillin/sulbactam, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, cefuroxime and ciprofloxacin. The rate of resistance to clarithromycin was 55.5% for betalactamase positive strains and 38. 2% for betalactamase negative strains. A total of 23.6% of the betalactamase negative strains were resistant or showed intermediate susceptibility to amoxicillin but were susceptible to betalactam/betalactamase inhibitor combinations and cefuroxime.
