The upper small intestine is usually "sterile" in a healthy individuals, but due to some reasons the number of microorganisms may reach or increase above 10(4)/ml, leading to the contamination of the small intestine, which may cause severe malabsorption. The authors have diagnosed this syndrome in 50 children, aged between 1 month and 3 years, using breath hydrogen test and duodenal juice culture. Most of these children had growth retardation. According to their experience the authors found that the oral antibiotic is the effective treatment of this syndrome.
