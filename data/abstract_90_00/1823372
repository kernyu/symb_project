Between 1989-1989 276 strains of Acinetobacter genus were isolated which contained: Acinetobacter calcoaceticus subsp. anitratus (n = 167), Acinetobacter calcoaceticus subsp. Iwoffi (n- = 83), Acinetobacter haemolyticus (n = 26). Their sensitivity to aminoglycoside antibiotics, beta-lactams, tetracyclines, chloramphenicol, colistin, and ofloxacin was tested. More than 90% of strains were sensitive to colistin and ofloxacin. The sensitivity to remaining antibiotics differentiated depending on species. Acinetobacter anitratus were highly resistant to Ist and IInd generation of cephalosporins, and moreover to penicillins, tetracyclines, and chloramphenicol. Cephalosporins of IIIrd generation were active against 70% of strains with exception of cefoperazone what was also the case for representatives of aminoglycosides as netilmicin and amikacin. Strains of Acinetobacter Iwoffi were in majority sensitive to all antibiotics with exception of cephalothin, cephradine and cefoperazone. More than 90% of Acinetobacter haemolyticus strains were sensitive to gentamicin, carbenicillin, azlocillin, ceftriaxone, cefotaxime and tetracyclines.
