gyrA point mutations in 335 clinical Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates were examined mainly by nonisotopic single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis and direct sequencing. Seven types of missense gyrA mutations were observed in 70 of 335 strains (20.9%), and ciprofloxacin MICs were > or = 3.13 micrograms/ml for 63 of 70 strains (90.0%). These included two double point mutations and three novel mutations (Ala-67-->Ser plus Asp-87-->Gly, Ala-84-->Pro, and Gln-106-->Leu). Thr-83-->Ile mutants were predominantly observed (63 of 70 mutants) and showed high-level fluoroquinolone resistance (ciprofloxacin MIC at which 50% of isolates are inhibited, 25 micrograms/ml).
