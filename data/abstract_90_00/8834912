Tcr Emr 7853, from Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron 7853, is a large chromosomal conjugative transposon which encodes resistance to both tetracycline (Tcr) and erythromycin (Emr). The erythromycin resistance gene of Tcr Emr 7853 did not cross-hybridize with ermF, the Emr gene found on previously studied Bacteroides regular and conjugative transposons. We have cloned and sequenced the erythromycin resistance gene from Tcr Emr 7853. The DNA sequence of this gene was 99.6% identical to that of ermG from Bacillus sphaericus.
