We report the case of a patient who complained of arthralgias and arthritis 1 month before the onset of fever or other signs of infective endocarditis. In 2 months she developed an additive, asymmetrical polyarthritis with fever (febrile polyarthritis). Splenomegaly was present. Two-dimensional echocardiography showed no vegetations or other findings suggesting endocardial involvement. Initially, four blood cultures showed no microorganisms, then six of nine subsequent blood cultures grew highly gentamicin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis.
