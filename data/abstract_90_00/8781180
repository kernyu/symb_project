Unlike most polymorphic markers in the Chlamydomonas eugametos and Chlamydomonas moewusii chloroplast DNAs (cpDNAs), the C. moewusii 6- and 21-kb extra sequences and the C. eugametos-specific CeLSU small middle dot 5 intron are transmitted to all of the few viable progeny in reciprocal crosses between the two green algae. To determine whether this unidirectional transmission pattern is due to gene conversion or to selection for F1 hybrid survival, we followed the inheritance of the parental alleles at the loci featuring these three deletions/additions and at several other polymorphic cpDNA loci in zygospore clones derived from high-viability crosses. The great majority of the zygospore clones examined inherited exclusively the long alleles from the mt- parent at the loci containing the three optional cpDNA elements, but as expected, they preferentially inherited the markers from the mt+ parent at most other loci. Our results therefore indicate that all three optional cpDNA sequences propagate themselves very efficiently by gene conversion in crosses between strains differing by the presence of these elements. The co-conversion tracts associated with these sequences are longer (>3 kb) than those previously reported for mobile elements spreading by gene conversion. Our results also revealed that less efficient gene conversion events occurred at two other cpDNA loci.
