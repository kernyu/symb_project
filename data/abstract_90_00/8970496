BACKGROUND: Outbreaks of multi-drug resistant Staphylococcus aureus over eight years were investigated to prevent future endemic. METHODS: Isolates of multiresistant S. aureus underwent a cluster analysis combined with canonical discriminant analysis using bacteriologic biotyping and sensitivity to 21 drugs. RESULTS: Of a total of 786 strains recovered from 155 in-patients, the specialty surgical ward (SW) exhibited 470 isolates (59.8%) and the general SW 214 (27.2%). Among six clusters formed, four clusters were predominant in the general SW. An ordination diagram from the canonical discriminant analysis revealed a distribution in which clusters were localized temporally (year) and spatially (ward). A yearly shift of clusters indicated emergence of a new phenotype of multiresistant S. aureus. CONCLUSIONS: The cluster analysis of isolates of multiresistant S. aureus using biotyping and sensitivity may supplement the classical method of tracing the spreading patterns of this microbe.
