The effect of experimental myocardial infarction on endothelium-dependent relaxation of isolated rat aorta and generation of nitric oxide in the aortic wall was studied. Three hours following myocardial infarction, the endothelium-dependent relaxation induced with acetylcholine was increased to 61 +/- 2% as compared with 41 +/- 4% in control (r < 0.05). The nitric oxide generation (EPR-assay) was 2.5 times increased in the aortic wall of animals subjected to myocardial infarction as compared with the control. The activated generation of nitric oxide may be provoked by the reduced minute volume of the heart and concomitant transient hypovolemia.
