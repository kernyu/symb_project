To determine the tissue localization of insulin resistance in type 1 diabetic patients, whole body and regional glucose uptake rates were determined under euglycemic hyperinsulinemic conditions. Leg, arm, and heart glucose uptake rates were measured using positron emission tomography-derived 2-deoxy-2-[18F]-fluoro-D-glucose kinetics and the three-compartment model described by Sokoloff et al. (L. Sokoloff, M. Reivich, C. Kennedy, M.C. DesRosiers, C.S. Patlak, K.D. Pettigrew, O. Sakurada, and M. Shinohara. J. Neurochem. 28: 897-916, 1977) in eight type 1 diabetic patients and eight matched normal subjects. Whole body glucose uptake was quantitated by the euglycemic insulin clamp technique. Whole body glucose uptake was approximately 31% lower in the diabetic patients (P < 0.01) than in the normal subjects, thus confirming the presence of whole body insulin resistance. The rate of glucose uptake was approximately 45% lower in leg muscle when measured in the femoral region (55 +/- 7 vs. 102 +/- 13 mumol.kg muscle-1.min-1, diabetic patients vs. normal subjects, P < 0.05) and approximately 27% lower in the arm muscles (66 +/- 4 vs. 90 +/- 13 mumol.kg muscle-1.min-1, respectively, P < 0.05), whereas no difference was observed in heart glucose uptake [789 +/- 80 vs. 763 +/- 58 mumol.kg muscle-1.min-1 not significant (NS)]. Whole body glucose uptake correlated with glucose uptake in femoral (r = 0.93, P < 0.005) and arm muscles (r = 0.66, P < 0.05) but not with glucose uptake in the heart (r = 0.04, NS). We conclude that insulin resistance in type 1 diabetic patients is localized to skeletal muscle, whereas heart glucose uptake is unaffected.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
