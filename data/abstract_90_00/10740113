We report a case of Candida albicans fungemia complicated by a pulmonary localization in a non-immunocompromised patient. Complete recovery was obtained after a long course of high-dose fluconazole in spite of in vitro resistance of the Candida to fluconazole. The usefulness of fluconazole therapy, the best dosage regimen and the in vitro and in vivo correlations are discussed.
