Blood was collected from two Sahelian goats, experimentally infected with either a drug-sensitive cloned population of Trypanosoma congolense (IL 1180) or a multiple drug-resistant T. congolense stock (Samorogouan/89/CRTA/267) and incubated at 37 degrees C for 30 min and 12 h, respectively, in the presence of different drug concentrations (0.5, 1.0, 10.0 and 100.0 microg/ml blood) of diminazene aceturate or isometamidium chloride. After that, the trypanosome/blood/drug suspensions were offered to tsetse flies (2100 teneral Glossina morsitans submorsitans) through an in vitro feeding system, using a silicone membrane. All tsetse flies were dissected and examined for the presence of trypanosomes in labrum, hypopharynx and midgut 20 days after their infective blood-meals. Infectivity of the drug-sensitive cloned population was already completely abolished after incubation with 0.5 microg/ml of both drugs; however, 13.6-42.2% of tsetse having been fed on untreated blood had developed an infection. In contrast, no significant differences were observed in the infection rates between the experimental groups and their control groups when fed on blood infected with the multiple drug-resistant stock after incubation for 30 min with up to 10 microg/ml of diminazene or isometamidium. In consequence, tsetse appear to be a useful tool in the assessment of drug susceptibility of typanosome populations.
