Enterococci are persistent organisms naturally occurring in the digestive tract, able to persist on environmental surfaces for days or weeks, surviving heat and desiccation. They are the second most common bacterial cause of nosocomial infection. Recent strains of enterococci resistant to vancomycin pose a serious health hazard to hospitalized, institutionalized, and immunocompromised patients. This article presents a case study of community-acquired vancomycin-resistant enterococcus in an otherwise healthy child and suggests strategies for management and containment in the community.
