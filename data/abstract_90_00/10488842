Food borne microorganisms display a broad spectrum of resistance responses to naturally occurring and intentionally added antimicrobial agents. Resistance may be conferred by innate structural features of the bacterial strain such as an impermeable outer membrane or a mechanism for antibiotic-inactivation. Bacteria previously susceptible to an antimicrobial compound can acquire resistance through mutation or through genetic transfer processes such as transformation, transduction, and conjugation. Resistance can also be conferred by biofilm formation on food processing surfaces as an adaptive response to protect colonies from cleaning and sanitation. Resistant pathogens are a global problem, facilitated by international trade of raw and processed foods. Cross resistance between clinical and nonclinical antimicrobials can exist and is of concern. The development of resistant foodborne pathogens has been attributed to increased antibiotic use in hospitals, outpatient facilities, and veterinary applications. Resistant microorganisms can also develop as a result of physical processes used in food preservation, such as acid treatments and irradiation processes. Strategies to effectively counter resistance development include: changing current practices of antibiotic usage, developing new antibiotics, applying hurdle preservation approaches, preventing bacterial adhesion, and utilizing competitive exclusion. This paper presents an overview of problems arising from the development of microbial resistance, and explores possible solutions for detecting and defeating the adaptive changes of microorganisms.
