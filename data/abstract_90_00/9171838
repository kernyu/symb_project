Over a 6-year period, we studied 791 patients with multidrug-resistant typhoid fever, of whom 665 individuals (84%) developed neuropsychiatric manifestations. These were: acute confusional state (73%); myelitis (6%); cerebellitis (1%); parkinsonism (1%); acute psychosis (0.6%); meningo-encephalitis (0.5%); encephalitis (0.25%); sensory motor polyneuropathy, polymyositis, acute schizophrenia and bizarre neurological syndromes (0.12% each). Severe parkinsonian rigidity and meningo-encephalitis are associated with significant morbidity but very low mortality (0.5%).
