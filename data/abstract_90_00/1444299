Capnocytophaga species have been associated with a wide variety of infections in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients. On the basis of data from antimicrobial susceptibility studies, beta-lactam antibiotics have been considered efficacious therapy. Six of 19 isolates from primarily clinical sources across Canada demonstrated beta-lactamase production, and agar dilution susceptibility testing showed broad resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics. For the beta-lactamase producing isolates, clavulanate reduced the MIC of amoxicillin for 90% of the strains tested by 64-fold. Isolates were highly susceptible to clindamycin, imipenem, and ciprofloxacin. Characterization of the beta-lactamases produced by two of these isolates (Van1 and Van2) was performed. Isoelectric focusing revealed an identical isoelectric point of 5.6 for both enzymes, but they had markedly different relative hydrolysis efficiencies, and different conditions were required to extract the enzymes. This study demonstrates the production of different types of beta-lactamases by Capnocytophaga spp. and suggests the need to screen all clinical isolates of Capnocytophaga spp. for the presence of beta-lactamases.
