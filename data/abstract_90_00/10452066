OBJECTIVE: To investigate bacterial resistance to antimicrobial agents in the background of extensive employment of third-generation cephalosporins in the treatment of burn infection. METHODS: Bacterial susceptibility testing was carried out using Kirby-Bauer method. RESULTS: Out of 259 Gram negative bacilli isolates, 31% of these strains were all resistant to cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, cefoperazone and ceftazidime. In vitro test, susceptibility of 52% third-generation cephlosporins resistant strains were restored by cefoperazone/sulbactum. 23.8% of P. aeruginosa were resistant to imipenem, 51.2% to ciprofloxacin. 28.6% of A. anitratum were resistant to imipenem, 21.4% to ciprofloxacin. 9.9% of enterobacteriaceae were resistant to imipenem, 20.4% to ciprofloxacin. 26.9% of MRSA were resistant to imipenem, 73% to ciprofloxacin. No norvancomycin resistance was detected. 2.7% of E. faecalis were resistant to norvancomycin. CONCLUSION: It is likely that the observed resistance to third-generation cephalosporins may be partially due to chromosome-mediated type-1 beta- lactamase.
