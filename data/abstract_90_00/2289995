Patients undergoing an esophageal resection because of carcinoma are at risk of developing postoperative respiratory tract infections. These patients were studied with respect to preceding colonisation with gram-negative bacilli and the effect of selective decontamination (SD) in decreasing this phenomenon, thereby reducing gram-negative infections. We randomised prospectively 114 patients into a test group receiving SD-medication (n = 56) and a control group receiving conventional prophylaxis. Postoperatively, all patients were admitted to the intensive care unit and mechanically ventilated. The preoperative administration of SD-medication resulted in adequate decontamination within 3-4 days in most patients, and SD could prevent gram-negative colonisation and infections effectively. Discontinuation of SD showed gram-negative (re-)colonisation, and resulted in 12 infections in 4 patients having late complications. This indicates that prolonged use in these patients might be beneficial. This new antibiotic prophylaxis proved effective, without causing an increase in bacterial resistance.
