Conjugation, as a process of gene recombination where R-plasmids are transferred from resistant to sensitive genera of bacteria, is very important in the onset and development of infective multiple resistance to the bacterial division potential, whereas it enables fast spreading of resistant genera in the human population. Problems in regard to etiologic therapy of intestinal infections are most serious in shigellosis which is shown in our results of examining 450 genera of Shigella-sonnei isolated during the period January 1990-December 1994. Thus, resistance to ampicillin occurs in 99.4%, while resistance to streptomycin and cotrimoxazole occurs in 94%. Results of gene resistance transmission from Shigella-sonnei genera, potential donors into recipients by conjugation in vitro, show high frequency of transfer to ampicillin which points to the fact that it is determined by plasmids and transposons-mobile extrachromosomal gene structure. Similar results are gained by multiple-resistant genera of Salmonella wien. However, the stereotype which is dominant in our region and which makes more than 70% of all isolated salmonellas, Salmonella enteritidis is still sensitive to all most commonly used antimicrobial drugs. On the basis of gathered results it may be concluded that the antibiotics of choice in the etiologic therapy of intestinal infections are quinolone-norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin because the resistance which may occur is chromosomally determined.
