24 patients (4-65 years old; median age 29 years) excreting shigella bacteria greater than 8 weeks were treated with the combination pivampicillin (0.25 g)/pivmecillinam (0.20 g), 2 tablets 3 times a day for 14 days. 23/24 patients (96%) were culture negative after treatment. The one patient that did not respond to treatment carried a strain with intermediate sensitivity to mecillinam and resistance to ampicillin. It is concluded that pivampicillin/pivmecillinam is effective for patients excreting shigella bacteria.
