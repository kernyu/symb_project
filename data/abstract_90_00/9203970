It is believed that self-reactive forbidden T-cell clones are generated by 'failure' of the pathway of T-cell differentiation in the thymus, if it is disturbed. We examined how such forbidden clones are generated under immunosuppressive conditions. Mice were treated with an injection of deoxyspergualin, FK506, or cycloporin A. From day 3, the number of cells yielded by various organs decreased. Because of the resistance of intermediate (int) T-cell receptor (TCR) cells (i.e. TCRint cells), they became more prominent in proportion than TCRhigh cells. TCRhigh cells are conventional T cells generated through the mainstream in the thymus, whereas TCRint cells are primordial T cells generated by the extrathymic pathway or an alternative intrathymic pathway. Similar to untreated mice, forbidden V beta 3+ and V beta 11+ clones in C3H/He (Mls-1b2a) mice were confined to TCRint cells after treatment; there was no leakage of forbidden clones into TCRhigh cells in the thymus and periphery. In parallel with the increase in the proportion of TCRint cells, the proportion of forbidden clones also increased under immunosuppressive states, especially in the liver. Liver mononuclear cells isolated from treated mice still had the potential to mediate autologous killing. The present results suggest that the generation of self-reactive clones is highly restricted to the pathways of TCRint cell differentiation even under immunosuppressive conditions.
