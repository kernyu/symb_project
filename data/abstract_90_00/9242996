Phenotypic and molecular techniques, including antimicrobial susceptibility testing, plasmid analysis, and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) were used to characterize 15 isolates of multidrug-resistant (MDR) Salmonella anatum cultured during a 16 mo period from horses and a veterinary clinic environment. The isolates were resistant to multiple antimicrobial agents and could be placed into 4 groups based on their antimicrobial resistance patterns. The isolates contained multiple plasmids ranging in size from 2 to > 100 kb that could be grouped into 3 different plasmid profile patterns; these patterns did not correlate with the antimicrobial resistance groupings. Furthermore, antimicrobial resistance was conjugatively transferable. Digestion of genomic DNA from the 15 isolates with 3 different restriction endonucleases, SfiI, SpeI, and XbaI followed by PFGE revealed a highly conserved restriction endonuclease digestion pattern. In contrast, diverse banding patterns were observed with S. anatum obtained from other sources. These observations suggest that the MDR S. anatum isolates represent a common outbreak strain even though they possess different, albeit similar, antibiograms and plasmid profiles. The study showed that PFGE is a useful epidemiological tool for discriminating between unrelated and outbreak-related strains of S. anatum. In conclusion, epidemiological studies of outbreaks caused by MDR isolates of S. anatum should consist of both genotypic and phenotypic methods of analysis.
