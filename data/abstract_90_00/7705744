We are developing methods for somatic cell gene therapy directed against infection with human immunodeficiency virus by enhancing the antiviral resistance of target cells through the constitutive production of interferon-beta. Cells that have been transformed by plasmids or retroviral vectors carrying the human interferon-beta gene placed under the expression control of a murine H2Kb promoter fragment become resistant to HIV infection. Part of this enhanced resistance is due to inhibition of virus entry into the transformed cells, a hitherto unreported mechanism of interferon action.
