BACKGROUND: The aim of our study was to test the feasibility of culturing Helicobacter pylori directly from biopsies aimed for rapid urease test in routine clinical practice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 260 consecutive patients referred for gastroscopy because of dyspepsia one antral biopsy was routinely used for our "in house" rapid urease test (RUT). Positive biopsies were placed in a transport medium and sent to the laboratory. The biopsies were cultured and incubated at 37 degrees C for 5-7 days. H. pylori was identified and routinely tested for antimicrobial resistance by using the E-test. RESULTS: In 118 out of 260 patients (45%) the urease test turned positive and the growth of H. pylori was sufficient to allow testing of antimicrobial resistance. CONCLUSION: H. pylori could be cultured from almost all positive RUT specimens. A liquid RUT is thus more suitable for culture, saving additional biopsies.
