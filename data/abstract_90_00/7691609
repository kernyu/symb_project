CD59 (protectin) is an 18-20-kDa inhibitor of the membrane attack complex of complement. It protects homologous cells from complement-mediated damage and has been shown to be present on the endothelial cell membranes both in vitro and in vivo. In this study we observed that the surface expression of CD59 on the cultured EA.hy 926 endothelial cell line can be up-regulated to an approximately threefold higher level after a 72-h stimulation by the protein kinase C inducers phorbol-12-myristate-13 acetate (PMA; 10 nM) and calcium ionophore, A23187 (100 nM). Similarly, an increase in the level of CD59 expression was seen by the protein kinase A inducer dibutyryl-cyclic adenosine monophosphate. In Northern blot analysis increases were observed in CD59 mRNA expression, particularly in the level of the longest 1.9-kb, 2.1-kb and 5.8-kb transcripts. A functional significance for the increased CD59 expression was implied by an observed increased resistance of the PMA-stimulated EA.hy 926 cells to complement-mediated cell lysis.
