In this paper, we describe an approach to support physicians when they select a calculated antibiotic therapy for intensive care patients who have developed an infection as an additional complication. As advice is needed quickly and the pathogen is not yet known, we use an expected pathogen spectrum based on medical background knowledge and known resistances, which both will be adapted to the results of the laboratory. Case-Based Reasoning retrieval methods provide the advice for similar previous patients. Their solutions are adapted to be applicable to the new medical situation of the current patient. Furthermore, we present the recent resistance developments of the antibiotics to the physician.
