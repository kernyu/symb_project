Dactamicin is a new member of the pseudo-disaccharide group of antibiotics. It is structurally close to astromicin. Dactimicin is active against a wide variety of bacteria, including resistant strains with aminoglycoside-inactivating enzymes. Isepamicin is a broad-spectrum aminoglycoside, a derivative of gentamicin B. It is also active against many aminoglycoside-resistant strains. In a series of gram-negative bacterial isolates from various Czecho-Slovak regions, in vitro investigation yielded a good activity of dactimicin and isepamicin against amikacin- and gentamicin-resistant strains producing the enzyme AAC/6'/ or a combination of AAC/6'/ + ANT/2"/ enzymes. Dactimicin was not effective against strains producing the enzyme AAC/3/-I, and isepamicin was not effective or only slightly effective against bacterial isolates producing a combination of AAC/6'/ + AAC/3/ enzymes.
