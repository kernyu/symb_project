The sensitivity of Y. pseudotuberculosis of different origin and plasmid profile to Russian preparations of the ftoroquinolones group (cyprofloxacin, pefloxacin, norfloxacin) was studied. Of the 3 preparations under study, pefloxacin was found to be most active with respect to Y. pseudotuberculosis. The absence of relationship between antibiotic resistance in 4 Y. pseudotuberculosis strains to cyprofloxacin, pefloxacin and norfloxacin and their additional conjugative R-plasmid with molecular weights of 32 and 38 mD was noted. Pefloxacin was shown to give a good sanitation and protective effect in experimental pseudotuberculosis.
