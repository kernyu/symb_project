The surveillance of sensitivity of P. falciparum to pyronaridine/sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine has been carried out in Diaoluo area in Hainan Province where chloroquine-resistant falciparum malaria is endemic, covering an area of 406 square kilometers, with a population of 3745 in 1986. From 1986 all outpatients diagnosed as falciparum malaria were administered with PND/S/P as the only antimalarial. In vivo sensitivity of P. falciparum was measured in some patients who were treated in hospital. It was demonstrated that P. falciparum in the Diaoluo area has retained its sensitivity to a single oral dose of PND/S/P of 500/1,000/50 mg with 100% cure rate for at least 5 years.
