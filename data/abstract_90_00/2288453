The virucidal activity of 8 disinfectants was analyzed towards 3 groups of viruses responsible for diseases in animals (pneumovirus, coronavirus, parvovirus). Whether organic matter is present or not, parvoviruses are the most resistant, since concentrations of disinfectants 20-500 times higher than those inactivating coronaviruses and pneumoviruses must used. When organic matters are present the activity of disinfectant is considerably reduced. Among the products tested, 0.8% soda and sodium hypochlorite with 1 degree chlorometric were the most active.
