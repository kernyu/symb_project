Multidrug resistance (MDR), caused by the overexpression of two membrane proteins, MDR1-Pgp and/or MRP, is a major obstacle in the chemotherapy of cancer. The proper laboratory diagnosis of clinical multidrug resistance is still an unresolved question, and this uncertainty, in a vicious cycle, does not allow the correct evaluation of the clinical relevance of the MDR phenomenon. More-over, inefficient MDR diagnostics hinders the development of effective resistance-modulation strategies. In this review, after describing the basic features of the MDR drug pump proteins, the currently employed diagnostic methods are discussed. We suggest that a quantitative, functional method developed in our laboratory may provide a major help in the laboratory assessment of cancer MDR.
