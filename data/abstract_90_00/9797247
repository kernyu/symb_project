The susceptibilities of 143 Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, and Prevotella nigrescens isolates to 18 antimicrobial agents were tested. All P. gingivalis isolates were susceptible. In contrast, some Prevotella spp. (17%) were resistant to beta-lactams, erythromycin, clindamycin, or tetracycline and carried resistance genes, ermF or tetQ, or beta-lactamases.
