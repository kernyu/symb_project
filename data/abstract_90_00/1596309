1. Human lactoferrin and transferrin are capable of binding several transition metal ions [Fe(III), Cu(II), Mn(III), Co(III)] into specific binding sites in the presence of bicarbonate. 2. Increased conformational stability and increased resistance to protein unfolding is observed for these metal-ion complexes compared to the apoprotein form of these proteins. 3. Mn(III)-lactoferrin and transferrin complexes exhibit steeper denaturation transitions than the Co(III) complexes of these proteins suggesting greater cooperativity in the unfolding process. 4. The incorporation of Fe(III) into the specific metal binding sites offers the greatest resistance to thermal unfolding when compared to the other transition metal ions studied. 5. Non-coincidence of unfolding transitions is observed, with fluorescence transition midpoints being lower than those determined by absorbance measurements. 6. Fully denatured proteins in the presence of urea and alkyl ureas exhibit fluorescence wavelength maxima at 355-356 nm indicative of tryptophan exposure upon protein unfolding.
