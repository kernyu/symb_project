The virulence plasmid pYVe of Yersinia enterocolitica codes for the production of the outer membrane protein YadA and the secretion of several proteins, called Yops, which may protect this bacterium against killing by human granulocytes. Granulocytes kill ingested microorganisms by oxygen-dependent and oxygen-independent mechanisms, the latter including antimicrobial polypeptides. The aim of this study was to determine whether virulent (pYVe+) Y. enterocolitica and plasmid-cured avirulent (pYVe-) Y. enterocolitica differ in susceptibility to antimicrobial polypeptides extracted from granules of human granulocytes. The acetic acid granule extract contained several polypeptides with antimicrobial activity against Y. enterocolitica as determined by gel overlay and radial diffusion assays. Two of these polypeptides were identified as lysozyme and defensins. pYVe+ Y. enterocolitica was less susceptible than pYVe- Y. enterocolitica to the antimicrobial activity of granule extract, lysozyme, and defensins as determined in a suspension assay, which indicated that the pYVe plasmid mediates a reduced susceptibility to these polypeptides. The role of YadA in the resistance to antimicrobial polypeptides was analyzed by using mutants of Y. enterocolitica that specifically lack or express YadA. The results demonstrated that YadA conferred resistance to the killing of Y. enterocolitica by the granule extract. Together, these results indicate that the plasmid-encoded factor YadA contributes to the resistance of Y. enterocolitica to the killing by antimicrobial polypeptides of human granulocytes.
