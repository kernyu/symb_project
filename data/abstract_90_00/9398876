BACKGROUND: To refine our understanding of anti-Helicobacter pylori treatment regimens further, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of lansoprazole given in combination with clarithromycin and metronidazole for 7 days in an open-label, multicenter study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: H. pylori-positive patients self-administered lansoprazole, 30 mg; clarithromycin, 500 mg; and metronidazole, 500 mg bid for 7 days. Patients were assessed at pretreatment, at which time the presence of H. pylori was documented by rapid urease test or histology and culture, following study drug administration (week 1) for a brief evaluation only, and at least 4 weeks posttreatment (week 5), including endoscopy with collection of biopsy specimens for culture and histology testing. RESULTS: Of the 60 patients enrolled in the study, 59 had confirmed H. pylori infection, and 51 were included in an intent-to-treat analysis of efficacy. Primary metronidazole and clarithromycin resistance were observed in 84% and 8% of study patients, respectively. One month after the end of therapy, H. pylori infection was cured in 40 of 51 patients (78%); 95% confidence interval, (65%-89%). The triple-therapy regimen was well-tolerated, with only 2 patients (4%) requiring premature withdrawal from the study due to treatment-related adverse events. Taste perversion (15.0%) and diarrhea (11.7%) were the most frequently reported adverse events possibly or probably related to study medication during the treatment period. CONCLUSION: Despite a high prevalence of metronidazole resistance, a 1-week, triple-drug combination of lansoprazole, clarithromycin, and metronidazole is effective treatment for and well-tolerated by patients with H. pylori infection.
