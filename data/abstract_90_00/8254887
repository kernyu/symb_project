Bacteria clinically isolated from patients of otitis media and otitis externa were collected from various medical facilities across Japan during years 1988, 1990 and 1992, and minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of cefmenoxime and of reference drugs were determined against these strains. A comparative analyses of the obtained results revealed some trends described below. 1. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), multiple drug resistant Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) and multiple drug resistant Proteus spp. showed a year to year trend toward a steady increasing. Relative frequencies of occurrence of MRSA in these years, however, remained comparable to that of early 1980's. 2. A year to year trend toward increasing was also found for resistant or insensitive Streptococcus pneumoniae to penicillins and cephems. 3. Multiple drug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains were also detected but they showed no trend toward increasing.
