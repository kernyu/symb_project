Rifamethoprim is a new formulation containing rifampicin and trimethoprim. Its efficacy was studied in the treatment of a group of patients with various nonspecific diseases of the lungs. It was shown to be highly active against a broad spectrum of pathogens. With inclusion of trimethoprim to the formulation it appeared possible to markedly lower the bacterial ability to develop resistance to rifampicin, which solved the problem of long-term antibiotic use. The unique pharmacokinetic properties of rifampicin such as its capacity to penetrating into the sputum, lung tissues and cells make rifamethoprim be the drug of optimal choice in the treatment of respiratory diseases.
