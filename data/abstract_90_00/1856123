A survey of 2036 strains of Escherichia coli was conducted in Oporto, Portugal, to establish the prevalence of resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics. Isolates were from hospital and clinical practice patients, and were further divided into urinary and non-urinary pathogens. A high level of resistance to aminopenicillins (55.3%) was observed. Further examination of the resistant strains showed that the frequencies of occurrence of known beta-lactamases were as follows: TEM-1 (78.2% of resistant strains); SHV-1 (7.9%); TEM-2 (0.45%); OXA-1 (1.5%); HMS-1 (0.18%); TEM-1 + SHV-1 (4.2%). Other pairs of beta-lactamases were also identified in less than 2% of the resistant strains. In addition, 4.7% of the resistant strains produced elevated levels of a presumed chromosomal cephalosporinase, while 0.9% produced a ceftazimidase of pI 5.8-5.9 which was similar to TEM-6.
