Studies were carried out on the clinical efficacy of panipenem/betamipron (PAPM/BP) against bacterial infections. The results are summarized as follows: 1. PAPM/BP were administered to total 21 patients (7 cases of pneumonia, 1 case of bronchitis, 3 cases of cellulitis, 2 cases of purulent lymphadenitis, 2 cases of otitis media, 1 case of purulent parotitis, 1 case of sinusitis, 1 case of mastoiditis, 2 cases of urinary tract infection and 1 case of purulent meningitis) by drip intravenous injection. 2. Clinical responses of PAPM/BP were excellent in 12 cases, good in 7, poor in 1 and unknown in 1 case. The overall efficacy rate was 95.0%. 3. Concentration of PAPM in cerebrospinal fluid after 1 hour drip intravenous administration in 1 case of purulent meningitis were 6.84 micrograms/ml at the acute stage and 3.28 micrograms/ml at the recovering stage. 4. Neither side effects nor abnormal laboratory findings were observed except 1 case of increase of thrombocytosis out of 19 cases. 5. From the results, PAPM/BP was determined to be an efficacious and safe drug for the therapy of pediatric infection.
