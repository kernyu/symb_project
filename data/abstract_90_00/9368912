The combined effects of the uterine infusion of EDTA-Tris solution and antibiotics have been evaluated in 75 cases of slight, moderate or severe bovine endometritis which did not respond to local routine antimicrobial therapy. Antibiotic-resistant bacteria were isolated from uterine swabs. The cows were divided into three groups on the basis of the severity of endometritis and treated with 100 ml of sterile EDTA-Tris solution (250 mM EDTA and 50 mM tris, pH 8) and the same antibiotic used in the first unsuccessful treatment (oxytetracycline, enrofloxacin, lincomycin-spectinomycin or amikacin). Control groups consisting of six animals treated with antibiotic alone were used. Clinical evaluations performed 2, 15, 21, 42 and 63 days after treatment revealed good therapeutic results, as 53 cows showed a complete recovery with renormalization of the subsequent oestrus cycle. Artificial insemination was followed by pregnancy in about 90% of treated cows. In control animals the second treatment performed using only the antibiotic gave variable and unsatisfactory results, particularly in animals affected by severe endometritis.
