We have been investigating the synergistic cytotoxic interactions between tamoxifen (TAM) and cisplatin (DDP) in human malignant cell lines. Recent data have demonstrated that TAM activates phospholipase D, which can increase the production of prostaglandin D2. Prostaglandin D2 has been shown to have growth inhibitory properties in several malignant cell lines. delta 12-Prostaglandin-J2 (delta 12-PG J2) is a derivative of prostaglandin D2 that has been shown to have similar inhibitory properties. We hypothesized that TAM may increase the production of delta 12-PG J2, which in turn may synergize with DDP. To begin our investigation of this interaction, we sought to determine if delta 12-PG J2 was cytotoxic and synergistic in our melanoma system and then expanded our observations to include a wide range of malignant cells. We have demonstrated that delta 12-PG J2 is cytotoxic to multiple malignant cell lines including melanoma, ovarian, prostate, colon, pancreas, small cell lung cancer, and breast cancer lines. The IC50s ranged from 0.70 microM (small cell lung cancer) to 3.30 microM (DDP-resistant melanoma). Additionally, delta 12-PG J2 exhibited synergistic cytotoxicity with both DDP and ionizing radiation. These data suggest that delta 12-PG J2 should be further evaluated in an in vivo model to confirm activity.
