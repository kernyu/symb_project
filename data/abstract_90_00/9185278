The in vitro inhibitory action of teicoplanin, vancomycin, metronidazole and clindamycin against clinical isolates of Clostridium difficile was investigated. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined using E test. Teicoplanin (MIC range 0.023-0.75 microgram/ml), vancomycin (MIC range 0.5-3 micrograms/ml) and metronidazole (MIC range 0.19-1 microgram/ml) were all very active against the isolates examined. No resistant strains of C. difficile to those three antimicrobial agents were observed, whereas resistance to clindamycin was found in 39.5% of the tested strains. Teicoplanin was about 4-times more potent than vancomycin. It appears to be a more promising antimicrobial for treatment of C. difficile enteric disease.
