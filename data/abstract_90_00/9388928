In an in vitro culture system of human cancer cells MCF-7 and its adriamycin-resistant line MCF-7/Ad or KB and its vincristine-resistant line KBv200, tetrandrine was found to exhibit significantly selective anticancer activity against the drug-resistant cancer cell MCF-7/Ad. In addition, essentially complete reversal effects of tetrandrine on drug resistance were observed in MCF/Ad or KBv200.
