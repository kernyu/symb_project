Forty-two subjects travelling to Mexico for 11 days were enrolled in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial comparing ciprofloxacin 250 mg twice daily for three days or placebo for treatment of travellers' diarrhoea. Seventeen (41%) subjects were randomized to treatment. By the last treatment day, all seven evaluable subjects in the ciprofloxacin group, and three of eight evaluable subjects in the placebo group were cured (P = 0.04). The mean time to cure was 26 h for ciprofloxacin and 60 h for placebo-treated patients (P = 0.03). Faecal specimen were collected pre-travel, after four days in Mexico, 48 h post-travel and four weeks post-travel. Potentially pathogenic Escherichia coli strains carrying diarrhoeagenic virulence genes were detected by DNA hybridization tests, during or after travel, in 41% of treated and 31% of asymptomatic travellers. Travel, irrespective of diarrhoea and type of treatment, had a minor impact on the aerobic and anaerobic microflora. In travellers with ongoing diarrhoea, a suppression of the numbers of anaerobic bacteria was found, but the microflora was otherwise virtually unaffected. Significantly increased frequencies of E. coli resistant to ampicillin, doxycycline, chloramphenicol and co-trimoxazole were found during and after travel in all categories of travellers, though more frequently in subjects who experienced diarrhoea. The susceptibility of Bacteroides spp. remained unchanged. The sensitivity of E. coli to ciprofloxacin was not affected by travel, except in four ciprofloxacin-treated subjects who acquired multiresistant E. coli with ciprofloxacin MICs of > or = 0.125 mg/L post-travel. Bacteroides strains with MICs of > or = 64 mg/L were isolated post-travel from four ciprofloxacin-treated patients, and from one of the other 34 travellers not treated with ciprofloxacin.
