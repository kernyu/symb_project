Several significant advances in the understanding of the catalytic mechanisms, structures and evolution of glutathione transferases have occurred in the past year. These advances include new mechanistic information concerning the canonical soluble enzymes, the finding that the fosfomycin-specific enzyme, FosA, is a metalloglutathione transferase and a higher resolution projection structure of the microsomal enzyme.
