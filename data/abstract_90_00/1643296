This retrospective study was undertaken to determine the prevalence and pattern of resistance to antituberculosis drugs among patients with sputum-proven pulmonary tuberculosis who were seen in Taif Chest Hospital over 24 months (between June 1986 and May 1988). The overall prevalence was 22.6% and the majority (53%) were resistant to two drugs. Resistance to streptomycin was most frequent (16%) followed by rifampicin (15%). Resistance to isoniazid was surprisingly low (6.5%). 23.3% of the resistant group had previously received antituberculosis drugs as against 15.4% in the sensitive group. There was a significant association between previous therapy and resistance to antituberculosis drugs. Recommendations to reduce the problem of resistance and to improve compliance are discussed.
