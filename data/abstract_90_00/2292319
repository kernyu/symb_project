Irregular and inadequate surveillance of fever cases, misdiagnosis of positive cases and the near nonexistence of an appropriate monitoring mechanism culminated in an outbreak of malaria in a village of Kheda district, Gujarat. Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) resistance to chloroquine must have aided in the increase of Pf cases. DDT still appears to be effective against the vector, A. culicifacies in the area. Amodiaquine was successful in clearing asexual parasites in 83% cases which were resistant to chloroquine. Bioenvironmental control of malaria is suggested in order to delay the development of insecticidal resistance in vector mosquitoes.
