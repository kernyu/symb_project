Two novel plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases (CTX-M-5 and CTX-M-6) produced by Salmonella typhimurium clinical strains were characterized. The enzymes exhibited a pI of 8.4, hydrolyzed oxyimino-beta-lactams and were susceptible to mechanism-based beta-lactamase inhibitors. The respective bla genes were cloned and sequenced. The deduced amino acid sequences showed a high degree of homology with those of the previously described plasmid class A CTX-M-type enzymes and appeared related to the chromosomal beta-lactamases of Klebsiella oxytoca.
