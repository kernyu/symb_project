This paper describes current methods useful to define molecular markers from a collection of Neisseria gonorrhoeae strains. The procedures of auxotyping, serotyping and plasmid profiling led to the obtention of 10 auxotypes, 19 serotypes and five plasmid types (including beta-lactamase plasmids) among 41 gonococci studied. Twelve patterns of antimicrobial resistance were determined as well, through in vitro susceptibility testing by agar dilution. These tools in conjunction, offer the possibility to study gonorrhea in a dynamic fashion from an epidemiologic perspective. Furthermore, they have allowed us to establish a gonococcal reference laboratory in our institution.
