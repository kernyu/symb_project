Transposon Tn7 has been known to carry genes for resistance to trimethoprim and spectinomycin. A poorly expressed streptothricin resistance gene, identical to the sat gene found in transposons Tn1825 and Tn1826, was localized between the two mentioned genes in Tn7. The surroundings of all three resistance genes indicated site-specific insertion of genetic cassettes.
