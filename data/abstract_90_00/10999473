Chiral derivatives of two cyclohexylethyl halopyridyl thiourea compounds (HI-509 and HI-510), two alpha-methyl benzyl halopyridyl compounds (HI-511 and HI-512), and a cyclohexyl ethyl thiazolyl thiourea compound (HI-513) were synthesized as nonnucleoside inhibitors (NNI) of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) reverse transcriptase (RT). The R stereoisomers of all five compounds inhibited the recombinant RT in vitro with 100-fold lower IC50 values. HI-509R, HI-510R, HI-511R, HI-512R and HI-513R were active anti-HIV agents and inhibited HIV-1 replication in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells at nanomolar concentrations, whereas their enantiomers were inactive. Each of these five compounds was also active against NNI-resistant HIV-1 strains, with HI-511R being the most active agent. When tested against the NNI-resistant HIV-1 strain A17 with a Y181C mutation in RT, HI-511R was found to be 10,000-times more active than nevirapine, 5000-times more active than delavirdine, and 50-times more active than trovirdine. HI-511 R inhibited the HIV-strain A17 variant, containing RT mutations Y181C plus K103N, with an IC50 value of 2.7 microM, whereas the IC50 values of nevirapine, delavirdine, and trovirdine against this highly NNI-resistant HIV-1 strain were >100 microM.
