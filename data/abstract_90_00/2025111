The beta-lactamase activity of staphylococci isolated from the nasopharynx and skin of children with destructive affections of the lungs and from blood of patients with cardiovascular diseases subjected to surgical operations was determined with acidometric and microbiological procedures. Interrelation between synthesis of beta-lactamase by the staphylococcal strains and their resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics was demonstrated. No correlation of the antibiotic resistance and the taxonomic position of the staphylococcal strains was observed.
