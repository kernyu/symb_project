Respiratory tract infections (RTIs), the most common indication for outpatient antimicrobial therapy, impose a heavy medical and societal burden and present a difficult therapeutic challenge in the face of increasing pathogen resistance worldwide. Gatifloxacin is a new broad-spectrum fluoroquinolone with excellent activity against prevalent respiratory bacteria, including penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae and atypical pathogens. A multicenter, open-label, noncomparative surveillance study carried out in Mexico evaluated the safety and efficacy of oral gatifloxacin 400 mg once daily in 17,923 adult outpatients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) (n = 3322), acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (AECB) (n = 5885), and acute bacterial sinusitis (n = 8716). Voluntary, unpaid physician participation contributed to an unbiased study design. Physician-assessed global rate of cure or improvement was 96.3%; efficacy was 95.8% in CAP, 96.1% in AECB, and 96.4% in sinusitis. The incidences of relapse (1.5%) and therapeutic failure (0.7%) were low. The most commonly reported adverse events, nausea (2.76%), headache (2.20%), and dizziness (1.33%), were generally mild and self-limited. Oral gatifloxacin 400 mg once daily is effective and safe for patients with CAP, AECB, and acute sinusitis.
