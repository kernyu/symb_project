Isolated from an Escherichia coli strain MEN-1 is a plasmid-mediated beta-lactamase that confers resistance to methoxy imino third-generation cephalosporins. The protein purified to homogeneity was digested by trypsin, chymotrypsin and endoproteinase Asp-N. Amino acid sequence determinations of the resulting peptides gave rise to the alignment of the 263 residues of the beta-lactamase. From amino acid sequence comparison MEN-1 was found to share more than 72% identity with the chromosomally mediated beta-lactamases of Klebsiella oxytoca. Therefore, MEN-1 is the first transferable extended-spectrum beta-lactamase which is not directly derived from the widespread TEMs or SHV-1 penicillinases with which it presents less than 39% identity.
