BACKGROUND: To reinforce the staple line of the emphysematous lung and thereby prevent air leakage during thoracoscopic operations, we have developed a procedure of lung excision that uses a gelatin-resorcinol-formaldehyde-glutaraldehyde (GRFG) glue-spread stapler. METHODS: Formaldehyde-glutaraldehyde (FG) jelly is prepared by mixing FG fluid with 2.5% sodium carboxymethyl cellulose. The FG jelly is placed in the stapler groove and staple holes, and a gelatin-resorcinol (GR) mixture is applied. The GRFG glue-spread stapler was applied to emphysematous lung cutting during thoracoscopic operations in 10 cases. RESULTS: An adhesion-strength test showed no difference in glue adhesion between FG fluid and FG jelly. An experiment using swine lung showed that with this newly developed stapler, no resistance in firing occurred, and GRFG glue covered every staple hole. Clinical application in 10 cases with emphysematous lung demonstrated no air leakage from the staple line, even long after the operation. CONCLUSIONS: Emphysematous lung excision using the GRFG glue-spread stapler during thoracoscopic operations is useful in preventing air leakage from the staple line and is a simple, safe, and low-cost procedure.
