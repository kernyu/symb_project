In the 85 renal units of Greece, enterococci were recovered from 10 samples of tap water, 6 of treated hemodialysis water, and 21 of dialysate. Eleven isolates were Enterococcus faecium, and 8 were Enterococcus raffinosus; 6 other additional enterococcal species were found. Twenty-two strains exhibited high-level resistance to streptomycin, 16 were resistant to rifampicin, and one to erythromycin. In our hemodialysis units, treated water and dialysate raise concern regarding transfer to patients of uncommon enterococcal species exhibiting high-level streptomycin resistance.
