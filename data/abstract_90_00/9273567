Quinine was the first antimalarial drug to be employed and also the first resistance was noticed to. After 1960 quinine urged to be reintroduced in routine therapy alone or in combination. Aiming at evaluating the effectiveness of different schedules we studied 484 patients seen at the Malaria Laboratory. We used quinine alone in 126 patients, quinine plus sulfadoxine and pyrimethamine in 119 patients and quinine plus tetracycline in 239 patients. The results shown that 81% of all patients were treated with success and only 0.6% were R2. and there is no R3. We emphasize a high resistance rate to quinine either alone (23.1%) or associated to sulfadoxine and pyrimethamine (37.8%). A higher resistance rate seen with the combination might be linked to the smaller dose of quinine used in that instance. It is worth noting the high cure rate with the quinine-tetracycline association.
