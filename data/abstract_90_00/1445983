Non-anthracis Bacillus species are ubiquitous gram-positive spore-forming organisms that were once believed to be nonpathogenic but are now recognized as causing a variety of infections. We report a new aspect of trauma associated with bacillus infection: clinically significant infection by Bacillus species in patients who are involved in motor vehicle accidents and sustain injury related to road contact. Cases were evaluated retrospectively from May 1990 through December 1991. Four patients who had documented infections with Bacillus species and who were involved in motor vehicle accidents associated with road trauma were identified during this period. The antibiotic susceptibility profile of the Bacillus species consistently demonstrated resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics. This series of cases illustrates an additional aspect of disease associated with bacteria of the Bacillus species that should be considered for patients who have sustained injuries from motor vehicle accidents associated with road trauma.
