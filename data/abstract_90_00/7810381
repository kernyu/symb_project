Extensive research on the epidemiology, pathophysiology, and control of malaria during pregnancy has led to new developments and some controversies. Meanwhile, malaria remains a major environmental factor causing serious pregnancy complications, whose incidence and severity depend on gestational age, parity, and the level of malaria endemicity. There is no cohesive explanation for pregnancy-related immunosuppression, though several pathophysiological hypotheses have been proposed. Furthermore, the emergence and rapid spread of chloroquine resistance has complicated the epidemiology, and the policy on alternative chemoprophylaxis. Chemoprophylaxis is probably the only available option for the control of malaria during pregnancy in Africa. However, the best delivery strategy still has to be established. Daily proguanil is the best chemoprophylactic drug at hand. Its deployment should include constant monitoring for the emergence of proguanil resistance, as well as controlled supervision of the distribution of the drug. New control options, such as the use of insecticide-impregnated bed nets, and intermittent targeted mass chemotherapy, require more operational research before they can be broadly recommended.
