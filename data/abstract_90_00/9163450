Nineteen multidrug-resistant (MDR) Mycobacterium complex strains isolated in a nosocomial outbreak were characterized at the molecular level. The strains were microbiologically characterized as Mycobacterium bovis. The mpt40 sequence was not present in chromosomal DNA from these strains, supporting the fact that they were M. bovis. All of the isolates were resistant to isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, ethambutol, streptomycin, para-aminosalicylic acid, clarithromycin, cycloserine, ethionamide, ofloxacin, capreomycin, and amikacin. By performing the standardized IS6110 fingerprinting by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis, we were able to differentiate two groups (groups A and B) containing two (16 isolates) and three (3 isolates) IS6110 copies, respectively. These strains were typed by spoligotyping, developed to distinguish M. bovis strains and also to distinguish them from M. tuberculosis strains (J. Kamerbeek et al., J. Clin. Microbiol. 35:907-914, 1997). All the strains were confirmed to be M. bovis. In addition, spoligotyping showed a difference in only 1 of 43 spacers between RFLP groups A and B. The rpo beta region of several strains representative of each identified group was cloned and sequenced, and identical mutations (Ser-531 to Leu) responsible for the rifampin resistance phenotype were found. To our knowledge, this is the first characterization at the molecular level of an MDR M. bovis strain responsible for a nosocomial outbreak.
