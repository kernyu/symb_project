Numerous studies have detected frequent losses of heterozygosity at polymorphic loci on chromosomal arms 10p and 10q in human prostate cancers. To confirm the presence of tumor suppressor genes in these chromosomal regions, fragments of normal human chromosome 10 tagged with a neomycin resistance gene were transferred into cells from a human prostate cancer cell line. PPC-1, by microcell-mediated chromosome transfer. Two of the six hybrid clones obtained showed decreased tumorigenicity in athymic nude mice and decreased efficiency of colony formation in soft agar compared with PPC-1; the other four retained fully malignant phenotypes. Analysis of polymorphic loci on chromosome 10 in these hybrid clones suggested that a tumor suppressor gene associated with prostate cancer is located within a 17-cM region at distal 10p.
