gyrA mutations in quinolone-resistant pathogenic isolates of Staphylococcus spp. have been detected by the direct HinfI digestion of polymerase chain reaction products. Homology among gyrA genes allowed rapid examination of both coagulase-positive and -negative isolates. DNA sequence analysis revealed that ciprofloxacin resistance in Staphylococcus epidermidis is associated with a novel Ser-84----Phe mutation in the DNA gyrase A protein, analogous to Ser-84----Leu changes observed in Staphylococcus aureus.
