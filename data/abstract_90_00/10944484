In mice, individual dietary omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids n-3 (PUFA) were found to be sufficient to effect the changes in circulating interleukin (IL)-12 and interferon (IFN)-gamma levels that were previously seen in fish oil-fed mice. Weanling female C3H mice were fed one of five experimental diets. All five diets met all known nutritional requirements for mice and differed only in the fat source. After 4 weeks, mice were challenged with live Listeria monocytogenes or sterile PBS. Twenty-four hours after infection, n-3 PUFA-fed mice had significantly lower circulating IL-12 p70 and IFN-gamma than mice fed the control diet (P<.01). In addition, splenic cytokine mRNA for IL-12 p40, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and IL-1beta were lower in infected mice fed n-3 PUFA-containing diets than in mice fed the olive oil ethyl esters control diet. The reduction of IL-12 and IFN-gamma production by n-3 PUFA may have important implications for host infectious disease resistance.
