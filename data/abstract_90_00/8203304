It is usual for people to be infected for some period in life with parasitic worms, which may cause morbidity or even kill. Anthelmintics are used for the treatment and control of the human helminthiases, since no vaccines are yet available. Despite the widespread use of these compounds, drug resistance has become apparent only with antischistosomal chemotherapy, in contrast to the situation with other anti-infective agents in human medicine and with veterinary anthelmintics, where resistance is widespread. This paper reviews research on drug resistance in human helminthiasis with emphasis on schistosomicidal drugs.
