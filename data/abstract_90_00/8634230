An open clinical study to assess the efficacy and tolerance of Roxithromycin 150 mg twice daily was carried out amongst Nigerian patients with upper and lower respiratory tract infections at Plateau Hospital Jos. Twenty-two patients aged between 13 and 86 years comprising of twelve women, seven men and three children completed the study. 18 (81.8%) had bronchopulmonary infections, 3 (13.6%) had tonsillitis and 1 (4.6%) had otitis media. Pathogens isolated included streptococcus Pneumonia (22.7%), Streptococcus pyogenes (13.6%), Bramhella Catarrhalis (9.1%), Haemophilus influenzae (9.1%), Staphylococcus Aureus (4.6%), Klebsiella species (4.6%), Pseudomonas Aeruginosa (4.6%). There was 88.2% bacteriological cure and patients responded fast, with no major adverse reactions. Roxithromycin is therefore concluded to be an effective well tolerated drug for treatment of respiratory tract infections in Nigerians.
