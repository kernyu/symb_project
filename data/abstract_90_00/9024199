Neospora caninum is a coccidial protozoan parasite that infects a large range of mammals including dogs, cats, mice, and cattle. Morphologically, N. caninum appears indistinguishable from Toxoplasma gondii, although they are genetically distinct. To date there have been no reported cases of this infection in humans, although nonhuman primates may be susceptible to infection. Inbred A/J mice develop no clinical and little histologic evidence of infection in spite of a high-dose inoculum of N. caninum. Splenocytes obtained from infected mice proliferate in vitro in response to both N. caninum and T. gondii-soluble antigen. A transient state of T cell hyporesponsiveness to parasite antigen and mitogen was observed at Day 7 p.i. This downregulatory response could be partially reversed by the addition of the nitric oxide antagonist LNMMA, but not antibody to IL-10. Mice infected with N. caninum produce significant quantities of IL-12 and IFN gamma, most evident shortly after infection. In vivo, antibody to IL-12 is able to neutralize immune resistance to the parasite. Moreover, in vivo depletion of IFN gamma with antibody renders the mice susceptible to infection. These observations suggest that N. caninum induces a T cell immune response in the infected host that is at least partially mediated by IL-12 and IFN gamma.
