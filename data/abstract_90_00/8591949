In a randomized trial, a high dosage chloroquine monotherapy (45 mg/kg over 3 days) was compared with combination regimens of sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine and chloroquine/clindamycin for treating Gabonese school children with Plasmodium falciparum malaria. In chloroquine treated patients only 32% were ultimately cured. In contrast, more than 90% of patients were cured after treatment with either combination regimen.
