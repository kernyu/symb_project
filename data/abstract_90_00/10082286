Although clinical observations suggest that males are more susceptible than females to ototoxic drugs, controlled experimental studies investigating gender susceptibility have not been performed. Aminoglycosides initially attack the cochlea's outer hair cells (OHCs). We investigated the effects of the aminoglycoside, kanamycin, on electrophysiological function of OHCs in male and female rats. Animals were grouped by gender and treated with kanamycin (400 mg/kg/day kanamycin base, intramuscular injection) or equivolume normal saline. Administration was continued until distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) suggested a loss in OHC function in kanamycin-treated rats. Males treated with kanamycin showed changes in DPOAE thresholds and amplitudes as early as treatment day 10 which spread to all test frequencies by treatment day 13. In contrast, females treated with kanamycin did not show significant changes in thresholds or amplitudes until treatment day 22. The mechanism of increased male susceptibility to kanamycin cochleotoxicity has not been determined.
