This CPC concerns a 47-year-old male patient with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). The patient became symptomatic when he developed Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, but recovered sufficiently to be treated as an outpatient. Two years after falling ill, he developed septic shock and died within a short time. During this period, he failed to respond to HIV drugs, and there was no improvement in his immunodeficient status. The HIV retrieved from the patient's organs at autopsy was found to be type E and to have acquired resistance to Zidovudine. It was also possible to determine the route of infection. HIV treatment guidelines are continuously being revised on the basis of HIV research and the development of new treatment plans, and at the present time, when no definitive method of treatment has yet been established, it is essential for the clinician to keep abreast of the latest information. Since HIV patients are compromised hosts, it is important to diagnose and treat other infectious complications, not only complications unique to AIDS, and we have briefly described the latest HIV therapy.
