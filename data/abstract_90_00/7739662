A male infant with obstructive uropathy developed yeast cell agglomerations which were detectable macroscopically and by image-generating techniques within both renal pelvises after Candida albicans infection of the urinary tract. Therapy with flucytosine induced excretion of 'fungal balls' via the urethra. Continuation of therapy with liposomal amphotericin B (AmBisome) prevented a relapse after development of fungal resistance against flucytosine. Sonographically or radiographically detectable formation of 'concrements' within the urinary tract of patients with an immature or compromised immune system and additional features such as obstructive urinary tract should suggest a localized or systemic mycosis, particularly in the context of long-term antibiotic treatment.
