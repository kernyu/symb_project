OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the occurrence of intestinal colonization in newborns by multidrug-resistant enterobacteria strains (MDRES) during hospital stay after birth. We used selective media in an attempt to determine the relationship between isolation of these strains and some of the presumed colonization risk factors. METHOD: A sequencial inclusion study of 30 newborns was carried out in the neonatal unit of the HUPE, State University Hospital, a general 600-bed tertiary care hospital. We obtained clinical and epidemiological information from medical records and collected a fecal sample from each newborn, which was plated in gentamicin (8mg/ml) medium and potassium tellurite (25mg/ml) medium. The isolated strains were biochemically identified and also submitted to tests of antimicrobial susceptibility. Nine MDRES were submitted to an assay for plasmid conjugational transfer. RESULTS: We isolated 56 distinct MDRES from 14 among 30 newborns (46.7%). Klebsiella pneumoniae was the most common bacterial species (38/56 (68%). We found statistical association between individual MDRES isolation and presence of 3 or 4 of the following colonization risk factors considered: antimicrobial use, low weight (<2.500g), more than 6 days of hospitalization and artificial milk feeding (p< 0.02). We could detect plasmid resistance transfer by bacterial conjugation for 8 among 9 MDRES. CONCLUSION: The seletive cultura media were useful to detect the high frequence of newborns colonized by MDRES in association with well established infection risk factors. We emphasize the importance of reinforcing control rules aiming at preventing intestinal colonization viewed as a risk of nosocomial infection.
