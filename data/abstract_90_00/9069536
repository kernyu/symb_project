The MICs of amphotericin B, miconazole, ketoconazole, flucytosine, itraconazole and fluconazole for 19 isolates of Fusarium oxysporum, 16 Fusarium solani, seven Fusarium verticilliodes, four Fusarium proliferatum, four Fusarium dimerum, three Fusarium equiseti, and one each of the following species: Fusarium graminearum, Fusarium chlamydosporum, Fusarium semitectum, Fusarium avenaceum and Fusarium subglutinans were determined by a broth microdilution method. Thirty-eight of these isolates were of clinical origin and 20 from environmental sources. In general, Fusarium spp. strains showed resistance to all the antifungals tested. However, the most active agent was amphotericin B. Fluconazole and flucytosine were not active against any of the isolates tested. A correlation study of in-vitro testing with in-vivo outcome of amphotericin B of the cases of disseminated fusarium infections published is reported.
