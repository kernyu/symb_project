The workshop agenda consisted of three major components: (1) resistance as a phenomenon and the major factors contributing to its increasing prevalence; (2) surveillance activities and needs; and (3) options for response. Its primary objectives were to extract those aspects of resistance that seemed most pressing, to inspect the potential of new scientific advances to spur needed diagnostic and therapeutic advances, and to examine areas of intervention most likely to return the biggest payback to investments of funding, research, advocacy, and education.
