We report the isolation of three strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae sensu lato, brought into the United Kingdom by patients from Greece and Egypt, that showed plasmid-determined resistance to ceftazidime. All three produced beta-lactamases shown by DNA hybridisation studies to belong to the SHV group. One produced an enzyme that appeared to be related to, but distinguishable from, SHV-1; another SHV-2 and the third SHV-5.
