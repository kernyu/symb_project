BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy of ProME(Epidoxorubicin)CE-CytaBOM (PE-C) and ProMI(Idarubicin)CE-CytaBOM (PI-C) in the treatment of adult patients with aggressive non Hodgkin's lymphoma in a multicenter randomized controlled trial performed by 18 centers of the Italian Lymphoma Study Group (GISL). DESIGN AND METHODS: One hundred and twenty-eight and 122 patients were randomly assigned to receive either 6 courses of PE-C or PI-C, respectively. Some patients achieving complete remission with induction therapy participated in another randomized study comparing no further therapy versus maintenance therapy consisting of four blocks of two drugs. RESULTS: The rate of CRs was 62% and 64% for patients treated with PE-C and PI-C, respectively (p = 0.51). The 5-year relapse-free survival was 60% for PE-C and 53% for PI-C (p = 0.29). The estimated relapse-free disease survival rates at 4 years were 75% for patients in the consolidation group and 57% for those in the observation group (p = 0.11). Patients alive in first complete remission 4 years after study entry were estimated to be 39% in the PE-C arm and 38% in the PI-C arm (p = 0.90). The 3-year and 5-year estimated survival rates were 61% and 55% for the PE-C group and 56% and 47% for the PI-C group (p = 0.26). Fatal toxicities occurred in 7 patients (2.9%) with active disease and in 4 patients (1.7%) in complete remission. Stage (p = 0.04), bulky disease (p = 0.02), serum LDH (p = 0.0006), serum albumin (p = 0.0051), hemoglobin (p = 0.0011), performance status (p = 0.0001), International prognostic index (p < 0.0001) and the index proposed by the French group G.E.L.A. (p < 0.0001) were of prognostic value. In a multivariate analysis (Cox regression model) alternatively IPI alone or G.E.L.A. index plus performance status emerged as independent prognostic factors. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: The present study indicates that epirubicin and idarubicin in a combined chemotherapy regimen, have similar activities. The toxic profile also indicates the safety of both anthracyclines at the dosages employed, suggesting their possible dose escalation in a combined chemotherapy setting. PE-C and PI-C were both effective and feasible regimens in an outpatient setting, with acceptable cardiovascular toxicity. The trend toward a better outcome in patients undergoing consolidation therapy after the achievement of a complete remission, warrants further investigation.
