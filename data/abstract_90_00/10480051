Drug sensitivity of clinically isolated bacteria to cefozopran (CZOP), which is a new cephem antibiotic, was investigated, and the usefulness of the drug was evaluated from the viewpoint of bacteriological and clinical (pneumonia) break points. The following results were obtained. 1. According to bacteriological break points, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Enterococcus spp. showed low sensitivity to cefozopran (CZOP). However, the sensitivity of methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), E. coli, and Klebsiella spp., which are often isolated as pathogens of common infections, was 100%, that of Enterobacter spp., Serratia sp., and Citrobacter sp. was 90% or higher, and that of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was 80% or higher; the values were comparable to or better than those for ceftazidime (CAZ). These results suggest a expanded antibacterial spectrum and enhanced antibacterial potency of CZOP. 2. The estimated response rate of pneumonia to CZOP was 87.5% in outpatients and 51.9% in inpatients. Therefore, CZOP is considered to be one of the first choices especially in outpatient empiric therapy.
