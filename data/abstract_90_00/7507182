We have selected and plaque purified zidovudine (3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine [AZT])-resistant mutants from an infectious molecular clone of feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV). The patterns of cross-resistance and drug susceptibilities of these mutants were similar to those of the AZT-resistant FIV that we previously selected in vitro from a wild-type FIV population and to those of the most common AZT-resistant clinical isolates of human immunodeficiency virus type 1. Two AZT-resistant mutants of FIV, one selected from a normal population and one selected from the molecular clone, each reverted rapidly to an AZT-sensitive phenotype when passaged in the absence of drug. Sequence analysis of the reverse transcriptase (RT)-encoding region from the plaque-purified AZT-resistant FIV revealed a single base change at position 2939, resulting in a Glu-to-Lys substitution at amino acid 202 of the RT. Similar analyses of plaque-purified revertants showed that the phenotypic reversion was not the result of a genotypic reversion at this position and that no additional mutations existed within the RT-encoding region of the revertants. Moreover, RTs purified from the mutant and revertant were both resistant to the 5'-triphosphate of AZT. These results indicate the complexity of AZT resistance and suggest the presence of additional factors, outside the RT-encoding region, which may contribute to AZT resistance.
