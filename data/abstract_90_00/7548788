During the past few years it has become apparent that simultaneous resistance of tumour cells to a number of heterocyclic drugs (multidrug resistance) is often correlated with overexpression of a P-glycoprotein (P-gp or P-170). P-gp expression can be studied by molecular biology and immunohistochemical techniques. The latter provide a rapid, sensitive and specific screening method suitable for testing even a relatively small number of tumour cells like those obtained at biopsy. The aim of this study was to detect and localize the immunohistochemical expression of P-gp in normal and neoplastic gastrointestinal tissue using the Mab JSB-1 in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded specimens. A particularly striking finding of our study was the consistent, prevalent higher expression of P-gp in the stomach than in the colon, with a higher percentage of immunostaining in normal than in neoplastic tissue. This is in agreement with the fact that not only is the prognosis known to be worse for stomach cancer, but also the response to treatment is lower. Further studies should be carried out to verify the possibility of making routine tests of this kind for the evaluation of multidrug resistance, to guide the selection of patients for treatment of cancer with chemotherapeutic drugs.
