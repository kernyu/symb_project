We present a new marker that confers both resistance to pyrimethamine and green fluorescent protein-based fluorescence on the malarial parasite Plasmodium berghei. A single copy of the cassette integrated into the genome is sufficient to direct fluorescence in parasites throughout the life cycle, in both its mosquito and vertebrate hosts. Erythrocyte stages of the parasite that express the marker can be sorted from control parasites by flow cytometry. Pyrimethamine pressure is not necessary for maintaining the cassette in transformed parasites during their sporogonic cycle in mosquitoes, including when it is borne by a plasmid. This tool should thus prove useful in molecular studies of P. berghei, both for generating parasite variants and monitoring their behavior.
