The in vivo synergistic effect of cefodizime (CDZM) in combination with minocycline (MINO) against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was investigated. A study of fractional effective dose (FED) index showed that either synergistic or additive effect was observed between CDZM and MINO. The postantibiotic effect (PAE) of MINO was not altered by the addition of CDZM. However, a strong synergistic bactericidal effect of CDZM and MINO against MRSA CT-18 was observed for more than 14 hours in the presence of immunocompromised tumour bearing murine polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN). These results suggest that the strong therapeutic efficacy of CDZM in combination with MINO was caused by synergistic bactericidal effect of the 2 drugs in the presence of PMN.
