In a randomized double-blind study, nine mycobacteremic patients with AIDS-related disseminated Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) infection received clarithromycin or placebo in addition to a basic regimen that included isoniazid, ethambutol and clofazimine. All four patients receiving clarithromycin showed blood culture conversion and clinical response. Of the five patients treated without clarithromycin, two showed resolution of mycobacteremia and clinical response, while another two died without having shown response. The remaining patient deteriorated until a switch from placebo to clarithromycin led to blood culture conversion and rapid clinical improvement. After finishing six weeks of intensive treatment, clarithromycin was given in an open maintenance phase to all patients, initially in combination with rifabutin for 24 weeks and then alone. One patient had a relapse of MAC infection while receiving clarithromycin alone. The relapse was associated with acquired resistance to the drug. Clarithromycin appears to be a promising component of multi-drug therapy for patients with MAC infection. Monotherapy can lead to drug resistance.
