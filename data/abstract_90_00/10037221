The production and roles of endogenous tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) in the infection of Corynebacterium (C.) pseudotuberculosis were investigated in mice. The maximum levels of TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma were detected on day 4 after infection. The administration of anti-TNF-alpha monoclonal antibody (mAb) as well as anti-IFN-gamma mAb increased bacterial proliferation in the organs, leading to the death of infected mice, but anti-IFN-gamma mAb showed a less marked effect than anti-TNF-alpha mAb. The suppressive effect of anti-TNF-alpha and anti-IFN-gamma mAbs on anticorynebacterial resistance was augmented by the simultaneous administration of these antibodies. Anti-TNF-alpha mAb was found to be highly effective when administered on day 0 and day 4, suggesting that TNF-alpha produced during the early stage of infection is critical for the generation of resistance. Histologically, many microabscesses, severe follicular swelling and lymphocyte destruction were observed in mice treated with anti-TNF-alpha or anti-IFN-gamma mAb. Injection of anti-CD4 or anti-CD8 mAb also resulted in significantly increased mortality and a marked suppression of IFN-gamma production, but had no effect on TNF-alpha production. Carrageenan also showed a marked effect on the exacerbation of infection. Taken together, these results suggest that endogenously produced TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma are both essential to the host defense against C. pseudotuberculosis infection and that these cytokines may have an additive effect.
