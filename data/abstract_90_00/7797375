Within 12 h of reducing the daily intake of a 50:50 lucerne and wheaten hay ration from 800 to 400 g, there was an increase in digesta marker concentration indicating a reduction in the flow rate of digesta fluid and particulates through the abomasum of sheep. The efficacy of the recommended dose of oxfendazole (OFZ) was then tested against benzimidazole resistant Trichostrongylus colubriformis and Haemonchus contortus in sheep whose feed intake was halved 36 h before and after drug treatment. In animals fed the reduced ration there was a 60% reduction of T. colubriformis and 94% reduction of H. contortus compared with a 19% and 60% reduction respectively on the higher feed intake. It is therefore suggested that greater anthelmintic efficacy can be achieved in sheep by temporary feed reduction.
