Mutations in the parC gene, which encodes a subunit of topoisomerase IV, were determined in 21 epidemiologically unrelated clinical isolates of Acinetobacter baumannii. Our studies highlight the conserved sequences in the quinolone-resistance-determining region of the parC gene from A. baumannii and other bacteria. Nine of ten isolates with MICs of ciprofloxacin of > or = 32 mg/L showed a change of Ser80 to Leu and one showed a change of Glu84 to Lys. These results suggest that ParC from A. baumannii is a secondary target for quinolones and that mutations at residues Ser80 and Glu84, when combined with mutations at Ser83 of GyrA, may render A. baumannii highly resistant to quinolones.
