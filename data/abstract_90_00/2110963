Three-hundred and eighty-five strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were isolated from Gunma University Hospital from 1984 to 1987. Out of these strains, thirty strains (7.8%) were resistant to GM. We investigated antibiograms, serotyping, phage typing, and plasmid profiles of these strains. The following results were obtained. 1) Only one kind of GM-resistant (GMr) plasmid was obtained in 1984. Two kinds of GMr plasmids were found in 1985, and three kinds of GMr plasmids in 1987, respectively. 2) A strain of I-serotype and Hh8-phage type containing the plasmid I (GM-SM-SA-PIPC, Tra-, 22.6Kb or 22.5 Kb) was suspected to cause the nosocomial infection mainly in Departments of Internal Medicine, and a strain of non-serotypable and Hh8-phage type containing the plasmid IV (GM-SM-SA-CP-Hg, Tra+, IncP-2) was suspected to cause the nosocomial infection mainly in Surgical Departments. 3) Plasmid profiles adding to serotyping and phagetyping contribute to the epidemiological analysis of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection.
