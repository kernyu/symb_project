An interactive teleconference on HIV-associated lipodystrophies and altered body habitus was held on January 20, 1999, part of a series known as HIV Treatment LIVE!. It was moderated by Ronald Baker, Ph.D., and sponsored by the AIDS Wasting Foundation (AWF). AWF, located at 15 East 26th Street, New York, NY 10010, was founded in 1997 as an education and advocacy organization, under the direction of Carola Burroughs, Executive Director. This tele-conference brought together three AIDS experts to address important issues concerning the etiology, diagnosis, and treatment of this novel and enigmatic syndrome. The resulting report is an edited, selected transcript of that discussion.
