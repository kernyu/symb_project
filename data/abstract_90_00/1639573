Efficacy of ivermectin on susceptible or resistant populations of the parasitic nematode Haemonchus contortus was determined in cattle and goats held in a barn. Goats were each infected with 3000 infective, ivermectin-susceptible or -resistant H. contortus larvae on day 0 and reinfected with 2000 infective larvae on day 24. Goats were treated orally with 600 micrograms kg-1 ivermectin on day 31. No significant differences were detected in blood packed cell volume (PCV) or total protein (TP), prepatent period, or epg among the four groups of goats that were each infected with one of four parasite strains (one susceptible, three resistant). There were no differences among the four parasite strains in the numbers of infective larvae that developed to the third larval stage from fecal cultures or in the viability of cultured infective larvae when held in the laboratory at 27 +/- 1 degrees C for 14 weeks. After treatment with ivermectin, there were significant differences among the parasite strains in PCV, TP, and epg. Total worm counts were reduced by 94 to 97% with three times the recommended dose. Immature and adult Skrjabinema ovis were also present in two treated goats. In a second test, one goat infected once with 10,000 infective larvae of a resistant strain of H. contortus and then treated with nine doses of ivermectin, increasing from 500 to 2000 micrograms kg-1 over a period of 133 days, had 35 adult worms at necropsy. In a third test, three calves were readily infected with an ivermectin-resistant strain of H. contortus from goats.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
