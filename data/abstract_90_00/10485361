Cyathostomes are common nematode parasites of horses, donkeys and mules in developing countries. These equids usually work on a daily basis and this includes transportation of goods, crops and people. Stress, associated with work, and limited nutrition often result in a loss of condition, and cyathostomid nematodes may, then, cause clinical disease. Because anthelmintics are not always accessible or affordable in many parts of Africa, or there may be anthelmintic resistance to current remedies, management practices are often used as an adjunct to chemotherapy. This paper discusses some current approaches to the control of cyathostomes in developing countries in Africa, as well as proposed areas of research which are practical and appropriate to this problem.
