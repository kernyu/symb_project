Vancomycin-resistant enterococci have been isolated with increasing frequency since 1988. Thus far, most of these resistant enterococci have belonged to the Enterococcus faecium species, and epidemiological studies have shown a wide diversity among interhospital and intrahospital isolates. This report presents an epidemiologic investigation of 25 vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus strains--24 Enterococcus faecium and one Enterococcus gallinarum--isolated from the stools or blood of adult patients receiving intravenous vancomycin prophylaxis during neutropenia and hospitalized in a single hematologic unit. Macrorestriction patterns of total DNA and of ribosomal DNA regions were used to analyze the strains. Strains produced different total DNA restriction fragment length polymorphism patterns after SmaI digestion. Ribotyping was less discriminative than pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. The results confirmed the genetic unrelatedness of the strains. Prolonged vancomycin administration, commonly used in hematologic units, could be involved in the selection of endogenous resistant enterococcal strains.
