Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium bovis are facultative intracellular pathogens which preferentially utilize the macrophage as their host cell. Acquired resistance against mycobacteria depends on T cells which activate antimicrobial macrophage functions via the release of cytokines. The data summarized below suggest an important role for interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) as well as the B cell-stimulatory factors interleukin-4 (IL-4) and IL-6 in the induction of tuberculostatic macrophage functions. Growth inhibition of mycobacteria by cytokine-stimulated macrophages is mediated by reactive nitrogen intermediates (RNI) derived from L-arginine. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and IL-10 act as autocrine regulators in the induction of the enzyme NO-synthase. Both cytokines are produced by macrophages stimulated with IFN-gamma and infected with M. bovis. While TNF-alpha mediates activation of the NO-synthase and production of RNI, IL-10 suppresses this enzyme activity. The outcome of mycobacterial infection is probably regulated by a complex network between stimulatory and inhibitory cytokines.
