The clinical results of this study indicate that a half-dose regimen of artesunate followed by mefloquine produces an acceptable cure rate when compared to other commonly available drugs for treating acute uncomplicated falciparum malaria in Thailand. The 90% cure rate was comparable to the results with either a full dose of artesunate (600 mg over 5 days) or mefloquine (25 mg/kg in divided doses six hours apart) as well as the combination of quinine-tetracycline administered for seven days. This abbreviated regimen, however was less effective than the full dose regimen of both drugs previously reported.
