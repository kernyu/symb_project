Listeria monocytogenes is an intracellular bacterium which causes an acute infectious disease in mice. Initial host resistance depends on innate immunity mediated primarily by natural killer (NK) cells followed by specific alpha/beta T cells, which are central to acquired specific immunity. Gamma/delta T lymphocytes seem to provide a link between the innate and the specific immune response. All these lymphocyte populations produce gamma interferon (IFN-gamma), which, because of its macrophage-activating potential, is central to antibacterial protection. IFN-gamma from NK cells not only contributes to early host resistance but also promotes development of protective T-cell responses of helper T type 1 (Th1) type. Here, we show that innate resistance and early IFN-gamma production in listeriosis are markedly impaired in T-cell receptor (TCR)-delta-/- but not TCR-beta-/- gene disruption mutant mice. By two-color cytofluorimetry, we demonstrate that NK cells rather than gamma/delta T lymphocytes are the major cellular source of IFN-gamma in immunocompetent mice and that IFN-gamma production by NK cells is impaired in the TCR-delta-/- mutants. Probably, reduced tumor necrosis factor production in listeria-infected TCR-delta-/- mutants contributed to impaired NK cell activation. Our data reveal a novel function of gamma/delta T cells as regulators of innate resistance against sublethal infection with an intracellular pathogen.
