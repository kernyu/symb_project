Previously reported mutations involved in optochin resistance of Streptococcus pneumoniae clinical isolates changed residues 48, 49 or 50, in the transmembrane alpha-helix 2 of the F(1)/F(0) ATPase subunit. We report here an unusual mutation which changes the sequence of the transmembrane alpha-helix 1 of the AtpC subunit. This mutation involves a Gly to Ser substitution resulting from a G to A transition at codon 14 of the atpC gene.
