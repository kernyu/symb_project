A genotypic analysis of the HIV-1 proteinase was performed on clinical specimen obtained from patients after different periods of Saquinavir (SQV) treatment. Proteinase genes of integrated proviral DNA from PBMC were isolated by PCR, cloned and individual sequences were obtained. Genotypic resistance was defined by the Gly48-->Val and Leu90-->Met exchanges. Frequencies and kinetics of resistance development will be reported for phase I/II trials V13330. V13329, O13328 and ACTG229 in patients on monotherapy or combination therapy with RT inhibitors. Data from V13330 have been analysed in more detail for correspondence of genotypic and phenotypic resistance and any correlation between resistance and changes in plasma viral RNA load. Furthermore, we will discuss the data from our extensive proteinase gene sequence collection with respect to mutational changes which would be indicative of resistance to other inhibitors of HIV-1 proteinase.
