Intestinal colonization by Klebsiella, Enterobacter, and Serratia (KES) strains is a crucial step in the development of nosocomial infections. We studied the adhesive properties, antibiotic resistance, and involvement in colonization or infection of 103 KES clinical isolates: 30 Klebsiella pneumoniae (29%), 16 Klebsiella oxytoca (15%), 30 Enterobacter aerogenes (29%), 14 Enterobacter cloacae (14%), and 13 Serratia sp. (13%) isolates. Half of them were resistant to several antimicrobial agents, including aminoglycosides and beta-lactam antibiotics. A total of 27 of 30 K. pneumoniae isolates (90%) adhered to the human cell line Intestine-407 (Int-407), while none of the K. oxytoca or E. aerogenes isolates and only 2 of the E. cloacae isolates adhered. Three adhesive patterns were observed for K. pneumoniae: an aggregative adhesion in 57% of the isolates, a diffuse adhesion in only one isolate, and a new pattern, localized adhesion, in 30% of the isolates. While most of the sensitive strains adhered with the aggregative phenotype, the localized pattern was associated with resistant K. pneumoniae isolates producing the CAZ-5 beta-lactamase. Furthermore, 45% of such localized-adhesion isolates were involved in severe infections. The distributions of type 1 and type 3 fimbriae, enteroaggregative E. coli, and cf29, pap, and afa/Dr adhesin-encoding genes were determined by using specific DNA probes. No relationship was found between the adhesive pattern and the production of specific fimbriae, suggesting that several unrecognized adhesive factors are involved. Our study indicates that special adhesive properties associated with resistance to antimicrobial agents could account for the pathogenicity of certain nosocomial strains.
