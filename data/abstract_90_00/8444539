BACKGROUND: Mycetoma is a relatively frequent disease in tropical countries. Drugs commonly used need a long period of treatment, and some cases are resistant to these drugs, especially those with bone or visceral involvement. The combination of amoxicillin-clavulanic acid has shown effectiveness against strains of Nocardia brasiliensis in vitro. METHODS: We have used this combination in two cases of mycetoma caused by N. brasiliensis, both with bone involvement and resistance to the drugs usually used. A dose of three tablets a day for 5 to 6 months was given (each tablet contains 500 mg of amoxicillin and 125 mg of clavulanic acid). RESULTS: Clinical and mycologic amelioration was observed in the two cases after completing the treatment. There were no side effects or relapses after 3 to 6 months of follow-up after treatment. CONCLUSIONS: We propose this antibiotic as a new option for the treatment of some special cases of actinomycetoma with bone or visceral involvement or resistance to the drugs commonly used in this disease.
