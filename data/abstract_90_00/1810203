The in vitro activity of cefepime was compared with those of ceftazidime, cefotaxime, and cefpirome against aminoglycoside-resistant gram-negative bacteria. Cefepime was the most active cephalosporin, with a MIC for 90% of strains tested for all non-Pseudomonas aeruginosa species of less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml. No cefepime resistance was encountered among members of the family Enterobacteriaceae. Of the 40 aminoglycoside-resistant P. aeruginosa isolates, 15% were resistant to cefepime, compared with 18% for ceftazidime, 30% for cefpirome, and 35% for cefotaxime. Synergism between cefepime and amikacin was observed and occurred most frequently in P. aeruginosa strains resistant to cefepime but susceptible to amikacin. In no case did cefepime and amikacin exhibit antagonism against P. aeruginosa.
