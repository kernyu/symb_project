This paper reports the results of the conjugating transmission test, the plasmid elimination test and the plasmid analysis of pseudomonas pyocyanea which were separated from the sputum of the patients with infection of respiratory tract. The result of the conjugating test and the plasmid elimination test of P6P8 strains indicated that the partial drug resistances of two strains are mediated by the drug resistant plasmids. The results of the plasmids analysis in 14 strains of pseudomonas pyocyanea showed that this pyocyanic infection was mainly caused by the bacillus pyocyanea carrying 38 x 10(6) dal plasmids. The technique of plasmid analysis is simple and good repetition. The specificity of this method is analogous to phage typing. This method is worth popular in the epidemic investigation of pathogenic bacteria tracing.
