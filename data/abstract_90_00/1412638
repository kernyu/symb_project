4690 children aged 6-15 years in 5 urban and 4 rural communities in 3 ecological zones in Ghana were screened from June 1988 to December 1990 to provide suitable candidates for the World Health Organization standard in vivo test for susceptibility of Plasmodium falciparum to chloroquine. 1880 (40.1%) had parasitaemia, mostly (83.7-98.6%) due to P. falciparum infection. Of the 626 in vivo tests performed, 570 (91.1%) showed sensitivity to chloroquine and 56 (8.9%) responses were classified as resistant to chloroquine at RI (5.1%) and RII (3.8%). The resistance responses were commonest (17.1-22.7%) in the coastal zone, followed by the savanna zone (8.6-10.0%), and lowest in the forest zone (3.1-6.3%). The RII responses occurred mainly in communities in the coastal zone. There was no RIII resistance in any zone. The pattern of RI (early) and RII responses of P. falciparum to chloroquine in this study suggested an increase in sensitivity, or a reduction in resistance, of P. falciparum to chloroquine from the coast to the forest and northern savanna zones, and from the urban to the rural communities in each zone in Ghana.
