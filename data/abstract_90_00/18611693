The World Health Organization has implemented an international program of antibiotic resistance survey, called WHONET, with the participation of 121 laboratories from 41 countries around the world. Argentina joined WHONET program in 1989. Five hospitals from Buenos Aires are taking part, under the coordination of the National Institute of Microbiology 'Dr. C. Malbran'. From the results obtained between 1991 and 1994, the low level of susceptibility to aminopenicillins, cephalosporins and aminoglycosides is remarkable. On the other hand, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus spp. and Staphylococcus spp. have not been detected and imipenem resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter spp. isolates has not overcome 7% and 11%, respectively. Analytical programs utilizing these data aid in the understanding of the epidemiology of antibiotic resistance and in the development of rational antibiotic prescription practices and infection control procedures.
