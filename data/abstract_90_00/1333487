Haemophilus influenzae isolates were uniformly susceptible to enoxacin, ofloxacin, and temafloxacin. Zone diameter and MIC interpretive criteria were proposed to define susceptible populations so that mutants with diminished susceptibility might be detected when and if they appear in clinical specimens. Additional collaborative quality control studies defined MIC and zone size limits for tests with H. influenzae ATCC 49247.
