We identified a DNA polymerase species in Drosophila melanogaster embryos, and purified it. This polymerase shared some common properties with DNA polymerase epsilon from mammals and yeast as follows; it has a preference for poly(dA)/oligo(dT) as a template/primer, it is highly processive in DNA synthesis, it co-fractionates with 3'-5' exonuclease activity, it is sensitive to aphidicolin and is resistance to ddTTP. The polymerase activity was inhibited in the immuno-precipitation assay with anti-pol-epsilon antibodies, which were produced against a polypeptide coded on the cDNA of a putative Drosophila pol-epsilon we isolated previously. Using these antibodies, Western blot analysis revealed that this polymerase is a 250kDa polypeptide, which is the same size as observed in mammals and yeast. These results indicate that Drosophila produces the epsilon-class of DNA polymerase, and like mammals or yeast, possesses the 5 typical classes of DNA polymerases (alpha to epsilon) in its embryos.
