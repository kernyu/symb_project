An in silico scan of the partially completed genome sequence of Bordetella pertussis and analyses of transcriptional fusions generated with a new integrational vector were used to identify new potential virulence genes. The genes encoding a putative siderophore receptor, adhesins, and an autotransporter protein appeared to be regulated in a manner similar to Bordetella virulence genes by the global virulence regulator BvgAS. In contrast, the gene encoding a putative intimin-like protein appeared to be repressed under conditions of virulence.
