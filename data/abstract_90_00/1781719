Resistance of hospital Staphylococci to beta-lactam antibiotics was studied. The strains were isolated in two obstetric hospitals during an outbreak of purulent inflammatory infections in them. A modification of the "clover leaf" procedure providing elucidation of the resistance mechanism was used in the study. Development of the resistance to the beta-lactam antibiotics was shown to be mainly due the activity of beta-lactamases which makes it possible to discuss their role in the mechanism of resistance development.
