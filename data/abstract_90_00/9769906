Microorganisms that are resistant to multiple antimicrobial agents are of great concern to pediatric clinicians. Children infected with antibiotic-resistant bacteria are at risk to not respond to initial therapy. Nosocomial infection of pediatric patients with multidrug-resistant organisms are similar to those found in adults especially for Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, vancomycin resistant Enterococcus and Enterobacteriaceae resistant to third-generation cephalosporin. However on the contrary to adult patients, multidrug-resistant bacteria are found in community infections with penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa in CF patients.
