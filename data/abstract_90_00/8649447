Natural resistance-associated macrophage protein gene 1 (Nramp1) was isolated as a candidate for the mouse gene locus Lsh/Ity/Bcg, which regulates macrophage activation for antimicrobial activity against intracellular pathogens. To investigate the structural and functional organization of the human homologue, NRAMP1, the overlapping genomic clones encompassing NRAMP1 were isolated. These clones spanned approximately 35 kb in size and the nucleotide sequence of 3779 bp of the 5' flanking region has been determined. The transcription start site was mapped by primer extension analysis. A TATA box element and the transcription regulatory elements in the acute phase reaction were found.
