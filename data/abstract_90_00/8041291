A study was undertaken to determine whether the production of penicillin-binding protein-2' (PBP-2') and the production of beta-lactamase were related to the minimum inhibitory concentrations of methicillin (DMPPC) in various strains of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. The amount of PBP-2' produced by the low-level resistant strain L20A was small and the strain became resistant to DMPPC as a result of inactivation of DMPPC by beta-lactamase. The largest amount of PBP-2' produced was in a moderately resistant strain L21A but the MIC was not high since the strain was not capable of producing beta-lactamase and the population of cells was heterogeneous. The amount of PBP-2' produced in the high-level resistant strain L457A was lower than that in strain L21A but the MIC was high as a result of the production of beta-lactamase. Production of PBP-2' was essential for resistance to methicillin but production of beta-lactamase had a major effect on the MIC.
