The cellular fatty acid compositions of 26 strains of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and 17 strains of methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) were analyzed by gas-liquid chromatography. The fatty acid compositions of the two groups were very similar with 16 identified components. The major fatty acids were Ci14 = 0, Ci15 = 0, C18 = 0 and C20 = 0. Among these fatty acids, the percentage of the Ci15 = 0 fatty acid component of MRSA strains (11.4 +/- 3.9%) was statistically higher than that of MSSA strains (6.2 +/- 2.4%) (p < 0.001). On the other hand, the percentage of the C20 = 0 fatty acid components of MRSA strains (20.2 +/- 8.8%) was statistically lower than that of MSSA strains (30.7 +/- 10.4%) (p < 0.001). The production of beta-lactamase and beta-hemolysin in both groups' strain was also unrelated to the relative amounts of the fatty acid components. These results indicated a statistical tendency for the percentage fatty acid compositions of the MRSA strains to be quantitatively different from those of the MSSA for both the Ci15 = 0 and C20 = 0 fatty acid components. Analysis of the fatty acid compositions may have an application in the differentiation of MRSA and MSSA strains.
