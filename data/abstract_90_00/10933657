The activity of 19 antibiotics and four antiseptics and/or disinfectants was studied against 138 non-redundant strains of Aeromonas spp. (104 Aeromonas caviae, 22 Aeromonas sobria and 12 Aeromonas hydrophila) isolated from two European rivers. Antibiotic resistance frequencies were: nalidixic acid, 59%; tetracycline, 14%; fosfomycin, 8%; tobramycin and cotrimoxazole, 7%; cefotaxime, 4%; chloramphenicol, 2%; gentamicin, 1%. Most of the nalidixic acid-resistant strains were susceptible to fluoroquinolones (54-98%). Antibiotic resistance rates varied according to the source of the strains. All Aeromonas spp. strains were killed by 50 ppm of chlorine, cetylpyridinium chloride and peracetic acid, and by 1600 ppm of glutaraldehyde.
