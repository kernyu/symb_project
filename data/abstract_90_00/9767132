Using primers derived from a region of the Candida albicans CDR1 (Candida drug resistance) gene that is conserved in other ABC (ATP-binding cassette) transporters, a DNA fragment from a previously unknown CDR gene was obtained by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). After screening a C. albicans genomic library with this fragment as a probe, the complete CDR4 gene was isolated and sequenced. CDR4 codes for a putative ABC transporter of 1490 amino acids with a high degree of homology to Cdr1p, Cdr2p and Cdr3p from C. albicans (62, 59 and 57% amino acid sequence identity, respectively). Cdr4p has a predicted structure typical for cluster I. 1 of yeast ABC transporters, characterized by two homologous halves, each comprising an N-terminal hydrophilic domain with consensus sequences for ATP binding and a C-terminal hydrophobic domain with six transmembrane helices. In contrast to the CDR1/CDR2 genes, the genetic structure of the CDR4 gene was conserved in 59 C. albicans isolates from six different patients. Northern hybridization analysis showed that the CDR4 gene was expressed in most isolates, but no correlation between CDR4 mRNA levels and the degree of fluconazole resistance of the isolates was found. In addition, a C. albicans mutant in which both copies of the CDR4 gene were disrupted by insertional mutagenesis was not hypersusceptible to fluconazole as compared to the parent strain. Unlike CDR1 and CDR2, CDR4 does not, therefore, seem to be involved in fluconazole resistance in C. albicans.
