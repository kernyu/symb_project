PURPOSE: A gelatin-sealed porous Dacron graft impregnated with rifampin was evaluated in a two-part study of its use in preventing prosthetic infection. METHODS: The graft was impregnated by soaking it for 15 minutes in rifampin (1 mg/ml). In part 1 its antibacterial activity and rifampin retention over time were determined. Infrarenal aortic replacement was performed in pigs, and the rifampin concentration of the graft, serum, and perigraft space was assayed up to 96 hours after surgery. In part 2, infection resistance was tested in pigs in which the retroperitoneum was contaminated with Staphylococcus aureus after graft replacement. The postoperative infection rate was compared in three groups: pigs given gelatin-sealed grafts without rifampin (controls), pigs receiving nonimpregnated grafts and intravenous rifampin (15 mg/kg) for 3 days after surgery, and those given the rifampin grafts. RESULTS: Rifampin was present in the grafts for up to 72 hours after surgery and in the perigraft fluid for 24 hours but was never detected in the serum. The grafts had inhibitory activity in vitro against S. aureus and the biofilm phase of Staphylococcus epidermidis for up to 3 days and against Escherichia coli for 2 days. Pigs given intravenous rifampin had a significantly lower infection rate than had control pigs (7/12 vs 13/13; p = 0.02); those receiving the rifampin graft had a lower rate (2/13) than had either the control pigs (p < 0.001) or those given intravenous rifampin (p < 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: This simple method of graft impregnation resulted in antibiotic retention for 3 days and appeared to be superior to intravenous antibiotic administration in preventing perioperative graft infection.
