Administration of neutralizing monoclonal antibody to gamma interferon increased Theiler's virus-induced demyelination and virus antigen persistence in the spinal cord in susceptible SJL/J mice and completely abrogated resistance such that all C57BL/10SNJ mice developed demyelination. These experiments support the hypothesis that gamma interferon is critically important for resistance to Theiler's virus-induced disease but is not required for myelin destruction.
