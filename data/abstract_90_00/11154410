The susceptibility of a total of 70 Candida albicans strains to five common antifungal agents was determined. Thirty-five of the strains were isolated from persistent cases of apical periodontitis and 35 from cases of marginal periodontitis. The susceptibility of the strains to amphotericin B, 5-fluorocytosine and three azoles: fluconazole, miconazole and clotrimazole, was tested. The antifungal agents and yeast inoculums were prepared according to the NCCLS (National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards) recommendations. The yeasts were incubated with ten different concentrations of antifungal agents at 35 degrees C for 48 h. Yeast growth was measured spectrophotometrically. All strains from both isolation sources were susceptible to low concentrations of amphotericin B and 5-fluorocytosine, whereas the susceptibility to the three azoles varied, and three of the strains showed azole cross-resistance. These findings are in agreement with recent reports of increased azole resistance in Candida species in general and suggest the possibility that the oral cavity may act as a reservoir of resistant yeast isolates in systemic infections.
