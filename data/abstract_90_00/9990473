A total of 4241 consecutive clinical bacterial isolates from 10 North American medical centers were tested for susceptibility to trovafloxacin. Trovafloxacin was significantly more active than ciprofloxacin against Gram-positive bacteria, Acinetobacter spp., and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and resistance to trovafloxacin occurred in these groups only among isolates with high-level resistance (MIC > or = 16 micrograms/mL) to ciprofloxacin. With other species, the two drugs had comparable activity. Concerns about staphylococci and Pseudomonas aeruginosa with trovafloxacin MICs of 2.0 micrograms/mL (the upper end of the susceptible category) are discussed. Results of trovafloxacin disk diffusion test on more than 3200 nonfastidious isolates supported the FDA-approved zone size interpretive criteria when the MIC breakpoint of < or = 2.0 micrograms/mL is used to define the trovafloxacin-susceptible category.
