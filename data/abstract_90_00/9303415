Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was taken from 19 children with bacterial meningitis treated with cefotaxime (300 mg/kg of body weight/day) and vancomycin (60 mg/kg/day). Median levels of drugs in CSF were smaller than expected, as follows: 4.4 microg/ml for cefotaxime, 3.2 microg/ml for desacetylcefotaxime, and 1.7 microg/ml for vancomycin. The median CSF bactericidal titer against an intermediately cefotaxime-resistant pneumococcus was 1:4. Our data suggest at least an additive interaction between the drugs used in this study.
