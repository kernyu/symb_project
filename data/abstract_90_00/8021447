Resistance to most of the antimicrobial agents in use today is present in Latin America as of this publication. Their underlying mechanisms are in place and an even more serious situation is foreseen in the years to come. Both nosocomial and common community-acquired infections have changed to require more complex ways of management. Although newer antibiotics take the place of the older ones, wiser and more restrictive usage of the currently available antibiotics is needed. This may be obtained through education and with the amplification of national and supranational networks of surveillance, which could anticipate trends in resistance.
