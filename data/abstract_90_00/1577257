The mechanism of synergy between vancomycin and penicillin, as well as other beta-lactam antibiotics, was examined in a penicillin-resistant E. faecium (D366) expressing an inducible low-level resistance to vancomycin. It was demonstrated that penicillin per se was not able to reduce the inducible expression of the 39.5-kDa protein (VANB) or the carboxypeptidase activity which are involved in the mechanism of vancomycin resistance of this strain. Assays of competition between 3H-benzylpenicillin and diverse beta-lactam antibiotics suggested as the most likely explanation of the synergy that, once vancomycin resistance has been induced, the high-molecular mass penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), and possibly PBP1 in particular, which have a high affinity for beta-lactam antibiotics, take over the role of the low-affinity PBP5 which is, in the non-induced strain, responsible for beta-lactam resistance.
