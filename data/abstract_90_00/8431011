Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed on 54 epidemiologically unrelated clinical isolates of Acinetobacter baumannii by using a standard agar dilution technique. On the basis of the in vitro activities, imipenem and doxycycline were the most active agents, whereas amikacin, isepamicin, and the new fluorquinolones ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin presented moderate activity. Cephalosporinase activity was found in 98% of the strains, whereas lactamases of TEM type 1 and one with a pI of 7 to 7.5 were present in 16 and 11% of the strains, respectively. Resistance to aminoglycosides was explained by the production of the three classes of aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes, with predominance of aminoglycoside-3'-phosphotransferase VI in 28% of the strains.
