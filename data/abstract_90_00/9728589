Approximately 25 years ago, investigators realized that small cell lung cancer was relatively sensitive to chemotherapy. The results of the initial trials showed that median survival duration in extensive-disease patients treated with combination chemotherapy was 8 to 10 months compared with 6 to 8 weeks for untreated patients. Similarly, in limited-disease patients, treatment with combination chemotherapy was associated with a median survival duration of approximately 12 months, while the median survival was approximately 3 to 4 months in patients treated with surgery or radiation therapy alone. Encouraged by the relatively high response rates and improved survival, investigators have conducted a large number of randomized trials that have tested concepts such as the Goldie-Coldman hypothesis and practical issues including chemotherapy dose and schedule, duration of treatment, and combined modality treatment. Selected randomized trials that have addressed important issues will be discussed in this brief review.
