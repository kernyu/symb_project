During the first twelve months after ciprofloxacin was introduced for clinical use at our institution, 65 new patients were found to be either infected or colonized by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) which were also ciprofloxacin resistant (CR-MRSA). Only 18 of these patients (28%) had been previously exposed to this antibiotic. Nine (50%) of the 18 patients had received ciprofloxacin for treatment for a pathogen other than MRSA. Although the initial cases of colonization or infection with CR-MRSA can be directly related to ciprofloxacin use, many of the subsequent cases of colonization and infection were not the consequence of ciprofloxacin therapy but rather hospital transmission of existing CR-MRSA.
