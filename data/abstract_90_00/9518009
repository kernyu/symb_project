A retrospective review of AIDS-related oesophageal candidiasis was undertaken to identify clinical features helpful in predicting response to azole therapy and patient survival. Patients who had received daily azole prophylaxis against candidiasis were significantly less likely to respond to azole therapy than those who had not (P < 0.001). Patients who had lost > 5% of their body weight in the 2 months before oesophageal candidiasis were less likely to respond to azoles than the others (P < 0.001). Amongst those who had not received daily azoles, patients with a CD4+ cell count < 25/mm3 were less likely to respond to azole treatment (P = 0.05). The median survival beyond oesophageal candidiasis was 18 months. Survival from oesophageal candidiasis was significantly poorer for patients who did not respond to azole therapy but AIDS survival did not differ between azole responders and non-responders. Non-responders who had been taking daily azole prophylaxis had the poorest survival (median = 4 months).
