It was established on isolated rat hearts that adaptation of the organism to stress exposure effectively limits toxic effect of chronic rifampicin administration (7 mg/kg/day for 8 days) and does not affect the depression of contractile function induced by chronic polymyxin B administration (0.12 mg/kg/day for 8 days). Possible mechanism of the effect of organism's adaptation to stress on the resistance of heart to antibiotics is under discussion.
