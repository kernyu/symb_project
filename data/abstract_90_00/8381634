We selected in vitro human immunodeficiency virus type 1 variants that are resistant to each of 2',3'-dideoxycytidine (ddC) and the racemic mixture of 2',3'-dideoxy-3'-thiacytidine (BCH-189). The median effective concentrations of ddC and BCH-189 obtained for the resistant viruses ranged between 10 and 50 times above those for parental wild-type strains, and extensive cross-resistance was observed against 2',3'-dideoxyinosine (ddI) but not 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (AZT). Two dimer compounds, in which either AZT and ddI or AZT and BCH-189 were linked through phosphodiester linkages, did not permit the emergence of variants resistant to BCH-189, ddI, or AZT but were ineffective at inhibiting the replication of AZT-resistant viruses.
