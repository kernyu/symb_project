5,6-cis-Penem derivatives have been synthesized and evaluated as anti-MRSA antibiotics. The cis-penems 5 and 6 showed potent activities against not only MRSA but also a wide variety of bacteria including beta-lactamase-producing microorganisms. These compounds were designed to have high affinity to the penicillin-binding protein 2a of MRSA and to form stable acyl intermediates with beta-lactamases by blocking the deacylating water molecule.
