We examined the adherence characteristics and susceptibility to various antimicrobial agents of 130 strains of Staphylococcus aureus isolated from infective skin lesions and 135 strains of S. aureus isolated from non-infective eczematous lesions of atopic dermatitis (AD) patients. The isolation rate of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) was 27.7% in strains from clinical sources excluding AD and 31.1% in those from AD. Coagulase type II strains were most frequently observed in MRSA strains isolated from all sources excluding AD, and coagulase type III strains were most frequently observed in those isolated from AD. We proposed that antimicrobial treatment for AD patients should be carefully designed to prevent MRSA infection. Plasma coagulation ability was lowest in S. aureus strains isolated from abscesses, suggesting that the lower production of fibrin observed in abscesses may assist the infiltration of neutrophils into skin tissues and that a decrease in plasma coagulation ability may enable abscess formation. Adherence to polypropylene tubes with slime production was most evident in S. aureus strains isolated from felon and least evident in those isolated from cellulitis and lymphangitis. Tube adherence was characteristic of the S. aureus strains attached to superficial skin tissues, but not necessarily for strains that had infiltrated the deep skin tissues. Fusidic acid demonstrated significant antimicrobial activity against the MRSA strains, but rifampicin was the strongest antimicrobial agent.
