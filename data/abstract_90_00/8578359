Multidrug-resistant Salmonella typhi has become a major public health problem. In this study, typhoid fever was diagnosed by isolation of Salmonella typhi from blood or by a positive Widal's reaction in 170 Pakistani children. There were 111 boys (65%) and 59 girls (35%). The average age was 6.2 years; 4 (2%) were less than 1 year old, 78 (46%) were 1 to 5 years old, and 88 (52%) were more than 5 years old. All patients were pretreated with antibiotics. Salmonella typhi was detected by culture in 109 cases (64%), by Widal's test in 84 (49%), and by both in 23 (14%). All 79 isolates that were multidrug resistant were sensitive to ofloxacin, cefotaxime, and ceftriaxone. Clinical features of infections due to resistant S typhi did not differentiate these from other cases of typhoid. Fifty-five infections (70%) due to resistant S typhi were treated with ofloxacin and 24 (30%) with ceftriaxone. Sixteen patients had complications, and all recovered.
