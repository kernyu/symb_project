A series of 1beta-methyl-2-(naphthosultamyl)methyl-carbapenems bearing dicationic groups on the naphthosultamyl moiety was prepared and evaluated for activity against resistant gram-positive bacteria. Based on a combination of excellent in vitro antibacterial activity, acceptable mouse acute toxicity, and a desirable fragmentation pattern on beta-lactam ring opening, the analog 2g (L-786,392) was selected for extended evaluation.
