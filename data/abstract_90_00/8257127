MICs of erythromycin, clarithromycin, and azithromycin for 852 recent clinical isolates were determined by broth microdilution methods. Frequency distribution curves, scattergrams, and regression analyses were used to compare in vitro activities and describe cross-resistance. Clarithromycin was the most active drug against Bacteroides spp. but the least active against Haemophilus influenzae. Azithromycin was most active against H. influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Pasteurella multocida, and Fusobacterium spp. but the least active against Streptococcus spp. and Enterococcus spp. All three drugs had equivalent activities against Staphylococcus spp. and gram-positive anaerobes. None of the three drugs was particularly active against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae or nonfermentative gram-negative bacilli, although concentrations of 4 micrograms of azithromycin per ml inhibited some strains of the family Enterobacteriaceae (particularly Escherichia coli and Citrobacter diversus) and Acinetobacter baumannii. Although relative drug activities varied by organism, organisms relatively susceptible to one were relatively susceptible to all and organisms relatively resistant to one were relatively resistant to all; an exception was fusobacteria, which were usually susceptible only to azithromycin. Cross-susceptibility and cross-resistance were, therefore, the rule (except for Fusobacterium spp.), although the percentage of susceptible organisms could be varied considerably on the basis of the selection of breakpoints.
