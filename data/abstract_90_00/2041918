Mefloquine and halofantrine are quinine-related aminoalcohols recently introduced for the oral treatment (both drugs) and oral chemoprophylaxis (mefloquine) of malaria. Soon after these new drugs were launched the volume of sales testified to the need for alternative treatments in view of the resistance of Plasmodium falciparum to a variety of drugs, including chloroquine, amodiaquine and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine. Quinine remains effective but it is difficult to handle. Both mefloquine and halofantrine are remarkably effective against the intraerythrocytic pathogenic forms of malaria; they also have a rapid and prolonged action and a low toxicity. Halofantrine is sometimes incompletely absorbed. Neurological side-effects, usually moderate, have been reported with mefloquinone. Partial cross-resistance has been demonstrated within each class of antimalarials: aminoalcohols, amino-4-quinoleins (chloroquine, amodiaquine) and antifolics-antifolinics (sulfamides, pyrimethamine, proguanil), but not between the classes. Further studies are necessary concerning the absorption and tolerability of mefloquine and halofantrine, as well as the regional level of P. falciparum sensitivity to these new drugs.
