Actinobacillus (Haemophilus) pleuropneumoniae plasmids were characterized and classified. They were isolated from A pleuropneumoniae strains different in serotype, year isolated, or location from which isolated. Six of 8 plasmids encoded streptomycin (Sm) and sulfonamide (Su) resistance (SmSu). One of the other plasmids, pVM105, encoded ampicillin (Ap) resistance and another, pHM0, encoded no drug resistance. All SmSu plasmids were transferred to Escherichia coli strains by transformation. Among them, pABO and pMS260 were 8.1 kb and incompatible with each other; they were stable in E coli. The other SmSu plasmids, pHM1, pVM104, pVM106, and pKD25, were 4.3 kb and did not replicate stably in E coli. The former SmSu plasmids were mobilized in E coli strains by a plasmid RP4, which belonged to incompatibility (Inc) group P, but the latter plasmids were not. Further, each 8.1-kb SmSu plasmid and each 4.3-kb plasmid had the same respective restriction pattern. These results indicated that there were at least 2 types of SmSu plasmids in A pleuropneumoniae. The 2 types were classified in 2 groups: H1(pMS260 and pABO) and H2(pHM1, pVM104, pVM106, and pKD25). The H1 and H2 plasmids belonged to different Inc groups, and H2 plasmids belonged to a different Inc group from that of pHMO and pVM105.
