The sensitivity in vitro of 348 strains of 18 enteropathogen agents to furazolidone was investigated during the period of 1987-1989. All strains of Shigella sonnei (17), S. flexneri (17), S. boydii (16), Escherichia coli enteropathogen (40), E. coli enteroinvasive (20), Campylobacter jejuni (50), Vibrio cholerae 01 (5), Vibrio cholerae non 01 (5), V. parahaemolyticus (5), V. alginolyticus (2), Aeromonas hydrophila (5), A. caviae (5), A. sobria (5), and Plesiomonas shigelloides (12) were sensitive (MIC < or = 8 mg/l), except a strains of E. coli enteropathogen (MIC 16 mg/l). The 15.5% of the 51 strains of Salmonella enterica belonging to the type I isolated between 1987 and 1989 were resistant (MIC > or = 16 mg/l). A similar degree of resistance was observed in 20 strains of this agent isolated between 1978 and 1980. The 30 strains of Yersinia (including 15 strains of Y. enterocolitica 03) presented extreme values of MICs of 8 and 16 mg/l.
