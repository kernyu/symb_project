One hundred and ninety nine Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae isolates obtained from the respiratory tract of pigs in Belgium (1991-1992) were serotyped using slide agglutination and slide precipitation tests. Biotype 1-serotype 2 and 3 strains were isolated most frequently and represented 36% and 21% of the isolates, respectively. Serotype 9 and serotype 5B strains represented 15% and 10% of the total number of isolates, respectively, while serotypes 7, 8, 10 and 11 were isolated only sporadically. Serotypes 5B, 10 and 11 were isolated for the first time in Belgium. Biotype 2 strains represented 12.5% of the total number and all belonged to the serotype 2. The in vitro susceptibility of 138 strains was determined for ten commonly used antibiotics. For three antibiotics, ampicillin, chloramphenicol, and oxytetracycline, a bimodal distribution of strain sensitivities was observed. A total of 17 strains (12%) were considered to have acquired resistance to one or more of these antibiotics.
