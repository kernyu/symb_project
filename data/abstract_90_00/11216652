Phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI-3K) and p70 S6 kinase (p70S6k) are suggested as important molecules for mediating mitogenic actions of growth factors and cytokines in a variety of cell types. The purpose of the present study was to investigate whether these kinases were involved in mediation of the mitogenic actions of not only the growth factor insulin but also cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and estrogen on rat cultured lactotrophs. Treatment with wortmannin or LY294002, a PI-3K inhibitor, or rapamycin, a p70S6k inhibitor, decreased basal levels of 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU)-labeling indices of lactotrophs in a dose-dependent manner. These inhibitors were effective in blocking an increase in BrdU-labeling indices induced by insulin. LY294002 and rapamycin also suppressed an increase in BrdU-labeling indices induced by forskolin, an adenylate cyclase activator, or dibutyryl cAMP, a membrane-permeable cAMP analog, as well as that induced by estradiol, a physiologic extracellular activator of lactotroph proliferation. However, the dibutyryl cAMP-, but not insulin-induced proliferation, acquired a resistance to LY294002 and rapamycin by pretreatment with bromocriptine, a dopaminergic agonist that is able to suppress lactotroph proliferation. These results suggest that the mitogenic actions of cAMP and estradiol on rat lactotrophs are mediated by PI-3K and p70S6k, and that dopaminergic inhibition modifies the PI-3K and p70S6k dependence of the regulation of lactotroph proliferation.
