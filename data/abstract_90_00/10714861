One hundred and fifty-nine cases of clinical Staphylococcus aureus mastitis were analyzed to detect factors associated with bacteriological cure after therapy. On 100 Dutch dairy farms, data were collected from four clinical trials with five intramammary treatment regimes designed to treat beta-lactamase-positive pathogens. Infected quarters were treated three times, with a 12-h interval between treatments. Treatment was extended for 2 d if results of the trial treatment were, according to the owner, not satisfactory. The overall bacteriological cure rate was 52%. The bacteriological cure rate of clinical beta-lactamase-negative S. aureus mastitis was significantly higher than that of clinical beta-lactamase-positive S. aureus mastitis. Bacteriological cure was also significantly higher if somatic cell count of the cow was low at the milk recording prior to the onset of the clinical mastitis. The bacteriological cure rate of clinical beta-lactamase-negative S. aureus mastitis was also significantly higher after an extended treatment compared with no extended treatment. The seriousness of the various clinical symptoms and the bacteriological cure rate of clinical S. aureus mastitis were not associated.
