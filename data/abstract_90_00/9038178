Sterol 14alpha-demethylase (P45051) is the target for azole antifungal compounds, and resistance to these drugs and agrochemicals is of significant practical importance. We undertook site-directed mutagenesis of the Candida albicans P45051 heterologously expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae to probe a model structure for the enzyme. The change T315A reduced enzyme activity 2-fold as predicted for the removal of the residue that formed a hydrogen bond with the 3-OH of the sterol substrate and helped to locate it in the active site. This alteration perturbed the heme environment, causing an altered reduced carbon monoxide difference spectrum with a maximum at 445 nm. The changes also reduced the affinity of the enzyme for the azole antifungals ketoconazole and fluconazole and after expression induced by galactose caused 4-5-fold azole resistance in transformants of S. cerevisiae. This is the first example of a single base change in the target enzyme conferring resistance to azoles through reduced azole affinity.
