Exsheathed L3 larvae of Haemonchus contortus were cultured at 38.5 degrees C in a complex medium supporting growth to adult worms. Although there was a clear difference in response between susceptible and benzimidazole/ivermectin/closantel resistant H. contortus using thiabendazole, the test failed to differentiate satisfactorily between the strains using ivermectin or closantel.
