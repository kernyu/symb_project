The incidence of antimicrobial resistance and expression of imipenem-inducible beta-lactamase were examined in 22 strains of non-aeruginosa Pseudomonas isolated from clinical specimens. The percentage of strains resistant to form one to eight antibiotics was 45. The most active antibiotics against all strains were norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin and imipenem. Eighteen out of the 22 strains were positive for beta-lactamase in a spectrophotometric assay using nitrocefin as substrate. A low inducible beta-lactamase specific activity (0.001-0.999 nmoles nitrocefin hydrolyzed/min/mg protein) was found in twelve strains whereas six strains had a relatively high specific activity (3.5-159.8 nmoles nitrocefin hydrolyzed/min/mg protein). Five strains representing different Pseudomonas spp. and showing high beta-lactamase activity were studied further. Crude enzymes from two species (Pseudomonas mendocina, Pseudomonas acidovorans) hydrolyzed cefazolin at a higher rate than penicillin and ampicillin. All enzymes from the five species were inhibited by cloxacillin and p-chloromercuribenzoate (1 mM), but were insensitive to inhibition by clavulanic acid, ethylenediamine acetic acid (EDTA) at the same concentration. The isoelectric point and molecular weight of the main beta-lactamase band from the 5 species were 6.5-6.8 and 47,000 respectively.
