In retrospective analysis of 48 patients with chronic pulmonary tuberculosis we concluded that in spite of increasing drug resistance to first line drugs only 52% chronics received other than first line antituberculous drugs. Our treatment was based on the selection of drugs according to susceptibility tests. 4-6 drugs were used at the beginning of treatment. 13 patient were excluded of the group. Of remaining 35 chronics sputum conversion was achieved in 30 cases (85.7%). Our successful treatment of patients with chronic tuberculosis was based on the following principles: treatment with other than first line antituberculous drugs and treatment with the combination of 5 or 6 drugs selected on susceptibility tests in the initial phase continuing with 2-3 drugs for 12-18 months after sputum conversion. Ofloxacin improves the efficacy of regimens used for treatment of chronic tuberculosis.
