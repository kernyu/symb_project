The effects of bacterial masses upon the drug resistance of neighboring bacteria were investigated. The experiments were performed with plastic Petri dishes divided into two identical compartments. A growing mass of Bacillus subtilis (signal emitter cell) in one compartment exerted enhancing effects upon the erythromycin and streptomycin resistance of Bacillus carboniphilus (signal recipient) cells, sparsely seeded in the other compartment, through the plastic wall and the air. These effects of the growing mass of cells are attributed to the emission of "sonic" signals.
