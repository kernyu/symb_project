Twelve strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae were serially exposed to increasing concentrations of levofloxacin, temafloxacin, ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin for five passages. Wild-type and passaged strains were tested for susceptibility to quinolones, macrolide and penicillin G. The MIC90 data showed a 2-fold increase for levofloxacin but a 32-fold increase for ciprofloxacin, a 16-fold increase for temafloxacin and an 8-fold increase for norfloxacin. Among 16 ciprofloxacin-induced resistant strains, 14 were susceptible to levofloxacin. No cross-resistance to other antibiotics was observed.
