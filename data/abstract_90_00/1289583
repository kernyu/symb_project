Cefprozil (CFPZ, BMY-28100) fine granules were given orally to 21 children with acute bacterial infections including 15 cases of acute tonsillitis and 3 each of acute bronchitis and urinary tract infections. Good to excellent clinical responses were obtained in 19 of the 21 patients and bacterial eradications were obtained for all 11 strains found in these cases. Loose stool and eosinophilia were observed in 1 case each. From the above clinical results, it appears that CFPZ is a useful antibiotic for the treatment of pediatric patients with various bacterial infections.
