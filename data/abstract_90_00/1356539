Resistance to pyrimethamine and proguanil is due to a single point mutation in the gene that codes for dihydrofolate reductase. A single mutation gives rise to resistance to only one of the drugs. Resistance to both drugs results from several mutations. Chloroquine resistance phenotype is due to a rapid efflux of the drug from the parasite's digestive vacuole. This efflux is associated with a transmembrane permeability glycoprotein, or P-gp, which is similar to the protein implicated in the multidrug resistant phenotype of some cancer cells. However, one or several other poorly understood major gene(s) may be involved. Drugs which can inhibit the supposed affinity of P-gp for chloroquine are under study.
