The purpose of this study was to evaluate the risk factors which lead to death due to highly critical staphylococcic enteritis manifested by high fever, large amount of watery diarrhea and gastric secretion with leukopenia and lymphocytopenia after surgical procedures. We experienced eight cases of severe staphylococcic enteritis by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) occurred in the early days after operation from 1986 to 1990. Seven out of eight cases underwent gastrectomy due to gastric cancer. Oral antibiotics were administered in five out of eight cases as the preparation of gastrointestinal tract. Five had been injected the third-generation cephalosporin (CZX) as prophylactic antibiotic administration. In hematological examination, leukopenia and lymphocytopenia were observed in five cases (62.5%) who died soon after operation. So as to prevent the occurrence of MRSA enteritis, it is important to avoid using third-generation cephalosporin after gastrectomy.
