Streptomyces ambofaciens RP181110 produces the macrolide antibiotic spiramycin. After treatment with ethidium bromide, 7 strains presenting an amplified sequence of DNA (ADS) were found in its progeny. These ADS were localized within the same amplifiable region of the RP181110 genome. It has been established that these amplified strains were non-producers (Spi-) and that the loss of one particular ADS was correlated with restoration of spiramycin production. Genome rearrangements such as deletions were detected on the same side of the amplifiable region in both amplified and deamplified strains.
