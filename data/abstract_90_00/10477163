Both gemcitabine (2',2'-difluorodeoxycytidine, dFdC) and cisplatin (cis-diammine-dichloroplatinum) have significant anticancer activity against ovarian, head and neck, and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). dFdC can be incorporated into DNA and RNA, and inhibit DNA repair, while cisplatin can form Pt-DNA adducts. We previously observed schedule-dependent synergism of the combination of dFdC and cisplatin in monolayer cell cultures. We now evaluated whether the combination would also enable selective cell kill in multilayered postconfluent cell cultures, since each compound showed variable activity in multilayered cells. The combination was tested in multilayered cultures from cell lines with a different histological origin: the human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cell line UMSCC-22B (22B), the human NSCLC cell line H322, and ADDP, a cisplatin-resistant variant of the human ovarian cancer cell line A2780. Sensitivity of the multilayered cells was dependent on exposure duration and sequence of the drug combinations, which were added in a constant molar ratio (dFdC:cisplatin 1:100), with a total exposure time of 96 h. The type of interaction was related to the degree of resistance of the cell lines to either dFdC or cisplatin. Thus, the very sensitive 22B cells only showed an additive effect when cells were preincubated for 24 h with dFdC prior to exposure to the combination. In contrast, in the resistant ADDP and H322 cells, synergism was the most common profile (three out of four schedules tested). This is of special relevance when we take into account that these drugs only show cytostatic effects when administered alone, whereas the combination produced cytotoxic cell killing. In conclusion, combining dFdC with cisplatin can be at least additive, but synergistic in multilayered postconfluent cells resistant to dFdC and cisplatin.
