OBJECTIVE: We evaluated pertinent features of impetigo in French Guyana due to the increasing number of therapeutic failures with macrolides and fusidic acid. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A prospective study study was conducted over a 14-month period in the dermatology unit of the Cayenne hospital. Two groups of patients were identified: group 1 included patients with impetigo and group 2 patients with infected skin reactions. Epidemiological, bacteriological, toxinological (exofoliatines, leukocidine) and antibiotic data were recorded. RESULTS: Forty-one patients with impetigo and 31 patients with infected skin reactions were included. Staphylococcus infection alone was identified in most patients (68 p. 100) in the impetigo group. Exfoliatine-producing strains were strongly associated with Staphylococcus-induced bullous and non-bullous impetigo (93 p. 100) compared with other origins (impetigo with streptococcal infection or infected skin reactions). Resistance to macrolides was high (erythromycin 41 p. 100, fusidic acid 42 p. 100) for all isolated strains of Staphylococcus aureus. CONCLUSION: A sub-group of patients with impetigo was identified. These patients had pure staphylococcal infections characterized by strong association with exfoliatine production. The rate of resistance to macrolides was particularly high in this sub-group. Resistance to fusidic acid was high for all Staphylococcus strains isolated.
