BACKGROUND: The mechanism by which ethanol predisposes to acute pancreatitis, especially in established chronic pancreatitis, is not known. Here we studied the effects of acute ethanol ingestion on pancreatic blood flow in chronic pancreatitis, a setting characterized by diminished basal blood flow to the pancreas. METHODS: Obstructive pancreatitis was created by partial duct ligation for 3 weeks in nine cats. Controls (n = 8) were not operated on. Blood flow was measured in anesthetized animals with a hydrogen gas clearance technique and an intraductal electrode. Pancreatic interstitial pressure, systemic and portal blood pressures, and serum ethanol levels were recorded, and pancreatic vascular resistance was calculated. Measurements were made before and for 2 hours after 20 cc of 40% (wt/vol) ethanol was instilled into the stomach. RESULTS: Basal flow was reduced in the obstructed pancreas to 51% of normal. Both groups showed an acute decrease in blood flow when ethanol was given. A more steep (50% of baseline) and a more prolonged (120 minutes) fall was observed in the pancreatitis group than in controls (31% and 60 minutes, respectively). The decline in blood flow correlated with increases in interstitial pressure and vascular resistance. CONCLUSIONS: Acute ethanol ingestion sharply reduces pancreatic blood flow, especially in glands with chronic pancreatitis.
