Lysozyme was administered to 57 patients with lupus erythematosus (LE) for 10 days according to 4 schemes: Group 1 (n = 10)--30 mg of lysozyme 3 times a day sublingually; Group 2 (n = 10)--100 mg daily i.m.; Group 3 (n = 10)--100 mg twice a day i.m.; Group 4 (n = 27)--100 mg 3 times a day i.m. After a course of lysozyme therapy patients with discoid and disseminated LE were prescribed delagil, those with systemic LE were administered corticosteroid hormones in moderate doses or presocyl. The treatment was well tolerated, only 2 (3.5%) patients developed toxicoderma. The results evidence that lysozyme efficacy is not inferior to that of levamisole but this agent is better tolerated. Clinical and paraclinical efficacy was higher in Groups 1 and 4; cellular, humoral, and local immunity parameters, as well as the characteristics reflecting the inflammatory processes evidence positive changes developing as a result of lysozyme therapy, these changes persisting in the majority of cases during further combined treatment. Therapy with low doses of lysozyme is indicated for patients with the immune status disorders mainly. If changes in the nonspecific resistance predominate, the scheme used in Group 4 is advisable.
