Antibiotic susceptibility testing against 17 antibiotics was done on 96 strains of various species of coagulase negative staphylococci by Stokes method. Hundred per cent sensitivity was found against vancomycin and cefotaxime and about 90 per cent against ciprofloxacin, clavulanate potentiated amoxycillin, cloxacillin and clindamycin. Strains showed highest resistance against cotrimoxazole (77.08%) and tetracycline (64.59%). Clavulanate potentiated amoxycillin was found to be highly active against penicillin, ampicillin and amoxycillin resistant organisms. The results highlight the importance of antibiotic resistance typing among coagulase negative staphylococci species which are increasingly being reported from serious clinical infections making empiric therapy and selection of antibiotics difficult in these infections.
