Six dialysed patients affected by tuberculosis involving the respiratory apparatus were included in the study. Antimycobacterial treatment consisted of polychemiotherapeutic combinations using terizidone (TZ). The need to resort to this drug may be explained by the need to exclude normally used drugs (R/AMP, INH, SM) due to resistance, allergy or organ meiopragia. Five patients received terizidone at a dose of 600-900 mg/day for the entire course of treatment, whereas it was necessary to abandon treatment in one patient due to the onset of depressive symptoms which then rapidly regressed following the suspension of TZ therapy. The good level of tolerance demonstrated in the 5 remaining cases confirm the inclusion of this drug in the treatment of a limited number of cases of tuberculosis in dialysed patients.
