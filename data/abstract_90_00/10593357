Several new agents for treating viral infections have been developed in recent years. All available agents are virustatic, inhibiting specific steps in the process of viral replication. No agent is active against nonreplicating or latent viruses. Acyclovir is useful in the treatment of genital herpes, herpes simplex encephalitis, mucocutaneous herpetic infection, varicella infection in the immunosuppressed host, and herpes zoster infection in the normal and the immunosuppressed host. It can also be used for prevention of herpesvirus infection in immunocompromised patients. Ganciclovir is indicated for the treatment of cytomegalovirus retinitis in patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and is effective in the treatment and prevention of cytomegalovirus infection in other immunocompromised patients. Famciclovir and valacyclovir are effective in the management of herpes simplex and varicella-zoster infection. Amantadine and rimantadine are useful therapeutically and prophylactically in the management of influenza A virus infection. Chronic hepatitis B infection can respond to lamivudine therapy, and the optimal treatment of hepatitis C is the combination of interferon alfa and ribavirin. Despite pronounced toxic effects, foscarnet and cidofovir are effective antiviral agents in specific settings.
