Antibacterial quinolones are thought to inhibit DNA gyrase by trapping the enzyme as a complex with the DNA substrate. The precise molecular details of drug-DNA and drug-enzyme interactions remain controversial. Here, a model is proposed that accounts for the influence of magnesium ions on quinolone-DNA binding.
