To improve the scheme for the therapy of malleus, the possible development of fluoroquinolone resistance in the cells of Pseudomonas mallei was studied. The frequency of the mutations determining the resistance to oxolinic acid, norfloxacin, enoxacin, ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin was detected. The spectrum of the cross resistance in the strains was investigated. The influence of the resistance mutations on the culture virulence was studied. Recommendations on the rational use of fluoroquinolones in the treatment of malleus are presented.
