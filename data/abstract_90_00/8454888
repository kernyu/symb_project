Thirty-six consecutively observed HIV-seropositive patients with tuberculosis, including 31 patients with AIDS, who received antituberculous treatment, were followed up to evaluate its efficacy. Treatment with standard antituberculous regimens was intended except when an individual's condition required a modified therapeutic approach. Therapeutic failure occurred in five patients (14%) while on treatment, one also had a post-treatment relapse. Treatment failure was associated with drug resistance and non-compliance in three patients and in another two, both of whom died early in the course of their disease, with HIV-related conditions other than tuberculosis. The median relapse-free post-treatment follow-up time in 24 patients in whom treatment did not fail was 13 months (range 4-67). Standard antituberculous treatment is highly effective in the immediate and long-term treatment of HIV-related tuberculosis provided that drug susceptibility and treatment compliance are confirmed.
