Fluconazole activity against four strains of Candida albicans (three isolates from AIDS patients and one azole-resistant isolate, NCPF 3363) was studied in a turkey crop infection model. Isolate NCPF 3363 showed confirmed azole resistance in vitro and in vivo. Two isolates from AIDS patients were susceptible to fluconazole in vitro and in vivo. The third isolate was resistant to fluconazole in vitro (MIC = 100 micrograms ml-1), insensitive to 2.5 mg kg-1 but sensitive in vivo to a 5 mg kg-1 daily dose.
