Resistance to expanded-spectrum cephalosporins commonly develops in Enterobacter aerogenes during therapy due to selection of mutants producing high levels of the chromosomal Bush group 1 beta-lactamase. Recently, resistant strains producing plasmid-mediated extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) have been isolated as well. A study was designed to investigate ESBL production among 31 clinical isolates of E. aerogenes from Richmond, Va., with decreased susceptibility to expanded-spectrum cephalosporins and a positive double-disk potentiation test. Antibiotic susceptibility was determined by standard disk diffusion and agar dilution procedures. Beta-lactamases were investigated by an isoelectric focusing overlay technique which simultaneously determined isoelectric points (pIs) and substrate or inhibitor profiles. Decreased susceptibility to cefotaxime, ceftazidime, and aztreonam (MIC range, 1 to 64 microg/ml) was detected and associated with resistance to gentamicin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. All strains produced an inducible Bush group 1 beta-lactamase (pI 83). Twenty-nine of the 31 isolates also produced an enzyme similar to SHV-4 (pI 7.8), while 1 isolate each produced an enzyme similar to SHV-3 (pI 6.9) and to SHV-5 (pI 8.2). The three different SHV-derived ESBLs were transferred by transconjugation to Escherichia coli C600N and amplified by PCR. Plasmid profiles of the clinical isolates showed a variety of different large plasmids. Because of the linkage of resistance to aminoglycosides and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole with ESBL production, it is possible that the usage of these drugs was responsible for selecting plasmid-mediated resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins in E. aerogenes. Furthermore, it is important that strains such as these be recognized, because they can be responsible for institutional spread of resistance genes.
