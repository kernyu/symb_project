Previous studies have shown that licochalcone A, an oxygenated chalcone, exhibits antileishmanial and antimalarial activities. The present study was designed to examine the antimalarial activity of an analog of licochalcone A, 2,4-dimethoxy-4'-butoxychalcone (2,4mbc). 2,4mbc inhibited the in vitro growth of both a chloroquine-susceptible (3D7) and a chloroquine-resistant (Dd2) strain of Plasmodium falciparum in a [3H]hypoxanthine uptake assay. The in vivo activity of 2,4mbc was tested in mice infected with Plasmodium berghei or Plasmodium yoelii and in rats infected with P. berghei. 2,4mbc administered either orally, intraperitoneally, or subcutaneously for 5 days protected the mice from otherwise lethal infections of these parasites. 2,4mbc administered orally for 5 days reduced parasitemia in the rats infected with P. berghei. These results demonstrate that 2,4mbc exhibits potent antimalarial activity and might be developed into a new antimalarial drug.
