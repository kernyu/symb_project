The MICs for and disk susceptibilities of 80 strains of yersiniae isolated from swine and pork products were determined. The most effective antimicrobial agents in the in vitro tests were the aminoglycosides, cephalosporins (cefotaxime, ceftazidime, and ceftriaxone), imipenem, ticarcillin-clavulanic acid, aztreonam, ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. There was a high percentage of resistance among the strains to penicillinase-sensitive penicillins, erythromycin, clindamycin, vancomycin, cefazolin, and cephalothin.
