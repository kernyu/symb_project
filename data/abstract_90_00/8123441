To evaluate whether oral CyA may produce changes in the renal vascular bed of the graft, a prospective study was made in 16 children with kidney transplant and normal renal function. A exam with echo-Doppler was realized pre and post two hour after CyA was administered. The doses of CyA was 6.1 +/- 2.7 mg/kg/days (3 doses). The results show that CyA produced in the children with kidney transplant an increase of vascular resistance (renal and interlobar) and a decrease transient of urinary flow. The finding changes in relation to time of administration of the CyA.
