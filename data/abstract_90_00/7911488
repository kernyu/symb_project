Staphylococcus aureus, especially methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) is an important nosocomial pathogen. A problem encountered in the control of staphylococcal nosocomial infection is the difficulty correlating data available from antimicrobial susceptibility patterns (usually available locally) with phage typing patterns which are generally determined in a reference laboratory. Data problems are exaggerated because many patients have numerous samples taken over long periods of time. This paper describes the use of a database, 'DataEase', on a personal computer to correlate available data with patient demographics and to present the resulting information in whatever format is required. The information might be presented as the phage pattern of each isolate from patients in a particular unit per month or as a combination of the phage types and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of isolates from a particular unit. The system can be used to generate a list of all isolates for phage typing in a format that allows the phage typing pattern to be recorded directly onto the list worksheet. In addition to providing clinically relevant reports, the system simplifies the collation of epidemiological information, data from which showed that since 1987 the incidence of MRSA has been rising in the group of hospitals served by this laboratory; MRSA of phage type 83A became a problem during 1990 and 1991; the incidence of gentamicin-sensitive phage type non-typable MRSA increased fourfold between 1988 and 1991; and the incidence of gentamicin-resistant MRSA rose sharply in 1992.
