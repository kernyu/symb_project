The influence of antibiotics, particularly ofloxacin (OF), a commonly used antimicrobial fluoroquinolone, on the multidrug resistance (MDR) phenotype of the HCT-8 cell line was studied. This cell line was grown in OF containing medium for several months and the expression of the MDR phenotype was followed through the analysis of the expression and functionality of the P-glycoprotein (Pgp), the chemosensitivity to daunorubicin (DNR), and the mRNA expression of mdr-1, multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP), and topoisomerase IIalpha and IIbeta genes. Replacement of OF by penicillin streptomycin (PS) resulted in a significant decrease in mdr-1 mRNA expression, which was found to correlate with a decrease in the expression and functionality of the Pgp. After antibiotic starvation for 4 weeks, cells grown in antibiotic-free medium were then exposed to PS or OF; these cells showed an increase in mdr-1 mRNA/Pgp and MRP mRNA expression without a decrease in DNR cytotoxicity. OF cultured cells exhibited a significant increase in Pgp expression without evidence of the functionality of the Pgp. An increase in topoisomerase IIalpha mRNA expression was observed with time and with the number of passages of the cell line without any relationship to the presence of antibiotics in the culture medium. These results showed that extensive use of antibiotics, particularly the quinolones, can modify the phenotype of the HCT-8 colon adenocarcinoma cell line.
