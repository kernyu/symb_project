The change in resistance of Burkholderia cepacia to ceftazidime and to ciprofloxacin during the exponential phase and up to the onset of stationary phase was assessed along the growth curve in batch culture. B. cepacia was grown in planktonic culture and in a biofilm on a membrane support. Resistance increased progressively during the exponential phase, being increased by ten-fold about every four generations. Bacteria grown in a biofilm were about 15 times more resistant than equivalent planktonic-grown bacteria. The growth rate was not the key factor for the development of resistance. The growth phase and the mode of growth have a fundamental impact on the susceptibility of B. cepacia towards antimicrobial agents. Bacteria growing at the same rate may differ greatly in their resistance to antimicrobial agents.
