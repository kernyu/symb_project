Basil and sage essential oils were examined for bactericidal activity against a range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria by viable count determinations. Generally, Gram-positive bacteria showed higher resistance to basil and sage essential oils than Gram-negative bacteria. Vibrio species showed a high sensitivity to both essential oils. Stationary growth phase cells of selected bacteria showed higher resistance to these essential oils than exponential growth phase cells. Basil-resistant (b21) and sage-resistant (s20) strains of Vibrio parahaemolyticus were isolated. Both strains showed higher resistance to heat and H2O2 than parent strain. Conversely, heat-adapted V. parahaemolyticus also showed a higher resistance to these essential oils than nonadapted cells.
