The potential for use of the cytochrome-pathway electron-transfer inhibitors antimycin A and myxothiazol in the selection of plant mitochondrial genome transformants was investigated. The net growth of Nicotiana tabacum L. (tobacco) suspension-culture cells was reduced by these inhibitors, but complete repression of cell growth occurred only in the presence of both cytochrome and alternative electron-transfer-pathway inhibitors. Antimycin A and myxothiazol bind to and block electron transfer through different sites in the cytochrome b (COB) subunit of the mitochondrial bc1 respiratory complex (complex III). The nucleotide sequence of the tobacco cob gene was determined and found to predict highly conserved glycine and phenylalanine residues that are associated with sensitivity to antimycin A and myxothiazol, respectively. These residues are altered by mutations that confer resistance to antimycin A or myxothiazol in diverse organisms. Tobacco cob cDNA clones were constructed and sequenced, revealing eight full and 11 partial RNA-editing sites. RNA editing did not, however, alter codons for the conserved glycine and phenylalanine residues associated with sensitivity to the respiratory inhibitors. Antimycin A or myxothiazol, in conjunction with a modified cob gene, may therefore be useful in the selection of tobacco cells carrying a genetically transformed mitochondrial genome.
