Burn wound and systemic infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) were analysed in 95 patients. Results showed that both 95 (92.2%) out of 103 strains of Staphylococcus aureus isolated from burn wound and all 17 strains from blood were MRSA. Wound MRSA infection could be found in patients with variety of severity and in any kind of wound, while systemic MRSA infection was often occurred in extensive burn patients. The isolated MRSA were most resistant to cephalosporins and sensitive to vancomycin. In order to control wound MRSA infection, Lysostaphin which is active against these organisms could be used as a topical antimicrobial.
