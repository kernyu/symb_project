Pharmacokinetic parameters were determined for imipenem-cilastatin and a carbapenem antibiotic, L-695,256, active against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in rhesus monkeys and a chimpanzee. L-695,256 had larger areas under the concentration-time curve than imipenem-cilastatin (30 +/- 5 versus 24 +/- 1 micrograms.h/ml in the rhesus monkeys and 77 versus 60 micrograms.h/ml in the chimpanzee) and a longer half-life at beta phase (1.2 +/- 0.1 versus 0.6 +/- 0.1 h in the rhesus monkeys and 1.0 versus 0.8 h in the chimpanzee). Resistance to hydrolysis by the renal dehydropeptidase-I allowed L-695,256 to be administered as a single agent.
