A cross-sectional study was carried out by the bacteriology laboratory of the Lome-Tokoin University Hospital, to determine the frequency of gonorrhea in patients providing vaginal or urethral samples, and to investigate the susceptibility of N. gonorrhoeae to antibiotics. The samples were treated according to classic bacteriological methods and the disk diffusion tests were used to investigate antibiotic susceptibility. The samples were taken from 420 patients, 246 of whom were male (26.86% inverted question markNdT: d'ou vient ce chiffre??, 58.33% si 420 patients, 61.19% si 402 patients inverted question mark) and 156 of whom were female (37.14% inverted question markNdT: plutot 38.8% si 402 patients inverted question mark) inverted question markNdT: et le reste?? Il me semble que c'est plutot 402 patients en total (= 246 + 156). Sinon il y a 18 patients qui ne sont ni male ni femelle?! inverted question mark. N. gonorrhoeae was isolated from 88 patients, giving a prevalence of 20.95% inverted question markNdT: ou 21.89% si 402 patients inverted question mark. We isolated strains of the bacterium from 76 men (25.78% inverted question markNdT: incorrect, 30. 89% inverted question mark and 12 women (7.69%). Ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin and netilmicin were the most effective antibiotics. The cyclins, cotrimoxazole and penicillin were less effective.
