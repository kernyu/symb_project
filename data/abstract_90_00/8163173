Two macrolide-resistance determinants were cloned from a mycinamicin (Mm)-producing Micromonospora griseorubida strain in Streptomyces lividans and Streptomyces parvulus. One of the cloned genes, designated myrA, was cloned as a gene which conferred strong resistance to Mm and tylosin (Ty), but not to erythromycin (Er) or josamycin (Jm) on S. lividans. Another gene, named myrB, was cloned as an ErR-encoding gene which conferred MLS resistance (to macrolide, lincosamide and streptogramine B antibiotics) on S. parvulus. Both myrA and myrB were sequenced and the corresponding ORFs were determined. The deduced amino acid (aa) sequence of myrA showed no similarity to proteins in the available databases, suggesting that an unknown mechanism of macrolide resistance is exerted by the MyrA protein. The deduced aa sequence of myrB exhibited high similarity to 23S rRNA methyltransferases (MTases), such as ErmE and CarB, from a variety of microorganisms.
