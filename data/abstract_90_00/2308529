Cultural examination of cecal contents from 109 market weight hogs slaughtered in Prince Edward Island during May-July 1988 yielded 62 isolates of Campylobacter coli and seven Campylobacter jejuni. A commercial latex agglutination test helped to confirm the identification of Campylobacter. When tested against four drugs: erythromycin, tetracycline, kanamycin and ampicillin, 11 isolates showed multiple resistance. Resistance to erythromycin was seen in 19% and 28.6% of Campylobacter coli and Campylobacter jejuni respectively. All the isolates were susceptible to nitrofurans, gentamicin and chloramphenicol.
