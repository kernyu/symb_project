OBJECTIVE: To determine both the prevalence of group I beta-lactamase-related resistance and the clinical setting in which resistance to expanded-spectrum cephalosporins occurs. METHODS: Isolates of Enterobacter spp. were sensitivity tested to a range of antibiotics, and selected isolates were DNA fingerprinted by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. The medical records of all patients with positive cultures for Enterobacter spp. were reviewed to determine the effect of previous antibiotic treatment on the susceptibility profile of these organisms. RESULTS: The crude incidence of colonization/infection (n = 315) was 0.51 per 100 patients and 0.73 per 1000 days of hospitalization. The 4-day and 7-day Kaplan-Meier rates of colonization/infection with Enterobacter were estimated to be 7.57% (standard deviation (SD = 3.26%) and 4.16% (SD = 2.88%)), respectively. The time lag to colonization/infection with isolates producing large amounts of Bush group 1 beta-lactamase (HLBL) (27.35 +/- 27.30 days) was significantly different from that to colonization/infection with wild-type isolates (13.59 +/- 17.93 days) (P = 0.036). Ninety-six isolates (30.5%) demonstrated acquired resistance to expanded-spectrum cephalosporins: 34 isolates (10.8%) produced extended-spectrum beta-lactamase, and 62 isolates (19.7%) produced HLBL. The 89 Enterobacter isolates susceptible to third-generation cephalosporins yielded 84 major DNA patterns, and the 45 HLBL isolates yielded 38 major DNA patterns. The risk of colonization/infection with HLBL-producing Enterobacter was higher in cases of antimicrobial treatment with third-generation cephalosporins or a fluoroquinolone, and in cases of urinary tract colonization/infection. CONCLUSIONS: The judicious use in hospitals of both expanded-spectrum cephalosporins and other antibiotics such as fluoroquinolones is necessary to curtail the emergence of resistance in Enterobacter spp.
