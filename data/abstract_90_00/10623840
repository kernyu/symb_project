Cytolytic CD8+ effector cells fall into two subpopulations based on cytokine secretion. Type 1 CD8+ T cells (Tc1) secrete IFN-gamma, whereas type 2 CD8+ T cells (Tc2) secrete IL-4, IL-5, and IL-10. Using an OVA-transfected B16 lung metastases model, we assessed the therapeutic effects of adoptively transferred OVA-specific Tc1 and Tc2 subpopulations in mice bearing established pulmonary malignancy. Effector cell-treated mice exhibiting high (5 x 105) tumor burdens experienced significant (p < 0.05) delays in mortality compared with those of untreated control mice, whereas high proportions (70-90%) of mice receiving therapy with low (1 x 105) tumor burdens survived indefinitely. Long-term tumor immunity was evident by resistance to lethal tumor rechallenge, heightened levels of systemic OVA Ag-specific CTL responses ex vivo, and detection of long-lived TCR transgene-positive donor cells accompanied by an elevation in the total numbers of CD8+ CD44high activated and/or memory T cells at sites of tumor growth. Long-lasting protection by Tc2 and Tc1 effector cells were dependent, in part, on both the level of tumor burden and effector cell-derived IL-4, IL-5, and IFN-gamma, respectively. We conclude that Tc1 and Tc2 effector cells provide immunity by different mechanisms that subsequently potentiate host-derived antitumor responses.
