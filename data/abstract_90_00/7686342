A blood vessel's response to denudation injury will determine its final luminal diameter as well as its function. The synthesis, deposition, and remodeling of extracellular matrix components and migration by vascular endothelial cells are major factors in determining luminal diameter, cellular proliferative and migratory responses, and mononuclear cell adhesion at sites of injury. Previously, we have shown that after in vivo and in vitro denudation injury, endothelial cell migration is dramatically influenced by the amount of fibronectin synthesized and deposited by the responding endothelial cell population. The aim of this study was to elucidate the roles of fibronectin in modulating mononuclear cell adhesion to the endothelial cell population during in vitro migration. In this report we demonstrate that U937 cell binding to the migrating fronts of endothelial cell monolayers is modulated by the amount of fibronectin synthesized and deposited by the endothelial cells. Agents which increase fibronectin deposition, such as transforming growth factor-beta 1, elicit greater U937 cell adhesion. Manipulations that decrease fibronectin deposition, such as transfection and overexpression of pp60c-src proto-oncogene in endothelial cells, reduce U937 cell adhesion. These results suggest that changes in endothelial cell extracellular matrix synthesis and deposition modulate, in part, the adhesive properties of the vessel wall after injury. In turn, the intensity and duration of mononuclear cell adhesion at sites of vessel wall injury determines, in part, the vessel wall response.
