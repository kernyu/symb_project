Among cases of infantile acute pharyngolaryngitis with cough as a chief complaint, 21 cases that the involvement of bacterial infections has been demonstrated were given minocycline (MINO) and the effectiveness and safety of MINO were investigated. 1. Regarding the clinical effectiveness, the number of cases assessed as markedly effective was 9 (43%) and that as effective was 8 (38%), so that the effectiveness rate was 81%, and particularly, in the infections caused by Haemophilus influenzae, MINO showed a high effectiveness. 2. Five strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 2 strains of Streptococcus pyogenes and 16 strains of H. influenzae, a total of 23 strains of pathogenic bacteria were isolated, and MINO showed high activities against not less than 80% of these strains. 3. The bacteriological effect in terms of the rate of eradication was 71%, and that of H. influenzae was as high as 88%, while S. pneumoniae remained in 3 of 5 cases. 4. Adverse reactions were observed in 2 cases (10%), 1 case each of abdominal pain and stomatitis, and both of them were improved after the treatment termination. 5. Regarding the usefulness, which was comprehensively assessed using clinical effectiveness and safety as criteria, the number of cases evaluated satisfactorily useful was 8 (38%) and that as useful was 8 (38%), so that the overall usefulness rate was 76%. From the above results, it was confirmed that MINO is a drug having high efficacy and safety against infantile acute pharyngolaryngitis with cough as a chief complaint caused by H. influenzae.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
