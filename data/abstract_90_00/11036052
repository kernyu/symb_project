A strain of Streptococcus pyogenes resistant to multiple fluoroquinolones was isolated from the blood of an immunocompromised patient. Resistance to fluoroquinolones in S. pyogenes has not been previously studied. Compared to 10 sensitive strains of S. pyogenes, the fluoroquinolone-resistant clinical isolate of S. pyogenes presented point mutations in gyrA, predicting that serine-81 was changed to phenylalanine and that methionine-99 was changed to leucine, and in parC, predicting that serine-79 was changed to tyrosine. The mechanism of fluoroquinolone resistance in this isolate of S. pyogenes appears to be analogous to previously reported mechanisms for Streptococcus pneumoniae.
