Murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) has been used extensively as an animal model for human cytomegalovirus (HCMV). Understanding drug resistance and its treatment in MCMV may lead to more effective treatments of HCMV disease. Most ganciclovir-resistant HCMV clinical isolates exhibit a decreased capacity to induce ganciclovir phosphorylation (to its biologically active form) in infected cells. Using an MCMV strain resistant to both ganciclovir and cidofovir, the intracellular metabolism of these drugs was studied to determine if MCMV resistance correlates with decreases in drug phosphorylation. The wild-type (WT) MCMV used for comparison was inhibited in plaque reduction assays, by ganciclovir and cidofovir by 50% at 5.1 and 0.24 microM, respectively; the resistant strain was inhibited at 72 and 2.7 microM, respectively. In uninfected, WT, or resistant virus-infected cells, the extent of metabolism of 10 microM ganciclovir or 1 microM cidofovir to intracellular triphosphorylated species was similar. Phosphorylation and catabolism (following drug removal) rates over time were also similar. Intracellular levels of ganciclovir triphosphate and cidofovir diphosphate increased less than two-fold with increasing multiplicity of virus infection. Because few differences in drug phosphorylation between WT and resistant virus-infected cells were found, virus resistance to ganciclovir and cidofovir apparently is not linked to altered drug phosphorylation. Since the viral DNA polymerase is the antiviral target for these compounds, the resistant MCMV is most likely a DNA polymerase mutant.
