Twelve multiply drug-resistant strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, isolated in Frankfurt University Clinics during the year 1998, transferred determinants of antibiotic resistance with remarkable variability in the host range of transferred plasmids. As a new phenomenon, two of them transferred resistance genes to both groups of recipients, i.e. to Enterobacteriaceae as well as to a strain of P. aeruginosa. Six strains had more restrictive activity and transferred resistance determinants to Enterobacteriaceae only, while four additional strains demonstrated transferability only to P. aeruginosa. Two isolates transferred imipenem resistance and one cefepime resistance. Differences in selection pressure occurring during therapy of individual patients seems to be one of the possible factors influencing the spectrum of antibiotic resistance genes present in P. aeruginosa and their transfer to susceptible strains.
