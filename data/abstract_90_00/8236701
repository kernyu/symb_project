The activity of morantel citrate (5.94 mg/kg base) was determined in laboratory tests against field isolates of benzimidazole-resistant nematodes. Its efficacies against adult and seven-day-old worms were 100 per cent and 100 per cent for Cooperia curticei, 95.1 per cent and 69.8 per cent for Haemonchus contortus and 100 per cent and 82 per cent for Ostertagia circumcincta. Morantel citrate was 100 per cent effective against benzimidazole-susceptible Nematodirus battus and Trichostrongylus vitrinus, and it reduced faecal egg counts by 97.9 per cent in sheep infected naturally with benzimidazole-resistant H contortus and O circumcincta.
