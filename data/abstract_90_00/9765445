Nucleotide sequences of the reverse transcriptase (RT) coding region have been compared in four new human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) group O isolates. Phylogenetic analysis of this pol region highlights a cluster of these four HIV-1 group O sequences with seven other group O isolates (5% intracluster nucleotide sequence diversity) similar to clusters classified as subtypes in HIV-1 group M (an average of 4.9% intrasubtype sequence diversity). Based on these analyses, this group O cluster has been designated subtype A-O. A longitudinal study of a heterosexual couple infected with group O (ESP1 and ESP2) allowed a detailed analysis of RT sequences (amino acids 28 to 219). Directed evolution and a slightly higher mutation frequency was observed in the RT sequences of patient ESP2, treated with antiretroviral drugs, than that from the untreated patient ESP1. Antiretroviral treatment also selected for specific substitutions, M184V and T215Y in the RT coding region, conferring resistance to 3'-dideoxy-3'-thiacytidine and zidovudine, respectively. A Gly98 to Glu RT substitution identified in the treated patient suggests a possible reversion of a nonnucleoside RT inhibitor-resistant phenotype. Using RT clones from this longitudinal study, both heteroduplex tracking assay and cloning-sequencing techniques were employed for an extensive genetic analysis of pol gene quasispecies. Amino acid substitutions (i.e., Phe-77 to Leu, Lys-101 to Glu, and Val-106 to Iso) associated with antiretroviral resistance were identified in RT clones from HIV-1 group O-infected patients not subjected to drug therapy or treated with unrelated drugs. Finally, phylogenetic relationships between RT clones of the treated ESP2 patient and those of the untreated ESP1 patient show how drug pressure can direct evolution of viral pol gene quasispecies independently of direct drug-resistant substitutions.
