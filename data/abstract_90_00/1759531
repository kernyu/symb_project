At the acute period of tick-borne typhus an increase in the activities of the main nonspecific resistance factors of the body, and particularly lysozyme, betalysins, complement and properdin, is observed. During convalescence the concentration of lysozyme normalizes and the content of betalysins remains sufficiently high, this indicating that, even in the absence of clinical sings of the disease, the disturbances in homeostasis persist. A decrease in the levels of complement and properdin during convalescence is seemingly linked with their consumption for the formation of immune complexes, eliminated from the body.
