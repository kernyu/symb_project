We investigated the in vitro activity of a new antifungal triazole, D0870, against 100 Candida albicans isolates from the oral cavities of patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus by using a broth macrodilution method following the recommendations provided by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (document M27-P). All of the isolates were chosen from C. albicans isolates already tested for fluconazole susceptibility by the procedure of the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards. Fifty isolates were considered fluconazole susceptible (MICs, < or = 4 micrograms/ml), and 50 isolates were considered fluconazole resistant (MICs, > or = 8 micrograms/ml). The in vitro data demonstrated that D0870 had good activity against isolates tested; for 90% of all strains of C. albicans, MICs were 0.5 micrograms/ml. However, the D0870 MICs for the fluconazole-susceptible isolates were lower than those for the fluconazole-resistant isolates; MICs for 50 and 90% of the isolates tested were < or = 0.0078 and 0.06 micrograms/ml, respectively, for fluconazole-susceptible isolates and 0.25 and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively, for fluconazole-resistant isolates (P < 0.001). Our data suggest that this new triazole could represent a valid alternative in the treatment of oral candidiasis in human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients.
