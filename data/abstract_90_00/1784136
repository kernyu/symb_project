The aim of the study was to determine a participation of Aeromonas sp., having conjugation R plasmids, in a population of the bacteria present in purified urban sewage . In 1 ml of sewage 1.8 x 10(3) - 50 x 10(3) of Aeromonas sp., were found. The isolated strains belonged to the following genera: A. hydrophila, A. caviae, A. sorbia. All tested strains were sensitive to gentamicin, tetracycline, kanamycin and nalidixic acid. Among 186 strains of Aeromonas sp., two belonging to A. caviae genus transferred resistance to streptomycin to A. hydrophila and E. coli recipients on the other hand two strains of A. caviae transferred resistance to streptomycin exclusively to A. hydrophila recipient.
