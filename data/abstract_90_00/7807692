Twenty-eight patients with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections were clinically studied for the effectiveness of the time-difference combination use of netilmicin (NTL) and minocycline (MINO). The patients were treated with NTL 100 mg and two hours later, with MINO 100 mg intravenously, twice daily, in the morning and evening for 14 days. Of 26 patients, MRSA was eradicated in 16 (61.5%), decreased in one, and unchanged in nine. Superinfections occurred with Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in two patients. The clinical efficacies were assessed in two patients with septicemia, 16 with pneumonia, and eight with chronic bronchitis. The obtained results were excellent in four patients, good in 15, fair in six, and poor in one patient. The rate of effectiveness was 73.1% (19/26). The overall clinical effectiveness judged by the committee was good in 19, fair in five, and poor in two patients. The efficacy rate was also 73.1% (19/26). Coagulase type II of MRSA was found in 23 patients, and coagulase type III in three patients, with overall clinical efficacy rates of 73.9% (17/23) and 66.7% (2/3), respectively. A side effect of eruption was observed in one patient, and its incidence was 3.6% (1/28). Abnormal laboratory test results were observed in 16 patients (57.1%), including abnormal liver function in 14 patients, abnormal kidney function in three, and increased eosinophils in three. Laboratory abnormalities occurred twelve of 16 bedridden patients, and this rate was higher than that in non bedridden patients. However, these abnormalities were all mild, transient, and immediately recovered after the treatment. In conclusion, the time-difference combination therapy using NTL and MINO was effective in the treatment of MRSA infections.
