We are using molecular genetic techniques to identify sites of interaction of beta-tubulin with benzimidizole anti-microtubule agents. We have developed a marker-rescue technique for cloning mutant alleles of the benA, beta-tubulin gene of Aspergillus nidulans and have used the technique to clone two mutant benA alleles, benA16 and benA19. These are the only A. nidulans alleles known to confer resistance to the benzimidazole antimicrotubule agent thiabendazole and supersensitivity to other benzimidazole antimicrotubule agents including benomyl and its active breakdown product, carbendazim. benA16 has been shown, moreover, to reduce thiabendazole binding to beta-tubulin. We have sequenced the two mutant alleles and have found that they carry different nucleotide changes that cause the same single amino acid substitution, valine for alanine at amino acid 165. Since thiabendazole and carbendazim differ at only one side chain, the R2 group, we conclude that the region around amino acid 165 is involved in the binding of the R2 group of benzimidazole antimicrotubule agents to beta-tubulin.
