A wide variety of prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells exhibit a multidrug resistance (MDR) phenotype, indicating that resistance to potentially toxic compounds is mediated by their active efflux from the cell. We have sought to determine whether resistance to azoles in some strains of Candida species may be due in part to active drug efflux. Rhodamine 123 (Rh123) is a fluorescent compound that is transported by a wide variety of MDR cell types. We have shown that certain azole-resistant strains of Candida albicans, C. glabrata, and C. krusei accumulate less Rh123 than azole-susceptible ones. In C. albicans, Rh123 accumulation was growth phase and temperature dependent and was increased by proton uncouplers and by reserpine, an MDR modulator. This is consistent with an energy-dependent efflux mechanism for Rh123, mediated by an MDR transporter. In C. glabrata, but not in C. albicans, there was competition between Rh123 and fluconazole for efflux. Thus, in C. glabrata, Rh123 and fluconazole appear to be transported via a common MDR-like transporter, whereas in C. albicans, the Rh123 transporter does not appear to transport azoles.
