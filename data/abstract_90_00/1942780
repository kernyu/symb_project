Adoptive immunotherapy in patients with advanced cancer produces significant regression of metastatic disease in selected patients, but it is complicated by severe side effects. Prevention of these complications is still limited because their precise mechanisms remain unknown. For this reason we have investigated renal function and hemodynamic parameters in 16 patients with renal cell carcinoma before and during treatment with a combination of high doses of both recombinant interleukin-2 (rIL2) and recombinant alpha-interferon. After patients had received three injections of combined immunotherapy, there was a decrease in mean blood pressure (-20%), glomerular filtration rate (-25%), urine output (-50%), and fractional sodium excretion (-0.8%). This was associated with an increase in heart rate (+30%), plasma creatinine level (+30%), fractional potassium excretion (+14%) and microalbuminuria (+130%). However, renal plasma flow remained constant. The increment in microalbuminuria may reflect an alteration of glomerular capillary permeability. The reduction in GFR may be accounted either for a decrease in efferent to afferent arteriolar resistance ratio, leading to a decrease in glomerular capillary pressure, or for a decrease in ultrafiltration coefficient, or both. Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, such as ketoprofen, used to minimize side effects, could considerably worsen renal function and should be avoided in patients treated by rIL2. Our results bring new insights into the pathogenesis of functional acute renal failure and provide a rational basis for the use of vasopressors in the treatment of cytokine-induced acute renal failure.
