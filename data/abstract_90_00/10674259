Throughout 1996, 22 hospital-based laboratories in the Rhone-Alpes region of France collected pneumococcal strains and used a standardized protocol to record the following data; patient age and sex; type of specimen; and determination of susceptibility to at least the following antibiotics: oxacillin 1 microgram and 5 micrograms, erythromycin (Ery), tetracycline (Tet), chloramphenicol (Chl), rifampin (Rmp), and loracarbef. For penicillin-nonsusceptible strains (PNSSs), which were identified based on results with oxacillin, MICs for penicillin G, amoxicillin (Amx), and cefotaxime (Ctx) were determined using the E Test, at the study site and agar dilution at the coordinating center. Of the 1153 strains, 65.5% were from adults and 31.8% from children; patient age was unknown in 2.7% of cases. PNSPs (MIC > 0.06 mg/l) contributed 32.9% of strains (I: 23.3%; R: 9.6%) and were more common in children (41.1%) than in adults (28.1%). The frequency of PNSSs varied across specimen types: 27.9% in blood cultures (305 strains), 15.6% in cerebrospinal fluid (32), 38.7% in protected bronchopulmonary specimens (31), 31.5% in unprotected bronchopulmonary specimens (434), 50.8% in acute otitis media (118), and 34.4% in other specimens (221). Among PNSSs, nonsusceptibility (I + R) to other antibiotics was variable: Ery, 62.1%; Tet, 41.5%; Chl, 40.4%; Rmp, 1.1%. Corresponding figures for the overall strain population were Ery, 33.3%; Tet, 22.7%; Chl, 22.8%; Rmp, 0.9%. In addition, 56.5% of PNSSs exhibited multiple drug resistance. Resistance to amoxicillin (MIC > 2 mg/l) was demonstrated for only 5 strains. No strains were resistant to loracarbef or cefotaxime. Serotypes of the 379 PNSSs were as follows: 23F, 26.6%; 14 (25.6%); 9V (18.2%), 6 (8.7%), 15 (5%), 19 (4.5%).
