The safety and antiviral activity of the second-generation nonnucleoside inhibitor HBY 097 was investigated in asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1-infected patients in a randomized, double-blinded, dose-escalation study. Mean maximum virus load decreases ranged from -1.31 log10 copies/mL of plasma at week 1 in the group receiving HBY 097 monotherapy (250 mg three times daily) to -2.19 log10 copies/mL at week 4 in the group receiving zidovudine plus HBY 097 (750 mg three times daily). After 12 weeks, these patients had viral RNA copy numbers 1.05 log10 below baseline. Genotypic analysis of resistance development revealed reverse transcriptase K103N variants in most patients, which was associated with less durable efficacy of HBY 097 treatment. Fewer patients receiving combination therapy with high-dose HBY 097 developed the K103N variant (P<.01). HBY 097 caused pronounced acute suppression of HIV-1 replication both in combination with zidovudine and alone. Therefore, sustained antiviral activity can be expected from multiple combination therapy regimens including a quinoxaline derivative.
