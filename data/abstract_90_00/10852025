In this article information on an important role of nitric oxide (NO) in inhibiting the growth of a number of pathogenic microorganisms, including intracellular parasites, and their elimination from the host body is presented. Differences between the mechanisms of the production of NO and free-radical compounds having antimicrobial action are given. The regulation of the activity of constitutive NO-synthase and inducible NO-synthase and the relationship between the latter and the phagocytic activity and production of anti-inflammatory cytokines are described. An important role of NO in the development of the nonspecific resistance of the body is mentioned.
