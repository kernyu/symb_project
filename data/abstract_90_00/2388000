Thirty Staphylococcus aureus isolates from five hospitals were determined to exhibit borderline susceptibility to the antistaphylococcal penicillins. Of the isolates submitted for phage typing, 96% belonged to phage group 94/96, and 96% possessed a common plasmid, pBW15. Also, four reference borderline-susceptible isolates from the Centers for Disease Control belonged to phage group 94/96 and possessed pBW15. Screening of 43 other phage group 94/96 isolates demonstrated that 36 (84%) contained pBW15 and exhibited the borderline phenotype. In contrast, pBW15 was not identified among 10 penicillin-susceptible, 10 methicillin-resistant, and 40 penicillin-resistant but non-borderline-susceptible S. aureus. These data show a close association between pBW15, phage group 94/96, and the borderline-susceptible phenotype. Furthermore, these isolates were associated with infections in multiple institutions, suggesting the widespread dissemination of a clinically important and pathogenic strain of S. aureus.
