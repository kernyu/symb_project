In July, 1996, a massive outbreak of hemorrhagic enterocolitis involving more than 5,000 people was caused by enterohemorragic Escherichia coli (EHEC) O157:H7 occurred mainly among elementary school children of Sakai City, Japan. The antibacterial activities in vitro against EHEC from stool specimens were determined. Norfloxacin showed the highest antibacterial activity, and fosfomycin, kanamycin, ampicillin, cefaclor were considered as effective drugs. But doxycycline showed lower antibacterial activities compared to other examined drugs, and it appears necessary to take antibiotic resistance of Escherichia coli into consideration when a treatment regimen is determined. As a result of the oral administration of fosfomycin to 95 patients of hemorrhagic enterocolitis and carrier, no patients developed complications with hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). However, a study of 17 patients with HUS demonstrated the fact that most of them were subjected to intravenous administration of fosfomycin. It may be needed to consider oral administration route of effective antibiotics in the treatment of enterocolitis in order to maintain high concentrations of a drug in the intestine.
