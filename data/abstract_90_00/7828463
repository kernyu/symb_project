A 48-year-old man with known HIV infection for 4 years was admitted with a 2-week history of increasing brachio-facial paraesthesiae of the left side of the body and pains in the head and neck. Physical examination also showed discrete slowing of mental activity and oral candidiasis. Toxoplasmosis serology showed a low titre with a borderline IgM titre. Cranial computer tomography showed two confluent contrast medium concentrating foci in the region of the head of the caudate nucleus and the right internal capsule. Because toxoplasmosis encephalitis was suspected, treatment was started with sulfadiazine (1 g four times daily), pyrimethamine (25 mg four times daily), folic acid (15 mg daily) and dexamethasone (8 mg three times daily). After 19 days of treatment there was no clinical improvement, and a check CT scan showed worsening with increased oedema of the cerebellar medulla, compression of the lateral ventricles and a mid-line shift of 5 mm. Since the Sabin-Feldman test titre had increased, and there was no evidence to suggest a lymphoma or a viral or fungal infection, toxoplasmosis resistant to standard therapy was postulated, and treatment was started with clindamycin (600 mg three times daily) and pyrimethamine (25 mg four times daily). The clinical features subsided within 4 days. A further check CT scan 14 days later showed almost complete resolution.
