A total of 240 Salmonella strains, 158 from 730 fish samples and 82 from 276 crustacean samples, obtained during a 2 year period, were examined for resistance to 10 antibiotics. More than 90% of the strains were resistant to bacitracin, penicillin and novobiocin. The least resistance was observed to chloramphenicol (6.7%) and nalidixic acid (12%). Multiple antibiotic resistance indexing of the strains showed that more than 95% originated from high risk sources of contamination such as poultry, swine, cattle and human environments where antibiotics are often used.
