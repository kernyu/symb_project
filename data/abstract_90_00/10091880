SETTING: Greater Mymensingh District, a rural area of Bangladesh, at the start of the National Tuberculosis Programme (NTP). OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence of initial and acquired drug resistance of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and to assess the appropriateness of the NTP's standard regimens. DESIGN: Sampling of pre-treatment sputum from all newly registered smear-positive cases in five centres covering the area. Culture and susceptibility testing in a supra-national reference laboratory. RESULTS: Initial resistance to isoniazid (H) was 5.4%, and to rifampicin (R) 0.5%. Acquired H and R resistance were 25.9% and 7.4%, respectively. Multidrug resistance (MDR) was observed in one new case only and in 5.6% of previously treated patients. Changing the present NTP indication for retreatment regimen to one month of previous H intake would increase coverage of H-resistant cases from 52% to 89%, adding 6% to drug costs. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of drug resistance is surprisingly low in Bangladesh, but could rise with improving economic conditions. The NTP regimens for smear-positive cases are appropriate, all the more so since the human immunodeficiency virus is virtually absent. Indications for the retreatment regimen should be extended to include all patients treated for at least one month with any drug. The NTP regimen for smear-negative cases runs the risk of leading to MDR under present field conditions.
