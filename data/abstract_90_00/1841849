An asporogenous spontaneous mutant of Streptomyces aureofaciens named ASR1 was selected on streptomycin gradient plates. The mutant is very stable and differs in ultrastructure and morphology, it is prototrophic but it lost the ability to grow well on soybean extract medium and produces one-tenth tetracyclines of the parent. The ASR1 mutant has a 3-4-fold increased resistance to streptomycin and is cross-resistant to other aminoglycosides. Comparison of the protein profiles from both strains on SDS gels revealed a very low expression of a 29.5 kDa protein in the ASR1 mutant which is overexpressed in both vegetative cells and spores of the parental strain.
