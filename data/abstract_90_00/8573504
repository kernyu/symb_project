Campylobacter gracilis (formerly Bacteroides gracilis) is an asaccharolytic, nitrate-positive, urease-negative organism that requires formate and fumarate or hydrogen as a growth additive and may pit agar media. Clinical isolates that were obtained primarily from appendiceal and peritoneal fluid specimens and initially were identified in our laboratory as B. gracilis were later found to include "unusual" strains that could be distinguished by biochemical and genetic criteria. These unusual C. gracilis strains were bile resistant, could not reduce tetrazolium chloride under aerobic conditions if formate and fumarate were added to the medium, and could grow in the presence of 2 or 6% oxygen if no blood was added to the medium. C. gracilis, other campylobacters, and the unusual strains produced distinctive dehydrogenase patterns when gels were incubated anaerobically. A cellular fatty acid analysis revealed that the cluster formed by the unusual organisms was distinct from the (separate) clusters formed by C. gracilis, Bacteroides ureolyticus, and other Campylobacter species. 16S rRNA sequence data indicated that these organisms are not related phylogenetically to either C. gracilis or other Campylobacter species; the most closely related taxa as determined by rRNA sequence analysis were unrelated aerobes (members of the genera Bordetella, Alcaligenes, Rhodocyclus, and Comamonas). DNA homology data confirmed that these taxa are separate groups. Our data indicate that the unusual organisms are members of a new genus and new species, for which we propose the name Sutterella wadsworthensis. The type strain of S. wadsworthensis is strain WAL 9799 (= ATCC 51579).
