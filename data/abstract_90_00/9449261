The effects of mutations in host genes on tetracycline resistance mediated by the Tet(O) and Tet(M) ribosomal protection proteins, which originated in Campylobacter spp. and Streptococcus spp., respectively, were investigated by using mutants of Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli. The miaA, miaB, and miaAB double mutants of S. typhimurium specify enzymes for tRNA modification at the adenosine at position 37, adjacent to the anticodon in tRNA. In S. typhimurium, this involves biosynthesis of N6-(4-hydroxyisopentenyl)-2-methylthio-adenosine (ms2io6A). The miaA mutation reduced the level of tetracycline resistance mediated by both Tet(O) and Tet(M), but the latter showed a greater effect, which was ascribed to the isopentenyl (i6) group or to a combination of the methylthioadenosine (ms2) and i6 groups but not to the ms2 group alone (specified by miaB). In addition, mutations in E. coli rpsL genes, generating both streptomycin-resistant and streptomycin-dependent strains, were also shown to reduce the level of tetracycline resistance mediated by Tet(O) and Tet(M). The single-site amino acid substitutions present in the rpsL mutations were pleiotropic in their effects on tetracycline MICs. These mutants affect translational accuracy and kinetics and suggest that Tet(O) and Tet(M) binding to the ribosome may be reduced or slowed in the E. coli rpsL mutants in which the S12 protein is altered. Data from both the miaA and rpsL mutant studies indicate a possible link between stability of the aminoacyl-tRNA in the ribosomal acceptor site and tetracycline resistance mediated by the ribosomal protection proteins.
