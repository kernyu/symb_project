We have previously shown that murine interferon gamma (IFN gamma) and its C-terminal peptide, muIFN gamma (95-133), bind to a region on the cytoplasmic domain of the IFN gamma receptor contained in the synthetic peptide, MIR(253-287). This region of the murine receptor bears considerable homology (approximately 80%) to its human counterpart. Here we report that not only do human IFN gamma and the human IFN gamma C-terminal peptide, huIFN gamma(95-134), bind to the cytoplasmic domain of the human IFN gamma receptor, but also that this interaction is species non-specific. MuIFN gamma(95-133) binds to human IFN gamma receptor cytoplasmic peptide HIR(252-291), and huIFN gamma(95-133) binds to MIR(253-287). Furthermore, treatment of murine macrophage cell lines with C-terminal peptides of either murine or human IFN gamma results in 10-fold upregulation of MHC class II molecule expression and increased resistance to infection with vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) (10(6)-10(9)-fold reduction in yield). These data suggest a direct role for the C-terminus of IFN gamma in the initiation of intracellular signalling processes and may be indicative of a more general mechanism of action for extracellular signalling molecules.
