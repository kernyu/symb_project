There has been an increasing multiple drug resistance problem in Vibrio cholerae biotype Eltor, the causative agent of 7th pandemic. The aim of this study was to show in vitro and in vivo susceptibility and effectiveness of quinolones in the treatment of endemic cholera cases. Excellent results were obtained in 53 bacteriologically confirmed cholera patients treated with short-term ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin. To our knowledge, there has been no previous report on this subject in the international medical literature. Our results show that quinolones can be an alternative drug for the treatment of multiply resistant V. cholerae infections.
