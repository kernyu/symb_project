Two episodes of meningitis due to penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae occurring in two patients with chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) are reported. Both patients were treated with ceftazidime. The first patient died, unresponsive to therapy. The second patient showed clinical improvement, reverting to her baseline mental status. This report draws attention to the fact that in chronic GVHD patients: (1) bacterial prophylaxis does not ensure protection against encapsulated bacteria; (2) rapid microbiological investigation is recommended with any upper respiratory tract infections.
