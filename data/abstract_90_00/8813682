The enzymes of the arginine dihydrolase pathway were measured in Trichomonas vaginalis hydrogenosome-deficient lines MR-5 and MR-100, and the parent strain TV 10-02. The activities and substrate affinities of arginine deiminase, carbamate kinase and ornithine decarboxylase were similar for the hydrogenosome-deficient lines and the parent TV 10-02. The activity of catabolic ornithine carbamyltransferase, however, was found to be 5-7-fold elevated in the hydrogenosome-deficient lines; the apparent K(m) for citrulline was similar for all of the lines. Putrescine biosynthesis by the hydrogenosome-deficient cell lines was found to be significantly higher than the parent. Incubation of strain MR-100 with U-[14C]-arginine resulted in a 5-fold greater amount of 14CO2 liberated compared to the parent strain TV 10-02. Inclusion of the ornithine decarboxylase inhibitor difluoromethylornithine in these incubations reduced the CO2 production of strain TV 10-02 by 42%, but only inhibited the MR-100 strain by 14.5%, indicative that the majority of the CO2 liberated from arginine by this strain is derived from the elevated activity of ornithine carbamyltransferase. Despite the increased flow through the arginine dihydrolase pathway, the energy gain to the parasite is approximately 10% of that from glucose, thus, under the growth conditions used in this study carbohydrate metabolism provides the bulk of the ATP for the parasite.
