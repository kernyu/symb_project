beta-Lactam antibiotics are produced by prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. The genes for beta-lactam biosynthesis are organized in clusters but the location of the different genes is not identical. Biosynthesis genes are clustered with genes for resistance (bla, pbp) and for the efflux of the antibiotic (cmcT) in prokaryotes. Comparison of proteins reveals much larger differences for primary metabolism enzymes than for beta-lactam biosynthesis enzymes in producing organisms. This suggests a horizontal transfer of the beta-lactam antibiotic biosynthesis genes.
