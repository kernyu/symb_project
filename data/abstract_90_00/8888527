Forty-nine sheep artificially exposed to a thiabendazole (TBZ) resistant isolate of Haemonchus contortus were assigned to 7 groups of 7 animals each and used to conduct a controlled anthelmintic trial. One group of sheep served as untreated infected controls and 6 groups were treated as follows: closantel, 5.0 mg kg-1; ivermectin, 0.2 mg kg-1; oxfendazole, 5.0 mg kg-1; thiophanate, 50 mg kg-1, levamisole, 7.5 mgkg-1 and thiabendazole, 66 mg kg-1. Eggs per gram of faeces were determined on days 21, 24 and day 34 (10 days post-treatment) after infection and all animals were necropsied for residual worm counts. The calculated efficacies of the treatments against H. contortus as indicated by worm reduction were closantel (100%), ivermectin (99.3%), oxfendazole (35.2%), thiophanate (56.7%), levamisole (98.6%) and thiabendazole (24.3%). The data therefore indicate that the TBZ-resistant isolate of H. contortus used was highly resistant to the 2 benzimidazole (BZ) anthelmintics, oxfendazole and thiophanate. This is the first report in Kenya of a field strain of H. contortus resistant to thiophanate.
