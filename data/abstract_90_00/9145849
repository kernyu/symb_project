Sixty isolates of Enterobacteriaceae resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics were collected over a period of 2 years in Switzerland and screened by hybridization for the carriage of SHV genes. Thirty-four positive strains were found, and their SHV genes were amplified and sequenced. SHV extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) were found: 13 strains contained SHV-2a, 12 harbored SHV-2, and SHV-5 was found twice. Four strains were shown to contain SHV-1. In addition, we report two new SHV variants, termed SHV-11 (non-ESBL) and SHV-12 (ESBL). In spite of the carriage of SHV ESBLs, many strains showed only low resistance to one or more third-generation cephalosporins. In addition, 26 did not transfer the blaSHV gene in mating experiments.
