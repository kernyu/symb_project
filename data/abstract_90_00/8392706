A new class of oligodeoxyribonucleotides has been designed, referred to here as 'self-stabilized' oligonucleotides. These oligonucleotides have hairpin loop structures at their 3' ends, and show increased resistance to degradation by snake venom phosphodiesterase, DNA polymerase I and fetal bovine serum. The self-stabilized region of the oligonucleotide does not interfere in hybridization with complementary nucleic acids as shown by melting temperature, mobility-shift and RNase H cleavage studies. Various self-stabilized oligonucleotides containing increasingly stable hairpin loop regions were studied for their anti-HIV activity. Pharmacokinetic and stability studies in mice showed increased in vivo persistence of self-stabilized oligonucleotides with respect to their linear counterparts.
