Cefotaxime is a third-generation cephalosporin with excellent in vitro antimicrobial activity against Neisseria gonorrhoeae, including beta-lactamase-producing strains. A single 1-g intramuscular dose is suitable for the treatment of uncomplicated gonorrhea. We conducted an open, randomized study to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and cost impact of a lower dose (500 mg) of cefotaxime versus 250 mg ceftriaxone, an often recommended treatment for uncomplicated gonorrhea. Of the 222 patients enrolled, the cases of 151 were fully assessable. Bacteriologic elimination rates were 99% in the cefotaxime group and 100% in the ceftriaxone group. Clinical response rates were 78% and 83% in the two groups, respectively. Adverse clinical events occurred in 4% and 9% of patients in the two groups, respectively. The average wholesale price of 500 mg cefotaxime is 31% lower than that of 250 mg ceftriaxone. A 500-mg dose of cefotaxime appears to be a safe and cost-effective alternative to 250 mg ceftriaxone for the treatment of uncomplicated gonorrhea.
