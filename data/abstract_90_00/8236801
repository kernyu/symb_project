Phagocytosis and intracellular survival of Brucella abortus, and oxidant production by monocyte-derived macrophages from ten B. abortus-naive cows were studied. Phagocytosis of bacteria opsonized with naive-autologous sera or reactor serum was significantly less than phagocytosis of bacteria opsonized with fetal bovine serum. After phagocytosis, intracellular survival of bacteria opsonized with naive-autologous or reactor sera was significantly less than survival of bacteria opsonized with fetal bovine serum. Production of oxidant by macrophages stimulated with B. abortus opsonized with naive-autologous, reactor, or fetal bovine sera was not significantly different. Although macrophages from one animal showed significantly less phagocytic activity, intracellular killing and oxidant production by macrophages from the ten individual cows toward B. abortus opsonized with naive-autologous, reactor, and fetal calf sera were homogeneous. The abilities of the macrophages to phagocytize and to kill B. abortus were not associated with each other or with oxidant production. Innate resistance or sensitivity to B. abortus was not identified in the cows based on macrophage function.
