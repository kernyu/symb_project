Genetic mapping of 2 mutations designated as rif5 and rif8 determining different levels of rifampicin resistance in Saccharopolyspora erythraea, an organism producing erythromycin, was performed. The mutations were inherited as chromosomal markers and localized in the same region of the chromosome restricted by ura1 and met1 loci. No close linking of rif5 and rif8 with any of the auxotrophic property markers in S. erythraea was detected. There were observed differences in the indices of correlation between the inheritance of rif8, rif5 and the chromosomal markers between which they were located. The data indicated that mutations rif5 and rif8 probably occurred in different genes.
