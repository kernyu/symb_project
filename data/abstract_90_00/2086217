Between 40 and 43 Haemophilus influenzae isolates obtained from Greece, Lebanon, Israel and Morocco respectively (a total of 167 strains) were analysed for prevalence of resistance to six different drugs. Of these isolates 12.6% produced beta-lactamase and were resistant to ampicillin. All isolates, except a single strain from Greece, were susceptible to cefaclor. The frequency of resistance to chloramphenicol and tetracycline was below 2%. The frequency of isolates susceptible and resistant to erythromycin and cotrimoxazole varied from country to country.
