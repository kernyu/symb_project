Upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs), particularly otitis media and sinusitis, are prevalent among children. With recurrent URTIs there is an increased likelihood of sequelae. Suppurative complications associated with URTIs, although rare, must be treated rapidly to prevent serious morbidity and mortality. Further, increase in antimicrobial resistance may be accompanied by an increased risk for complications because infecting pathogens may be more difficult to eradicate.
