We compared the in vitro activity of broad spectrum beta-lactam antibiotics against 573 gram-negative isolates (enterobacteriaceae and non-fermenters) collected between November 1996 and May 1997 from 9 laboratories serving intensive care units throughout Austria. MIC's (Minimal Inhibitory Concentration) were obtained with the E-test for meropenem, imipenem, ceftazidime, cefepime, cefpirome and piperacillin/tazobactam. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most frequently isolated organism (22%), followed by E. coli (19%), Klebsiella spp. (16%), and Enterobacter spp. (14%). Acinetobacter spp., Proteus spp., Serratia spp., Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Citrobacter spp., Morganella morganii, Burkholderia cepacia and Salmonella enteritidis were isolated less frequently. Overall meropenem, imipenem and ceftazidime were the most active compounds in vitro, inhibiting 90%, 89%, and 87% of the isolates, respectively. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was inhibited by piperacillin/tazobactam in 89%, by cefepime in 87% and by ceftazidime in 85%. Imipenem, meropenem and cefpirome were less active (79%, 75% and 69% respectively). All E. coli strains were inhibited by meropenem, 99% were inhibited by imipenem, cefepime and cefpirome. Ceftazidime was active against 95% and piperacillin/tazobactam against 92% of E. coli. All Klebsiella spp. were inhibited by meropenem, cefepime and cefpirome. Imipenem inhibited 99% and ceftazidime 98% of the Klebsiella isolates. Piperacillin/tazobactam was active against 95% of Klebsiella spp. In vitro carbapenems are still the most active of all antibiotics tested. The relatively high resistance of Pseudomonas spp. and Acinetobacter spp. to carbapenems reflects the wide use of carbapenems during the last years. However, most bacterial isolates are still sensitive to the tested broad spectrum beta-lactams.
