A laboratory pneumococcal strain resistant to cefotaxime was studied by DNA-induced transformation in order to characterize its genetic structure. At least three independent genes were required to confer the highest level of resistance to this beta-lactam antibiotic. The accumulation of mutations in these three genes accounted for three levels of resistance. Mutation of the gene encoding penicillin-binding protein 2x was very likely responsible for the first step of resistance, which was a prerequisite for sequential increase in resistance. Additionally, strains highly resistant to cefotaxime were defective for natural transformation. Revertants of these strains were frequently observed. Such strains had recovered full transformability, suggesting a correlation between the inability to be transformed and a high level of resistance to cefotaxime. The possibility of electrotransforming these highly resistant strains suggests that natural transformation is probably blocked at the DNA-uptake level.
