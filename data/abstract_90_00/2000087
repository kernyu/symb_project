A transformation system for Ophiostoma ulmi (Buism.) Nannf. was developed and analyzed. Protoplasts were generated from actively budding yeastlike cells by digestion with NovoZym 234 in MgSO4 after pretreatment with 2-mercaptoethanol. Protoplast regeneration was most efficient when 0.6 M sucrose was used as the osmoticum. Several plasmids containing fusions between fungal promoters and a bacterial gene for hygromycin phosphotransferase successfully transformed O. ulmi to hygromycin resistance. One of these vectors, pPS57, which contains a promoter for isopenicillin N synthetase from Penicillium chrysogenum, consistently conferred the greatest resistance to hygromycin. Linearization of the vector and inclusion of 2-mercaptoethanol in the transformation reaction resulted in enhanced transformation efficiency. Approximately 4 x 10(3) transformants/micrograms DNA per 10(7) protoplasts were obtained using the optimized procedure. Southern hybridization after alternating field and standard electrophoresis suggested random insertion of tandem repeats (some greater than 250 kb) into the fungal chromosomes. Antibiotic resistance was stable through mitosis. However, expression of the transforming DNA after meiosis was highly variable.
