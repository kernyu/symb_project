BACKGROUND: There is little evidence supporting the efficacy of prophylactic antibiotics in preventing secondary cases of bacterial meningitis, and recent guidance extended the use of prophylactic antibiotics amongst children who attend pre-school groups. METHODS: We examined the volume of rifampicin prescribed, and that recommended to contacts of cases of meningococcal and Hib meningitis in Somerset over a three-year period using case note records of the Consultant for Communicable Disease Control (CCDC) and PACT data. RESULTS: There was evidence of excessive prescribing over and above that recommended by the CCDC. CONCLUSIONS: Excessive prescribing increases the chance of serious drug side effects and the development of antibiotic resistance. It is suggested that both meningitis contacts and information about early symptoms of meningitis, as well as an explanation of the rationale behind the prescribing of antibiotic prophylaxis to contacts. This may reduce the likelihood of unnecessary prescribing and subsequent complications.
