OBJECTIVE: To establish the prevalence of nosocomial bacterial infection and changes in resistance in a comprehensive intensive care unit. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed all the bacterial isolates of ICU, PUMC Hospital from 1989 to 1994, such as the species and resistance pattern. RESULTS: Among all bacterial isolates, the percentage of Gram-positive cocci steadily increased (16% in 1989, 33% in 1994), while that of Gram-negative bacilli decreased (84% in 1989, 67% in 1994). The most prevalent isolates of Gram-negative pathogens were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumanii, inducible Enterobacteriaceae and Xanthomonas maltophilia, with imipenem and amikacin as the most susceptible antibiotics. Enterococci, oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis and oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus accounted for 44%, 21% and 10%, respectively. The resistant rate of these three Gram-positive bacteria to vancomycin were 19%, 0% and 0%. CONCLUSION: Understanding of the epidemiological data and changes of bacterial resistance profile is prerequisite to rational use of antibiotics, which is crucial to reducing the resistance of nosocomial infection pathogens.
