The incidence of invasive infections with Candida has strongly increased during the last few decades. Candida is now one of the commonest hospital pathogens. Many infections are nowadays caused by other species than C. albicans, notably C. tropicalis, C. krusei and C. glabrata. Particularly in HIV seropositive patients the yeast may develop resistance to fungistatic drugs. The altered species frequency and the resistance appear to be caused by the use of fungistatic agents of the imidazole group. To counter these developments the choice of antifungal therapeutics should be made very carefully.
