A total of 51 potential pathogenic vibrios were isolated from moribund silver seabream Sparus sarba, which were collected from local fish farms of Hong Kong. All the isolates were classified and identified as 7 species by the API 20 E system and the scheme of Alsina & Blanch. These species were Vibrio alginolyticus (24 strains), Vibrio vulnificus (12 strains), Vibrio parahaemolyticus(7 strains), Vibrio logei(4 strains), Vibrio pelagius II(2 strains), Vibrio fluvialis (1 strains) and Vibrio meditterranei (1 strains). Among these isolates, the three predominant species (V. alginolyticus, V. vulnificus and V. parahaemolyticus) were confirmed to be virulent to sea bream by experimental challenge. All isolates were also screened for plasmid DNA by agarose gel electrophoresis and tested for susceptibility to 16 antimicrobial agents by the agar dilution method. Of the 51 isolates examined, all strains were sensitive to ceftriaxone, streptomycin, nalidixic acid and rifampicin, and almost all were sensitive to ceftazidime, netilimicin, chloramphenicol and sulfamethoxazole except one or two strains. Most isolates were resistant to ampicillin (60. 8%), cefuroxime (66.7%), amikacin(55%), kanamycin(58.8%) and trimethoprinm (76.5%). Fifteen of the 51 isolates harboured 1-4 plasmids, with sizes ranging from 9 to 123 kb. Both the plasmids and the associated antimicrobial resistance (ampicillin, cefuroxime and trimethoprim) of 9 isolates could be transferred to recipient by single-step conjugation, however, the frequencies were very low, ranging from 10(-11) to 10(-9). The present results indicate that resistance to these antibiotics is chromosomal.
