To gather information on the antibiotic susceptibility of Shigella and Salmonella in the Baltic countries, 98 Shigella and 100 Salmonella isolates collected consecutively in 1994 were examined. All Shigella isolates were resistant to at least two of 12 antibacterial agents: 100% were resistant to oxytetracycline, 92% to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, 64% to chloramphenicol, and 64% to ampicillin. Five different resistance patterns were observed.
