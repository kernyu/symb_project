The bacteria causing diseases that are now becoming serious public health threats are neither strange nor exotic, but rather shockingly familiar. Tuberculosis, typhoid fever, meningitis, pneumonia, and septicemias are emerging global threats. The infectious agents causing these serious threats are the same bacteria identified many decades ago. The only difference is that these and other microorganisms are no longer killed by the "miracle drugs" that have kept them at bay for the past six decades. Antibiotic resistance has made potential killers out of bacteria that previously posed little threat to mankind. The indiscriminate and reckless use of antibiotics has led to a fast-approaching crisis in which human dominance of the planet is threatened by single, elementary cells of the microbial world. Part I of this article detailed the causes of the crisis. Part II addresses the solutions that are recommended by national and international authorities and organizations.
