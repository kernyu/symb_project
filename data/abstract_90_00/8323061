Critical tests were conducted in horses (n = 11) with naturally acquired infections of benzimidazole (BZ)-resistant population-B small strongyles in 1989 and 1990. Anthelmintics administered were thiabendazole (44 mg/kg of body weight, n = 4), oxibendazole (10 mg/kg, n = 3), and oxfendazole (OFZ, 10 mg/kg; n = 4). All compounds were paste formulations administered orally except for 1 of the OFZ treatments, which was a suspension formulation given by stomach tube. Aggregate mean efficacy was calculated for all species of small strongyles, drug-resistant and non-resistant. The highest efficacy was for oxibendazole (98%) and OFZ (94%); efficacy for thiabendazole was 63%. Five genera and 16 species of small strongyles were recovered from the 11 horses, ranging from 7 to 13 species (mean, 11). Of these, 7 species were found to have resistance in variable degrees to most of the anthelmintics. These strongyles were Cyathostomum catinatum, Cyathostomum coronatum, Cylicocyclus nassatus, Cylicostephanus calicatus, Cylicostephanus goldi, Cylicostephanus longibursatus, and Cylicostephanus minutus. The large strongyle, Strongylus vulgaris, was present in all 11 test horses, and efficacy was 100% for all drugs. Seven of the BZ-treated foals (at least 1 horse from each BZ-treatment group), were infected with S edentatus; removal was 100%.
