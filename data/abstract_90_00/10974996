Isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis from 120 tuberculosis patients seen in the 12 months ending September 1994 at 2 tertiary-care centres in Rio de Janeiro were characterized by IS6110 restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis. Ninety-seven patients (81%) had isolates with unique RFLP patterns, while 23 patients (19%) had isolates that belonged to 11 different RFLP cluster patterns. The strains from the latter patients were distributed among 1 group of 3 patients and 10 groups of 2 patients each. The cluster-pattern strains were not associated with gender, age, HIV infection, type of residence, living in shelter, homelessness or previous history of tuberculosis. However, clustering was strongly associated with multidrug resistance (P = 0.006). These data suggest that recent exogenous transmission may be important for the development of new cases of multidrug-resistant disease in patients attending tertiary-care centres in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
