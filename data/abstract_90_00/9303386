To evaluate whether increased doses of amoxicillin should be used to treat acute pneumococcal otitis media, an in vitro pharmacokinetic model was used to evaluate the killing of pneumococci by amoxicillin when middle ear pharmacokinetics were simulated. Logarithmic-phase cultures were exposed to peak concentrations of 3, 6, and 9 microg of amoxicillin per ml every 12 h, and an elimination half-life of 1.6 h was simulated. Changes in viable bacterial counts were measured over 36 h. All three doses rapidly decreased the viable bacterial counts of penicillin-susceptible strains below the 10-CFU/ml limit of detection by 6 to 10 h and maintained counts below this limit through 36 h. The 3-microg/ml peak dose was much less effective against two of three strains with intermediate penicillin resistance and all three penicillin-resistant strains, with bacterial counts approaching those in drug-free control cultures by 12 h. The 6-microg/ml peak dose completely eliminated two of three strains with intermediate penicillin resistance and maintained viable counts of the other nonsusceptible strains at 1.5 to 2 logs below the initial inoculum through 36 h. The 9-microg/ml peak dose was most effective, completely eliminating all three strains with intermediate penicillin resistance and maintaining the viable counts of the resistant strains at 3 to 4 logs below the original inoculum. The pharmacodynamics observed in this study suggest that peak concentrations of amoxicillin of 6 to 9 microg/ml may be sufficient for the elimination of penicillin-nonsusceptible pneumococcal strains causing otitis media, especially those with intermediate resistance to amoxicillin. In vivo pharmacokinetic studies are needed to determine if these levels can be achieved in middle ear fluid with amoxicillin at 70 to 90 mg/kg/day divided into two daily doses. If these levels are reliably achieved, then clinical studies are warranted.
