Human MDR1 cDNA was introduced into the human cultured cells KB-3-1 and Schizosaccharomyces pombe pmd1 null mutant KN3. The drug sensitivity of KB-G2 and KN3/pgp, expressing human P-glycoprotein, was examined. KB-G2 was resistant to the peptide antibiotics valinomycin and gramicidin D as well as having a typical multidrug resistance (MDR) phenotype. KN3/pgp was resistant to valinomycin and actinomycin D, but not to adriamycin. The ATP-hydrolysis-deficient mutant did not confer KN3 resistance to these antibiotics. Human P-glycoprotein expressed in S. pombe seemed to lack N-glycosylation. The N-glycosylation-deficient mutant, however, conferred a typical MDR phenotype on KB-3-1. These results suggest that human P-glycoprotein functions as an efflux pump of valinomycin and actinomycin D in the membrane of S. pombe.
