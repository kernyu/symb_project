Dr. Anthony Fauci of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases spoke in Durban about possible strategies to reduce the total amount of antiretroviral drugs needed; he mentioned that five patients are now being treated every other week in a small trial. It is important to understand that these patients had their viral load very well under control before starting this trial, so that their virus remained essentially undetectable during the week off the drugs; therefore, there was little or no virus present to develop resistance. This strategy would be much more risky for others.
