The in vitro activity of daptomycin against 297 clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis sensu strictu was compared with the activities of cephalothin, dicloxacillin, tobramycin, and vancomycin. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined by an agar dilution method. Cephalothin and dicloxacillin showed the highest activity against S. aureus on a weight-for-weight basis, all isolates being inhibited by 0.5 mg/l or less of either agent. Cephalothin was somewhat more active against S. epidermidis than was dicloxacillin. Daptomycin and vancomycin exhibited high and similar activity against both S. aureus and S. epidermidis (MIC90% = 1 and 2 mg/l, respectively). Tobramycin was highly active against S. aureus, but the activity against S. epidermidis was greatly variable (MIC range less than or equal to 0.03 - greater than or equal to 16 mg/l). The activity of daptomycin was markedly influenced by the test medium; the MICs were generally 32 times higher when the isolates were tested on Iso-Sensitest agar than on Mueller-Hinton agar. Supplementation of Iso-Sensitest agar with increasing concentrations of calcium potentiated the activity of daptomycin substantially, the results obtained on Iso-Sensitest agar supplemented with 20 mg Ca2+/l being similar to those obtained on Mueller-Hinton agar.
