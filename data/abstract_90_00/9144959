Thionins are antimicrobial proteins that are thought to be involved in plant defense. Concordant with this view, we have recently shown that the Arabidopsis thionin Thi2.1 gene is inducible by phytopathogenic fungi. Here, we demonstrate that constitutive overexpression of this thionin enhances the resistance of the susceptible ecotype Columbia (Col-2) against attack by Fusarium oxysporum f sp matthiolae. Transgenic lines had a reduced loss of chlorophyll after inoculation and supported significantly less fungal growth on the cotyledons, as evaluated by trypan blue staining. Moreover, fungi on cotyledons of transgenic lines had more hyphae with growth anomalies, including hyperbranching, than on cotyledons of the parental line. No transcripts for pathogenesis-related PR-1, PR-5, or the pathogen-inducible plant defensin Pdf1.2 could be detected in uninoculated transgenic seedlings, indicating that all of the observed effects of the overexpressing lines are most likely the result of the toxicity of the THI2.1 thionin. Our findings strongly support the view that thionins are defense proteins.
