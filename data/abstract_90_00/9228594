One of the health education messages given in sexually transmitted disease (STD) control is patients' adopting appropriate health seeking behaviour. This includes reporting to health facilities for appropriate diagnosis and treatment. In parts of the world where STD aetiologic agents have assumed resistance to commonly used antimicrobials, this is important. The antimicrobial self medication practices of 764 patients attending an STD clinic in a developing country were studied. Seventy-four and a half per cent admitted to self medication before reporting to the clinic. The antibiotics taken in inappropriate dosages were purchased over the counter, given by friends or were 'left-overs' from previous medications. In the fight to control STD spread as a means of reducing the incidence of HIV/AIDS, indiscriminate use of antimicrobials needs to be guarded against.
