Gram-negative bacterial pneumonia is the leading cause of fatal nosocomial infection in this country. Predisposing factors include altered upper respiratory tract flora and altered barriers that normally protect the sterile lower respiratory tract from invasion by pharyngeal bacteria. Aztreonam, which is highly active against most gram-negative pathogens and which does not cause nephrotoxicity, has been evaluated in the treatment of nosocomial pneumonia. In vitro and pharmacokinetic data on aztreonam indicate that this agent provides an alternative agent for use when resistance to cephalosporin and aminoglycoside antibiotics has developed. Data further suggest that aztreonam may interact synergistically with aminoglycosides against gram-negative pathogens. Clinical study supports the usefulness of aztreonam against gram-negative nosocomial pneumonia. Since aztreonam is inactive against gram-positive and anaerobic bacteria, it must be used in combination with other antibiotics when these pathogens are suspected.
