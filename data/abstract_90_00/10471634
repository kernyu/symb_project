Idiopathic neonatal eosinophilic pneumonia is extremely rare. We report an infant who presented with tachypnea and interstitial infiltrates on chest radiograph at age 2 wk. Lung biopsy revealed perivascular and interstitial eosinophils. Despite initial improvement, the patient's condition became resistant to corticosteroids, cromolyn, and intravenous gamma globulin. After treatment with cyclosporin A his symptoms resolved.
