A Hut-78 cell clone (F12) harboring a nonproducer human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) variant shows complete resistance to HIV-1 or HIV-2 superinfection. The F12-HIV provirus produces an altered HIV-1 protein pattern and cannot generate even immature viral particles. We demonstrated that HeLa CD4+ cells transfected with the F12-HIV genome resist HIV superinfection through a CD4-independent mechanism. As F12-HIV appears to be a useful system to induce anti-HIV intracellular immunization, we constructed various retroviral vectors containing the F12-HIV genome, modified by elimination of the F12 3'LTR and part of its nef gene, inserted 'antisense' with respect to the Moloney murine leukemia virus 5' LTR. Here we show that recombinant retroviral particles carrying the N2/F12-HIV nef- (as) construct can stably transduce both CEMss human cells and primary human peripheral blood lymphocytes, inducing the expression of the F12-HIV genome. These results could open the way to an anti-AIDS gene therapy strategy based on F12-HIV-induced intracellular immunization.
