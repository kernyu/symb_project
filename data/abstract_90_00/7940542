The effects of various glycolytic substrates and keto acid metabolites on the cytotoxic effects of cyanide have been studied with isolated rat hepatocytes. The sequence of cytotoxic events with 2 mM cyanide was an immediate inhibition of respiration followed by ATP depletion. Disruption of the plasma membrane occurred when 85-90% of ATP levels had been depleted. Fructose, dihydroxyacetone, glyceraldehyde, pyruvate, and alpha-ketoglutarate prevented cyanide-induced cytotoxicity and ATP depletion. Hepatocyte respiration was also restored by all except fructose. Fructose, unlike the others, also did not prevent cytotoxicity if added 30-60 min after cyanide. Fluoride, an inhibitor of the glycolytic enzyme enolase, prevented protection by fructose but not dihydroxyacetone or glyceraldehyde, suggesting that dihydroxyacetone and glyceraldehyde are cytoprotective by trapping cyanide, thereby restoring cytochrome oxidase activity and cellular ATP levels. Fructose, on the other hand, may be cytoprotective by supplying ATP through glycolysis. Hepatocytes isolated from fasted rats were five- to sevenfold more susceptible to cyanide-induced cytotoxicity. Furthermore, all glycogenic and gluconeogenic amino acids and carbohydrates were cytoprotective against cyanide toxicity toward fasted hepatocytes, suggesting that cellular energy stores determine their resistance to cyanide.
