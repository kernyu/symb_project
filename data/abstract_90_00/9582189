High-density oligonucleotide arrays can be used to rapidly examine large amounts of DNA sequence in a high throughput manner. An array designed to determine the specific nucleotide sequence of 705 bp of the rpoB gene of Mycobacterium tuberculosis accurately detected rifampin resistance associated with mutations of 44 clinical isolates of M. tuberculosis. The nucleotide sequence diversity in 121 Mycobacterial isolates (comprised of 10 species) was examined by both conventional dideoxynucleotide sequencing of the rpoB and 16S genes and by analysis of the rpoB oligonucleotide array hybridization patterns. Species identification for each of the isolates was similar irrespective of whether 16S sequence, rpoB sequence, or the pattern of rpoB hybridization was used. However, for several species, the number of alleles in the 16S and rpoB gene sequences provided discordant estimates of the genetic diversity within a species. In addition to confirming the array's intended utility for sequencing the region of M. tuberculosis that confers rifampin resistance, this work demonstrates that this array can identify the species of nontuberculous Mycobacteria. This demonstrates the general point that DNA microarrays that sequence important genomic regions (such as drug resistance or pathogenicity islands) can simultaneously identify species and provide some insight into the organism's population structure.
