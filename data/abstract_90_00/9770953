Resistant enterococci, especially vancomycin-resistant enterococci, have rapidly become an important nosocomial pathogen. They are increasingly prevalent among hospitalized patients, patients with serious chronic illnesses, and immunosuppressed patients. Risk factors identified include previous antibiotics, exposure to contaminated equipment, and close proximity to infected patients. Treatment of multidrug-resistant pathogens has become increasingly difficult, with increased morbidity and mortality in these patients. Strict infection control measures remain the mainstay in the management of these infections.
