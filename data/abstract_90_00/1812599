The in vivo response of Plasmodium falciparum to chloroquine, amodiaquine, pyrimethamine-sulfalene (MetakelfinR) and pyrimethamine-sulfadoxine (FansidarR) was assessed in Dodoma in 1988. Asymptomatic schoolchildren with pure P. falciparum infection were given full curative doses of one of the above antimalarials. Daily parasitological follow-ups were made for seven days. Overall successful follow-up cases were 101, 108, 95 and 97 on chloroquine, amodiaquine, MetakelfinR and FansidarR respectively. The overall resistance rate in the area was 28%. Most of the resistant cases were RII type. There was only one case of MetakelfinR resistance. Amodiaquine and FansidarR were fully effective in eliminating asexual parasitaemia from the blood in all the cases during the seven days of follow-up. The results indicate that chloroquine, a commonly used antimalarial in Tanzania, is not as effective as amodiaquine, a less used drug. Although the 'antifols' are still highly effective in Tanzania, their potency could change with continued use. These drugs should, therefore, be protected and used judiciously.
