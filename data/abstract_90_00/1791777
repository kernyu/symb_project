Strains, producers of oleandomycin, with different level of antibiotic-formation have been studied for their resistance to their own antibiotic. The obtained highly active strain possesses double resistance to oleandomycin and 50% higher activity. Identity of oleandomycin phosphate substances synthesized by initial and produced highly active strains is shown by the HELC method.
