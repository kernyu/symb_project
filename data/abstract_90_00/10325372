The BBL Crystal MRSA ID test (Becton Dickinson) was applied directly to blood culture vials containing clusters of gram-positive cocci. The sensitivity and specificity of the test were 84 and 100% and 54 and 100% for vials containing Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci, respectively. This test is a reliable method for direct detection of methicillin resistance in positive blood culture vials when S. aureus is identified in parallel by rapid identification procedures.
