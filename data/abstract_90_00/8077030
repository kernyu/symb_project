Twenty-six neonates were diagnosed to have acinetobacter sepsis during 1986-90, representing 6.5% of all cases of bacteriologically proven sepsis. Of these 19 neonates were low birth weight (LBW) 12 were small for gestational age (SGA). Nineteen neonates had early-onset sepsis. The male to female ratio was 9:17. The hematological profile was suggestive of sepsis in 17 cases. All infants had clinical evidence of multi system infection. Eleven babies died; the cases-fatality rate was 42.3%. Only 15/25 culture isolates were sensitive to gentamicin and resistance to other antibiotics was even more frequent. Acinetobacter was cultured from other sites: eye swabs, skin pustules and umbilical catheter tips. Environmental nursery surveillance cultures done during the study period yielded Acinetobacter once from a crib, but no cases of sepsis occurred around that time. The epidemiological features of this organism illustrate the value of vigilance and precautionary measures.
