The incidence of infections caused by resistant Gram-positive pathogens is increasing, while emergence of vancomycin resistance is reducing the number of therapeutic options. New agents are being rapidly evaluated as candidates to replace vancomycin; some of the most promising include semisynthetic glycopeptides, quinupristin-dalfopristin, oxazolidinones and everninomycins. Alternative strategies, including immunization and therapeutic vaccines, may also have a role.
