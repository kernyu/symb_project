Drug selection for eradication therapy of H. pylori, considering their drug resistance was evaluated. The measurement of resistant colonies was performed in blood agar plates using the MIC method and the criteria for resistance was as follows: MIC > 1 mg/l with AMPC, MIC > 2 mg/l with CAM and MIC > 8 mg/l with MNZ. Primary resistant colonies were found in 0% with AMPC, 8.9% with CAM and 5.9% with MNZ. Secondary resistant colonies were found in 0% with AMPC, 50.0% with CAM and 54.5% with MNZ. CAM and MNZ showed high resistance rate and among them, colonies resistant to CAM were also highly resistant to MNZ. But colonies resistant to MNZ (acquired after CAM) were all sensitive to AMPC. Considering this issue and the absence of resistance to AMPC, we considered the triple therapy with AMPC, MNZ and a PPI as the best option for the eradication of H. pylori.
