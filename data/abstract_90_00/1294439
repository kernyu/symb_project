The authors report on a female patient of 26 years of age suffering from malaria tropica infection in her 36th week of pregnancy with fatal outcome. The newborn (after performance of Caesarean section) was infected connatally. Although infections with malaria are rare in Europe today--especially during pregnancy--there is a probability of rising incidence on account of increasing international tourism. Therapeutic problems are expected to multiply due to the resistance of Plasmodia to antiparasitary medication. Additionally pregnancy involves the risk of a more severe course of the disease in the mother. Pregnant women should be discouraged from travelling to countries with malarial risk because of the likelihood of a high rate of abortion, danger of intrauterine retardation, increased incidence of premature deliveries and risk of connatal infection of the newborn. If such warnings cannot be heeded, the persons concerned must be given all relevant information on conventional preventive measures in accordance with WHO recommendations and drug prophylaxis as recommended by a hospital or institution dealing with tropical diseases according to updated standards. The measures to be taken must be adapted to the individual risk of exposure of the patient.
