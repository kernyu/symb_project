BACKGROUND: After renal transplantation, patients have an up to 5% chance of being infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis and there are reports from western countries of a 24% mortality if the infection is drug resistant. We investigated primary drug resistance in renal transplant recipients in Vellore, Tamil Nadu. METHODS: Between January 1987 and December 1993 we studied 695 patients (who had received 717 renal allografts) for evidence of tuberculosis, and performed drug sensitivity tests. RESULTS: Forty-three patients had culture-proven infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis of whom 40 had drug sensitivity tests done. Initial drug resistance was seen from 1991. Rifampicin resistance was seen in 2, 1 and 4 patients and isoniazid resistance in 1, 2 and 2 patients in 1991, 1992 and 1993, respectively of the 23 isolates tested for drug susceptibility. Multi-drug resistance was seen in 1 and 2 patients in 1992 and 1993. CONCLUSIONS: This is probably the first report in India of primary drug resistance of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in renal allograft recipients. It is a cause for concern as it may indicate a large reservoir of drug-resistant patients in the community.
