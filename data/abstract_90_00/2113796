Neisseria gonorrhoeae strains resistant to treatment with penicillin, tetracycline, and/or spectinomycin are increasing in prevalence in many parts of the world. In Zambia, 52% of N. gonorrhoeae isolates produced beta-lactamase in 1986. Few oral regimens have proven effective for treatment of resistant N. gonorrhoeae. We conducted a prospective, double-blind, randomized clinical trial of 250 mg of ciprofloxacin given orally versus 250 mg of ceftriaxone given intramuscularly for treatment of uncomplicated gonococcal urethritis in adult males. Two hundred men were enrolled and treated. The two groups were comparable in age (27.5 years), prevalence of latent syphilis (14 and 10%), and human immunodeficiency virus infection (32 and 38%). Of 165 patients with cultures positive for N. gonorrhoeae who returned for follow-up, ciprofloxacin cured 83 of 83 (100%), including 26 with penicillinase-producing N. gonorrhoeae (PPNG) and 21 with N. gonorrhoeae with chromosomally mediated resistance to multiple antibiotics (CMRNG), and ceftriaxone cured 81 of 82 (98.7%), including 30 with PPNG and 19 with CMRNG. Both treatment regimens were well tolerated. Chlamydia trachomatis in urethral exudate was found by direct fluorescent-antibody microscopic examination or by culture in 10 (5%) participants. All N. gonorrhoeae isolates were inhibited by ceftriaxone at 0.06 micrograms/ml, except one which was inhibited at 0.125 micrograms/ml, while ciprofloxacin inhibited all isolates at 0.03 micrograms/ml. Ciprofloxacin is a safe and effective therapy for uncomplicated gonococcal urethritis, including that caused by PPNG and CMRNG in human immunodeficiency virus-infected men.
