The efficacy of furazolidone and chloramphenicol was compared in a randomized trial involving 133 children with bacteriologically confirmed typhoid fever. Sixty-five children were randomized to receive furazolidone, 7.5 mg/kg/day, and 68 children to receive chloramphenicol, 75 mg/kg/day. Both drugs were administered orally. The clinical characteristics of the two treatment groups were comparable on admission. All the strains of Salmonella typhi isolated from the furazolidone group were susceptible to furazolidone. However, of the 68 strains of S. typhi isolated from the chloramphenicol group, 10 were susceptible and 58 were resistant to chloramphenicol. Clinical and bacteriologic cure was observed in 56 (86.2%) children treated with furazolidone and in 35 (51.5%) children given chloramphenicol who were infected with S. typhi strains, irrespective of susceptibility pattern (P = 0.00003). Cure was achieved in 86.2% of furazolidone recipients and 90.0% of chloramphenicol recipients who were infected with strains of S. typhi susceptible to both drugs (P = 0.6). The difference in cure rate was statistically significant (P = 0.000003) when the two treatment groups infected with furazolidone-susceptible but chloramphenicol-resistant strains of S. typhi were compared. There was no relapse or carriers in either of the groups. Furazolidone appears to be a satisfactory alternative to chloramphenicol in the treatment of typhoid fever caused by chloramphenicol-resistant strains of S. typhi.
