Mupirocin resistance in Staphylococcus aureus results from changes in the target enzyme, isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase (IRS). Twelve strains of S. aureus comprising four susceptible (MICs < or = 4 micrograms/ml), four intermediate level-resistant (MICs between 8 and 256 micrograms/ml), and four highly resistant (MICs > or = 512 micrograms/ml) isolates were examined for their IRS content and the presence of a gene known to encode high-level mupirocin resistance. Ion-exchange chromatography of cell extracts showed a single IRS active peak in mupirocin-susceptible strains, with 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50s) of 0.7 to 3.0 ng of mupirocin per ml. In strains showing intermediate mupirocin resistance, similar single IRS activity peaks were observed, but these were less sensitive to inhibition, and the mupirocin IC50s for them were 19 to 43 ng/ml. Strains that were highly resistant to mupirocin displayed two distinct peaks; one was similar to that found with susceptible strains (IC50, 0.9 to 2.5 ng/ml), but an additional peak with an IC50 of 7,000 to 10,000 ng/ml was also observed. A strain cured of the plasmid encoding high-level mupirocin resistance lacked the resistant IRS peak. Restriction digests, produced by endonuclease NcoI, of total bacterial DNA isolated from the highly resistant strains hybridized with a mupirocin resistance gene probe, whereas DNA isolated from the intermediate level-resistant and susceptible strains did not. These results demonstrate that two different IRS enzymes were present in highly mupirocin-resistant S. aureus strains. In strains expressing intermediate levels of resistance, only a chromosomally encoded IRS which was inhibited less by mupirocin than IRS from fully susceptible strains was detected.
