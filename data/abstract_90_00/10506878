UNLABELLED: ALTERNATIVE TO BETA-LACTAMS: Due to the rapid and increasing development of resistance in the two main bacteria, S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae, it is important to determine whether pristinamycin, with known efficacy against these germs, could be a useful alternative to beta-lactams for the treatment of adult acute community-acquired pneumonia. PRISTINAMYCIN VS AMOXICILLIN/CLAVULANIC ACID: A double-blind placebo-controlled randomized multicentric study with two treatment arms enrolling hospitalized patients was conducted. Pristinamycin, 1 g b.i.d., demonstrated an efficacy equivalent to that of the amoxicillin/clavulanic acid combination, 500 mg x 4/d. IN CLINICAL PRACTICE: Pristinamycin is effective for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia. Comparative studies including a large number of penicillin-resistant pneumococci remain to be performed, but the first intention use of pristinamycin is already fully warranted in patients at risk treated in an outpatient setting.
