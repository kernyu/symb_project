The transferability of vancomycin (VCM) to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was studied employing rabbits with experimental meningitis caused by Staphylococcus aureus. VCM was administered intravenously for 30 minutes at a dose level of 30 mg/kg. Serum concentration reached a maximum of 75 +/- 3.80 micrograms/ml (mean +/- S.E.) at the completion of administration (i.e., 30 minutes) and CSF concentration reached a maximum of 2.4 +/- 0.39 micrograms/ml at 60 minutes. Pharmacokinetic parameters calculated from this concentration-time curve were as follows: Cmax (CSF/Serum) 3.21%, AUC (CSF/Serum) 2.39% between 15 and 60 minutes, 3.99% between 15 and 120 minutes, and 4.40% between 15 and 150 minutes. T 1/2 for VCM in CSF: 143 minutes, T1/2 (CSF/Serum):2.09. Based on this investigation, VCM appears to be effective in the treatment of meningitis caused by MRSA (Methicillin-resistant S. aureus).
