The paper outlines difficulties in tuberculosis diagnosis and effectiveness of various methods of mycobacteria identification. The latter along with direct and indirect determination of mycobacterial drug resistance require perfection. There is a need in investigation of diagnostic samples from tuberculous and respiratory sarcoidosis patients for mycobacterial granular forms. A multimodality diagnostic approach to examination of clinical material from tuberculous patients is advocated.
