Traditional medicines contain various metabolites derived from nucleic acid, protein, and lipid metabolism. Some of these specific metabolites may recognize the differences between viral and host metabolism resulting in anti-viral activity; hence traditional medicines may be useful sources for new antiviral agents. Traditional medicines can be cheaply obtained and have been orally administered as hot-water extracts. Therefore, they may be used for the prophylactic and therapeutic treatment of viral infection by drinking them, such as coffee or tea. Here we describe how the antiviral activity of traditional medicines was screened in vitro and how their therapeutic antiviral activities were verified in vivo, to obtain traditional antiviral medicines that can be clinically used. Therefore, we have selected 12 herbal extracts, from more than 250 herbal medicines, that exhibit therapeutic activities against cutaneous herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 1 (HSV-1) infection in mice. Four of the 12 augmented the therapeutic efficacy of acyclovir (ACV) in mice and showed potent anti-HSV activity against infection with ACV-resistant HSV-1 mutants in mice. These herbal extracts selectively inhibited viral DNA synthesis and showed a different mode of anti-HSV-1 action from that of ACV. They were also effective against both recurrent HSV and cytomegalovirus infections, without toxicity. Such prophylactic and therapeutic antiviral activities of the traditional medicines were verified by the purification of major active compounds. We could show new indications of traditional medicines as antiviral agents. Thus, the drinking of the extracts, in a daily tea or coffee, may be used for prophylaxis and therapy of diseases caused by herpes virus infection and improve the quality of life.
