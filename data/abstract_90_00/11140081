Intravenous vancomycin was approved in 1991 in Japan and has been widely used for treatment of infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Consequently, ever since the initial discovery of vancomycin intermediate-resistant S. aureus in Japan, the vancomycin resistance of this organism has been a great concern in clinical settings. We investigated whether vancomycin resistance had emerged in MRSA isolated in our hospital since the approval of the use of intravenous vancomycin. Vancomycin susceptibility was evaluated on the basis of minimum inhibitory concentrations determined by the agar dilution method and a heterogeneous resistance examination. The median minimum inhibitory concentration of the 69 MRSA strains isolated in 1988 and the 74 isolated in 1998 was 0.75 microgram/ml and 1.0 microgram/ml, respectively (p < 0.001), however, all of the strains were classified in the susceptible group. None of them was an MRSA heterogeneously resistant to vancomycin (hetero-VRSA), which has been defined as a strain having a 1/10(6) or greater heterogeneously resistant subpopulation to vancomycin. In another set of investigations, no hetero-VRSA were found among 12 other MRSA strains isolated after intravenous administration of vancomycin for 14 or more days (range: 14 to 77 days). We conclude that while the use of intravenous vancomycin may have slightly lowered the vancomycin susceptibility of MRSA in our hospital, the decrease in so small that it may not be significant clinically. In addition, no hetero-VRSA were found in our hospial.
