The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICS) and minimum mycoplasmacidal concentrations (MMCs) of danofloxacin, florfenicol, oxytetracycline, spectinomycin and tilmicosin against 62 recent British field isolates of Mycoplasma bovis were determined in vitro by a broth microdilution method. The isolates were most susceptible todanofloxacin with MIC90 and MMC90 values of 0.5 microg/ml and 1.0 microg/ml, respectively. They were less susceptible to florfenicol with a MIC90 of 16 microg/ml and MMC90 of 32 microg/ml. Oxytetracycline and spectinomycin had only a limited effect against the majority of isolates tested with MIC50s of 32 microg/ml and 4 microg/ml, respectively and MIC90s of 64 microg/ml and more than 128 microg/ml, respectively. Nearly 20 per cent of the isolates were highly resistant to spectinomycin, and tilmicosin was ineffective, with 92 per cent of the isolates having MIC values of 128 microg/ml or greater. There was no evidence of resistance by M bovis to danofloxacin.
