Twenty-three norfloxacin-selected first-step mutants of Streptococcus pneumoniae showed low-level fluoroquinolone resistance. Their susceptibility to norfloxacin in the presence or absence of reserpine and known efflux pump substrates was determined by an agar dilution method. Five mutants showed four- to eightfold increases in their susceptibility to norfloxacin in the presence of reserpine and four- to eightfold decreases in their susceptibility to acriflavine and ethidium bromide. This phenotype is suggestive of an efflux mechanism of resistance. A representative of these mutants, 1N27, accumulated significantly less ethidium bromide than the parent strain; reserpine abolished these differences. No changes in the quinolone resistance-determining regions of parC, parE, gyrA, or gyrB were found in this mutant. By our validated agar dilution method, the efflux phenotype was sought in clinical isolates of S. pneumoniae. Of 1,037 clinical isolates examined from the United Kingdom, 273 showed reduced susceptibility to norfloxacin or ciprofloxacin. Of these, 45.4% showed the efflux phenotype. Our findings suggest that an efflux mechanism may be a frequent cause of clinically significant fluoroquinolone resistance in pneumococci.
