OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the risk factors associated with the emergence of fluconazole resistant Candida spp. in HIV-infected patients with oral candidiasis. METHODS: Candida spp. were isolated from oral swabs and tested in vitro for resistance to fluconazole. The factors potentially correlated with vazole-resistent Candida spp. infections were investigated. RESULTS: Fifty-one out of 118 patients (43%) with oral candidiasis had fluconazole resistant Candida spp. The following factors were significantly associated with the development of fluconazole resistance: (1) more than five episodes of oral candidiasis in the previous year (P < 0.001); (2) fluconazole therapy in the previous 6 months (P < 0.001); (3) C3 category of HIV infection (P < 0.001); and (4) low number of TCD4+ cells (< 50 mm3, P = 0.002). According to multivariate analysis, previous therapy with fluconazole was the only risk factor that independently influenced the development of Candida spp. resistance (P = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: The prophylaxis and therapy of mild fungal infections in HIV-infected patients, which may lead to azole resistance, should be carefully considered.
