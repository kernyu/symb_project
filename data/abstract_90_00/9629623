Despite few efforts to develop new antimalarial compounds by the major pharmaceutical companies, some promising new therapeutics have been developed and tested clinically by small groups and companies throughout the world. Really new substances are scarce but combinations of known medicarnents have been shown to be a rational and effective approach to overcome problems with single compounds. Additionally, combination regimens are more easily authorized and accepted for treatment than completely new substances. Some examples in this respect are combinations of either atovaquone, doxycycline or clindamycin with a 'classical' antimalarial. Artemisinin, benflumetol and pyronaridine were originally developed in China and disperse currently to the rest of the world. First independent and international clinical trials gave promising results and one should bear in mind those substances for future applications. Especially artemisinin and its derivatives are of great interest because they represent, besides quinine, the only other therapeutic option for the treatment of multidrug-resistant severe malaria.
