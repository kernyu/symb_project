P-glycoproteins can cause resistance of mammalian tumor cells to chemotherapeutic drugs. They belong to an evolutionarily well-conserved family of ATP binding membrane transporters. Four P-glycoprotein gene homologs have been found in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans; this report describes the functional analysis of two. We found that PGP-3 is expressed in both the apical membrane of the excretory cell and in the apical membrane of intestinal cells, whereas PGP-1 is expressed only in the apical membrane of the intestinal cells and the intestinal valve. By transposon-mediated deletion mutagenesis we generated nematode strains with deleted P-glycoprotein genes and found that the pgp-3 deletion mutant, but not the pgp-1 mutant, is sensitive to both colchicine and chloroquine. Our results suggest that soil nematodes have P-glycoproteins to protect themselves against toxic compounds made by plants and microbes in the rhizosphere.
