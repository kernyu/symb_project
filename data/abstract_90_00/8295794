The amounts of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) in homogenates of infective-stage larvae of strains, from different countries, of Haemonchus contortus, Ostertagia circumcincta and Trichostrongylus colubriformis resistant or susceptible to benzimidazole (BZ) anthelmintics, were compared using a rapid colorimetric assay. The levels of AChE were much greater in those strains which were BZ-resistant than in BZ-susceptible populations. The larvae of susceptible and resistant H. contortus contained less AChE than did the larvae of the other two species. One-way analysis of variance showed that the observed differences between susceptible and resistant strains were significant in each of the species studied. It is suggested that the extra enzyme may act as an anthelmintic-detoxifying enzyme, may inactivate the active site of the anthelmintic or may prevent binding of the anthelmintic to its receptor.
