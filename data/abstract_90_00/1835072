Imipenem is a beta-lactam antibiotic active against most Gram-negative bacilli. Between July 1, 1987 and September 30, 1989 (9 semesters), the activity of imipenem against 6 micro-organisms was tested in two intensive care units attached to the university hospital of Caen (Normandy). During the same period, the consumption of imipenem was evaluated from the number of vials drawn by each of these two units from the central pharmacy. Imipenem was found to be 100 percent effective against 5 of the 6 micro-organisms tested, but transient falls in sensitivity and an increase in imipenem consumption were observed when Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the pathogen. The most probable cause of these transient decreases of imipenem activity against Ps. aeruginosa was the existence of a resistant strain which showed a protein abnormality in its outer membrane by temporary selection pressure.
