Cefotaxime has retained its broad-spectrum activity against the key pathogens in surgical infection, despite 15 years of widespread use. It has good activity against a wide range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative aerobes and most anaerobes, except Bacteroides fragilis but, combined with metronidazole, it offers clinically complete coverage of B. fragilis and Escherichia coli, the two most important species involved in intra-abdominal infections. For mixed infections involving B. fragilis, 500 mg metronidazole 12-hourly should be added to the cefotaxime regimen. Cefotaxime therapy is simple, generally inexpensive and has a relatively broad spectrum of activity compared to many other antimicrobials used for postoperative nosocomial pneumonia. Treatment with cefotaxime at 1 g or 2 g can be 12-hourly. Surgical prophylaxis with single-dose cefotaxime (1 g or 2 g) is as effective as with many other agents, with no documented selection of resistance. Clinical experience gained worldwide strongly supports the use of cefotaxime for the treatment of prophylaxis and surgical infections.
