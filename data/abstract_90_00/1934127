Mutants of Aspergillus nidulans resistant to the aminoglycoside antibiotics paromomycin and hygromycin B have been isolated and their growth characteristics are described here. Most paromomycin mutants were cross-resistant to hygromycin and geneticin. All the hygromycin-resistant mutants were slightly cross-resistant to geneticin. Out of the 15 mutants tested 14 had drug-resistant ribosomes in vitro and all 12 of those investigated further had reduced levels of translational misreading. Five new loci have been found--parA on linkage group I, hygA on III, hygB on IV, hygC on V, hygD on VI and parB on VIII. This increases, to at least 12, the number of translational fidelity loci in A. nidulans.
