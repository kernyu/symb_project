Plasmodium falciparum resistance to chloroquine has been described in many parts of the world particularly in Africa where malaria is endemic. High levels of chloroquine resistance in our study area, Lambarene-Gabon, has led to the use of an alternative regimen for treatment and prevention of P. falciparum infection. In this study, we examined the in vitro chloroquine sensitivity of 15 isolates from this area and assessed the prevalence of a putative chloroquine resistance associated Pfmdr1 polymorphism (Asn86Tyr) using a novel allele-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Only 4 of the isolates examined were chloroquine sensitive. The allele-specific PCR shows that all 15 isolates carried the variant (86Tyr) codon. Eleven of these were resistant to chloroquine suggesting a 73% agreement between chloroquine resistance phenotype and the point mutation. This molecular marker was examined in a further 73 Gabonese isolates, where 58 (79.5%) showed 86Tyr and 15 (20.5%) showed 86Asn. In all, 4 (4.5%) of the 88 isolates assessed carry both mutant and wild-type codons, suggesting mixed parasite populations. The incomplete agreement found between chloroquine resistance phenotype and Pfmdr1 (86Tyr) polymorphism would support the view that other genetic factors as well as Pfmdr1 may be involved in chloroquine resistance. While our results suggest a high prevalence of 86Tyr polymorphism in Lambarene, the Asp1246Tyr polymorphism (a point mutation which to date has only been associated with South American P. falciparum) seems to be absent in our study area.
