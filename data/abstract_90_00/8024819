Significant insight has been gained in the past year into the roles of salicylic acid (SA) in plant-pathogen interactions. The ability to accumulate SA has been shown to be essential for systemic acquired resistance in tobacco plants. Further experiments have shown that SA is apparently not a systemic, vascular-mobile signal, but rather is required for signal transduction at the local level. Its mode of action may include inhibition of catalase activity, leading to increased levels of hydrogen peroxide.
