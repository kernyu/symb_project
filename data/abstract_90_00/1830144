The therapeutic, preventive and curative, habits concerning malaria of expatriates living in Brazzaville, Congo, were investigated on two occasions. In March 1989 and April 1990, a questionnaire was handed out to the pupils of the French school to be filled in by their parents. Three quarters of the expatriates are Europeans, and 85 percent of these are French. In this country where the chemoresistance of Plasmodium falciparum has been established since 1985, chemoprophylaxis was regularly performed by expatriates during their first years of residence to diminish later on; in 1989 it was still practised by more than 50 percent of adults who had been living in the tropics for more than 10 years, but in 1990 this proportion had fallen to 35 percent. Chemoprophylaxis is provided by chloroquine in 3 out of 4 persons and by amodiaquine in 1 out of 5. Mefloquine and the chloroquine-proguanil combination are still rarely prescribed as preventive treatments. About 50 percent of the expatriates have had at least on attack of malaria in the previous 2 years, with or without chemoprophylaxis and irrespective of the measures taken to avoid mosquito bites. Mosquito nets, never sprayed with insecticides, are little used, but air-conditioning at night is favoured by 80 percent of the population studied. Curative treatment was distinctly altered between 1989 and 1990, with a rapidly increasing use of mefloquine or halofantrine after confirmation of the diagnosis or as presumptive therapy.
