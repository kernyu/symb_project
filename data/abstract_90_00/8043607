Proteus vulgaris RO104 strain produces a chromosomally encoded beta-lactamase that confers resistance to various beta-lactam antibiotics including methoxyimino third-generation cephalosporins. The beta-lactamase hydrolyzes first- and second-generation cephalosporins efficiently and cefotaxime to a lesser extent. Catalytic activity is inhibited by low concentrations of clavulanic acid and sulbactam. By its broad-spectrum substrate profile, beta-lactamase of Proteus vulgaris RO104 belongs to the group 2e defined by Bush. The protein purified to homogeneity by a four-step procedure was characterized by a pI of 8.31 and a specific activity of 1200 U/mg. The beta-lactamase was digested by trypsin, endoproteinase Asp-N and chymotrypsin. Amino-acid sequence determinations of the resulting peptides allowed the alignment of the 271 amino-acid residues of the protein which did not contain any cysteine residue. From amino-acid sequence comparisons, Proteus vulgaris RO104 beta-lactamase was found to share about 68% identity with the chromosomally mediated beta-lactamases of Klebsiella oxytoca D488 and E23004. Therefore, the cephalosporin-hydrolyzing beta-lactamase of Proteus vulgaris RO104 belongs to Ambler's class A.
