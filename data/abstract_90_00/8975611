Ruminal amino acid degradation is a nutritionally wasteful process that produces excess ruminal ammonia. Monensin inhibited the growth of monensin-sensitive, obligate amino acid-fermenting bacteria and decreased the ruminal ammonia concentrations of cattle. 16S rRNA probes indicated that monensin inhibited the growth of Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and Clostridium sticklandii in the rumen. Clostridium aminophilum was monensin sensitive in vitro, but C. aminophilum persisted in the rumen after monensin was added to the diet. An in vitro culture system was developed to assess the competition of C. aminophilum, P. anaerobius, and C. sticklandii with predominant ruminal bacteria (PRB). PRB were isolated from a 10(8) dilution of ruminal fluid and maintained as a mixed population with a mixture of carbohydrates. PRB did not hybridize with the probes to C. aminophilum, P. anaerobius, or C. sticklandii. PRB deaminated Trypticase in continuous culture, but the addition of C. aminophilum, P. anaerobius, and C. sticklandii caused a more-than-twofold increase in the steady-state concentration of ammonia. C. aminophilum, P. anaerobius, and C. sticklandii accounted for less than 5% of the total 16S rRNA and microbial protein. Monensin eliminated P. anaerobius and C. sticklandii from continuous cultures, but it could not inhibit C. aminophilum. The monensin resistance of C. aminophilum was a growth rate-dependent, inoculum size-independent phenomenon that could not be maintained in batch culture. On the basis of these results, we concluded that the feed additive monensin cannot entirely counteract the wasteful amino acid deamination of obligate amino acid-fermenting ruminal bacteria.
