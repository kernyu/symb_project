A strain of Salmonella typhimurium isolated from a decubitus ulcer that was being treated topically with half-strength Dakin's solution became H2S negative, nitrate negative, and unable to produce gas from glucose. Experimental data suggested that these effects were associated with the development of chlorate resistance. Thirty-five other strains of Salmonella spp. that were made chlorate resistant also became negative for these three tests.
