Treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected persons with potent antiretroviral combination therapy results in a strong decline of the viral load in the blood. Whether this effect is reached in all tissues and different infected cell types is an important question. There are several potential virus reservoirs. Lymphoid tissue constitutes the largest virus compartment. With potent, often protease inhibitor containing combinations the HIV-RNA decline in lymphoid tissue runs parallel to that in the blood. The central nervous tissue is a potentially important reservoir, because of the limited penetration of several antiretrovirals, especially protease inhibitors. A few short studies with different combinations showed a decline of the amount of virus in the cerebrospinal fluid. The risk of local resistance developing is not known. There are only few studies of the effects of potent anti-HIV therapy on semen but prostate and testis tissue do not appear inaccessible to treatment. The reservoir of latently infected cells that cannot be reached by the immune system or by the viral replication inhibiting therapy, can possibly be reached with immune stimulating agents. This will cause HIV replication and cell death, while the anti-HIV therapy will prevent further replication of the produced virions. This approach is still experimental, however.
