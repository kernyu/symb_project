The electrophysiological effects of mucosal or submucosal ethanol (5, 10, or 20%) were assessed in isolated stomach preparation. Mucosal incubation with these concentrations of ethanol dose- and time-dependently decreased the transmucosal potential difference (PD), while the electrical current (I) and resistance (R) were unaffected. Submucosal exposure to the same concentrations of ethanol also reduced the PD, but to a lesser extent; only 20% of ethanol produced a significant effect. This same dose of ethanol not only decreased I but also increased R to a significant level. These findings indicate that transmucosal PD appears to be generated largely by the mucosal epithelial cell barrier, while the I and R are elicited by the laminea propria mucosa which is easily approached and altered by ethanol which acts from the submucosal side. The significance of the effects produced by mucosal or submucosal ethanol is discussed.
