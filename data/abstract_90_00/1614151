Two patient histories show that the therapy of contact lens corneal ulcers is complicated by bacterial resistance and mixed infection. To start an effective therapy against pseudomonas, gram-negative as well as gram-positive germs, a primary combination of tobramycin with fusidic acid seems to us as reasonable. Because of possible resistance to these antibiotics a smear should be taken from the ulcer and the contact lens case before therapy is begun and the clinical evolution must be controlled. In the choice of the antibiotics, the actual state of resistance and commercial availability was taken into account.
