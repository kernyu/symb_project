A strain of Bacteroides fragilis, which produces a metallo-beta-lactamase, was inoculated into pouches on the backs of rats together with a beta-lactamase-negative Escherichia coli highly sensitive to beta-lactam antibiotics. The mixed infection rat pouch model was treated with either flomoxef (susceptible to hydrolysis by the beta-lactamase produced by B. fragilis), or cefmetazole (relatively resistant to hydrolysis). In this model of mixed infection flomoxef showed weak in-vivo activity against E. coli, although showing the same strong activity in a model of single infection with E. coli. On the other hand, cefmetazole showed strong activity against E. coli, even in the model of mixed infection. The concentrations of both drugs in the pouches were decreased in infections with the strain of B. fragilis. There was a greater decrease in the concentration of flomoxef than of cefmetazole. Flomoxef was unstable whereas cefmetazole was relatively stable in the pouch exudates that had been infected with B. fragilis. These experimental data suggest that bacteria that produce a metallo-beta-lactamase decrease the in-vivo efficacy of beta-lactam antibiotics against other co-infecting bacteria. Thus, it is suggested that it is important in the chemotherapy of mixed bacterial infections that include these highly resistant beta-lactamase-producing bacteria to use antibiotics that are stable to hydrolysis by these enzymes.
