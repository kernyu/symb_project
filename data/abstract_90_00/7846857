Ecologically sustainable development is aimed at reducing environmental degradation while enabling economic development with equity between the developed and developing worlds and between generations. Parasite control in livestock can both contribute to, and take advantage of, sustainable agriculture. This will tend towards less intensive, lower input, diversified crop and animal production with less risk of parasite-induced losses and greater opportunities for integrated control including the exploitation of grazing management. Chemotherapy will continue to play a part but the most serious problem is resistance in the target species. Except for a few isolated issues, currently used parasiticides are relatively minor contaminants of the food supply or the environment. Nevertheless, the compounds of the future will need to be narrow-spectrum, non-persistent and rapidly degraded, with convenience in the hands of the user reduced in importance. Environmentally friendly alternatives to chemotherapy, including genetic resistance of hosts, vaccines, and biological control, show considerable promise and must be pursued. Sustainable systems pose optimisation problems and more attention must be given to systems research, models and products to aid decisions. If governments are serious about sustainable development, greater support will be needed for longer-term patient, multi-disciplinary research.
