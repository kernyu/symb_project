We adopted the method of miminum inhibitary concentration (MIC) assay according to the method recommened by National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standard (NCCLS), and selected 2 fluconazole--susceptible strains from over 50 strains of Candida albicans which were preserved in our center (these strains were all isolated from clinical patients). The number of the strains are: BMU8945 (MIC value is 0.125 microgram/ml) and BMU8977 (MIC value is 0.25 microgram/ml). In addition, we also picked one strain of ATCC14053 (MIC value is 0.5 microgram/ml) as our research starting strains. After the induction of UV and DES, we obtained nearly 1000 colonies of fluconazole--resistant strains (MIC > 30 micrograms/ml). After subculture, we found that the characterization of drug--resistance of these strains could be inheredited stably.
