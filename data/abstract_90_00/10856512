Closantel binds to the serum proteins of the host and affects blood sucking parasites when they ingest the blood of treated hosts. Closantel binds specifically to ovine serum albumin (K(a) of 9. 3x10(6)M(-1)) at site I, the warfarin/phenylbutazone binding site of albumin Closantel also binds to invertebrate haemocyanin and haemolymph. The strongest binding of closantel in homogenates of H. contortus is found in fractions containing soluble proteins. This binding is of low affinity and, because the site itself is not fully denaturable, it may not be proteinaceous. There is no detectable difference in binding affinity between homogenate fractions from closantel susceptible and resistant isolates of adult or larval worms suggesting that closantel resistance is not due to changes in the closantel receptor or carrier.
