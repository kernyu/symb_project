Optimum treatment of tuberculosis in persons with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is still being defined. Tuberculosis treatment failure in an HIV-infected patient is described and 10 similar cases from the medical literature are reviewed to search for common patterns associated with an adverse outcome of therapy in this setting. Six patients were poorly compliant. In nine patients, the subsequent episode of tuberculosis was disseminated or extrapulmonary; in four the central nervous system was involved. In five patients, a problem with rifampin usage was encountered: Three had rifampin-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis, one experienced an adverse reaction to rifampin, leading to withdrawal from the regimen after 1 week, and one was receiving a drug that may interfere with rifampin's antimycobacterial effect. This case report and literature review suggest that particular attention should be directed toward ensuring that patients with HIV infection comply with treatment of tuberculosis. For the majority of patients, the already stretched resources available for the treatment of tuberculosis and HIV infection should be devoted to compliance enhancement rather than to more prolonged or intensive drug regimens. However, it should be emphasized that patients with disseminated tuberculosis or central nervous system disease and those who are not able to receive rifampin because of drug resistance or an adverse reaction should be managed individually.
