Many chemical entities, either from natural sources or prepared by synthesis, are known to exert stimulating activities on various functions of the immune system, such as antibody production, resistance to infections, rejection of malignant cells, etc. In this review, the origin, chemical structures and main activities of several immunostimulants are described, with special emphasis on their present or potential medical usefulness. An attempt is made to envisage the future of this type of pharmacological agents, excluding however from the presentation the endogenous modulators of the immune system (cytokines), the production and activities of which are influenced by the immunostimulants themselves.
