The susceptibilities of 316 gram-positive bacteremic isolates to ramoplanin, vancomycin, and teicoplanin and seven other antibiotics were tested. Ramoplanin demonstrated MICs of < or = 0.25 microgram/ml for at least 99% of Staphylococcus aureus isolates and 100% of coagulase-negative staphylococci tested. For both oxacillin-susceptible and oxacillin-resistant S. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci, the activity of ramoplanin surpassed those of both vancomycin and teicoplanin. Ramoplanin and teicoplanin had comparable activities against enterococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae and were superior to vancomycin.
