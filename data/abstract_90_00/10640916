BACKGROUND: Peroxynitrite plays an important role in the pathogenesis of airway inflammation. We have already found that peroxynitrite may contribute to decreased beta(2)-adrenoceptor responses in airway smooth muscle. However, it is not known whether peroxynitrite can alter neutral endopeptidase (EC 3.4.24.11; NEP) activity in the airways. This study was designed to determine whether peroxynitrite induces airway hyperresponsiveness to substance P (SP) and endothelin-1 (ET-1) through the inactivation of airway NEP. METHODS: We examined whether the administration of S-morpholinosydnonimine (SIN-1), a compound that releases peroxynitrite, increased bronchoconstrictor responses to SP and ET-1 in anesthetized guinea pigs. In addition, we assayed NEP activity in the airways of SIN-1-exposed guinea pigs. RESULTS: Though SIN-1 (10(-7) M) alone had no effect on pulmonary resistance, pretreatment with SIN-1 significantly enhanced SP- and ET-1-induced bronchoconstriction. Pretreatment with phosphoramidon, an NEP inhibitor, also enhanced SP- and ET-1-induced bronchoconstriction. However, simultaneous administration of phosphoramidon and SIN-1 had no additive effect on SP- and ET-1-induced bronchoconstriction. Peroxynitrite formation by SIN-1 was completely inhibited by N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and glutathione (GSH) in vitro, and pretreatment with NAC and GSH significantly reversed the potentiation by SIN-1 of SP-induced bronchoconstriction. In addition, the NEP activity of the trachea after SIN-1 exposure was significantly reduced compared to the level in control guinea pigs (solvent for SIN-1: 30.0+/-4.2 fmol.min(-1).mg tissue(-1); 10(-7) M SIN-1; 15.5+/-4.5 fmol.min(-1).mg tissue(-1), p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that peroxynitrite induces airway hyperresponsiveness to SP and ET-1 through the inactivation of airway NEP, and that peroxynitrite is an important mediator of the alterations in airway functions.
