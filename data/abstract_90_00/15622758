OBJECTIVE: To explore measures to overcome multidrug resistance of tumor cells. METHODS: The effects of cyclosporin A (CsA) on drug sensitivity, intracellular drug accumulation and drug efflux in multidrug-resistant human leukemic cell line K562/DOX were studied by MTT colorimetric assay and spectrofluorimetry. RESULTS: CsA enhanced the cytotoxicity of doxorubicin (DOX) to K562/DOX, and when CsA > or = 2microg/ml the sensitivity of K562/DOX to DOX increased significantly. The efflux of DOX markedly decreased when K562/DOX cells were incubated with 2microg/ml CsA, while CsA had no effect on efflux of DOX in K562 cells. CONCLUSION: CsA could markedly decrease the efflux and enhance the intracellular accumulation of DOX in K562/DOX cells.
