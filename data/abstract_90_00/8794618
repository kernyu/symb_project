The standard antituberculous treatment consists during the first 2 months of daily rifampin 10 mg/kg, isoniazid 4-5 mg/kg and pyrazinamide 25 mg/kg, with ethambutol 20 mg/kg in case of suspicion of drug resistance. The second phase of treatment consists of 4 months rifampin and isoniazid at the same daily dosage. Two or three drugs combination pills simplify the treatment. An early treatment and a good follow up are prognostic factors of individual success and tuberculosis epidemic reduction. In case of multidrug resistance, susceptibility tests should be obtained before new initiation of treatment.
