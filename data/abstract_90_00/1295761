A nationwide survey of the susceptibility of 433 isolates of Bacteroides fragilis and 149 isolates of Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron was conducted from December 1986 through November 1989 in Japan. These strains were collected from 16 university hospitals and one metropolitan hospital. Metronidazole was the most active drug against both species, with no resistant isolates found. The activity of imipenem and sulbactam-cefoperazone was good, with very low resistance rates determined in Bacteroides fragilis (1.4% and 1.6%, respectively) and in Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (3.4% for both drugs), and was comparable to that of metronidazole. Cefoxitin, cefmetazole, cefotetan, cefbuperazone, latamoxef and ceftizoxime were found to be more active against Bacteroides fragilis, for which resistance rates were 3.2 to 9.5%, than against Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, for which resistance rates were 18.1 to 21.8%. Rates of piperacillin resistance in the two species were 12.9% and 26.8%, respectively. Clindamycin was very active at a low concentration (MIC50 of 0.39 to 1.56 mg/l), but 24% and 27.5% of Bacteroides fragilis and Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron isolates, respectively, were resistant to this agent.
