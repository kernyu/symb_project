The in-vitro activities of imipenem and four beta-lactam-beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations were tested against 816 strains of the Bacteroides fragilis group, and compared with other anti-anaerobic agents. None of the strains was resistant to metronidazole, and only one was resistant to chloramphenicol. Mezlocillin and piperacillin were moderately active, while clindamycin was the least active. Rates of resistance varied between various species. The new beta-lactam agents tested showed excellent activity; piperacillin-tazobactam and imipenem were the most active. The emergence of strains that are resistant to these agents, observed in this study, suggests there is a need to perform periodic antimicrobial susceptibility tests.
