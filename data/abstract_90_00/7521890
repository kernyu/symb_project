Fas/APO-1 is a transmembrane protein of the nerve growth factor/TNF alpha receptor family which signals apoptotic cell death in susceptible target cells. We have investigated the susceptibility of seven human malignant glioma cell lines to Fas/APO-1-dependent apoptosis. Sensitivity to Fas/APO-1 antibody-mediated cell killing correlated with cell surface expression of Fas/APO-1. Expression of Fas/APO-1 as well as Fas/APO-1-dependent cytotoxicity were augmented by preexposure of human malignant glioma cells to IFN gamma and TNF alpha. Further, pretreatment with TGF beta 2, IL1 and IL8 enhanced Fas/APO-1 antibody-induced glioma cell apoptosis whereas other cytokines including TNF beta, IL6, macrophage colony-stimulating factor, IL10 and IL13 had no such effect. None of the human malignant glioma cell lines was susceptible to TNF alpha-induced cytotoxicity. Fas/APO-1 antibody-sensitive glioma cell lines (n = 5), but not Fas/APO-1 antibody-resistant glioma cell lines (n = 2), became sensitive to TNF alpha when co-treated with inhibitors of RNA and protein synthesis. Resistance of human glioma cells to Fas/APO-1 antibody-mediated apoptosis was mainly related to low level expression of Fas/APO-1 and appeared not to be linked to overexpression of the anti-apoptotic protooncogene, bcl-2. Given the resistance of human malignant glioma to surgery, irradiation, chemotherapy and immunotherapy, we propose that Fas/APO-1 may be a promising target for a novel locoregionary approach to human malignant glioma. This strategy gains support from the demonstration of Fas/APO-1 expression in ex vivo human malignant glioma specimens and from the absence of Fas/APO-1 in normal human brain parenchyma.
