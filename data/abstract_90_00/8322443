Between April 1984 and November 1986, 126 faeces samples were collected from puppies and bitches in a kennel and examined for Yersinia species; 45 (35.7 per cent) of them were positive. Thirty-eight isolates were Y enterocolitica, five were Y frederiksenii and two were Y intermedia. Twenty-one of the Y enterocolitica isolates belonged to serogroup 0:3 and 17 of these were L-sorbose negative; all these isolates were from puppies. One strain of Y frederiksenii and all the L-sorbose-negative Y enterocolitica serogroup 0:3 isolates were resistant to antimicrobial agents and showed four different patterns of resistance (ampicillin, cephalothin and tetracycline; ampicillin, cephalothin, streptomycin and tetracycline; ampicillin, chloramphenicol, cephalothin, streptomycin and sulfathiazole; and ampicillin, chloramphenicol, cephalothin, streptomycin, sulfathiazole and tetracycline. In January 1986, investigations were conducted on a cattle farm and a pig farm close to the kennel. Of 19 bovine faeces samples 11 (57.8 per cent) were positive for Yersinia species; eight yielded Y enterocolitica and four yielded Y frederiksenii. None of the Y enterocolitica isolates belonged to serogroup 0:3. Of 20 porcine faeces samples eight (40 per cent) were positive for Yersinia species; all eight yielded Y enterocolitica and four also yielded Y pseudotuberculosis. Two of the isolates of Y frederiksenii and two of the isolates of Y enterocolitica from the farms had the following resistance patterns: ampicillin, cephalothin and streptomycin; ampicillin, streptomycin and tetracycline; ampicillin, chloramphenicol, cephalothin, streptomycin, trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole and tetracycline; and ampicillin, chloramphenicol, cephalothin, streptomycin, sulphatiazole, trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole and tetracycline.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
