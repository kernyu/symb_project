A study was undertaken at RML Hospital, Delhi to examine the bacterial infections of burn cases and determine the antibiograms of the isolates to commonly used antimicrobial agents. A total of 489 pus samples from as many patients received, over a period of three years (January 1992 to December, 1994) yielded 793 isolates. Pseudomonas sp. was the commonest (53.9%) followed by Klebsiella sp. (35.1%) Staphylococcus aureus (30.6%) Proteus sp. (23.5%). Esch. coli (14.1%) and others (4.9%). The most resistant isolate to commonly used antimicrobial was Klebsiella sp. (16.4%), followed by Esch. coli (15.4%) Pseudomonas sp. (15.2%) Proteus sp. (7.8%) and Staphylococcus aureus (4.6%). The infection of burn wounds with multiple organisms, with superadded problem of drug resistance, indicate the institution of a drug policy by the hospitals for burns patients.
