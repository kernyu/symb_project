In order to evaluate antimicrobial activity of cefcapene (CFPN), minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of CFPN and reference drugs were determined against clinical isolates from respiratory tract infection of out patients that were obtained in our laboratory from January to June of 1997. The results are summarized as follows; 1. The MIC90 of CFPN against penicillin (PC)-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae (PSSP) was equal to those of benzylpenicillin (PCG), ampicillin (ABPC) and cefditoren (CDTR), and was lower than those of cefaclor (CCL), cefdinir (CFDN) and erythromycin (EM). 2. The MIC90 of CFPN against PC-intermediate S. pneumoniae (PISP)/PC-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP) was equal to that of CDTR, and was lower than those of PCG, ABPC, CCL, CFDN and EM. CFPN showing strong antimicrobial activities against PISP. 3. CFPN showed strong antimicrobial activities against beta-lactamase producing and non-producing Haemophilus influenzae. The MIC90 of CFPN was stronger than those of ABPC, CCL, CFDN and EM, and was approximately equal to that of CDTR. CFPN also showed strong antimicrobial activities against strains which did not produce any beta-lactamase and were resistant to CCL with MIC of > or = 25 micrograms/ml. 4. Antimicrobial activities of CFPN against Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis was stronger than that of ABPC and CCL, though the MIC90 of CFPN was rather high, 3.13 micrograms/ml. 5. CFPN showed strong antimicrobial activities against PISP and beta-lactamase producing H. influenzae, and also against the CCL-resistant H. influenzae indicative mutations of penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). From those results, cefcapen-pivoxil was found to be clinically effective against community acquired respiratory tract infection.
