The number of reports of outbreaks of salmonella gastroenteritis in hospitals has decreased since 1984 but the number of outbreaks in institutions such as old peoples' homes have increased during 1988. Foods, particularly chickens, remain a source of salmonellae and particular attention has to be paid to training and practices in food preparation areas. Staff who are convalescent are very unlikely to be sources of salmonella and do not need to be excluded unless they handle food that receives no further cooking. Outbreaks that do occur can usually be controlled by patient isolation and good control-of-infection measures and an effective Major Outbreak Control Plan is necessary. In some large old hospitals cross infection outbreaks may continue despite good control-of-infection measures. Antibiotics have been contraindicated in the treatment of salmonella gastroenteritis, but the new 4-quinolone antibiotics have demonstrated potential. Ciprofloxacin was used successfully in two outbreaks of salmonella gastroenteritis at a dose of 500 mg bd orally for seven days. Relapses did not occur and resistance did not develop. Ciprofloxacin should be considered as a therapeutic adjunct to control of infection measures in cross infection outbreaks in these situations.
