The overall level of resistance to antimicrobials is high in Europe, most notably in intensive care units. Variations exist across countries, with the levels being highest in southern Europe. Staphylococcus aureus remains the most hazardous pathogen. Glycopeptide-resistant enterococci are relatively infrequent in Europe for the time being. Differences in measures used to control antimicrobial use and to prevent cross-contamination probably explain country-to-country differences in resistance levels. Substantial efforts are needed in both these areas in many countries, including France.
