Campylobacter jejuni is a frequent cause of enteritis and sometimes it requires antimicrobial therapy. We have studied the evolution of resistance to nine antibiotics from 1990 to 1994 and investigated how frequently gyrA mutations are involved in the acquisition of quinolone resistance. The percentage of chloramphenicol-, clindamycin-, tetracycline- and amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid-resistant strains has remained practically unchanged and erythromycin and gentamicin resistance has decreased, whereas the percentage of ampicillin-, nalidixic acid- or ciprofloxacin-resistant strains has almost doubled in the follow-up period, from 56 to 76% for ampicillin- and from 47.5 to 88% for quinolone-resistant strains. This study clearly shows that a mutation in Thr-86 to Ile or Lys is a frequent mechanism associated with the acquisition of a high level of resistance to quinolones in clinical isolates of C. jejuni.
