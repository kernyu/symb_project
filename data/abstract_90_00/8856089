Recombinant cytokines such as stem cell factor (SCF) are currently being tested for the ability to ameliorate 3'azido-3'deoxythymidine (AZT) induced anemia in AIDS patients. Recently, we demonstrated that SCF and hemin in vitro greatly increased the resistance of burst-forming units erythroid (BFU-E) to AZT. We therefore attempted to ameliorate AZT-induced anemia in vivo using SCF and hemin in immunodeficient LP-BM5 infected (MAIDS) mice. SCF and hemin were administered with oral AZT for 3 wk and the effects on erythropoiesis examined. Hemin significantly increased hematocrits of AZT-treated mice and control mice. However, SCF and SCF-hemin combinations failed to raise hematocrits. Reticulocyte numbers were significantly consistently increased only in hemin-treated mice receiving AZT. The numbers of CFU-E were increased in bone marrow of AZT-treated mice receiving hemin. Therefore, SCF did not enhance the erythropoietic effect of hemin in AZT-treated immunodeficient mice.
