To elucidate the effect of growth hormone (GH) on the insulin signal transduction pathway leading to the translocation of glucose transporter-4 (GLUT4), we constructed Chinese hamster ovary cells that overexpressed GH receptor and GLUT4. Treatment with GH triggered GLUT4 translocation, and this translocation was completely inhibited by wortmannin. GH-induced GLUT4 translocation reached a maximum level after 30 min, and then gradually decreased and returned to the basal level after 2 h. Tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK2 also became maximal after 30 min and then gradually decreased. In contrast, GLUT4 translocation remained unchanged for 2 h after insulin treatment, and tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) also remained constant for up to 2 h. Chronic GH treatment had almost no effect on insulin-stimulated Akt kinase activation and GLUT4 translocation. These results suggest that GH and insulin translocate GLUT4 in a similar manner, at least in part, and the difference in translocation depends on the difference in the tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK2 and IRS-1. The anti-insulin action of GH after chronic GH treatment does not appear to be mainly due to the inhibition of GLUT4 translocation.
