Two groups of 33 helminth-naive lambs were infected with 5,000 L3 of an ivermectin-resistant or -susceptible strain of Haemonchus contortus (groups R and S). On days 6, 10, 16, and 21 postinfection, 5 animals from each group were chosen at random and orally treated with 0.2 mg/kg of ivermectin. On each occasion, 2 randomly selected lambs from each group were also killed to determine the number and stage of development of the worms present at the time of treatment. These necropsies revealed that by day 6 early and late fourth-stage larvae were present, whereas on day 10 the early fifth stage had been reached; by days 16 and 21 all worms had reached the adult stage. Necropsies on day 28 postinfection revealed that although animals treated at day 6 had 26.3% fewer worms than the controls, there was no significant difference (P greater than 0.05) between worm burdens from any of the animals infected with the R strain and treated at different times after infection when compared with the untreated controls. With ivermectin significant reductions were obtained in the worm burdens of the animals infected with the susceptible strain; these were reduced by 96% when treatment was given on day 6 against fourth-stage larvae and 98.9% when the drug was given on day 21 against adult stages. From these results it is clear that resistance to ivermectin in this strain of H. contortus is present as early as the fourth larval stage.
