Previous studies have shown that the capacity to clear an attenuated strain of Salmonella typhimurium after the second week of infection varies widely among mouse strains. Bacterial clearance is mediated by CD4+ T cells and is regulated in part by the H-2 complex. The aim of the present study was to compare the patterns of cytokine mRNA expression in the spleens of C57BL/6 (H-2b) and CBA (H-2k) mice, which exhibit a low and a high rate of bacterial clearance, respectively. A transient increase in interleukin-12 (IL-12) mRNA levels was found in both mouse strains. Gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) gene expression was higher and more sustained in C57BL/6 than in CBA mice. No increase in IL-4 mRNA was detected. A transient increase in IL-10 mRNA was found in C57BL/6 mice. Separation of spleen cells into CD4+ and CD4- fractions showed that CD4+ T cells produced the bulk of IFN-gamma in both mouse strains and of IL-10 in C57BL/6 mice. Infection of H-2 congenic mice induced a higher level of IFN-gamma mRNA expression by CD4+ T cells in mice with a low rate of clearance (H-2b) than in mice with a high rate of clearance (H-2q). Treatment of infected C57BL/6 mice with anti-IFN-gamma or anti-CD4 monoclonal antibodies indicated that IFN-gamma participates in resistance in the early phase of infection, but not in bacterial clearance, and that CD4+ T cells mediate bacterial clearance during the 3rd week of infection. Taken together, these results suggest that defective bacterial clearance in H-2b mice is not linked to defective IFN-gamma production and that CD4+ T cells mediate bacterial clearance by an IFN-gamma-independent mechanism.
