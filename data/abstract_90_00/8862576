A simple disk diffusion test was defined for quick determination of the susceptibility of Candida species to fluconazole. The standard macrotube dilution reference method, the fluconazole E test, and a 25-microgram fluconazole disk test were all performed with each of 250 Candida species selected to provide a broad range of fluconazole MICs. All three methods were in excellent agreement. On RPMI 1640-glucose agar, isolates with inhibition zone diameters of > or = 19 mm were all susceptible (MIC, < or = 8.0 micrograms/ml) by the E test and 94% were susceptible by the macrotube method. Strains with smaller zones were either resistant, intermediate (dose-dependent susceptibility), or susceptible by the reference methods. The disk test did not adequately separate fully resistant strains from those with dose-dependent susceptibility: additional quantitative tests are needed for the few strains that are not unequivocally susceptible by the disk method.
