Investigations were carried out in the villages of Buhari PHC, Surat district, Gujarat to determine factors responsible for high prevalence of P. falciparum. The area is well-known for sugarcane cultivation, industrialization and frequent movement of labourers. The slide positivity rate (44.24%) and P. falciparum infections (95.37%) were significantly high. The children of 5-9 yrs of age group suffered maximum from malaria. The infection in children was found associated with splenomegaly also. High falciparum infection (82.35%) was found in labourers camping near villages out of which 90% afebrile cases were reported which were silent carriers and source of transmission. Chloroquine was effective in 75% cases despite of existence of resistant falciparum strain. Among seven anopheline species encountered, An. culicifacies was predominant and found breeding in most of the breeding sites. The status of the insecticide spray and its receptivity among the community were poor. The investigation led to the conclusion that adequate measures are required to deal with migratory labourers, improper insecticide coverage, poor surveillance and mass ignorance.
