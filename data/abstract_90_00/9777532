Nasal mupirocin has an important role to play in the prevention of Staphylococcus aureus infection by eliminating nasal carriage of this organism. Indeed, in many countries nasal mupirocin is one of the mainstays for controlling outbreaks of methicillin-resistant S. aureus. Eradication of nasal S. aureus with mupirocin has been shown to be effective in preventing postoperative infections in patients undergoing cardiothoracic surgery and in preventing exit-site infections in patients undergoing haemodialysis. It has been proposed that the use of mupirocin should be extended to other situations, such as the prevention of postoperative infections in patients undergoing implant surgery and the prevention of bacteraemias in high-risk patients. Clinical trials are needed to establish the efficacy of mupirocin in these situations. Both low-level and high-level resistance have been reported during treatment with nasal mupirocin. Low-level resistance does not represent a significant clinical problem but high-level resistance resulting from indiscriminate use may give grounds for concern. Further review of these issues is required. As with any antibiotic, mupirocin should be used judiciously, as part of an integrated programme of infection control.
