Today, CT-guided percutaneous drainage for intraabdominal abscesses of various origin and location is well accepted. With this method open surgery and its complications can be often avoided. We report results of such treatment in 47 patients with intraabdominal abscess formation. 66 "basket" catheters were placed into abscess formations of differing sizes and locations. 27 patients had developed abscess formation after surgery, in 2 patients abscesses after tumorembolisation were drained. In 18 cases there was no previous surgery. No complications occurred. Mean drainage time was 8.5 days. Surgical intervention was avoided in 34/47 patients. 9 of 47 patients received only percutaneous drainage. 25 of 47 patients required concomitant antibiotics for successful treatment. Antibiotics were selected according to bacterial culture with resistance determination. 13/47 cases required secondary surgery. About 80% of intraabdominal abscesses are curable with CT guided percutaneous drainage and systemic antibiotic medication. If a percutaneous drainage fails and signs of infection still remain, the procedure can be repeated. If secondary surgery after failing of percutaneous drainage should become necessary, the extent of the surgical intervention can be reduced. Surgery is necessary, if CT guided percutaneous drainage could not reach the abscess formation, if drainage failed or if an additional illness exists, which requires an operation.
