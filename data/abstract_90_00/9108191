A 17-year-old male patient with extrahepatic biliary atresia underwent an orthotopic liver transplantation in September 1994. In blood cultures drawn in November and (6 weeks later) December 1994, from bile secretions in May 1995, stool in June 1995 an wound abscess in August 1995, ampicillin-resistant Enterococcus faecium was isolated. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis demonstrated the clonal identity of the isolates. To our knowledge, repeated infections with the same E. faecium strain over a period of 9 months have not been described before. As multiple-resistant enterococci may colonize and reinfect liver transplant recipients for such a long time, preoperative antibiotic therapy should be administered cautiously in order not to select these organisms.
