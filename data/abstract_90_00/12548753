Fecal samples from 195 diarrheic patients in different age, rectal and cloacal swabs from 656 normal and diarrheic animals and poultry, 108 visceral materials from the dead animals with diarrhoea were cultured for Compylobacter jejuni. A total of 458 strains of campylobacters (445 strains of C. jejuni, 13 strains of C. coli) were isolated and identified, and some biological characteristics of these strains were observed. Lior's biotyping scheme was used for biotyping 354 strains of campylobacters(253 strains of C. jejuni and 2 strains of C. coli). The results showed the most biological characteristics of these campylobacters accorded with that previously described in the literatures, but it were also found that there were some differences on morphological, cultural, physiological and biochemical characteristics and antibiotic resistances. In these differences, the most main differences were that 48.3% (215/445) of C. jejuni and 23.1% (3/13) of C. coli were resistant to nalidixic acid, and that 1.1% (5/445) of C. jejuni and 7.6(1/13) of C. coli were resistant to cefotaxime. There were relationships between antibiotic resistances and strain sources (P < 0.005). The result of biotyping 352 strains of C. jejuni indicated that biotype I (40.9%) and II (58.2%) were predominant in the bodies of these animals, and there were two biotypes distributed in the body of same animal.
