Two cases of postoperative enterocolitis due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) after gastrectomy were experienced. Case 1: A 59-year-old male underwent subtotal gastrectomy for advanced gastric cancer. Diffuse peritonitis progressed after the first operation, so reoperation for drainage was required. Two days after the second operation, a profuse watery diarrhea developed. Case 2: A 46-year-old male underwent total gastrectomy for early gastric cancer. On the fourth postoperative day, frequent vomiting and cholera-like diarrhea started, followed by profound shock several hours later. Both cases were treated successfully by the administration of vancomycin. Stool cultures of both cases revealed MRSA and it had the same minimal inhibitory concentration, coagulase type and enterotoxin type, so that nosocomial infection was indicated.
