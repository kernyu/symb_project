Twenty strains of Pediococcus pentosaceus isolated from wine were examined for production of bacteriocins. Only two of them showed inhibitory activity, Ped. pentosaceus N4p against the indicator strains of the same species and N5p against 19 strains of the three genera of lactic acid bacteria from wine. The antimicrobial substance from N5p strains was removed by membrane (0.2 micron) filtration, destroyed by organic solvents and proteolytic enzymes. It was stable for 60 min at 100 degrees C. The bacteriocin was produced early in the growth cycle and its production was maximum after 48 h of culture in tomato juice medium at an initial pH of 6.5. The bactericidal effect was observed.
