Yeast fungemia has increased markedly in the last few years. Currently, Candida spp. is one of the microorganisms recovered most frequently from blood cultures. To better know the prevalence of yeast fungemia in our country we conducted a cross-sectional study with yeasts recovered from blood cultures obtained during a 3-month period from 39 hospitals in the Spanish public health hospital net. A total of 153 yeasts were recovered (59 were C. albicans, 53 C. parapsilosis, and 41 other species of yeasts). The percentage of males was 64.1. Mean age was 50.8 years. Factors associated with the appearance of fungemia were previous antibiotic therapy (83.7%), venous catheter (66%), previous bacterial infections (47.7%), and parenteral nutrition (40.5%). The recovery of C. albicans was independently associated with the admission to ICU, PDA and presence of urological/renal disease; C. parapsilosis was independently associated with the presence of hematological disease. The susceptibility studies of these strains recovered from blood cultures showed that in vitro resistance to amphotericin B and 5-fluorocytosine are practically nonexistent and that resistance to azole compounds is low. Multicentric epidemiologic studies are still necessary in this field of Microbiology.
