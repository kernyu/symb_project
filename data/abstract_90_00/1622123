Protein kinase C (PKC) is a Ca++- and phospholipid-dependent protein kinase that plays an important role in signal transduction pathways that regulate cell growth. Tumor cells selected for a multidrug resistant (MDR) phenotype often express elevated levels of PKC activity. To directly test whether PCK overexpression can produce an MDR phenotype, we studied rat embryo fibroblasts that were infected with the full-length cDNA clone RP58 encoding the beta I form of rat brain PKC. The PKC-beta I gene recipient R6-PKC3 cells are stable, overproduce PKC, and express an elevated level of PKC activity. R6-PKC3 cells exhibited significant resistance to adriamycin, actinomycin D, vinblastine, and vincristine but not to 5-fluorouracil. Intracellular accumulation of adriamycin, vinblastine, and vincristine was decreased in the R6-PKC3 cells, but this was not associated with an altered level of P-glycoprotein expression. Moreover, the reduction in drug accumulation appeared to be a consequence of a decreased rate of drug uptake. The data indicate that overexpression of PKC in rat fibroblasts produces an MDR phenotype without altering P-glycoprotein expression.
