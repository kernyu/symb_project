Beta-Lactam resistance in Staphylococcus aureus is associated with beta-lactamase production, with the presence of a new penicillin binding protein (PBP) called PBP2a, with reduced affinity for beta-lactam antibiotics, and with modifications of normal PBPs. We have studied these mechanisms of resistance, in vivo and in vitro, for several beta-lactam antibiotics against both beta-lactamase-producing and non-producing methicillin-resistant S. aureus organisms (MRSA). Our results showed that all tested agents inhibited binding of labeled penicillin G to many PBPs. The combination of cefoperazone and sulbactam was the best combination, and it inhibited radiolabeled penicillin G binding to PBP2a at a lower concentration than that needed for cefoperazone alone. In vivo, the regimen of cefoperazone plus sulbactam was also more effective than cefoperazone alone. For beta-lactamase-negative strains this correlated with an increased binding affinity of cefoperazone plus sulbactam to PBP2a and PBP4. The improved efficacy of cefoperazone plus sulbactam versus cefoperazone with a beta-lactamase producing strain was closely related to cefoperazone hydrolysis by beta-lactamase that was inhibited by sulbactam. This study demonstrates that there is more than one effect of beta-lactamase inhibitors when they are combined with beta-lactam antimicrobial agents, and also that there may be a role for these agents in therapy for MRSA infections.
