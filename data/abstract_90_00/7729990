The aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of 38 children from Surabaya, Indonesia, who suffered from chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) was studied using strict microbiological methodology. A total of 106 isolates (49 anaerobic and 57 aerobic) were recovered. Aerobic organisms alone were isolated from 11 (29%), anaerobic bacteria only in 4 (11%) and mixed aerobic and anaerobic flora were present in 23 (60%). The predominant organisms were Peptostreptococcus sp., Prevotella sp., Bacteroides sp., Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Fusobacterium sp. Thirty-nine beta-lactamase-producing bacteria were recovered from 22 (58%) patients. These findings demonstrate the role of penicillin resistant aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in the polymicrobial etiology of CSOM in children from Indonesia. Judicious use of antimicrobial therapy may prevent the development of antimicrobial resistance.
