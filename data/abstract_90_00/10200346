WSU-CLL is a de novo fludarabine resistant cell line established from a patient with advanced chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) refractory to chemotherapy including fludarabine (Flud). Our previous studies indicate that bryostatin 1 (Bryo 1) induces differentiation of WSU-CLL and increases the ratio of dCK/5'-NT activity and Bax/Bcl-2. This study tests the hypothesis that Bryo 1-differentiated cells are more susceptible to Flud than the parent WSU-CLL cells. Flud, given sequentially after Bryo 1, in vitro and in vivo animal studies resulted in significantly higher rates of growth inhibition and improved animal survival. Flud at 100 to 600 nM exhibited a dose-dependent growth inhibitory effect on the WSU-CLL cell line. The sequential exposure to Bryo 1 (10 nM for 72 h) followed by Flud (100 nM) resulted in significantly higher rates of growth inhibition than either the reverse addition of these two agents or each agent alone, but was not significantly different than the concurrent addition of Bryo 1 + Flud. Using 7-amino-actinomycin D staining and flow cytometry, apoptosis was seen in 40.8% of cells treated with Bryo 1 (10 nM, 72 h) followed by Flud, compared with Flud (100 nM, 72 h) followed by Bryo 1 (18.1%). To demonstrate that Bryo 1 enhancement of Flud efficacy was not restricted to in vitro culture, we used the WSU-CLL xenograft model in mice with severe combined immune deficiency (SCID). Bryo 1 + Flud at the maximum tolerated doses (75 microg/kg i.p. and 200 mg/kg i.v., respectively) were administered to mice in different combinations. The survival in days, the tumor growth inhibition ratio (T/C), the tumor growth delay (T-C) in days, log10 kill, as well as mean tumor weight (mtw) of mice treated with Bryo 1 followed by Flud, were significantly better than control and other groups. T/C%, T-C, log10 kill and mtw were as follows: Bryo 1 (36.8%, 10 days, 0.8, 375 mg); Flud (100%, 0. 0 day, 0.0, 1130 mg); Bryo 1 + Flud (14.3%, 12 days, 0.95, 288 mg); Bryo 1 followed by Flud (4.6%, 17 days, 1.35, 35 mg); Flud followed by Bryo (40.3%, 10 days, 0.80, 175 mg). We conclude that: i) Bryo 1 sensitizes WSU-CLL cells to Flud and enhances apoptosis; ii) the sequential treatment with Bryo 1 followed by Flud resulted in higher anti-tumor activity compared with either agent alone, in combination, or the reverse addition of these agents and iii) these results are comparable to those of Bryo 1 followed by 2-CdA suggesting common pathway(s) of interaction between Bryo 1 and purine analogues.
