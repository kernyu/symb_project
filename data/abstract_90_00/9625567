PURPOSE: To describe the manifestations of infectious crystalline keratopathy caused by Candida guilliermondii in a corneal transplant performed for pseudophakic bullous keratopathy. METHOD: Case report. RESULTS: Candida guilliermondii was identified as the causative organism of an indolent infectious crystalline keratopathy. Incisional lamellar biopsy provided diagnostic culture and histopathologic results. Histopathology showed aggregates of yeast elements between corneal stromal lamellae, without inflammation. The infection progressed despite a 6-week course of topical amphotericin B and an additional 6-week course of topical and oral fluconazole. Repeat penetrating keratoplasty resulted in clear graft, with no recurrent infection. CONCLUSIONS: Fungal keratopathy should be included in the differential diagnosis of infectious crystalline keratopathy. Numerous Candida species have been isolated in addition to the most common causative bacterial organism, Streptococcus viridans. Candida guilliermondii is yet one more causative agent of infectious crystalline keratopathy. Candida guilliermondii, a rare human pathogen, was resistant to medical therapy in this case.
