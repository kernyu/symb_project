Agar dilution was used to test the activities of HMR 3647, erythromycin A, azithromycin, clarithromycin, roxithromycin, clindamycin, and quinupristin-dalfopristin against 235 strains of Enterococcus faecalis. HMR 3647 was the most active compound (MICs at which 50 and 90% of the isolates are inhibited [MIC50 and MIC90, respectively] of 0.06 and 4.0 microg/ml, respectively). The MIC50 and MIC90 (with the MIC50 given first and the MIC90 given second; both in micrograms per milliliter) for other compounds were as follows: 4.0 and >32.0 for erythromycin A, 16.0 and >32.0 for azithromycin, 2.0 and >32 for clarithromycin, 32.0 and >32.0 for roxithromycin, 32.0 and >32.0 for clindamycin, and 8.0 and 16.0 for quinupristin-dalfopristin. All compounds were only bacteriostatic.
