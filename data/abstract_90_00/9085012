We report the evolution of the antimicrobial resistance of non-typhi Salmonella (1992-1994) in a Spanish hospital in relation with a case of infection due to a fluoroquinolone-resistant strain of Salmonella ser. Typhimurium. None of the isolates were resistant to ciprofloxacin. The resistance to ampicillin has increased from 20.6% (1992) to 29.5% (1994) whereas no significative differences in chloramphenicol and cotrimoxazole susceptibility were noted.
