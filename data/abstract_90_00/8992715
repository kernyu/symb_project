Opening of purulent foci in children with pyo-inflammatory diseases (PID) of soft tissues often leads to detection of staphylococcus aureus in the monoculture and different associations of this microbe with gram-negative bacteria in amounts exceeding the "critical level" responsible for the development of PID. Repeated examinations revealed a 2 times decreased frequency of detection of staphylococcus monocultures and 1.5 time less diversity of the association of microorganisms. Most efficient antiseptics among the investigated ones in relation to bacteria isolated in the opened purulent foci were found to be iodopyron, pervomur, boric acid, resorcinum, dioxidine.
