Gonorrhea is the most common reportable disease in the United States. In recent years, the epidemiology of this infection has changed as a result of increasing drug abuse, exchange of money and drugs for sex, and sexual promiscuity among teenagers, particularly blacks. Significant numbers of asymptomatic male carriers have been identified, which presents an additional challenge to disease control. Gonococcal infection has become increasingly resistant to traditional antibiotic therapy and now requires the use of newer, more expensive agents. Single-dose oral treatment with cefixime (Suprax) or a quinolone appears to be effective, safe, and practical for patients with uncomplicated gonorrhea. Serious infection and new syndromes caused by gonococci continue to be reported. Because disseminated infections can be fatal, hospitalization and treatment with intravenous antibiotics such as ceftriaxone sodium (Rocephin) or cefotaxime sodium (Claforan) are required.
