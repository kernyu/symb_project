We have isolated and characterized mutants which lack one or two of sixteen of the proteins of the Escherichia coli ribosome. The mutation responsible in each case mapped close to, and probably in, the corresponding gene. A conditional lethal phenotype and a variable degree of impairment in growth was observed. The missing protein was readily restored to the organelle if E coli or other eubacterial ribosomal proteins were added to a suspension of the mutant particles. The mutants have been used to investigate the role of individual proteins in ribosome function and assembly. They have also aided in the topographic pinpointing of proteins on the surface of the organelle.
