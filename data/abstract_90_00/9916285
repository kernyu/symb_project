In the study reported here, several disinfectants for surfaces, instruments, hands and mucous membrane were tested for their effectiveness against methicillin-resistant strains of S. aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococci. The results show that after use of the recommended concentrations with the recommended contact times, which were determined on the basis of the criteria for disinfectants according to the DGHM guideline for the testing and evaluation of chemical disinfection procedures, an adequate effect was able to be proved. Increased resistance of the methicillin-resistant S. aureus and vancomycin-resistant E. faecium strains to the tested disinfectants was not found. Only after use of diluted solutions differences in the bacterial count reductions were observed. In further studies it is to be investigated whether these differences are due to resistance to antibiotics or to intrinsic resistance.
