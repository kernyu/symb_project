Increased salicylic acid has been correlated with systemic acquired resistance in several plants. Inoculation of potato plants with the pathogen Phytophthora Infestans or inducers from the fungus, arachidonic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid also induce systemic acquired resistance in the plant. We now report that treatment of potato tuber slices with acetyl salicylic acid markedly reduces the resistant response of these tissues.
