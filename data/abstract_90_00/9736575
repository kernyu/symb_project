Of a total of 147 erythromycin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates, 64 (43.5%) were resistant to erythromycin, clindamycin, and streptogramin B (MLSB phenotype), 57 of which possessed the ermB gene. Eighty-two (55.8%) were resistant to erythromycin alone (M phenotype), 81 of which possessed the mefE gene. One was erythromycin and streptogramin B resistant but susceptible to clindamycin (MS phenotype) and possessed neither the erm gene nor the mefE gene.
