Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from surgical infections during the period from July 1982 to June 1995 were investigated in a multicenter study involving 19 hospitals in Japan, and the following results were obtained. 1. Though the isolation rate of P. aeruginosa was not high from primary infections, it was more frequently isolated from postoperative infections throughout the study period. Enterococcus spp., P. aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus including MRSA were predominant among postoperative infections. From the postoperative cases that had previous antibiotic treatment, Enterococcus spp., MRSA and P. aeruginosa were more predominantly isolated than from those without previous treatments with antibiotics. 2. Cefozopran, ceftazidime, cefsulodin, aztreonam, carumonam, gentamicin, amikacin and ofloxacin had strong activities against P. aeruginosa. We recognize recently that antibiotic-resistant strains of P. aeruginosa against imipenem and ofloxacin have been increasing year by year.
