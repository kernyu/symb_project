With the increasing drug resistance of Plasmodium falciparum especially to agents used for chemoprophylaxis, every precaution must be taken to protect travelers from contracting malaria. Prevention of mosquito bites is a fundamental goal that can be achieved by a variety of means including pyrethrinoid-impregnated bed nets, insecticide strips, liquid vaporizers, repellents, insecticide-impregnated garments, and air-conditioning. There are no contraindications for vector control. Chemoprophylaxis depends of individual criteria as determined by clinical and laboratory examinations and on travel conditions (destination, season, duration of stay, and local living conditions). Stand-by medication should be prescribed for self-treatment of fever in areas where medical care is not readily available. Chemoprophylaxis must be continued after the traveler returns and medical attention should be sought if symptoms occur. To ensure proper compliance with preventive measures, pre-travel counseling is a mandatory and integral part of prevention. Information provided to travelers must be clear, reliable, and up-to-date.
