The p53-regulated gene product p21 (sdi1,cip1,waf1) negatively regulates cell growth and has been suggested to be a potential tumour-suppressor gene. To determine the sites and types of mutations which inactivate the growth-arresting activity in sdi1 cDNA, plasmids containing sdi1 cDNA and the neomycin-resistant gene were irradiated with UV light and transfected into CHO cells. The UV irradiation increased number of the geneticin-resistant colonies which should have the UV-mutated sdi1 cDNA. Sdi1 mRNA was expressed in 23 out of 36 colonies (64%). In 13 sdi1 cDNA sequences analysed, mutations were found at codon 46 in nine cDNAs, and one each at codons 34, 54, 66 and 73. All the mutation sites are in the CDK-binding region. Ten mutations (77%) (codons 46 and 66) are C to T transition mutation at the dipyrimidine sequences, which is the major type of the UV-induced mutation.
