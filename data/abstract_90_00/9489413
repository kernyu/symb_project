The aim of the retrospective population-based study was to identify reasons for failure of sputum culture negativity from the 12th month on since the start of chemotherapy of pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB). Medical records of 97 patients with PTB (85 men and 12 women) remaining sputum culture positive for over 12 months, reported to the Central TB Registry (1988-1990), were reviewed. The mean age was 46.7 years. There were 39.2% blue collar workers, 18.6% peasants, 21.6% unemployed, 14.4% pensioners. Only 4.1% constituted persons with education above elementary level. 44 patients abused alcohol, 13 of them had severe alcohol related health problems. Initial susceptibility tests were done in 79 subjects, showing resistance to at least one drug in 15. In 21 subjects the new resistance occurred during observation. The mean period until conversion of sputum culture was 23.5 months. Sputum culture conversion was finally achieved in 63 (64.9%) subjects. The reasons for delayed sputum culture conversion were identified in 86 persons. The main reason for long duration of positive sputum culture in 75 (87.2%) subjects was poor compliance. In 7 (8.1%) cases evident treatment error was relevant. Serious adverse reactions to drugs were responsible in 4 (4.6%).
