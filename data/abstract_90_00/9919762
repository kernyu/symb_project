In the period from January 1993 to June 1996 were at the Department of Microbiology of the University Hospital in Olomouc 122 strains of Gram-negative nonfermentative rod-shaped bacteria isolated from haemocultures. The majority represented the group of 51 strains of the genus Acinetobacter (41.8%), complex A. calcoaceticus-baumannii (Acb complex). The second largest group were 21 strains (17.2%) of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. These were followed by 17 strains (13.9%) of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, 8 strains (6.6%) of non-Acb complex acinetobacters, 6 strains (4.9%) of Pseudomonas putida and 5 strains (4.1%) of Alcaligenes xylosoxidans. The remaining species were represented only by 1-2 strains. In three isolations was the identification impossible. The majority of strains (24.6%) were from the Department of Haematology of the University Hospital in Olomouc. The most frequent diagnoses in patients with positive haemocultures were leukemias and lymphomas (24.6%). The most effective tested antimicrobial agents were ceftazidime (93.4% of sensitive strains) and ofloxacin (91.7%). From the total number of 80 strains detected using the equipment BacT/Alert 120, 22 (27.5%) were isolated repeatedly confirming their role in the etiology of bacteriemic or septic episodes. Because only one blood sample was obtained in 34 cases (58.6%) of the remaining 58 only once detected strains, it was impossible to confirm their etiologic role by repeated isolation.
