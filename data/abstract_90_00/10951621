OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the role of Bcl-2 family proteins in hepatocytic apoptosis caused by ethanol. METHODS: We induced hepatocytic apoptosis in HepG(2) cells with ethanol and detected the apoptosis with TUNEL assay. Bcl-2, Bax, and Bak protein expression in the hepatocytes was determined by immunohistochemistry method. We also observed the expression of Bcl-2 protein in HepG(2) cells infected with Bcl-2 adenovirus vector and its protection against hepatocytic apoptosis caused by ethanol. RESULTS: No obvious cytotoxicity was noted in 0.2% and 1% ethanol treatment group, while it developed in 3% ethanol treatment group and accompanied by a marked expression of Bax, Bak proteins. CONCLUSION: The overexpression of Bax, Bak proteins may play a role in HepG(2) cell apoptosis induced by ethanol and can be blocked effectively by Bcl-2 adenovirus vector.
