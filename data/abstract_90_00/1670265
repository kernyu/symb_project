Mucor rouxii cells were used to examine the possible antimycotic activities of four substances: phenolamines, phenylendiamine and quinone. These substances are original structures recently synthesized. Assays in plates showed that 10(-2) M of phenolamines and phenylendiamines give rise to halos of growth inhibition. Assays in liquid media using 10(-4) M of substances showed 100% inhibition of spore germination. Specifically, the phenylendiamine showed 49% inhibition on development of mycelium. In these cells the calcofluor distribution changes, suggesting alterations in cell wall. No inhibition of growth was found using the quinone. The activity for substances were evaluated using standard antifungal benomyl. On this basis, the substance phenylendiamine it is an antimycotic active. The mechanism of action is not presently known.
