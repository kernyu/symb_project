An outbreak of Klebsiella bacteraemia at the Ethio-Swedish Childrens' Hospital, Addis Abeba, Ethiopia is described. The epidemic occurred between February 1988 and February 1990 and appeared to originate in the neonatal nursery and subsequently spread to involve other wards in the hospital. Resistance to several antibiotics, including gentamicin, was common. The importance of effective surveillance and the early institution of control measures for the prevention of nosocomial infection are discussed.
