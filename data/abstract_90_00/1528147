Acyclovir has become the drug of choice for prevention of visceral dissemination of Varicella-zoster virus infections in immunocompromised individuals. This article describes a 6-year-old girl taking cytotoxic therapy and radiotherapy for treatment of Hodgkin lymphoma who developed cutaneous varicella infection. Despite the early administration of acyclovir a fatal varicella pneumonia occurred and she died on the 4th day of hospitalization. Since the resistance is inducible, the increase of unresponsiveness to acyclovir in immunocompromised hosts with varicella infection is a potential risk that can cause to increase in fatalities in these patients.
