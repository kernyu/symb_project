In a multicentre study 163 women with acute lower urinary tract infection were treated orally with either 125 mg cefuroxime axetil or 100 mg ofloxacin twice daily for three days. Both antimicrobial agents were generally well tolerated. Four patients in the group treated with cefuroxime axetil and two in the group treated with ofloxacin experienced adverse events. Clinical cure and improvement were registered in 56 of 66 (84.8%) and 59 of 62 (95.2%) of the evaluable patients treated with cefuroxime axetil and ofloxacin, respectively. Seven to nine days after therapy, bacteriuria (CFU < 10(3)/ml) had been eliminated in 53 of 66 (80.3%) and 57 of 64 (89.1%) of the evaluable patients receiving cefuroxime axetil and ofloxacin, respectively. The results were not statistically significantly different (p > 0.1). Pathogens present at baseline were eliminated by up to an MIC of 16 mg/l of cefuroxime axetil, independent of susceptibility to this agent. There was no difference with regard to efficacy and tolerance between patients treated with cefuroxime axetil and those treated with ofloxacin. On the basis of the MICs of six antimicrobial agents (cefuroxime, ofloxacin, cefadroxil, ampicillin, trimethoprim with and without sulfamethoxazole) determined for the pathogens isolated prior to therapy, resistance rates were lowest for cefuroxime (2.2%) and ofloxacin (3.4%).
