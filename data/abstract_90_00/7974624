The relationship between gentamicin pharmacokinetics and measures of bioelectrical impedance (BI) in elderly patients was investigated with the aim of developing a potential noninvasive means of individualising gentamicin dosage. Linear regression analyses identified height/resistance2 as a statistically significant predictor of gentamicin distribution volume, V, [adjusted (adj)r2 = 0.53, coefficient of variation (CV) = 15.2%], and resistance/reactance and creatinine clearance (CLcr) as predictors of total systemic clearance, CL, adj r2 = 0.52, CV = 20.1%. Individualisation of gentamicin dosage regimens based on these relationships to achieve steady-state (SS), peak gentamicin concentrations, Css,max, and SS trough concentrations, Css,min, of 7.0 and 1.0 micrograms/ml, respectively, in an independent group of elderly patients resulted in serum gentamicin levels of 5.9 +/- 0.7 and 0.8 +/- 0.4 micrograms/ml. Mean absolute prediction errors averaged 0.7 +/- 0.5 micrograms/ml for Css,max and 0.5 +/- 0.3 micrograms/ml for Css,min. Measures of BI provided the best predictions of Css,max, whereas models based on CLcr alone were the best predictors of Css,min. This technique provides a means of complementing routine pharmacokinetic monitoring of gentamicin pharmacotherapy in the elderly hospitalised patient with reductions in patient discomfort and potential savings in time and cost.
