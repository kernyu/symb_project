The authors analyzed the course of 100 cycles of chemotherapy administered on account of haematological oncological disease: 66 cycles with administration of selective decontamination and 34 without its administration. Based on an analysis of the gut flora they provided evidence of the necessity of concurrent administration of originally separately administered antibiotics and of the necessity to replace nystatin by amphotericin B. They found a significant reduction of the incidence of infectious complications, the number of days with a body temperature above 38 and reduced consumption of antibiotics. The authors found a different composition of the agents causing infectious complications--a reduction of the ratio of Gram-negative agents and an increase of Gram-positive agents and fungi and also in increased percentage of fever of unknown origin. By analysis of the sensitivity of the detected microbes to antibiotics the authors assessed changes in the resistance caused by administration of selective decontamination and assessed the order of assumed effectiveness of the tested antibiotics.
