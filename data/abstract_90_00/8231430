The authors have compared susceptibility of bacteria isolated from various clinical material in 1989-1991 to ofloxacin. Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Proteus, Klebsiella, and Enterobacter were frequently susceptible to the antibiotic, the percentage of resistant strains being less than 10-20%. A higher percentage of resistance was noted for Pseudomonas aeruginosa--approx. 40%. A gradual increase in resistance to ofloxacin among Streptococcus faecalis, Serratia and Acinetobacter strains was observed.
