Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are very common in medical practice. Women have a high prevalence of UTIs, approximately 50 times higher than men. A large proportion of this prevalence is probably caused by anatomic and physical factors Chemical analysis of urine composition, examination of the urinary sediment and the bacterial colony counts are of great value for diagnosis and therapy. The patients may be benefit from antibiotic doses. In addition to trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMZ), amoxicillin and cephalosporins, the authors observed a new drug: fluoroquinolones. These drugs derived by nalidixic acid and included: ciprofloxacin, enoxacin, lomefloxacin, norfloxacin, pefloxacin and rufloxacin. They are sinergistic against most Gram positives and negatives including Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis. Fluoroquinolone is an antibacterial agent that is effective in treating urinary tract infections. It is usually administered orally and is well absorbed after oral ingestion. Quinolones are preferable to TMP/SMZ because of their greater antibacterial activity that occurred in about 82% of women. A dose of quinolones (400 mg daily for 3 days) has been particularly effective in the treatment of UTIs. The amoxicillin-clavulanic acid can be used for treatment even if increased antibiotic resistance. The efficacy, relative safety and low cost of quinolones predispose to utilize its like the first treatment choice.
