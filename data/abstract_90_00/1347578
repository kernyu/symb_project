In recent years, the antiviral armamentarium has expanded considerably. Currently available agents are virustatic, inhibiting specific steps in the process of viral replication. No agent is active against nonreplicating or latent viruses. Acyclovir is useful in the treatment of genital herpes, herpes simplex encephalitis, mucocutaneous herpetic infection, varicella infection in the immunosuppressed host, and herpes zoster infection in the normal and the immunosuppressed host. It can also be used for prevention of herpesvirus infection in immunocompromised patients. Ganciclovir is indicated for the treatment of cytomegalovirus retinitis in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and is effective in the management of organ-specific cytomegalovirus infection in other immunocompromised patients. Chronic hepatitis C and condyloma acuminatum due to human papillomavirus respond to therapy with interferon alfa-2b. Patients with human immunodeficiency virus infection and CD4 lymphocyte counts of less than 500 cells/mm3 should be treated with zidovudine. Amantadine is useful in a therapeutic and prophylactic role in the management of influenza A virus infection. With the expanded use of and indications for antiviral therapy, clinically significant resistance to these agents has been encountered with increasing frequency.
