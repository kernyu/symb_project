Despite the remarkable resistance to desiccation, Bacillus subtilis spores manifest indications of DNA damage when being kept in an extremely dry environment made by high vacuum. Spores of strain TKJ3422 (uvrA10 spl-1 recA4) with triple repair defects lost colony-forming capacity dependent on the duration and strength of the exposure. Mutations to rifampicin resistance were induced in the spores of the strain HA101 with wild-type repair capability and the strain TKJ6312 (uvrA10 spl-1) with double repair defects. The majority of nalidixic acid-resistant mutations induced by the exposure to high vacuum belonged to one particular allele gyrA12 carrying a tandem-base change, 5'-CA to 5'-TT, at codon 84 of the gyrA gene coding for DNA gyrase subunit A. This allele has never been found among more than 500 mutants obtained by various treatments other than vacuum exposure. These results indicate forced dehydration of DNA in the microenvironment of the spore core causes unique damage leading to lethal and mutagenic consequences.
