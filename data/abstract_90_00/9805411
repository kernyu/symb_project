Data on cholera cases admitted to the Delhi Infectious Diseases Hospital (IDH) are presented to describe the pattern of occurrence of cholera in Delhi in 1995. Rectal swabs from 4082 cases of acute diarrhoea admitted to the IDH were examined for excretion of Vibrio cholerae. Of them, 2004(49%) and 4(0.1%) were positive for V. cholerae O1 biotype El Tor and V. cholerae O139 respectively. Most cholera cases occurred during May-September (summer and monsoon months). The period from January to March (winter) was completely free from cholera. The urban areas were not affected uniformly. Of the 80 PIN (Postal Index Number) code areas, 10 contributed to 57% of the cases. The early cases were scattered in PIN code areas distant from one another. The hospitalisation rates for cholera were the highest in children aged less than five years and declined significantly with increasing patients' age. Males had significantly higher rates than females aged up to 20 years, whereas the situation was reversed in the 20 to 39 year age group. Four per cent of the affected families had multiple cases. An estimated 1% of the household contacts of hospitalised cases of cholera were themselves hospitalised for cholera within 2 days of the first admission. Of the 260 V. cholerae O1 isolates tested, 4%, 7%, 8%, 89%, 91% and 95% were resistant to tetracycline, nalidixic acid, chloramphenicol, co-trimoxazole, streptomycin, and furazolidone respectively. The study highlights the usefulness of surveillance data to identify groups, urban areas and seasons with increased risk for cholera and to allow control measures to be focussed on those in greatest need.
