In 1979, in view of the widespread resistance of Plasmodium falciparum to chloroquine in the island of Hainan, China, it use as an antimalarial was suspended throughout the island. A longitudinal survey of the chloroquine-sensitivity of P. falciparum was carried out over the period 1981-91 to investigate whether its resistance had changed from the 1979 level. In-vitro assays were carried out every 2-3 years, while in-vivo tests were performed annually over the period 1981-83 and also in 1991. Resistance to chloroquine declined progressively after its use had stopped. The in-vitro tests indicated that the rate of chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum was 97.9% in 1981, but dropped to 60.9% in 1991 (P < 0.001). The mean concentration of chloroquine for complete inhibition of schizont formation was 10.4 pmol/microliters in 1981, but decreased to 3.0 pmol/microliters in 1991 (P < 0.001). The proportion of samples taken from malaria cases that required high concentrations ( > 6.4 pmol/microliters) of chloroquine for complete inhibition of schizont formation was 83.3% in 1981, but only 17.4% in 1991 (P < 0.001); at low concentrations ( > 1.6 pmol/microliters), the corresponding proportions increased from 4.2% in 1981 to 60.8% in 1991 (P < 0.001). In the 4-week in-vivo test, the rate of chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum decreased from 84.2% in 1981 to 40% in 1991 (P < 0.001). RII + RIII cases represented 59.4% of the total resistant cases in 1981, but decreased to 37.5% in 1991 (0.02 > P > 0.01).
