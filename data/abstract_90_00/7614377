Neurospora crassa was susceptible to azole drugs: ketoconazole (MIC 1 microgram/ml), fluconazole (MIC 5 micrograms/ml), and SCH39304 (MIC 5 micrograms/ml). Mutants of N. crassa resistant to ketoconazole were selected and genetically characterized. The seven characterized resistance mutations represented at least four genetic loci. Some mutants, but not all, were also resistant to fluconazole and to SCH39304.
