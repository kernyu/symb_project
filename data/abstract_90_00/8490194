Seven adult patients with refractory acute leukemia were administered trimetrexate (TMTX), a non-classical folate antagonist, in a phase I trial. TMTX was administered as an intravenous bolus for five consecutive days at doses of 9-12 mg/m2 based on marrow response. The maximum tolerated dose was 12 mg/m2. Hepatotoxicity was the dose-limiting toxicity. Initial dosage reductions in patients with liver disease and/or low protein concentrations may be necessary since TMTX is significantly protein bound and cleared primarily by hepatic metabolism. The recommended phase II dose on this dosing schedule is 9 mg/m2.
