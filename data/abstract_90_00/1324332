Gram-positive organisms such as Staphylococcus aureus (including MRSA), coagulase-negative staphylococci, Enterococcus spp., and Streptococcus spp. have in recent years emerged as significant pathogens in hospitals and are now being isolated more frequently than gram-negative bacilli. These organisms are often multidrug resistant. Therefore, alternative agents with potent activity against gram-positive organisms are of considerable interest. In addition to the glycopeptide antibiotic vancomycin and the aminoglycoside antibiotic arbekacin, which can be used in MRSA infections, teicoplanin, RP 59500 and daptomycin are now under basic research in Japan. These antimicrobial agents are very active against gram-positive organisms, including MRSA and appear to be potent agents against infections due to gram-positive cocci, particularly MRSA.
