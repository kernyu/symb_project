The in vitro susceptibility of 41 strains of "Campylobacter upsaliensis" to 24 antimicrobial agents was determined using a broth microdilution procedure. Most isolates were susceptible to the fluoroquinolones and beta-lactam antibiotics tested, but all strains were resistant to trimethoprim (MBCs greater than or equal to 128 micrograms/ml) and teicoplanin (MBCs greater than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml). These agents may be useful in a selective isolation medium for "Campylobacter upsaliensis".
