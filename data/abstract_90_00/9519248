The effect of acutely applied ethanol and the impact of chronic ethanol treatment, sufficient to induce tolerance and physical dependence, on N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor function were studied in acutely isolated neurons from the medial septum/diagonal band (MS/DB) of adult rats using whole cell, patch-clamp electrophysiology. There was a small positive correlation for capacitance and current amplitude activated by 100 microM NMDA for all groups. Also, cell membrane capacitance was significantly smaller for Ethanol Dependent (approximately 80-84%) than either Naive or Control cells. Therefore NMDA-activated responses were normalized for capacitance (current density, pA/pF) across all three groups. NMDA-activated (30-1000 microM) responses were significantly larger in cells from Control and Ethanol Dependent rats relative to those from Naives. In addition, estimated maximal responses were significantly larger for Ethanol Dependent cells, compared to either Control or Naive, respectively, while EC50s and slopes were not significantly different. Acute 60 mM ethanol significantly inhibited responses to 100 microM NMDA in all three groups, however, mean ethanol inhibition was 12-25% smaller after ethanol dependence. There was no evidence of acute tolerance to ethanol inhibition for any group, but examination of patterns of inhibition for individual neurons showed a few cells were resistant to ethanol or exhibited progressive loss of ethanol inhibition. These results suggest that NMDA receptor function in acutely isolated MS/DB neurons is increased following in vivo chronic ethanol treatment, and shows resistance to acute ethanol inhibition suggesting NMDA receptor-mediated cellular tolerance.
