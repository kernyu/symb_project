Expression of a high level of F-plasmid-encoded SopB protein in Escherichia coli is found to repress genes linked to sopC, a sequence element of F consisting of 12 tandemly joined imperfect repeats of a 43-bp motif. Repression of a gene can occur over a distance of at least 10 kb from the sopC element and is not affected by the relative orientation of sopC. In the repressed state, accessibility of intracellular DNA to cellular proteins is greatly reduced in the region containing sopC, as monitored by the trapping of the covalent intermediate between DNA and DNA gyrase and by Dam methylase-catalyzed DNA methylation. These results signify the formation of a nucleoprotein structure emanating from sopC and are discussed in terms of position-dependent silencing of genes in general and the IncG type of plasmid incompatibility in particular.
