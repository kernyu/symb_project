Many different genetic strategies have been proposed to engineer plant resistance to bacterial diseases, including producing antibacterial proteins of non-plant origin, inhibiting bacterial pathogenicity or virulence factors, enhancing natural plant defenses and artificially inducing programmed cell death at the site of infection. These are based on our knowledge of the mechanisms of action of antibacterial compounds and of the successive steps in plant-bacterial interactions. This article presents the different approaches and demonstrates that, even though several of these ideas have already been applied, no commercial applications have yet been achieved.
