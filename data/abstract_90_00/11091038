The susceptibility of 100 Salmonella enterica strains belonging to S. enterica subsp. enterica (n=90) and S. enterica subsp. arizonae (n=10) was examined to 71 antibiotics. Within S. enterica subsp. enterica, strains of different serovars (typhimurium (n=17), enteritidis (n=17), dublin (n=10), typhi (n=16), paratyphi A (n=6), others (n=24)) were studied. MICs were determined using a microdilution procedure and apart from fosfomycin there were no significant differences in susceptibility between the subspecies and serovars of S. enterica. All salmonellae were sensitive or intermediately resistant to tetracyclines, aminoglycosides, most beta-lactam antibiotics, quinolones, co-trimoxazole group antibiotics, chloramphenicol, nitrofurantoin and azithromycin. S. enterica strains were intrinsically resistant to benzylpenicillin, oxacillin, most macrolides, rifampicin, lincosamides, streptogramins, glycopeptides and fusidic acid. Apart from some slight differences in antibiotic susceptibility between strains of S. enterica subsp. enterica and S. enterica subsp. arizonae, only the susceptibility to fosfomycin varied among the taxa studied. Whereas 'enteric' salmonellae including S. enterica subsp. arizonae were sensitive to fosfomycin, 'typhoid' salmonellae were intrinsically resistant. A database of the antibiotic susceptibility of S. enterica was set up. It may be of use to validate antibiotic susceptibility test results of these bacteria.
