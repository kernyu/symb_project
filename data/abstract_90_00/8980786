A DNA clone from Rhodococcus equi conferring low-level rifampin resistance through the ability to inactivate this antibiotic via its decomposition was identified. The iri (inactivation of rifampin) gene consisted of an open reading frame of 1,437 bp encoding a 479-amino-acid sequence strongly resembling those of monooxygenases acting upon phenolic compounds or involved in polyketide antibiotic synthesis. When expressed in Escherichia coli, the gene conferred resistance to a > 50-micrograms/ml concentration of the drug.
