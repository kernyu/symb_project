Twelve ceftazidime-resistant isolates of the family Enterobacteriaceae (11 Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates and 1 Escherichia coli isolate) were collected in 1995 from three Polish hospitals located in different cities. All were identified as producers of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs). Detailed analysis of their beta-lactamase contents revealed that six of them expressed SHV-5-like ESBLs. The remaining six were found to produce three different TEM enzymes, each characterized by a pI value of 6.0 and specified by new combinations of amino acid substitutions. The amino acid substitutions compared to the TEM-1 beta-lactamase sequence were Gly238Ser, Glu240Lys, and Thr265Met for TEM-47; Leu21Phe, Gly238Ser, Glu240Lys, and Thr265Met for TEM-48; and Leu21Phe, Gly238Ser, Glu240Lys, Thr265Met, and Ser268Gly for TEM-49. The new TEM beta-lactamases, TEM-47, TEM-48, and TEM-49, belong to a subfamily of TEM-2-related enzymes. Genes coding for TEM-47 and TEM-49 could have originated from the TEM-48-encoding sequence by various single genetic events. The new TEM derivatives probably document the already advanced microevolution of ESBLs ongoing in Polish hospitals, in a majority of which no monitoring of ESBL producers was performed before 1996.
