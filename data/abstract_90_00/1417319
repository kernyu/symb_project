A micromethod based on the use of plates with wells and microquantities of microbial suspensions is described. It provides determination of MICs of antibacterial drugs and sensitivity of clinical strains of anaerobes of 2 or 3 species predominating in pathological materials as well as to preliminarily identify some anaerobic bacteria by their antibiotic sensitivity.
