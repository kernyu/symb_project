In this study, the reactivity of three different monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against the multiple-drug resistance (MDR)-related P-glycoprotein (P-170) were compared with each other using a collection of frozen and paraffin-embedded tumors, normal tissues and metastatic cells of malignant pleural and peritoneal effusions. The MAbs JSB-1, C 219 and 265/F4 were used in an indirect immunoperoxidase technique on frozen material. In addition, MAb C 219 was used on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded material from the same tumors, of which frozen sections were studied, and in a retrospective study C 219 was tested on paraffin blocks of the primary tumors that were responsible for the malignant effusions. The results show different staining patterns for all three MAbs to some extent. Results in frozen and paraffin sections obtained with MAb C 219 were comparable. MAb C 219 performs well both in frozen and formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded material, making it a useful candidate for application in routine laboratory analysis. The retrospective analysis did not show consistency of P-170 expression in the same patients. This leads to the hypothesis that the actual status of P-170 expression in recurrent disease should be obtained before continuing or modifying chemotherapy. Clinical studies aimed at the correlation of immunohistochemistry with therapy response have to evaluate the relevance of P-170 expression in drug resistance of primary and metastatic tumors.
