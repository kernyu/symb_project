A simplified Plasmodium falciparum in vivo test was carried out in Brazzaville (Congo) in April 1996. Chloroquine was prescribed at 25 mg/kg for 3 days in asymptomatic Brazzavillian school children who presented parasitemia > 800 P. falciparum trophozoites and lived in a highly endemic district. A massive decrease of parasitemia was observed on day 2. The percentage of resistance (presence of P. falciparum trophozoite on day 7 in a thick blood film) was 43.5, 28 and 21 respectively (IC: 95%: 29-57, 15-41 & 10-34) at the threshold of 6, 50 and 100 parasites/microliter. In positive children on day 7 the reduction of parasitemia was > 95% and no case of R3 resistance was detected. A comparison with previous studies carried out in 1985, 1986, 1990 and 1993 in the same school using the same methodology proves the long-lasting stabilization of chloroquino-resistance for this semi-immune indigenous population.
