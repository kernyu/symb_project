The paper deals with a role of the factors of the body's antiinfective resistance system in the pathogenesis of chronic bacterial prostatitis and with the identification of an etiological factor of the disease. Long-term studies have revealed that chronic bacterial prostatitis runs in the presence of impairments in the antiinfective resistance system, in failures of T lymphocytes, phagocytic activity, and opsonization in particular. Gram-positive cocci, predominantly Staphylococcus and Enterococcus alone or as part of 2-component associations have been found to be the leading agents in the etiology of chronic bacterial prostatitis.
