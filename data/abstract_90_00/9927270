We evaluated vancomycin use in a hospital with endemic vancomycin-resistant enterococci and a vancomycin restriction program. Only 68% of vancomycin was prescribed appropriately. Inappropriate use was due primarily to empirical therapy. In the patients with a microbiological diagnosis following empirical therapy, 83% (25/30) had infections due to bacteria sensitive to an appropriate antibiotic other than vancomycin. However, only 60% (15/25) of these patients had their vancomycin orders changed.
