Although chemotherapy has been documented to be effective in the treatment of Helicobacter pylori-associated gastritis and gastroduodenal ulcers, some cases are known to have been unsuccessful in the attempt to eradicate this species. In this study, we examined the relation between the susceptibility of H. pylori isolates and the efficacy of chemotherapy. We utilized the modified agar plate dilution method to determine the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 63 H. pylori strains isolated before treatment with several drugs routinely used during eradication chemotherapy. Among the drugs tested, amoxicillin (AMPC) and clarithromycin (CAM) demonstrated high degrees of activity with MIC99, 0.39 and 0.2 micrograms/ml, respectively. No highly resistant strain against AMPC was detected among the strains examined, while for CAM and metronidazole (MTZ), 9.5% and 7.9% of the strains, respectively, were resistant before treatment. It should be noted that all of the MICs of the strains from patients with successful therapy were lower than those from patients with unsuccessful therapy. These findings indicate that susceptibility tests should be carried out prior to the commencement of drug administration in order to provide safer and more effective chemotherapy.
