Outer membrane protein (OMP) profiles of 122 Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates recovered from the blood of bacteremic patients were analyzed to relate alterations in the expression of OMPs with porin activity to resistance to imipenem, ceftazidime, and ciprofloxacin. Imipenem-resistant isolates lacked or expressed reduced amounts of porin OprD. In contrast, alterations of OMP profiles were absent in most ceftazidime-resistant isolates. Six of 12 ciprofloxacin-resistant isolates had normal OMP profiles. The remaining isolates showed alterations in the expression of either OprC, OprF, or OprD. In addition, imipenem- and ceftazidime-resistant isolates displayed a beta-lactamase activity compatible with that of a group 1 chromosomal cephalosporinase.
