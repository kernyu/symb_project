The activity of cefoperazone/sulbactam was compared with eleven other antimicrobial agents against 91 strains of the Bacteroides fragilis group known to be resistant to clindamycin and/or beta-lactam agents. Sulbactam alone possessed moderate activity against most strains and improved the activity of cefoperazone and ampicillin. Bacteroides distasonis strains were more resistant than other species. There was no correlation between resistance of an isolate to either clindamycin or cefoxitin with resistance to cefoperazone/sulbactam.
