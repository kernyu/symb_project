The in vitro activity of trovafloxacin against 125 strains of Mycoplasma species and Ureaplasma urealyticum, including fluoroquinolone-susceptible and fluoroquinolone-resistant species, was compared to those of other fluoroquinolones, doxycycline, and erythromycin. The MIC at which 90% of isolates are inhibited for all fluoroquinolone-susceptible strains was 0.25 microg/ml. Whatever the associated mutations, trovafloxacin exhibited greater activity than the other fluoroquinolones tested against fluoroquinolone-resistant Mycoplasma hominis and U. urealyticum isolates.
