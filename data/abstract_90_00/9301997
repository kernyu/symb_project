Fifty-four of 59 (91.5%) clarithromycin-resistant isolates of Helicobacter pylori from different patients possessed either the A2143G (formerly A2058G) or the A2144G (formerly A2059G) mutation in the gene encoding 23S rRNA. The A2143G mutation was significantly more likely to occur in isolates with MICs exceeding 64 mg/L (65% versus 30% with the A2144G mutation; P = 0.01). The majority (26 of 31; 83.9%) of isolates with the A2143G mutation had MICs exceeding 64 mg/L. Peptic ulcer disease recurred in a substantial proportion of patients infected with H. pylori strains containing either the A2143G or the A2144G mutation.
