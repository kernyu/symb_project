From January 1978 to August 1990, Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia (SAB) were identified in 31 patients with hematological malignancies at Jichi Medical School hospital. Mortality due to SAB was 48.4% (15/31). Of the variables analyzed, four factors were significantly associated with a poor prognosis; elderly age (p = 0.015), high granulocyte count (more than 500/microliters) (p = 0.015), presence of DIC (p = 0.011) and presence of pneumonia (p = 0.023). The incidence of methicillin-resistant SAB was 32.3% (10/31) and the first patient developed in 1985. Although not statistically significant, there was a trend of higher mortality for methicillin-resistant SAB (70%) than for methicillin-sensitive SAB (38.1%). Most strains of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus were sensitive to minocycline, chloramphenicol and vancomycin.
