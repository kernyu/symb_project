The results obtained in the study of antibiotic and sulfamide sensitivity of 197 Neisseria meningitidis strains of groups A, B and C, isolated from the spinal fluid and blood of patients with meningococcal infection hospitalized in the 2nd Clinico-Infectious Hospital, Moscow, in 1984-1989 and studied with the use of the disc diffusion method and the method of serial dilutions of antibiotics in solid culture media, are presented. As revealed in this study, N. meningitidis strains retained their high sensitivity to penicillin and ampicillin (MIC50 = 0.016 and 0.032 micrograms/ml respectively). Sensitivity to tetracycline decreased (MIC50 = 0.5 micrograms/ml) and to rifampicin increased (MIC50 = 0.063 micrograms/ml). 48.5% of strains were resistant to streptomycin. In recent years the proportion of N. meningitidis, resistant to sulfanilamide preparations, significantly decreased and MIC50 was equal to 2.5 micrograms/ml in comparison with 5-10 micrograms/ml in the preceding period. The results of testing sensitivity to antibiotics by both methods coincided. Still the disc diffusion method can be used in epidemiological surveillance on meningococcal infection, while for more exact differentiation of N. meningitidis strains the use of the method of serial dilutions is necessary.
