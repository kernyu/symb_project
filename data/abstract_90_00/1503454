A beta-lactam-resistant serotype 23F Streptococcus pneumoniae clinical isolate from the cerebrospinal fluid of a pediatric patient from California is unusual in that the MICs of cefotaxime and ceftriaxone (2.5 micrograms/ml each) are higher than that of benzylpenicillin (0.3 micrograms/ml); the isolate also has patterns of penicillin-binding proteins and of cell wall peptides which are atypical compared with those of previously examined penicillin-resistant pneumococci.
