Swine production systems are characterised by a high diversity with regard to management type and the level of intensity of management. The number of helminth species and their infection levels are strongly influenced by the different systems. The present paper focuses on the situation in northern Europe, with examples from Denmark, and describes a decrease in both the number of helminth species and in their infection levels as a result of a shift from non-intensive to highly intensive production systems. Differences in the basic biological requirements of the pre-infective larvae, and in the transmission characteristics and immunogenicity of the various helminth species, explain why some species are more vulnerable to manage mental changes than others. Finally, control measures for the different production systems are discussed. Even though it is well documented that proper hygiene and management may prevent transmission of helminths, use of anthelmintics is still the single most important action taken by pig farmers to control worm infections. It is emphasised that anthelmintics should not be used uncritically, but should be integrated with management practices and the production system to achieve optimum effect and to avoid development of anthelmintic resistance.
