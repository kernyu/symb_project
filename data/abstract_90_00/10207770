The Alexander Project is a continuing, international, multicenter, longitudinal study of the antimicrobial susceptibility of pathogens commonly associated with community-acquired lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI). The study began in 1992 to provide high-quality surveillance data, comparable between regions and through time. As antimicrobial resistance becomes more prevalent, reliable surveillance data are required for clinical decision-making. Accurate current susceptibility data are required to predict clinical success through the determination of pharmacodynamic breakpoints. The Alexander Project provides the information required for clinicians to improve the likelihood of microbiological and clinical cure in the antibiotic treatment of LRTI.
