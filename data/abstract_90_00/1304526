25 human placentae lobuli obtained from normal, term deliveries were examined. Two-sided, closed perfusion according to modified Schneider method was used. Pressure of perfusion was recorded independently in maternal and fetal circulation using mercurial manometer and Ludwig kymograph++. Ethyl alcohol was dosed in single portion of 50 mg (A-1 group) and 250 mg (A-2 group) in 10% concentration (real concentration respectively 0.1 and 0.5%). In control group 0.9% NaCl was used. Decrease of the blood-vessel resistance in maternal and fetal circulation was observed. The relaxation was dependent on ethyl alcohol concentration.
