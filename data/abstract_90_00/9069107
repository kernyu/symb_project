A review of efflux as a mechanism of antibiotic resistance in both bacterial and eukaryotic cells is presented. This covers membrane transport, the evolution of efflux transporters, their genetic control and classification into families, and an appreciation of the widespread distribution and occurrence of these mechanisms in nature.
