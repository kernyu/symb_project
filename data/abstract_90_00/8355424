This paper describes an improved method for solubilizing nystatin in an aqueous solution without the aid of organic solvents. The patch pipette was filled with a solution of nystatin and fluorescein sodium mixed in a molar ratio of 1:10. The success rate of perforated patch recordings was substantially improved, and the access resistance of 20-40 M omega was readily achieved.
