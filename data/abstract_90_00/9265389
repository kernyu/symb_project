This study reports pheno- and genotypical analysis of 9 isolates of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) and 5 vancomycin-sensitive enterococci (VSE) in Austria: 5 E, faecium isolates of 4 patients (the sole patients demonstrating VRE at the University Hospital of Innsbruck in 1994 and 1995), 3 glycopeptide-sensitive isolates collected in Innsbruck in February 1996 for epidemiological analysis, and 6 enterococcus isolates from the University Hospitals of Vienna and Graz. The pheno- and genotypical analyses of all glycopeptide highly resistant E. faecium and E. faecalis isolates indicated the presence of VanA type resistance. One E. casseliflavus strain with intrinsic VanC-1 resistance showed a characteristic constitutive low-level resistance to vancomycin and susceptibility to teicoplanin. Genotyping with macro-restriction analysis demonstrated that 3 VRE isolates of the 5 E. faecium specimens were identical; the same applied to 2 VSE isolates. The two patients with VRE had been cared for at the same time in a surgical ICU and likewise, the two patients with VSE were simultaneously treated at a neurological ICU. The genotyping of E. faecalis strains showed that two strains of the three VRE isolates exhibited identical patterns. Epidemiological investigation did not reveal a mode of transmission for this cluster. Two of the 8 patients with VRE died within 60 days after isolation of the bacteria; the doctors in charge did not consider that the enterococci had been the cause of death. The results of our study indicate that oral vancomycin administration to humans is a primary cause of VRE in Austrian hospitals. In Austria approximately 66 kg vancomycin, 20% of it given orally, are administered to patients per year. Approx. 18-20 tons Avotan (active ingredient Avoparcin-10%)/year were used in Austria; as of April 1, 1997 the use of this animal foodstuff supplement is prohibited by the European Commission.
