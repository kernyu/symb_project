Varicella-zoster virus (human herpesvirus 3; VZV) is one of eight herpes viruses that routinely infect humans. It is classified as a member of the genus Varicellovirus, subfamily Alphaherpesvirinae, family Herpesviridae. Of the other human herpes viruses it is most closely related to the herpes simplex viruses (also members of the Alphalerpesvirinae). Like all herpes viruses, the virus has a large double-stranded DNA genome within an icosahedral nucleocapsid. This is surrounded by a proteinaceous tegument and a trilaminar membrane derived from host-cell membranes into which the viral glycoproteins are inserted. The structure of the virion is summarized in Fig. 1.
