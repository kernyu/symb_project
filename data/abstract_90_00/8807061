Resistance to clarithromycin among isolates of Mycobacterium chelonae and M. abscessus was observed in 18 of 800 (2.3%) patients tested between 1990 and 1995. Patients whose isolates were resistant had either disseminated disease or chronic lung disease, and the resistant isolates were recovered after clarithromycin monotherapy. Sequencing of the gene coding for the 23S rRNA peptidyltransferase region revealed a point mutation involving adenine at position 2058 (38%) or adenine at position 2059 (62%) in 20 of 20 relapse isolates from the first 13 patients identified. By pulsed-field gel electrophoresis or random amplified polymorphic DNA PCR, initial and relapse isolates were shown to have identical DNA patterns. M. chelonae and M. abscessus isolates were found to have only a single chromosomal copy of the rRNA operon, thus making them susceptible to single-step mutations. Thus, clarithromycin resistance in these species of rapidly growing mycobacteria relates to a point mutation in the gene coding for 23S rRNA and occurs in limited clinical situations, but was identified in almost 5% of isolates tested in 1995.
