BACKGROUND: Cyclosporin A has an adequate immunosuppressive capacity and can be useful in the treatment of non infectious ocular inflammatory diseases. AIM: To describe the clinical effect of cyclosporin A treatment in low doses, along with corticosteroids, in the treatment of refractory ocular inflammatory diseases. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty patients (13 female), aged 17 to 74 years old with severe and refractory ocular inflammatory diseases were studied. All except one, received variable doses of prednisone (10 to 60 mg/kg/day) and all received cyclosporin in doses that started in 2.5 mg/day and were increased to 5 mg/kg/day, according to clinical response. Patients were followed from 8 to 24 months, with monthly assessments of ocular inflammation (using a four point score), visual acuity and adverse effects of treatment. RESULTS: A two points or more reduction in the ocular inflammation score was observed in 52% of patients. Visual acuity improved in 10 subjects, stabilized in 8 and worsened in 2. Prednisone doses were reduced in most patients. Observed adverse effects were hypertension in 2 patients, creatinine elevation in 2, gastrointestinal disturbances in 3 and hypertrichosis in 12. A reduction of cyclosporin dose was required in these cases, but it was discontinued only in one patient with a vascular purpura. CONCLUSIONS: Low cyclosporin doses, associated to prednisone, are useful to reduce inflammation and improve visual acuity in patients with non infectious ocular inflammatory diseases, refractory to other treatment methods.
