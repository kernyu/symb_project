Surveillance of antituberculosis drug resistance is an essential tool for evaluating the quality of tuberculosis control programmes. Consensus-based recommendations on uniform reporting of antituberculosis drug resistance surveillance data in Europe have been developed by a Working Group of the World Health Organization (WHO) and the International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease (IUATLD). Laboratories should use standardized methods for testing drug susceptibility with a quality assurance programme including national and international proficiency testing. The proportion of drug resistance, particularly resistance to isoniazid, rifampicin or both (multidrug resistance) among all definite, i.e. culture-positive, tuberculosis cases at the start of treatment is the major indicator of interest. It should be calculated separately among patients treated previously and among those who have never been treated with > or = 1 month of combined antituberculosis drugs. The Working Group recommends that, in countries in which resources allow, laboratories report drug susceptibility test results on all isolates of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex. Test results of the specimen at the start of treatment and clinical data from the notification should be linked using a suitable identifier. Results should be presented by calendar year and analysed by age, sex, place of birth, site of disease and sputum smear results. In countries in which a routine system cannot be organized, representative surveys or sentinel systems are possible alternatives. In some countries, the annual prevalence of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis may be estimated through a national laboratory reporting system.
