Tetrandrine (Tet) 0.5 microgram.ml-1 and 1 microgram.ml-1 potentiated 2.88- and 4.3-fold growth-inhibitory effects of doxorubicin (Dox) in Chinese hamster ovary cell line (CHO), respectively, while Tet 1 microgram.ml-1 and 2.5 micrograms.ml-1 potentiated 7.3- and 8.4-fold in its resistant cell line (CHO/Dox), respectively. The colony-forming efficiencies were reduced in CHO and CHO/Dox when the cells were treated with noncytotoxic doses of Tet 2.5 micrograms.ml-1 and 5 micrograms.ml-1 in combination with different concentration of Dox. Increase in accumulation of Dox in CHO/Dox cells was shown by fluorometry. The result indicated that Tet reversed the resistance to Dox in CHO/Dox cells.
