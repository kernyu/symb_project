Hyperproduction of the type IV plasmid-encoded dihydrofolate reductase was studied in Escherichia coli J62-2 (pUK1123). Hyperproduction of the enzyme was shown to occur not simply as a response to a given concentration of trimethoprim but also to the presence of thymidine in the medium. Before hyperproduction occurred the bacteria began to elongate and die, thus showing the symptoms of thymine starvation. Hyperproduction also required the presence of L-methionine, adenine and glycine, suggesting that the elevated production of the enzyme was a response to the ability of trimethoprim to starve the cell of thymine metabolites.
