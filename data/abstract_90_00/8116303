Infections of the female genitals are among the most common conditions seen by primary care physicians. Approximately 75% of all women experience at least one episode of vaginitis during their reproductive life. Bacterial flora of the female genital tract is complex and dynamic. Those organisms which may cause gynecological infections in the appropriate setting are often present at a different stage in the woman's life as normal flora. The treatment of gynecological infections is dependent on the symptoms of the patient, the pathogen, and the medical history with regard to recurrences of the same disease. Since identification of the pathogen is often difficult, empirical therapy is administered frequently, which requires detailed knowledge of the most common bacterial pathogens and the resistance pattern of these organisms. An accurate initial diagnosis is the best basis for appropriate therapy, especially in view of the fact that once empirical antibiotic therapy has been administered, signs and symptoms are modified and the site of infection is rendered much more obscure.
