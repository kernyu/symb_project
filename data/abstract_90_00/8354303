Ampicillin combined with sulbactam was tested at both fixed ratio (2:1 and 1:1) and fixed sulbactam concentrations (4 micrograms/ml, 8 micrograms/ml and 16 micrograms/ml) against 2440 consecutively isolated gram-negative bacilli. Sulbactam significantly enhanced the spectrum of ampicillin activity. Overall, at 8 micrograms/ml ampicillin inhibited 50% of the Enterobacteriaceae isolates, whereas 69% to 84% of the isolates were inhibited by the various sulbactam combinations. The widest spectrum of activity for ampicillin/sulbactam was achieved by testing at a fixed sulbactam concentration of 16 micrograms/ml, followed by the 1:1 ratio and the fixed 8 micrograms/ml (84%, 76% and 74% inhibited, respectively). The amount of sulbactam at the susceptible breakpoint concentrations of ampicillin markedly affected the percentage of susceptible strains. Combinations that include 8 micrograms/ml of sulbactam are suggested for consideration.
