The quinolones possess a high degree of in vitro activity against enteric bacteria, including Salmonella. This observation, coupled with the limitations of current antityphoid agents, has resulted in the evaluation of quinolones in the therapy of S. typhi infection, including both enteric fever and chronic intestinal carriage. In open uncontrolled trials, norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin and pefloxacin have been used successfully to treat more than 200 patients with culture-proven typhoid fever. In comparative clinical trials, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, pefloxacin or fleroxacin were equivalent or superior to standard antityphoid therapy. In separate studies, norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin were each effective in eliminating intestinal excretion of S. typhi in chronic carriers. Because of increasing resistance worldwide to conventional antityphoid drugs, and in view of the efficacy of the quinolones in the therapy of both typhoid fever and typhoid intestinal carriage, these drugs may become the treatment of choice for these important enteric infections.
