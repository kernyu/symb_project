Helicobacter pylori infection was detected in 93% of 174 patients with a peptic ulcer compared with 63% of 116 patients with normal findings (chi 2 = 37.3; P < 0.001) in a cohort of 834 consecutive patients examined by gastroscopy in Yirga Alem Hospital in south Ethiopia. Fourteen patients were given 14 days' treatment with metronidazole 500 mg t.i.d., doxycycline 100 mg b.i.d. and bismuth subnitrate mixture 150 mg q.i.d. Of 10 patients who returned for follow-up, only 2 patients were free from H. pylori and cured. Nineteen strains of H. pylori from 19 consecutive patients in the same hospital were tested for resistance in vitro against metronidazole, doxycycline and ampicillin. All but 1 were highly resistant to metronidazole; 2 were fully and 14 intermediate resistant against doxycycline. All strains were fully sensitive in vitro to ampicillin. Thus, peptic ulcer was strongly associated with H. pylori in south Ethiopia, but eradication of the infection was hampered by antibiotic resistance.
