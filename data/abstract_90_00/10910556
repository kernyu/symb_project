From 1982 to 1995, 71 children admitted in our medical center were diagnosed to have typhoid fever by culture or serology. Of the 71 children, most (83%) were aged 5-15 years. These children usually presented with fever and gastrointestinal symptoms, including abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea or vomiting, and constipation. Hepatosplenomegaly was the most common physical sign observed and abdominal tenderness ranked the second. Thrombocytopenia occurring in 9 patients (13%) was the most common mode of complication. Other complications included intestinal perforation (3%), rectal bleeding (3%), ascites or pleural effusion (4%), and meningitis (1%). The incidence of complications tended to be higher among children 5 years of age or older (p = 0.31). Most patients responded well to appropriate antimicrobial therapies. There was no mortality. Relapse was observed in two children, although both had received 10 days of chloramphenicol therapy. The clinical isolates of Salmonella typhi were susceptible in vitro to all the antibiotics tested, including chloramphenicol, which, however, showed a higher MIC90 level than other drugs tested. In conclusion, there were age-specific differences of typhoid fever in children in terms of the incidence and morbidity and antibiotic resistance of S. typhi has not been a problem in this area at least up to 1995.
