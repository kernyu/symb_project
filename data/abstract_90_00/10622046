An interactive voting session at the end of the European symposium on evolving therapies provided an opportunity for panel discussion on various therapeutic options based on a series of case studies. The interactive voting and subsequent discussion focused on the preferred options for first-line, second-line and salvage therapy. In addition, issues of compliance and drug resistance were addressed. All case studies were entirely hypothetical and were projected into the future when it is anticipated that today's investigational drugs are likely to be available for general use.
