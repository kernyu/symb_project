Zambian under-fives with malaria were selected on a positive thick blood smear for Plasmodium falciparum of at least 1000 parasites/microliter on the day of admission. During a chloroquine course, daily follow-up of parasitaemia was performed. Bloodsamples were taken on day 0 and day 3 to measure chloroquine levels before admission and after treatment. Eighty four patients were evaluated in this study. Forty eight patients did not meet all criteria. Thirty six patients met all criteria, of which 16 (44.5%) patients were infected with sensitive strains (S) and 20 (55.5%) with resistant strains (R) of P.falciparum.
