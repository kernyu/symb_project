The trial of a new antibiotic dirithromycin against acute pharyngitis and tonsillitis for safety and efficacy included 28 patients with acute tonsillitis and pharyngitis. Microbiological, biochemical, clinical and laboratory tests were conducted throughout the treatment and 2-3 weeks after the end of dirithromycin administration. The results support dirithromycin clinical potential in acute, chronic pharyngeal inflammation due to its high selective activity in relation to beta-hemolytic streptococcus A and the absence of side effects.
