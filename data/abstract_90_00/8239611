Fifty subjects with acute uncomplicated falciparum malaria were treated orally with a new micronized formulation of halofantrine. The dose given corresponded to one-half the normal dose for the standard formulation. Parasitemia cleared in all subjects within 78 h. There was recrudescence of falciparum malaria in seven subjects after day 14. The mean +/- standard deviation clearance times of parasitemia and fever were 49.0 +/- 14.2 and 24.3 +/- 13.2 h, respectively. Other clinical symptoms related to malaria cleared within the first 3 days. Pruritus occurred in two subjects, back pain occurred in one subject, and diarrhea occurred in one subject; all of these symptoms were mild. Hematological and biochemical indices were not adversely affected by treatment except in five subjects in whom minor and transitory increases in aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase were observed. Micronized halofantrine appears to be a safe, well-tolerated, and effective treatment for acute falciparum malaria in semiimmune patients.
