Genetic elements coding for resistance to MLS group of antibiotics occur also in plasmids of staphylococcal cells. Wide distribution of such plasmids and their high segregational stability justify undertaking of detailed studies on their molecular structure and stability. It was shown that erm gene from pE3692 plasmid is located inside ClaI-HindIII segment of 1.3 kb dimension. Constructed pBE-9/1 plasmid, derivative of pE3692-9, contains inserted pBR322 vector in position ClaI. This plasmid replicates in E. coli and B. subtilis cells. It seems that Hind III-ClaI segment (0.8 hb) from pE3692 plasmid contains all indispensable genes for pE3692 replication. Excicion of Sta t (0.3 kb) fragment from pE3692 plasmid reduced considerably its stability. This segment may constitute a longer sequence fragment responsible for the stability of pE3692 plasmid.
