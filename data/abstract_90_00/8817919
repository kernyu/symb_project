A strain of Penicillium freii was transformed to hygromycin B resistance using the pAN7-1 plasmid. The transformation frequency was approximately 100 transformants per microgram DNA per 1 x 10(7) protoplasts. Southern blotting revealed different types of integration into the genome of P.freii. When non-selectable plasmid DNA was added together with pAN7-1, this resulted in a cotransformation frequency of more than 60%. The cotransformation frequency was estimated using a facile DNA extraction method together with PCR.
