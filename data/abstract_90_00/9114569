OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of triple-drug therapy for Helicobacter pylori infection and the effect of its eradication on relapse of ulcer in patients with duodenal ulcer (DU) disease. METHODS: Patients with uncomplicated DU who were H. pylori-positive on urease test or histology were given triple-drug therapy (metronidazole, tetracycline, colloidal bismuth subcitrate). Ulcer healing and H. pylori status were assessed one month after completion of therapy. Those with healed ulcers were followed up endoscopically for ulcer recurrence at 3-month intervals for one year or more. RESULTS: Fifty seven of 60 consecutive DU patients (95%) who were H. pylori-positive were taken up for the study; 46 patients (36 men; median age 40 years, range 13-70) completed the study. Thirty one of them (67%) eradicated H. pylori and had healed ulcers at one month post therapy; of 15 patients with persistent H. pylori infection, ulcers healed in 12 (p = ns). After an average follow up of 11 months, 8 of 12 H. pylori-positive patients had relapse of DU compared to 5 of 31 (16%) H. pylori-negative patients (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Triple-drug therapy was effective and safe for H. pylori infection, the lower rate of eradication observed compared to results elsewhere probably being related to bacterial resistance. Eradication of H. pylori was associated with healing of ulcers, resolution of antral gastritis and a significant fall in the rate of ulcer relapse.
