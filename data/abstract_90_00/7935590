A 29-year-old female suffering from full-blown AIDS received fluconazole 400 mg day-1 for a long period for treatment of oral candidosis, pseudomembranous type. She had previously received this drug repeatedly for the same reason, yet manifest disease persisted. She was therefore put on parenteral amphotericin B, which led to clinical, but not mycological, cure in the short term. IC30 testing revealed a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) > 128 micrograms ml-1 for fluconazole. The isolate, however, was susceptible in vitro to ketoconazole, itraconazole and amphotericin B. The same antimicrobial susceptibility pattern was found with a second isolate obtained later. Resistance to fluconazole might become a major problem in HIV-infected patients receiving this drug for long periods.
