There is potential for the normal faecal flora of humans to be augmented by resistant strains of bacteria, acquired from food. The frequency of resistance in the aerobic Gram-negative faecal flora is often very high. The purpose of this study was to find out whether food strains contribute to this resistance. One hundred and thirty-seven vegetable samples were studied, 48 of Finnish origin, and 89 imported. From these samples, 535 different strains of bacteria belonging to the family Enterobacteriaceae were isolated. Enterobacter spp. were most frequent, Escherichia coli was rare. Sensitivity testing was undertaken only for isolates with different biotypes and antibiograms. No resistance was found to cefotaxime, aztreonam, imipenem, gentamicin, nalidixic acid or ciprofloxacin. The frequency of trimethoprim resistance was 0.2%, sulphamethoxazole resistance 1.3%, and tetracycline resistance 5.5%. These frequencies were much lower than those found in faecal flora. Chloramphenicol and cefuroxime resistance was found in 12% and 14% of isolates, respectively. The only statistically significant differences between the Finnish and imported strains were for these two; the Finnish isolates were more resistant to cefuroxime, whereas the imported ones were more resistant to chloramphenicol. Consequently, bacteria from vegetables are not responsible for the high prevalence of resistant Enterobacteriaceae in faecal flora in Finland; they are in fact unusually susceptible to the antibiotics studied. Multiresistance profiles, typical of strains associated with human activities, were not identified in these isolates.
