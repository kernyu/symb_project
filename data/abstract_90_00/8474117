The effect of plasmid pUK1123, which confers low level resistance to trimethoprim when tested on solid minimal medium, but also no resistance when tested on IsoSensitest agar, was investigated in liquid media. The growth of Escherichia coli J62-2, harbouring pUK1123, was unaffected in liquid minimal medium containing trimethoprim 10 mg/L. However, in IsoSensitest broth, exposure to this drug concentration resulted in bacteriostasis. After an initial delay, resistance to trimethoprim was induced in IsoSensitest broth containing trimethoprim 10 mg/L, by the imposition of thymine starvation. This response was immediately reversible when trimethoprim was removed, confirming that resistance resulted from induction rather than selection of resistant mutants.
