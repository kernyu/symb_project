Widespread resistance problems exist today in a global sense because of the incorporation of antibiotics with a high resistance potential into animal feeds and because of the uncontrolled use of antibiotics with a high resistance potential in the clinical setting. The only proven method of controlling nonoutbreak resistance problems in hospitals is to limit the hospital formulary to antibiotics with little or no resistance potential. The control of multiresistant organisms in outbreaks occurring in hospitals is best contained using appropriate infection control containment measures. Physicians treating infections in the community, with all other factors being equal, should preferentially select antibiotics with a low resistance potential. The titles and headings of much of the resistance literature are misleading. Articles should not contain fluoroquinolone resistant in the title when ciprofloxacin-resistant organisms are described. Many articles concerning penicillin-resistant pneumococci are entitled fluoroquinolone-resistant S. pneumoniae. These articles describe ciprofloxacin-resistant S. pneumoniae and not resistance to other fluoroquinolones. The same error is perpetuated in describing third-generation cephalosporins and carbapenems. Virtually all of the resistance problems associated with third-generation cephalosporins and carbapenems are due to ceftazidime or imipenem. More precise titling in the literature would remind physicians that antibiotic resistance is related to a specific agent and not class phenomena.
