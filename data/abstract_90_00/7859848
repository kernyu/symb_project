The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of ampicillin, chloramphenicol, trimetoprimsulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, pefloxacin, enoxacin and fleroxacin for Salmonella spp. (n = 72) and Shigella spp. (n = 52) were established. S. typhi isolates were all susceptible to all of the antibiotics tested. In non-typhi salmonellae and Shigella spp., resistance to ampicillin, chloramphenicol and TMP-SMX with various rates were encountered, but all isolates were susceptible to fluoroquinolones.
