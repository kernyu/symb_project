We have carried out bacteriological and clinical studies on L-627. The results are summarized as follows. Treatment with L-627 was made in 14 cases of pediatric bacterial infections including 5 cases of pneumonia and 2 cases each of tonsillitis, urinary tract infection and one case each of colitis, and phlegmon. Results obtained were excellent in 11 cases, good in 2 cases and poor in one case. The bacteriological effect of L-627 was excellent, all causative organisms (Staphylococcus aureus one strain, Streptococcus pyogenes 2 strains, Streptococcus pneumoniae 3 strains, Escherichia coli 3 strains, Haemophilus influenzae one strain, Haemophilus parainfluenzae one strain) were eradicated. No significant side effects due to the drug were observed in any cases, except 2 cases each of elevated eosinophil counts and elevated platelet counts.
