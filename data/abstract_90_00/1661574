The strains of El Tor Vibrio cholerae were exposed to different concentrations of pesticides (fazolone, treflane, prometrine, magnesium chlorate, omait and gardon) and mineral fertilizers (superphosphate, ammophos and carbamide) for 2 to 135 days. The subcultures of various ages were tested for their sensitivity to 16 antibiotics. The whole of 229 cultures were tested. There was a general tendency to lowering of the El Tor vibrio sensitivity to the majority of the antibiotics tested. The vibrio strains resistant to the antibiotics widely used in medical practice i. e. levomycetin, streptomycin, tetracycline, lincomycin, neomycin and kanamycin were isolated.
