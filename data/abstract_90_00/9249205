The activity of methicillin, oxacillin, vancomycin, imipenem and FK037 against 106 isolates of staphylococci was assessed using a microbroth dilution method with low (10(5) cfu/mL) and high (10(7) cfu/mL) inoculum sizes. Overall, FK037, an oxime-type cephem antibiotic, was as active as imipenem, but less active than vancomycin (MIC90s 25, 25 and 6.25 mg/L, respectively) at the lower inoculum. Efficiency of plating experiments were also performed to characterize phenotypic expression of resistance to FK037, imipenem and methicillin. Five of 24 isolates and 18 of 24 isolates contained subpopulations resistant to FK037 and imipenem, respectively. In a rabbit model of endocarditis, FK037 was equally effective as other antibiotics tested in the treatment of methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus infection. In the treatment of endocarditis due to a homotypic methicillin-resistant S. aureus, FK037 and vancomycin were the most active antibiotics. The presence of subpopulations resistant to imipenem and FK037, as demonstrated by efficiency of plating and high inoculum MIC testing, did not correlate with antibiotic effectiveness in the rabbit model of endocarditis. Cultures of vegetation material following treatment with imipenem and FK037 demonstrated a lower frequency of organisms resistant to FK037 when compared with imipenem. Thus FK037 shows in-vitro and in-vivo activity against some methicillin-resistant staphylococcal species.
