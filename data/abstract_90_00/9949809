Multiple drug resistance in mycobacteria compromises the use of antibiotics. Although the genetic and biochemical bases of antibiotic resistance in mycobacteria are largely understood, a number of questions remain to be addressed. This chapter discusses the potential roles of hypermutability and compensatory mutations in establishing stable resistant phenotypes in the pathogenic mycobacteria.
