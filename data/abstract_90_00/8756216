BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to determine the antimicrobian susceptibility of the anaerobe bacteria isolated from clinical samples in the authors' department in 1993. METHODS: The minimum inhibitory concentrations of 10 antimicrobians were determined in microgram/ml for 129 anaerobe bacterias by the microdilution in broth method recommended by the NCCLS. RESULTS: All The strains were sensitive to chloramphenicol. Metronidazole inhibited all the isolates except A. meyeri and 50% of other non spored gram-positive bacilli. Imipenen and piperacillin-tazobactam were the most active beta lactamics, with only 1 B. fragilis being resistant to both. Clavulanic amoxycillin presented good activity with only 5% from the B. fragilis group, 1 F. mortiferum and 2 P. anaerobius being resistant. In the B. fragilis group 10% were resistant to cefoxitin and 15% to piperacillin. The remaining isolates were sensitive to both antimicrobians. Resistance to clindamycin in the B. fragilis group was 16.7%. There were also strains resistant to Peptostreptococcus, Prevotella and aerotolerant non spored gram-positive bacilli. Penicillin and amoxycillin were the least active antimicrobians. CONCLUSIONS: Chloramphenicol, metronidazole, imipenem, piperacillin-tazobactam and clavulanic amoxycillin were very effective and showed a wide spectrum of activity versus the strains studied. Cefoxitin, piperacillin and clindamycin maintain good antianaerobe activity.
