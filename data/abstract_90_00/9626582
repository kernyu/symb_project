Glioblastoma is one of the most malignant of all neoplasms, and often shows resistance to chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Ionizing radiation activates transcriptional factors, such as nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-kappa B). Previously we found that glutathione (GSH) synthesis is induced by cytokines mediated by NF-kappa B (Urata et al. J. Biol. Chem., 1996). Here, we present direct evidence that NF-kappa B activated by ionizing radiation induces the expression of gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase (gamma-GCS), the rate limiting enzyme of GSH synthesis, using T98G human glioblastoma cells. T98G cells have approximately 14-times the level of intracellular GSH of NB9 cells, radiation-sensitive neuroblastoma cells. In T98G cells, 30-Gy of ionizing radiation was required for the activation of NF-kappa B on an electrophoretic mobility shift assay and the induction of gamma-GCS mRNA on Northern blots and a nuclear run-on assay. However, when T98G cells were treated with buthionine sulfoximine, 3-Gy of ionizing radiation stimulated the DNA-binding activity of NF-kappa B and the expression of gamma-GCS. We constructed chimeric genes containing various regions of gamma-GCS promoter gene and the coding region for Luciferase. T98G cells transiently transfected with a plasmid containing the gamma-GCS promoter-luciferase construct showed increased luciferase activity when treated with ionizing radiation. The luciferase activity stimulated by ionizing radiation was found in the gamma-GCS promoter containing the NF-kappa B binding site, whereas not in that containing its mutated site. These results suggest that GSH synthesis is upregulated by ionizing radiation mediated by NF-kappa B and a high concentration of GSH in T98G cells causes downregulation of the NF-kappa B-DNA binding activity in response to ionizing radiation. The irresponsiveness of the intracellular signal transduction cascade to irradiation may be a factor in the resistance of T98G cells to radiation therapy.
