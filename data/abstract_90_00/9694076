Using the LXSN backbone, a defective retroviral vector (LISN) was constructed that encodes the human interferon (IFN)-alpha2 (hIFN-alpha2) gene and the neomycin resistance gene; the hIFN-alpha2 gene was cloned from human placental genomic DNA. High titers of the LISN retrovirus were produced by the amphotropic packaging cell line GP+envAM12. LISN is able to infect three human hematopoietic and leukemic cell lines: K562, LAMA-84, and TF-1. G418-resistant cells were detected in a similar proportion after infection with either the LISN retroviral vector or the LnLSN retroviral vector (encoding the nlsLacZ gene instead of hIFN-alpha2), suggesting that hIFN-alpha2 does not inhibit (or only partially inhibits) the production of retroviral particles by the packaging cell line and the infection of human cells. LISN-infected cells express and secrete hIFN-alpha2 as demonstrated by Northern blot analysis of poly(A)+ RNA, detection of the intracellular protein by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis, and detection of secreted hIFN-alpha in cell supernatants using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Retrovirally produced hIFN-alpha2 is biologically active, as demonstrated by the partial inhibition of the growth of K562 and TF-1, the modulation of the expression of cell surface antigens, the induction of the (2'-5') oligoadenylate synthetase, and, for LAMA-84, the down-modulation of the BCR-ABL protein. We conclude that the infection of human leukemic cell lines with a retroviral vector encoding hIFN-alpha2 is feasible and induces the expected biological effects. This experimental model will be useful in investigating the possibility of transducing normal and leukemic cells and hematopoietic progenitors and in determining the consequences of the autocrine production of hIFN-alpha2 on the behavior of these cells.
