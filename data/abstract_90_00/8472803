Only scanty data are available on the susceptibility of Haemophilus influenzae in Italy. The in vitro activity of ampicillin, ampicillin-sulbactam, cefaclor, cefuroxime, cefotaxime, chloramphenicol, erythromycin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole against 327 strains of Haemophilus influenzae (55 encapsulated, 272 non-typeable) isolated from adults and children in northern Italy, between January 1984 and December 1989, was compared. Patients were affected by meningitis or other invasive infections, conjunctivitis, otitis, sinusitis, pneumonia or bronchitis. Minimal inhibiting concentrations were determined by a microdilution technique in Mueller Hinton broth supplemented with 10 microliters/ml NAD and 2-5% lysed horse blood. A concentration of 1 x 10(5) to 5 x 10(5) CFU/ml was used as the inoculum. The antibiotics were tested at concentrations ranging from 0.03 to 64 microliters/ml with the exception of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, for which the range of concentrations examined were 0.01/0.25 to 32/512 microliters/ml. All the strains tested were susceptible to ampicillin-sulbactam, cefuroxime and cefotaxime, and more than 95% were susceptible to ampicillin, cefaclor and chloramphenicol. Only 4% were susceptible to erythromycin but most minimal inhibiting concentrations fell into the intermediate category. Strains isolated from adults were more susceptible to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole than strains isolated from children (85% vs 66%; p = 0.011).
