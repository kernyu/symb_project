Microbial resistance to conventional as well as newly introduced drugs is a hallmark feature of several infectious diseases, notably tuberculosis. It is hypothesized that the greater the selective pressure exerted by increasingly potent drugs, the more rapidly is an organism able to adapt to a drug-containing environment. The roles of drug-containing environments, and the immunological status of the host and bacterial molecular mechanisms of development of drug resistance to Mycobacterium tuberculosis have been examined and examples cited for implementation of modified drug regimens in tuberculosis-control programmes. The views expressed, albeit restricted to Mycobacterium tuberculosis, encourage consideration of drug regimens on a disease evolution basis as well as understanding of the natural rules that govern development and sustenance of drug resistance in the microbial world.
