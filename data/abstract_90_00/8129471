During the progress, in 1989, of a programme of social marketing of condoms in Cameroon, it was obvious that this approach should be supplemented by a similar programme for the management of STD's. Nine surveys were carried out in 1992 in Yaounde and Douala in the sexually most active male population (in the general community, at the workplace and in the leisure environment) in order to collect the basic data necessary for its implementation. Treatment essentially consists of mono-chemotherapy with drugs which are generally inefficient against the two principal etiologies of urethritis: Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis. The cost of treatment is considered excessive and leads to poor follow-up of the complete prescription. Simultaneous treatment of partners should be developed. All these data have been taken into account for the elaboration of a pilot programme which should be implemented in 1993.
