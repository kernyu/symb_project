A case of a 73-year-old woman with acute renal failure due to toxic shock syndrome (TSS) is reported. The patient was admitted to our hospital with the complaints of high fever, disturbance of consciousness and shock. Laboratory findings on admission were; CRP 25.11 mg/dl, WBC 35000/ microl, Plt 1.6 x 10(4)/ microl, GOT 155 U/l, GPT 65 U/l, CPK 4202 U/l (CPK-MM 96%), BUN 123 mg/dl and SCr 7.0 mg/dl. Because of anuria, hemodialysis was performed. This patient was treated with dopamine, methyl prednisolone (MP), frozen fresh plasma, AT III, antibiotics, and platelet transfusion. The bacterial cultures of blood and cerebrospinal fluid were negative, but MRSA was isolated subsequently from the pharynx and vagina. We investigated the production of toxic shock syndrome toxin 1 (TSST-1) and staphylococcal enterotoxins (SE). The isolated MRSA produced TSST-1, SEB and SEC. Accordingly, we made the diagnosis of TSS. After improvement of acute renal failure and the patient's general condition, MRSA persisted and TSST-1 was still found in the patient's blood. Finally we eradicated the MRSA and TSST-1 after administration of ciprofloxacin hydrochloride (CPFX) and Rifampicin (RFP).
