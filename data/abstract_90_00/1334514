In a 48-week open trial, 18 patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA), resistant to second line agents, received 200 mg minocycline daily. Twelve patients completed 48 weeks of therapy. Statistically significant improvement was noted in almost all variables of disease activity. Three patients discontinued therapy because of lack of improvement, 2 patients because of side effects and one patient was lost to followup. Cytofluorographic analysis revealed a significant decrease in expression of a T cell activation antigen (gp 26). Our data suggest that minocycline could be a useful therapeutic agent in RA.
