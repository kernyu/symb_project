The effects of inoculation of LP-BM5 murine leukemia retrovirus and chronic ethanol (5% v/v) ingestion on immunomodulation and Cryptosporidium parvum infection in C57BL/6 female mice were evaluated. The intestinal mucosae of retrovirally immunosuppressed animals were heavily colonized by Cryptosporidium parasites, and oocysts shedding in the feces persisted throughout the duration of the study. Mortality was exacerbated by murine retrovirus infection alone and exacerbated with concomitant chronic alcohol feeding (42.8 and 69.4%). Chronic ethanol ingestion decreased production of interferon-gamma and soluble interleukin-2 receptor released in supernatants of splenocytes when stimulated with concanavalin A, compared with the control group. Decreased production of interferon-gamma and interleukin-2 receptor was further exacerbated due to retrovirus infection. Tumor necrosis factor production by splenocytes stimulated with lipopolysaccharide, however, was significantly increased because of retrovirus infection. LP-BM5 retrovirus infection alone as well as with concomitant ethanol feeding altered cytokine production, which might have led to immunodeficiency. These changes may help explain the enhanced persistence of Cryptosporidiosis.
