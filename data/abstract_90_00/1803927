This study was undertaken to elucidate the presence of anthelmintic resistance in nematode parasites of sheep in Denmark. Twenty two flocks of sheep were selected for Faecal Egg Count Reduction (FECR) tests, based on a prior history of either the same anthelmintic, or anthelmintic class having been used 3 times or more over the previous 5 years. Evidence of anthelmintic resistance was detected in 7 flocks. Two flocks showed FECR of 88% and 94% after treatment with thiabendazole, FECR of another 2 were 90% and 94% following treatment with fenbendazole. Three flocks showed FECR of 73%, 89% and 94%, respectively following the use of levamisole. Ostertagia circumcincta was isolated from 1 of the latter flocks and subjected to an in vivo controlled slaughter assay. Following treatment with levamisole at the recommended dose rate of 7.5 mg/kg, FECR was 44.5% and worm counts were reduced by 67.7%. These results were further substantiated by an in vitro egg hatch paralysis assay and by measuring pepsinogen levels in treated and non-treated lambs. This is the first instance of anthelmintic resistance in sheep nematodes in Scandinavia.
