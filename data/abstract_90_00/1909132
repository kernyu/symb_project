A 4.1. Kb large DNA fragment of a E. coli plasmid pVU 3695, on which the genes for formaldehyde-resistance are located, was used as a DNA probe to identify bacteria that carry this segment among formaldehyde-resistant bacteria. It was shown by Southern Blot-, Dot Blot-, and Colony Blot- Hybridization studies that the DNA of all formaldehyde-resistant E. coli, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii and Klebsiella pneumoniae strains tested hybridize with the DNA probe from E. coli. In contrast the E. coli DNA probe does not hybridize with the DNA from formaldehyde-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains.
