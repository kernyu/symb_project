Effect of fluorouracil in combination with ascorbate and L-valin, modifiers of lipid metabolism was studied in cultured protozoa Crithidia oncopelti. The inhibitory effect of preparation in a concentration of 100 mcg/ml gradually decreased in the course of cultivation. Its readdition to a 96-hour culture did not increase its effect on protozoa cells. Combined addition of fluorouracil and modifiers (100 mcg/ml each) resulted in insignificant decrease of the cell accumulation in the culture as compared with the effect of fluorouracil alone. When fluorouracil and modifiers were readded to the 96-hour culture, the trypanostatic effect of preparation was 2.5 times enhanced. This enhancement was confirmed by destructive alterations in cell morphology and by the culture lysis by 192 h of protozoa cultivation.
