During 1991-1995 a Spain collaborative study group surveyed the resistance to cefotaxime both in community as well as in hospital isolates of bacteria. The isolates tested during the study period of 5 years were 813, 875, 3631, 3184, and 3050 strains, respectively. Antimicrobial activity of cefotaxime was assayed by broth or agar microdilution, in accordance with criteria of the National Committee of Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS). Cefotaxime resistance included 2.5% of all isolates: 2.6% Enterobacteriaceae, 1.7% Streptococcus pneumoniae, 0.5% Haemophilus influenzae, 0.0% Haemophilus spp., and 0.0% Moraxella catarrhalis. The overall incidence of resistance to cefotaxime decreased fro member of Enterobacteriaceae from 3.6% in 1991 to 2.5% in 1995. The incidence of resistance varied with the species and was highest in Enterobacter and in Citrobacter freundii.
