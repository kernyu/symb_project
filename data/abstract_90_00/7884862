Development of viral resistance to the aminodiol human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) protease inhibitor BMS 186,318 was studied by serial passage of HIV type 1 RF in MT-2 cells in the presence of increasing concentrations of compound. After 11 passages, an HIV variant that showed a 15-fold increase in 50% effective dose emerged. This HIV variant displays low-level cross-resistance to the C2 symmetric inhibitor A-77003 but remains sensitive to the protease inhibitors Ro 31-8959 and SC52151. Genetic analysis of the protease gene from a drug-resistant variant revealed an Ala-to-Thr change at amino acid residue 71 (A71T) and a Val-to-Ala change at residue 82 (V82A). To determine the effects of these mutations on protease and virus drug susceptibility, recombinant protease and proviral HIV type 1 clones containing the single mutations A71T and V82A or double mutation A71T/V82A were constructed. Subsequent drug sensitivity assays on the mutant proteases and viruses indicated that the V82A substitution was responsible for most of the resistance observed. Further genotypic analysis of the protease genes from earlier passages of virus indicated that the A71T mutation emerged prior to the V82A change. Finally, the level of resistance did not increase following continued passage in increasing concentrations of drug, and the resistant virus retained its drug susceptibility phenotype 34 days after drug withdrawal.
