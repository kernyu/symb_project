Burkholderia cepacia is a widespread, environmental gram-negative bacillus that is associated with nosocomial infections. This bacterium is considered to be an important pathogen in immunocompromised patients and is inherently resistant to multiple antimicrobial agents. To compare the activity of different antimicrobial agents and the potential of combinations against invasive strains of B. cepacia, we collected 36 isolates of B. cepacia from blood cultures and checked their susceptibilities to 13 antimicrobials by broth microdilution method. Most strains tested were susceptible to minocycline (94.4%), ceftazidime (86.1%), ciprofloxacin (83.3%), and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (83.3%). All strains were resistant to aminoglycosides, and only some strains were susceptible to imipenem (16.7%), aztreonam (19.4%), moxalactam (25.0%), piperacillin (25.0%), and carbenicillin (47.2%). The effects of combinations of ceftazidime with amikacin, ceftazidime with ciprofloxacin, and ciprofloxacin with amikacin were assayed by checkerboard titration method. Synergistic effect was found in 28 out of 36 tested strains (77.8%), when ceftazidime was combined with amikacin, in 25 out of 36 strains (69.4%) when ceftazidime was combined with ciprofloxacin, and in only 8 out of 36 strains (22.2%) when ciprofloxacin was combined with amikacin.
