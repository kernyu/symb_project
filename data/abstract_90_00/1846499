The isolation and description of acyclovir-resistant (ACVR) herpes simplex-2 viruses from patients with AIDS has recently been reported. These ACVR viruses were all markedly decreased in their thymidine kinase (TK) activity, and 6 of 10 of these TK viruses were able to establish latency. In addition, one of these isolates, ACVR-86012 was neuropathogenic in a murine encephalitis model. In this paper, the characteristics of these isolates with respect to TK polypeptide synthesis are examined. All but one isolate synthesized a detectable TK protein by immunoprecipitation, and 9/10 of the TK proteins had an altered electrophoretic mobility as compared to wild-type. The TK polypeptide from the neuropathogenic isolate ACVR-86012 was full-length and the gene was sequenced. An amino acid change from a glutamine to a proline at amino acid residue 105 was detected compared to the wild-type HSV-333 strain. These results indicate that an amino acid change in the NH2 portion of the TK protein is associated with a full-length peptide with decreased enzyme activity but the virus retains neuropathic virulence.
