From 1980 to 1991, 925 non epidemic hospital isolates of S. aureus were selected and phage typed. MIC of 20 antibiotics and 4 antiseptics were determined by agar dilution method. The proportion of isolates susceptible to all antibiotics remains constant; however the trend to the resistance is strong during the study period (oxacillin 10-->20%, erythromycin 17-->28%, pefloxacin 4-->19%...). Strains resistant to oxacillin become more and more multiple resistant; some of recent isolates are resistant to 7 antibiotic families. There are very few products active against these strains i.e, glycopeptides (100%), pristinamycin (96%), fusidic acid (94%). This finding implies the need for continuous surveillance at the local and national level.
