The TOR gene (TOxic nucleoside Resistance gene) was mapped to a 2.3 kb fragment on the amplified DNA from tubercidin resistant Leishmania (TUB). This DNA fragment conferred upon wild type cells resistance to tubercidin, inosine dialdehyde, formycin A and B and allopurinol riboside and a reduced ability to accumulate purine nucleobases and nucleosides. These properties were characteristic of the parental TUB cells which carried the intact amplified DNA and have been hypothesized to be caused by a reduction in the activity of the multiple purine transporters within this organism. The TOR gene was found to be partially homologous to the rodent and human Oct-6/SCIP/Tst-1 gene. It lacked, however, the POU specific domain of this class of transcription factors and contained only the first two helices of the POU homeodomain. This truncated homeodomain was not required to confer resistance upon wild type cells to toxic nucleosides, suggesting that TOR was not a repressor with independent DNA binding capability.
