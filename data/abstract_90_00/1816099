The multiplication of A. culbertsoni in the peptone medium was not inhibited by 10-20 mM concentration of alpha-difluoromethyl ornithine (DMFO) while a partial and transient inhibition of cell multiplication was observed by 10-20 mM DFMO in proteose peptone, yeast extract, glucose (PYG) medium. Ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) activity in the cells and cell free extracts was strongly inhibited by DFMO, excluding enzyme refractoriness and impermeability of cells for DFMO as the possible causes of DFMO resistance. The presence of polyamines in the peptone and PYG media as well as uptake of polyamines by the amoebae has been demonstrated. The growth and multiplication of A. culbertsoni in chemically defined medium was not affected by 1-5 mM DFMO while 10-20 mM DMFO yielded partial inhibition. A lowering of diaminopropane levels and enhancement of spermidine levels was observed in DFMO inhibited cells and level of ODC was drastically reduced in the inhibited cultures. Uptake of polyamines from the growth media may partly account for DFMO resistance of A. culbertsoni. Alternative mechanisms for DFMO resistance are indicated.
