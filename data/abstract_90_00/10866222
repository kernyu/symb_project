Synthesis of new tricyclic carbapenems (trinems) with a pyrrolidinyl moiety at the C-4 position of the tricyclic ring and their antimicrobial activities were studied. These trinems showed potent activities against Gram-positive bacteria including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Among them, (4R)-[(S)-pyrrolidin-3-ylthiomethyl]trinem (14a) exhibited good activity against MRSA in vitro and in vivo.
