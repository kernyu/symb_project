Glutathione peroxidases (GPX), enzymes that catalyze the reduction of reactive intermediates have been implicated in the action of several cytostatic drugs. Two major types of GPX have been found: a selenium-dependent form (SeGPX) which is active with both hydrogen peroxide and organic hydroperoxides, and a selenium-independent GPX which is only active with organic hydroperoxides. SeGPX and total GPX (tGPX) activity were assayed in cytosolic fractions from malignant and adjacent normal tissue in 13 patients with oral/oropharyngeal, and 10 patients with laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma. Neck lymph node metastases were available from 2 and 5 of these patient respectively. Tumors from the oral/oropharyngeal region contained significantly less SeGPX and tGPX activity than laryngeal tumors. Primary oral/oropharyngeal and laryngeal tumors had lower SeGPX activities than the matched normal mucosa. tGPX activities were similar in normal and tumor tissue. Metastases contained slightly more SeGPX and tGPX activity than the matched tumor tissue. We conclude that the inherent anti-tumor drug resistance of human neck squamous cell carcinoma is not mediated by increased glutathione peroxidase enzyme activity in the tumor tissue.
