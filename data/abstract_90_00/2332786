The in vitro activity of cefroxadine was studied and found to be at least comparable to that previously reported for cefalexin and cefradine. The activity of cefroxadine was superior to that of amoxicillin against tested isolates. Time-killing studies showed that the addition of 4 X minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of cefroxadine to growing cultures reduced viable counts by 4 log units within a 3 h incubation. A diffusion test with a 30 microgram cefroxadine disk produced acceptable interpretive results with tentative zone size breakpoints of less than or equal to 14 mm for resistance and greater than or equal to 17 mm for susceptibility.
