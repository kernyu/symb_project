Copper complexes of L-alanine, L-arginine, L-histidine, L-lysine, L-proline and L-threonine were studied for their antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes and Escherichia Coli. The complexes of 1-alanine, 1-proline and 1-threonine were nearly as active as ampicillin against Strep. Pyogenes. Mixed complexes of these amino acids showed similar effect. Other complexes were also active to a significant extent against all the three strains studied.
