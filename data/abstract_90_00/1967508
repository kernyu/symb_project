The plasma levels of tumor necrosis factor were measured during a longitudinal survey of 84 subjects living in an endemic area of malaria. In most cases, the plasma tumor necrosis factor was found at its highest level during the malaria transmission peak and became normal again during the dry season. Children having suffered from malarial attack keep low tumor necrosis factor levels compared to adults and asymptomatic children. These results suggest that tumor necrosis factor could be associated with the development of resistance against malaria.
