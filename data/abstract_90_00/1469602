A series of 3-O-alkyl and 3-O-haloalkyl-D-glucoses were prepared from 1,2:5,6-di-O-isopropylidene-alpha-D-glucofuranose and their antibacterial activities were evaluated. The compounds with C12 and C14-alkyl chains were the most effective in vitro antibacterial screening, among 3-O-alkyl and 3-O-haloalkyl derivatives. The 3-O-alkyl derivatives were more effective than 3-O-haloalkyl derivatives.
