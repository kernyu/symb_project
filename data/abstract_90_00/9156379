The surveillance of pneumococcal resistance in nasopharyngeal isolates is a practical way to determine the prevalence of resistant strains and is a reasonable predictor of resistance in systemic isolates. The increasing prevalence of resistance is shifting the distribution of invasive pneumococcal serotypes toward those included in conjugate vaccines. If these vaccines reduce carriage, they may eliminate or greatly reduce the prevalence of resistant strains. Meningitis is the most important infection caused by PRP for which penicillin or ampicillin therapy is inappropriate. Although the extended spectrum cephalosporins will be effective for most cases of PRP meningitis, it is clear that such therapy is not foolproof. It is important for the laboratory to test CSF isolates not only for penicillin resistance but also for resistance to the cephalosporins. beta-Lactam antibiotics can still be considered appropriate empiric therapy for otitis media, pneumonia, or sepsis. However, occasional treatment failures with these agents may necessitate use of alternative therapeutic strategies.
