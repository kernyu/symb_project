The purpose of this study was to determine the extent and outcome of antifungal treatment in HIV/AIDS patients. Data obtained from patients attending a hospital-based, semi-urban comprehensive care HIV clinic, were retrospectively analysed. The clinic serves patients from urban, semi-urban and rural communities. A total of 751 confirmed black heterosexual HIV/AIDS patients received routine oral examinations and surveillance swabbing for oral yeast culture. Patients received nystatin solution as prophylaxis, miconazole for clinically detectable oral candidiasis and only in severe cases or cases of chronic candidiasis were they treated with either fluconazole or itraconazole. Treatment was regarded as successful when there was an absence or resolution of clinical lesions of oral candidiasis. Nystatin prophylaxis was prescribed to 7.9% of patients, miconazole treatment to 9.7% and 3.5% received fluconazole. Of the 60 patients who received nystatin prophylaxis, 40 (66.6%) had clinically detectable candidiasis. A negative statistical correlation was found between nystatin prophylaxis and clinically detectable candidiasis. Of 72 patients who received miconazole treatment, only 3 failed to respond. Eleven of the 27 patients who received fluconazole treatment did not return for follow-up visits. In the remaining 16 patients there was no recurrence of clinical symptoms during the following 3 - 24 months after treatment with fluconazole. It is concluded that nystatin prophylaxis proved not to be effective under these particular clinical circumstances. Resistance to azole antifungal medication is not yet a problem in this black heterosexual group of South African HIV/AIDS patients.
