When transformation of Botrytis cinerea occurred in mononucleated protoplasts the hygromycin resistance phenotype was stable and integrated plasmid DNA although rearranged was transmitted through meiosis. We observed that transformants were often heterokaryotic and using serial conidial transfer, we showed failure of expression of the entire copies of integrated plasmids in some conidial isolates. A non-Mendelian segregation of the hygromycin resistance phenotype was observed in most crosses between these transformants and sensitive strains. However, a 1:1 segregation ratio of plasmid DNA hybridisation was observed. Mechanisms of gene silencing in B. cinerea, in both the asexual and the sexual cycle, are discussed.
