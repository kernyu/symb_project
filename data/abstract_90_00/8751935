Epithelial cells, which form tight polarized monolayers on porous substrates, constitute ideal model systems to study bacterial adhesion and invasion. The binding of Helicobacter pylori to the apical membrane of T84 cells, an epithelial cell line derived from a human colon carcinoma, was assessed biochemically and morphologically. Attachment was rapid, and binding remained constant over time, with a significant (P < 0.01, Mann-Whitney U test) ca. fourfold increase at pH 5.4 (76% +/- 22%) compared with pH 7.4 (18% +/- 7%). In contrast, adhesion of enteropathogenic Escherichia coli was not enhanced at pH 5.4. The transepithelial electrical resistance of the T84 cell monolayers was not affected by pH or by H. pylori. Following binding, H. pylori induced a reorganization of the brush border as reflected by actin condensation, facilitating the intimate association of the bacteria with the apical plasma membrane. H.pylori was not internalized, as shown by confocal microscopy. Some bacteria, found in deep invaginations of the apical membrane, were probably inaccessible to gentamicin, thus accounting for the observed tolerance to the antibiotic. These data provide the first evidence that an acidic environment favors Helicobacter adhesion and that binding is followed by survival of the survival of the bacteria in pockets of the apical membrane.
