An investigation was carried out to determine whether or not here had been any changes in the susceptibility of clinically isolated strains of Trichophyton metagrophytes and Trichophyton rubrum (both leading causes of tinea) to bifonazole, an imidazole derivative and antifungal for topical use. Susceptibility was measured in 107 strains of these fungi isolated from clinical samples during a study on the treatment of tinea pedis with Mycospor cream in 1995, 42 strains isolated and stored in 1990, and 39 strains isolated and stored prior to development of the drug. The results are as follows: (1) There was no distinct difference in the susceptibility to bifonazole of T. mentagrophytes strains isolated before 1986 and those isolated in 1990 or 1995. (2) T. rubrum strains isolated before 1986 were slightly more susceptible to bifonazole than those isolated in 1995, while the 1990 strains were slightly less susceptible than the 1995 strains, but the difference was not significant. (3) The highest MICs of bifonazole for all the T. mentagrophytes and T. rubrum strains isolated from before 1986 and those in 1995 were relatively low, being 2.5 micrograms/ml and 1.25 micrograms/ml, respectively. These results suggest that no resistance or reduced susceptibility to bifonazole has emerged among clinical isolates of dermatophytes since the development of the drug.
