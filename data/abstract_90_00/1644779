The ExbD protein is involved in the energy-coupled transport of ferric siderophores, vitamin B12, and B-group colicins across the outer membrane of Escherichia coli. In order to study ExbD membrane topology, ExbD-beta-lactamase fusion proteins were constructed. Cells expressing beta-lactamase fusions to residues 53, 57, 70, 76, 78, 80, 92, 121, and 134 of ExbD displayed high levels of ampicillin resistance, whereas fusions to residues 9 and 19 conferred no ampicillin resistance. It is concluded that the only hydrophobic segment of ExbD, encompassing residues 23 to 43, forms a transmembrane domain and that residues 1 to 22 are located in the cytoplasm and residues 44 to 141 are located in the periplasm.
