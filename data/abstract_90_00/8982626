Antibiotic resistant pneumococci have been reported from all continents. Because of the importance of pneumococci in the aetiology of life-threatening diseases, the screening for penicillin resistance with oxacillin disc on all clinically significant isolates is suggested. However, discrepancy between the determination of penicillin resistance by oxacillin disc diffusion and the determination of penicillin minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) has been reported. On this basis we have examined seven strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae isolated from patients recovered for the exacerbation of chronic bronchitis which were oxacillin-resistant. The assay of penicillin MICs showed that three isolates were moderately resistant to this agent, while four isolates resulted sensitive to penicillin as well as to cefotaxime. These results suggest that a further evaluation of penicillin MIC should be performed on those strains of S. pneumoniae resulting oxacillin-resistant.
