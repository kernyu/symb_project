Twenty trials (17 controlled and three observational cohort studies) on selective decontamination of the digestive tract (SDD) have been undertaken to date. SDD is defined as a technique which aims to eradicate carriage of disease-causing microorganisms by means of lethal oropharyngeal and faecal antimicrobial concentrations. The SDD concept and the criteria for the choice of the antimicrobials used in the SDD programme are explained. Abolition of the carrier state is thought to provide clinical, bacteriological and epidemiological benefits. Infection-specific morbidity and mortality, emergence of antibiotic resistance and outbreaks are the main endpoints evaluated in this review. Of the 15 controlled studies that considered carriage, 14 demonstrated a significant reduction of Gram-negative bacillary (GNB) carriage. Severe infections, including pneumonia and septicaemia, caused by enterobacteria and pseudomonads have been virtually eliminated in these trials. Five of the 12 centres that evaluated mortality showed a significant decrease among patients who received SDD. Two recent trials describe the control of an outbreak with a multiresistant Klebsiella by SDD. There are three indications for the use of SDD so far: (i) in trauma patients; (ii) in certain elective surgical procedures including liver transplantation and oesophageal resection; and (iii) in control of outbreaks of ICU infection. Future lines of research may include a properly designed trial with mortality as endpoint and studies on the transfer of SDD from the ICU into the ward as part of prophylaxis in major surgery.
