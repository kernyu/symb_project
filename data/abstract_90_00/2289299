The pharmacokinetics of mefloquine (M) were studied in 59 male Thai patients with falciparum malaria. Mefloquine was administered alone (750 mg orally; group 1), or with primaquine (PQ, 45 mg; group 2), or in combination with sulfadoxine (1.5 g) + pyrimethamine (75 mg) (MSP; group 3), or as MSP + PQ (group 4). All patients in groups 1, 2 and 4 initially responded to treatment, but two patients from group 1 had RI recrudescent infections. One patient in group 3 failed to respond to treatment and was considered to have RII resistance, while a further patient from this group had RI recrudescence. The pharmacokinetic parameters for group 1 and group 3 were not significantly different. Co-administration of primaquine alone had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of mefloquine, but there was a statistically significant decrease in the terminal elimination half-life of mefloquine for group 4 relative to that for group 3.
