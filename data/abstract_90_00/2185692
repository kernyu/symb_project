Using an agar dilution assay, for 66 of 104 (63.5%) clinical isolates of Acinetobacter calcoaceticus biovar anitratus, the MIC of ciprofloxacin was greater than or equal to 1.0 micrograms/ml. Cross resistance was demonstrable to ciprofloxacin and gentamicin (P less than 0.001), amikacin (P less than 0.01), cefotaxime (P less than 0.001), azlocillin (P less than 0.001), ceftazidime (P less than 0.001), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (P less than 0.001), and minocycline (P less than 0.05). The mean MIC of ciprofloxacin for drug-susceptible isolates was consistently lower than that for resistant isolates; however, these differences were significant only for amikacin (P = 0.036).
