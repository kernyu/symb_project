BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Because of the increasing resistance of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, we studied the actual resistance of isolates in Berlin. PATIENTS/METHODS: 85 Neisseria gonorrhoeae isolates were collected between 1995 and 1997. Susceptibility testing was performed for penicillin G, tetracycline, spectinomycin, ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin and azithromycin by agar dilution. RESULTS: 18.8% isolates were resistant or intermediately resistant to penicillin G (including 6 PPNG). 12.9% isolates were resistant, 43.5% intermediately resistant to tetracycline. One strain was resistant against ciprofloxacin, 4 isolates showed increased MIC values (0.06-0.5 mg/l), whereas 78 isolates were fully susceptible (< 0.007 mg/l). All isolates were susceptible to spectinomycin, ceftriaxone, and azithromycin. CONCLUSIONS: Penicillin G and tetracycline should be given only in cases of proven sensibility. Resistance against ciprofloxacin may occur, especially in isolates acquired in south-east Asia. Ceftriaxone, spectinomycin and azithromycin were active against all isolates. The actual resistance situation should be monitored.
