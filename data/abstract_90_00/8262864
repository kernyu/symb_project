The in-vitro synergic activities of BRL42715, a new beta-lactamase inhibitor, clavulanic acid, sulbactam, and tazobactam combined with ampicillin, piperacillin, cephalothin, or cefoperazone were tested against various bacteria producing known types of beta-lactamase. BRL42715 showed the best synergistic activity among the inhibitors tested against strains producing penicillinases of type I, II, III, V, and that from Klebsiella pneumoniae, cephalosporinases, and oxyiminocephalosporinases (except that from Klebsiella oxytoca). Clavulanic acid combined with the beta-lactams tested showed the best synergic activity of the inhibitors against strains producing type IV penicillinase and oxyiminocephalosporinase from K. oxytoca. The 50% inhibitory doses of BRL42715 were superior to those of clavulanic acid against various types of beta-lactamases except for type IV penicillinase and the oxyiminocephalosporinase from K. oxytoca. The inhibitory activity of BRL42715 against cephalosporinases from various bacteria was 10(4) to 10(6)-fold greater than that of clavulanic acid. The synergic effects of BRL42715 and clavulanic acid on the activity of piperacillin were compared against six clinical isolates of bacteria resistant to piperacillin. The synergic activity of BRL42715 was greater than that of clavulanic acid in all six isolates.
