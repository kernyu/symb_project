Antimicrobial resistance is an important issue when treating patients with various bacterial, fungal, protozoal, and viral infections. Until recently, the focus of concern was on nosocomially acquired infections. However, organisms causing common community-acquired infections have now developed antimicrobial resistance. This paper provides a brief overview of this emerging global threat and discusses resistance in gram-positive organisms, outpatient and antibiotic use, and strategies to reduce antibiotic overuse. Curbing the overuse of antibiotics is crucial to reversing the increase in drug-resistant bacteria. We need to develop guidelines and educate physicians and the public on the use of antibiotics for respiratory syndromes with predominantly viral etiologies.
