In order to investigate whether transfer of the cytidine deaminase (CDD) cDNA would increase chemotherapy resistance to cytosine arabinoside (ara-C) we used a retroviral vector expressing both, neomycin phosphotransferase and the CDD cDNA, to transduce hematopoietic cells from cell lines and from murine bone marrow (BM). After coculture on producer clones with a viral titer of 1 x 10(5) CFU/ml and up to 3-fold increased CDD enzymatic activity, WEHI-3 cell line and primary hematopoietic cells were exposed to ara-C in clonogenic assays. A transduction efficiency of 34.8 +/- 6.2% could be determined for BM clonogenic progenitor cells by G418 resistance. We could observe significantly more colonies (77 +/- 3.1%) surviving from transduced primary BM cells than from mock cells (51.7 +/- 9.3%) at 10(-8) mol/l ara-C. At 10(-7) mol/l ara-C 8.7% of BM cells became absolutely resistant after retroviral transduction. Our data confirm that CDD represents another candidate gene for increasing resistance to cytotoxic drugs in hematopoietic cells.
