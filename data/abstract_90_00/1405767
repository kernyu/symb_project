During a 4-year period from November 1985 to November 1989, Aeromonas was isolated from wounds and soft tissues with clinical evidence of infection in 28 patients at our institution. Of the 28 patients, 23 (82%) had sustained an acute open or penetrating injury, more than half of which (13 of the 23) were water-related trauma. One patient had Aeromonas osteomyelitis. Five patients had no history of trauma, and three of these five had an underlying chronic disease. Treatment included debridement and antimicrobial agents. Susceptibility testing on 25 isolates from 23 patients showed uniform resistance to ampicillin and considerable resistance to cefazolin sodium (68%), but all isolates were sensitive to gentamicin sulfate, cefuroxime sodium, and the third-generation cephalosporins.
