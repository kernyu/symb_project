In 1994-1996 the Santarishkes republican tuberculous hospital (Lithuania) has admitted 98 patients (82 males, 16 females) with polyresistant tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis were resistant to at least isoniazid and rifampicin). Of these, 13 patients were untreated, 17 had recurrences, 68 had chronic tuberculosis. After polyresistance of M. tuberculosis was found, the patients received an individual treatment with sensitive drugs. 20 patients were operated. The absence of bacteria was achieved only in 24 (24.5%) patients. Tuberculous lesions in the lungs disappeared and clinical symptoms relieved in 14 of them. In 74(75.5%) nonresponders the course of the disease was unfavourable. Negative treatment outcomes were observed in 38.5%, 64.7% and 85.3% of new-onset, recurrent and chronic cases, respectively.
