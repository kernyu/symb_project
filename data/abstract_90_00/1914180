Peroxidation of lipids is believed to play a key role in various degenerative diseases. However, few simple tests are able to detect individual susceptibility or resistance to peroxidation. Measurement of the basal concentrations of lipid peroxides in plasma is not satisfactory because they are so low. Therefore, we developed a test to determine susceptibility of whole plasma to metal/H2O2-catalyzed peroxidation. Incubation of 300-500 microL of plasma with H2O2/cupric acetate resulted in the formation of products from fatty acids (malonaldehyde, measured by thiobarbituric acid assay) and cholesterol (predominantly cholest-3,5-dien-7-one, measured by gas-liquid chromatography). In the presence of Cu2+, formation of malonaldehyde and cholest-3,5-dien-7-one increased at least 10-fold over basal values. Lipid peroxide (malonaldehyde) and cholesterol oxide concentrations after peroxidation were significantly higher (P less than 0.01) in diabetic plasma than in normal plasma. Because susceptibility to plasma peroxidation represents a balance between pro-oxidant factors and antioxidant protection, this test may be useful in determining individual susceptibility to peroxidation as influenced by nutritional and clinical status.
