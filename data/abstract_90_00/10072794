OBJECTIVE: To investigate the pathogenesis and treatment of steroid-resistant (SR) asthma. METHODS: Changes of serum levels of soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL-2R) after oral prednisone (20 mg/d) therapy were observed, and the peripheral blood T cell inhibitory effects of dexamethasone, oxymatrine and thymus-derived immunoinhibiting agents were studied in vitro by lymphocyte proliferation assay. RESULTS: After prednisone therapy, serum levels of sIL-2R were significantly decreased in steroid-sensitive (SS) asthmatics (P < 0.001) but not in SR asthmatics (P > 0.5). The inhibitory effects of dexamethasone (10(-7) mol/L) on the proliferation of T cells from SR asthmatics were significantly less than those from SS asthmatics (P < 0.002). Oxymatrine and thymus-derived immuno-inhibiting agents inhibited T cell proliferation to a similar degree between SR and SS asthmatics. CONCLUSIONS: Persistent T cell activation due to relative unresponsiveness of T cells to glucocorticoids was a feature of SR asthma. The therapeutic benefit of immuno-inhibiting agents other than glucocorticoids in the management of SR asthma deserves further investigation.
