Clostridial necrotising pneumonia is a rare complication of aspiration, bronchial tumour or foreign body, pulmonary infarction, trauma and debilitating medical conditions. Although spontaneous clostridial pneumonia has been reported previously, close scrutiny of those case reports suggests that most of the patients had a recognised predisposing cause. We report a case of true spontaneous Clostridium perfringens pneumonia complicated by septic shock, pneumothorax and pulmonary necrosis. The patient responded poorly to conventional treatment with benzylpenicillin, and although the addition of metronidazole produced dramatic resolution of the sepsis, lobectomy was required to effect cure.
