AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: To examine whether interferon-gamma destroys islet beta cells directly or indirectly through lymphocyte activation, or whether direct action of interferon-gamma on beta cells by itself induces diabetes without insulitis. METHODS: To avoid possible nonspecific breakdown of beta cells by transgenic overexpression of interferon-gamma by the insulin promoter, we generated transgenic mice expressing interferon-gamma under the control of rat glucagon promoter (RGP-IFN-gamma-Tg mice). RESULTS: The absence of insulitis in RGP-IFN-gamma-Tg mice enabled us to investigate the direct effects of paracrine interferon-gamma. In RGP-IFN-gamma-Tg mice, serum concentrations of interferon-gamma and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) were 50 and 6 times higher than those in their littermates, respectively, and glucose-responsive insulin secretion decreased to one-half the level of that in the littermates. Transgenic interferon-gamma induced remodelling of beta cells where apoptosis of many beta cells was compensated by their vigorous regeneration and diabetes did not occur in most of the RGP-IFN-gamma-Tg mice. CONCLUSION/INTERPRETATION: Interferon-gamma alone is insufficient for the complete destruction of beta cells in vivo, and factors other than interferon-gamma including activated lymphocytes or other cytokines, are necessary in addition to interferon-gamma for the development of Type I (insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus.
