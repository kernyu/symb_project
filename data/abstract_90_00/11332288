Mycobacterium leprae were isolated from a Japanese patient, and susceptibility to antileprosy drugs was examined by the mouse foot pad method. The isolate was susceptible to clofazimine and clarithromycin, and resistant to dapsone, rifampin, ofloxacin and sparfloxacin. Mutations were identified in the genes associated with resistance to these drugs. The risk of the emergence of leprosy with multidrug resistance is emphasized.
