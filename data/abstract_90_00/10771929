Ceftriaxone (RO 13-9904) has only recently been introduced in Benghazi and many parts of the word. We determined its in-vitro antibacterial activity against the primary aetiological agents of childhood meningitis in Benghazi, that included eighteen (23.3%) strains of H. influenzae, 17 (22.1%) of Str. pneumoniae and 1 (1.3%) of N. meningitidis isolated from 77 cases of acute purulent meningitis above the age of neonatal period. All strains of H. influenzae. Str. pneumoniae and N. meningitidis were sensitive to ceftriaxone and showed wide zones of inhibition by the disc diffusion technique of Kirby-Bauer. Ampicillin and chloramphenicol resistance was observed for H. influenzae (23% and 11% respectively), and Str. pneumoniae (12% and 0% respectively), in addition, 18% of strains of Str. pneumoniae showed resistance to penicillin. The broad spectrum activity of ceftriaxone has been confirmed for our locality and this finding, together with its exceptionally long half-life, excellent penetration into the C.S.F. and ease of administration (single daily dose) warrants it as the drug of choice in empherical treatment of cases of acute bacterial meningitis in children in Benghazi and in cases where resistance to ampicillin and chloramphenicol are found on subsequent testing.
