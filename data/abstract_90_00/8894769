Intensive lymphocytic infiltration of the underlying dermis occurs during cutaneous myiasis caused by larvae of the blow fly, Lucilia cuprina. To determine the effect of this infiltrate on larval growth, monoclonal antibodies (mAb) to CD4, CD8 or WC1 lymphocyte subset determinants were injected intravenously before and during experimental infection of sheep with larvae. The effect of intravenous injection of mAb to ovine interferon (IFN) gamma was also examined. The experiments were performed in 18-month-old maiden ewes with genetic resistance or susceptibility to the disease complex, bacterial dermatitis/cutaneous myiasis. mAbs induced profound depletion of CD8+ and WC1+ subpopulations from blood and skin at sites of larval growth. mAb to CD4+ gave only a moderate reduction in lymphocytes from blood or skin. mAb treatments did not modify larval growth or survival at 20 or 50 h after infection. Larval growth rates did not differ between resistant and susceptible genotypes. No evidence was found for a role of T lymphocyte subpopulations or the cytokine IFN, in modifying larval growth during the first 50 h of infection. It seems unlikely that T lymphocyte-dependent immunological effector mechanisms contribute to the lower prevalence of fly strike seen in the resistant genotype in the field.
