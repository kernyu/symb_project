The activation of bone-marrow-derived macrophages by IFN-gamma (IFN gamma) partially inhibits mouse hepatitis virus 3 (MHV3) replication only in cells from resistant A/J mice, and not in cells originating from susceptible BALB/c mice. The computer image analysis of gels obtained from 2D-SDS-PAGE of extracted proteins of IFN gamma-activated A/J or BALB/c macrophages enabled us to identify and tag several gene products that were synthesized at elevated or diminished levels. Comparisons of the patterns of non-activated and IFN gamma-activated A/J macrophages revealed 3 gene products which increased, 1 which newly appeared, 6 which decreased and 20 which disappeared upon IFN gamma activation. The protein pattern of BALB/c macrophages revealed 13 gene products which increased, 8 which decreased and 8 which disappeared in IFN gamma-activated BALB/c macrophages. Whether these proteins are involved in the induction of an antiviral state against MHV3 growth remains to be investigated. Macrophages from mice with different genetic background (A/J and BALB/c), upon IFN gamma activation, behave differently at a molecular level, and this observation is consistent with their distinct expression of antiviral state against MHV3.
