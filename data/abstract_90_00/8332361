Eight cases are reported here. Isolated Penicillin resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae strains were also resistant to Oxacillin, Erythromycin, Ampicillin, Cotrimoxazole. In five cases resistance to second generation cephalosporines (Cefaclor, Cefuroxime) also could be demonstrated. All of these multiply resistant strains retained their susceptibility to the third generation cephalosporines (Cefotaxime, Ceftriaxone). Claforan treatment resulted recovery in all of the patients.
