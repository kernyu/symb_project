A combination of esterase electrophoretic typing and analysis of the restriction fragment length polymorphism of ribosomal DNA regions (ribotyping) was used to compare 27 Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains isolated before and after two-week courses of anti-pseudomonal treatment in seven cystic fibrosis patients. A total of 12 courses of therapy were studied in which ciprofloxacin, ceftazidime, azlocillin or imipenem were used alone or in combination with tobramycin. Isolates at a count of greater than or equal to 10(6) cfu/ml of sputum were collected when there was evidence of therapeutic failure on the basis of persistence of isolates whether or not they were resistant to the antibiotic used for therapy. Emergence of resistance was observed in ten cases and failure to eradicate sensitive strains in five cases. Among the 27 isolates, eight zymotypes and five ribotypes were identified. With this typing approach, resistant post-therapy isolates were found to be identical to pre-therapy isolates in all cases but one. However, in one case an additional resistant strain was isolated after therapy besides that initially present. In all five cases in which susceptibility was still observed after treatment, pre-therapy and post-therapy isolates were indistinguishable. Using this molecular typing approach, all the strains were typable. Thus combination of esterase typing and ribotyping should improve the analysis of therapeutic failure in cystic fibrosis patients.
