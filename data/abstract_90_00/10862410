Mycobacteria are being isolated with increasing frequency from automated bronchoscope disinfection machines. This has led to misdiagnosis and nosocomial infections. In this study, we isolated Mycobacterium chelonae from a bronchoscope disinfection machine and found one strain to be resistant to 2% glutaraldehyde and sensitive to 70% ethanol. Since we began cleaning the sink of the machine with 70% ethanol, no mycobacteria has been seen throughout the machine.
