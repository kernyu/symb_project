Alveolar macrophages (AM) play an important role in antimicrobial defense mechanisms of the lung. It therefore seems reasonable to use macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) to enhance local resistance mechanisms. However, little is known about the in vivo activity of M-CSF on macrophages in various organs. We determined the effect of a single subcutaneous dose of M-CSF (10, 50, 100, and 500 ng, respectively) on the number and functional status of AM as well as of macrophages in liver and spleen of mice. Organs were investigated immunohistochemically on days 1 and 3 after injection using monoclonal antibodies specific for F4/80, Ia antigen, and MAC-1. We found a significant increase in the number of F4/80+ AM, Kupffer cells, and splenic macrophages reaching its maximum 24 h after injection of low doses (10 and 50 ng per mouse, respectively) of M-CSF and decreasing to a level seen in untreated mice at 72 h after M-CSF in liver and spleen, whereas at a dose of 50 ng per mouse the number of AM remained high. In contrast, the numbers of AM, Kupffer cells, and splenic macrophages did not increase significantly when high doses were used (500 ng). The expression of Ia antigen and MAC-1 was increased on macrophages in the spleen but not on AM or Kupffer cells. TNF-alpha was elevated in bronchoalveolar (BAL) fluid after 3 h and IL-6 at 6, 12, and 24 h after M-CSF injection in dose-dependent manner. Nitric oxide production was not increased after injection of M-CSF. Our results point to regional differences in the response of macrophages to M-CSF. These may caused by differences in the M-CSF-induced production of TNF-alpha and IL-6. These findings may be important for the therapeutic use of M-CSF in microbial infections.
