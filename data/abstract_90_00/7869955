Aeromonas spp. were isolated from gills, swimmerets, eggs, stomachs and ventral muscles of freshwater prawns (Macrobrachium malcolmsonii) available in the local fish market of Dhaka, Bangladesh. The density of Aeromonas spp. on these different body parts of the prawn samples ranged from 1.1 +/- 0.2 x 10(4) to 1.5 +/- 0.16 x 10(7) cfu per gram. The viable counts of aeromonads, fecal coliforms (FC) and Escherichia coli gradually increased in prawn samples when stored at 4 C. At -20 C, the viable counts gradually decreased and became zero on the 12th day of storage. The isolation of A. sobria (56%) was more frequent than that of A. hydrophila (31%) and A. caviae (13%). In the rabbit ileal loop (RIL) model, fluid accumulation induced by live cultures and cell-free culture filtrates of 11 strains ranged from 0.5 to 1.5 and 0.5 to 1.7 ml/cm of gut, respectively. Of 11 enterotoxigenic strains, 7 were A. sobria and 4 were A. hydrophila. Enterotoxigenicity correlated with hemolytic activity on blood agar. All enterotoxigenic strains were uniformly sensitive to chloramphenicol and gentamicin and resistant to novobiocin and vancomycin. Isolation of enterotoxigenic and antibiotic-resistant Aeromonas from these prawn samples indicates possible public health problems for their handlers as well for raw prawn consumers.
