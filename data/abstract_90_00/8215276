Pseudomonas aeruginosa ABD, which was isolated in October 1991 from blood cultures of a burn patient in Turkey, was resistant to cephalosporins, particularly ceftazidime (MIC, 512 micrograms/ml), penicillins, aztreonam, and meropenem, but not to imipenem. Cephalosporin and penicillin resistance transferred to P. aeruginosa PU21 and was associated with a beta-lactamase with a pI of 6.4 encoded by a 100-MDa plasmid designated pMLH52. Like extended-spectrum TEM and SHV beta-lactamases, this enzyme hydrolyzed penicillins and newer cephalosporins but did not hydrolyze cefoxitin or carbapenems. However, it differed from TEM and SHV derivatives in being a potent oxacillinase, and its encoding gene did not hybridize with probes to TEM and SHV genes. To characterize the enzyme, libraries of total DNA were cloned into plasmid pUC19 and were transformed into Escherichia coli DH5 alpha. Recombinant plasmids that gave ceftazidime resistance all contained a 3.65-kb BamHI fragment. Deletions from this fragment allowed the beta-lactamase gene to be located on a 1.4-kb section of DNA, which contained an open reading frame of 798 bases. This encoded a protein that was deduced to differ from PSE-2 beta-lactamase only in having serine instead of asparagine at position 143 and aspartate instead of glycine at position 157. It is concluded that the resistance of isolate ABD dependent on an extended-spectrum variant of the PSE-2 enzyme. The ability of this enzyme to cause ceftazidime resistance dependent primarily on a low Km for the compound; Vmax remained low. It is proposed that PSE-2 should be transferred to the OXA group as OXA-10 and that the new enzyme be designated OXA-11.
