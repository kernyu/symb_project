Twenty-seven episodes of bacteremia caused by Staphylococcus warneri were identified at Long Island Jewish Medical Center in New York between 1984 and 1989. Fourteen of these were thought to represent true bacteremias and 13 to represent contaminants. Of the 14 true bacteremias, 5 were in pediatric and 9 were in adult patients. Eight of 14 patients (57%) had catheter-related bacteremia and 5 of 14 had bacteremia of unknown source. There was one case of fulminant native valve S. warneri endocarditis. All cases of catheter-related bacteremia, except one, were nosocomially acquired, and 75% of these patients had an underlying immunosuppressive condition. Only 40% of patients with bacteremias of unknown source were immunocompromised, and S. warneri appeared to be noninvasive in this group. Interestingly, all five of the pediatric isolates were oxacillin susceptible, although four of five were resistant to penicillin, despite the fact these patients were hospitalized an average of 29 days. In contrast, seven of nine adult isolates were resistant to both oxacillin and penicillin. The only case of native valve S. warneri endocarditis occurred in a patient who had no known underlying valvular heart disease, but had an underlying immunosuppressive condition. Identification to species level of coagulase-negative staphylococci may lead to appreciation of the importance of bacteria such as S. warneri as human pathogens.
