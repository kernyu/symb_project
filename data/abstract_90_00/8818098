We present a case of toxic shock syndrome (TSS) induced by MRSA after sinus surgery. The patient was a 64-year-old woman who had undergone sinus surgery because of chronic sinusitis. Nine days after the surgery, she began to have sore throat, fever, and diffuse erythroderma followed by severe hypotension and renal dysfunction. Culture of sputum, nasal discharge and stool showed MRSA. Blood culture was negative. She was treated with intravenous fluids, catecholamines and antibiotics (vancomycin and fosfomycin). Continuous hemodiafiltration was started because of oliguria. Her condition improved gradually and she was discharged about a month after the onset of her illness. We should recognize that TSS can occur as a fatal complication after nasal surgery.
