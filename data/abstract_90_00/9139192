This study was performed to assess the sentinel surveillance system on malaria resistance in Cote d'Ivoire using a new method. Evaluation was based on documentation describing routine products and on activity reports obtained from the surveillance system. A qualitative approach was used to assess system design and quantitative approach to assess its operation. Degree of satisfaction with evaluation criteria was scored on a scale of 1 to 5. Score reproducibility in this study was good. Overall the system was considered as satisfactory. The strong points of the system are relevance, functions, sustainability, and data quality. The weak points are poor planning, overcentralization, and underuse of information. Correction of these weakness will require concentration by all parties at the national level involved in the surveillance system. The evaluation method used was simple, cheap and reproducible and thus could serve as an alternative approach for evaluation of sentinel surveillance systems in areas with scarce resources.
