Pneumococcal resistance has become a global issue during the past three decades. One of the major foci of pneumococcal resistance worldwide is the Asian region including Korea, Japan, and Hong Kong. Korea had not been recognized as a focus of pneumococcal resistance until 1995, when serial reports documented the alarmingly high prevalence of penicillin resistance among clinical isolates. Serial reports on penicillin resistance among pneumococcal isolates in Korea ranged from 68% to 77% as of 1995. Multidrug resistance was also noted in 34% of Korean isolates. Penicillin-binding protein profile analysis, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, ribotyping, and fingerprinting analysis of pbp genes showed that antibiotic-resistant pneumococci isolated in Korea were genetically related. Data documented the extensive spread of a resistant clone within Korea and between different countries. Besides the injudicious use of antimicrobial agents or the high prevalence of serotypes 23 and 19, the spread of a resistant clone may play an important role in the rapid increase of penicillin resistance in Korea.
