A randomized controlled study was done to determine whether initial combination therapy with zidovudine and zalcitabine or zidovudine and didanosine would delay the emergence of zidovudine-resistant virus. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1-infected patients with <300 CD4 cells/mm3 and <4 weeks of prior zidovudine therapy were randomized to zidovudine, zidovudine plus zalcitabine, or zidovudine plus didanosine. Combination therapy did not delay the emergence of zidovudine-resistant virus isolates. However, combination therapy resulted in a significant increase in CD4 cells through 72 weeks compared with zidovudine monotherapy and a greater and more sustained decline in serum HIV-1 RNA. Although this trial was not designed as a clinical end-point study, patients assigned to zidovudine plus didanosine combination therapy experienced a significant delay in time to first AIDS-defining event or death compared with those assigned to zidovudine monotherapy.
