The antibacterial 4H-4-oxoquinolizines were introduced recently to overcome bacterial resistance to fluoroquinolones. They exhibit potent antibacterial activity against Gram-positive, Gram-negative, and anaerobic organisms and are highly active against some quinolone-resistant bacteria including quinolone-resistant MRSA. Preliminary studies indicated that oxoquinolizines possess distinct activity and toxicity profiles as compared with their parent quinolones. In order to develop a potent antibacterial agent with the desired spectrum of activity, good tolerability, and balanced pharmacokinetic profile, we synthesized and evaluated a series of oxoquinolizines with various substituents at the C-8 position. Most compounds tested in this study demonstrated better activity against Gram-positive bacteria than ciprofloxacin and exhibited good susceptibility against ciprofloxacin- and methicillin-resistant S. aureus. While maintaining potent in vitro activity, several compounds showed improved in vivo efficacy over ABT-719 as indicated by the mouse protection test. As an example, the oral ED(50) values for the cis-3-amino-4-methylpiperidine analogue 3ss against S. aureus NCTC 10649M, S. pneumoniae ATCC 6303, and E. coli JUHL were 0. 8, 2.0, and 1.4 mg/kg, compared to 3.0, 10.0, and 8.3 mg/kg for ABT-719. The current study revealed that the steric and electronic environment, conformation, and absolute stereochemistry of the C-8 group are very important to the antibacterial profiles. Structural modifications of the C-8 group provide a useful means to improve the antibacterial activities, physicochemical properties, and pharmacokinetic profiles. Manipulation of the C-8 group also allows us to generate analogues with the desired spectrum of activity, such as analogues that are selective against respiratory pathogens.
