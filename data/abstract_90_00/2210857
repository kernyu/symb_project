The new fluoroquinolones have not been tested in children despite their wide spectrum of in vitro activity and efficacy, because of an observed damage to cartilage in young animals. However, in some cases they may be life-saving. We present three pediatric patients with life threatening infections in whom the fluoroquinolones were used when other antibiotics failed: A seven-year-old boy with meningitis due to multiresistant Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, a three-year-old boy with Job's syndrome with line sepsis due to Staphylococcus epidermidis and a four month-old boy with agammaglobulinemia with mixed infection due to Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter spp. All three children were cured of their infections.
