In a study of 100 patients in Ibadan between July and December 1995 to evaluate bacteraemia due to gram-negative bacilli, 64% were culture positive, 44 (68.8%) of these yielded gram-negative rods. The isolates were Klebsiella species (43.2%), Escherichia coli (27.3%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (13.6%), Proteus species (11.4%) and Bacteroides melaninogenious (4.15%) by standard bacteriological methods. Antimicrobial sensitivity results suggested ofloxacin or ceftriaxone with metronidazole as empirical antibiotic therapy.
