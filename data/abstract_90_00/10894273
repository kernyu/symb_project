OBJECTIVE: To develop and optimize a fast and quantitative recombinant strategy for evaluating the HIV-1 phenotype to protease inhibitors (PI). DESIGN AND METHODS: A non-replicative HIV-1 molecular vector (designated pdelta prodelta env) capable of expressing exogenous HIV-1 protease-encoding sequences was developed in this study. The HIV-1 protease sequences were amplified from either viral isolates or plasma samples (both from 21 HIV-1-infected individuals, 19 of whom were failing different anti-HIV-1 combination treatments) and cloned in the pdelta prodelta env backbone. The HIV-1 recombinant phenotype to PI was determined directly after transfection of viral chimeric clones by measuring protease activity and calculating a percentage sensitivity index (SI%; the ratio between the results from each clone and those from a PI-sensitive reference strain). RESULTS: The SI% values obtained from the recombinant clones paralleled the IC50 results of the viral isolates and documented different degrees of resistance and cross-resistance to PI, compatible, with few exceptions, with the respective genotype. Interestingly, an inverse correlation between SI% values and the presence of primary mutations for resistance to PI (P = 0.0038 and P = 0.0414, for indinavir and ritonavir, respectively) and a difference in SI% between samples harbouring an increasing number of mutations (indinavir, P = 0.022; ritonavir, P = 0.0466) were observed. CONCLUSION: The data substantiate the reliability of the novel strategy for a fast (5 day) quantitative evaluation of HIV-1 phenotype to PI, and indicate that this method may contribute to the understanding of mechanisms of virus resistance to PI.
