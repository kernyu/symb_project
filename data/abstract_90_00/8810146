This paper describes a quantification methodology to find out the conversion rate of RII-RIII cases from RI (Short recrudescence) cases based on parasite clearance time (PCT) and Parasite Recrudescence Time (PRT). This method will facilitate in planning and formulating an alternate drug strategy for malaria control.
