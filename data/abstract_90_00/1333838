Two R plasmids, pYFC1 and pYFC2, from Pasteurella haemolytica A1 encoding sulfonamide, streptomycin (pYFC1), and ampicillin (pYFC2) resistances have been characterized by restriction endonuclease digestions, subcloning or DNA sequencing. pYFC1 consists of 4225 bp and is 51.9% in AT content. Physical mapping indicated a highly conserved region of restriction sites among pYFC1, RSF1010, pGS05, pFM739, pHD148 and pGS03B. pYFC1 encoded a dihydropteroate synthase (29.8 kDa), and streptomycin kinase (29.6 kDa) which is homologous in nucleotide sequences or deduced amino acid sequence to that encoded by a broad-host range IncQ plasmid RSF1010. Based on the primary structure of pYFC1, the sulfonamide and streptomycin genes are derived from the same ancestor of RSF1010. pYFC2 is similar to the plasmid from P. haemolytica LNPB51 isolated in France by partial restriction enzyme mapping. pYFC1 and pYFC2 have the same size of 4.2 kbp.
