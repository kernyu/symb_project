The occurrence of surgical wound infections and/or bacteremia associated with central venous catheter use are of growing concern to all physicians who treat critically ill patients. The physician must be aware that some patients have an even greater risk for infection, such as those with multiple risk factors, those who are on central lines, or those patients who undergo multiple invasive diagnostic or therapeutic procedures. The emergence of resistant pathogens, particularly Gram-positive pathogens, is an important factor in the morbidity and mortality of hospitalized patients. In the face of this growing resistance among target organisms, the selection of the correct antimicrobial and nonpharmacologic interventions, based on correct identification and susceptibility test data, has become increasingly challenging. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and, more recently, glycopeptide-resistant enterococci and staphylococci represent a significant danger to the patient. As a consequence, earlier and more precise identification of the pathogens most frequently associated with infection is essential. The role of exacting surgical technique, infection control measures, and the appropriate use of prophylactic and therapeutic antibiotics cannot be overestimated in helping to reduce potential morbidity and mortality associated with severe surgical infection. The development of new antibiotics may help treat the difficult cases attributable to resistant Gram-positive bacteria.
