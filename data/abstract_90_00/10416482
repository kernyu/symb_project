The frequency of resistance to antibiotics among community acquired pathogens and the number of drugs to which they are resistant are increasing world wide. Antimicrobial resistance in the Netherlands is still low. Resistance to antimicrobial drugs is clearly linked to consumption of antibiotics within and outside of the hospital. Use of antibiotics in veterinary medicine may also contribute to the occurrence of antimicrobial resistance in human pathogens. Strategies to limit the spread of resistant strains should include encouraging the judicious use of antimicrobial agents. Guidelines for antibiotic therapy should be based on results derived from well designed surveillance studies.
