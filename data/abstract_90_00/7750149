Different transgenic plants of Brassica napus, Brassica nigra, Datura innoxia and Vicia narbonensis expressing the hph gene under the control of the 35s promoter were co-cultivated with mycelial material of Aspergillus niger in microcosms under sterile conditions. A significantly higher number of hygromycin B-resistant colonies of re-isolated fungi was obtained if compared with co-cultures with non-transgenic plants. The hph gene and other foreign sequences could be detected in some of the resistant strains only for a short time after selection, indicating a rapid loss of foreign DNA. A more stable transgenic strain was obtained after co-culture with transgenic plants of D. innoxia including a high number of hph copies in their genome. DNA with detected pUC sequences was prepared to transform E. coli DH5 alpha. One of the recovered plasmids is shown to include pieces of the plant-transforming vector and a foreign sequence. The 35s-regulated expression of genes is studied in A. niger.
