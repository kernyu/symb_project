The authors report a case of Campylobacter fetus subsp. fetus gastro-intestinal infection and bacteremia with poly-arthritis, mainly of the hip, in a French patient simultaneously suffering from cirrhosis of the liver. The outcome was eventually favorable, however only after a trial of ineffective pefloxacin-gentamicin therapy. The authors suggest: (i) gentamicin should not be given alone in C. fetus subsp. fetus infections, and (ii) pefloxacin should not be given if antibiotic sensitivities data are not available. The inconclusive reliability of disk diffusion tests for C. fetus subsp. fetus should be recognized.
