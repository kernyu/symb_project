Histopathology as well as bacteriology of lymph node specimen are useful diagnostic tools for tuberculous lymphadenitis. In the present study, a total of 71 cases of lymphadenitis were selected for histopathological and bacteriological studies. Only 46 patients had caseating type and 4 had non-caseating type of tuberculous lymphadenitis while 21 patients revealed non-specific chronic lymphadenitis on histopathological examination. Only 6 lymph node smears were positive for acid fast bacilli (AFB), 19 cases were positive for mycobacterial culture growth. Thus, it is not necessary that the cases which are histopathologically positive will be positive for culture as well. Therefore, both bacteriology and histopathology are complimentary diagnostic tools for tuberculous lymphadenitis.
