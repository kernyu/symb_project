The aim of this study was to determine the antifungal susceptibility of 108 Candida albicans and 23 Candida glabrata isolates obtained from female prostitutes with vulvovaginitis, a population for which available data is limited. Amphotericin B, flucytosine, and fluconazole were tested by broth microdilution, and boric acid was tested by the agar dilution method. The susceptibility patterns found in this population were the same as those in the general population. Candida glabrata required greater concentrations of boric acid for inhibition in vitro than did Candida albicans.
