The purpose of this paper is to recommend a dependable susceptibility assays for detection of resistance to metronidazole in Trichomonas vaginalis, suitable for routine use in clinical and public health care laboratories. Two different assays, the microtitre plate test based on Meingassner's technique and an alternative tube-assay, were scrutinized and compared using 10 metronidazole-resistant isolates from Czechoslovakia, other European countries and USA and 10 drug-susceptible strains isolated in Czechoslovakia. The minimal lethal concentrations of metronidazole determined for the resistant strains ranged from 25 to 317.5 micrograms.ml-1 while those of drug-susceptible from 3.1-12.5 micrograms.ml-1 metronidazole. Results obtained by both assays were highly reliable and mutually comparable. The authors recommend the microtitre plate test as a method of choice.
