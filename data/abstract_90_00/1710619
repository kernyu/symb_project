Direct selection for 12 mutations (blm) conferring hypersensitivities to lethal effects of bleomycins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae resulted in mutants exhibiting cross-hypersensitivity to ionizing radiation and hydrogen peroxide. Remaining mutations did not confer cross-hypersensitivity to radiation. All blm mutations were recessive, except codominant blm3-1, and were assigned to seven complementation groups.
