We describe a 72-year-old patient with mediastinitis caused by Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Candida albicans after median sternotomy who was successfully treated with wound closure with pectoral musculocutaneous flap and closed continuous mediastinal irrigation. The irrigation device consisted of two pairs of irrigation and suction tubes which placed upper and lower half of mediastinum respectively, in which high rate irrigation technique (200 ml/h) was employed using 0.01% of Vancomycin hydrochloride as a base agent and additional 0.1% of Povidone-iodine in early phase and 0.01% of Fluconazole in late phase. After 12-days irrigation, the drainage culture turned negative and the wound was healed and tomographically granulated. High rate irrigation with sufficient concentration of antimicrobial agents selected according to each organism sensitivity could eliminate redundant irrigation and contribute to avoid antimicrobial toxication. We experienced also another four cases (two caused by MRSA, two caused by Serratia liquefaciens) treated successfully with this technique. These results led us to believe that continuous mediastinal irrigation technique could be carried out with safe and effectiveness so far as high rate irrigation with low concentration of Povidone-iodine is employed.
