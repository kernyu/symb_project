The relationship between resistance to antibiotics on the part of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes was studied by comparing different prevalences of resistance among hospitals obtained from a recent microbiological surveillance of community-acquired respiratory tract infections. A high correlation for erythromycin resistance was found between S. pneumoniae isolates from lower respiratory tract infections and S. pyogenes isolates collected from pharyngeal swabs.
