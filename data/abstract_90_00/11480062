The authors prepared rabbit antisera against 5519 and 5951. The IgGs against type 1, type 2 fimbriae were purified from the antisera using sera absorbed with the other strain and IgG purification method. It was identified by SDS-PAGE and ELISA. This result suggested the purified proteins were the IgG against type 1 and type 2 fimbriae.
