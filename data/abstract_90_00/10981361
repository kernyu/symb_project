Treatment of C. difficile diarrhea with metronidazole or vancomycin is highly effective at relieving symptoms. The high rate of diarrhea recurrence is concerning, but fortunately most patients respond to a second course of treatment. The problem of vancomycin resistance in hospital organisms has markedly reduced usage of this agent as a first-line treatment for C. difficile diarrhea, leaving metronidazole as the mainstay of treatment in the United States where teicoplanin and fusidic acid are not marketed. It is likely that any new antimicrobial agent used to treat C. difficile will be similarly plagued by a high rate of recurrence, presumably incurred as a result of disruption of normal bowel flora. There is a need for improved treatment and prevention of this increasingly frequent and debilitating nosocomial infection. Treatments that utilize passive antibodies, immunization, nontoxigenic C. difficile, or other forms of biotherapy may hold the key to improved treatment and prevention of C. difficile disease in the future. In the meantime, it behooves all practitioners to use antimicrobials judiciously in order to prevent as many cases of C. difficile diarrhea as possible.
