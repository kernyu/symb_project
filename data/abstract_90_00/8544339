Susceptibilities of Enterococcus faecalis, Citrobacter spp., Enterobacter spp., Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Serratia spp. isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 11 hospitals during June 1991 to May 1992 to various antimicrobial agents were compared with those in the same period of previous years according to a classification, uncomplicated UTIs, complicated UTIs without indwelling catheter, and complicated UTIs with indwelling catheter. The susceptibilities of E. faecalis to cefmenoxime and amikacin has decreased. As for Citrobacter spp., Enterobacter spp., P. mirabilis and Serratia spp., which were detected very few in 1989, 1990 and 1991, their susceptibilities were not observed an obvious change. The susceptibilities of E. coli to minocycline was observed a very clear alteration, that is, in uncomplicated UTIs and complicated UTIs without indwelling catheter, the susceptibilities has decreased. However, the susceptibilities of Klebsiella spp. was not observed an obvious variation. The susceptibilities of P. aeruginosa to quinolones isolated from uncomplicated UTIs has clearly decreased. These data should be considered in clinical treatment of various urinary tract infections.
