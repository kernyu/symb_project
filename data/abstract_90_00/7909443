Leishmania parasites cause human diseases ranging from self-healing cutaneous ulcers to fatal systemic infections. In addition, many individuals become infected without developing disease. In mice the two subsets of CD4+ T cells, Th1 and Th2, have different effects on the outcome of experimental Leishmania infections. Th1 cells producing interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) mediate resistance, whereas Th2 cells producing interleukin-4 (IL-4) and IL-10 are associated with susceptibility and exacerbation. Evidence is accumulating that a Th1/Th2 dichotomy in the T-cell response to Leishmania exists also in humans, and that the balance between subsets of parasite-specific T cells may play an important regulatory role in determining the outcome of the infections.
