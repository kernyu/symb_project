The synthesis and optimization of the anti-Helicobacter pylori activity of a novel series of cephem derivatives are described. Introduction of thio-heterocyclic groups containing N- and S-atoms to the 3-position and phenyl or thienyl acetamido groups to the 7-position of the cephem nucleus dramatically improved the activity. From this series of derivatives, compound 13i was found to have extremely potent in vitro anti-H. pylori activity, superior therapeutic efficacy compared to AMPC and CAM, no cross-resistance between CAM or MNZ and low potential for causing diarrhea due to instability to beta-lactamase.
