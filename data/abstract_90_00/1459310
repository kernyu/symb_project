Studies conducted in Mizoram during 1981 to 1990 have shown areas with increasing RIII level of chloroquine resistance. These foci need urgent liquidation. Sulfalene-pyrimethamine drug combination was found suitable for treatment of P. falciparum cases in these areas with only 5.3 per cent cases showing RI level of Plasmodium response. Quinine combined with sulfalene-pyrimethamine showed 100 per cent success. Amodiaquine however was similar in response to chloroquine though the mean parasite clearance time with amodiaquine was slightly better.
