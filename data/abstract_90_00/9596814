OBJECTIVE: To evaluate rpoB gene mutation in rifampin-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis and its relationship with rifampin resistance. METHODS: Forty clinical isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis were analyzed by PCR-SSCP technique, with H37Rv reference strains as control group. RESULTS: The sensitivity of amplication products of 411bp and 258bp were found to be 5 pg/microliters, 500 organisms per milliliter and 1 pg/microliter, 500 organisms per milliliter respectively. rpoB gene belongs to genus specificity. Characteristics of SSCP graph of 258bp fragment: Ten sensitive strains were the same as H37 Rv. Thirty strains of rifampin-resistant or multidrug resistance, including rifampin, were different from H37Rv except for three strains. Positive rate was 90%, while specificity 100%. CONCLUSIONS: Results showed that PCR-SSCP technique could detect rPOB gene mutation, which might associate with rifampin resistance and be helpful to rapid detection and research of rifampin-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
