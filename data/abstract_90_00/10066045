The faecal carrier rate of vancomycin resistant enterococci (VRE) was surveyed among 616 patients in selected departments of 7 Norwegian hospitals. One Enterococcus gallinarum isolate harbouring a vanB2 element was recovered from a child with malignant disease treated with vancomycin and ceftazidime. No vancomycin resistant Enterococcus faecalis or Enterococcus faecium were detected and no VRE isolates of the VanA type were identified. The low level of VRE carriage corresponds to the limited use of glycopeptide antibiotics for human therapeutic purposes in Norway. It indicates a low risk of acquiring VRE infections in Norwegian hospitals.
