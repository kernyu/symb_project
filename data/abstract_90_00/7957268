The aim of the current five-center collaborative study was to reassess the interpretive criteria for cefaclor, loracarbef, cefprozil and cefixime previously adopted or proposed by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) for disk diffusion susceptibility tests with Haemophilus influenzae on Haemophilus Test Medium (HTM) agar. MICs and zones of inhibition were determined using NCCLS methods, HTM and two collections of strains of Haemophilus influenzae. One group of strains consisted of 118 stock organisms taken largely from various recent U.S. antibiotic resistance surveillance studies. The emphasis in this selected group of organisms was on strains that were beta-lactamase negative but ampicillin resistant (BLNAR) by some other mechanism. The second collection of test organisms consisted of 50 recent clinical isolates of Haemophilus influenzae obtained from each of the five participating study centers. This group was considered representative of the type of Haemophilus influenzae currently recovered from clinical sources in the USA. Frequency distribution assessment and error-rate bounded analysis of scattergram comparisons of MICs and zone sizes were used to develop the following zone diameters interpretive for disk diffusion susceptibility tests with Haemophilus influenzae on HTM agar: cefaclor, > or = 20 mm (susceptible, S) and < or = 16 mm (resistant, R); loracarbef, > or = 19 mm (S) and < or = 15 mm (R); and cefprozil, > 18 mm (S) and < 14 mm (R). The respective MIC correlates for all three antimicrobial agents were < or = 8 micrograms/ml (S) and 32 micrograms/ml (R).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
