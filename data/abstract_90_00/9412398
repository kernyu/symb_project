Amoxyclav (amoxycillin/potassium clavulanate, A/PC) was used in a dose of 625 mg 3 times a day in the treatment of 68 outpatients at the age of 17 to 88 years (the average age of 49 years) with slight or moderate community-acquired pneumonia. In 49 per cent of the patients the pneumonia developed at the background of concomitant chronic diseases. The positive clinical effect was observed in 94 per cent of the patients. In 76 per cent of them a short-term treatment course of 5 days was sufficient. Before the treatment 91.8 per cent of the isolates proved to be susceptible to A/PC. The pathogen eradication after completion of the treatment was stated in 72 per cent of the cases. Moderate gastrointestinal adverse reactions developed in 4 patients (6 per cent). The results demonstrated high clinical and bacteriological efficacies of A/PC and made it possible to recommend the drug as the 1st class agent for the initial empirical therapy of community-acquired pneumonia in outpatients.
