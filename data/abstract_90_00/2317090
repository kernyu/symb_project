A total of 134 samples of rectal and cloacal swabs taken from apparently healthy domestic animals that were in 43 of 76 homes located in rural Ghana were examined for Campylobacter jejuni. C. jejuni was isolated from 32.8% (44/134) of the animals. The highest isolation rate of 43.6% was from local domestic fowls, followed by goats (33.3%) and sheep (23%). This organism was not detected in the pigs, cats, and ducks. All 44 strains of this bacterium produced hydrogen sulphide and hydrolyzed hippurate; antibiogram on 24 strains showed resistance to cephalothin, cephalexin, and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim. C. jejuni biotype 2 is the prevailing strain in animals in the area studied.
