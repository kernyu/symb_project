Seventy strains of Clostridium difficile, all isolated from symptomatic patients, were found to be uniformly susceptible to ramoplanin, a new glycolipodepsipeptide antibiotic, and to four glycopeptides (vancomycin, teicoplanin, and two semisynthetic teicoplanin derivatives). Ramoplanin is recommended for further evaluation in the treatment of C. difficile-associated disease.
