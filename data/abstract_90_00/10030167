Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) is a strategy in which clinicians introduce potent combinations of antiretroviral medications early in the course of HIV infection. The intent is to suppress viral replication as completely as possible to forestall irreversible immune system damage. Antiretroviral agents fall into two major classes reverse transcriptase inhibitors and protease inhibitors. Each class interferes with viral replication at a different point in the viral life cycle. Recent research findings demonstrate clearly that antiretroviral treatment should begin as soon as the patient is willing and able to take the multidrug regimens. The best strategy for meeting the challenge of antiretroviral resistance is prevention. If you completely halt viral replication with potent therapy, the development of resistant strains is prevented.
