Long term nutritional selenium (Se) deficiency had only marginal effects on the thyroid T4 and T3 content and on the activity of the selenoenzyme type I deiodinase (5'D-I) in the thyroid gland. These findings reveal a remarkable resistance of the thyroid to Se-deficiency which may substantially contribute to the observed maintenance of T4 and T3 levels in circulating blood. In contrast to its maintained thyroidal activity, 5'D-I in peripheral tissues like liver and kidney was strongly decreased by Se-deficiency. The observed decrease of type II deiodinase (5'D-II) in the cerebral cortex of Se-deficient rats was obviously caused by the suppressing regulatory effect of elevated cortex T4 concentrations. The severalfold 5'D-II enhancement in iodine depleted animals was not abolished by additional Se-deficiency, suggesting that brain type II deiodinase is not a selenoenzyme. The role of selenium for cortex type III 5-deiodinase, which was moderately decreased in selenium as well as iodine-deficient rats, awaits definite evaluation by further studies. The different responsiveness to thyroidal and hepatic 5'D-I to Se restriction is further evidence for priorities in the selenium supply to different tissues.
