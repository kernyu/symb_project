The efficacy of thienam, a product of Merck, Sharp and Dohme (USA) composed of imipenem and cylastatin was studied in the treatment of 52 patients with surgical infection. In 48 and 4 patients the drug was used therapeutically and prophylactically respectively. When the drug was used therapeutically the recovery and improvement were observed in 41 out of 44 patients (93.2 per cent), 4 patients being excluded from the treatment group because of adverse reactions such as hyperthermia and skin eruption. When the drug was used prophylactically the recovery and improvement were stated in all the 4 patients. The pathogens were eradicated in the wound in 40 patients (91 per cent). 114 clinical isolates were tested and the imipenem resistance was detected only in 6.5 per cent of the Staphylococcus aureus strains, in 20 per cent of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains and in 50 per cent of the P. mirabilis and P. vulgaris strains. All the isolates of Escherichia coli, Enterobacter, Acinetobacter and Citrobacter were susceptible or moderately susceptible to imipenem.
