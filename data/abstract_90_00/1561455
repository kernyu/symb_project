The clinical-microbiological characteristics of 13 patients iun whom Streptococcus pneumoniae (Pneumococcus) was isolated from the peritoneum over eight and a half years in a third grade hospital are reviewed. It is noteworthy the fact that only in 7 cases primary or spontaneous peritonitis were treated; the remaining cases were secondary to perforation or genital infection in females. The presence of antibiotic resistance in pneumococcus was high and global mortality was low.
