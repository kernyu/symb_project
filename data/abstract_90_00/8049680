The mitochondrion appears to be essential for the growth of asexual, intraerythrocytic stages of Plasmodium falciparum and may thus be a suitable chemotherapeutic target. The in vitro activity of almitrine, a mitochondrial ATP synthetase inhibitor used for the treatment of hypoxemia, was compared with other mitochondrial inhibitors against chloroquine-susceptible and chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum using an isotopic semimicro drug susceptibility assay. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of almitrine (range: 2.6-19.8 microM) were within similar range of values of other mitochondrial ATP synthetase inhibitors and doxycycline, a mitochondrial protein synthesis inhibitor. Almitrine was equally active against chloroquine-susceptible and chloroquine-resistant parasites. Drug combination studies showed no interaction between chloroquine and almitrine. Our results suggest that almitrine, a clinically safe drug, may represent a lead compound with a specific target against the mitochondrial ATP synthetase which may be useful for antimalarial chemotherapy.
