The prevalence and sensitivity pattern of common bacterial isolates from clinical specimens processed over one year in the bacteriology laboratory of a teaching hospital in north-west Ethiopia was investigated. Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and other enteric Gram-negative rods were the predominant pathogens cultured. Klebsiella species were responsible for a nosocomial outbreak among children in the year. The majority of the strains, irrespective of genera, were resistant to tetracycline (> 60%), co-trimoxazole (> 55%) and chloramphenicol (> 45%). Resistance to ampicillin was seen in > 60% of isolates other than S. aureus. Sensitivity to gentamicin was high (> 89%) among S. aureus, E. coli and Pseudomonas strains. Isolates of Klebsiella, Enterobacter and Proteus were the least sensitive to the aminoglycoside. A multiplicity of antibiograms and predominance of certain multiresistant strains was observed for the prevalent species. Comparison made with reports from elsewhere in Ethiopia indicates that resistance to the commonly available (and cheaper) broad-spectrum antibiotics is a nationwide problem. A suggestion is made to enforce rational drug use before potent antibiotics are introduced under prescriber pressure.
