Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) extracted from the supersusceptible strain Pseudomonas aeruginosa Z61 were compared with LPS from other strains with varying antimicrobial susceptibilities. The presence of 4-amino-4-deoxy-arabinose (4-AraN) in P. aeruginosa Z61 LPS was confirmed by gas-liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (GLC-MS) and quantitated by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Z61 LPS (compared with wild-type strain PAO1) has reduced amounts of rhamnose and higher concentrations of hydroxy fatty acids, 4-AraN, and phosphates. 31P Nuclear magnetic resonance revealed that Z61 LPS phosphates are configured in monophosphates, phosphodiesters, pyrophosphomonoesters, and glycosidic pyrophosphodiester groups. The presence of 4-AraN in P. aeruginosa LPS did not correlate with antimicrobial resistance.
