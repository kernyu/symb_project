It has been shown that antianthrax immunity induced by the novel vaccine proposed has not only antitoxic, but also antispore character. The whole complex of antigens, namely surface spore antigens, surface antigens of cell wall and toxin components is required for the induction of strong and stable immunity against anthrax. The STI-1 vaccine strain with introduced resistance to several antibiotics seems to be promising for prophylaxis and treatment of anthrax in case of emergency, especially if antibiotic pretreatment could be expected. The technology for submerged cultivation of Bacillus anthracis vaccine strain and for the development of an anthrax vaccine to be used in human medicine is proposed on the basis of the conception of the immunogenesis.
