In 1990 the first German multicentre study on the in vitro susceptibility of Bacteroides species was completed. Employing a commercially prepared microbroth dilution assay, nine participating institutions evaluated approximately 100 consecutive isolates of Bacteroides species from relevant clinical specimens. A total of 911 strains (449 Bacteroides fragilis, 201 Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, 79 Bacteroides ovatus, 78 Bacteroides vulgatus, 77 Bacteroides distasonis, 25 Bacteroides uniformis, 2 others) were tested. Most of the isolates came from surgical patients (72%); other sources included gynaecological patients (9%) and medical patients (5%). Seventy-eight percent of the anaerobes were found in mixed culture together with at least one aerobic organism (Escherichia coli 36%, streptococci 15%, or enterococci 13%), while in 22% of the cases, the anaerobes were the only bacteria grown from the specimens. The results showed that many of the strains were potent beta-lactamase producers (as judged by resistance to amoxicillin). However, all but one of the isolates demonstrated susceptibility in vitro when clavulanic acid was added to amoxicillin or ticarcillin. At the same time, 13% of the organisms were resistant to mezlocillin, 5% to cefoxitin and 4% to clindamycin. Three strains were reported resistant to imipenem and one strain to metronidazole.
