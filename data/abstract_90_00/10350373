The optimal antibiotic control measures remain to be described and probably vary between institutions. Nevertheless, various control measures have been shown to be useful in reducing costs of therapy and total amounts of prescribing, while maintaining quality of care. More recently, interest has turned to whether antibiotic policies can reduce the spread of resistance and even reverse current high levels. Early studies indicated this was feasible, but mathematical models and the recent discovery of the role of transposons and integrons in multi-drug resistance have both cast doubt on likely future success in this area. Nevertheless, there have been some major successes in recent studies, both in the community and hospital. While cross-infection is a major impediment to control of resistance, there is little doubt that careful antibiotic prescribing can curtail the emergence and reduce the prevalence of resistance.
