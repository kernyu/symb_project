The genetic basis of trimethoprim resistance was examined in 24 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 27 Enterobacter cloacae, five Enterobacter aerogenes and nine Serratia marcescens urinary isolates from five hospitals in Greece. Analysis of the 65 isolates by serotyping and phage-typing identified 53 distinct strains. Thirty-eight isolates (15 K. pneumoniae, 19 E. cloacae, two E. aerogenes and two S. marcescens) hybridized with a probe specific for a gene encoding type II dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). Three of the K. pneumoniae and four of the E. cloacae isolates which reacted with this probe also hybridized with probes specific for type I DHFR and transposon Tn7. Two E. cloacae isolates hybridized only with the probe for type I DHFR, while a further three isolates hybridized only with the type I DHFR and Tn7 probes. None of the isolates hybridized with a probe for type V DHFR. The plasmids in transconjugants derived from 40 isolates were analysed by digestion with restriction enzymes and Southern blotting. Eighteen (45%) of the donors (12 K. pneumoniae and 6 E. cloacae) produced transconjugants containing plasmids of about 95 kb in size, while transconjugants from the other donors had plasmids in the range 100-185 kb. Of the 18 transconjugants containing a 95 kb plasmid, 15 had similar restriction endonuclease digest patterns, although they varied in terms of the range of antimicrobial resistances which they encoded. When EcoRI digests of these 15 plasmids were hybridized with the type II DHFR probe, a 23 kb common band reacted with the probe.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
