One hundred penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (PRSP) strains from Asia, Europe, and North America were analyzed using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis; fingerprinting of penicillin binding protein (pbp) genes; and BOX PCR. Results show that six PFGE patterns (three patterns comprising > or = 2 serotypes) were found widespread and accounted for 64 of the 100 PRSP strains.
