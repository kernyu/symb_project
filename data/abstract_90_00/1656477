The transposon Tn7 codes for a trimethoprim resistance and for a streptomycin/spectinomycin resistance function of the bacterial host cells. Cloning of a restriction fragment of Tn7 into the vector plasmid pUC19 reveals the presence in Tn7 of an additional potential resistance determinant. A streptothricin resistance gene, which appears cryptic in the original Tn7 context becomes activated in the recombinant plasmid upon supplying the promoter function of the lacZ system of pUC19. These results together with previously published sequence data further disclose the modular character in the resistance gene regions of Tn7-like transposons.
