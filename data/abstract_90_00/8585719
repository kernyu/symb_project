Increased levels of production of penicillin-binding protein PBP 4 correlated with in vitro acquired intrinsic beta-lactam resistance in a mutant derived from a susceptible strain of Staphylococcus aureus, strain SG511 Berlin. Truncation of the PBP 4 C-terminal membrane anchor abolished the PBP 4 content of cell membrane preparations as well as the resistance phenotype. A single nucleotide change and a 90-nucleotide deletion, comprising a 14-nucleotide inverted repeat in the noncoding pbp4 gene promoter proximal region, were the only sequence differences between the resistant mutant and the susceptible parent. These mutations were thought to be responsible for the observed overproduction of PBP 4 in the intrinsically beta-lactam-resistant mutant. The pbp4 gene was flanked upstream by the open reading frame abcA, coding for an ATP-binding cassette transporter-like protein showing similarities to eukaryotic multidrug transporters and downstream by a glycerol 3-phosphate cytidyltransferase (tagD)-like open reading frame presumably involved in teichoic acid synthesis. The abcA-pbp4-tagD gene cluster was located in the SmaI-D fragment in the S. aureus 8325 chromosome in close proximity to the RNA polymerase gene rpoB.
