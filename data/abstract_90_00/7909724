Cultured P388/VCR mouse lymphoma cells resistant to vincristine (VCR) and to 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BUdR) and deficient in thymidine kinase (TK-) were fused with P388/DAG cells resistant to 1.2:5,6-dianhydrogalactitol (DAG), an anticancer alkylating agent, and to 6-thioguanine (6-TG) and deficient in hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl-transferase (HPRT-). The hybrid cells expressed multidrug resistance (MDR), i.e., resistance to VCR and cross-resistance to Adriamycin (ADM) and actinomycin D (Act. D), in a dominant manner. The presence of glycoprotein p170, the MDR gene product, was detected in the hybrid cells. Resistance to DAG was also expressed dominantly, whereas cross-resistance to dibromodulcitol (DBD), a chemically related anticancer drug, was slight.
