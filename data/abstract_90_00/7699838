In vitro studies with a new imidazole antifungal agent lanoconazole (LCZ) were carried out to confirm its fungicidal property of the anti-dermatophytic activity and unlikeliness of dermatophytes to acquire secondary resistance to this drug. Minimal cidal concentration (MCC) values of LCZ against 6 strains each of Trichophyton mentagrophytes and T. rubrum determined by the cellophane membrane method were in a range of 0.063 to 0.5 micrograms/ml, and much lower than those of bifonazole (16-32 micrograms/ml). The LCZ-sensitivity of both of the two testing strains of T. mentagrophytes did not decrease to less than one-fourth of the initial level during 15 subcultures on LCZ-containing agar. These results suggest that LCZ potently inhibits dermatophytes in a fungicidal manner and that secondary resistance to LCZ is not easily developed in the dermatophytes tested.
