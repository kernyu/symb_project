Cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis is a common ocular complication of immunosuppression. The management of CMV retinitis has been continuously evolving over the last decade. The mainstay of therapy remains ganciclovir and foscarnet. However, increasing resistance and ongoing toxicities to these agents remain a challenge. Additional frequently utilised agents include cidofovir and fomivirsen. The advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has allowed the restoration of immunocompetency to many patients previously challenged by CMV infection. In some circumstances, HAART has even eliminated the need for ongoing antiviral therapy. This paper reviews the current treatment modalities, including their toxicities and dosing recommendations.
