Salicylic acid (SA) plays an important role in plant disease resistance. Inoculation of tobacco leaves with incompatible pathogens triggers the biosynthesis of SA which accumulates primarily as the SA 2-O-beta-D-glucoside (SAG) and glucosyl salicylate (GS). The tobacco UDP-glucose:salicylic acid glucosyltransferase (SA GTase) capable of forming both SAG and GS was purified, characterized, and partially sequenced. It has an apparent molecular mass of 48 kDa, a pH optimum of 7.0, and an isoelectric point at pH 4.4. UDP-glucose was the sole sugar donor for the enzyme. However, SA and several phenolics served as glucose acceptors. The apparent K(m) values for UDP-glucose and SA were 0.27 and 1-2 mM, respectively. Zn(2+) and UDP inhibited its activity. The corresponding cDNA clone which encoded a protein of 459 amino acids was isolated from an SA-induced tobacco cDNA library and overexpressed in Escherichia coli. The recombinant protein catalyzed the formation of SAG and GS, and exhibited a broad specificity to simple phenolics, similar to that of the purified enzyme. Northern blot analysis showed that the SA GTase mRNA was induced both by SA and incompatible pathogens. The rapid induction timing of the mRNA by SA indicates that it belongs to the early SA response genes.
