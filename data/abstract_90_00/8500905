Four clones of the yeast Candida albicans, isolated on the basis of their tolerance to clotrimazole, were compared with their parental strains in terms of growth, morphology, virulence, and cell surface complement receptor activity. In a newly described synthetic medium, these clones, designated C1, C2, N, and P, produced germ tubes or pseudohyphae, but no true hyphae, in a pattern which was specific for each strain. The growth of each clone at 37 degrees C, under conditions which favor the filamentous growth form of the organism, was equal to that of the parental strain (H12). The pathogenicity of each clone was tested in an intravenous mouse model. None of the mice infected with the tolerant clones but all of the mice infected with H12 developed severe renal candidiasis after infection with 1.4 x 10(6) to 2.0 x 10(6) CFU/ml. The number of CFU of each clone from the mouse kidney was reduced about 3 or 4 orders of magnitude in comparison with the wild type. As a correlate, we measured the complement receptor activity (CR2 and CR3) of each clone. The C3 ligands, iC3b and C3d, were conjugated to sheep erythrocytes (E) sensitized with antibody (A) to the erythrocytes (EA). We found that all tolerant clones showed reduced recognition of C3d-bearing sheep erythrocytes (EAC3d) in rosetting assays. Clone P showed more than an 80% reduction in rosetting of EAC3d in comparison with H12 cells. In contrast, recognition of iC3b (EAiC3b) by each of the clones was similar to that by H12 cells. When dithiothreitol extracts of clone P and H12 were compared by immunoblot, both quantitative and qualitative differences in reactivities were observed with antibodies specific for the Candida C3d receptor and with antiserum from a patient with chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis.
