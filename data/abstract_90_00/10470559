Antimicrobial resistance has emerged among the three major bacterial pathogens causing meningitis. Chloramphenicol resistance in the meningococcus recently has been described, and although intermediate penicillin resistance is common in some countries, the clinical importance of penicillin resistance in the meningococcus has yet to be established. Beta-lactamase-producing Haemophilus influenzae are relatively common, and chloramphenicol resistance is emerging. Third-generation cephalosporins are required to treat meningitis caused by these resistant strains. Pneumococcus resistance to penicillin and to chloramphenicol is widespread, and resistance to third-generation cephalosporins is found in many parts of the world. Correct management of these strains includes the addition of vancomycin or rifampin to therapy with third-generation cephalosporins.
