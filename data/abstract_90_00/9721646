Four different species of coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) were isolated from polluted waters in Fez, Morocco and found to be Staphylococcus simulans, Staph. lenticus, Staph. hyicus and Staph. xylosus. Eight isolates belonging to these four species were analysed for their plasmid content. Southern blot hybridizations were performed to define the resistance determinants of the plasmids harboured by these species. These determinants were found to be carried mainly by Class I staphylococcal plasmids (1-5 kb). A plasmid (4.3 kb) carrying a tetracycline resistance gene was present in five isolates from all identified species. Plasmids carrying a chloramphenicol resistance gene were more frequently encountered and found to be of different sizes. Plasmids carrying erythromycin, neomycin, and streptomycin resistance genes were less frequent and were the same size. The results indicate that the occurrence of multi-resistant CNS in polluted waters may constitute a reservoir for disseminating antibiotic-resistance into the community.
