Mediastinitis following cardiac surgery occurs frequently in association with high mortality and morbidity. Patient was a 6-year-old boy suffering from Sotos syndrome with secundum type of ASD. He was operated upon to repair ASD. Following the surgery, he suffered from MRSA mediastinitis and osteomyelitis of the sternum. Routine method of closed irrigation after reopening of the sternal wound was ineffective. Patient recovered following aggressive debridement repeatedly, open drainage and topical irrigation with vancomycin. This appears to be a useful method to treat MRSA mediastinitis of the sternum.
