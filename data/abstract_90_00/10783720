DANMAP is a Danish programme for integrated monitoring of and research on antimicrobial resistance in bacteria from food animals, food and humans. The paper describes how bacteria from broilers, pigs, and cattle are collected, as well as the procedures for data handling and presentation of results. The bacteria from animals include certain pathogens, selected so that they are representative for submissions to Danish diagnostic laboratories, as well as zoonotic bacteria (Campylobacter, Salmonella and Yersinia) and indicator bacteria (E. coli, E. faecium and E. faecalis), from samples collected at abattoirs. The latter samples are selected so that they are representative of the respective animal populations. Therefore, the apparent prevalence of antimicrobial resistance in the populations may be calculated. The isolates are identified to species level and the results of susceptibility testing are stored as continuous variables. All isolates are maintained in a strain collection so that they are available for subsequent research projects. The data handling facilities makes it possible to present results as percent resistant isolates or as the apparent prevalence of resistance in the population, or alternatively as graphical distributions of mm inhibition zones or MIC values. Computer routines have been established that make it possible to detect specific phenotypic expressions of resistance that may be of particular interest.
