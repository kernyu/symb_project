We assessed the antimicrobial susceptibilities of 59 penicillin-intermediate or penicillin-resistant pneumococci. All strains were susceptible to vancomycin and rifampicin. The frequency of strains with decreased susceptibility to cefotaxime, chloramphenicol, imipenem and meropenem was 15, 31, 47 and 49% respectively. The high percentage of penicillin-intermediate or penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae with decreased susceptibility to third-generation cephalosporins, chloramphenicol and carbapenems limits the therapeutic options for the treatment of invasive pneumococcal infections and particularly of meningitis.
