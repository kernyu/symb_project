While meropenem MICs were strongly influenced by the presence or absence of the MexAB-OprM efflux pump in both OprD-proficient and -deficient strain backgrounds, MICs of imipenem and of ER-35786 remained unchanged, demonstrating that meropenem is a substrate of MexAB-OprM but not imipenem and ER-35786. In vitro, all three carbapenems selected loss of OprD as a first mechanism of resistance. However, in an OprD-deficient background, meropenem was able to select MexAB-OprM overproducers as a secondary resistance mechanism, while ER-35786 selected a mutant cross-resistant to sparfloxacin and cefpirome.
