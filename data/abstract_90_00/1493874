Individual schistosomes of an hycanthone/oxamniquine-sensitive strain were crossed with individual schistosomes of the opposite sex and belonging either to the same sensitive population or to a different strain which exhibited high resistance to the two drugs. Schistosome crosses were performed by transfer of single worm pairs into the mesenteric veins of mice and the drug sensitivity/resistance of individual progeny worms was assessed using an in vitro test. Drug resistance behaved as an autosomal recessive trait, as shown by the results of the F1 and F2 generation and of the backcrosses. Drug-resistant worms appeared to be slightly less viable than their sensitive counterpart at all stages of the life cycle. The results are relevant for an interpretation of drug resistance and drug mechanisms and the approach used in this study may be applicable to different genetic markers in schistosomes.
