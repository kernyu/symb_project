Vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) often contaminate the hospital environment. We examined the activity of commonly used disinfectants against eight strains of VRE, using a quantitative suspension test method. Isopropyl alcohol and sodium hypochlorite were highly effective. Hydrogen peroxide was ineffective for all strains. After 10 minutes of incubation (the manufactures' recommended time of exposure), three phenolic and three quaternary ammonium compounds also were highly effective. After 3 minutes of exposure, however, occasional failures did occur. With the exception of 3% hydrogen peroxide, most disinfectants appear to be active against VRE.
