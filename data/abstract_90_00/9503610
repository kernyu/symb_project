The distribution of the antiseptic-resistance genes qacE and qacE delta 1 was studied in a large number of Gram-negative bacteria by a method that included the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). A total of 117 strains of Gram-negative bacteria, isolated from clinical or environmental sources, was used in this analysis. We demonstrated the presence of these genes in 48 of 78 strains of Pseudomonas, in 20 of 26 strains of Vibrio, and in four of 13 strains of other species. These results indicate that the antiseptic-resistance genes are present in a broad range of species of Gram-negative bacteria.
