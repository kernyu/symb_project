BACKGROUND: Multi-drug regimens are generally required to reliably cure H. pylori infection. We previously demonstrated that a 2-week three-times-a-day regimen of amoxycillin and clarithromycin was effective against H. pylori infection. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy and side-effects of a 1-week twice-daily dosing schedule for the treatment of H. pylori infection. METHODS: We studied the efficacy of 1-week of therapy with 20 mg of omeprazole, 1 g of amoxycillin and 250 mg of clarithromycin, all twice daily H. pylori status was determined at entry and 4 or more weeks after completing antimicrobial therapy using histology (Genta stain) and culture. RESULTS: Thirty-one patients with documented peptic ulcer disease and H. pylori infection were treated. The H. pylori infection was cured in 24 (77%, 95% CI = 58-90%) (intention-to-treat). In a per protocol analysis the cure rate was 23 of 29 patients (79%, 95% CI = 60-92%). One patient took only 43% of the study drugs and another withdrew following development of an anaphylactic reaction to study medication. Mild side-effects were reported by 16% including diarrhoea, headache and altered taste. Compliance averaged 95%. Pretreatment clarithromycin resistance averaged 5% and had not been acquired by any strains post-therapy. CONCLUSION: This combination of omeprazole, amoxycillin and low-dose clarithromycin resulted in a relatively low cure rate even in patients with clarithromycin-sensitive isolates. Large comparative studies will be needed to define the optimal duration, dose and dosing interval if this combination of drugs is to become competitive.
