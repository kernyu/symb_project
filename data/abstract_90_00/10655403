The susceptibility of 115 Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex clinical isolates to isoniazid, streptomycin, ethambutol, and rifampin was assessed by the MB/BacT and BACTEC 460TB systems. The correlation between the two tests was 98.3% for isoniazid, 100% for streptomycin and rifampin, and 95.8% for ethambutol. Turnaround times for antimicrobial susceptibility testing ranged from 5 to 11 days (median, 8.5 days) for MB/BacT and from 4 to 8 days (median, 6 days) for BACTEC 460TB.
