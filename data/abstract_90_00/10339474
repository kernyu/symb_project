Leukemic blast cells express the CD33 antigen in most patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), but this antigen is not expressed by hematopoietic stem cells. We conducted a study to determine whether normal hematopoiesis could be restored in patients with AML by selective ablation of cells expressing the CD33 antigen. In a dose escalation study, 40 patients with relapsed or refractory CD33(+) AML were treated with an immunoconjugate (CMA-676) consisting of humanized anti-CD33 antibody linked to the potent antitumor antibiotic calicheamicin. The capacity of leukemic cells to efflux 3, 3'-diethyloxacarbocyanine iodide (DiOC2) was used to estimate pretreatment functional drug resistance. Leukemia was eliminated from the blood and marrow of 8 (20%) of the 40 patients; blood counts returned to normal in three (8%) patients. A high rate of clinical response was observed in leukemias characterized by low dye efflux in vitro. Infusions of CMA-676 were generally well tolerated, and a postinfusion syndrome of fever and chills was the most common toxic effect. Two patients who were treated at the highest dose level (9 mg/m2) were neutropenic >5 weeks after the last dose of CMA-676. These results show that an immunoconjugate targeted to CD33 can selectively ablate malignant hematopoiesis in some patients with AML.
