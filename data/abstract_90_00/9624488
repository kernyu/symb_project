The antifungal activity of the nucleoside analog 3'-deoxyadenosine (cordycepin) was studied in a murine model of invasive candidiasis. When protected from deamination by either deoxycoformycin or coformycin, both of which are adenosine deaminase inhibitors, cordycepin exhibited potent antifungal efficacy, as demonstrated by prolongation of survival and a decrease in CFU in the kidneys of mice treated with cordycepin plus an adenosine deaminase inhibitor. The antifungal effect was seen with three different Candida isolates: Candida albicans 64, a relatively fluconazole-resistant clinical isolate of C. albicans (MIC, 16 micrograms/ml), and the fluconazole-resistant Candida krusei. Cordycepin and related compounds may provide another avenue for the discovery of clinically useful antifungal drugs.
