Strategic medication in breeding flocks of domestic fowl (Gallus gallus), using antimicrobial treatment followed by competitive exclusion, was evaluated in 13 trials between February and September 1993. In each trial, the flock had been confirmed as naturally infected with Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis and the effect of treatment was determined on salmonella isolation from tissues. Of 11 trials where enrofloxacin was used, a long-term reduction of salmonella was observed in two and a short-term reduction was measured in birds from another five trials. Salmonella Enteritidis was isolated from birds after treatment in four other trials with enrofloxacin and in two trials of medication with amoxycillin. After treatment with enrofloxacin significant reductions were found in the prevalence of 5. Enteritidis in tissues from birds, and in levels and prevalence of salmonellas in their environment. No salmonella was identified in statutory meconium samples taken from the hatched chicks derived from the flocks after treatment. The programme of antibiotic treatment and competitive exclusion offers an alternative to slaughter, but the approach must be part of a co-ordinated programme which will effect a decrease in the prevalence of 5. Enteritidis over time by contemporary use of disease security measures. The risk of development of antimicrobial resistance is also discussed.
