The pharmacological agent U18666A (3-beta-[2-(diethylamino)ethoxy]androst-5-en-17-one inhibits the intracellular transport of low density lipoprotein (LDL)-derived cholesterol in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. LDL-derived cholesterol accumulates in the lysosomes of U18666A-treated cells causing delayed LDL-mediated regulation of cellular cholesterol metabolism and impaired movement of LDL-derived cholesterol to other cell membranes. As a result of impaired LDL-derived cholesterol transport, LDL-dependent growth of CHO cells is also inhibited by U18666A. By selecting for cell growth in the presence of U18666A, we have identified a CHO cell line, designated U18R, that is resistant to U18666A-inhibition of LDL-derived cholesterol trafficking. When compared to parental CHO cells, U18R cells are relatively resistant to U18666A inhibition of LDL-derived cholesterol transport as well as LDL-mediated regulation of cellular cholesterol metabolism. In cell fusion experiments, the U18666A resistance observed in U18R cells displays a dominant phenotype. Identification of the U18666A-resistant factor may provide important insights toward the understanding of intracellular LDL-derived cholesterol regulation and trafficking.
