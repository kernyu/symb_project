Materials from 1134 patients with various surgical infections were tested. From the materials collected from purulent inflammatory foci 2137 cultures were isolated. Many of them belonged to Micrococcaceae (63.7 per cent). Cultures belonging to Enterobacteriaceae and Streptococcaceae were isolated from 50.9 and 25.2 per cent of the patients respectively. Isolates belonging to other families were less frequent: diphtheroids were isolated from 13.3 per cent of the patients and Pseudomonas spp. were isolated from 10.6 per cent of the patients. The majority of the isolates of diverse taxons were sensitive to gentamicin (73 to 98.4 per cent). As the second active antibiotic the following should be indicated: fusidin, active against staphylococci (S. epidermidis and S. aureus, 70.5 and 83.3 per cent respectively); ristomycin, active against micrococci and diphtheroids (75.3 and 79.1 per cent respectively); ampicillin, active against S. faecalis (61.3 per cent); polymyxin, active against the trib microbes Escherichia, Klebsiella and Pseudomonas (75.5, 64.3 and 71.4 per cent respectively). No second antibiotic active against a significant percentage of various species of Proteus, fecal alkali forming bacteria, and A. calcoaceticus was stated. Sporulating aerobes were sensitive to the majority of the antibiotics.
