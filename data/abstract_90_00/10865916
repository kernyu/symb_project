Immunocompromised patients are at risk of contracting serious fungal infections. The emergence of acquired resistance to azole treatment by opportunistic fungal organisms is increasing and poses a major therapeutic challenge. Treatment of some deep cutaneous and subcutaneous mycoses remains unresolved, relapses are frequent, lack of tolerability of the antifungal drugs becomes an obstacle, and, unfortunately, surgery is, in some cases, the last option. The development of allylamine antifungals, of which terbinafine is the most effective to date, may help to resolve this situation. In vitro, terbinafine is highly active against a broad spectrum of pathogenic fungi. Clinical studies have shown that terbinafine is effective in the treatment of both cutaneous and lymphocutaneous sporotrichosis, and in several patterns of disseminated and refractory aspergillosis. Patients with chromoblastomycosis, and other mycoses (phaeohyphomycosis, maduromycosis, and mucormycosis) have also been successfully treated with terbinafine. Old World cutaneous leishmaniasis, a parasitic disease, has also been treated with terbinafine. These results suggest that the therapeutic potential of terbinafine extends well beyond its currently licensed applications to include a range of serious and life-threatening subcutaneous and systemic mycoses.
