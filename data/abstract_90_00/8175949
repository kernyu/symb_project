The efficacy of several antibiotic treatments to eliminate mycoplasma from Vero cells contaminated chronically with Mycoplasma orale II were tested. Minocyclin, Kanamycin, Tylosine and Roxitromycin, at non cytotoxic concentrations, were assayed alone or in different combinations. Mycoplasma contamination was effectively eradicated without recurrence once the following regimen was applied: Incubation of contaminated cells with Tylosine (250 micrograms/ml) for 12 days followed by incubation with Minocycline (5 micrograms/ml) for 10 days. This treatment was not deleterious for cell growth, it was effective after only one application and it was successful to eradicate mycoplasma from other contaminated eukaryotic continuous cell lines.
