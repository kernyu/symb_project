To study the development and potential mechanisms of antifungal resistance in relation to antifungal exposure, reversible fluconazole resistance was examined in vitro. Candida albicans ATCC 36082 blastospores were passed in liquid yeast nitrogen base medium containing either 4, 8, 16, or 128 micrograms of fluconazole per ml, and susceptibility testing was performed after each passage. High-level fluconazole resistance (50% inhibitory concentration, > 256 micrograms/ml) developed in the isolates after serial passage in medium containing 8, 16, or 128 micrograms of fluconazole per ml, but not in isolates passed in 4 micrograms of fluconazole per ml. Reduced susceptibility was noted within four to seven passages, which was equivalent to 14 to 19 days of exposure to the drug. However, all isolates returned to the susceptible phenotype after 8 to 15 passages in medium lacking the drug; thus, fluconazole resistance was reversible in vitro. In vivo, organisms retained the resistant phenotype after a single passage in the rabbit model of infective endocarditis. Restriction digest profiles and karyotypic analysis of the parent strain and selected fluconazole-resistant and -susceptible isolates from each group were identical. Investigations into the molecular mechanisms of this reversible resistance failed to reveal increased accumulation of mRNA for 14 alpha-demethylase, the target enzyme for fluconazole, or for the candidal multidrug transporters CDR1 and BENr. This process of continuous in vitro exposure to antifungal drug may be useful as a model for studying the effects of different antifungal agents and dosing regimens on the development of resistance and for defining the mechanism(s) of reversible resistance.
