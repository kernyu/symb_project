Bayesian analysis using a virus dynamics model is demonstrated to facilitate hypothesis testing of patterns in clinical time-series. Our Markov chain Monte Carlo implementation demonstrates that the viraemia time-series observed in two sets of hepatitis B patients on antiviral (lamivudine) therapy, chronic carriers and liver transplant patients, are significantly different, overcoming clinical trial design differences that question the validity of non-parametric tests. We show that lamivudine-resistant mutants grow faster in transplant patients than in chronic carriers, which probably explains the differences in emergence times and failure rates between these two sets of patients. Incorporation of dynamic models into Bayesian parameter analysis is of general applicability in medical statistics.
