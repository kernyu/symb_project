The beta-hemolytic group G Streptococcus clinical isolate BM2721 was resistant to high levels of aminoglycosides by synthesis of AAC(6')-APH(2"), APH(3')-III, and ANT(6) modifying enzymes. The corresponding genes were found to be adjacent as the result of a recombination event between Tn4001 and Tn5405, two transposons originating in staphylococci.
