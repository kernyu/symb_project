The method of total DNA restriction finger prints was applied to the study of Streptomyces monomycini INA 1465 producing monomycin, Streptomyces kanamyceticus INA K-13 producing kanamycin and strain 344 isolated after fusion of the protoplasts of strain 1465 and K-13, which produced albofungin and chloralbofungin, aminoglycoside antibiotics. For preparing the finger prints of the strains splitting by endonucleases BamHI, PstI, PvuII, and BgIII was used. The finger prints showed that strain 344 was related to the strain of S. monomycini and markedly differed from the strain of S. kanamyceticus. Strain 344 was likely to result from reconstruction (probably 20-kb deletion) of the genome of S. monomycini INA 1465 induced by the preparation and regeneration of its protoplasts. The reconstruction could affect the genome area with localization of the genes involved in monomycin biosynthesis and monomycin resistance genes.
