In the prostate gland of adult mammals, most epithelial cells are in a state of proliferative quiescence. Androgens regulate this effect by inducing cell cycle arrest in the G(0)/G(1) phase. Potential mediators of this androgen-induced proliferative shutoff were identified by means of subtracted cDNA libraries. The expression pattern of one of these sequences, AS3, strongly correlated with the expression of the androgen-induced proliferative shutoff both temporally and dosewise. The AS3 gene is located on chromosome 13 q12.3, in close proximity to the BRCA2 gene. The loss of chromosomal regions where AS3 alleles are located correlates with various human cancers, including prostate. The biological effect of AS3 was tested in two stable cell lines, one expressing sense and another expressing antisense AS3 constructs, both under tetracycline regulation. S9 cells were obtained by retroviral infection with virions containing a tetracycline-regulated sense AS3 construct. In these cells, sense AS3 was negatively regulated by tetracycline. Tetracycline withdrawal increased the expression of AS3 mRNA and protein. The expression of tetracycline-regulated AS3 resulted in inhibition of cell proliferation. A4 cells were obtained by retroviral infection with virions containing a tetracycline-regulated antisense AS3 construct. Vector-driven expression of antisense-AS3 blocked the induction of androgen-induced endogenous AS3 mRNA and blocked the inhibitory effect of androgens on cell proliferation. Tetracycline-regulated expression of the empty vector control had no effect on cell proliferation. These experiments strongly suggest that AS3 is a mediator of the androgen-induced proliferative shutoff.
