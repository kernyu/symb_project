The gene (ERG1) encoding squalene epoxidase (ERG) from Saccharomyces cerevisiae was cloned. It was isolated from a gene library, prepared from an allylamine-resistant (AlR) S. cerevisiae mutant, by screening transformants in a sensitive strain for AlR colonies. The ERG tested in a cell-free extract from one of these transformants proved to be resistant to the Al derivative, terbinafine. From this result, we concluded that the recombinant plasmid in the transformant carried an allelic form of the ERG1 gene. The nucleotide sequence showed the presence of one open reading frame coding for a 55,190-Da peptide of 496 amino acids. Southern hybridization experiments allowed us to localize the ERG1 gene on yeast chromosome 15.
