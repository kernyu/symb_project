OBJECTIVE: Use gene disrupted mice to examine the possible role of secretory antibody on resistance to re-exposure to pulmonary tuberculosis. DESIGN: Mice deficient in B cells due to targeted gene disruption were infected by aerosol exposure with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. A further set were identically exposed then given isoniazid to clear the infection and establish a state of memory immunity. RESULTS: Control of the aerosol infection and generation of gamma interferon proceeded in a similar manner in both naive and memory immune mice, regardless of B cell deficiency. CONCLUSIONS: The absence of antibody responses did not affect the course of infection, thus confirming the classical literature that antibody plays no significant protective role.
