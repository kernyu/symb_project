The DNA fragments of 28 distinct isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) originating from different hospitals in Warsaw and Lodz, were studied. They were obtained by cleavage with restriction endonuclease SmaI and subsequently analysed by pulsed-field electrophoresis. Sixteen different patterns were seen and clusters of related strains were clearly distinguishable. Minor differences in fragment patterns within these clusters and among epidemiologically related strains, revealed genomic rearrangements in the course of clonal dissemination of particular strains. The isolates were also checked for the expression of methicillin resistance. Isolates with heterogenous and homogeneous phenotypes, fell into clearly distinct clusters and thus formed two clonally related MRSA strains. Differences were also seen with phage and biochemical typing, and antimicrobial resistance patterns.
