Mutations conferring resistance to erythromycin or clarithromycin in Helicobacter pylori were studied. Mutation A2142G was consistently associated with clarithromycin MIC of > 256 micrograms/ml, whereas mutants carrying A2143G had MICs ranging from < or = 0.016 to > 256 micrograms/ml, suggesting that additional factors account for the observed multiple levels of resistance to clarithromycin.
