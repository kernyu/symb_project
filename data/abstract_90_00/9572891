A series of 3-descladinosyl-2,3-anhydro-6-O-methylerythromycin A 11, 12-cyclic carbazate analogues was prepared and evaluated for antibacterial activity. These 2,3-anhydro macrolides were found to be potent antibacterial agents in vitro against macrolide-susceptible organisms including Staphylococcus aureus 6538P, Streptococcus pyogenes EES61, and Streptococcuspneumoniae ATCC6303. These compounds were also very active against some organisms that show macrolide resistance (S. aureus A5177, S. pyogenes PIU2584, and S. pneumoniae 5649). The compounds generally showed poor activity against organisms with constitutive MLS resistance. Selected compounds were evaluated in vivo in mouse protection studies. Although most of the compounds tested in vivo showed poor efficacy, two compounds, 38 and 57, were more active than clarithromycin against S. pneumoniae ATCC6303.
