In 1993 a representative sample of dentists in the Netherlands was questioned on the use of antibiotics in the treatment of periodontitis. It was found dat 50% of the general practitioners had a positive attitude, 15% a negative one and 35% had an indifferent attitude towards the use of antibiotics in periodontal treatment. Almost 40% of them indicated the prescription of antibiotics for periodontal reasons in the previous year. Most of the dentists (71%) prescribed a combination of metronidazole and amoxicillin. The average prescription frequency in 1992 was 18 times. The prescription frequency and the choice of a combination of metronidazole and a broad spectrum penicillin in the treatment of periodontitis is discussed, emphasizing the importance of the traditional mechanical therapy, the disturbance of the colonization resistance by means of antibiotics and the worldwide concern about the usage of antibiotics.
