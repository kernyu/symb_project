Viral resistance limits the value of drugs that act through competitive inhibition of HIV reverse transcriptase (RT). Thus, the emphasis of current research is on agents with other mechanisms. The possibilities include noncompetitive RT inhibitors, drugs against an entirely different enzyme--HIV proteinase, and measures to enhance immunity, either globally or against HIV specifically.
