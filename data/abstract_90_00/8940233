Nasopharyngeal carriage of Streptococcus pneumoniae was studied in 162 healthy infants at ages 2, 4, 6, 7, 12, and 13 months and in an additional 352 healthy children at ages 12, 15, 18, 21, and 24 months. Carriage was 26%, 39%, and 62% at 2, 12, and 24 months, respectively, and the respective resistance to > or = 1 antibiotic was 11%, 19%, and 27%. The presence of an older sibling or antibiotic treatment during the month preceding the culture was associated with carriage of resistant pneumococci in infants, whereas attendance at large day care centers was associated with carriage during the second year of life. Antibiotic resistance was detected in all 7 serotypes included in the candidate pediatric conjugate vaccines and was significantly more prevalent among vaccine-type pneumococci than among non-vaccine-type pneumococci. The use of conjugate vaccines may reduce the spread of resistant pneumococci.
