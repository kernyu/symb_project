The cytotoxicity of ara-C derives from an inhibition of DNA synthesis after incorporation of ara-CTP into DNA. The rate of DNA synthesis can be determined from the amount of bromodeoxy-uridine (BrdUrd) incorporated into cells after a short exposure to BrdUrd. We developed a computer program to quantify the inhibition of the rate of DNA synthesis by analysis of the distribution of BrdUrd/DNA. Inhibition was evaluated in ara-C-sensitive and resistant cells after incubation with different doses of ara-C. An index of resistance to ara-C (RI) was expressed as the ratio of the amount of BrdUrd incorporated into S phase cells incubated with ara-C to that incorporated in the absence of ara-C. In the ara-C-sensitive and resistant HL60 cells, a linear relationship between RI and log ara-C concentration was observed. Small numbers of slightly resistant cells in mixtures of ara-C-sensitive and resistant cells could be determined using this method, making it suitable for clinical use to test the resistance of leukemic cells to ara-C.
