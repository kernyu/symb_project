The present study was carried out to ascertain whether the active component of Corynebacterium kutscheri (CK-M) could stimulate host cells of mice to produce several cytokines. CK-M stimulated thioglycollate-induced peritoneal macrophages to produce interleukin 1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) at concentrations of 1-100 ng/ml, and it also induced IL-2 and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) as well as IL-6 production by splenocytes. Maximum production of each cytokine induced by CK-M was obtained at the following doses: IL-1 at 5 ng/ml, TNF-alpha at 50 ng/ml, IL-2 at 1 microgram/ml, IL-6 at 500 ng/ml and IFN-gamma at 750 ng/ml. In contrast, IL-4 was not produced to a significant extent by CK-M-stimulated splenocytes. Furthermore, when mice were intravenously injected with 20 micrograms of CK-M, IL-2 and IFN-gamma production by splenocytes, upon stimulation with either formalin-killed C. kutscheri or mitogens, was significantly higher on day 10 of treatment than on day 2. Additionally, the cytotoxicity to L929 cells of this serum from CK-M-treated mice increased with time, and the activity in the serum of day 10 was not abrogated by the antibody to TNF-alpha. Data obtained here indicate that CK-M may preferentially stimulate type-1 helper T cells to produce IL-2 and IFN-gamma, and that the enhanced cytokine production could contribute to the nonspecific resistance induced by C. kutscheri.
