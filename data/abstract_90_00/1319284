The pAN7.1 plasmid containing the E. coli hygromycin B phosphotransferase gene was used to transform protoplasts of the ectomycorrhizal fungus Hebeloma cylindrosporum. Hygromycin-resistant transformants were selected at a frequency of one to five per micrograms of transforming DNA. Southern blot analyses revealed multiple copy integration of the transforming plasmid into the genome. The selection system was used to introduce other genes of interest by co-transformation. Two plasmids, one containing tryptophan biosynthesis genes and the other the NADP-glutamate dehydrogenase gene from the saprophytic basidiomycete Coprinus cinereus, were successfully introduced into the H. cylindrosporum genome with up to 70% efficiency of co-transformation. The hygromycin resistance phenotype was stably maintained during growth of transformants on hygromycin-free medium. All transformants retained their ability to form mycorrhizae with the habitual host plant Pinus pinaster, making them suitable for future physiological studies.
