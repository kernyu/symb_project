Tuberculosis caused by the intracellular bacterial pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis still represents a major health problem, and its effective control would best be accomplished by active vaccination. Although vaccination with M. bovis BCG has proven highly effective in certain parts of the world, in several developing countries it has been found to confer only marginal protection. Hence, novel vaccination strategies are warranted. Mycobacterium w is a saprophytic cultivable mycobacterium which shares several antigens with M. tuberculosis. In the murine system, vaccination with killed M. w was found to protect against subsequent tuberculosis. In order to characterize the responsible immune mechanisms more precisely, mice were vaccinated with killed M. w and T cells restimulated in vitro with mycobacterial antigens. These T cells produced interleukin 2 and gamma interferon but no detectable interleukin 4 and interleukin 5. Killed M. w induced significantly stronger T-cell responses than killed M. tuberculosis, and both vaccination regimes were markedly improved by administration in a mild adjuvant, i.e., the Ribi adjuvant containing trehalose dimycolate, monophosphoryl lipid A, and mycobacterial cell wall skeleton. Our data suggest that M. w-induced immunity against M. tuberculosis rests primarily on TH1 cells, which are thought to be of major relevance for acquired antituberculosis resistance. Our study therefore provides a further step toward the identification of a novel tuberculosis vaccine.
