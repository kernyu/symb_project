The importance of microbial surveillance is illustrated in 3 clinical cases. Each case demonstrated a continued lack of response to conventional periodontal treatment. Repeated bouts of periodontal abscess formation and bone loss occurred over a 3- to 4-year period, despite numerous surgeries supplemented with antibiotics. As a result, patients were termed refractory to treatment and extensive microbiological analysis and sensitivity testing was performed. Following institution of the appropriate antibiotic and conservative therapy consisting of several sessions of scaling and root planning, each of these cases demonstrated a dramatic remission of disease progression. No further breakdown has been seen for a minimum of 2 1/2 years. While anecdotal in nature, these cases support the usefulness of microbial identification coupled with antibiotic sensitivity as an adjunct to conventional conservative periodontal therapy.
