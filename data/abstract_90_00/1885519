The buoyant density of wild-type Escherichia coli cells has previously been reported not to vary with growth rate and cell size or age. In the present report we confirm these findings, using Percoll gradients, and analyze the recently described lov mutant, which was selected for its resistance to mecillinam and has been suggested to be affected in the coordination between mass growth and envelope synthesis. The average buoyant density of lov mutant cells was significantly lower than that of wild-type cells. Similarly, the buoyant density of wild-type cells decreased in the presence of mecillinam. The density of the lov mutant, like that of the wild type, was invariant over a 2.8-fold range in growth rate. In this range, however, the average cell volume was also constant. Analysis of buoyant density as a function of cell volume in individual cultures revealed that smaller (newborn) lov mutant cells had higher density than larger (old) cells; however, the density of the small cells never approached that of the wild-type cells, whose density was independent of cell size (age). A pattern similar to that of lov mutant cells was observed in cells carrying the mecillinam-resistant mutations pbpA(Ts) and rodA(Ts) and the division mutation ftsI(Ts) at nonpermissive temperatures as well as in wild-type cells treated with mecillinam, but not in mecillinam-resistant crp or cya mutants.
