After nearly 10 years of fluoroquinolone usage for a wide range of bacterial infections, a striking difference has been observed in the incidence of bacterial resistance to fluoroquinolones between bacteria responsible for community- and hospital-acquired infections, respectively. Resistance is only rarely encountered among common pathogens. In most studies, 97 to 100% of all pathogens are fully susceptible to fluoroquinolones. In contrast, resistance to fluoroquinolones has emerged and increased among bacteria responsible for nosocomial infections. The incidence of resistance to fluoroquinolones varies between bacterial species, clinical settings and countries, and is related to local epidemic spread of a few clones. The highest incidence of resistance is observed in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter spp., Serratia marcescens and, particularly, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA): some investigators have reported 95 to 100% fluoroquinolone resistance among MRSA. Follow-up of trends in the resistance to fluoroquinolones based upon surveillance programmes are needed.
