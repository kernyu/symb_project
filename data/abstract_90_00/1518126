Panipenem/betamipron (PAPM/BP) was given by 30 minutes drip infusion to 15 children with acute bacterial infections including 11 with acute pneumonia, 2 each with staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome and urinary tract infections. Good to excellent clinical responses were obtained in all of the 15 patients and bacterial eradications were obtained for all 12 strains identified in these cases. Urticaria considered to be drug related was observed in 1 patient. Slight elevations of GOT and GPT and eosinophilia were observed in 1 case each. From the above clinical results, it appears that PAPM/BP is a useful antibiotic for treatment of pediatric patients with various bacterial infections.
