A clinical isolate of Klebsiella pneumoniae sensu lato isolated from throat and a blood culture taken from a neutropenic patient treated for 2 weeks with ceftazidime and vancomycin was resistant to ceftazidime (MIC: 32 micrograms/ml) and moderately susceptible to aztreonam (MIC: 4 micrograms/ml). The isolate contained a plasmid of 180 kb which, when transferred to Escherichia coli by conjugation, conferred resistance to ceftazidime and tetracycline. The transconjugant had decreased susceptibility to ceftazidime (128-fold) and aztreonam (8-fold). Clavulanic acid and sulbactam each inhibited the resistance and clavulanic acid showed a synergistic effect when associated with ceftazidime and aztreonam. An extended-spectrum beta-lactamase with an isoelectric point of 7.6 was detected in the clinical isolates from blood and its transconjugant. This beta-lactamase showed similar substrate and inhibition profiles to SHV-1. In particular it did not hydrolyse ceftazidime. Hybridization with an intragenic probe for SHV-3 indicates that this beta-lactamase is an SHV-type enzyme. We propose that this novel CAZ-type extended-spectrum beta-lactamase be named SHV-6.
