The sensitivity of 235 N. meningitidis strains to 5 antibiotics was estimated by the diameter of growth inhibition zones according to the criteria recommended by a Laboratory (Marseilles, France) collaborating with the WHO. All the strains proved to be sensitive to benzylpenicillin when disks containing 10 and 2 IU of the antibiotic were used. The strains were also shown to be sensitive to chloramphenicol and tetracycline. 95.7 and 7.7 per cent of the strains were sensitive to rifampicin and oleandomycin, respectively. When the strain sensitivity was assayed with the disks containing 10 and 2 IU of benzylpenicillin by the more severe criteria recommended by J. Saez-Nieto et al., significant changes were detected: meningococci with relative resistance to benzylpenicillin were detected in various regions of this country and the number of such strains was found to have a tendency to slightly increase.
