Cyclosporin A has heterogeneous effects on anthracycline-related cardiotoxicity and can prevent multidrug-resistance (MDR). The aim of this study was to explore whether the coadministration of cyclosporin A is accompanied by an increase in cardiotoxicity. Forty-three patients (27 male, 16 female, age: 18-67 yrs [mean: 47.5 yrs, SD: 11.6 yrs]) received 177 radionuclide ventriculography examinations (RNV 177 at rest, 133 at stress) before and during chemotherapy with either doxorubicin (n = 23) or epirubicin (n = 20). RNV studies were applied up to 11 times in the follow-up of the patients. A maximum of 10 courses of chemotherapy was performed. In the doxorubicin group only, the age of the patients and the cumulative dose of the chemotherapeutic agent had a significant negative impact on left ventricular ejection fractions, whereas cyclosporin A had a significant positive influence (multiple analysis of regression, p < 0.05). Cyclosporin A did not cause any significant increase in cardiotoxicity in our patients.
