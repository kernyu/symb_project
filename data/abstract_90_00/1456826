Rats with altered microbial ecology and decreased colonization resistance due to neutropenia induced by cyclophosphamide were used as a model for estimating the effect of bacterial polysaccharides (lactulose and exopolysaccharide from Bacillus polymyxa) and fluoroquinolones (pefloxacin). Monotherapy with pefloxacin had a favourable effect both on normalization on the intestinal microflora in the rats and their hemopoiesis (decreased neutropenia). The highest correcting effect with respect to the lowered colonization resistance was observed when pefloxacin was used in combination with exopolysaccharide.
