Cefepime is a potent, broad-spectrum, fourth-generation cephalosporin with enhanced activity against most gram-positive aerobic bacterial pathogens and many gram-negative aerobic bacteria that are resistant to other cephalosporins. The drug's zwitterionic structure contributes to more rapid penetration of gram-negative bacterial cell membranes, and its low affinity for most type I beta-lactamases leads to significantly reduced enzymatic degradation compared with other cephalosporins. Cefepime has a good toxicity profile, with minor gastrointestinal and central nervous system symptoms being most prevalent. At dosages ranging from 1-2 g every 8-12 hours, it is an alternative option for infections of the lower respiratory tract, urinary tract, and skin and skin structures, as well as febrile episodes in neutropenic patients with cancer, and bacteremia or septicemia in critically ill patients.
