The human endometrial adenocarcinoma cells IK were found to be highly susceptible for TNF but rapidly developed a resistance to this cytokine. Inhibitors of RNA transcription or protein biosynthesis could not overcome this resistance. Moreover TNF resistance was not associated with increased resistance to hydrogen peroxide. The resistant phenotype remained stable and was not communicated to neighbouring cells in a paracrine manner. The TNF treatment did not induce a multidrug resistance on IK cells. Nude mice bearing xenotransplanted endometrial carcinoma cells did not benefit from TNF treatment.
