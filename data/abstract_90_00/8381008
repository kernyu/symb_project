In a search for new antiretroviral agents acting at the nucleic acid level, two hybrid molecules composed of a bispyrrolecarboxamide chain related to netropsin, linked to the intercalating chromophore oxazolopyridocarbazole, were tested on the cycle of a defective Moloney murine leukemia virus (M.MuLV) derived from the SVX shuttle and expressing resistance to the G418 antibiotic. The drug netropsin-oxazolopyridocarbazole (Net-OPC), which displays a binding preference to duplex DNA containing A + T bases, inhibits the retroviral replicative cycle (IC50 = 4.8 microM). In contrast, the related molecule (bis)pyrollecarboxamide-oxazolopyridocarbazole (Bpc-OPC) devoid of sequence preference as well as the elemental components of Net-OPC, namely OPC, pentyl-OPC and netropsin, displays no significant action on the viral cycle. The estimation of cytosolic viral DNA in infected cells using quantitative polymerase chain reaction suggests that Net-OPC impairs a post retrotranscriptional step of the viral cycle.
