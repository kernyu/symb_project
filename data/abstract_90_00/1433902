Combined antibacterial effects of imipenem (IPM)+arbekacin (ABK) and cefminox (CMNX)+ABK against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) were examined and the obtained results are summarized below. 1. Either combination, IPM+ABK or CMNX+ABK, showed a strong antibacterial effect against MRSA when blood concentration of ABK were sustained at MIC as could be expected in clinical situations. While at sub MICs of ABK the antibacterial effect of these combination was slightly less than those of the previously reported combinations of ABK and other antibiotics. 2. Antibacterial effects of the combinations against MRSA were strongly dependent on the concentration of ABK and less dependent on the concentration of IPM or CMNX. As were observed in the previously tested combinations of ABK with other antibiotics, the antibacterial effect of the combination appeared to be highly dependent on the antibacterial activity and the concentration of ABK. 3. As IPM has potent antibacterial activities against Gram-negative bacteria (GNB) including Pseudomonas aeruginosa while CMNX has potent antibacterial activities against GNB except P. aeruginosa, it is likely that the combinations of IPM+ABK or CMNX+ABK are useful for treatment of infections with MRSA together with GNB.
