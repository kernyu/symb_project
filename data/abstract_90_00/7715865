Urinary discomfort is the second most common physical complaint affecting women. Although urinary discomfort is commonly a result of inflammation due to bacterial invasion, there are also nonbacterial causes. The development of antimicrobial resistance to bacteria is frequent and costs the patient and the medical community unnecessary time and money. Antimicrobial intervention should be instituted only after the uropathogen is identified through a urine culture. While awaiting the results of the urine culture or other laboratory or radiological tests, the patient's symptoms can be relieved with the use of urinary analgesics or antispasmodics. This conservative approach meets the immediate concern of the patient and better ensures a proper diagnostic workup and successful cure. Along with a conservative diagnostic approach, the patient should be included in all aspects of health care management.
