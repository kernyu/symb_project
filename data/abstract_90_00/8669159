Out of 11 patients suffering from Mycobacterium xenopi lung disease, 9 were treated with an empiric antituberculous triple chemotherapy until specific identification and antibiogram were available. Despite the important "in vitro" resistance to drugs, most of the patients improved; in the other patients, the impairment was always due to the underlying pathology. We conclude that the "in vivo" response of M. xenopi infections to antituberculous drugs is little influenced by the "in vitro" sensitivity.
