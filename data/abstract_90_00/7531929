The presence of persistence markers of some staphylococcal species isolated from the air at an obstetric hospital was established. The presence of such markers was most pronounced in S. aureus, which was indicative of its absolute value for characterizing the sanitary state of the environment. Staphylococci of coagulase-negative species were characterized by the presence of antilysozyme activity, as well as by their ability to inactivate the antibacterial component of the preparation of interferon, most pronounced in microorganisms of the species S. epidermidis and S. haemolyticus. Disinfecting measures, carried out with the use of ozone, made it possible to normalize the quantitative and qualitative characteristics of bacterial aerosol, which was mainly manifested by the air elimination of staphylococci having a set of persistence markers, as well as the capacity for producing hemolysin.
