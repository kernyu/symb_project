We have previously shown that resistance to Leishmania infantum in dogs is associated with a Th1 type of immune response. In this study, we use a canine macrophage cell line (030-D) that can readily be infected with this protozoan parasite. Our aim is to further characterize the effector mechanisms involved in killing of Leishmania parasite in dogs. We observed that activation of 030-D cells by incubation with a supernatant derived from a Leishmania-specific T cell line containing IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha and interleukin-2 (IL-2) resulted in enhanced nitric oxide (NO) production by these cells. In addition, we observed enhanced anti-leishmanial activity of infected 030-cells after activation. Both, NO production and anti-leishmanial activity were abrogated by addition of L-N(G)-nitroargininemethyl ester (L-NAME), an analogue of L-arginine. Thus, NO play an important role in the anti-leishmanial activity of these canine macrophages. We propose the infection of the 030-D cell line as a good in vitro model to further investigate parasite-host cell interactions in dogs, a natural host of Leishmania parasites.
