The synergistic effect of MRK-16, a monoclonal antibody against P-glycoprotein, and cyclosporin A (CsA) on the modulation of vincristine resistance was studied by isobologram analysis in three different, highly multidrug-resistant tumor cells. In all cell lines, the synergistic effect was demonstrated at various concentrations of MRK-16 and CsA. While MRK-16 alone did not enhance the sensitivity of the moderately resistant KB-8-5 cells to vincristine, it increased two-fold the reversing effect of cyclosporin A at 1 microM, an achievable blood concentration. Since MRK-16 alone showed therapeutic effects against multidrug-resistant tumors, the combined use of MRK-16, CsA and antitumor agents should provide therapeutic benefits for the treatment of resistant tumors.
