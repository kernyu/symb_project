The sensitivity of 310 Gram-positive strains, isolated from milking cows udders, to 4 antiseptics (cetrimide, chlorhexidine, hexachlorophene and mercury) and 9 antibiotics (ampicillin, streptomycin, erythromycin, chloramphenicol, kanamycin, tetracycline, gentamycin, novobiocin and oxacillin) was determined. The statistical analysis of correlation was carried out for the bacterial species studied (Staphylococcus, Streptococcus and Bacillus), the scattering of the minimum inhibitory concentrations of which has proved to be statistically heterogeneous towards antiseptics and antibiotics. This analysis revealed positive links between chlorhexidine and 5 antibiotics for Streptococcus and between hexachlorophene and oxacillin for Bacillus. The analysis of results at the level of bacterial species, taking into account a loss of sensitivity of 4 times the modal minimum inhibitory concentration of the species reveals the importance of the strains which are resistant to many antibiotics and especially the Enterococcus and the species Staphylococcus epidermidis. Indeed, these strains are possible reservoirs of plasmids of resistance to antibiotics and antiseptics.
