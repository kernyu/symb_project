It is important to test the antimicrobial sensitivity of the aetiological agents of otitis externa before starting treatment in order to prevent the development of antibiotic resistance in the microorganisms. In this study the sensitivity patterns in bacteria and yeasts isolated as aetiological agents from otitis externa were analysed. Antifungal and antibacterial activity tests were done using the automated system ATB Fungus and the classic diffusion test respectively. The azole compounds had the greatest antifungal properties, while beta-lactams had the strongest antibiotic activity. This study reflects the increasing importance of sensitivity tests in chronic otitis externa due to the increasing antimicrobial resistances in bacteria and yeasts. If it is necessary to initiate an empiric treatment before the results of the antimicrobial test, the application of miconazole or econazole for yeasts and oxacillin or amoxicillin-clavulanic acid against bacteria is recommended.
