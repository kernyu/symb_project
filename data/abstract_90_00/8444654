The killing kinetics of cefotaxime and fosfomycin, alone and in combination, against seven clinical isolates of penicillin-resistant pneumococci were studied. The antibiotics were tested at 1 x, 2 x and 4 x the MIC for each individual isolate. The results showed a synergic interaction of the two antibiotics for three of the seven strains. This strategy may be useful clinically.
