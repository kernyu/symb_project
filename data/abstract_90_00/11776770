OBJECTIVE: To study the risk factors and treatment of lower respiratory tract infections due to E. ictaluri, and the cause of its improved detection by sputum culture in recent years. METHODS: To sum up the number of positive cultures and analyze the clinical features of the cases with positive sputum culture tested from 1959 to 1998. RESULTS: Before 1996, there were no positive cultures (0%) in 17,500 sputum samples using manual techniques, in 1997 and 1998 the aggregate positive rate was 2.3% (47/1,962), using SCEPTOR detecting instrument. On chi square testing of the two results derived from the two methods, P < 0.001. On drug sensitivity testing, E. ictaluri was sensitive to imipenem, cefotaxime and tobramycin. CONCLUSIONS: E. ictaluri is an uncommon opportunistic pathogen of lower respiratory tract infections. Lowered body resistance is a risk factor, and improved technology is the principal cause for detection of E. ictaluri infections.
