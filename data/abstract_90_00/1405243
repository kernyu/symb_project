To study the relative roles of creatine kinase (CK) and adenylate systems in cardiac energy turnover, the effect of CK inhibitor, iodoacetamide- (IAA, 0.5 mM), and 2-deoxyglucose-(DOG, 2 mM) induced) 65% depletion of adenine nucleotides at slightly decreased CK flux was determined in isolated rat heart. Both substances did not substantially affect contractile parameters of the isovolumic heart. However, an augmentation of cardiac work induced by isoproterenol addition was feeble and transient in IAA-treated hearts while the response of DOG-treated hearts was well preserved. The cardiac failure after IAA treatment was associated with irreversible fall in myocardial ATP content as evidenced by 31P-NMR technique. Furthermore, these hearts were unable to perform cardiac pump function due to insufficient cardiac filling and distensibility. The DOG-treated hearts exhibited 50% reduction in the pump function and were able to increase their work in elevated resistance. The results suggest that CK pathway is extremely important for both full cardiac relaxation and maximal contractile function.
