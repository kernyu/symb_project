Resistant variants were selected in vitro against two novel nucleoside analogues, (+) dOTC and (-) dOTFC using the HIV-1 molecular clone HXB2D. The variants obtained displayed 6.5-fold and 10-fold resistance to these compounds, respectively. Cloning and sequencing of the RT genes of the selected viruses identified two mutations, M184I for (+) dOTC and M184V for (-) dOTFC. Results with mutated recombinant clones of HXB2D confirmed the importance of these mutations in MT-4 cells. The resistance profiles of clinical samples with wild-type or 3TC-resistant phenotypes were also studied; low to moderate levels of cross-resistance were observed against the novel compounds.
