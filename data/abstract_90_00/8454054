The influence of the overproduced elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu) from Thermus thermophilus on the protein biosynthesis in Escherichia coli was investigated both in vivo and in vitro. A kirromycin-resistant E. coli strain became sensitive to this antibiotic upon the expression of the tuf A-gene of T. thermophilus present on a plasmid. In in vitro translation with components of the kirromycin-resistant E. coli strain the poly(Phe) synthesis stopped when minute amounts of the EF-Tu from T. thermophilus were added. Both results indicate the sensitivity of the T. thermophilus EF-Tu to kirromycin and its participation in the polypeptide synthesis of E. coli.
