A cyclophosphamide-induced leucopenic mouse model was used to compare the therapeutic efficacy of clinafloxacin, a fluoroquinolone in clinical trials, with that of ciprofloxacin and imipenem/cilastatin, two clinically relevant standard drugs. Acute systemic infections induced by Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a penicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and a methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) were used to evaluate drug efficacy. Median protective values (PD50) with 95% confidence limits were determined in both leucopenic and normal mice. Results show that clinafloxacin is potentially a useful agent in the treatment of neutropenic patients.
