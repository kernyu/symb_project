OBJECTIVE: To study the synergistic action of a combination of guanghuoxiang volatile oil (B) and sodium artesunate (SA) against Plasmodium berghei (P. b) and the resistance-reversal activity against SA-resistant P. b (P. b SA-R). METHODS: Mice infected with P. b N or P. b R were treated with a combination of B and SA respectively by 4-day suppressive test method and linear regression to calculate the SD50 of B and SA for each drug alone and in combination (equally effective dose compatibility). RESULTS: B alone, N:SD50 = 87.64 +/- 19.58(GKD), R:SD50 = 43.24 +/- 7.71(GKD); SA alone, N:SD50 = 0.88 +/- 0.01(MGKD), R:SD50 = 27.69 +/- 0.93(MGKD). B and SA combination, N:B SD50 = 36.89 +/- 4.57(GKD), SA SD50 = 0.39 +/- 0.05 (MGKD); R:B SD50 = 7.40 +/- 1.30(GKD), SA SD50 = 4.21 +/- 0.74(MGKD). The synergistic indexes of B and SA in combination were 2.2 for N and 6.6 for R, respectivly. The multiple of resistance reversal of B vs SA was 6.6. The relative reversal rate was 87.6%. CONCLUSION: A combination of B and SA may enhance the antimalarial effect against P. b and reverse the SA-resistance of P. b and delay the occurrence of resistance to SA in N.
