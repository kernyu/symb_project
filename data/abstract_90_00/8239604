Enterococci have emerged as significant nosocomial pathogens. Enterococci with resistance to commonly used antibiotics are appearing more frequently. We encountered at our institution several infections caused by Enterococcus faecium with high-level resistance to ampicillin, vancomycin, and gentamicin. The optimal antibiotic therapy for serious infections with unusually resistant enterococci has not been established. Using time-kill studies, we tested the effectiveness of various antibiotic combinations against 15 isolates of multidrug-resistant enterococci. No antibiotic was consistently effective when used alone. The combination of ampicillin plus ciprofloxacin was bactericidal for the 12 isolates for which the ciprofloxacin MIC was < or = 8 micrograms/ml. The combination of ciprofloxacin plus novobiocin also demonstrated activity against these isolates. No combination was found to be bactericidal for the remaining three isolates, which were highly ciprofloxacin resistant. These antibiotic combinations may be important for the future treatment of serious infections caused by these resistant pathogens.
