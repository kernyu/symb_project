One hundred and four effusions from 66 children with CSOM were cultured for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Fifty percent of all effusions yielded bacterial growth and Gram negative organisms constituted 69.2% of those isolates. H. influenza was the most commonly isolated organism (36.5%) followed by B. catarrhalis and Str. pneumoniae. All B. catarrhalis, Staph. aureus and pseudomonas isolates were resistant to ampicillin while cefotaxime was active against all the isolated Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria. Considering B-lactamase production, all the isolated Staph. aureus were BLPs while in case of Gram negative bacteria, not all the ampicillin resistant strains were BLPs.
