Endotoxin results in a granulocyte mediated loss of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV). Dapsone blocks the granulocyte respiratory burst and might, therefore, preserve HPV following endotoxin. Isolated-perfused canine lobes (n = 6) were pretreated with 18 mg/kg dapsone (dapsone group), and compared to six lobes which did not receive dapsone (control group). Total pulmonary vascular resistance (Rtot) and arterial, middle (Rm), and venous segmental resistances were calculated by a vascular occlusion technique. We then administered endotoxin (2 mg/kg) and repeated measurements at 5, 30, and 90 min. The increase in Rm during 3% O2 compared to 35% O2 ventilation was used to define the presence of HPV. In the control group, following endotoxin, values of Rm did not change (P > 0.05) during 3% O2 ventilation (0.011 +/- 0.006 cm H2O/ml/min) compared with 35% O2 ventilation (0.014 +/- 0.005 cm H2O/ml/min). In the dapsone group, following endotoxin, values of Rm increased (P < 0.05) during 3% O2 ventilation (0.06 +/- 0.026 cm H2O/ml/min) compared with 35% O2 ventilation (0.03 +/- 0.015 cm H2O/ml/min). Changes in 6-keto PGF1 alpha or thromboxane B2 do not explain these observations. We conclude that in this experimental preparation, pretreatment with dapsone prevents the loss of HPV associated with endotoxin.
