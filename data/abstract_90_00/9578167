The activity of trovafloxacin and five other oral agents against 250 aerobic and 137 anaerobic strains isolated from human and animal bite wounds was determined by an agar dilution method. Trovafloxacin was active against all aerobic and fastidious facultative isolates at < or = 0.5 mg/L and all anaerobes at < or = 2 mg/L (Bacteroides tectum, Porphyromonas salivosa and Prevotella heparinolytica, < or = 0.25 mg/L; Porphyromonas spp., < or = 0.5 mg/L; Prevotella spp. and peptostreptococci, < or = 2.0 mg/L), except Fusobacterium nucleatum and other fusobacteria (MIC90 < or = 4 mg/L). Levofloxacin was generally one to two dilutions more active than ofloxacin, while ciprofloxacin was active against aerobes (MIC < or = 1 mg/L) but less active against anaerobic strains (MIC90 < or = 16 mg/L).
