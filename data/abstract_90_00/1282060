Based upon our previous report indicating the presence of retrovirus-like particles in human gastric cancer cells, we analyzed the putative endogenous reverse transcriptase activity these particles should have. To evaluate the specificity of reverse transcription over that displayed by normal cellular DNA polymerases, the following discriminatory criteria were used: 1) resistance to high concentrations of Actinomycin D; 2) sensitivity to preincubation with ribonuclease A; 3) behavior in cesium sulfate isopycnic gradients and 4) size-shifting of putative template-product complexes after RNase exposure in agarose gel electrophoresis. We report a significant endogenous reverse transcriptase activity associated with membrane-encapsidated particles from terminally-illed patients but not in normal counterparts. Although these structures closely resemble retro viruses, a new model is proposed to explain our findings.
