We generated transgenic sugarcane plants that express an albicidin detoxifying gene (albD), which was cloned from a bacterium that provides biocontrol against leaf scald disease. Plants with albicidin detoxification capacity equivalent to 1-10 ng of AlbD enzyme per mg of leaf protein did not develop chlorotic disease symptoms in inoculated leaves, whereas all untransformed control plants developed severe symptoms. Transgenic lines with high AlbD activity in young stems were also protected against systemic multiplication of the pathogen, which is the precursor to economic disease. We have shown that genetic modification to express a toxin-resistance gene can confer resistance to both disease symptoms and multiplication of a toxigenic pathogen in its host.
