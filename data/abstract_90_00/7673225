Verapamil increases the net uptake and cytotoxicity of structurally diverse hydrophobic molecules in many multidrug-resistant mammalian cell lines. This compound has also been reported to reverse chloroquine resistance in the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum (Martin, S.K., Oduola, A.M.J., and Milhous, W.K. (1987) Science 235, 899-901). Although the mechanism of this reversal is unknown, it apparently involves an increase in the amount of chloroquine present in erythrocytes infected with the resistant parasites. Chloroquine is a diprotic weak base that accumulates in acidic organelles as a function of the pH gradient present between the organelle and the external medium. By changing the external medium pH, this property of chloroquine was used to alter the cytotoxicity phenotype of genetically chloroquine-sensitive and -resistant trophozoites. Verapamil was also found to be toxic for malaria trophozoites, although this toxicity was independent of external pH and consistently about 3-4-fold higher against resistant strains. When verapamil was tested for its effects on chloroquine cytotoxicity under conditions of phenotypic reversal, it was still found to exert only a measurable effect on the genetically resistant trophozoites. In short time incubations, verapamil was found to increase net chloroquine accumulation in erythrocytes infected with both chloroquine-sensitive and -resistant organisms, but only to affect the chloroquine susceptibility of the latter. Analysis of our data demonstrates that verapamil works independently of the overall pH gradient concentrating chloroquine into a trophozoite's lysosome. Instead, we propose that it inhibits the activity of a membrane ion channel indirectly responsible for determining chloroquine transit within the parasite's cytoplasm.
