Antiseptics that are locally applicable gain in significance due to their reliable microbicidal effectiveness and especially due to the rising incidence of highly resistant bacteria. This is because systemically applied antibiotics are not sufficient in eradicating superficial mucodermal bacteria and locally applied antibiotics can cause new resistance rapidly. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the microbicidal effectiveness of Poly(1-vinyl-2-pyrrodlidon)-iodine (PVP-iodine) against ten genotypical different methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus-(MRSA-) and five Enterococcus faecium-strains in a quantitative suspension test. The effectiveness of PVP-iodine with protein load (0.2% and 2% albumin) was tested against three MRSA strains. Without any protein load best microbicidial activity (KRt-value > 5) was obtained with concentrations in the range between 1-10% of the original Betaisodona solution after 30s exposure time. With protein load (0.2% albumin) the optimum in microbicidal effectiveness shifts to concentrations > or = 10% Betaisodona solution referring to an exposure time of 30s. With a protein load up to 2% albumin and an exposure time of 30s the bactericidal activity of the undiluted Betaisodona solution is already satisfying, while the 10% solution is not active till an exposure time of 5 min. Summing up PVP-iodine is recommended as a local mucodermal antiseptic against highly resistant gram positives.
