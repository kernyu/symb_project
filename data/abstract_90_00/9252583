A plasmid is described for Bacillus subtilis that facilitates replacement of the widely used neomycin resistance gene (neo) with a spectinomycin resistance (spcE) gene. A second plasmid is described that facilitates replacement of spcS, associated with mini-Tn10 mutagenesis in B. subtilis, with neo. These plasmids can also function as integrative vectors for B. subtilis. They expand the scope of strain construction and gene analysis in B. subtilis.
