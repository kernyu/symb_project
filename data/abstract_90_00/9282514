Orissa is known for its contribution of 15-20% of malaria cases to the national total. Deaths due to malaria in the state are also not uncommon. Proportion of P. falciparum cases have reached to 85%. In the recent years over 0.3 million confirmed malaria cases have been reported each year. Annual consumption of chloroquine in the state is over 170 lakh tablets. A 17 year study on monitoring of choloroquine resistance in P. falciparum in Orissa revealed that out of a total of 1165 tests conducted in vivo, in 12% of the cases RI level of resistance was detected. And 4.4% cases were of RII and 1.9% RIII level. 51% of the sample tested in vitro showed P. falciparum resistance to chloroquine. P. falciparum resistance to chloroquine appears to have been developed by the parasite over the length and breadth of the state. Strengthening of the monitoring of drug resistance in P. falciparum in the state is indicated.
