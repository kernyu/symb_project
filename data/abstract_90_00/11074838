BACKGROUND: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a potentially lethal organism in pediatric patients. MRSA is an uncommon otologic pathogen that requires special diagnostic and therapeutic intervention. METHODS: Three pediatric patients with community-acquired MRSA otologic infections were identified during 1999. SETTING: Tertiary care ear institution. RESULTS: All patients required intravenous antibiotic therapy to achieve resolution of the infections. CONCLUSIONS: MRSA in children can be community acquired and can cause otitis externa, otitis media with otorrhea, or acute mastoiditis; intravenous therapy that includes vancomycin is necessary for resolution.
