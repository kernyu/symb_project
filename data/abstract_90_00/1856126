MICs of penicillin, methicillin, clindamycin, erythromycin, sodium fusidate and gentamicin were determined by an agar dilution method for 300 current isolates of Staphylococcus aureus and 100 of S. epidermidis, collected from four centres, and 38 stock strains of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). All but one of the 300 current isolates of S. aureus were sensitive to clindamycin (MIC less than 0.5 mg/l), with an MIC90 of 0.12 mg/l. Of a total of 39 MRSA strains, 11 (28.2%) were resistant to clindamycin (MIC greater than 32 mg/l); all of these strains were also resistant to erythromycin. Ten of the 100 strains of S. epidermidis were resistant to clindamycin; they came from a reasonably equal geographical distribution and were also resistant to erythromycin. The results suggest that clindamycin might still be useful as a second-line agent for infections caused by S. aureus and S. epidermidis, although its activity against MRSA was limited to approximately two-thirds of the MRSA strains tested in this study.
