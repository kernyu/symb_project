Pharmacokinetic and clinical evaluation was conducted on the combination drug, tazobactam/piperacillin (TAZ/PIPC, YP-14), of newly developed beta-lactamase inhibitor, tazobactam (TAZ), and antibiotic agent of penicillin group for injections, piperacillin (PIPC), and the following results were obtained. 1. Absorption and excretion Both serum levels of TAZ and PIPC after the intravenous drip infusion for 30 minutes at the dose of 25 mg/kg or 50 mg/kg of TAZ/PIPC showed peaks at the end of the intravenous drip infusion (in 30 minutes after the commencement of the administration) with the levels of 11.93 or 26.05 micrograms/ml for TAZ and 49.80 or 107.50 micrograms/ml for PIPC. The halflife times were 0.51 or 0.67 hours for TAZ and 0.51 or 0.54 hours for PIPC. The serum level of desethyl-piperacillin (DEt-PIPC), an active metabolite of PIPC, showed a peak one hour after the end of the intravenous drip infusion (in 90 minutes after the commencement of the administration) with the level of 0.79 or 1.47 micrograms/ml. On the other hand, cumulative recovery ratios into urine were 41.3% or 40.4% for TAZ and 38.7% or 37.8% for PIPC. The recovery ratio for DEt-PIPC, an active metabolite of PIPC, was 1.9% or 0.3%. 2. Clinical evaluation TAZ/PIPC was administered to 47 cases (pneumonia: 25 cases, bronchitis: 16 cases, cutaneous soft tissue infection: 3 cases, urinary tract infection: 2 cases and lymphadenitis: 1 case). Clinical efficacy evaluation was conducted in 45 cases, excluding one case with bronchitis complicated by measles and other one case with left cervical cellulitis complicated by mumps. Good or more efficacy was observed in the all cases (excellent efficacy: 28 cases and good efficacy: 17 cases). The eradication rate in 31 cases where the pathogenic bacteria were identified and bacteriological efficacy was revealed was 93.5% (29/31 cases). Out of them, bacterial replacement was observed in 5 cases. Decrease in bacteria (including partial eradication) was observed in the remaining 2 cases. Adverse reactions were not reported in any cases. Abnormal values of clinical laboratory examination were reported in 5 cases (increase in platelet count: 2 cases, decrease in leukocyte count: 2 cases and increase in eosinophil count: 1 case). However, there was no case requiring any treatment.
