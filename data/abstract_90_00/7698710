A 17 year old Asian patient with autoimmune chronic active hepatitis resistant to treatment with high dose corticosteroids and azathioprine was given cyclosporin at a dose of 5 mg/kg/day. Within two weeks of starting the cyclosporin treatment a favourable clinical and biochemical response was obtained and by one month serum aminotransferase activities were within normal limits. An attempted reduction in the daily dose of cyclosporin resulted in a relapse of the patient's disease. Remission was again attained by returning the dose of cyclosporin to 5 mg/kg/day. No significant side effects of the treatment have been shown. Cyclosporin seems to have a role in the treatment of corticosteroid resistant autoimmune chronic active hepatitis and its further evaluation is warranted.
