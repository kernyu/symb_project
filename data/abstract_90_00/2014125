Distribution according to species and genus and resistance to antibacterial agents was studied with 420 bacterial isolates cultured from the wound excretion of 282 burned-infected patients. Of the isolates 68.2% was Gram-positive and 31.8% Gram-negative. This latter high rate may be due to fecal infection as 21% of the burned patients was between the age of 0-4 years. Of the total isolates 38.3% was Staphylococcus aureus, 16.7% coagulase-negative staphylococcus, 10.7% Pseudomonas strain, 6.9% Escherichia coli and 4.8% Klebsiella. Vancomycin resistant Staphylococcus strain was not found. On the other hand 30-35% of the strains was cross-resistant to methicillin- oxacillin-cefuroxim-clindamycin though these agents are the most potent following the vancomycine. Ceftazidime is the most effective agent for Pseudomonas strains being followed by amikacin, carbenicillin, tobramycin and ceftriaxon. Other Gram-negative bacteria showed strongest sensitivity to ceftazidime and ceftriaxone and these are followed by amikacin.
