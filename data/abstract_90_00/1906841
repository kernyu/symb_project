Unlike Mycobacterium leprae, Mycobacterium tuberculosis is not found inside cells other than macrophages and polymorphonuclear cells in vivo, yet previous work has revealed that in vitro it readily enters all cell lines tested. Moreover, these cells are not killed by the intracellular mycobacteria. We report here that when fibroblasts take up live (but not killed) M. tuberculosis H37Rv, they develop greatly increased sensitivity to the toxic effects of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) whether the cell line is inherently sensitive to TNF or not. Ultrasonically disrupted M. tuberculosis also has this property. The increased sensitivity is seen in the absence of metabolic inhibitors, although addition of emetine, an inhibitor of protein synthesis, causes the effect to manifest itself earlier and at a lower concentration of TNF. In contrast, infection with Mycobacterium bovis bacillus Calmette-Guerin induces little or no increased sensitivity to TNF, whereas Mycobacterium avium and M. tuberculosis H37Ra have intermediate sensitivities. We discuss the possibility that virulent tuberculosis strains produce a factor which distorts the normal protective function of TNF, rendering it toxic to host tissues and leading to the classical immunopathology of tuberculous lesions.
