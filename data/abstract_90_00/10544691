OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to explore the relationship between etiological factors, bacterial isolates and Escherichia coli susceptibility to antibiotics in ambulatory patients with urinary tract infection. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A prospective study was conducted in 13 private medical laboratories in France in March 1998. Data were collected on 658 cases involving 679 strains in ambulatory patients with urinary tract infections. Data on age, gender, catheter insertion within the 7 preceding days, and history of hospitalization, urinary infection and antibiotic treatment during the 6 preceding months were recorded. The distribution of the bacterial isolates and Eschericha coli sensitivity to ciprofloxacin, cotrimoxazole, and gentamycin were studied. RESULTS: E. coli was most frequently isolated in women, in patients with no catheter or without a history of antibiotic treatment, hospitalization or urinary infection. There was no difference in E. coli sensitivity according to sex and age in women. In patients with prior antibiotic treatment, all the tested antibiotics except gentamycin were significantly less active. In case of prior hospitalization, the E. coli isolates were more resistant to amoxicillin, quinolones, cotrimoxazole and gentamycin. The level of E. coli suceptibility rose as the delay since hospitalization or urinary infection increased. CONCLUSION: Ambulatory patients comprise a heterogeneous population requiring particular attention to correctly adapt therapeutic strategies.
