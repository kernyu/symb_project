We retrospectively studied 71 cases of lymph node tuberculosis confirmed by culture or pathology from 1983 to 1989. Young adults were most frequently involved and the female to male ratio was 3:2. of 71 patients, three-quarters presented with palpable masses and two-thirds were asymptomatic. The cervical nodes were most frequently involved. Roentgenographic evidence of pulmonary tuberculosis was detected in 42% of patients and sputum culture-positive tuberculosis occurred in 7%. Tuberculin skin testing is less useful in our country due to routine BCG vaccination during infancy and early childhood. Selective excisional biopsy in addition to clinical information was necessary for differential diagnosis. 48 patients received regular treatment and were followed up for at least 1 year. Fresh nodes or enlargement of existing nodes developed in 10% of patients during treatment. Residual nodes were present in 10% of patients at the end of 9-month treatment with rifampicin, isoniazid and ethambutol, including prolonged or modified regimens in some individuals. In conclusion, in areas with a high frequency of tuberculous strains presenting a primary resistance to isoniazid, a 9-month regimen of rifampicin, isoniazid and ethambutol is recommended for lymph node tuberculosis.
