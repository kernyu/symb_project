The phage type, antimicrobial resistance pattern, colicinogenic activity and DNA plasmid content of 172 strains of Salmonella typhimurium isolated in Rome from 1984 to 1986 were determined; 142 isolates were from patients with enteritis, 30 were from asymptomatic subjects. Most of the phage types identified were isolated during 2 or 3 of the study years; others, e.g., PT141, PT 204c and PT 194 were isolated during 1 year only, and only the last of these was isolated in large numbers. Phage typing proved most valuable in identifying epidemiologically related strains; DNA plasmid analysis was most useful in characterising further cultures of the same phage type, especially those isolated during suspected epidemics.
