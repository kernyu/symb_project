Using an in situ kinase assay we have identified kinases that are elevated in some multidrug resistant cells. Kinases were detected by measurement of 32P incorporation in proteins that were renatured after being subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes [Ferrell and Martin: J Biol Chem 264:20723-20729, 1989; Mol Cell Biol 10:3020-3026, 1990]. Kinases at 79, 84, and 92 kDa showed increased activity in the multidrug resistant human KB-V1 cells as compared to the sensitive parental KB-3-1 cells. The KB-V1 multidrug resistant cell line exhibited a 170 kDa membrane associated kinase activity that was not present in the parental drug sensitive line. The 170 kDa kinase activity was not affected by Ca++, phosphatidylserine, or cAMP, but was diminished after incubation in the presence of the kinase inhibitors staurosporine, K252a and KT5720. The 170 kDa kinase activity phosphorylated mainly threonine, with no evidence of tyrosine phosphorylation, and was not identical to either the multidrug resistance associated P-glycoprotein or the EGF receptor. Other multidrug resistant cell lines also showed elevated 170 kDa kinase activity, such as the human breast cancer MCF-7/Adr(R) and murine melanoma B16/Adr(R) cells, but the activity was not present in murine leukemia P-388 sensitive or multidrug resistant cells.
