This study describes the use of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect the tet(K) and tet(M) tetracycline resistance genes in Staphylococcus aureus. Primers based on the DNA sequence of the tet(K) and tet(M) genes from S. aureus were used as primers in the PCR assay to detect the presence of genes for resistance to tetracycline and minocycline. Two-hundred and fifteen isolates of S. aureus from Asian countries as Japan, Indonesia, China, Korea and Thailand were examined, and the results confirm that tet(K) specifies resistance to tetracycline but not to minocycline and tet(M) specifies resistance to both tetracycline and minocycline. We observed two different types of clinical isolates of S. aureus strains resistant to minocycline and tetracycline: the first carried only the tet(M) gene, while the second carried both the tet(M) and the tet(K) genes. Almost all of the clinical isolates of S. aureus resistant to minocycline and tetracycline from Indonesia, China and Thailand carried both tet(M) and tet(K) genes, while most of clinical isolates of S. aureuss from Japan and Korea carried only tet(M) gene.
