All 127 streptococci of serological group B isolated from bovines and humans were resistant to bacitracin (0.04 U) and gentamicin and susceptible to penicillin. Of the bovine isolates examined 10%, 8%, 22%, 2% and 30% were resistant to bacitracin (10 U), cefoxitin, clindamycin, erythromycin and tetracycline respectively. Of the human isolates 52%, 21%, 38%, 3% and 65% were resistant to bacitracin (10 U), cefoxitin, clindamycin, erythromycin and tetracycline respectively. Most of the bovine strains were susceptible, most of the human strains were resistant to bacitracin and tetracycline. A relation of tetracycline resistance to group B streptococcal microcapsule was proposed. Pigmentation studies revealed generally a weak pigmentation of bovine and a strong pigmentation of human group B streptococci. Antibiotic resistance patterns together with the ability to form a yellow to orange-red pigment might be used for characterization of individual cultures of group B streptococci.
