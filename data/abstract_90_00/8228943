Formalin-inactivated virus (FIV) and the detergent-treated virus (DTV) preparations were tested for their ability to enhance the resistance of mice to experimental influenza infection. FIV (100 micrograms) was administered intravenously to mice. After 24 hr, animals were challenged with 5 LD50 dose intranasally. FIV-treated and non-treated (control) mice had 10% and 100% mortality, respectively. Similar results were obtained with the DTV (40 micrograms) preparation. The pulmonary virus titer of FIV-treated mice was lower when compared with the control. Mechanisms other than acquired immunity may have conferred the early resistance to virus infection in mice.
