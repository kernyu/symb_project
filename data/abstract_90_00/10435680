Agar dilution minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) methodology, according to NCCLS guidelines, was used to test the activity of three glycopeptides (LY 333328 [LY], vancomycin [VAN], and teicoplanin [TEI]), four fluoroquinolones (trovafloxacin [TRO], BAY 12-8039 [BAY], ciprofloxacin [CIP], and ofloxacin [OFL]), five macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin antibiotics (erythromycin [ERY], azithromycin [AZI], miocamycin [MOM], clindamycin CLN], and quinupristin-dalfopristin [SYN] against 126 Streptococcus pneumoniae strains, isolated in Lozano Blesa Hospital of Zaragoza (Spain). MIC50/MIC90 (microg/ml) values for penicillin-susceptible (PS), penicillin-intermediate (PI) and penicillin-resistant (PR) strains show an excellent antipneumococcal activity of LY 333326--a new glycopeptide, for the fluoroquinolones trovafloxacin and moxifloxacin [BAY 12-8039], and for quinupristin/dalfopristin, regardless of the resistance phenotype of the strains.
