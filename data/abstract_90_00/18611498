The in vitro antimicrobial susceptibilities of 675 common enteropathogenic isolates from faecal specimens of patients with diarrhea (E. coli, Shigella, Salmonella and V. cholerae), and 568 E. coli isolates from faecal flora of healthy persons, which were collected as part of a National antibiotic resistance surveillance in Vietnam, were determined. The agar dilution method was used for the following nine antibiotics: ampicillin, doxycycline, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, nalidixic acid, kanamycin, trimethoprim, trimethoprim in combination with sulfamethoxazole (1/20), and sulfisomidin. Gentamicin was the most active of the antibiotics tested against all bacterial species with MICs in the range 0.125-4 mg/l. All strains were susceptible to nalidixic acid (0.125-8 mg/l) and more than 90% were susceptible to kanamycin. Among E. coli and Shigella isolates from patients the frequencies of resistance to commonly used antibiotics were high: ampicillin 73% and 84%, doxycycline 83% and 94%, chloramphenicol 71% and 91%, sulfisomidin 82% and 92%, respectively. Resistance to trimethoprin, as well as to the combination with sulfamethoxazole was found in 21% and 23%, respectively. The frequencies of multiple resistance (resistance to three or more antibiotics) were also high (77% and 89%, respectively). Less than 10% of Salmonellae and V. cholerae isolates were resistant to ampicillin, sulfisomidin or trimethoprim. Among E. coli from healthy people the frequencies of resistance were lower than in isolates from patients: ampicillin 23%, doxycycline 40%, chloramphenicol 21% and sulfisomidin 34%. However, the same patterns of multiple resistance were found in both groups.
