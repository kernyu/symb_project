A total of 117 isolates representing four Streptococcus species and 20 isolates representing two Enterococcus species from bovine mammary secretions were examined for resistance to streptomycin, kanamycin, and gentamicin. Resistance to streptomycin (85.4%) was most prevalent, followed by kanamycin (19%) and gentamicin (2.2%). Minimum inhibitory concentration of streptomycin for most organisms examined ranged from 16 to 250 micrograms/ml. For kanamycin, the minimum inhibitory concentration for most organisms was .5 to 62.5 micrograms/ml. Minimum inhibitory concentration for gentamicin was lower than for kanamycin. Two strains each of Streptococcus uberis and Enterococcus faecalis had minimum inhibitory concentration for streptomycin of greater than 2000 micrograms/ml, and two strains of E. faecalis had similar minimum inhibitory concentration for kanamycin. The minimum bactericidal concentration for all organisms was one to four times higher than minimum inhibitory concentration. None of the organisms evaluated was found to carry plasmids. Transfer of antibiotic resistance in plasmid-free strains was not achieved by mobilization with the aid of plasmid pAD1, indicating the absence of conjugative transposons. These data suggest that expression of aminoglycoside resistance of Streptococcus and Enterococcus species of bovine origin is likely due to factors other than plasmids or conjugative transposons.
