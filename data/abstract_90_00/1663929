Four fluoroquinolones were tested for antimicrobial activity against 300 isolates of staphylococci collected from medical centres throughout the United States. No cross-resistance to methicillin or oxacillin and the fluoroquinolones was observed. All four drugs were bactericidal agents and all ciprofloxacin-susceptible strains were inhibited at recommended breakpoint concentrations. Ciprofloxacin-resistant strains showed complete cross-resistance to the other fluoroquinolones. The relative potency of the study drugs as judged by MIC/MBC determinations was: temafloxacin greater than ciprofloxacin greater than ofloxacin greater than enoxacin.
