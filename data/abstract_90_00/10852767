Lipoxygenase (LO) and cytochrome P450 monooxygenase products of arachidonic acid (AA) have been implicated in a large number of vasoregulatory processes. In intact, blood-free, perfused and ventilated human lungs (n = 8), isolated during surgery for bronchial carcinoma, we analyzed leukotrienes (LTs), hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs), and epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) by sequential sampling of the recirculating buffer fluid. For the analysis we used multistep, solid-phase extraction, isocratic reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography, with elution of all metabolites within one run and photodiode array detection to obtain full UV spectra of eluting compounds. We detected no LT release in a 15-min baseline period, but the admixture of the calcium ionophore A23187 with the buffer fluid provoked the rapid appearance of all LTs. Some baseline release of 15-HETE was observed, and in response to A23187, maximum buffer concentrations were noted for 5-HETE, with 8-HETE, 9-HETE, 11-HETE, and 12-HETE being detected at lower levels. Marked baseline liberation of 11,12-EET and 8,9-EET was observed. In response to A23187, high oxirane buffer concentrations were registered, which far surpassed those of LTs and HETEs. The eicosanoid release was paralleled by a limited pulmonary artery pressor response and progressive vascular leakage. We conclude that ex-vivo-perfused human lungs release EETs > LTs > HETEs into the vascular compartment in response to inflammatory challenge. The marked oxirane synthesis in the lung vasculature may have major impact on lung vasoregulation when considering the possible function of these AA epoxides as endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factors.
