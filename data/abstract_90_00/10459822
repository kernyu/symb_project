Monotherapy with macrolides for the treatment of disseminated Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) bacteraemia leads to drug resistance and relapse of bacteraemia. Gastrointestinal intolerance is a common reason for treatment withdrawal of multidrug regimens. We have assessed the efficacy and safety of initial parenteral therapy together with a macrolide, for disseminated MAC infection, defined as two positive blood cultures, in AIDS patients. Patients received a daily infusion of amikacin 15 mg/kg + ethambutol 20 mg/kg + ciprofloxacin 400 mg/day, for 1 month, together with a macrolide by oral route. Fifteen patients were included and 13 (86%) achieved negative culture before the end of parenteral therapy.
