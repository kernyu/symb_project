A 71-year-old man with type I diabetes mellitus was admitted to the hospital for the treatment of osteomyelitis of the left great toe secondary to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. The patient was enrolled in an investigational protocol and was treated with teicoplanin 1200 mg/day. Following 40 days of treatment, the patient developed both markedly elevated serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen. Urine analysis also showed the presence of protein. The eosinophils were markedly elevated in the blood. The patient was subsequently diagnosed with a probable drug-induced acute interstitial nephritis. Treatment with furosemide and hemodialysis over the next two weeks failed to produce improvement in renal function. The patient was referred for long-term dialysis. The data presented in this report suggest the possible relationship of teicoplanin and the development of renal failure in this patient. Periodic monitoring of renal function and follow-up are probably warranted in patients receiving long-term teicoplanin therapy.
