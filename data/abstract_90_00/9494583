In order to better understand acquired resistance to antitumor agents in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), we investigated various drug resistance mechanisms; namely, topoisomerase II (topo II), glutathione system and P-glycoprotein (P-gp). Blast cells of 31 patients with AML, 21 before treatment (BT) and 10 at relapse (AR) were studied. Topo II was evaluated by Western blot analysis. Glutathione-S-transferase activity (GST) and glutathione content (GSH) were investigated by spectrophotometric assays. GST isoenzymes (-alpha, -mu and -pi) were tested by Western blot and by immunocytochemical staining. P-gp was evaluated by an immunocytochemical method using MRK 16 antibody. Our results showed that GST, GSH and GST-pi were similar in patients BT and AR GST-mu was detected in 13/21 AML BT and in 5/10 AML AR. GST-alpha expression was higher (p < 0.05) in AML AR (60 +/- 105 AU/mg) compared to AML BT (10 +/- 10 AU/mg). A relationship was found between GST-pi quantitation evaluated by Western blot and immunocytochemical staining, whereas no correlation was observed for the other isoenzymes. Topo II was detected in only 4 AML BT and 3 AML AR. Eleven out of 21 AML BT and 3/10 AML AR expressed P-gp with immunohistochemical study. These results indicate that only the "glutathione system", especially the GST-alpha could be involved in drug resistance in AML.
