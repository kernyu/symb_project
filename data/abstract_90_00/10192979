We studied the sensitivity of H. pylori to clarithromycin and metronidazole, as well as the sensitivity and specificity of H. pylori culture, urease test and histology on a sample of 166 Portuguese patients. We observed a prevalence of 5.8% resistance to clarithromycin and 60% resistance to metronidazole. The sensitivity and specificity for the diagnostic tests were: culture 98% and 100%, urease test 98% and 91%, histology 50% and 95%, respectively.
