An agent 9-beta-D-arabinofuranosyl-2-fluoroadenine (2-F-Ara-A) is a main metabolite of fludarabine, a fluorinated purine analogue with antitumor activity in lymphoproliferative malignancies. In this study, the mechanism responsible for the resistance of cancer cells to fludarabine was examined using the 2-F-Ara-A-resistant sublines JOK-1/F-Ara-A and L1210/F-Ara-A from a human hairy leukemic cell line (JOK-1) and a mouse leukemic cell line (L1210) respectively, which were established by continuous treatment of the parental cell lines with 2-F-AraA. JOK-1/F-Ara-A and L1210/F-Ara-A cells were more than 55 and 29 times more resistant to 2-F-Ara-A than were their parent cell lines, and showed a high cross-resistance to 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine but not to doxorubicin or vincristine. These resistant sublines intracellularly accumulated almost the same amount of 2-F-Ara-A as did their parent cell lines. However, the amount of 2-F-Ara-ATP, a cytotoxic metabolite of 2-F-Ara-A, decreased by 2.6% (JOK-1/F-Ara-A C3), 6% (L1210/F-Ara-A C1) and 3.7% (L1210/F-Ara-A C7) relative to the levels in the parent cell lines. Enzymatically, these resistant cells hardly activated deoxycytidine (dCyd) and 2-F-Ara-A. In addition, the abilities to phosphorylate deoxyadenosine and deoxyguanosine were also decreased in the resistant cells in comparison with the parent cells. These findings suggest that the deficiency in activity of dCyd kinase may contribute to the resistance of 2-F-Ara-A.
