Eleven clinical isolates of Klebsiella oxytoca from Stockholm hospitals were found to be resistant to aztreonam and cefuroxime, but susceptible to cefotaxime, ceftazidime and imipenem. Resistance could be overcome by combining the beta-lactams with the inhibitor clavulanic acid. Crude beta-lactamase preparations from the isolates inactivated aztreonam and cefuroxime rapidly. By isoelectric focusing, a single common beta-lactamase of pI 5.25 was detected. The K. oxytoca isolates belonged to three subgroups, based on their plasmid profiles and Bg/II restriction endonuclease digestion of plasmid DNA. It was concluded that resistance to aztreonam and cefuroxime in these isolates was conferred by a beta-lactamase distinct from TEM-1, TEM-2 and SHV-1, but possibly derived from TEM-like enzymes.
