Lacticin 3147 is a broad-spectrum bacteriocin produced by Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis DPC3147 which is bactericidal against a range of mastitis-causing streptococci and staphylococci. In this study, both lacticin 3147 and the lantibiotic nisin were separately incorporated into an intramammary teat seal product. The seal containing lacticin 3147 exhibited excellent antimicrobial activity and might form the basis of an improved treatment for the prevention of mastitis in dry cows.
