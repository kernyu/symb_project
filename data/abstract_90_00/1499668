The vector potential of houseflies (Musca domestica) for Klebsiella spp. was investigated. Klebsiella spp. (mostly Klebsiella pneumoniae) were isolated from 36.7% of hospital flies and 28.1% of infected wounds of patients. Antibiograms of Klebsiella spp. showed that 82.0% of isolates from hospital flies and 96.3% from infected wounds were resistant to four or more commonly used antimicrobials. In contrast, from the control group, only 8.7% klebsiella isolates showed similar antimicrobial resistance pattern (P less than 0.001). Similar strains of Klebsiella spp. were encountered among patients and hospital houseflies. The results indicate that flies in the hospital environs are potential vectors of hospital resistant strains of Klebsiella spp.
