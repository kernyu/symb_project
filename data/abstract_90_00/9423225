Routine antimicrobial resistance testing of Helicobacter pylori is more commonly performed since the correlation between metronidazole resistance and failure to eradicate using this drug, has been made. While resistance testing of H. pylori by Etest is simple to perform, it is expensive compared to disk diffusion methods. In this study the Etest was compared with a modified Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion (NCCLS) method for routine resistance screening of H. pylori. Fifty one pre-treatment isolates were tested against amoxycillin, metronidazole, tetracycline and erythromycin by both Etest and disk diffusion using NCCLS guideline strength disks. Clarithromycin was tested by Etest only. Nitroimidazole and macrolide resistance were detected using the modified Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method which correlated with Etest minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). Resistance rates were 49% for metronidazole and 8% for clarithromycin. Cross resistance occurs with macrolides against H. pylori and allows testing of erythromycin to predict resistance to clarithromycin. The very low MICs obtained with H. pylori against amoxycillin and tetracycline require the use of Etest or lower strength disk methods to be used.
