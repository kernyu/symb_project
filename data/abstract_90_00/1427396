The major limitation to curative therapy for ovarian cancer is the development of drug resistance. Cyclosporin A (CsA), an immunosuppressive agent that has been used extensively in organ transplantation, also has been shown to decrease the resistance of cancer cells to some chemotherapeutic agents. Since cisplatin (CDDP) is the most common drug used for the treatment of ovarian cancer, we evaluated the potential of CsA to decrease resistance to CDDP in ovarian cancer cells selected for resistance to CDDP (A2780-CDDP). Although CsA significantly increased the sensitivity of A2780-CDDP cells to cytolysis by CDDP it did not increase CDDP sensitivity in the CDDP-sensitive parent cells (A2780), that is, CsA did not decrease basal resistance to CDDP. Both A2780-CDDP and A2780 are sensitive to cytolysis by Adriamycin (ADR). CsA significantly decreased the basal resistance of both cell lines to ADR. Interestingly, the effect of the protein synthesis inhibitors, emetine and cycloheximide, was similar to that of CsA, suggesting that CsA decreased selected resistance to CDDP and decreased basal resistance to ADR by affecting a protein synthesis-dependent resistance mechanism(s). In contrast to CsA and protein synthesis inhibitors, buthionine sulfoximine, an inhibitor of glutathione synthesis, decreased basal resistance of both cell lines to cytolysis by CDDP but not ADR, while verapamil, an inhibitor of P-glycoprotein, had no effect on cytolysis in either cell line. These results suggest that CsA may not decrease resistance to CDDP or ADR-mediated cytolysis by reducing glutathione or by inhibiting P-glycoprotein.
