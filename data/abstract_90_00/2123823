Susceptibility or resistance to infection with Leishmania major correlates with the ability of mice to produce characteristic panels of lymphokines in response to the parasite. To investigate the role of antigen-presenting cells in this phenomenon, we developed a model system which used congenic (H-2d) susceptible and resistant mice. L. major-specific T cells were isolated from infected BALB/c and B10.D2 mice, and the cells were restimulated in vitro on syngenic or congenic antigen-presenting cells. BALB/c L. major-reactive T cells restimulated with either antigen-presenting cell produced high levels of interleukin-4 and low levels of gamma interferon. In contrast, T cells from B10.D2 mice produced gamma interferon. Radiation-induced chimeras reconstituted with BALB/c bone marrow also produced more interleukin-4 in response to L. major than did chimeras reconstituted with B10.D2 bone marrow. To test whether this pattern of cytokine secretion was unique to infection with L. major, we infected the mice with a second intracellular pathogen, Mycobacterium bovis BCG. Mycobacterium-specific T cells from both BALB/c and B10.D2 mice produced interleukin-2 and no interleukin-4. Finally, when BALB/c mice were vaccinated with avirulent L. major, the induced resistance correlated with reduced production of interleukin-4 but no increase in gamma interferon production. Instead, T cells from the vaccinated mice produced high levels of tumor necrosis factor. This suggests that tumor necrosis factor, in addition to gamma interferon, may be involved in resistance to L. major and that interleukin-4 may inhibit the leishmanicidal activity of tumor necrosis factor and/or gamma interferon.
