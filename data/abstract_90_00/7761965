The conjunctival bacterium flora was examined during the preoperative and postoperative treatment of 200 patients who underwent intraocular surgery. Brulamycin eye drops (15 mg tobramycinum in 5 ml solution) were given to 100 patients and Oculogutta neomycin (50 mg neomycinum sulfuricum in 100 ml solution) to 100 patients. The effectivity, objective and subjective side-effects of the two drugs, and resistance to the drugs were examined. On the basis of comparative data and the observations of the authors, Brulamycin eye drops are recommended for the premedication of intraocular surgery.
