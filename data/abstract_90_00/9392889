Two new (3 and 5), as well as three known (1, 2, and 4), polyynes were isolated from Devil's Club (Oplopanax horridus; Araliaceae), a medicinal plant of North America. The structures were established by 1H and 13C NMR. The absolute configurations of 2 and 5 were determined by application of Mosher's method. All the polyynes exhibited significant anti-Candida, antibacterial, and antimycobacterial activity, with an ability to kill Mycobacterium tuberculosis and isoniazid-resistant Mycobacterium avium at 10 micrograms/disk in a disk diffusion assay.
