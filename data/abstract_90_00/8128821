We describe a case of meningitis due to Cryptococcus neoformans var gattii in an AIDS patient. The reasons for the observed predominance of C. neoformans var neoformans infections in AIDS patients living in areas endemic for the gattii variety are not understood thus far. Treatment with fluconazole resulted in poor clinical and mycological response. In vitro sensitivity testing of the fungus revealed high minimal inhibitory concentrations, suggesting fluconazole resistance. Treatment with amphotericin B was successful.
