Fifty-five Escherichia coli strains isolated from 55 diarrhoeic goat kids from 13 flocks in Spain were serotyped and investigated for production of enterotoxins (LT and STa), verotoxins (VT1 and VT2), cytotoxic necrotizing factors (CNF1 and CNF2), alpha-hemolysin (Hly) and enterohemolysin (EntHly), and for antibiotic resistance. Only 3 (5%) strains were toxigenic: 1 VT1+EntHly+ (serogroup O8) and 2 CNF2+ (both of serogroup O153). The strains serotyped belonged to 19 serogroups. However, 31 (56%) were of one nine serogroups (O3, O8, O9, O10, O11, O21, O44, O103 and O153) and only three of them (O8, O9 and O11) accounted for 29% of the strains. The highest percentages of antibiotic resistance in order of frequency were: streptomycin (93%), sulfadiazine (89%), tetracyline (84%), kanamycin (82%), neomycin (82%) and ampicillin (69%). We conclude that E. coli strains isolated from diarrhoeic goat kids are usually non-toxigenic and belong to a large number of serogroups.
