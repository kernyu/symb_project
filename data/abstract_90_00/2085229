Streptococcal species isolated from dairy cows with clinical mastitis were obtained from mastitis research workers in Florida, Louisiana, New York, Vermont, Washington, and West Virginia. Seventy-one streptococcal isolates were tested, including 39 strains of Streptococcus agalactiae, 21 strains of S dysgalactiae, and 11 strains of S uberis. The minimal inhibitory concentration of erythromycin, lincomycin, oxytetracycline, penicillin, spectinomycin, streptomycin, and tetracycline was determined for each isolate. Differences were not detected among strains with respect to geographic origin. None of the strains was resistant to penicillin. Lincomycin was the next most effective antimicrobial, with only 2 resistant strains of each streptococcal species. There were no differences among the streptococcal species with respect to resistance to either penicillin or lincomycin. Streptococcus uberis was more likely to be resistant to erythromycin than were S agalactiae and S dysgalactiae (P less than 0.02). Streptococcus agalactiae and S uberis had similar distributions for resistance to oxytetracycline, tetracycline, spectinomycin, and streptomycin. Strains of S dysgalactiae were more likely to have intermediate resistance to oxytetracycline and streptomycin than were strains of S agalactiae and S uberis, which were highly resistant to oxytetracycline and streptomycin (P less than 0.001). Differences were not detected among the streptococcal species with respect to resistance to spectinomycin. Resistance to multiple antimicrobials was observed in all streptococcal species tested. Although S dysgalactiae appeared to have a greater percentage of strains (73%) that were resistant to multiple antimicrobials than did S agalactiae (31%) or S uberis (45%), differences were not statistically significant.
