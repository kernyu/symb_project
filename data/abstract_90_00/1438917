The susceptibility to imipenem of 213 clinical strains of Gram-negative rods resistant to six cephalosporins (cephradine, cefamandole, cefuroxime, cefotaxime, cefoperazone and ceftriaxone) has been studied. It was found that 93.9% of the strains were sensitive and 6.1% were resistant to imipenem. In the examined group 64 (30%) out of 213 strains were simultaneously resistant to four aminoglycosides (gentamycin, tobramycin, netilmicin and amikacin); among them 5 (7.8%) strains were resistant to imipenem. Sensitivity to imipenem 157 out of 213 examined strains as compared to that of ceftazidime was as follows: 29.3% of the strains were sensitive and 3.8% resistant to both of the antibiotics, whilst 64.3% were imipenem-sensitive and ceftazidime-resistant. In vitro imipenem proved to be very active antibiotic against over 90% of multiresistant Gram-negative rods.
