Pus aspirated from acute suppurative oral infections in 78 patients (age range 13-76 years) yielded a total of 331 bacterial strains consisting of 143 facultative anaerobes (predominantly Streptococcus spp.) and 188 strict anaerobes (predominantly Prevotella spp.). Seventy-five isolates (23%) were resistant to penicillin (MIC > 1 mg/L), 37 (11%) were resistant to ampicillin (MIC > 2 mg/L) and 16 (5%) isolates were resistant to amoxycillin/clavulanic acid (MIC > 2 mg/L). Samples from 43 (55%) of the patients yielded at least one penicillin resistant isolate and within this group 30 samples (73%) contained at least one strain which produced beta-lactamase. A history of antibiotic therapy during the 6 months before enrollment in the study did not influence the isolation of penicillin resistant bacteria. It is concluded that penicillin resistant bacteria are often present in the microflora of acute dental infection.
