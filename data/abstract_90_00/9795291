The use of quinolones has increased remarkably in recent years. Monitoring the trends in the consumption of these antibiotics is essential for the assessment of bacterial resistance. Sales figures for this group of antibiotics for each province from 1985 through 1993 were obtained from the medication database at the Spanish Ministry of Health. The consumption in milligrams per inhabitant older than 15 were calculated for each province and year. Specific time trends in consumption for Spain were studied and provincial maps were made representing consumption in milligrams per person older than 15. Outpatient prescriptions of quinolones increased 155% between 1985 and 1993 in Spain, more than 2 tons per year. Seven of the eight provinces in Andalucia were among the ten provinces with greater consumption. A south-north pattern was detected from year to year. Important increases were observed in all the Spanish provinces. Further studies should consider this fact in the monitoring of antimicrobial resistance and should assess if provincial differences in consumption correlate with the prevalence of the infectious diseases treated with this group of antibiotics.
