Prophylactic treatment with human granulocyte colony stimulating factor (hG-CSF) affords significant protection against systemic infections caused by C. albicans in cyclophosphamide-treated but not in cortisone-treated mice. Localized candidosis in neutropenic mice does not respond to hG-CSF. Our data show that granulocytes play an important role in the immune defence against deep mycoses, but not against local infections. From our data it is reasonable to assume that prophylactic treatment with hG-CSF may augment the resistance of immunosuppressed patients to deep Candida infection, but it would be of little help against oral candidosis of HIV patients.
