The multiplication of Mycobacterium leprae in foot pads of experimentally-infected mice was suppressed by intramuscular administration of ampicillin combined with sulbactam or YTR-830H, two potent inhibitors of beta-lactamase in the bacteria. The antibiotic or the inhibitors by themselves were inactive. Ampicillin/sulbactam also inhibited the growth of drug-resistant M. leprae which grew in the presence of rifampin or dapsone. The finding provides a new approach to treat leprosy and to overcome drug resistance of the mycobacteria.
