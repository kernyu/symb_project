The activity of various antibacterial agents (amoxicillin, josamycin, doxycycline and metronidazole) was established in vitro using a rapid micromethod. The activity of these agents, which are widely used in oral medicine, was evaluated against microorganisms responsible for periodontitis and bucco-dental infections. Their action against alpha-hemolytic streptococci (including pneumococci) which make up the majority of the indigenous oral flora was also tested. Amoxicillin was found to be effective against all the strains tested. Doxycycline was active against periodontal bacteria, but not against 50% of the streptococcal flora. Josamycin was found to be effective against streptococci, but appeared without effect on Eikenella corrodens and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. Metronidazole, inactive against streptococci, displayed greater activity towards the strict anaerobes. The use of these antibiotics for the treatment of bucco-dental infections, especially periodontitis, is discussed. For periodontitis and periodontal suppurations, antimicrobial agents present a valuable adjunct to local treatments such as scaling or rootplaning. This may prevent more serious infections such as endocarditis that can develop after tooth extraction.
