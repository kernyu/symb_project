Human melanoma cells were grown to exponential and stationary phases showing melanin contents of 4.2 +/- 0.3 and 11.3 +/- 0.6 micrograms/10(6) cells, respectively. The cells were separated in four subpopulations by a Percoll gradient; the subpopulation of density 1.07 (g/ml) was the most enriched in pigmented cells and produced 28 and 58% of the cells in exponential and stationary phases, respectively. Melanoma cells had similar superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase activities in exponential and stationary phases. Moreover melanoma cells exhibited a higher catalase activity in the stationary phase: whole homogenate and cytosol activities were 7.0 +/- 0.3 and 10.8 +/- 0.6 U/mg protein, whereas in exponential phase the activities were 4.9 +/- 0.1 and 7.6 +/- 0.3 U/mg protein for whole homogenate and cytosol, respectively. The intracellular H2O2 steady-state concentration was 3.3 +/- 0.2 and 2.1 +/- 0.2 microM H2O2 for exponential and stationary phases, respectively. The spontaneous chemiluminescence of the two culture phases was 169 +/- 27 cps/10(6) cells (exponential) and 78 +/- 24 cps/10(6) cells (stationary). The cytotoxicity of H2O2 generated extracellularly by glucose oxidase was determined after 60 min of exposure. IC50 values for exponential and stationary cell cultures were 0.9 and 2.4 mU/ml of glucose oxidase, respectively. The increased catalase activities in the stationary phase as compared with the exponential phase are consistent with the decreased intracellular H2O2, with the decreased spontaneous chemiluminescence, and with the increased resistance to exogenous H2O2.
