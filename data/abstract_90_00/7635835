cysB and cysE strains were obtained as spontaneous mecillinam-resistant mutants of Salmonella typhimurium. The resistance to mecillinam was caused by the cys mutations which also conferred tolerance to lethal cell shape mutations. Most, but not all, cysB and cysE mutations from other origins displayed the same behavior. Resistance was abolished by O- and N-acetylserine in cysE mutants; by thiosulfate, sulfite, and sulfide in cysB mutants; and by cysteine in both types of mutants. It is concluded that an event involved in mecillinam action requires the inducer and the activator protein of the cysteine regulon.
