Infections which are difficult to cure are mainly caused by resistant organisms or opportunistic pathogens. For the treatment of such infections, we should maximize drug's therapeutic potentials, and minimize its toxicity. Characteristics of pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics in antimicrobials should be taken into account to maximize the efficacy and to minimize the toxicity. Bactericidal activity and post-antibiotic effect of antimicrobials are the major factors to determine the optimal dosing. Infections caused by intra-phagocytic pathogens should be treated with drugs which penetrate cell well. Early treatment with antimicrobials is the corner-stone for the treatment of infections in immunocompromised host. It is very important to determine which of the two drugs should be given first to maximize the efficacy on combination therapy.
