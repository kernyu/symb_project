The ability of 46 strains of Pseudomonas cepacia to inhibit phytopathogenic fungi and the effect of iron on their antifungal activity were studied. The antifungal effect of the bacteria and the antimicrobial activity of their crude yellow and violet pigments showed a 4-5-fold decrease in the presence of Fe(III). The addition of 100 micrograms/ml of FeCl3 to the medium decreased the biosynthesis of violet and yellow pigments; the complex of the yellow pigment with Fe(III) promoted the growth of the P. cepacia producing strain under iron-deficient conditions. The data obtained suggest a participation of some P. cepacia pigments in iron transport. The resistance of the P. cepacia strains to the synthetic chelating agents hydroxyethylenediphosphonic and diethylenediaminepentaacetic acids was demonstrated, which may indicate a high Fe(III)-binding constant of P. cepacia siderophores.
