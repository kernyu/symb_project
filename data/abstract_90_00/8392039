PURPOSE: To investigate the role of externally facing membrane protein sulfhydryl groups in controlling lens permeability and transparency using the impermeant sulfhydryl complexing agent p-chloromercuriphenyl sulfonate (pCMPS). METHODS: Membrane permeability changes were studied by measuring lens voltage and resistance. Ion movements were monitored by measuring 22Na+ and 45Ca2+ fluxes, and internal free calcium was monitored by ion-selective microelectrodes. Opacification was quantified by photographing and analyzing back-scattered light. RESULTS: pCMPS, at concentrations above 1 microM, produced a depolarization of membrane potential and decrease in membrane resistance. These changes were accompanied by a marked stimulation in 22Na+ and 45Ca2+ influxes into the lens. There was a concomitant loss of lens transparency, mainly in the bow region. The pCMPS-induced electrical changes could be prevented by substituting N-methyl-D-glucamine for Na+ in the external medium. Na(+)-free solution alone increased 45Ca2+ influx, and the addition of pCMPS further stimulated the influx. Quinine (300 microM) was found to reduce the pCMPS-induced stimulation of 22Na+ and 45Ca2+ influxes and also to reduce opacification. CONCLUSIONS: pCMPS at low concentrations induces many of the cation permeability changes previously found to occur with age and cataract in the lens. The fact that quinine can ameliorate pCMPS-induced changes in ion movements and opacification suggests a novel approach for membrane-based anticataract strategies.
