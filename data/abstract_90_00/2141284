The influence of micelles of sodium dodecyl sulfate, cetyltrimethylammonium bromide, lysophosphatidylcholine and dodecylphosphorylcholine on the content and stability of the ordered structure of human beta-endorphin and its 12-26 fragment has been investigated. The structure was determined by far-ultraviolet circular dichroism and the stability by the resistance of the polypeptide to proteolysis with trypsin and chymotrypsin, monitored by HPLC. The alpha-helix inducing effects of the amphipathic compounds were in the order anionic greater than zwitterionic greater than cationic. The protection against proteolysis was very marked, especially for trypsin, and it was proportional to the alpha-helix inducing potential of amphipathic compounds. However, the lower resistance to proteolysis of the highly structured 12-26 fragment suggests that factors other than secondary structure may be responsible for the resistance to proteolysis.
