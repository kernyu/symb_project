Previous results from this laboratory have shown the preservation of non-MHC-restricted, constitutive oncolytic activity of human peripheral blood NK cells in the elderly as assessed by the chromium release assay which quantitates the lytic endpoint at the cell population level. We have now addressed this senescence-related change at single-cell level using 101 blood samples. Both the efficiency of the initial tumor target binding step i.e., recognition of K562, the NK-sensitive erythroleukemia cell line, as well as the ability of NK cells to deliver lethal hit are highly conserved during healthy aging. In fact, the elderly exhibit a statistically significant, moderately higher frequency of active killers among circulating lymphocytes. Analyzed in another way, a majority of "high NK responders" were found to be older donors, while none in the "low NK responders" group were > 70 years old. Gamma interferon, a gene product as well as an autocrine activator of NK cells, is effective in converting non-lytic "pre-NK" cells to active killers at single-cell level. This in vitro cytokine sensitivity of NK cells is unaltered during immune senescence. The intactness of the NK cell's capacity to be modulated may be vital in both tumor resistance and host viral defenses of aged humans.
