Acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (AECB) result in increased morbidity and mortality. The role of bacteria in AECB, the importance of antimicrobial therapy, and the choice of antimicrobial agents have been debated for decades. Fortunately, within the past few years, a number of studies and one consensus statement have been reported that have increased the understanding of the role of bacteria in AECB and suggest approaches in selecting antimicrobial therapy. This article will review these studies and present an empiric approach in treating AECB based upon the patient's presenting findings, related risk factors, and potential antimicrobial resistance patterns that may be encountered.
