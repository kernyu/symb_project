Between September 1989 and February 1991, strains of S. typhi showing multiple drug resistance were isolated from blood cultures of patients with typhoid fever. A total of 283 isolates were obtained over a period of 18 months. Forty four (11%) of these isolates were resistant to chloramphenicol, ampicillin, co-trimoxazole and tetracycline, the first three being drugs currently used in treating typhoid fever. Forty of the 44 multi-resistant strains tested showed transfer of resistance 'en block' to recipient Escherichia coli K 12 (J62-2). All 44 multi-resistant strains were sensitive to ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin. Since the resistance is plasmid-mediated, the problem is likely to get aggravated.
