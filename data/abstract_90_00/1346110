An intracellular staining procedure for the cytoskeletal marker, glial fibrillary acidic protein of astrocytes, has been developed which allows flow cytometric phenotyping of astrocytes within complex mixtures of glial cells. Employing this technique, we show here that measles virus infection of rat mixed glial cell cultures results in a rapid augmentation of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and ICAM-1 on the majority of astrocytes in culture. MHC class I levels are increased on macrophages/microglia but ICAM-1 expression is not normally affected on this cell type. Some MHC class II induction is also observed after virus infection but only on astrocytes. A type-I interferon (IFN)-inducible protein, Mx, was identified in cultured glial cells after infection. Qualitatively comparable MHC class I and ICAM-1 enhancement after addition of type-I IFN, supports the conclusion that this cytokine(s) released as a result of virus infection, is responsible for alterations in the expression of molecules on glial cells, that are involved in T cell recognition. Astrocytes after viral infection were more susceptible to alloantigen-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes and cytotoxic T lymphocyte activity was substantially reduced in the presence of mAb specific for MHC class I, ICAM-1 and LFA-1 but not MHC class II. The relevance of these findings to T cell recognition of virus-infected cells in the central nervous system is discussed.
