Bacterial strains (219) isolated from newborn children were studied for their sensitivity to 17 antibiotics. In the case of the species studied the increase of resistance to cephalothin, cefazolin, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, gentamicin, tobramycin, chloramphenicol by 5.7 to 43% was found. This evidenced for a necessity to revise the tactics of their further use for treatment and prophylaxis, while the identification of the strains resistant to ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin evidenced for the appearance of new resistance determinants. The high level of resistance to antibiotics and practically identical profile of antibiotics in the strains isolated from newborns and epidemiologically significant environmental objects in the examined hospitals do point to possible colonization of newborns by the hospital strains.
