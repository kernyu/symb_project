Evidence linking antimicrobial use with resistance is compelling on the local, national, and international levels. That resistance levels can be influenced by changing patterns of use also seems clear. We must now determine how, as a global society, to best use the resource of antimicrobials and how to protect novel compounds that are just now becoming available from emerging resistance. We must act not only within the arena of human use but also on use in animals and for crops.
