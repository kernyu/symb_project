Ten% cefdinir (CFDN, FK482) granular preparation, a new oral cephalosporin preparation intended for children, was given to children with various infections. The results obtained are summarized as follows. 1. Ten% CFDN granules were administered to a total of 21 children with upper or lower respiratory tract infections, urinary tract infections or infectious impetigo at daily doses of 6.4-18 mg/kg divided into 3 portions. Clinical efficacies were "excellent" in 13 patients, "good" in 7 patients and "unknown" in 1 patient (viral infection), hence an efficacy of 100% was obtained. 2. Bacteria identified in various disease cases included 19 strains of 7 species, and the eradication rate was 100%. 3. No side effects were noted in any of the children. Laboratory test results showed an abnormality in 1 case with eosinophilia. These results suggest that 10% CFDN granules as well as 5% CFDN granules may be a very useful and safe drug for the treatment of pediatric infections.
