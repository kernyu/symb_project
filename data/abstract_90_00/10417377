The critical role of cellular immunity in resistance to infectious diseases is glaringly revealed by life-threatening infections if T cell function is disrupted by an inherited or acquired immunodeficiency. Although treatment has historically focused on infectious complications, understanding of the cellular and molecular basis of immunodeficiency and technologies useful for enhancing cellular immunity have both been rapidly evolving. A new era of molecular and cellular therapy is emerging as approaches to correct abnormal genes, the loss of T cell subpopulations, and aberrant T cell homeostasis make the transition from bench to bedside.
