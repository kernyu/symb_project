Nearly 23 per cent of 3000 randomly selected sheep farmers returned questionnaires on strategies to control the development of anthelmintic resistance. Twenty-five per cent stated that they regularly checked the accuracy of their drenching gun, and 52 per cent stated that they weighed a few animals and treated the whole flock like the heaviest. The mean annual frequency of dosing lambs was 4.39 compared with 2.43 for ewes. Forty-eight per cent stated that they changed the anthelmintic group annually. Seventeen per cent always treated sheep brought on to their farm with ivermectin. However, only 7 per cent had had their flocks tested for anthelmintic-resistant nematodes. The responses suggest that most sheep farmers are not actively seeking to prevent the development and spread of anthelmintic-resistant nematodes.
