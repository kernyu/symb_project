In order to evaluate the in vitro activity of fleroxacin against nosocomial gram-negative organisms, 263 multiresistant gram-negative bacilli (203 Enterobacteriaceae and 60 non-fermenting gram-negative bacilli) were isolated from adult patients with nosocomial infections. The different patterns of resistance to eight different antimicrobial agents (ampicillin, carbenicillin, piperacillin, cephalothin, cefamandole, ceftazidime, gentamicin and amikacin) were determined by minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), using the agar dilution method. The most prevalent multiresistant species isolated were Klebsiella pneumoniae (28.9%), Escherichia coli (24%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (12.2%). All these bacterial strains showed three to five resistance patterns to at least three different antibiotics. Resistance to ceftazidime was observed in at least one of the resistance patterns of isolated bacteria. The activity of fleroxacin against multiresistant enteric bacteria was excellent; these strains showed a susceptibility of 79-100%. The susceptibility of P. aeruginosa to antipseudomonal agents was low; however, the activity of fleroxacin against these strains was higher than 60% (MIC < or = 2 microg/ ml), broadly comparable with ciprofloxacin. The resistance to fluoroquinolones detected in this study was no cause for alarm (3%). Consequently, fleroxacin maintains a remarkable activity against Enterobacteriaceae and remains highly active against other gram-negative bacilli. Nevertheless, actions directed at preventing or limiting resistance will be crucial to maintain the viability of fluoroquinolones as important therapeutic agents.
