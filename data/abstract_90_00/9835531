We examined 22 clinical isolates of Staphylococcus epidermidis to analyze the association of alterations in GyrA and ParC with fluoroquinolone resistance. The simultaneous presence of GyrA and ParC alterations was associated with a high level of fluoroquinolone resistance in the clinical isolates of S. epidermidis.
