The objective of this study was to determine the evolution of the species distribution and the prevalence of resistance to the Enterococcus genus. We studied 281 strains of enterococcus isolated from blood samples: 90 throughout 1984 and 791 from the years 1994 to 1996. identification was made using PosCombo 4Y Microscan-Baxter dehydrated panels and the Rapid ID 32 Strep system (bioMerieux). The MICs were calculated using the agar dilution method according to recommendations of the NCCLS for the following antibiotics: ampicillin, vancomycin, teicoplanin, gentamicin, kanamycin and streptomycin. The production of betalactamases were evaluated using a paper disk with nitrocefin for all the strains. The genotypes with resistance to glycopeptides were determined using PCR. The percentage of E. faecalis for 1984-1986/1994-1996 was 82.2/79.4; of E. faecium 4.4/16.4; and other species 12.214.3. The resistance to ampicillin went from 1.1% to 5.8%; high level resistance to glycopeptides went from 0% to 9.9%; for low level from 7.7% to 2.6%; resistance to a high charge of gentamicin went from 27.7% to 40.8%; and that for kanamycin from 45.5% to 62.8%. Resistance to streptomycin remained constant (45.5%). No strains produced betalactamases. For the species E. faecium, a statistically significant increase was detected for global resistance to ampicillin, gentamicin and kanamycin, with resistance to streptomycin remaining at similar percentages. No high level resistance to glycopeptides was detected in the first time period, but the low level resistance was greater.
