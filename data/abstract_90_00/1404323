A collection of 86 strains of Salmonella of serotype Typhimurium isolated from children with gastroenteritis in Tehran, Iran was examined for biochemical phenotype, phage type and antibiotic-resistance pattern. Twenty-seven biochemical phenotypes (BPTs), 14 discrete phage types (PTs) and 18 resistotypes (RTs) were identified. Fifty-three strains (62%) belonged to two major and probably related BPTs, whereas the other 33 isolates belonged to less common BPTs. The two predominant BPTs contained 26 strains of the same PT and 23 strains of the same RT. Different PTs and RTs of strains with similar BPT were sometimes observed, possibly reflecting antibiotic pressures in Iran. These results suggest that two major "clones" of Typhimurium strains are particularly common in Iran and, although each method alone adequately detected these and other less common "clones", biochemical fingerprinting provided additional information about relationships among strains.
