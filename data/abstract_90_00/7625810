The activity of a new prototype carbapenem, L-695,256, against clinical isolates of gram-positive and gram-negative aerobes was studied in vitro by agar dilution. L-695,256 was highly active against methicillin-resistant and -susceptible isolates of staphylococci (MICs, 0.016 to 2 micrograms/ml) and against penicillin-resistant pneumococci (MICs, 0.016 to 0.064 micrograms/ml), irrespective of penicillin susceptibility. Activity against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae was less than that of imipenem, while Proteus mirabilis and Morganella morganii were more susceptible to L-695,256.
