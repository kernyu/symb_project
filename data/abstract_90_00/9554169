Chocolate agar with teicoplanin disk (30 micrograms) was used for the isolation of Haemophilus strains. Fifty strains of 3 Haemophilus species grew as well in the inhibition zones of teicoplanin disks as on teicoplanin containing selective plates, whereas Gram-positive bacteria failed to form colonies. This selective method proved especially advantageous when Haemophilus strains were isolated from mixed bacterial cultures of 665 specimens.
