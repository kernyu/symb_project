The statistical analysis of 529 compounds belonging to the group of cephalosporins revealed a significant influence of oxygen-containing descriptors of the radical at position 7 in the cefem nucleus on the biological activity of the compounds. It was concluded that prediction of the antimicrobial properties of the antibiotics by the pattern recognition was possible with using factors reflecting the presence and space arrangement of the following functional groups in the cephalosporin molecules:-OH (phenolic group), C-O-C (ether), C = O (ester, amide) and -O- (in the heterocycle). The results of the study were compared with the data on the impact of nitrogen-containing descriptors on the biological activity of cephalosporins and practical recommendations for synthesis of new active compounds were proposed.
