The in vitro activities of PD127391 and the new fluorinated-4-quinolone, PD131628, were compared with each other and with five similar fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin, enoxacin, fleroxacin, norfloxacin, and ofloxacin). A total of 844 isolates mainly from recent clinical bacteremias and additional stock strains with well-characterized resistance mechanisms were tested. PD127391 had slightly more activity than PD131628 (90% minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC90)] 0.008-0.12) against the Enterobacteriaceae, but both were two- to fourfold more potent than ciprofloxacin. PD131628 activity was equal to or greater than PD127391 when tested against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. PD127391 showed greatest activity against Bacteroides fragilis group strains (MIC90, 2 micrograms/ml) when compared with PD131628 (MIC90 greater than 8 micrograms/ml). Both PD127391 (MIC90s, 0.015-1.0 micrograms/ml) and PD131628 (MIC90s, 0.03 - greater than 8 micrograms/ml) were more active than ciprofloxacin against Gram-positive organisms. Altering the medium pH, adding divalent cations (magnesium), and increasing the inoculum concentration to 10(6) colony-forming units per spot adversely effected the activity of both PD127391 and PD131628. Resistance selection and mutational rates to resistance were identical to previously studied drugs in their class.
