We have treated 17 refractory or relapsed multiple myeloma patients resistant to chemotherapy with thalidomide at a dose of 200-800 mg/day. Eleven patients responded, five of whom had a very good partial response (> 75% decline in M protein) and another five exhibited a partial response (> 50% decline in M protein). Except for one patient, treatment was well tolerated with only mild side-effects. Thalidomide should be included in the therapeutic options for refractory myeloma.
