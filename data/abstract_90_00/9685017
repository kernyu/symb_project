PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that Pseudomonas aeruginosa that have been internalized in Acanthamoeba are protected against the action of contact lens disinfecting solutions. METHODS: The experiments were divided into two parts. First, five commercially available disinfecting solutions, hydrogen peroxide and non-peroxide based, were tested for their efficacy against four strains of P. aeruginosa and one strain of A. castellanii. Cells were inoculated into working concentrations of disinfecting solutions, incubated for 18 h and the numbers of viable bacteria or amoeba were analysed after appropriate growth on agar plates. Second, two strains of P. aeruginosa were allowed to interact with A. castellanii for 4 h prior to addition to disinfecting solutions. The numbers of P. aeruginosa after incubation with the disinfecting solutions were measured after growth on agar plates. RESULTS: In general, disinfecting solutions containing hydrogen peroxide were most effective against the micro-organisms. Solutions containing only traces of polyaminopropyl biguanide were least effective. CONCLUSIONS: For strains of P. aeruginosa, the presence of the amoebae did not protect the bacteria against the disinfecting agents. The amoeba appeared to kill the bacteria, perhaps using them as a food source.
