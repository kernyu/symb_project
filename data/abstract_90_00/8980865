There is growing concern, even among developed countries, about the increasing incidence of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). Results are reported from a study investigating ofloxacin used in the treatment of 57 patients with MDR-TB. Patients received ofloxacin 400 mg/day as well as three other sensitive anti-TB drugs based on susceptibility tests. Treatment duration was 9 months. Preliminary results of 35 evaluable patients show 55% of MDR-TB cases converted to smear and culture negative within 3 months of therapy. Ofloxacin in combination with other sensitive anti-TB medication shows promise in the treatment of MDR-TB and further studies are recommended.
