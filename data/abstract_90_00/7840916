AIM: To review evidence suggesting that antiretroviral therapy should be initiated at an early stage in HIV infection. METHOD: Review of published data. CONCLUSIONS: There are arguments both for and against early antiretroviral therapy. Although the reasons against are undoubtedly valid, evidence of greater efficacy, less toxicity and a delay in the development of resistance outweigh the possible disadvantages. Moreover, for some patients, early therapy may provide a chance of future benefits from more useful but currently untried treatments.
