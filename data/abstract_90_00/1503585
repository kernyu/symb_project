After almost forty years of its introduction, erythromycin will not be the exclusive member of the macrolide group of antibiotic agents, but a new generation of its derivatives which surpass it in pharmacological properties and clinical efficacy will also be available. Clarithromycin, a 14-membered derivative, has shown acid stability, longer half-life, lower protein binding and higher lung tissue penetration. Its exceedingly high activity against erythromycin-susceptible gram-positive cocci, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Legionella pneumophila makes it and important alternative choice in the therapy of respiratory tract infections. Also, it has shown high activity against Chlamydia trachomatis, and high urinary clearance of this unmetabolized molecule, important properties which would render it a special role in the treatment of genitourinary tract infections. Azithromycin, a 15-membered derivative has shown enhanced basicity (due to the nitrogen atom in its lactone ring), longer half-life and lower protein bindings. Its exceptional activity against Hemophilus influenzae, Branhamella catarrhalis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Ureaplasma urealyticum and gram-negative bacteria, and its high concentration in tonsillar, pulmonary, prostatic and female reproductive tract tissues, assigns it an honorific place among the macrolides in the therapy against respiratory tract and genitourinary tract infections. Its role against T. gondii deserves further study, but points out this agent as a promise against this parasite.
