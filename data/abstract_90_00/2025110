Tests for hemocultures were performed in 51 patients with clinical diagnoses of sepsis treated in a reanimation unit. Microbial cultures were isolated from 30 patients (58.9 per cent). Staphylococci in pure cultures and associations were the causative agents of sepsis in 26 patients (86.4 per cent). The cultures of E. coli, Y. enterocolitica and Streptococcus faecalis were isolated from 2, 1 and 1 patients, respectively. Pus specimens from 111 patients with postinjection suppuration were tested and staphylococci in pure cultures and associations were detected in 90 patients (81.8 per cent). The cultures of P. vulgaris, Streptococcus pyogenes, E. coli, Str. faecalis, Enterobacter spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were isolated from 10, 5, 3, 1, 1 and 1 patients, respectively. The results showed that Staphylococci played the leading role in development of the hospital infections. Treatment of such patients should be performed with an account of antibioticograms since many strains are resistant to various antibiotics.
