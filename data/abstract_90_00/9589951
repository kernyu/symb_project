Sensitivity was studied to fifteen antibiotics of different members of Staphylococcus aureus group of bacteria recovered from the mucous coats of the palatine tonsils, throat, in twenty seven patients with gastroduodenitis, 21 those with duodenal ulcer, 12 patients with other gastroenterological disorders, and 17 essentially healthy carriers of above micro-organisms. The pathogens causing tonsillopharyngitis in the patients appeared to be significantly less sensitive to seven antibiotics than they were in controls. Polyresistance to antibiotics is a sign of a higher virulence. It is conceivable that staphylococcus has a part in the pathogenesis of harmful changes in the tissues of the gastroduodenal zone.
