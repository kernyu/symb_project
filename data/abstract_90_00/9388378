A randomized prospective study was done to evaluate the two treatments for pressure sores infected with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in elderly patients: Gentian violet plus dibutyryl cAMP (GVcAMP, n = 8) and povidone-iodine plus sugar (IS, n = 11). Age, underlying diseases, and nutritional status did not differ between the two groups. Specimens were obtained biweekly from the pressure sores and were cultured. The percentage of culture dishes with no methicillin-resistant S. aureus was 93% for the patients given GVcAMP, but only 74% for those given IS (p < 0.01). By the 14th week after the start of treatment, the mean area of the pressure sores in the GVcAMP group had decreased to 45% of the area at the start of treatment. In the IS group, the decrease was smaller to 56% of the area before treatment. No local or systemic adverse effects occurred in either group. GVcAMP is useful to treat pressure sores infected with methicillin-resistant S. aureus.
