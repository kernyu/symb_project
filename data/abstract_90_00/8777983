We report the case of a 34 year old woman with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) sepsis with hyperimmunoglobulin E syndrome (HIES). Although chemotactic activity of neutrophils was impaired in this patient, neutrophils accumulated in the lungs as assessed by bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) counts. In addition to antibiotics and oxygen therapy, the administration of recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (rhG-CSF) resulted in a remarkable recovery.
