The preferred method for construction and in vivo expression of mutagenised Escherichia coli ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) is via high copy number plasmids. Transcription of wild-type rRNA from the seven chromosomal rrn operons in strains harbouring plasmid-coded mutant rRNAs leads to a heterogeneous ribosome population, which consequently hinders direct probing of mutant rRNAs. Here, we describe how nonconserved helical regions of plasmid-coded rRNA have been altered in a manner that preserves their secondary structures while creating new sites for primer extension of mutant rRNAs. This facilitates specific biochemical probing of mutagenised rRNA regions despite the background of wild-type molecules. Four priming sites have been made to investigate the structural effects of mutations in the GTPase centre, helix 1200-1250, the peptidyl transferase region and the alpha-sarcin loop of 23S rRNA.
