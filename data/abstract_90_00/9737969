The ability of the prodomains of trypanosomal cysteine proteinases to inhibit their active form was studied using a set of 23 overlapping 15-mer peptides covering the whole prosequence of congopain, the major cysteine proteinase of Trypanosoma congolense. Three consecutive peptides with a common 5-mer sequence YHNGA were competitive inhibitors of congopain. A shorter synthetic peptide consisting of this 5-mer sequence flanked by two Ala residues (AYHNGAA) also inhibited purified congopain. No residue critical for inhibition was identified in this sequence, but a significant improvement in Ki value was obtained upon N-terminal elongation. Procongopain-derived peptides did not inhibit lysosomal cathepsins B and L but did inhibit native cruzipain (from Dm28c clone epimastigotes), the major cysteine proteinase of Trypanosoma cruzi, the proregion of which also contains the sequence YHNGA. The positioning of the YHNGA inhibitory sequence within the prosegment of trypanosomal proteinases is similar to that covering the active site in the prosegment of cysteine proteinases, the three-dimensional structure of which has been resolved. This strongly suggests that trypanosomal proteinases, despite their long C-terminal extension, have a prosegment that folds similarly to that in related mammal and plant cysteine proteinases, resulting in reverse binding within the active site. Such reverse binding could also occur for short procongopain-derived inhibitory peptides, based on their resistance to proteolysis and their ability to retain inhibitory activity after prolonged incubation. In contrast, homologous peptides in related cysteine proteinases did not inhibit trypanosomal proteinases and were rapidly cleaved by these enzymes.
