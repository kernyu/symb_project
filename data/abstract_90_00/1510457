The stability of meropenem in the presence of renal dehydropeptidase I (DHP-I) varied extremely with the animal source of the enzyme. Meropenem, compared with imipenem, was rather easily hydrolyzed by DHP-Is from mice, rabbits, and monkeys, while it showed a higher resistance to guinea pig and beagle dog DHP-Is. In addition, meropenem was four times more resistant than imipenem to human DHP-I. The 1 beta-methyl substituent on carbapenems, i.e., meropenem and 1 beta-methyl imipenem, made them considerably more resistant to mouse and swine DHP-Is than the 1-unsubstituted derivatives are.
