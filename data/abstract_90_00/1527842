Acute cytopathic retroviral infections are accompanied by the accumulation, due to superinfection, of large amounts of unintegrated viral DNA in the cells. The cytopathic effects of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection are specific for cells that express the CD4 viral receptor and consist of syncytium formation and single-cell lysis. Here we investigated the relationship between superinfection and single-cell lysis by HIV-1. Antiviral agents were added to C8166 or Jurkat lymphocytes after HIV-1 infection had occurred. Treatment with azidothymidine or a neutralizing anti-gp120 monoclonal antibody reduced or eliminated, respectively, the formation of unintegrated viral DNA but did not inhibit single-cell killing. Furthermore, in the infected Jurkat cells, the levels of unintegrated viral DNA peaked several days before significant single-cell lysis was observed. Essentially complete superinfection resistance was established before the occurrence of single-cell killing. These results demonstrate that single-cell lysis by HIV-1 can be dissociated from superinfection and unintegrated viral DNA accumulation. These results also indicate that single-cell killing may involve envelope glycoprotein-receptor interactions not accessible to the exterior of the cell.
