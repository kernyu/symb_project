Tn5099, a promoter probe transposon for Streptomyces spp., was constructed by inserting a promoterless xylE gene and a hygromycin resistance gene into IS493. Tn5099 transposed into different sites in the Streptomyces griseofuscus genome, and the xylE reporter gene was expressed in some of the transposition mutants. Strains containing Tn5099 insertions that gave regulated expression of the xylE gene were identified.
