A collection of 45 strains of Pasteurella multocida was assembled. The strains had been isolated from cases of fowl cholera in eastern Australia over 8 years, and included mainly type A strains. All the strains were examined for plasmids and resistance to 10 antimicrobial agents and most of the strains were examined for restriction fragment length polymorphism. Nine strains were assayed for pathogenicity for mice. Twenty strains yielded no plasmid. Seven contained a single plasmid of 1.3 kbp and 18 contained 2 plasmids, of 2.4 and 7.5 kbp. All the strains were resistant to streptomycin, trimethoprim and lincomycin while one strain was resistant to tetracycline. There was no correlation between plasmid content and resistance to antimicrobial agents. Three strains that lacked plasmids were highly virulent for mice, 6 strains containing plasmids were not. Restriction fragment length polymorphism generated by HpaII allowed the 39 strains that were tested to be divided into 10 groups.
