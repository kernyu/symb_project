The surface margin of a restoration is where the restored tooth is subjected to aggressive oral attack. Any resistance to this attack will have favorable consequences on the clinical performance and longevity of the restoration. In this study, Black's class I classic cavity preparations were completed in 120 extracted intact human premolars that were restored with one of two silver amalgams, six different base conditions, and with or without cavity varnish, resulting in 20 different restoration combinations. The cavities were aged for 3 months and 1 year in 1% NaCl at 20 degrees C. A resin cast impression was made of the restoration margin for each specimen. Thereafter 80 restored teeth were subjected to an in vitro bacterial challenge for 36 days. The other 40 specimens were placed in an acidified (pH = 4.0) broth for the same length of time. A second cast impression was then made of the margin of each specimen. The casts were examined with a scanning electron microscope and the widest gap of the margin opening and the length of margin showing a discrepancy were measured. Specimens were ranked first on the basis of the gap size and then on percent of margin discrepancy length. Results were evaluated with one-way ANOVA and Turkey's Student range test with a critical level of statistical significance (p < 0.05). Base type significantly affected aged margin quality. Cariogenic challenge caused a significant breakdown of the amalgam margin although the type of challenge was not significant. A shorter aging time, varnish, and high copper amalgam exacerbated the breakdown. Margin breakdown can be reduced by judicious selection of restoration material combinations.
