The acquisition of antibiotic-resistance genes by virtually all major bacterial pathogens is currently a world-wide phenomenon. This problem is especially evident in nosocomial lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI). Carbapenems like imipenem and meropenem offer interesting antibacterial activities and beta-lactamase-stability, as well as adequate pharmacokinetic characteristics, to cover most of the pathogens involved in moderate to severe community-acquired and nosocomial LRTI. In contrast to imipenem, meropenem is not nephrotoxic and offers the advantage of greater stability against renal dehydropeptidase-I, so no concomitant application of an enzyme inhibitor is necessary. Meropenem can also be given by intravenous infusion or injection without the nausea and vomiting often associated with the administration of imipenem/cilastatin. Preliminary results with meropenem in LRTI show excellent cure rates and good tolerance for this new carbapenem.
