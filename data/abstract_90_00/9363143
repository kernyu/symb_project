Pneumonia remains a serious illness with significant associated morbidity and mortality. Parallelling our increased understanding of the etiology, epidemiology, and pathogenesis of pneumonia and the development of new antibiotics has been the frightening increase in the rate and extent of bacterial resistance. The prevalence of resistance has reached unprecedented levels in many countries, and we are facing the specter of infection by pathogens for which we have no effective treatment. To better understand some of the newer developments in this field, the discussion centers around the interactive triad of the host, pathogen, and drug. Pertinent developments relevant to each of these three areas are considered, along with a discussion of their clinical impact.
