We have investigated the effect of genetic alterations in the rpsL gene on the MICs of streptomycin for Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains. Direct DNA sequencing showed a point mutation in 23/121 strains; in 18 strains the mutation was associated with an amino acid change. The MICs of streptomycin in 22 out of 23 point-mutated strains were > or = 256 mg/L. Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis showed mutations at codon 43 in all 18 strains with point mutations in the same codon. Our results suggest that both RFLP and base sequencing analysis of the rpsL gene are useful for the rapid prediction of highly streptomycin-resistant strains of M. tuberculosis.
