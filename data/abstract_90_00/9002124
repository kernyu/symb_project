BACKGROUND: The use of fluorinated quinolone antibiotics to selectively decontaminate the gastrointestinal tract is a reasonable alternative to prevent infection in neutropenic patients. The fluoroquinolones represent ideal antibiotics with which to achieve the principles of selective decontamination by allowing colonization of anaerobes to inhibit the adherence, colonization and proliferation of potentially pathogenic aerobic flora. OBJECTIVE: This report describes the prophylactic use of fluoroquinolones in neutropenic patients. RESULTS: The majority of studies of fluoroquinolone prophylaxis in neutropenic patients have shown a reduction in documented Gram-negative bacterial infections. However, Gram-positive infections, particularly those with viridans streptococci, present a major impediment to the use of single agent prophylaxis with a quinolone. CONCLUSION: Prophylaxis with fluoroquinolones in neutropenic patients was found to be advantageous, but it must be balanced against the risk of Gram-positive infections and the potential for antibiotic resistance.
