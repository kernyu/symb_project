An apoptosis-resistant mutant (VC-33) was selected from HL-60 by alternating exposure to camptothecin and etoposide. VC-33 cells demonstrated resistance to apoptosis as induced not only by camptothecin and etoposide but by a variety of other agents as well, including 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine, hydroxyurea, calcium ionophore (A23187), cycloheximide, and UV irradiation. In an effort to identify the mechanism of such apoptosis resistance, a mRNA differential display analysis was used. Among a total of 12 bands with reduced expression in VC-33 cells, 1 cDNA clone was isolated that was hybridized to the wild-type transcript but not to the VC-33 transcript on Northern blotting. Partial sequence of this gene revealed 98% homology to mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase subunit 5. When cell growth and intracellular ATP levels under glucose starvation were measured, VC-33 cells were found to be more sensitive than wild-type cells. Thus, NADH dehydrogenase deficiency may contribute, at least in part, to the mechanism of resistance to apoptosis in VC-33 cells.
