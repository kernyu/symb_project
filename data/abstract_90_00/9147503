BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial resistance of enterococci isolated from blood samples in three hospitals in Madrid (Spain) from 1994 to 1995. METHODS: One hundred strains, 83 Enterococcus faecalis, 15 E. faecium, and 2 E. durans, isolated from January 1994 to April 1995 were studied. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of 11 antimicrobians were determined by the agar dilution method. RESULTS: Four percent of the strains were resistant to ampicillin and 7% to penicillin. Ninety-two percent were sensitive to vancomycin. The percentage of strains with a high level of resistance (HLR) to some aminoglucoside was 60%. HLR was observed to gentamycin in 41%, to streptomycin in 46% and to kanamycin in 58% of the strains. Half of the isolates were resistant to the fluoroquinolones tested. HLR was significantly associated with aminoglucosides with HLR (MIC > or = 16 mg/l) to fluoroquinolones in the strains studied (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of resistance to ampicillin and vancomycin is low and very high to aminoglucosides and fluoroquinolones. There is also a very significant association between HLR to fluoroquinolones and HLR to aminoglucosides.
