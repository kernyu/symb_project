Statistical analyses were conducted on bacterial strains isolated from the urine of patients with urinary tract infections (UTI) in the Department of Urology at Aichi Medical University from January 1988 through December 1991. The drug sensitivity of the bacterial strains isolated from patients with complicated UTI between 1988 and 1991 was analyzed and compared. Among the outpatients with uncomplicated UTI, a total of 352 strains were isolated. E. coli was isolated the most frequently (90.1%). Among the outpatients with complicated UTI, a total of 829 strains were isolated. Enterococcus sp. was isolated the most frequently (21.2%). P. aeruginosa and S. aureus showed a tendency to increase. Among the inpatients with complicated UTI, a total of 671 strains were isolated. Enterococcus sp. was isolated the most frequently (22.5%). P. aeruginosa and S. aureus showed a tendency to increase, while E. coli and Enterobacter sp. showed a tendency to decrease. E. coli was highly sensitive to all drugs except ampicillin (ABPC). Proteus sp. and Klebsiella sp. were highly sensitive to norfloxacin (NFLX). P. aeruginosa was highly sensitive to gentamicin (GM). The frequency of NFLX-sensitive P. aeruginosa significantly dropped from 84.6% to 40.9% among the outpatients (P < 0.01), and from 75.0% to 44.4% among inpatients (P < 0.05). S. aureus was highly sensitive only to minocycline (MINO). The frequency of NFLX-sensitive S. aureus significantly dropped from 66.6% to 23.3% among inpatients (P < 0.05). Enterococcus sp. was highly sensitive to ABPC and MINO. Of the new quinolones, tosufloxacin (TFLX) had the strongest antimicrobial activity followed by (ciprofloxacin) CPFX on all the bacterial strains tested.
