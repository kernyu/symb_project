Treatment of childhood pneumonia in developing countries requires knowledge of susceptibility patterns for Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. Between October 1991 and April 1993, a surveillance survey of antimicrobial resistance was performed at two fever hospitals in Egypt; nasopharyngeal swab and blood specimens obtained from 1,635 children with pneumonia were cultured for these organisms. Susceptibility testing of these organisms was performed. At least one of these organisms was isolated from nasopharyngeal swab specimens from 73% of the children; 3.7% of blood cultures were positive. For S. pneumoniae strains, 70.9% of nasopharyngeal isolates were calculated to be susceptible to penicillin vs. 77.6% of blood isolates; the percentages of isolates susceptible to co-trimoxazole were 73.0% and 75.0%, respectively. For H. influenzae strains, 93.0% of nasopharyngeal isolates were calculated to be susceptible to ampicillin vs. 100% of blood isolates; the percentages of isolates susceptible to co-trimoxazole were 84.9% and 100%, respectively. Although most S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae strains associated with childhood pneumonia in Cairo were susceptible to penicillins and co-trimoxazole, antimicrobial resistance did not occur.
