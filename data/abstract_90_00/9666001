Mannitol salt agar was evaluated for detection of oxacillin resistance in 136 Staphylococcus aureus isolates. All mecA-positive isolates (n = 54) were correctly categorized as oxacillin resistant by the disk diffusion test (1-microgram disk; zone diameter, < 16 mm); the specificity was 97.6%. Agar screening (2 micrograms of oxacillin per ml) revealed a sensitivity of 98.1% and a specificity of 95.1%.
