We searched for a functional marker with which T cells mediating acquired cellular resistance (ACR) can be discriminated from those mediating delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) in mice immunized with Mycobacterium bovis BCG. Four wk after injection of the mice with 10(5) viable BCG (vBCG) cells emulsified in IFA, a passive transfer experiment revealed that T cells mediating DTH as well as ACR, which we designated TACR, were generated in the spleen. In contrast, T cells mediating only DTH (TDTH) were generated by immunization with 10(7) killed BCG cells along with IFA. The transferring ability of both TACR and TDTH was substantially reduced by treatment with anti-Thy-1.2 or anti-CD4 mAb plus complement, whereas anti-CD8 treatment had no effect. To determine the functional differences between TACR and TDTH, we assessed IL-2 and IFN-gamma production from TACR and TDTH after stimulation with PPD in vitro. Similar levels of enhanced IL-2 activity were detected in the culture supernatants of both groups of T cells. However, augmented production of IFN-gamma was observed only in TACR. This finding was confirmed by Northern blot analysis for detection of IFN-gamma-specific mRNA. In addition, a significant increase in the number of IFN-gamma-producing cells was observed only in T cells from mice immunized with vBCG. The production of IFN-gamma was also totally abolished by treatment with anti-Thy-1.2 and anti-CD4 mAb plus complement in vitro, whereas anti-CD8 mAb treatment had no effect. These results suggest that CD4+ protective T cells generated by immunization with vBCG are characterized by the ability to produce IFN-gamma after stimulation with specific Ag.
