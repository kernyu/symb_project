There is no uniformly accepted method for detecting colonization with vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). The sensitivities of five culture methods were determined for patients known to harbor VRE. Of 189 inpatients, 101 were found to harbor VRE by at least one method. Three methods detected fewer than half of the cultures. Campylobacter agar identified 70% of patients. Enterococcosel broth (containing vancomycin and aztreonam) identified 88% and may be preferred over other media for routine surveillance.
