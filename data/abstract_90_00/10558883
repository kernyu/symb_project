Overexpression of heat-shock (HS) proteins (HSP) is often sufficient to protect against lethal environmental stresses. Anti-inflammatory salicylates potentiate the induction of the 70 kDa HSP (Hsp70) in mammals in response to HS and enhance thermotolerance. In plants, salicylic acid (SA) is a natural signalling molecule, mediating resistance in response to avirulent pathogens. The influence of SA on the HS response in plants is, however, unknown. We investigated the effect of SA, alone or with HS, on Hsp70/Hsc70 expression in tomato cells using biometabolic labelling and Western blotting. A dose- and time-dependent influence on Hsp70/Hsc70 accumulation was observed: SA at 1.0 mM (3 h) potentiated heat-induced accumulation, while 1.0 mM (5 h) and 0.5 mM (8 h) induced expression, the latter preceded by increased membrane permeability. These results suggest that in plants, as in mammals, low SA concentrations do not induce Hsp70/Hsc70 expression but potentiate HS induction and confer membrane protection, while cytotoxic levels induce Hsp70/Hsc70.
