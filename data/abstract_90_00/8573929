OBJECTIVE: We tested whether healing and regression could be promoted by granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and interferon in a 6-month-old girl with an ulcerated haemangioma resistant to systemic steroid therapy. METHODS: Interferon alfa-2b (Introna, Schering-Plough) was given subcutaneously once daily at a dose of 3 million units/m2 for 5.5 months and rhGM-CSF (Molgramostim, Leucomax; Sandoz/Schering-Plough) 3.33 units was applied on the wound surfaces once and concomitantly with the initiation of interferon therapy. RESULTS: The ulcer healed completely within 1 month and the haemangioma almost totally regressed within 6 months. CONCLUSION: Local application of rhGM-CSF appears to be effective in promoting ulcer healing in an ulcerated haemangioma otherwise responding to interferon treatment.
