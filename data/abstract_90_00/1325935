Seven clinical isolates of lactobacilli were found to be relatively hydrophobic with a mean water-contact angle of 66 +/- 15 degrees, and to be susceptible to 1% nonoxynol-9 and vancomycin. However, seven other strains were relatively hydrophilic with a mean water-contact angle of 32 +/- 13 degrees, and found to be resistant to 25% nonoxynol-9 and vancomycin. Thus, the surface properties of lactobacilli that influence susceptibility to antimicrobial agents may involve surface hydrophobicity. Possibly the penetration barrier posed by the cell surface towards these two nonionic antimicrobials is lower for hydrophobic cells than for hydrophilic cells.
