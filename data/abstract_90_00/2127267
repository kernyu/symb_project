The in-vitro activity of cefpodoxime, the active compound of the ester prodrug, cefpodoxime proxetil, was compared with that of other antibiotics. The susceptibility of bacterial isolates from patients with respiratory tract infections was determined by an agar dilution method. The MIC90s of cefpodozime for ampicillin-sensitive and beta-lactamase-producing strains of Haemophilus influenzae were 0.12 and 0.25 mg/l, respectively; the MIC90s for ampicillin-resistant non-beta-lactamase-producing strains was 1 mg/l. Time-kill curves of cefpodoxime against ampicillin-sensitive and ampicillin-resistant beta-lactamase producing strains showed a time-dependent bactericidal activity. The MIC90s for ampicillin-sensitive and ampicillin-resistant Branhamella catarrhalis were 0.50 and 1 mg/l, respectively. The MIC90s for penicillin-sensitive pneumococci, beta-haemolytic streptococci and Streptococcus agalactiae were 0.06, 0.06 and 0.12 mg/l, respectively. The inhibitory activity against penicillin-resistant pneumococci was limited: the MIC90 was 4 mg/l.
