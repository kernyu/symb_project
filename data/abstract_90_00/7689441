Acute bacterial diarrhoea is still an important disease, especially in developing countries. Resistance to antibiotics among enteric pathogens is relatively common in many parts of the world. The quinolones are active in vitro against these organisms, and achieve high stool concentrations. Because of these features, quinolones have been used in the treatment of acute diarrhoeal diseases caused by various bacteria. They appear to be effective in the therapy of shigellosis and travellers' diarrhoea, as well as in the prevention of diarrhoeal disease in travellers. However, their role in the treatment of salmonella gastroenteritis has not been established yet.
