Purulent wounds in 88 victims of the Armenian earthquake with the syndrome of long-term squeezing were examined microbiologically and the experience with using antimicrobial drugs for their treatment was analyzed. In all the cases microbial associations were detected, coliform and nonfermenting gram-negative bacilli, enterococci, anaerobes and yeast-like fungi being isolated from 80, 20, 15 and 25 per cent of the patients respectively. 130 bacterial strains were studied in detail. 80 to 100 per cent of the bacterial isolates were resistant to the antibiotics routinely used in surgical practice, i.e. benzylpenicillin, tetracycline, levomycetin, kanamycin, cephalothin and cefazolin and highly sensitive to new antimicrobial drugs belonging to ureidopenicillins (mezlocillin), quinolones (ciprofloxacin) and cephalosporins of the 3rd generation (cefoperazone and ceftazidime). Retrospective estimation of the antibiotic therapy revealed its inadequacy in 55.7 per cent of the patients for the most part because of the isolates resistance. The 19 variants of the antibiotic use prescribed by the physicians mainly included penicillins, aminoglycosides and their combinations (in 67.2 per cent of the cases). The use of the highly efficient drugs of the groups of ureidopenicillins and quinolones was extremely rare which was likely due to lacking of information on the drugs.
