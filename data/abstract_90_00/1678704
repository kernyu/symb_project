Nine methicillin-sensitive (MSSA) and 37 methicillin-resistant (MRSA) Staphylococcus aureus isolates of various phage types and resistotypes from seven countries were investigated. Chromosomal DNA was restricted with HindIII or EcoRI, Southern blotted and hybridised with a cDNA probe to 16S+23S rRNA derived from MRSA NCTC 10442. Resulting rDNA profiles could be differentiated on the basis of 22 patterns which were unaffected by changes in plasmid, transposon, enterotoxin A or phage content. Percentage similarity values were calculated using the Dice coefficient and UPGA clustering. Australian and epidemic (EMRSA-1) isolates from the UK showed a high degree of similarity, but the pattern was not unique and was also found in MSSA and other MRSA, e.g. NCTC 10442. An MSSA of phage group II was the most distinct isolate. The method shows potential as an additional tool in a complex typing system, types non-phage typable strains and may provide clues to the clonal evolution of MRSA and MSSA.
