This paper describes the frequency of susceptibility of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria against antibacterial agents. The data are based on all susceptibility tests performed in 1996 at the Department of Medical Microbiology of the University of Zurich and at the private medical laboratory "medica" in Zurich. The evaluation of the results from 1975 to 1996 shows that susceptibilities against the antimicrobial agents tested have not changed markedly in this period with few exceptions. The tables may be a help for the physician in his decision for a "calculated chemotherapy" of bacterial infections.
