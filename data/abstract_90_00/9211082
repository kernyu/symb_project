Nelfinavir is a protease inhibitor which shows good inhibitory activity against HIV-1. The pattern of HIV-1 resistance to nelfinavir is different from that seen with other protease inhibitors. In healthy male volunteers, administration of single 400 and 800mg doses of nelfinavir with food resulted in area under the plasma concentration-time curve values that were 27 to 50% higher than those achieved in fasted volunteers who received the same doses of the drug. Reductions in plasma HIV RNA to below detectable levels (detection limit 500 copies/ml) were achieved in some patients (number not reported) after 28 days' treatment with nelfinavir 500, 600 or 750 mg twice daily, or 500, 750 or 1000 mg 3 times daily. Combination therapy with nelfinavir and stavudine produced greater reductions in plasma HIV RNA levels that stavudine monotherapy in patients who had not previously received stavudine treatment; mean increases in CD4+ cell counts were also greater in the combination treatment group than in monotherapy recipients. Plasma HIV RNA decreased to below detectable levels in 11 of 12 patients with early onset HIV infection who received a triple regimen of nelfinavir, zidovudine and lamivudine for 16 weeks.
