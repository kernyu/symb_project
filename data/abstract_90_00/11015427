Recent reports on some methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) with reduced susceptibility to vancomycin have been a major concern in Korea because of the widespread use of vancomycin due to a high prevalence of MRSA in the country. We describe a 45-year-old man with long-standing pelvic abscess due to MRSA. In spite of vancomycin and teicoplanin treatment for a long period of time, the patient died from MRSA sepsis. The blood culture isolate of MRSA exhibited reduced susceptibility to vancomycin (MIC, 8 microg/ml). This is the first report of a vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus case from Korea.
