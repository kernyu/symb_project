OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the development of resistance to fosfomycin or fucidic acid in severe infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and to assess the relationship with serum levels of vancomycin METHODS: A retrospective study was performed in patients hospitalized in our intensive care unit during a 3-year period (1993-1995) who were treated for severe MRSA infection with continuous infusion vacomycin and fosfomycin or fucidic acid. We analyzed the development of resistance and serum levels of vancomycin. RESULTS: During this period, only 20 patients received continuous infusion vancomycin plus fucidic acid or fosfomycin. MSRA resistant to fucidic or fosfomycin developed in 9. Vancomycin serum levels were significantly lower in patients who developed resistance to focidic acid or fosfomycin, both during the first 5 days of treatment (16.68 +/- 1.07 micrograms/ml vs. 22.64 +/- 1.05 mg/ml, p < 0.01) and throughout treatment duration (17.29 +/- 1.07 micrograms/ml vs. 21.85 +/- 0.78 microgram/ml, p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings confirm that in spite of continuous vancomycin infusion at an initial rate of 2 g/24 h, Staphylococcus aureus resistance to fosfomycin or fucidic acid an develop during ongoing treatment. Vancomycin levels of at least 20 micrograms/ml should be obtained as rapidly as possible.
