Tumor cell lines are generally killed by lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells. In this study, however, we report a LAK-resistant cell line, OKM-2T. The OKM-2T is an adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) cell line, and was compared to other ATL cell lines and non-ATL cell lines. The LAK cells were generated from healthy volunteers. Cell surface markers were determined by a flow cytometry test. The ATL and non-ATL cell lines were killed by the LAK cells, markedly or moderately. However, the OKM-2T was scarcely killed. The adhesion tendency of the OKM-2T to the LAK cells was preserved at the same level as that of the other cell lines, whereas the OKM-2T showed low levels of adhesion molecules CD58 (LFA-3), CD86, and CD106 (VCAM-1). We determined blocking tests using specific antibodies. Anti-CD58 blocked the LAK lysis. Anti-CD54 and anti-CD106 enhanced the blocking effect of the anti-CD58; anti-CD86 did not show such an effect. These results suggest that the low expression of CD58 in the OKM-2T may have an intimate relationship with LAK resistance, and that the low expression of CD106 may also be responsible for it, in part.
