In this report, three DNA repair-deficient mutants of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (uvs13, uvs14, uvs15) were characterized by using genetic, mutational and biochemical analyses. The mutant strain uvs15 belongs to the most sensitive repair-deficient mutants following exposure to all agents used. It is deficient in the nuclear excision-repair pathway, whereas uvs13 and uvs14 are not blocked in removal of pyrimidine dimers. Mutation study also revealed differences among strains. The mutant uvs15 does not mutate after UV and X-ray irradiation, and there is very low mutation rate after MNNG. These findings might indicate the involvement of UVS15 gene product in regulation of several repair pathways. Contrary to this, uvs14 showed higher mutation frequency, both spontaneous and induced after UV and MNNG treatments. Tetrad dissection proved that the uvs13 and uvs14 genes are located on the right arm of the linkage group I in the vicinity of the previously mapped uvs10 gene. Both mutants belong to the same repair pathway, which is different from that of uvs10 and uvs15.
