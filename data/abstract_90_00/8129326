Contaminating microbial flora and their in vitro antibiotic sensitivity pattern was determined for 1557 eyes from donor cadavers collected during five years. Positive cultures were obtained in 42.77% of the eyes; bacterial growth was observed in 39.17% of the eyes and fungal growth, in 3.6%. There was significant variation in the rate of contamination from year to year during the study period. Staphylococcus albus was the most frequently isolated organism (28.10%), followed by Acinetobacter spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Alcaligenes faecalis, respectively. Most of the organisms were resistant to commonly used antibiotics with a low weighted index of effectiveness, particularly toward gentamicin (resistance, 50.82%). The findings were compared with previous data from the same eye bank, and the variations are discussed.
