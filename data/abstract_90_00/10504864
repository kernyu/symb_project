Bacteria associated with wound infection in Ekpoma, Nigeria, and their antimicrobial susceptibility profile was investigated by standard microbiological methods, using hospital as well as non-hospital patients. Of 40 patients seen, 25 (62.5%) were males, while the rest were females. Those aged 30 years and above accounted for 63% of the patients, and post-operative sepsis was the most frequently encountered wound infection. Of the organisms encountered, Staphylococcus aureus was the most frequently occurring organism (39%), followed by coliform bacilli (24%), which was the most prevalent organism (44%) in post-operative sepsis. Twenty-one percent of the isolates were Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The majority of the bacterial isolates from the infected wounds were susceptible to Gentamicin, as follows: 92% of the Staph. aureus, 100% of Streptococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli and Pseud. aeruginosa, and 75% of the coliform bacilli. It is suggested that gentamicin, in combination with metronidazole, be used not only for empirical treatment of wound infections in Ekpoma locality but also for prophylactic coverage of surgical operations.
