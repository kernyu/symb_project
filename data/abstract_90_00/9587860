BACKGROUND AND AIMS OF THE STUDY: Glutaraldehyde cross-linked bovine pericardium was post-treated with homocysteic acid in order to bond unreacted glutaraldehyde groups, and preserved in aldehyde-free solution to reduce the toxicity and calcification potential of the tanned tissue. The study aim was to verify the efficacy and preservation of chemical and mechanical properties of pericardial tissue treated in this way. METHODS: Detoxification efficacy was tested by measuring free aldehyde groups and by in vitro cultivation of human endothelial cells on pericardial samples. Material stability tests included mechanical characterization, shrink temperature measurement, pronase digestion resistance and amino acid analysis after acid hydrolysis. The effect of treatment on fatigue resistance was evaluated by monitoring changes in permeability and compliance caused by 15 x 10(6) cycles of pulsatile stress. RESULTS: Detoxified samples showed negligible glutaraldehyde residues and significantly improved endothelial cell proliferation compared with conventionally treated samples. Chemical and mechanical properties were similar in detoxified and glutaraldehyde-treated samples. Tissue fatigue behavior was not modified by homocysteic acid treatment. CONCLUSION: Homocysteic acid treatment effectively reduces toxicity but does not affect the stability of glutaraldehyde cross-linked pericardium.
