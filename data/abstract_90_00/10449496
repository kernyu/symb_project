The rpoB gene mutations in a 69-bp region of the gene, resulting in resistance to rifampin, were used to discriminate between Mycobacterium tuberculosis IS6110 fingerprint subclusters. These subclusters exhibited identical IS6110 fragments or had one or two additional fragments. In the two major subclusters all the analyzed strains have the same variant rpoB allele but are different from each other, suggesting the occurrence of independent outbreaks.
