BACKGROUND: The development of new antimicrobials is driven by the emergence of resistant bacteria, a change in disease pattern such as that caused by opportunistic and nosocomial infections and a need for improved pharmacokinetics or reduced adverse reactions. OBJECTIVE: This article looks at the emerging resistances of significance in the 1990s and then at the new antibiotics that are either to be released or are under development. DISCUSSION: Although some of these antibiotics show great promise, their long term value will ultimately be determined by how appropriately they are used by the medical community.
