Rationally designed combinations of rifampicin/thiacetazone plus isoniazid and/or ethambutol are highly effective in the treatment of patients (including HIV-pos.) infected with multiply resistant mycobacteria of the M. avium complex (MAC). Clinical results are very promising. The high efficacy of these combinations is due to the synergistic potentiation of single drug activities. As soon as rifabutin is marketed it should replace rifampicin in the combination treatment of patients with highly rifampicin-resistant MAC bacteria.
