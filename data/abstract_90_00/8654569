Kluyveromyces lactis mutants defective in the glycolytic enzyme phosphoglucose isomerase are able to grow in glucose media and to produce ethanol, but they depend on a functional respiratory chain and do not grow in glucose-antimycin media. We postulate that this is due to the necessity of reoxidizing, in the mitochondria, the NADPH produced by the pentose phosphate pathway, which may be highly active in these mutants in order to bypass the blockade in the phosphoglucose isomerase step. This oxidation would be mediated by a cytoplasmic-side mitochondrial NAD(P)H dehydrogenase that would pass the electrons to ubiquinone. Data supporting this hypothesis are provided.
