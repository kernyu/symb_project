Overexpression of major outer membrane protein OprH of Pseudomonas aeruginosa as a result of mutation (in strain H181) or adaptation to low Mg2+ concentrations (in parent strain H103) is accompanied by increased resistance to polymyxin B, gentamicin, and EDTA. A 2.8-kb EcoRI fragment containing the oprH gene was subcloned into several different expression plasmids in Escherichia coli. These experiments showed that significant levels of OprH could be produced from a promoter on the EcoRI fragment; that the cloned oprH gene was not regulated by Mg2+ deficiency; that there were no differences in the expression of OprH in any construction, regardless of whether the gene from strain H103 or its OprH-overexpressing, polymyxin B-resistant derivative, strain H181, was used; and that overexpression of OprH in E. coli to the level observed in P. aeruginosa H181 did not result in a resistance phenotype. These results favored the conclusion that the mutation in strain H181 was a regulatory rather than a promoter mutation. The oprH gene was cloned behind the benzoate-inducible pm promoter in plasmid pGB25 and transferred to P. aeruginosa H103. Overexpression of OprH from the cloned gene in H103/pGB25 resulted in EDTA resistance but not polymyxin B resistance. This result suggested that another factor, possibly lipopolysaccharide, was affected by the mutation in strain H181. Consistent with this suggestion was the demonstration that mutants of strain H181 with alterations in lipopolysaccharide had reverted to wild-type polymyxin B susceptibility but had unaltered gentamicin and EDTA resistance. These data were consistent with the hypothesis that OprH replaces outer membrane-stabilizing divalent cations.
