Children with Plasmodium falciparum infections in Western Province, Kenya, were studied in 1987 for their parasitological, clinical and haematological response to chloroquine, to amodiaquine and to pyrimethamine-sulfadoxine plus quinine. Ninety-eight children under 5 years of age were treated in 1 of 2 hospitals. Of the 56 patients treated with chloroquine base 25 mg/kg, 91% had resistant infections, with 36% having no significant decrease in parasitaemia (RIII resistance); however, 69% responded clinically within a week. Of the 27 patients treated with amodiaquine base 25 mg/kg, 67% had resistant infections, with 7% RIII resistant; 81% responded clinically. The parasites cleared in all 15 children given pyrimethamine-sulfadoxine plus 3 days of quinine. Only when parasites cleared did patients have improved haemoglobins and haematocrits. This study shows that parasitaemia in children hospitalized in western Kenya responds poorly to 4-aminoquinolines, although the patients improve clinically, at least during the first 7 days. Young children may need to clear parasites to avoid the risk of severe anemia and the need for blood transfusions.
