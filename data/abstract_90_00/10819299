Preparations of antimicrobials from biotechnological sources containing nucleic acids may serve as vector for the dissemination of resistance genes. An essential prerequisite for the acquisition of a new resistance phenotype in a transformational scenario is the availability of physically intact DNA molecules capable of transforming competent microorganisms. DNA is thought to be an easy target for catabolic processes when present in the natural habitat of bacteria (e.g. gastrointestinal tract, soil) due to the overall presence of nucleolytic enzymes. Aminoglycoside antibiotics are known to display a strong affinity to nucleic acids rendering these compounds to be primary candidates for exerting DNA protective functions in the gastrointestinal tract when applied orally during antibiotic chemotherapy. Using a DNase I protection assay it could be demonstrated that neomycin B at a concentration of 2 mM completely inhibited degradation of plasmid DNA in vitro. No inhibition of degradation was observed with streptomycin and kanamycin and the non-aminoglycoside antibiotics oxytetracycline and ampicillin under identical assay conditions. Thus, neomycin preparations may be able to promote structural integrity of contaminating DNA-fragments in DNase-rich environments.
