Malaria constitutes one of the major health threats in the tropical and sub-tropical areas of the world. Yet, few advances were made in recent years in revealing the mode of action of the common and most economically affordable antimalarial drugs, the schizontocidal 4-aminoquinolines. Data presented indubitably repudiate the previous notions that these drugs act by either halting the feeding of the parasite on its host erythrocyte cytosol or repressing nucleic acid synthesis due to intercalation into the parasite's DNA. A novel target for drugs is outlined, i.e. they are shown to inhibit in vitro the release of iron from acidified host cell cytosol, consisting mostly of hemoglobin, a process that could provide this trace element to the parasite. Resistance to quinoline-containing drugs is the principal reason for the present resurgence of malaria. Drug-resistant parasites accumulate less of these weak base-like drugs in the acidic digestive vacuoles. A kinetic model is presented, indicating that diminishing drug accumulation is due to decreased vacuolar proton pump activity and is not a result of a putative multidrug resistance (MDR) efflux pump. Findings to date on the molecular biology of parasite mdr genes are reviewed. These indicate no correlation between gene expression or mutations and phenotypic drug resistance. Reversal of parasite drug resistance by relevant compounds in MDR cancer cells seems to involve mechanism(s) different from the inhibition of the MDR pump in cancer cells.
