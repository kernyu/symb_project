Inducible chloramphenicol resistance genes cat and cmlA are regulated by translation attenuation. For both genes, the leader codons that must be translated to deliver a ribosome to the induction site specify a peptide that inhibits peptidyltransferase in vitro. The antipeptidyltransferase activity of the peptides is thought to select the site of ribosome stalling that is essential for induction. Using variations of the cat-86 leader-encoded 5-mer peptide MVKTD, we demonstrate a correlation between the in vitro antipeptidyltransferase activity and the ability of the same peptide to support induction by chloramphenicol in vivo. MVKTD footprints to nucleotides 2058, 2059, and 2060 in 23S rRNA. In vivo methylation of nucleotide 2058 by the ermC methylase interferes neither with cat-86 induction nor with peptide inhibition of peptidyltransferase. The methylation eliminates the competition that normally occurs in vitro between erythromycin and MVKTD. MVKTD inhibits the peptidyltransferase of several eubacteria, a representative Archaea species, and the eukaryote Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Bacillus stearothermophilus supports the in vivo induction of cat-86, and the RNA that is phenol extracted from the 50S ribosomes of this gram-positive thermophile is catalytically active in the peptidyltransferase assay and sensitive to peptide inhibition. Our results indicate that peptidyltransferase inhibition by a cat leader peptide is essential to induction, and this activity can be altered by minor changes in the amino acid sequence of the peptide. The broad range of organisms shown to possess peptide-inhibitable peptidyltransferase suggests that the target is a highly conserved component of the ribosome and includes 23S rRNA.
