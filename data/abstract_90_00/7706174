The isolation rate of penicillin resistant pneumococci is increasing in France. To date, cefotaxime and ceftriaxone are the two drugs recommended for the treatment of severe infections and oral third generation cephalosporins are frequently employed for the treatment of non-invasive pneumococcal diseases. In this study, we determined the bacteriostatic activity of 21 antibiotic combinations against 13 clinical isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae with MICs > or = 0.1 mg/L penicillin and 13 strains that were susceptible.
