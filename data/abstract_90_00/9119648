The acute effects of intravenous (i.v.) cyclosporine A (CsA) on blood pressure and other haemodynamic parameters were examined in 8 patients with end-stage renal disease on haemodialysis (HD). The study was performed after the mid-week haemodialysis session, when the patients were on their dry body weight. Each patient received an i.v. infusion of 5 mg/kg of CsA in 120 ml of 5% dextrose in water during 2 hours. Heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP, DBP) were monitored by the Holter system. An echocardiogram (M-mode 2-dimensional and Doppler sonography) was performed using an automatic device (Ultramark 6) before CsA administration, at 30, 60 and 120 minutes during CsA infusion, and at 30 minutes thereafter. SBP, DBP and calculated peripheral vascular resistance (CPVR) increased significantly in respect to basal values at 120 and 150 minutes (SBP: basal 130 +/- 21, 120 min: 136 +/- 20, 150 min: 140 +/- 18, p < 0.05 and p < 0.01, respectively. DBP: basal 80 +/- 9, 120 min: 86 +/- 13, 150 min: 88 +/- 13, p < 0.05 and p < 0.01, respectively. CPVR: basal 1000 +/- 228, 120 min: 1178 +/- 305, 150 min: 1236 +/- 270 dyne/s/cm5, p < 0.01). However, systolic volume (SV) and cardiac output (CO) showed significant decreases from the basal values (SV: basal 103 +/- 29, 120 min: 85 +/- 22, 150 min: 85 +/- 17, p < 0.05. CO: basal 8.2 +/- 2, 120 min: 7.3 +/- 1.1, 150 min: 7 +/- 1.2 l/min, p < 0.05). In conclusion, CsA infusion produces a significant elevation of blood pressure, which seems to be mediated by a direct action on peripheral vascular resistance.
