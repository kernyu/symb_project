A background level of sister-chromatid exchange (SCE) is found in mammalian cells. However, in the somatic cells of Drosophila melanogaster, there was no spontaneous SCE if a minimum concentration of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) was used. In this communication we report that in a mosquito (Aedes albopictus) cell line (C6/36), some cells also have no background SCE (0-SCE). Subclones of high (44%) or low (12%) frequency of 0-SCE cells were obtained, but none of them contained 100% 0-SCE cells. Increasing frequency of SCE/cell concomitant with decreasing frequency of 0-SCE cells was observed by raising the BrdU concentration in the culture medium during the first cell cycle, culturing cells at lower density and depleting reduced glutathione (GSH) with buthionine sulfoximine. Since these mosquito cells contain much higher level of GSH than Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, and feeding cells with BrdU increased GSH in mosquito cells but decreased GSH in CHO cells, we speculate that GSH may play a role in the low or non-existent background SCE and in the high resistance to many DNA damaging agents of mosquito cells.
