BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The emergence of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) as nosocomial pathogens is a major problem in the US; in Europe, VRE nosocomial infections are uncommon and only rarely have been reported in Pediatric or Neonatal Units. The aim of this study is to report on the clinical and microbiological features of VRE infections in 3 children given hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Five episodes of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VREF) infection were diagnosed in 3 children given an allogeneic HSCT. Molecular methods, such as random amplification of polymorphic DNA (RAPD) fingerprinting and automated ribotyping, were used in order to define the circulation of strains. RESULTS: All the isolates were resistant to all commercially available agents and showed the VanA genotypic profile. All children were successfully treated with the combination of quinupristin/dalfopristin (QD) plus teicoplanin (TEC), although treatment was not sufficient to eradicate the micro-organism promptly from the gastrointestinal tract. All our children are still alive. After the first isolation of VRE, a surveillance protocol was started and we documented that the rate of colonization in children and their mothers was less than 1.5%. The RAPD method demonstrated the possible nosocomial transmission of one strain. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Our experience demonstrates that VRE infection is a life-threatening complication in children given HSCT. Prompt diagnosis of this infection and its treatment with the combination of QD and TEC can successfully manage this severe infection in profoundly immunocompromised patients.
