Few vectors suitable for cloning in Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, a periodontal pathogen, have been described. These plasmids were based either on the native A. actinomycetemcomitans replicon, pVT736-1, or derivatives of the IncP and IncQ family of plasmids. Their usefulness as cloning vectors is limited because of instability or size. Therefore, the ability of additional replicons to function in A. actinomycetemcomitans was evaluated. Derivatives of p15A, ColE1/f1, and pWV01 transformed A. actinomycetemcomitans efficiently and exhibited no structural instability in the new host. The stable maintenance of A. actinomycetemcomitans-specific DNA fragments inserted into the p15A derivative, pDMG4, demonstrated the ability of this plasmid to function as a cloning vector. In addition, pVT736-1 was used to clone selectable markers directly into A. actinomycetemcomitans. These constructs were structurally and segregationally stable.
