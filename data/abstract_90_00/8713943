The place and role of surgical, dental physio- and pharmacotherapy in oral and head and neck diseases has been debated for decades. In addition the price and reimbursement system had been changed lately in our country that also underlines the relevance of this issue. The overconsumption (1.7 packages per inhabitant per year) of antibiotics is also proven in Hungary. Beside surgical and dental interventions the treatment of dental inflammations caused by pathogenics requires the administration of different kinds of antibiotics. The first choice antibiotic is determined on the base of clinical features and general resistance of oral flora in the given period. When the first choice antibiotic proves to be ineffective, treatment has to be followed by antibiotics determined on individual resistance. In stomatology antibiotics are administered for prevention or treatment of dental inflammations. The length of therapy has a great importance which is usually 4 days in prevention and 5 days in treatment of dental inflammations. The modern antibiotics have to comply with the following requirements: efficacy, safety and cost-effectiveness. The typical mistakes in the administration of antibiotics can be avoided by the application of therapeutical schedules. The macrolide and cephalosporin derivates have become more and more popular. The mixed bacterium flora has been changing in time and also influenced by geographical factors depending on the habit of prescriptions. Therefore the experiences obtained in other countries are not applicable.
