A 56-year old man with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and biliary tract endoprosthesis, developed chronic bacteremia caused by Enterococcus faecalis with high-level resistance to gentamicin and streptomycin. The sources of bacteremia were a device-associated biliary tract infection, a suppurative thrombophlebitis of the confluence of the superior mesenteric vein with the splenic vein as well as multiple liver and pancreatic abscesses. Despite antibiotic therapy and multiple drainages of abscesses, the patient died due to overwhelming infection.
