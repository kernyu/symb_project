The fibrin clot penetration and in vivo bactericidal activity of RP 59500, a new semisynthetic streptogramin, for two Staphylococcus aureus strains (one methicillin resistant and the other methicillin susceptible), two Staphylococcus epidermidis strains (one methicillin resistant and the other methicillin susceptible), and one Enterococcus faecalis strain were evaluated. The clots, inserted subcutaneously, were infected with a mean of 10(8) CFU of the pathogen per g. For each strain, groups of four rabbits received a single intravenous injection of 50 mg of RP 59500 per kg of body weight over 30 min. The mean peak level of RP 59500 in serum in the infected rabbits was 61.9 +/- 6.3 micrograms/ml. The drug was detectable in serum at a level of 0.8 micrograms/ml up to 4 h after administration. The mean peak fibrin clot drug level at 1 h was 3.3 +/- 0.1 micrograms/g. At 6 h, the level in clots was 1.2 +/- 0.1 micrograms/g. The mean half-life in serum in infected rabbits was 0.34 +/- 0.01 h, while in clots the drug exhibited a longer half-life of 3.8 +/- 0.4 h. In vivo, this new streptogramin sterilized the clots infected with the two S. aureus strains studied in less than 1 h and induced a marked reduction in colony counts of the two S. epidermidis strains studied for up to 24 h. The activity of the streptogramin against E. faecalis was limited. These results suggest that RP 59500 should be further evaluated for the treatment of infection with methicillin-resistant staphylococci.
