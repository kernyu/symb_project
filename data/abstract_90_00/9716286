As the problem of global antibiotic resistance continues to worsen, aminoglycosides have assumed increasing importance in clinical practice. Their broad antimicrobial spectrum, rapid bactericidal action, and ability to act synergistically with other drugs have made them especially useful in the treatment of serious nosocomial infections. However, as with other drugs, their overuse and misuse leads to the development of resistance in important microbial pathogens. The appropriate use of the aminoglycosides is essential to assure their continued efficacy. Therefore, physicians must familiarize themselves with both the clinical indications and the limitations of these drugs if they are to remain efficacious in the years to come.
