Amphotericin B and fluconazole susceptibilities of 13 Cryptococcus neoformans isolates from five patients with recurrent cryptococcal meningitis were determined. For each patient, serial isolates showed no increase in antibiotic resistance relative to the initial isolate. For these patients, recurrent disease was not due to drug resistance but may reflect changes in immune function and/or poor compliance.
