The clinical outlook for adults with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) has improved with the use of intensive chemotherapy. Complete remissions (CR) are achieved in 80% of adults but the majority relapse on maintenance chemotherapy and a few exhibit primary resistance to induction therapy. This report compares the various salvage treatments and provides guidance in selecting a regimen with the optimum clinical outcome. Regimens using high-dose ara-C (HDAC) in combination with mitoxantrone, amsacrine, or idarubicin are superior to HDAC alone or with L-asparaginase. The sequential administration of methotrexate and L-asparaginase is equally effective. The duration of second CR is short for all chemotherapeutic regimens.
