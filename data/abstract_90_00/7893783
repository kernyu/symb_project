Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has been detected in nursing homes and long-term care facilities. Studies disagree about the risk of infection with MRSA in colonized patients. MRSA colonization and infection were tracked for one year in all admissions to a 60-bed ward at the Philadelphia VA Nursing Home Care Unit (NHCU) from the time of its opening in June, 1990. Patients and staff were blinded to culture results, and the NHCU followed universal precautions for all patients. Of the first 72 patients, 7 were found to be colonized with MRSA; only one of them was known to have had MRSA prior to NHCU transfer. Three patients died (2 had negative cultures prior to death), and 1 was discharged home. Three patients spontaneously cleared MRSA colonization and lived to the end of the study. Three patients appeared to be colonized by MRSA after admission; subsequent cultures were negative. No patients were infected by MRSA in the NHCU. At the close of the study, one year after the nursing home opened, no patient in the nursing home had a culture positive for MRSA. In conclusion, colonization with MRSA at the time of admission to the nursing home is not uncommon, but patients can spontaneously clear it. Besides, nursing homes that pre-screen only those patients with classic risk factors may be admitting many MRSA-colonized patients. Nonetheless, universal precautions appear to be effective in limiting transmission of MRSA in the nursing home; in this study, MRSA acquisition was sporadic and brief.
