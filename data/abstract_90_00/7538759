Bacillus subtilis small cytoplasmic RNA (scRNA) is a member of a signal recognition particle (SRP)-like RNA family. To analyze the function of scRNA in protein synthesis, a B. subtilis strain SC201NA was constructed in which the expression of intact scRNA is regulated by an IPTG-inducible promoter. In this strain, depletion of scRNA leads to deficient translation and sporulation as well as morphological changes. In addition, the growth of SC201NA in the absence of IPTG became fusidic-acid resistant. The acquisition of fusidic-acid resistant phenotype by depletion of scRNA suggested that scRNA is associated with elongation factor G (EF-G) in the translation process.
