A variety of endogenous antimicrobial peptides equip mammals, amphibians, insects and plants to defend themselves against microbial pathogens. Defensins are small peptides of mammalian cells that contain 29-35 amino acid residues, including six invariant cysteines that form three intramolecular disulphide bonds. They are produced by the sequential proteolysis of precursors that contain approximately 95 amino acids and are synthesized by several types of cells, especially the bone marrow precursors of blood neutrophils. Defensins constitute 5-7% of the total protein in human neutrophils and are present in high concentration in the azurophil granules and phagocytic vacuoles. The production of defensins by human neutrophils amounts to approximately 10 mg/kg body weight per day. In certain mammalian species lung macrophages and specialized epithelial (Paneth) cells in the small intestine also produce defensins. Defensins are complexly folded, amphipathic, rich in antiparallel beta-sheet but devoid of alpha-helical domains. Their unusually broad antimicrobial spectrum encompasses Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, many fungi, mycobacteria, spirochetes and several enveloped viruses. The antimicrobial properties of defensins result from their insertion into target cell membranes and the formation of voltage-sensitive channels. Given their abundance and broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity, defensins may contribute substantially to innate resistance to infection.
