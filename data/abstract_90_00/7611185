A study was performed to compare Gram-Sure (JRGA Diagnostics, Rancho Dominguez, CA) with vancomycin disk susceptibility (5 micrograms and 30 micrograms) for clarification of the Gram reaction. Eighty-eight isolates representing 14 gram-negative and gram-positive genera were tested. Gram-Sure was superior to vancomycin susceptibility as a predictor of the Gram reaction in a select group of difficult organisms.
