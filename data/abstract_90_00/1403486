Primaquine phosphate, an antimalarial drug, was loaded in erythrocytes by the process of endocytosis. The encapsulation of 0.1-0.15 mg of drug ml-1 of packed erythrocytes was achieved. The loaded cells attained spherical shape and exhibited higher osmotic fragility and lower resistance to turbulence shock as compared with normal cells. Glutaraldehyde treatment stabilized the cells which were noted to be resistant to the osmotic and turbulence shocks. In vitro release of drug and haemoglobin was also retarded upon treatment of loaded erythrocytes with glutaraldehyde. The studies suggest the potentiality of primaquine-loaded, glutaraldehyde-treated erythrocytes as an intravenous drug delivery system for casual prophylaxis and radical cure of malaria.
