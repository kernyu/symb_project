The in vitro susceptibility of Escherichia coli and Pasteurella multocida isolated from poultry was determined to danofloxacin, a novel fluoroquinolone, and five other commonly used antimicrobials. A total of 1737 E. coli field isolates and 107 P. multocida isolates were tested by veterinary diagnostic laboratories in Europe, Japan, South Africa, and North America during the period 1989-91. The antimicrobial susceptibility of these isolates was determined using the Sensititre broth microdilution technique. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of danofloxacin, furaltadone, lincomycin, oxytetracycline, spectinomycin, and trimethoprim:sulfamethoxazole that prevented growth of 90% of the bacteria were 0.25 > 64, > 64, > 64, > 128, and > 16 micrograms/ml, respectively, against E. coli isolates and 0.25, 64, 64, 16, 128, and 8 micrograms/ml, respectively, against P. multocida isolates. Danofloxacin demonstrated considerable in vitro potency against these important poultry pathogens, many of which showed extensive resistance to the other antimicrobials tested.
