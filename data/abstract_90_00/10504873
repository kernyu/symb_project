Two cases of neonatal malaria are reported, both presenting with signs similar to neonatal sepsis. The first baby responded to oral Chloroquine (CQ) with fever and parasite clearance times of 48 h and 60 h respectively. The CQ treatment failed in the second baby and was subsequently treated successfully with oral Halofantrine hydrochloride. These cases indicate a need for routine blood film for malaria parasite as part of initial screening for neonatal sepsis.
