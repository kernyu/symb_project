Sulphasalazine is among the many drugs in the secondary line of antirheumatic efficacy that have both immunosuppressive and auto-inflammatory properties. Twenty-six patients with definite rheumatoid arthritis (RA) were treated for two years with sulphasalazine in a minimum dose of 1 g per day. Four patients presented untoward effects such as: marked physical asthenia, erythema and changes of the dysproteinemia tests which all disappeared when the drug was withdrawn. The first favourable results in the joint inflammation appeared after 4 weeks. Significant clinical and biologic changes were observed at the end of the study thus suggesting the therapeutic value of sulphasalazine in RA.
