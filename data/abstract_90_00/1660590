A number of authors have demonstrated that the schistosomicidal compound, Praziquantel (Pzq), depends for its action upon the immune status of the host (Sabah et al. 1985; Brindley & Sher, 1987; Doenhoff et al. 1987). We have attempted to define the synergistic interaction between immuno- and chemotherapy further, using the murine irradiated vaccine model of schistosomiasis mansoni. In vaccinated mice, resistance operates in the skin but not the lungs; drug targeted towards lung-stage worms exacerbates lung-phase immunity, however, as depicted by the increased number and size of inflammatory reactions in the pulmonary tissues. Parasites are often found trapped within such foci. In the present investigation, light and ultrastructural studies have been utilized to examine the nature and extent of damage inflicted upon lung-stage larvae recovered from day 6 Pzq-treated vaccinated mice. Such studies have revealed that damage involves muscle disorganization, internal disruption and occasionally, loss of the tegument; in the latter case, cells are often seen attached to the denuded lung worms. To identify the crucial cellular effector cell(s) involved in the synergy between immuno- and chemotherapy, cell depletion studies have been performed in vivo. It would appear from these experiments that eosinophils or lymphocytes rather than neutrophils or macrophages are important effector cells in this synergy. Histological studies argue in favour of eosinophils being the key effector cells.
