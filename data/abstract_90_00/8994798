The World Health Organization's (WHO) policy on drugs is based on the essential-drug concept. In order that this policy specifically encompasses antimicrobials, several steps must be taken. Adequate information on the management of infectious diseases should be readily available to prescribers. Continuing education of prescribers, provision of treatment guidelines, and accurate product labeling are important as well. Unethical promotion of antimicrobial products by pharmaceutical companies should be prohibited. Patterns of drug resistance in important pathogens should be monitored. Attempts should be made to monitor drug use in terms of both prescription and consumption. Systematic interchange of information at the national and international levels within defined networks is necessary. The pharmaceutical quality of antimicrobials must be ensured through rigorous registration and enforcement procedures. Collaboration between the pharmaceutical industry and academics must be ongoing. The WHO is prepared to assist countries in developing strategies on the rational use of antimicrobials.
