We evaluated the in vivo activity and the diffusion of radiolabelled RP 57669 (RPI) and RP 54476 (RPII), the two components of the injectable streptogramin RP 59500, alone or in combination, in aortic vegetations from experimental endocarditis in rabbits. RPI and RPII demonstrated in vitro bacteriostatic and bactericidal synergy against a clinical strain of Staphylococcus aureus resistant to methicillin and susceptible to erythromycin. In experimental staphylococcal endocarditis, RP 59500 was as effective as vancomycin and significantly more effective than RPI (P < 0.01) and RPII (P < 0.05). Autoradiography studies showed different patterns of distribution into cardiac vegetations infected with Streptococcus sanguis for [14C]RPI and [14C]RPII. [14C]RPI was homogeneously distributed throughout the vegetations whereas [14C]RPII showed a decreasing gradient of concentration between the periphery and the core of the vegetation, with an approximately 2:1 ratio. [14C]RPI diffused approximately 2 to 4 times more than [14C]RPII into the core of the vegetations. Since the injected ratio of RPI and RPII is 30:70 in RP 59500, the actual RPI:RPII ratio in the core of the vegetation may range from 0.8 to 1.7, a ratio which remains compatible with the in vivo synergism demonstrated between the two components.
