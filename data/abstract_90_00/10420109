AIMS/BACKGROUND: To evaluate in a double-masked comparative, prospective, randomized multicenter trial the efficacy of lomefloxacin 0.3% eye drops twice daily and of tobramycin eye drops 4 times daily in patients with acute bacterial conjunctivitis. METHODS: Ninety-nine subjects were enrolled: 50 were treated with lomefloxacin 0.3% eye drops twice daily and 49 with tobramycin 0.3% eye drops 4 times daily. In all patients, conjunctival swabbing and assessment of objective signs and of subjective symptoms were performed. RESULTS: There was no statistical difference for any individual sign or symptom or for the sum score of either key or other signs and symptoms at any of the examination days. The sum score of both key and other signs and symptoms decreased in both groups at day 3-4 as compared to baseline values (p < 0.0001). The decrease in both these scores continued significantly from day 3-4 to day 7-8 (p < 0.05) and was similar in the two treatment groups (p > 0.4). The lowest resistance rate was seen in lomefloxacin (3.5%) and in neomycin (7.0%), while tobramycin showed resistance in 10 out of 88 resistance strains (11.4%). CONCLUSION: Both lomefloxacin 0.3% twice daily and tobramycin 0.3% administered 4 times daily were well tolerated and showed a high degree of clinical and microbiological efficacy in the treatment of acute bacterial conjunctivitis. Lomefloxacin caused less resistance than other antibiotics evaluated.
