A bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-resistant mutant was isolated from murine macrophagelike cell line J774.1. The mutant showed selective resistance to LPS and lipid A and was almost 10(5)- to 10(6)-fold more resistant than the parent; it grew even in the presence of 1 mg of Escherichia coli O55:B5 LPS per liter, whereas the parent did not grow with less than 10 ng of LPS per milliliter. We next examined the mutant for activation of various functions of macrophages on LPS treatment. This LPS-resistant mutant secreted interleukin-1 and tumor necrosis factor almost as effectively as the parent did. The mutant cells also changed transiently from a round to a spread form; however, they became round again afterwards. The mutant cells secreted less arachidonic acid in response to LPS. These results also suggest that this LPS-resistant mutant responds to LPS and shows activation of some macrophage functions. However, this mutant did not exhibit elevation of O2- generation or H2O2 generation after LPS treatment. Also, treatment of the mutant cells with murine recombinant gamma interferon was partly able to correct the defect in O(2-)-generating activity in response to LPS, suggesting that this defect is probably due to some of the LPS signal pathways. This implies that there is some correlation between O2- metabolism in LPS-activated macrophages and decreases in cell growth and viability.
