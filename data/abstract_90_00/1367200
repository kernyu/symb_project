Streptomyces viridochromogenes Tu494 produces the antibiotic phosphinothricyl-alanyl-alanine (Ptt). Ptt-non-producing mutants were isolated following N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (NTG) or UV light treatment of spore suspensions. In co-synthesis and bioconversion experiments the mutational blocks in the biosynthetic pathway were localized. The mutant NTG1 was analysed in detail. This mutant acts as a secretor for all other mutants. From bioconversion experiments with presumptive precursors circumstantial evidence was obtained that NTG1 is mutated in a gene involved in the alanylation of N-acetyl-demethyl-phosphinothricin. Using a cosmid gene library the DNA region complementing the defective gene of mutant NTG1 was isolated on a 4-kb BamHI fragment. Subcloning experiments showed that a 3-kb BglII/BamHI fragment is sufficient for complementation of mutant NTG1.
