The correlation between rifampin resistance and multiple drug resistance in 236 clinical isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis was investigated in this thesis. It has found that 99.4% of the strains with rifampin resistance were multidrug-resistant strains and 89% of the multidrug-resistant strains were resistant to rifampin. This result showed that the rifampin resistance of Tuberculosis baccilli could be used as the marker of multidrug resistance of Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
