We have selected a human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) mutant strain with a moderate (sevenfold) level of resistance to the nucleoside analog 2',3'-didehydro-2',3'-dideoxythymidine (D4T or stavudine). After serial passage of the HXB2 strain of HIV-1 in MT4 cells, a novel mutation involving two nucleotide substitutions in codon 75 of the viral reverse transcriptase, altering valine to threonine, was seen. When introduced into a wild-type HIV-1 background by site-directed mutagenesis, the T-75 mutation conferred cross-resistance to the dideoxynucleosides dideoxyinosine and dideoxycytosine as well as to 2',3'-didehydro-2',3'-dideoxycytosine.
