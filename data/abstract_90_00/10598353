Food of animal origin has been considered as an important vector for the transfer of antibiotic resistances from animal to man. Such a transfer is possible by three ways: through antibiotic residues in food, through the transfer of resistant foodborne pathogens or through the ingestion of resistant parts of the original food microflora and resistance transfer to pathogenic microorganisms. A literature review and own investigations were performed in order to asses the potential impact of antibiotic resistance in food on the consumer health. In the first report Salmonella and Staph, aureus isolates were screened for their antibiotic resistance profiles. As a result it could be shown that residues in fresh meat or milk are quantitatively of minor interest. The resistance profile of Salmonella depended on the origin (pig or poultry), but only serovars could be identified which are generally not responsible for systemic infections. Staph. aureus isolates did not show any resistances relevant for human medicine. In these cases food can be considered as safe concerning its role as a vector for antibiotic resistances. However, a resistance monitoring seems to be necessary.
