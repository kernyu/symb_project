Treatment of Candida infections with fluconazole has resulted in the emergence of drug resistance, a problem particularly apparent in HIV-infected patients. Frequently, the yeast is also cross-resistant to itraconazole and other azoles. In neutropenic patients fluconazole therapy or prophylaxis has caused overgrowth and infection by inherently less susceptible species of Candida, principally C. glabrata and C. krusei. Consequently, the use of intermittent long-term azole therapy to treat onychomycosis could result in changes in the commensal yeast flora of patients--either resistance or pathogen shift. An 'off-study' investigation undertaken in patients receiving either continuous terbinafine or intermittent itraconazole for toenail onychomycosis (L.I.ON. study) showed no evidence of changes in the yeast species present, nor in their sensitivity to itraconazole or fluconazole. Although intermittent itraconazole seems unlikely to cause problems in this respect, the situation with regard to intermittent fluconazole therapy of onychomycosis needs further study.
