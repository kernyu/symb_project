Acute otitis media (AOM) is the most common reason parents bring children into the primary care physician's office. It is diagnosed by clinical symptoms of otalgia and often fever and irritability and by clinical otoscopy. Organisms common to the nasopharynx usually cause AOM. Many episodes of AOM resolve spontaneously. Because it is uncertain how many and which children will resolve without therapy, it is reasonable to treat all children with AOM with antibiotics. The first choice of antibiotics is amoxicillin. Other choices rest on a variety of factors.
