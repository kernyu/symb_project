In Bauchi State, Nigeria, a retrospective study was carried out among 973 patients on multidrug therapy (MDT), multibacillary (MB) and paucibacillary (PB), and 118 patients on a dapsone-clofazimine therapy. These patients were registered between January 1983 and September 1989. Clinical results and the problem of defaulting were investigated. The most important conclusions drawn are: although relapses occur, MDT-PB can be a valuable treatment; health education, shorter duration of treatment and permission to come less often lower the default rate, but in spite of this, the distance between home and clinic remains a problem.
