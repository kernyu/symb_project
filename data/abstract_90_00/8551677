Multiple Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains with different characteristics are occasionally isolated from a clinical specimen. Therefore, more than five isolated colonies of P. aeruginosa obtained at random from each clinical specimen (47 sputa, 18 urine, 10 pus and 8 others). These were investigated for serotype, drug susceptibility to eight antimicrobial agents and productivity of enzymes, such as protease and elastase. The specimens with multiple serotype colonies were shown in 17% of the sputa, 11% of the urine and 10% of the pus. 45.7% of the specimens with single serotype colonies exhibited more than two different patterns of enzyme productivity and so did 47.1% different patterns of drug susceptibility. Single serotype strains of P. aeruginosa with different characteristics of these tests were demonstrated in 81.3% of the urine, 73.6% of the sputum, 50.0% of the pus and 66.7% of others. We conclude that it is important to recognize the possible existence of multiple P. aeruginosa strains with different patterns of the enzyme productivity and drug susceptibility, regardless of single serotype, in clinical specimens.
