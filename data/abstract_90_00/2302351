The in vitro activity of norfloxacin was compared to that of ampicillin, doxycycline, chloramphenicol, trimethoprim in combination with sulfamethoxazole (1/20), and erythromycin, against 272 clinical isolates of gastro-intestinal pathogens. Norfloxacin was the most active compound of those tested with MICs in the range 0.004-2 mg/l. Concentrations inhibiting 90% of the strains (MIC 90) were 0.008 mg/l for Vibrio cholerae, 0.016 mg/l for Aeromonas hydrophila, 0.032 mg/l for Vibrio cholerae non 01, 0.064 mg/l for Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Yersinia enterocolitica 03, enterotoxigenic (ETEC) and enteropathogenic (EPEC) Escherichia coli and Shigella species, 0.125 mg/l for Salmonella species, and 0.5 mg/l for Campylobacter species. Resistance to one or several of the other drugs was seen with higher or lower frequency in all the bacterial species tested. No cross-resistance between any of the other agents and norfloxacin was recorded.
