The incidence of tuberculosis has been increasing in recent years. Therefore, routine screening with the Mantoux test is important in persons at high risk of infection or progression to active disease. Test results are interpreted on the basis of each patient's risk factors. Persons at high risk may benefit from preventive therapy. Active tuberculosis is treated with multidrug regimens to avoid the development of bacterial resistance. Healthcare workers at risk for occupational exposure should undergo routine screening. Required notification of the public health department ensures that patients receive appropriate treatment and that proper investigation is done to prevent further spread of the disease.
