OBJECTIVE: To evaluate a monthly 'pulse' of rifampicin plus pyrazinamide plus streptomycin in the continuation phase of a short-course antituberculosis regimen. DESIGN: Randomised controlled trial of two 7-month chemotherapy regimens. SETTING: Inpatient chemotherapy and outpatient follow-up in Tanzania. PATIENTS: Smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis. INTERVENTION: All patients received streptomycin plus rifampicin plus isoniazid plus pyrazinamide daily for 6 weeks followed by isoniazid daily for 24 weeks; 50%, at random, received additional doses of rifampicin, pyrazinamide and streptomycin every 4 weeks in the continuation phase. Follow-up continued for 23 months after cessation of chemotherapy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Bacteriological failure rate at the end of chemotherapy and relapse rate after stopping. RESULTS: Of the 266 patients with fully sensitive strains before treatment there was one failure in each series during chemotherapy; after stopping, 5% of the 114 who received the supplement relapsed bacteriologically compared with 10% of the 113 who did not (95% CI for the difference -0.02% to + 11.3%). The results in the 37 patients with strains resistant to isoniazid pretreatment were not as good, but similar for the two regimens. CONCLUSION: This study was not large enough to demonstrate a significant reduction in the relapse rate from 10% to 5%. If such a reduction were confirmed in a larger study it would represent an important improvement in efficacy. further, in an outpatient setting, the additional monthly doses might improve attendance.
