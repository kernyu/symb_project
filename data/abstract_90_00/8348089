Analysis of drug-sensitiveness of 822 M. tuberculosis strains isolated from patients with pulmonary tuberculosis treated in the Institute of Tuberculosis and Lung Diseases and in Pediatric Clinic of Medical Academy in Warsaw in 1982-1991 years was performed for isoniazid (INH), streptomycin (SM), rifampicin (RMP) and ethambutol (EMB). Drug sensitivity test was done on a basis of complexed proportional method according to Conethi and resistance index method according to Mitchinson. Examined strains were determined as resistant when the resistance index was 4 for INH, SM. RMP and EMB. During analysis the increase of resistance strains percentage (mean 25%) was observed in sputum-positive tuberculosis patients hospitalized in the Institute of Tuberculosis and Lung Diseases. The highest number of resistant strains was noticed in relation to CNH and RMP.
