Patients with significant degrees of immunocompromise, such as cancer, AIDS and large burns, who have received significant amounts of antibiotics, may develop infections with yeast organisms. Over a 3-year period, all patients with positive fungal blood cultures and most wounds of patients with large burns considered to be a risk of yeast infection were selected and tested for their susceptibility to five antifungal agents, amphotericin B, ketoconazole, miconazole, diflucan, and 5-fluorocytosine. In all, 244 specimens of yeast were tested: 142 Candida albicans, 52 Candida parapsilosis, 26 Candida tropicalis and 13 Trichosporon beigelii. A limited number of other isolates of Candida (12) were also encountered. All Candida organism were sensitive to amphotericin B. There was wide variation in regard to the susceptibility to the other four agents, with C. albicans and C. tropicalis being largely resistant to miconazole and ketoconazole. T. beigelii was recovered in 13 patients. One-half of these organisms was resistant to amphotericin B. Awareness of variations in species and susceptibility are helpful in the selection of appropriate therapeutic antifungal agents.
