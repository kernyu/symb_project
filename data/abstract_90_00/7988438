We evaluated the role of protein kinase-C (PKC) during insulin action in HIRC-B cells. Insulin provoked rapid increases in 1) diacylglycerol; 2) translocation of PKC epsilon, but not PKC alpha, PKC delta, or PKC zeta, from the cytosol to the membrane fraction; 3) membrane PKC enzyme activity; and 4) phosphorylation of immunoprecipitable 80-kilodalton (kDa) myristylated alanine-rich C-kinase substrate (MARCKS) protein and heat-stable 80-kDa protein (also probably MARCKS). Phorbol esters stimulated the translocation of PKC alpha and PKC delta as well as PKC epsilon, but not PKC zeta. The effects of phorbol esters on 80-kDa MARCKS phosphorylation were approximately 4 times as strong as those of insulin. Treatment of HIRC-B cells with phorbol esters for 20-24 h resulted in complete loss of immunoreactive PKC alpha and PKC delta in cytosol and membrane fractions, but substantial amounts of PKC epsilon were persistently translocated to the membrane fraction of down-regulated cells. This persistently translocated, residual PKC epsilon in down-regulated cells was associated with increased basal hexose uptake, but this was not due to PKC activation, as it was not inhibited by the PKC inhibitor, RO 31-8220. Acute insulin treatment, on the other hand, increased hexose uptake in down-regulated cells, and this insulin-stimulated uptake was inhibited by RO 31-8220 in down-regulated cells as well as in nondown-regulated cells. Insulin also stimulated the phosphorylation of the heat-stable 80-kDa protein in down-regulated cells, suggesting that the residual PKC epsilon in these cells can be activated by insulin.
