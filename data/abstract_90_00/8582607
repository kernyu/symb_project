Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequence data were used to compare the population genetic structures of five species of parasitic nematodes from three different hosts: Ostertagia ostertagi and Haemonchus placei from cattle, H. contortus and Teladorsagia circumcincta from sheep, and Mazamastrongylus odocoilei from white-tailed deer. The parasites of sheep and cattle showed a pattern consistent with high gene flow among populations. The parasite of deer showed a pattern of substantial population subdivision and isolation by distance. It appears that host movement is an important determinant of population genetic structure in these nematodes. High gene flow in the parasites of livestock also indicates great opportunity for the spread of rare alleles that confer resistance to anthelmintic drugs. All species, including the parasite of deer, had unusually high within-population diversities (averages of 0.019-0.027 substitutions per site between pairs of individuals from the same population). Large effective population sizes (Ne), perhaps in combination with rapid mtDNA evolution, appear to be the most likely explanation for these high within-population diversities.
