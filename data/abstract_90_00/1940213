The study highlights the presence of chloroquine resistant Plasmodium falciparum strains in Kerala state, India for the first time. The emergence of chloroquine resistant P. falciparum in a low transmission area is dependent on the imported cases while build up of resistance is mainly due to persistence of resistant parasites which have more opportunities for transmission.
