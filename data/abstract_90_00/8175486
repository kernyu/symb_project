A new glycopeptide antibiotic, balhimycin, has been isolated from the fermentation broth of a Amycolatopsis sp. Y-86,21022. Balhimycin belongs to the vancomycin class of glycopeptides and contains a dehydrovancosamine sugar. The biological activity of balhimycin has been compared extensively with that of vancomycin against methicillin resistant staphylococci and also against anaerobes. Balhimycin is marginally superior to vancomycin in its in vitro activity against anaerobes and in its bactericidal properties.
