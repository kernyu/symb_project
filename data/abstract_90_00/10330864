Fluoroquinolone-resistance is a growing international problem. Warnings have earlier been issued concerning the risk of resistance development due to excessive fluoroquinolone prescription. The development of resistance among E. coli strains isolated from primary care patients with UTI is now apparent in Sweden. So far the majority of these strains manifest only low-level resistance. However, in view of the risk of high-level resistance developing among these strains further exposed to fluoroquinolones, it is important to think twice before prescribing these drugs.
