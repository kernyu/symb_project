Mycotic involvement of viscera and nervous system develops in patients with immunodeficiency, during antibiotic treatment, and application of invasive methods of diagnosis and treatment, promoting penetration of the agent into the blood, which often results in development of mycotic foci in the visceral parenchyma and nervous system. The involvement is diagnosed from resistance to common therapy and is verified by laboratory investigations: microscopic examination of biological substrates, inoculation in nutrient media, serological tests, and histological analysis of biopsy specimens. Etiotropic therapy is carried out by antimycotic drugs with due regard for the agent sensitivity, drug pharmacokinetics, and drug tolerance. Antimycotic therapy should be carried out by a physician with at least the minimal knowledge of mycology.
