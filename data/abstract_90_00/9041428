Zidovudine susceptibility was assessed for 525 clinical human immunodeficiency virus type 1 isolates, before and after reducing the number of replicates and zidovudine concentrations in the standardized consensus peripheral blood mononuclear cell culture assay. We conclude that omitting the 0.001 microM concentration and using duplicate rather than triplicate wells are valid and cost-effective modifications of this expensive assay.
