PURPOSE: Recent advances in imaging and endoscopy has increased our awareness of chronic sinusitis. The teaching has been that chronic sinusitis is mainly caused by anaerobes; however, recent studies have found that the role of anaerobes is small, especially in children. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective study was conducted on 76 adults who failed medical treatment for chronic sinusitis and were scheduled for endoscopic sinus surgery. Specimens were obtained on all 76 patients at the time of surgery and were sent for aerobic and anaerobic cultures. RESULTS: Anaerobic organisms were isolated in 7.6% of the cases, and aerobes were isolated in 76.3% of the patients. The most common aerobic organism was the Staphylococcus species, whereby resistance to the most commonly used antibiotics was 21.7%. CONCLUSION: All past studies on the bacteriology in adults were made before the era of endoscopic sinus surgery and the newer-generation antibiotics. According to our results, it seems there is a change in trend in the bacteriology of chronic sinusitis in adults.
