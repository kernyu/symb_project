The prominence of staphylococci as the causative agent in bone and joint infections suggests that fusidic acid (FA) has a potentially important role in their treatment. FA has been studied in a broad range of orthopaedic infections, mostly in combination with other antimicrobials. For susceptible organisms, particularly Staphylococcus aureus, it has demonstrable efficacy in acute osteomyelitis, chronic osteomyelitis, specialised forms of osteomyelitis such as calcaneal and vertebral infection, septic arthritis, prosthetic and other device-related infections. A small number of studies have also examined the use of FA alone for the treatment of bone infections, with evidence of good efficacy, as well as the local application of FA in plaster-of-Paris (POP) beads, or incorporated into bone cement, again with promising results. Further studies are required to confirm the efficacy of FA in the treatment of orthopaedic infections caused by methicillin-resistant strains of S. aureus.
