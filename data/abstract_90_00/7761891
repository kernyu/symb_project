There has been a proliferation of antimicrobial agents in the market and we can expect many more new agents to be available for use in the hospital and community later. In the outpatient setting, the number of oral antimicrobial agents are varied, providing greater flexibility in managing community acquired infections. Unfortunately, the extensive use of antimicrobial agents has contributed to the development of resistance of some bacteria to multiple antimicrobials. This paper will review the basis of activity of antimicrobial agents commonly used in the outpatient clinic. The spectrum of antibacterial activity of these agents is discussed in relation to the common organisms encountered in general practice. Guidelines for the control of the development of bacterial antimicrobial resistance are also given.
