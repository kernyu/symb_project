Strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae resistant to penicillin have not previously been reported in The Netherlands. Now we have to report the isolation in November 1988 of a multiresistant pneumococcus (minimal inhibitory concentration 2 mg/l) from sputum of a three-year-old child from Poland. We advise isolating patients from abroad (Spain, Poland) in hospital and checking their bacteriological status to prevent introduction of penicillin resistant pneumococci into the Dutch population.
