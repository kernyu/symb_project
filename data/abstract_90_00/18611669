Serovars of Salmonella resistant to ampicillin, third-generation cephalosporins and aminoglycosides but sensitive to chloramphenicol, cefoxitin and ceftibuten emerged in one pediatric hospital of Buenos Aires. All isolates expressed AAC(6')-I and AAC(3)-V enzyme activities, making them resistant to all aminoglycosides marketed in Argentina by the time this investigation was performed. The cefotaxime resistance marker, the AAC(3)-V enzyme activity and Tn1331-related sequences were associated with plasmid DNAs from different Salmonella serovars.
