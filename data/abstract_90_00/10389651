In 1997, 80 and 89% of Staphylococcus aureus isolated from university hospitals in Odense and Hvidovre respectively were resistant to penicillin and 32.0 and 41% of Escherichia coli were resistant to ampicillin. There were low incidences of methicillin resistance in S. aureus (<1%), penicillin resistance in Streptococcus pneumoniae (3%),and gentamicin in E. coli (2%). These figures might reflect the low use of antibiotics in Denmark.
