The number of multiply-resistant bacteria, especially methicillin-resistant Staphyloccoccus aureus, has reached an alarming level in France. This number reflects the inadequacy of efforts against nosocomial infections, and non-respect of hygiene rules by hospital staff. Two mechanisms lead to multiple resistance: the selection of multiply-resistant bacteria by antimicrobials; and, once resistance is acquired, bacterial dissemination by hand-mediated cross transmission. Controlling the spread of multiple resistance thus requires both judicious use of antimicrobials, and compliance with basic rules of hygiene, particularly handwashing. Although the hospital setting favors the emergence and spread of bacterial resistance, this is also increasing, albeit to a lesser extent, in the non-hospital environment. The same measures of careful antimicrobial use and good hygiene should be applied.
