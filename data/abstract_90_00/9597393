Surveillance of nosocomial blood stream infections (BSI) in the USA between April 1995 and June 1996 revealed that Candida was the fourth leading cause of nosocomial BSI, accounting for 8% of all infections. Fifty-two percent of 379 episodes of candidemia were due to Candida albicans. In vitro susceptibility studies using the 1997 National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards reference method demonstrated that 92% of C. albicans isolates were susceptible to 5-fluorocytosine and 90% were susceptible to fluconazole and itraconazole. Geographic variation in susceptibility of fluconazole and itraconazole was observed. Isolates from the Northwest and Southeast regions were more frequently resistant to fluconazole (13.3-15.5%) and to itraconazole (17.2-20.0%) than those from the Northeast and Southwest regions (2.9-5.5% resistant to fluconazole and itraconazole). Continued surveillance for infections caused by C. albicans and other species of Candida among hospitalized patients is recommended.
