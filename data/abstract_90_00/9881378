The in vitro activity of artemether against 63 African isolates of Plasmodium falciparum from Libreville, Gabon was evaluated using an isotopic drug susceptibility semi-microtest. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) values for artemether were in a narrow range from 0.8 to 34.8 nM (mean IC50 5.0 nM) and the 95% confidence interval (CI95%) was 3.6-6.3 nM. In vitro decreased susceptibility or resistance were observed with artemether (14%), to chloroquine (90%), to quinine (32%). Isolate susceptibility to amodiaquine and halofantrine was high i.e. 100% and 98%, respectively. There was a significant positive correlation between responses to artemether and amodiaquine (r2 = 0.45, P < 0.001), artemether and chloroquine (r2 = 0.36, P < 0.001), artemether and quinine (r2 = 0.31, P < 0.001), and artemether and halofantrine (r2 = 0.19, P < 0.01). Positive correlation between these drugs suggests in vitro cross-resistance or at least common features in drug uptake and/or mode of action or resistance.
