In the past, the control of parasites of domestic animals has relied mainly on the use of drugs and pesticides. Although these compounds are still of great importance in the prevention and treatment of parasitic diseases, the accent has shifted in recent years to a more flexible approach, integrating various other control measures. The main reasons for this change are: development of resistance of the parasites against the compounds used; reduced development of new compounds to overcome resistance (increasingly stringent regulations on toxicity and residues, resulting in very high research and development costs, insufficient return for industry because of short life-span of new products due to resistance, and limited and poor markets for compounds against parasites in developing countries); increasing cost of new products for the user; problems associated with toxicity, environmental pollution and residues in animal products. Integrated parasite management makes use, where possible, of biological and mechanical control methods, of acquired and innate host resistance, and of genetical, ecological, sanitary and regulatory procedures, although chemical control can seldom be entirely abolished. Cost-effectiveness and sustainability in all respects are of primary importance.
