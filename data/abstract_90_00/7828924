The amitochondrial (a-mt) protozoa include four groups of organisms that are of interest as important human parasites and as probable descendents of the earliest branches of eukaryotic evolution. These organisms have not been directly compared in terms of structure and function of a specific molecule. We sequenced portions of their rRNA-encoding genes coding for the internal transcribed spacers (ITS1 and 2) and adjoining small subunit (SS), 5.8S and large subunit (LS) rRNAs. Included are sites for RNA processing, mRNA interaction and aminoglycoside binding, as well as potential protein-encoding genes. The ITS of all a-mt protozoa examined are relatively short, but otherwise diverse. They include one or two predominant nucleotides (A in Entamoeba and Trichomonas, T in Encephalitozoon and C in Giardia) and have minimal potential secondary structure, which may form the basis for the preferential processing of ITS sequences. The mechanism employed by a-mt protozoa to bind mRNA may be unique, since Giardia, Trichomonas and Entamoeba mRNAs have usually short 5' non-coding regions. In bacteria, the 3' terminus of the SS rRNA is involved in mRNA binding; analysis of Entamoeba and Trichomonas mRNA 5' non-coding sequences suggests an analogous mechanism involving potential base pairing to the loop of the terminal SS rRNA hairpin. Giardia sensitivity to paromomycin was previously correlated with the presence of a C:G bp near the decoding region of SS rRNA. This bp is also present in Entamoeba and Trichomonas, consistent with their susceptibility. Its absence in Encephalitozoon and other microsporidia predicts paromomycin resistance, and suggests a distinct evolutionary origin for this group.
