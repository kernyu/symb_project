Embryogenic maize (Zea mays L.) callus cultures were transformed by microprojectile bombardment with a chimeric hygromycin phosphotransferase (HPT) gene and three transformed lines were obtained by selecting for hygromycin resistance. All lines contained one or a few copies of the intact HPT coding sequence. Fertile, transgenic plants were regenerated and the transmission of the chimeric gene was demonstrated through two complete generations. One line inherited the gene in the manner expected for a single, dominant locus, whereas two did not.
