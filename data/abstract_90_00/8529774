Lower respiratory tract infections account for a large proportion of prescribed antibiotics and, with emerging resistance to standard agents, the introduction of the fluoroquinolones, in particular ciprofloxacin, has provided a further component in the armamentarium. This review encompasses 37 published clinical trials which featured ciprofloxacin; 3274 patients with lower respiratory tract infections were treated with this agent; in 94.1% of patients treatment was clinically successful and 90.9% of cases showed eradication of the causative pathogen. When these data were supplemented with previously unpublished information from the clinical trial database, specific organism eradication rates of 86.1%, 96.2% and 94.6% for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis, respectively, were observed. These findings suggest that the high respiratory tissue penetration of ciprofloxacin and the achievable minimum inhibitory concentrations lead to acceptable clinical outcomes in lower respiratory tract infections.
