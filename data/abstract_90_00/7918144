Cardiac transplantation is currently recognized as the best therapy available for the treatment of endstage heart disease. Since 1977, more than 650 cardiac transplants have been performed at CPMC, with a one-year survival rate currently approaching 85% and a 5-year survival rate approaching 65%. Throughout the 16-year experience with cardiac transplantation at CPMC, the criteria of eligibility for both donor and recipient candidates have been expanded to include older patients. In addition, pediatric patients requiring complex arterial or venous reconstruction and patients with elevated, but reversible pulmonary vascular resistance have been transplanted with excellent results. With the evolution of prolonged posttransplant survival has come a new group of complications associated with chronic long-term immunosuppressive therapy. These, and issues relating to cardiac retransplantation, continue to increase, largely because of the critical lack of organ donors. Continued efforts are being developed to optimize and reduce the total amount of immunosuppression administered postoperatively. Currently, research interests at CPMC include therapy for transplant coronary artery disease, left ventricular assist devices, and xenotransplantation. Ongoing investigations in these and other areas of transplantation have been established to encourage continued growth both within the field and at CPMC through the 21st century.
