The role of transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) in infection with Plasmodium chabaudi was investigated with resistant and susceptible mouse models. C57BL/10 mice produced gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) and nitric oxide (NO) shortly after infection and cleared the parasite spontaneously. In contrast, BALB/c mice showed a transient enhancement of TGF-beta production, followed by a relative lack of IFN-gamma and NO production, and succumbed to the infection. However, there was no correlation between levels of serum TGF-beta and splenic TGF-beta mRNA in both mouse strains before and after infection. Administration of recombinant TGF-beta (rTGF-beta) rendered resistant mice susceptible because of suppression of subsequent production of IFN-gamma and NO. Administration of anti-TGF-beta antibody to the infected BALB/c mice resulted in remarkable increases in serum IFN-gamma and NO, and the mice resisted the infection. Splenic CD4(+) T and CD11b+ cells of C57BL/10 mice were significantly activated after infection, but this was completely abrogated by administration of rTGF-beta. These results suggested that, in the P. chabaudi-susceptible but not resistant mice, production of TGF-beta was promoted, and subsequent failure of IFN-gamma- and NO-dependent resistance to the parasite was induced. This study is the first to indicate that TGF-beta production was the key event in failure of resistance to mouse malaria.
