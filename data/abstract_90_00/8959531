The antimicrobial susceptibility of Propionibacterium acnes isolated before and after treatment of acne patients was measured. The four female and three male acne patients were treated with an oral acne medication, roxithromycin or minocycline, and/or a topical acne medication, nadifloxacin cream or clindamycin hydrochloride lotion for 1-8 weeks. The isolated strains were tested for their susceptibility to the antimicrobial action of: nadifloxacin, ofloxacin, erythromycin, clindamycin hydrochloride, tetracycline hydrochloride, minocycline, doxycycline, ampicillin, cephalexin and gentamycin. No resistant strains of P. acnes were observed.
