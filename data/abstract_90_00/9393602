Multidrug resistance (MDR) mediated by the drug efflux pump P-glycoprotein (Pgp), may cause remission failure and relapse in patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) by extruding cytotoxic agents such as anthracyclines from leukaemic cells thus allowing them to survive. Cell line data suggest that reversal of MDR is possible using modifying drugs such as cyclosporin A (CSA) and its analogue PSC 833. We have investigated the effects on cell kill of the addition of CSA and PSC 833 to daunorubicin, idarubicin, mitozantrone, etoposide and cytarabine in 52 fresh cell samples from AML patients using an MTT assay. Pgp status was determined by using monoclonal antibodies JSB-1 and MRK-16 and by assessment of rhodamine efflux. Although overall each cytotoxic-modifier combination produced significant improvements in cell kill compared to cytotoxic alone (P values ranged from P < 0.001 to P = 0.017), modifiers also produced significant cytotoxicity in their own right, and no consistent difference was seen between responses in Pgp-positive and negative groups. Up to one in three Pgp-positive samples failed to show any improvement in cell kill with the addition of CSA or PSC 833, possibly owing to co-expression of alternative resistance mechanisms not affected by the MDR modifiers. The best responses were seen when PSC 833 was added to idarubicin, with 7 out of 22 Pgp-positive cases (32%) showing five-fold improvements in cell kill or better compared to idarubicin alone. Comparison of equimolar concentrations of the two modifiers in the Pgp positive group failed to show a significant difference in cell kill, though PSC 833 was markedly superior to CSA in a minority of highly responsive samples which demonstrated clear evidence of MDR reversal. Our in vitro data suggest that MDR modifiers such as CSA and PSC 833 could play an important role in the therapy of AML and indicate the need for prospective randomised trials to assess their clinical efficacy.
