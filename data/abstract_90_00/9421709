The development of safe and effective antiviral therapies for the management of a variety of viral infections has expanded tremendously in recent years. Treatment is now possible for serious and potentially life-threatening infections with herpesviruses, respiratory viruses such as influenza A and respiratory syncytial virus, and the human immunodeficiency virus. The increased availability and use of antiviral drugs, however, has led to the emergence of drug-resistant viruses, especially in immunocompromised hosts. With this review, the major antiviral agents are presented with a description of the mechanisms of action, the evolution of drug resistance, and the need for in vitro antiviral susceptibility testing.
