UNLABELLED: Gram-positive bacteria, notably coagulase negative staphylococci, have become an important cause of infection in neonates. Furthermore, many of these pathogens are now resistant to multiple antibacterial agents. Teicoplanin, a glycopeptide antibiotic, is active against a broad range of Gram-positive pathogens, including methicillin-resistant staphylococci. It has advantages over vancomycin in terms of tolerability, with a lower propensity to cause nephrotoxicity and anaphylactoid-like reactions, and in terms of ease of administration and monitoring requirements. The clinical utility of teicoplanin in neonates with Gram-positive infections has been investigated in several noncomparative studies. Clinical and bacteriological response rates in 173 neonates treated with teicoplanin 8-10 mg/kg intravenously or intramuscularly once daily after a loading-dose regimen of 10-20 mg/kg per day have ranged from 80%-100% and 83%-100%, respectively. Few adverse events related to teicoplanin have been reported in this patient population. CONCLUSION: Teicoplanin (8-10 mg/kg) administered intravenously or intramuscularly once daily after a loading-dose regimen of 15-20 mg/kg per day appears to be an effective and well tolerated treatment for Gram-positive infections in neonates.
