The susceptibility of 101 pneumococcal isolates from the respiratory tract during 1991-1994 was examined and compared with the susceptibility of isolates over the period of 1975-1990. A rapid increase of resistance was seen not only to penicillin but also other antimicrobial agents. During 1991-1994, 38% of all the isolates were resistant to penicillin. The rates of resistance during this period were 16-23% for three newer cephalosporins, 18% for imipenem, 69% for tetracycline, 31% for erythromycin, 20% for chloramphenicol and 9% for clindamycin. The use of antibiotics within one month prior to pneumococcal isolation was correlated with penicillin resistance (P < 0.05). Serotyping of the isolates by antiserum revealed differences in predominant types between penicillin-resistant (19F, 23F,4) and -susceptible isolates (15, 4, 11A). Our data suggests that anti-pneumococcal antibiotics should be carefully chosen on the basis of susceptibility tests.
