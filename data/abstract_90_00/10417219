During alcoholic fermentations yeast cells are subjected to several stress conditions and, therefore, yeasts have developed molecular mechanisms in order to resist this adverse situation. The mechanisms involved in stress response have been studied in Saccharomyces cerevisiae laboratory strains. However a better understanding of these mechanisms in wine yeasts could open the possibility to improve the fermentation process. In this work an analysis of the stress response in three wine yeasts has been carried out by studying the expression of several representative genes under several stress conditions which occur during fermentation. We propose a simplified method to study how these stress conditions affect the viability of yeast cells. Using this approach an inverse correlation between stress-resistance and stuck fermentations has been found. We also have preliminary data about the use of the HSP12 gene as a molecular marker for stress-resistance in wine yeasts.
