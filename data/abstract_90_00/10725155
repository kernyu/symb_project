Sorghums were stressed with pathogenic fungi and sprinkling to determine relationships between changes in chitinase and sormatin in caryopses and grain mold resistance. Panicles of 10 cultivars differing in mold resistance and accumulation of antifungal proteins (AFPs) were inoculated at anthesis with Fusarium moniliforme and Curvularia lunata spores. Panicles were sampled at 30 and 50 days after anthesis, and caryopses were evaluated for chitinase and sormatin using western blots. Sprinkling panicles (to mimic rainfall) decreased sormatin and chitinase in most cultivars. Inoculation decreased AFPs in susceptible cultivars, but resistant cultivars maintained or increased AFPs in caryopses. Grain mold resistance corresponded to induction of AFP synthesis in response to sprinkling, fungal stress, and/or adverse field conditions. Sormatin and chitinase appear to be an active part of the defense mechanism of the caryopsis against grain mold.
