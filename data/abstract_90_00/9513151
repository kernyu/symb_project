A malaria epidemic broke out among French servicemen during a humanitarian military mission carried out in Central Africa in 1996. The purpose of this study was to determine compliance with drug prophylaxis for malaria by measuring blood levels of antimalarial drugs (combination treatment using chloroquine-proguanil or treatment with doxycycline) as well as to assess the conditions of vector control. The incidence density rate of malaria over a 60-day period was 3.1 cases per month per 100 men. Only reinforcement troops were affected. The risk of developing malaria was 5 times higher among new arrivals than in servicemen who had been in the zone for several months (95% CI relative risk = [2.9-7.8]). Type of prophylactic treatment had no effect on the incidence density rate. Study data showed that 40.2% of those treated for malaria were not in compliance with prophylactic treatment at the time of the malarial attack and that those who were in compliance with prophylaxis, i.e. the remaining 59.8%, presented a strain of plasmodium that was resistant to the prophylactic drugs at doses used. Findings also indicated the epidemic occurred mainly because operating conditions prevented implementation of proper vectorial control. The risk of epidemic could probably have been reduced by improving compliance with prophylactic treatment and changing standard vectorial control techniques, e.g. by using insecticide-treated uniforms.
