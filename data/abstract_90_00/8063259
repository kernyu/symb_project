BACKGROUND: Fludarabine (FLU) is a fluorinated purine analogue with antineoplastic activity in lymphoproliferative malignancies. Recently, some in vitro reports have showed the effective role of FLU on the activation of apoptosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The induction of programmed cell death (apoptosis) by fludarabine (FLU), an adenine nucleoside analogue, alpha-interferon (alpha-IFN), and FLU plus alpha-IFN was evaluated in vitro against freshly isolated, chronic-phase Ph1+ chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Apoptosis was detected by electrophoresis gel of DNA oligonucleosomal fragments in 8 CML samples. RESULTS: Only FLU and FLU plus alpha-IFN significantly activated apoptosis in all the samples, suggesting selective activity on CML cells. On the other hand, alpha-IFN alone did not activate programmed cell death. CONCLUSIONS: Our data show apoptotic activity for FLU on CML cells. Programmed cell death may be suppressed in cells carrying the bcr-abl transcript, and FLU might remove this resistance in the neoplastic cell cycle. This preliminary report justifies using FLU in pilot clinical trials for chronic phase Ph1+ CML patients.
