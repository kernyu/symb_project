Most of the Coxiella burnetii isolates (72 of 80) available in our institute share a 2.1 kb NotI fragment. Sequence analysis revealed two incomplete open reading frames (ORF) for putative genes hemA and bcR coding for glutamyl-tRNA-reductase and bicyclomycin resistance protein, respectively. Upon completing the ORF for the hemA gene by sequencing the adjacent NotI/EcoRI fragment a third ORF for the putative prfA gene was determined coding for release factor 1, an enzyme catalysing the last step in protein biosynthesis.
