Strains of Staphylococcus aureus 209P growing in the presence of 20 micrograms/ml of gramicidin S were isolated after the successive subculture on a liquid medium with increasing concentrations of the antibiotic. The resistance was stable and preserved after the subculture on media not containing the antibiotic. The development of the resistance to gramicidin S did not lower the cell sensitivity to a large number of antibiotics known as inhibitors of the cell wall synthesis, protein synthesis and RNA-polymerase reaction. There was observed the development of moderate resistance to actinomycin D but not to other antibiotics interacting with DNA. The gramicidin resistant strains were also resistant to tyrocidine, a membrane active polypeptide. By the amount of the bound gramicidin S the cells of the sensitive and resistant strains did not practically differ.
