The in vitro susceptibility of 839 isolates of Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, 969 isolates of Pasteurella multocida and 104 isolates of Salmonella choleraesuis from pigs to the fluoroquinolone danofloxacin, and eight other commonly used antimicrobial drugs was determined by veterinary diagnostic laboratories in Europe, Japan, South Africa and North America between 1989 and 1991, by using a broth microdilution technique. The minimum inhibitory concentrations of danofloxacin, amoxycillin, ceftiofur, erythromycin, gentamicin, lincomycin, oxytetracycline, spectinomycin and trimethoprim:sulphamethoxazole (ratio 1:19) that prevented the growth of 90 per cent of the bacteria were 0.125, < or = 0.5, < or = 0.125, 8, 8, 32, 32, 64 and < or = 0.25 microgram/ml for A pleuropneumoniae, 0.06, 1, < or = 0.125, 8, 4, 64, 8, 32 and 8 micrograms/ml for P multocida, and 0.125, > 64, < or = 1, > 64, 1, > 64, > 64, 64 and < or = 0.25 microgram/ml for S choleraesuis. These data confirm the high in vitro potency of danofloxacin against field isolates that show significant resistance to several other antibacterial drugs.
