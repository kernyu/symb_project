A systematic detection of Streptococcus pneumoniae strains with reduced susceptibility to penicillin has been realized at Limoges Hospital during two years half. Of 302 strains isolated, 27 had reduced susceptibility to penicillin (8,9%), and, for 15 strains (5%), the MIC of penicillin G reached at least 2 mg/l. The frequency of strains with reduced susceptibility to penicillin increased from 1992 to 1994: 8,2% in 1992, 8,7% in 1993 and 12,2% in 1994. The resistance level exhibited by pneumococcus strains increased since 1992: the percentage of resistant strains (MIC mg/l > 1) was 2,7% in 1992, 6,9% in 1993 and 7,3% in 1994. Most of the strains with reduced susceptibility to penicillin belonged to serotype 23 (52%) and were isolated from blood cultures, cerebral-spinal or pleural fluids (41%).
