In order to evaluate the annual changes of susceptibility, minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of ofloxacin (OFLX) and 4 control drugs were determined against clinical isolates that were obtained from patients with otitis media and otitis externa during the periods between January and December 1993, and the periods between October 1996 and March 1997. The results are summarized as follows: 1. No annual changes were seen for MIC50 of OFLX, but MIC80 and MIC90 of that rose against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa from 1993 to 1996. It appears that resistance to OFLX is increasing among these bacteria. Detection frequency of highly resistant strains to OFLX (MIC > 100 micrograms/ml) was lower than to other control drugs. 2. No annual changes were seen of MIC50, MIC80 and MIC90 of OFLX against methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA), Streptococcus spp., Proteus spp. and Haemophilus influenzae. OFLX showed strong antimicrobial activities against these bacteria. 3. Since there was no large annual changes in the antimicrobial activity of OFLX against clinical isolates that were obtained from patients with otitis media and otitis externa, OFLX otic solution was considered as one of the clinically useful drugs even now.
