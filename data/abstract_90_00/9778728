Iron is an essential cofactor for vital functions in microorganisms. Bacterial pathogens have developed efficient iron-acquisition systems to counteract the defensive sequestration of iron by their hosts. In mycobacteria, the recently described protein, IdeR, negatively controls iron-uptake systems. This protein also has a role in the oxidative-stress response, as well as in resistance to the frontline antimycobacterial drug isoniazid.
