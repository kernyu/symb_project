For organisational reasons, it is often necessary to work with pre-cultures from a refrigerated incubator after a weekend or holidays. It was investigated, whether the cold storage of cultures before the incubation technique had an effect on disinfectant testing. The work with the germs from the refrigerated incubator showed an increased resistance of the bacteria in tests with a phenolic disinfectant. In comparison to control cultures there was a 3 log (10(3) difference in the reduction factors. The decreased performance of the disinfectant did not correspond to a difference in the number of germs. The germ count from the refrigerated incubator was 10(9) cfu/ml which is the required amount for the DGHM-test-methods. The exceptionally high survival rate of the pre-cultures from the refrigerated incubator must have through their pre-test handling led to the increased resistance against the phenolic test product.
