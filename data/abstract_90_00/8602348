Eighty isolates of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans from 30 Brazilian periodontitis patients were examined to determine the distribution of biotypes and in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility. Seventy-seven percent of the isolates belonged to biotype X. All A. actinomycetemcomitans isolates were susceptible to cefoxitin, imipenem and tetracycline.
