Anthelmintic resistance in nematode parasites of livestock is a serious problem worldwide. Ivermectin, an avermectin, and moxidectin, a milbemycin, are potent endectocides commonly used to control these parasites. The proposed mode of action of avermectins and possibly the milbemycins involves the binding of the drug to the alpha-subunit of a glutamate-gated chloride channel, which opens or potentiates gating of the channel and leads to the hyperpolarization of the target neuromuscular cell. Glutamate gates the channel by binding to the beta-subunit. We have cloned a fragment of a putative alpha-subunit gene from Haemonchus contortus. The sequence of the beta subunit is available from GenBank. Genetic variability of this fragment was analysed by single-strand conformation polymorphism in five strains of H. contortus: two strains passaged without drug selection, two strains selected with ivermectin, and one strain selected with moxidectin. One allele of the putative alpha-subunit gene appeared to be associated with resistance to the drugs, increasing in frequency in the three drug-selected strains relative to the unselected strains. Another allele appeared to be associated with susceptibility, decreasing in frequency in the three drug-selected strains relative to the unselected strains. A similar analysis of the beta-subunit gene showed no significant differences in allele frequencies between the unselected and drug-selected strains. Our findings suggest a correlation between changes in allele frequencies of the putative alpha-subunit gene and resistance to ivermectin and moxidectin.
