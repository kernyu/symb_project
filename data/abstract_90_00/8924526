In this work we have evaluated the in vitro activity of teicoplanin and cefpirome to Enterococcus sp. combined with aminoglycosides gentamicin, tobramycin, netilmicin and amikacin. The combination with a greater percentage of synergy were teicoplanin plus tobramycin (70%), continued by teicoplanin plus gentamicin (69%) and teicoplanin plus netilmicin (58%). The combination of teicoplanin plus aminoglycosides results of great utility in the treatment os serious infections such as endocarditis, meningitis and bacteremia by enterococci, in allergic cases, or resistance to penicillin.
