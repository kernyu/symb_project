The effect of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) on the heat resistance of Clostridium sporogenes PA 3679 spores was studied. EDTA was added to heating substrates and recovery media in order to establish which stage of the heat treatment registered the greatest EDTA activity. The heating substrates assayed were phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) and white asparagus puree, at natural pH (5.8) and acidified with citric acid and glucono-delta-lactone (GDL) to pH 5.5, 5.0 and 4.5. Recovery of survivors was carried out in MPA3679A medium in various conditions of acidification with citric and GDL (250 and 500 ppm), at pH 7.5 6.5 and 6.0. The results show greater activity of EDTA on spores when it was applied in recovery of heat injured spores, than during heating. The strongest influence of EDTA during heating was found in phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), with the effect being most evident at 121 and 126 degrees C, and in asparagus puree, at 121 degrees C and pH 5.8 rather than acidified. In recovery, the inhibiting activity of EDTA was more evident in spores subjected to more severe heat treatment, either by increasing the exposure time or by raising the temperature to 130 or 135 degrees C. The pH level of the recovery medium also affected the antimicrobial activity of EDTA, which had a greater inhibiting effect at pH 7.5 than at lower pH levels (6.5, 6.0).
