BACKGROUND: Fluoroquinolones have not received administrative authorization for use in children, but because of multiresistant pathogens in neonatal intensive care, floroquinolones may be the only alternative. CASE REPORT: A premature infant exclusively nourished by parenteral nutrition developed enterobacteria sepsis. Ceftazidine was given initially but resistance led to the prescription of fluoroquinolone. Signs of intracranial hypertension developed 3 days after onset of fluoroquinolone treatment and regressed 48 hours after its withdrawal. DISCUSSION: The main potential adverse effects with fluoroquinone in the newborn are arthropathy, photosensitivity, discoloration of the teeth and neurological disorders. Intracranial hypertension is a known complication of nalidixic acid both in adults and children, but to our knowledge has not been previously with floroquinolone in the newborn.
