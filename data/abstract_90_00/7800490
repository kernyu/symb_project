Lysinomicin, a naturally-occurring pseudodisaccharide, inhibits translation in prokaryotes. We report that lysinomicin (and three related compounds) are able to inhibit the self-splicing of group I introns, thus identifying pseudodisaccharides as a novel class of group I intron splicing inhibitors. Lysinomicin inhibited the self-splicing of the sunY intron of phage T4 with a Ki of 8.5 microM (+/- 5 microM) and was active against other group I introns. Inhibition was found to be competitive with the substrate guanosine, unlike aminoglycoside antibiotics, which act non-competitively to inhibit the splicing of group I introns. Competitive inhibitors of group I intron splicing known to date all contain a guanidino group that was thought to be required for inhibition; lysinomicin lacks a guanidino group.
