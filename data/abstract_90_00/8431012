In in vitro studies we evaluated the susceptibilities of beta-lactamase-producing and -nonproducing, ampicillin-resistant strains of Haemophilus influenzae and compared them with those of ampicillin-susceptible strains. Ampicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, ceftibuten, cefaclor, cefuroxime, cefixime, and cefotaxime were evaluated by broth microdilution tests and disk diffusion tests. The disk diffusion tests accurately categorized beta-lactamase-producing strains and ampicillin-susceptible strains as being susceptible to the study drugs other than ampicillin. Ampicillin-resistant, beta-lactamase-nonproducing strains were relatively resistant to all seven study drugs, but the disk diffusion test did not always predict that resistance. The clinical relevance of the decreased susceptibility to various agents remains unclear, but to be conservative, all ampicillin-resistant, beta-lactamase-nonproducing strains might be assumed to be resistant to other beta-lactams. After excluding that small group of isolates, reliable susceptibility test results were obtained with lots of Haemophilus Test Medium that met quality assurance criteria.
