As Enterococci are now coming up as important nosocomial pathogens, their speciation and antibiotic sensitivity testing is important. 120 isolates of Enterococci from various clinical samples were physiologically and biologically characterised. Speciation on the basis of recommended methods revealed 114(95%) as E. faecalis and 6(5%) as E. faecium. Antibiogram of the 120 isolates showed that 100(83.3%) were sensitive to Ampicillin. Combination of Penicillin and Gentamicin was more effective. E. faecium was more drug resistant.
