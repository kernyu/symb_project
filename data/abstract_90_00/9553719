Many diseases that are candidates for gene therapy require that the therapeutic gene expression level be controlled to ensure biological efficacy and to prevent toxic effects. Various systems have been described that allow transcriptional regulation by artificial chimeric transactivators in mammalian cells. This paper describes these various systems and discusses their interests for gene therapy.
