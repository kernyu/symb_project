The data on the effect of MIGI-K preparation, acidic hydrolyzate from mussel meat, on organism resistance are presented. The effect is based on the ability of MIGI-K to influence the level of endogenous compounds responsible for radioresistance, such as biogenic amines and lipid hydroperoxides, as well as certain parameters determining immune status of organism.
