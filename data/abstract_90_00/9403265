Povidone-iodine sugar ointment is an excellent preparation for the treatment of decubitus. It has been used as an intrahospital preparation made according to the formula each hospital decided on from experience. Although commercial products have also been developed and used, they are too expensive. The efficacy of a povidone-iodine sugar ointment formulation which can be prepared by a single method and which has the stability and antibacterial activity equal to commercially available products was evaluated. As the test drugs, one commercially available product (UP), and three preparations with different formulas (P-1, P-2 and P-3) were used. All of these test drugs were stored at 20 and 40 degrees C. Specimens were sampled immediately after storage and after 20, 60, 90, 120 and 150 days and examined pharmaceutically (measurement of pH value and determinations of available iodine and sucrose levels). For the determination of bacteriological effects, 5 standard strains of 5 genera and 5 strains of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) were used and the time required to kill the bacteria was determined. For UP and P-3, no changes were seen pharmaceutically after 150 days of storage at 20 and 40 degrees C. However, MRSA could not be killed within 30 min. P-1 and P-2 showed remarkable changes pharmaceutically after 60 days of storage at 40 degrees C and could not be used any more. It became possible to make a preparation of povidone-iodine sugar ointment which has a stability almost similar to that of UP. Moreover, such a preparation can be made at low cost. However, since the bactericidal activity against MRSA was not higher than those of other drugs, the future task is to improve the bactericidal activity.
