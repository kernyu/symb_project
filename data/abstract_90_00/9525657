We examined the viral replicative capacity and protease-mediated processing of Gag and Gag-Pol precursors of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) variants selected for resistance to protease inhibitors. We compared recombinant viruses carrying plasma HIV RNA protease sequences obtained from five patients before protease inhibitor therapy and after virus escape from the treatment. Paired pretherapy-postresistance reconstructed viruses were evaluated for HIV infectivity in a quantitative single-cycle titration assay and in a lymphoid cell propagation assay. We found that all reconstructed resistant viruses had a reproducible decrease in their replicative capacity relative to their parental pretherapy counterparts. The extent of this loss of infectivity was pronounced for some viruses and more limited for others, irrespective of the inhibitor used and of the level of resistance. In resistant viruses, the efficiency of Gag and Gag-Pol precursor cleavage by the protease was impaired to different extents, as shown by the accumulation of several cleavage intermediates in purified particle preparations. We conclude that protease inhibitor-resistant HIV variants selected during therapy have an impaired replicative capacity related to multiple defects in the processing of Gag and Gag-Pol polyprotein precursors by the protease.
