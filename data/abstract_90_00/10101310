Chronic osteomyelitis has been a difficult problem for patients and the treating physicians. Appropriate antibiotic therapy is necessary to arrest osteomyelitis along with adequate surgical therapy. Factors involved in choosing the appropriate antibiotic(s) include infection type, infecting organism, sensitivity results, host factors, and antibiotic characteristics. Initially, antibiotics are chosen on the basis of the organisms that are suspected to be causing the infection. Once the infecting organism(s) is isolated and sensitivities are established, the initial antibiotic(s) may be modified. In selecting specific antibiotics for the treatment of osteomyelitis, the type of infection, current hospital sensitivity resistance patterns, and the risk of adverse reactions must be strongly appraised. Antibiotic classes used in the treatment of osteomyelitis include penicillins, beta-lactamase inhibitors, cephalosporins, other beta-lactams (aztreonam and imipenem), vancomycin, clindamycin, rifampin, aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, metronidazole, and new investigational agents including teicoplanin, quinupristin/dalfopristin, and oxazolidinones. Traditional treatments have used operative procedures followed by 4 to 6 weeks of parenteral antibiotics. Adjunctive therapy for treating chronic osteomyelitis may be achieved by using beads, spacers, or coated implants to deliver local antibiotic therapy and/or by using hyperbaric oxygen therapy (once per day for 90-120 minutes at two to three atmospheres at 100% oxygen).
