The injectable cephalosporin cefpirome (CPR) was launched in Japan in 1993. It has widely been used in the various infectious diseases. We therefore studied the clinical and bacteriological efficacy of CPR against infections caused by Bacteroides species, Prevotella species and Porphyromonas species frequently isolated from the obstetric and gynecologic infections. Thirteen institutions were involved in this study which ran from March 1994 to January 1999. The administration dosage of CPR was 2 to 4 gram per day administered by drip infusion or intravenous infusion. The duration of treatment was from 3 to 15 days. The evaluations were performed before and after the treatment. CPR was administered to 194 patients with obstetric and gynecologic infections, and 146 of 194 cases were acceptable for the evaluation of drug efficacy. Bacteroides species were identified in 102 patients. Clinical efficacy in 146 cases was excellent in 12 patients, good in 110, fair in 9 and poor in 15 patients. The eradication rate for Bacteroides species could be in 37 cases out of 54 evaluable cases; Prevotella species in 38 out of 49; and Porphyromonas species in 5 out of 5. The overall assessment of bacteriological efficacy was "eradicated" in 91 cases out of 133 (68.4%). Adverse reactions including abnormal findings in laboratory tests were seen in 8 patients (4.76%). Based on these results, CPR promises efficacy and safety in the treatment of obstetric and gynecologic infections due to Bacteroides species.
