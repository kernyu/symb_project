Plasmodium vivax is, next to P. falciparum, the second important human malaria parasite. In view of reports on developing chloroquine resistance, research on new drugs that are active against P. vivax is necessary. Due to a requirement for continuous addition of reticulocytes, long-term in vitro culture of P. vivax is not practicable. Conventional drug assays, i.e., culturing for a time equivalent to one asexual cycle of development in the presence of drugs, and then measuring propagation, are therefore not readily performed. In this report the in vitro susceptibility of P. vivax to cyclosporin A and a new, nonimmunosuppressive derivative, SDZ NIM 811, was investigated using parasite material obtained from an infected Aotus monkey. The assay was initiated with blood containing ring-stage parasites and was ended when parasites were multinucleate, but before merozoite release. The results were compared with the in vitro susceptibility of P. falciparum to these drugs in a conventional and a short assay. As an indicator of parasite propagation [3H]hypoxanthine incorporation was measured. The susceptibility of P. vivax to cyclosporins was found to be intermediate to that of P. falciparum in the conventional and in the much less sensitive short assay, and SDZ NIM 811 proved to be as active as cyclosporin A.
