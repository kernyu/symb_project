In Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV)-infected tobacco plants carrying the N resistance gene, a hypersensitive reaction or response (HR) occurs to enclose the virus in the infected tissue. Although a contribution of peroxidases to the resistance has been proposed, no evidence has been presented that tobacco peroxidase genes respond to HR. Here, we describe the HR-induced expression of a tobacco peroxidase gene (tpoxC1) whose induction kinetics were slightly different from those of acidic and basic tobacco pathogenesis-related (PR) protein genes. Interestingly, tpoxC1 was insensitive to the inducers of PR genes such as salicylic acid, methyl jasmonate, and ethephon. Spermine activated tpoxC1 gene expression at a low level and both acidic and basic PR gene expression at a considerably higher level. These results indicate that the induced expression of tpoxC1 is regulated differently from that of classical tobacco PR genes in the N gene-mediated self-defense system in tobacco plants.
