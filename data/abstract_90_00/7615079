In this study the antioxidant activities of the hydroxycinnamic acids, chlorogenic, caffeic, ferulic and p-coumaric, have been investigated in peroxidising lipid systems mediated by metmyoglobin. The results show that the order of effectiveness in increasing the resistance of LDL to peroxidation, in protecting LDL cholesterol from oxidation and preventing the oxidative modification of the LDL apoprotein B100 is caffeic = chlorogenic > ferulic > p-coumaric acid. Assessment of the rates of reaction of the hydroxycinnamates with ferrylmyoglobin, a product of the reductive decomposition of lipid hydroperoxides, reveals that the compounds are more effective as peroxyl radical scavengers than reductants of ferryl myoglobin in peroxidising LDL systems mediated by haem proteins.
