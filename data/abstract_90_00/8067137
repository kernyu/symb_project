The presence of variants resistant to disinfectants in the natural populations has been established by original methods and with the use of a complex of indices. The occurrence, levels and spectra of acquired resistance depend on the type of a disinfecting agent and the habitat of bacteria. The study substantiates the necessity for surveillance on resistance to disinfectants, carried out with the use of universal methods and indices, available to practical laboratories and based on a more rational approach to the choice of disinfectants.
