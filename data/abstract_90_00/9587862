BACKGROUND AND AIMS OF THE STUDY: This study was performed to identify the physical and histopathologic characteristics of different sections of glutaraldehyde-tanned bovine pericardium. METHODS: Ten pericardial sacs were obtained from animals aged from 18 to 36 months. Physical tests included shrinkage and mechanical resistance (rupture, elongation, tenacity index). Collagen and elastic fibers were evaluated in Gomori's trichrome-stained sections, hematoxylin and eosin, by PAS and Verhoeff's method. Studied areas were proximal to the great arteries, and the right atrial, right ventricular, left ventricular and left atrial regions. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Results showed that bovine pericardium does not have enough regional differences to identify any single region for bioprosthesis manufacture. However, histopathology showed better preservation of collagen and elastic fibers in the right ventricular region, implying that this area is more adequate as bioprosthetic material.
