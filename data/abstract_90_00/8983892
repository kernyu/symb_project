Eighty-two patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) or acute exacerbation (AE) of chronic bronchitis were randomized to receive ofloxacin (OFL) 400 mg twice daily (39 patients) versus 400 mg once daily (43 patients) orally. Cure rates showed no statistically significant difference (90.1 vs. 94.6%), but more patients receiving 800 mg/day had side effects. Thus, the once daily administration of OFL is equally effective and safer than 400 mg twice daily to treat CAP or AE chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, especially in countries with higher pneumococcal and Haemophilus influenzae resistance in community practice.
