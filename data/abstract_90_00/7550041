Physiopathology of malaria, and the immune reactions to this infection are poorly understood. Infection by P. falciparum is potentially fatal, and acquires an important position, both in the pathology of tropical countries as in imported pathology. Outside of endemic areas, diagnosis of the infection is important but sometimes difficult. Problems linked with malaria are compounded by the growing resistance of the infecting parasite to the classical drugs. A worldwide effort to identify new drugs has only led to partially satisfying results. It is possible that derivatives of a chinese medication, "Quing-Hao-Shu" open new perspectives for the treatment of malaria.
