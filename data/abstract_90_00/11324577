Cell viability and cell membrane disruption of rat astrocyte after heat shock response (HSR) were assessed by the analysis of MTT reduction and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release. We studied whether HSR would modulate the susceptibility of astrocyte to H2O2-induced oxidative stress. Cell viability was assessed by reduction of MTT. HSR in 43 degrees C water bath for 30 min decreased H2O2 toxicity (P < 0.01) to astrocyte. HSR induced decrease in H2O2 (50 mumol/L) toxicity was also shown by the reduction in the release of LDH, which was a marker of cell membrane disruption. The result also showed that prior to the incubation in 43 degrees C water bath for 30 min strongly increased IL-6 release 6 h (P < 0.05) after HSR. The above data suggest that the enhanced release of IL-6 from astrocyte may be one of the mechanisms underlying the cell protective effect induced by HSR.
