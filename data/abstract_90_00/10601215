In five vancomycin-resistant laboratory step mutants selected from the highly and homogeneously methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strain COL (MIC of methicillin, 800 microg/ml; MIC of vancomycin, 1.5 microg/ml), the gradually increasing levels of resistance to vancomycin were accompanied by parallel decreases in the levels of methicillin resistance and abnormalities in cell wall metabolism. The latter included a gradual reduction in the proportion of highly cross-linked muropeptide species in peptidoglycan, down-regulation of the production of penicillin-binding protein 2A (PBP2A) and PBP4, and hypersensitivity to beta-lactam antibiotics each with a relatively selective affinity for the various staphylococcal PBPs; the PBP2-specific inhibitor ceftizoxime was particularly effective.
