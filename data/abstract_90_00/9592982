BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Idarubicin, an anthracycline analogue, is active in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. This study evaluates the efficacy and toxicity of a combination of idarubicin, etoposide and intermediate-dose cytarabine (IVA) in unfavorable lymphoma in relapse or resistant to prior doxorubicin- or novantrone-based regimens. DESIGN AND METHODS: Thirty patients with relapsing or resistant unfavorable lymphoma received a combination of idarubicin 12 mg/m2 i.v. on day 1, etoposide 60 mg/m2 i.v. every 12 hours for 3 days, and Ara-C 1 g/m2 i.v. every 12 hours for 3 days (3-hour infusion). Median age was 39 years (range: 22-60). All patients had been given prior doxorubicin or novantrone; 54% of them had received 2 or more chemotherapy regimens; 67% of total were in clinical relapse (30% in their second relapse), and 23% had resistant disease. RESULTS: The overall response rate to IVA was 60% (18 of 30 patients). Complete remission rate was 20% (6 of 30) in the whole group, 45% (5 of 11) among patients in their first relapse. Remission median duration was 9 months (range: 1-18), with a 3-year relapse-free and overall survival of 20% and 15%, respectively. Severe neutropenia occurred in 13 patients (43%) and severe thrombocytopenia in 11 patients (37%), with a median duration of 9 and 13 days, respectively. No cardiac toxicity developed; sepsis during neutropenia was documented in four instances and two patients (7%) died of therapy-related events (septic shock). INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Idarubicin combined with etoposide and intermediate-dose cytarabine proved to be an active salvage therapy in unfavorable lymphoma given prior doxorubicin or novantrone; the best results were obtained among patients in their first relapse, with low tumor burden.
