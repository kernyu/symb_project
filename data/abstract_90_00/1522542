Isolates (UCH-23 and OM) and cloned strains of Plasmodium falciparum (Clones W-2 and D-6) were maintained in continuous culture for 28 to 150 days using culture media supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat inactivated semi-immune human plasma. Microscopic appearance and growth rates (R) of the parasites in media supplemented with semi-immune human plasma [R = 1.13 (W-2), 0.92 (D-6), 0.75 (OM) and 0.84 (UCH-23)] were comparable to those of parallel cultures maintained in media supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat inactivated non-immune human plasma [R = 1.42 (W-2), 0.83 (D-6), 0.66 (OM) and 0.89 (UCH-23)]. In addition, IC50 for chloroquine and mefloquine against the two cloned strains of P. falciparum maintained in culture media supplemented with either non-immune human plasma or semi-immune human plasma were identical. Although growth rates of new isolates (UCH-23 and OM) fluctuated over time, they stabilized between the 12th and 19th day of adaptation to culture. This fluctuation in growth rates of the new isolates underscores the influence of population dynamics during adaptation of P. falciparum to continuous culture. Sixty-eight percent of the primary isolates (170 of 250) obtained from patients in Ibadan were successfully adapted and maintained in continuous culture using semi-immune human plasma. The results of these studies indicate that semi-immune human plasma is a suitable supplement for continuous cultivation and drug susceptibility testing of P. falciparum.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
