Antimicrobial susceptibility of common bacterial species occurring on human skin appears to be falling. Data for the antimicrobial susceptibility of major groups of bacteria isolated from human skin during routine cultures were complied and analysed over a period of 9 months. Routine diagnostics of specimens from skin lesions and normal human skin were analysed for the presence of specified groups of bacteria. The species were identified using standard methods. Anti-microbial susceptibility was determined using a broth microdilution system giving breakpoints, the Sensititre system. Of the 333 Staphylococcus aureus, 129 Streptococcaceae, 180 Enterobacteriaceae and 120 Pseudomonadaceae strains investigated more than 5% of Staphylococcus aureus strains were resistant to flucloxacillin and thus methicillin (MRSA). More than 25% of Staphylococcus aureus strains were resistant to tetracycline and erythromycin. Many MRSA strains were found multi-resistant. Gentamicin was active against a large majority of Enterobacteriaceae strains but many Pseudomonadaceae strains were resistant. Compared with previous corresponding surveys methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains are clearly on the increase. To prevent a further increase of resistant strains a defined strategy for antibiotic use is needed in dermatology.
