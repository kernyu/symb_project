Expression of certain variants of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) in mammalian cells protects them from methotrexate. Retroviral transfer of the gene for such a variant DHFR into hematopoietic cells might permit selection of modified cells in vivo by antifolate administration or alleviate antifolate-induced myelosuppression in patients receiving antifolate therapy. We examined protection of cells of the human lymphoblastoid line, CCRF-CEM, transduced with variants of mouse DHFR. In transduced cells selected with G418 but not with antifolate, the variant that had arginine substituted for leucine 22 did not protect against either methotrexate or trimetrexate; however, four other variants did offer protection, with the best having leucine 22 changed to tyrosine. Polyclonal cultures transduced with the different variants express DHFR at about the same level, but clones within each polyclonal population differ in DHFR expression levels and in resistance. These differences in expression were shown to reflect different integration sites for proviral DNA. Exposure to trimetrexate selects highly resistant clones, with high expression due to both high copy number and integration sites that are favorable for expression. Differences in the resistance of cultures expressing different variants at the same level are due to differences in the catalytic activity of the expressed DHFR, its affinity for antifolates, and its stability.
