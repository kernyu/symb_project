Susceptibility testing of 1,688 Haemophilus influenzae isolates found 484 ampicillin-resistant strains; 474 strains (28.4%) were beta-lactamase positive, and 5 strains (0.4%) were non-beta-lactamase producers. Restriction enzyme digestion of the beta-lactamase amplicon determined that, of 157 strains, 11 (7.0%) contained ROB-1 beta-lactamase and 146 (93.0%) contained a TEM-type beta-lactamase.
