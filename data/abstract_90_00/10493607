The in-vitro activities of gatifloxacin, trovafloxacin, levofloxacin, sparfloxacin, ofloxacin, and ciprofloxacin were tested against 9,682 clinical bacterial isolates from 20 European university hospitals participating in the European SENTRY surveillance programme. Gatifloxacin and trovafloxacin exhibited the highest activities against gram-positive cocci, while levofloxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and gatifloxacin were the most active against Enterobacteriaceae. Ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin showed the highest antimicrobial activities against Pseudomonas spp., while gatifloxacin and trovafloxacin were the most active against Acinetobacter spp. and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. All Haemophilus spp. and Moraxella catarrhalis isolates were fully susceptible to all quinolones tested. Overall, the new quinolones, showed improved activity against gram-positive cocci and gram-negative non-fermenters while retaining their broad-spectrum activity against gram-negative bacilli.
