The antibiotic susceptibility pattern of Vibrio cholerae O139, Bengal, an emerging intestinal pathogen has been determined by the Kirby Bauer technique and the MIC values of some antibiotics against these strains by agar dilution technique. All the strains were susceptible to tetracycline, norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin and a majority was susceptible to gentamicin (95.7%) and nalidixic acid (82.9%). Only 51% were susceptible to cefotaxime and most strains were resistant to furazolidone (95.7%), ampicillin (87.3%) and co-trimoxazole (91.5%). The study shows the importance of judicious use of antibiotics in cholera cases and the need for monitoring the susceptibility status of these strains particularly because of their ability to cause extra-intestinal infections like septicaemia.
