The mechanisms of resistance to trimethoprim in eleven U.K. clinical isolates of Haemophilus influenzae were studied. The levels of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) activities in crude extracts from four resistant wild-types were similar to those in susceptible controls. However, activities in extracts from the other seven resistant wild-type isolates, and transformants of two of these, were at least triple those in the sensitive strains. Resistance to trimethoprim was also selected for in vitro during prolonged exposure to the drug and was associated with increased levels of DHFR specific activity in the mutants. DHFR enzymes were, however, still very susceptible to inhibition by trimethoprim. Activities in four extracts, including one from a transformant of a resistant mutant, were reduced by at least 45% following incubation with 10(-8) M trimethoprim. The results suggested that overproduction of the chromosomal DHFR enzyme may be the resistance mechanism in some organisms. The much lower DHFR activities measured in extracts from other resistant isolates may reflect synthesis of chromosomal enzymes that have reduced susceptibility to trimethoprim.
