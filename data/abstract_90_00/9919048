Puncture wounds are common in children, and most are uncomplicated. For children who have a delayed presentation or signs of infection, consider the possibility of a retained foreign body. The diagnosis of P aeruginosa osteochondritis should be considered in any child who exhibits persistent signs and symptoms after puncture wounds; timely use of laboratory tests, radiologic imaging, and orthopedic referral is required.
