A total of 199 clinical strains of Yersinia enterocolitica serotype O3, biotype 4 were tested for their susceptibility to antibiotics (158 strains carried the virulence plasmid pYV and 41 strains did not). 114 isolates were tested by standard disk diffusion method for 21 antibiotics. Almost all tested strains were resistant to ampicillin and cefazolin and susceptible to amoxycillin/clavulanate, cefaclor, cefamandole, cefuroxime, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, aztreonam, imipenem, gentamicin, amikacin, netilmicin, tetracycline, doxycycline, chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin, sulphamethoxazole, co-trimoxazole, trimethoprim and furazolidone. In addition minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 15 antibiotics were determined by agar dilution method for all 199 strains (158 plasmid positive and 41 strains plasmid negative). Third-generation cephalosporins such as cefotaxime and ceftriaxone and a fluoroquinolone (ciprofloxacin) were the most active antimicrobial agents, tested followed by aztreonam, imipenem, trimethoprim, tetracycline, gentamicin, chloramphenicol, amoxycillin/clavulanate, cefaclor, cefuroxime, amikacin, furazolidone and sulphamethoxazole. The present study demonstrated a high susceptibility of clinical strains of Y. enterocolitica to most of the tested antibiotics. In general, there was no significant difference between susceptibility of virulence plasmid pYV positive and virulence plasmid negative strains to antibacterial agents.
