The in vitro activity of trovafloxacin (TRV) has been evaluated in comparison with that of other antimicrobial agents against 5671 clinical isolates recovered by representative institutions of different provinces in our country. The resistance percentage to gentamicin and third generation cephalosporins among enterobacteriaceae was high: 17% and 16% respectively, with a considerable variation according to the analyzed species. The resistance to ciprofloxacin (CIP) and TRV affected approximately 9% of the isolates, without significant differences between both drugs. Fluoroquinolones (FQ) presented excellent activity on 166 isolates of Salmonella spp., 208 of Shigella flexneri and 76 of Shigella sonnei, where only one S.sonnei isolate was resistant to CIP, but susceptible to TRV. About half the isolates of Salmonella spp. and S.sonnei and almost all S.flexneri isolates were resistant to ampicillin, and more than 60% of Shigella spp. isolates were resistant to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. A 41% of Staphylococcus aureus and 55% of coagulase-negative staphylococci isolates were resistant to oxacillin, presenting a highly associated multi-resistance. The resistance to FQ was also strongly related to oxacillin resistance, but the resistance to TRV was significantly lower than the CIP resistance: 9% vs 57% for S.aureus and 4% vs 41% for coagulase-negative staphylococci. A similar behavior was observed with Enterococcus spp., where 54% of the isolates were resistant to norfloxacin and only 13% were resistant to TRV. Neither Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 193) nor Haemophilus influenzae (n = 139) isolates presented resistant to TRV.
