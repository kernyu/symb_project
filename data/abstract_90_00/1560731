While endurance exercise training has been shown to enhance insulin action in skeletal muscle, the effects of high resistance strength training are less clear. The purpose of this study was to determine the rate of glucose uptake in skeletal muscle in which compensatory hypertrophy was induced by synergist muscle ablation. Basal and insulin mediated [3H] 2-deoxyglucose uptake were measured in soleus and EDL muscles using the perfused rat hindquarter preparation. Neither basal nor insulin mediated glucose uptake, when expressed per gram muscle, were enhanced in hypertrophied soleus muscles compared with control muscles, despite a twofold increase in mass (P less than 0.01). In the EDL, muscle mass increased 60% with synergist ablation (P less than 0.01), however insulin mediated glucose uptake was not different from that of control muscles. The basal rate of glucose uptake in hypertrophied EDL muscles was increased twofold over that of control muscles (P less than 0.05), possibly due to changes in neural input and/or loading. These results suggest that the stimulus for development of increased muscle mass is different from that for metabolic adaptations.
