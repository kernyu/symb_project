The susceptibility to various antimicrobics of E. coli, Klebsiella, S. typhimurium, Pseudomonas, Proteus and Edwardsiella strains causing hospital or community acquired infections were investigated by Kirby-Bauer's disk diffusion method. It was found that ampicillin was the least and quinolones were the most effective antimicrobics for the both hospital and community acquired infections. In general, the antimicrobic resistance was significantly increased for the hospital isolates.
