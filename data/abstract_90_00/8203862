Acute respiratory infections with penicillin-resistant strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae and a beta-lactamase-producing strain of Haemophilus influenzae were established in neutropenic weanling rats. By use of nonsurgical intrabronchial instillation of the bacteria suspended in molten agar, reproducible, acute respiratory infections suitable for experimental antibiotic efficacy studies were established.
