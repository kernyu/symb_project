47 isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were tested for susceptibility to ceftazidime and cefepime by four methods (agar disc diffusion, E TEST and API-ATB). Concordance between the methods is good, but the percentage of strains susceptible or of intermediate susceptibility depends of the interpretative criteria (French Committee for Antibiogram or National Committee Control for Laboratory Standards). An international agreement could be useful to compare the bacteriological and clinical studies.
