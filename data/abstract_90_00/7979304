Genital and anorectal isolates of Neisseria meningitidis were characterized, and their antimicrobial susceptibilities were determined. Twelve of 43 isolates demonstrated moderate susceptibility to penicillin G (MIC range, 0.125 to 0.5 microgram/ml). Two isolates were resistant to tetracycline (MIC, > or = 8 micrograms/ml) and contained plasmids of 25.2 MDa.
