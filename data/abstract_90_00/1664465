5-Amino-7-(2-aminoalkoxy)-1-cyclopropyl-6-fluoro-1,4-dihydro-4- oxoquinoline-3-carboxylic acid and their derivatives (10, 11) were prepared and their antibacterial activities were evaluated. As a result of in vitro antibacterial screening, the compounds having mono- or di-methyl (11d, e) group at alpha-position of amino group were most effective among the 7-aminoalkoxy derivatives. Structure-activity relationship of these compounds is also discussed.
