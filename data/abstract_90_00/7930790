Penicillin (PC) resistance of Streptococcus pneumoniae was tested by oxacillin disk method (Bauer-Kirby method) of the strains collected at the primary pediatric office. The rate of oxacillin resistance of S. pneumoniae was 36.4% in 1990, 41.4% in 1991, and 51.9% in 1992, respectively. The efficacy of oral antibiotics in the treatment of PC-insensitive S. pneumoniae infections was also studied retrospectively in 234 cases. Treatment failure rate was 17.7% in the amoxicillin group, 8.7% in the cefpodoxime proxetil group, while it was 42.9% in the cefixime group. These differences were statistically significant. From these data prevalence of PC-insensitive S. pneumoniae is very high in Japanese children, and amoxicillin and cefpodoxime proxetil can be used for the treatment of outpatients with PC-insensitive S. pneumoniae infections.
