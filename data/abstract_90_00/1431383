Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, isolated from the pneumonic lung tissue of pigs, was resistant to streptomycin, sulfadiazine and tetracycline. This isolate, TA5, possessed 2 plasmids (pTA51 = 3.7 Kb, pTA52 = 6.2 Kb); one of the plasmids (pTA52) was coded for resistance to SM and SA. Another isolate of A. pleuropneumoniae, TA8, also possessed 2 plasmids (pTA81 = 3.7 Kb, pTA82 = 4.4 Kb), with a plasmid (pTA82) coded for resistance to SM and SA. All 4 plasmids were not transmissible and small.
