BACKGROUND: The effectiveness of a chemotherapy regimen including 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and recombinant interferon-alpha-2a (rIFN-alpha-2a) was evaluated in hormone-refractory prostate cancer patients. METHODS: Patients received a continuous intravenous infusion of 5-FU at 600 mg/m2/day for 5 days (D1-D5), followed by a bolus injection of 5-FU on D15 and D22. Patients received intramuscular injection of rIFN-alpha-2a at 3 million IU on D1, D3, D5, D15, and D22. This schedule was repeated every 4 weeks. RESULTS: Between 1993 and 1995, 23 patients with hormone refractory prostate cancer were enrolled in this study. Two of five patients with nodal disease exhibited partial responses according to the NPCP criteria. Fourteen of 17 patients with bone disease showed stable disease. Of 21 patients assessible for response, 9 patients had a decrease in the PSA level greater than 50% of baseline. Bone pain disappeared partially or completely in 8 of 14 patients with this symptom at entry. The median overall survival was 18 months. The associate toxicity was well tolerable. CONCLUSIONS: Combination chemotherapy of 5-FU and low dose rIFN-alpha-2a in patients with hormone-refractory prostate cancer proved feasible, and with acceptable toxicity.
