Antibiotic and disinfectant sensitivities of opportunistic bacteria, isolated from the oral cavity of normal subjects and orthodontic patients, were under study. The findings evidence that oral microflora of patients with orthodontic conditions is more rich in microorganisms that can induce pyoinflammatory diseases than that in health. Among the isolated opportunistic bacteria strains were found that were resistant to both: antibiotics and disinfectants. Antibiotic sensitivities of the microorganisms isolated from normal subjects and patients were found virtually the same, whereas the strains isolated from the patients have shown a higher sensitivity to disinfectants. The authors emphasize that effective prevention of pyoseptic complications in the maxillofacial area involves not only bacteriologic monitoring and studies of the microorganism sensitivity to antibiotics, but analysis of the bacterial sensitivity to disinfectants as well.
