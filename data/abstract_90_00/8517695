On the basis of our previous demonstration of the high inhibitory activity of a series of p-n-alkyloxybenzhydroxamic acids and n-alkyl esters of 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid against the trypanosome alternative oxidase in a cell-free mitochondrial preparation of Trypanosoma brucei brucei, we synthesized a series of N-n-alkyl-3,4-dihydroxybenzamides for evaluation as inhibitors of this enzyme. This class of compounds was selected with the expectation of their having similar inhibitory activity to but greater solubility than the esters and hydroxamic acids noted above and greater resistance to serum hydrolases in vivo. We predicted that such properties would allow an inhibitor of the trypanosome alternative oxidase to be coadministered with glycerol as a means of providing treatment for infections by African trypanosomes. As expected, such benzamides were both more soluble and more stable, some being more active against the target enzyme than the corresponding ester. One, N-n-butyl-3,4-dihydroxybenzamide, was selected for evaluation in vivo against T. brucei brucei. When combined with glycerol, this benzamide was found to be curative. A regimen wherein 450 mg of N-n-butyl-3,4-dihydroxybenzamide per kg and 15 g of glycerol per kg were given hourly in three divided doses cured 17 of 19 mice with established T. brucei brucei infections. This combination is more active in vivo than any other designed to block simultaneously both the unique respiratory electron transport system and the anaerobic glycolytic pathways of these pathogenic protozoa.
