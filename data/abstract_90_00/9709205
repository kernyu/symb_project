High hydrostatic pressure, because it can kill microorganisms, is being investigated for potential use as a nonthermal food preservation method. The objective of this study was to determine the hydrostatic pressurization parameters, pressure, time, and temperature, and a bacteriocin that in combination would destroy 7 to 8 log cycles of pathogenic and spoilage bacterial populations. We suspended cells of Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Lactobacillus sake, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Serratia liquefaciens, and Pseudomonas fluorescens in peptone solution and exposed them to the combination of treatments. The combined parameters used were hydrostatic pressure (138 to 345 MPa), time (5 to 15 min), temperature (25 to 50 degrees C), and pediocin AcH (3,000 AU/ml, final concentration). In general, cell death increased as the pressure, time, or temperature increased; however, the cells developed proportionately greater sensitivity as the pressure increased to 276 MPa and higher and the temperature increased above 35 degrees C. Pressurization for longer than 5 min, especially at lower pressure and temperature ranges, had very little added benefit. Among the four gram-negative species, E. coli O157:H7 was the most resistant to pressurization while among the four gram-positive species, L. sake and L. mesenteroides had greater resistance. The death rate at high pressure (345 MPa) and high temperature (50 degrees C) in combination followed first-order kinetics; at lower pressure and temperature combination it showed a late tailing effect. Estimated D value data indicated that even at 345 MPa and 50 degrees C an 8-log-cycle viability loss could not be achieved within 5 min for all eight species. However, when pediocin AcH was included during pressurization this loss was achieved.
