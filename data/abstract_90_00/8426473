Ninety-seven patients with refractory or relapsed acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), median age 37 years, received as salvage therapy a single course of idarubicin 6 mg/m2 as an intravenous (i.v.) bolus daily for 5 days, cytarabine (Ara-C) 600 mg/m2 i.v. for a period of 2 hours daily for 5 days and etoposide (VP-16) 150 mg/m2 for a period of 2 hours daily for 3 days (ICE protocol). Thirty-six patients were primarily resistant to standard inductive therapy with daunorubicin and Ara-C; 50 patients were in first relapse, three patients in second or third relapse, and eight patients in relapse after transplants. Forty-two (43%) out of 97 patients achieved complete remission, 11 patients died of infection or hemorrhage during induction, and 44 patients (45%) had resistant disease. Of the various variables examined, only disease status (i.e. refractory versus relapsed AML) was predictive for a significantly lower response rate. The median remission duration was 16 weeks; the overall median survival was 10 weeks. Nausea, vomiting, and oral mucositis were common but were rarely severe. No patient experienced treatment-related cardiac toxicity. In conclusion, the ICE protocol is a tolerable regimen providing effective antileukemic activity in patients with advanced AML. The evolution of this protocol in previously untreated patients with AML appears indicated.
