The lysoenzyme preparation from Streptomyces recifensis subsp. lyticus 2435 had a marked lytic activity against staphylococci of different species, spectra and antibiotic sensitivity. Certain strain differences of the cells in the population could be easily eliminated with increasing the dose. The preparation is a complex of lytic enzymes with high antimicrobial activity. It was concluded that it could be considered as a potentially promising chemotherapeutic agent for treatment of staphylococcal infections.
