A DNA fragment of 42 kb encompassing one of the mycinamicin II (Mm)-resistance-encoding genes, myrB, from a Mm-producing strain, Micromonospora griseorubida, was cloned in Escherichia coli using the cosmid vector pJB8. Nucleotide sequencing of the neighboring region of myrB and a computer-aided analysis of the sequence predicted the presence of an open reading frame (ORF) with 254 amino acids which showed great similarity to the macrocin O-methyltransferase (tylF gene product) in tylosin (Ty)-producing Streptomyces fradiae. When a 1.0-kb AluI fragment containing the complete ORF was fused to the lacZ promoter in the correct orientation and expressed in E. coli, a mycinamicin III (MIII) O-methyltransferase (MOMT) activity was detected only upon induction with isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). All these data indicate that this ORF codes for the structural gene of MOMT, and it is designated mycF.
