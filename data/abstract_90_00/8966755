A collection of established cell lines was made by means of their explanation into 15 day old transgenic rat embryos. Some of these cell lines were characterized by measuring the cultivated population redoubling time, the saturation density and oncogenicity. A cytogenetic analysis was also carried out. The phenotypical analysis and studies of reproduction permit to define these lines as transformed immortalized non-oncogenic lines capable of contact inhibition. Cytogenetic studies were performed only on Mos N3, N6 and Mos+Neo N1, N6 lines. The karyotypes of cells in Mos lines were normal, and the karyotypes of cells in Mos+Neo lines had chromosomal markers (2 and 3, resp.). These markers result from arrangements of chromosomes 6, 9, 14, 15 and 17. the "thru deletions" of region q1 2qter (line N1) and region q22qter (line N6) of chromosome 15 were revealed in Mos+Neo lines by the summarized reconstruction karyotype method. We propose that these deletions of chromosome 15 and other chromosomes rearrangements may play an important role in transformation of cells from transgenic embryos in vitro, because RB1 antioncogene was mapped on rat chromosome 15.
