Fusidic acid is a narrow spectrum agent that acts to inhibit protein synthesis by inhibition of elongation factor G at the level of the ribosome. Because of high protein binding susceptibility testing in vitro is affected by the presence of blood or serum. In addition, there is a modest inoculum effect in vitro. A breakpoint of 1 or 2 mg/l is most widely used for defining resistance to systemic treatment with fusidic acid. Fusidic acid activity is principally directed at staphylococci, both Staphylococcus aureus and coagulate-negative species which are highly susceptible. It is also active against Gram-positive anaerobic activity, and shows in vitro activity against Neisseria spp., Bordetella pertussis and Moraxella catarrhalis. It has no activity against other aerobic Gram-negative species. Modest activity (MICs just above breakpoint values) is seen with Streptococcus and Enterococcus spp. as well as Gram-negative anaerobic bacteria. Fusidic acid is defined as bacteriostatic. For staphylococci MBC values are generally 8--32-fold that of the MIC. Interaction studies with other antibiotics give varying results depending on methodology. However, interaction with beta-lactams is generally indifferent, as it is with rifampicin, while aminoglycosides and macrolides appear to be synergistic and fluoroquinolones antagonistic. Fusidic acid appears to inhibit the function of neutrophils and T-lymphocytes at clinically achieved concentrations.
