This study describes the bacteriological and mycological investigation of 212 ear swab samples of dogs with an otitis externa. 11 samples were sterile. Malassezia pachydermatis could be cultivated in 72.1% of all samples, in 21.9% of these cases in pure culture. In 27.9% of all samples only bacteria were found. Coagulase-positive haemolytic Staphylococcus and Malassezia pachydermatis were isolated together in 31.8% of all ear swab samples. Pseudomonas aeruginosa could be detected in 22.9%, haemolytic Streptococcus in 8.0%. The evaluation of antibiograms showed little resistance of staphylococcus to most common antibiotics or chemotherapeutics respectively, but the growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and especially Proteus spec. was only inhibited by a few substances.
