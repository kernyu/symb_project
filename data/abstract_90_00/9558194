A 33-year-old woman with longstanding rheumatoid arthritis and Sjogren's syndrome developed type B insulin resistance (diabetes mellitus due to anti-insulin receptor antibodies) simultaneous with the evolution of her rheumatic disease to mixed connective tissue disease. Cyclosporine therapy induced a remission of receptor antibody mediated insulin resistance and controlled clinical manifestations of her systemic lupus erythematosus and dermatomyositis, but had no effect on the sclerodermatous features of her illness.
