A 6.5 kb DNA fragment containing a chloramphenicol-resistance gene of Streptomyces venezuelae ISP5230 was cloned in Streptomyces lividans M252 using the high-copy-number plasmid vector pIJ702. The gene was located within a 2.4 kb KpnI-SstI fragment of the cloned DNA and encoded an enzyme (chloramphenicol hydrolase) that catalysed removal of the dichloroacetyl moiety from the antibiotic. The deacylated product, p-nitrophenylserinol, was metabolized to p-nitrobenzyl alcohol and other compounds by enzymes present in S. lividans M252. Examination of the genomic DNA from several sources using the cloned 6.5 kb SstI fragment from S. venezuelae ISP5230 as a probe showed a hybridizing region in the DNA from S. venezuelae 13s but none in the DNA from another chloramphenicol producer, Streptomyces phaeochromogenes NRRLB 3559. The resistance phenotype was not expressed when the 6.5 kb SstI fragment or a subfragment was subcloned behind the lac-promoter of plasmid pTZ18R in Escherichia coli.
