The increasing levels of resistance of enteropathogenic bacteria against antimicrobial agents present geographic variations. We have analysed the antimicrobial susceptibility of isolates obtained from 4,364 children under 5 years of age with acute diarrhea, in 7 cities of Argentina. Diarrheagenic E. coli exhibited 74.5% of resistance against ampicillin, 64.2% against sulfametoxazole-trimethoprim, and Shigella spp., 62% and 75.6% respectively. Salmonella sp. showed 35%, 14%, 41.8%, 65.4%, 14.5%, and 13.6% of resistance against ampicillin, chloranfenicol, sulfametoxazole-trimetoprim, sulfadiazin, gentamycin, and fosfomycin respectively. These values are higher than the ones observed in developed countries. Aeromonas showed significantly lower resistance percentage. Important differences in our country were observed, consequently, local trials should be carried out in order to apply corrective measures.
