Malaria in Kenya has been characterised by marked variability in its epidemiology, partly reflecting the obstacles and progress made in the control strategies. The impact of anti-vector activities in the 1970s and before have been observed for variable lengths of time afterwards. Malaria has re-emerged in areas previously with little or no transmission. The recovery of infective Anopheles gambiae vector in higher altitudes affirms the potential for transmission in areas where epidemics have been known to occur. Morbidity and mortality patterns in the otherwise endemic lowlands have become increasingly severe, an observation which would be attributed to the increasing inefficacy of chloroquine. Efforts to promote personal protection suffer substantial setbacks in sustainability inspite of apparent acceptability. There are indications that the mosquito vector susceptibility to permethrin and other insecticides will now require continual monitoring in order to detect development of significant resistance. In this communication, we review some emergent issues in malaria transmission in Kenya and the potential for control as adduced from historical and contemporary perspectives.
