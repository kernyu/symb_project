The state of microflora should be considered as one of the important links in chain of the specific functional disorders involving the spaceflight factors effects. At the same time, there occurs an establishment of nonspecific disbiotic response of the human microflora in the space flights of various duration characterized by a decrease up to a reduction of the "defense" group of microorganisms; by an appearance of unusual microorganisms in various biotypes, by accumulation of the potential of pathogenic species of automicroflora with their succeeding colonization and long term persistence. In experimental animal models to simulate dysbacteriosis and with the use of SPF-rats and primates flow aboard Cosmos biosatellites, the significance of indigenous microflora for preserving microecological homeostasis. Theoretically based and experimentally proven need for increasing the colonization resistance is confirmed by the practical use of the measures to stabilize microflora of the cosmonauts during space flights.
