Enterococcal endocarditis is the third most common presentation in native valves, and it is the most refractory. Unique among the streptococci, enterococci are relatively resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics requiring a combination aminoglycoside regimen for cure. Relapse is common even after apparently adequate therapy and may be seen in up to 25% of cases that involve streptomycin-resistant strains. This problem is magnified by the recent appearance of beta-lactamase-producing strains of S. faecalis resistant to both ampicillin and gentamicin. Ciprofloxacin is being investigated with a number of antimicrobials in the attempt to identify superior protocols against troublesome pathogens. However, little published data is available concerning the clinical efficacy of this drug in enterococcal endocarditis. In vitro studies and preliminary trials with animal models have generally been disappointing with broth macrodilution time-kill or agar dilution proving the most reliable in vitro methods for predicting in vivo outcomes. The urgent need to identify new combination drug regimens is underscored not only by the development of new resistance patterns, but by the well-documented toxicities of conventional therapies. The authors present a case of relapsing enterococcal endocarditis caused by a non-beta-lactamase-producing strain of S. faecalis, which demonstrated high-level resistance to streptomycin but not to gentamicin. Relapses occurred despite favorable laboratory data and aggressive beta-lactam-gentamicin therapies. Cure was achieved using oral ciprofloxacin in a combination drug regimen, which is reported here for the first time.
