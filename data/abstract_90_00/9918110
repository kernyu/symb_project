The poly-2'-O-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)-oligoribonucleotide (poly-DNP-RNA) with antisense sequence 5'ggguguauggaaaagccguc-3' was designed to target the sequence 2468-2487 in the polymerase gene of duck hepatitis B virus (DHBV). The stereochemically pure RNA was synthesized by using T7 RNA polymerase with synthetic DNA template and subsequently derivatized with 2,4-dinitrofluorobenzene in mild basic conditions to make the poly-DNP-RNA with an average DNP/base ratio of 0.7. In vitro studies showed that this antisense poly-DNP-RNA can hybridize with sense DNA and has high resistance to RNase A digestion. These poly-DNP-RNA were also found to be potent sequence-independent inhibitors of the reverse transcriptase activity of DHBV DNA-polymerase. For in vivo studies, DHBV-infected ducks were treated with antisense, sense, and random noncomplementary sequence poly-DNP-RNA, respectively. The data showed that the antisense poly-DNP-RNA completely inhibited the duck viremia in all nine ducks that had been treated with a dose of 1 mg/kg (i.v.) per day for 25 days. The viremia did not come back after 10 months recession. In the sense group, three of the four ducks showed no inhibition, and in the random group, both ducks maintained their viremia. After 45 days of treatment with the antisense poly-DNP-RNA, followed by 2 weeks of recession, PCR as well as QC-PCR assay and microscopic examination showed that viral DNA had disappeared in liver and that the histology of the damaged liver (filled with fat granules) had returned to normal.
