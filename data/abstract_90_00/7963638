We report a case of endocarditis caused by a ciprofloxacin-resistant strain of Serratia marcescens in a 50-year-old female neutropenic patient with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma which occurred while receiving ciprofloxacin prophylaxis. She made poor progress on first line therapy with azlocillin and gentamicin by bolus injection t.d.s. The infection was finally eliminated by a regimen of continuous infusion of azlocillin and once daily gentamicin.
