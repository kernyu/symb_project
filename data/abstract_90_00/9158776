Ten multiple antimicrobial-resistant isolates of Vibrio cholerae O1 isolated from patients in Uganda were characterized, and the transferability of resistance to bacteria of diverse origins was investigated. The isolates were toxigenic and belonged to biotype E1 Tor, serotype Ogawa, and ribotype 8, and possessed a 130-MDa plasmid of incompatibility group 6-C. This plasmid, designated pRVC1, was shown to confer resistance to trimethoprim (mediated by a dhfrI gene), sulfonamides (a suII gene), tetracycline [a tet(C) gene], chloramphenicol (a catI gene), ampicillin (a beta-lactamase gene other than blaTEM or blaSHV), and streptomycin. pRVC1 proved to be transmissible at frequencies between 1 x 10(-1) and 5 x 10(-6) transconjugants per recipient to a variety of bacterial pathogens, including those of humans, animals, and fish. Most efficient transfer was observed from V. cholerae to strains of Shigella flexneri, Escherichia coli, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, and three Aeromonas species. The present in vitro study suggests that pRVC1 may spread from V. cholerae to other bacteria pathogenic to man, animals, and fish in natural environments.
