Some elements influencing the resistance of spores used in ethylene oxide sterilization process control are standardized. Spores of Bacillus subtilis var. niger were produced in chemically defined liquid and solid sporulation media to a total of 12 lots; after standardization of the number of spores, they were challenged by sub-lethal cycles, followed by a lethality study. According to the statistical model applied, there were no differences between the resistance of spores produced in chemically defined liquid and those produced in solid sporulation media. The advantage of the solid sporulation media consists in the larger production of spores.
