OBJECTIVE: To develop effective combination of drug resistance modulators. METHODS: The reversal effects of quinine (Quin) in combination with cyclosporin A (CsA), dipyridamole (DPM) or tamoxifen (Tam), respectively on the drug resistance of K562/HHT were studied by MTT, flow cytometry and median-effect principle. RESULTS: The reversal effectiveness of the modulator combinations was 2-3 times as much as that of each modulator alone. Synergistic interaction between Quin and DPM or Tam was greater than that between Quin and CsA. Quin combined with CsA increased intracellular DNR accumulation significantly as compared with either of them alone. CONCLUSION: There was synergistic interactions between Quin and CSA, DPM or Tam, and combination of modulators with different operating mechanisms had a greater synergistic interaction.
