This article reviews recent controlled studies of treatment for candida infections of the skin and mucous membranes. In general, excellent agents are available for treatment, with reasonable alternatives for the uncommon emergence of resistant strains. Cutaneous infections in immunocompetent patients are effectively treated with topical agents. The major clinical problems that remain include frequently recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis, and oroesophageal candida infections in patients with malignancies and immunosuppression. These often require systemic therapy. A number of treatment strategies have been investigated and are reviewed.
