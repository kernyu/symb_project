Replication of plasmid pBR322 in Escherichia coli cells normally requires RNA synthesis and thus is sensitive to rifampin, an inhibitor of RNA polymerase. In cells induced for the SOS response, however, derivatives of pBR322 were found to replicate in the presence of rifampin. This rifampin-resistant replication of pBR322 requires the insertion of certain sequences of DNA. The replication depends on recF+ and DNA polymerase I.
