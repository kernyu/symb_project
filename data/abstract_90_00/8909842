Risk factors and mortality associated with vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VREF) infection or colonization were examined at a tertiary care hospital by comparing 145 patients who had VREF isolates (cases) to 145 patients with vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecium (VSEF) isolates (controls). The number of deaths per 100 person-days of hospitalization after diagnosis did not differ significantly between VREF patients (1.2) and VSEF patients (0.8). Multivariate analyses found that the duration of hospitalization ( > or = 7 days), intrahospital transfer between floors, use of antimicrobials (i.e., vancomycin and third-generation cephalosporins), and duration of vancomycin use ( > or = 7 days) was independently associated with VREF infection or colonization. This study, which has a large sample size, confirms some earlier observations regarding risks for VREF infection or colonization and identifies factors that may be potentially exploited to develop interventional strategies for the control of this emerging nosocomial problem.
