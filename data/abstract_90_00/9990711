The susceptibility of Escherichia coli K1, Salmonella enteritidis, Salmonella typhimurium strains and their adaptative forms resistant to colistine (Colr forms) was compared with respect to their sensitivity to the bactericidal action of normal cord serum and normal bovine serum. It has been shown that the Colr forms are more susceptible to sera as compared to initial strains. The increase of sensitivity of the Colr forms is connected with structural changes within bacterial cell wall which is the target for complement as well as for colistine.
