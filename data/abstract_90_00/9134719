Albicidins, a family of phytotoxins and antibiotics produced by Xanthomonas albilineans, are important in sugar cane leaf scald disease development. The albicidin detoxifying bacterium Pantoea dispersa (syn. Erwinia herbicola) SB1403 provides very effective biocontrol against leaf scald disease in highly susceptible sugar cane cultivars. The P. dispersa gene (albD) for enzymatic detoxification of albicidin has recently been cloned and sequenced. To test the role of albicidin detoxification in biocontrol of leaf scald disease, albD was inactivated in P. dispersa by site-directed mutagenesis. The mutants, which were unable to detoxify albicidin, were less resistant to the toxin and less effective in biocontrol of leaf scald disease than their parent strain. This indicates that albicidin detoxification contributes to the biocontrol capacity of P. dispersa against X. albilineans. Rapid growth and ability to acidify media are other characteristics likely to contribute to the competitiveness of P. dispersa against X. albilineans at wound sites used to invade sugar cane.
