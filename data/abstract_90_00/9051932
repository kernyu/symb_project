Three groups of anthelmintic drugs act directly and selectively on muscle membrane receptors of parasitic nematodes. These groups of anthelmintics are: (1) The Nicotinic Agonists (levamisole, pyrantel, morantel and oxantel) that act on acetylcholine receptors of nematode somatic muscle; (2) The GABA Agonist, piperazine, that acts on nematode muscle GABA receptors; and (3) The Avermectins that open glutamate gated Cl- channels on nematode pharyngeal muscle. The electrophysiology and pharmacology of muscle and neuromuscular transmission the nematode parasite, Ascaris suum, is outlined and effects of anthelmintics that interfere with transmission described. Resistance to anthelmintics has appeared in some parasitic nematodes but the mechanisms of this resistance remain to be determined.
