Helicobacter pylori shows a rather high variability of several biochemical markers including lipopolysaccharide structures. This study aimed to determine whether Helicobacter pylori has a potential for phenotypic variability and to describe its effects on bacterial pathogenesis. From colonies of three clinical strains of Helicobacter pylori with rough (R) colony morphology, spontaneous phenotypic variants with smooth (S) colony morphology were isolated that occurred with a frequency of 10(-2) to 10(-3), irrespective of growth conditions. R-variant bacteria produced exclusively low-molecular-mass lipopolysaccharide. They exhibited increased lysis in the presence of plain air. In contrast, the S variants produced low- and high-molecular-mass lipopolysaccharide and did not exhibit increased lysis in the presence of plain air. Cocultivation of bacterial cells with AGS stomach cancer cells revealed that R-variant bacteria but not S-variant bacteria effected an inhibition of high molecular-weight glycoprotein biosynthesis and secretion by the host cells. Skirrow supplement added as selective agent to liquid and/or solid media was tolerated to a similar extent among R- and S-variant bacteria, while all variants proved sensitive to metronidazole, amoxicillin and clarithromycin except for the R and S isolates of strain Hp57, which showed resistance to the latter compound. It was concluded that R- and S-variants of Helicobacter pylori may have distinct roles in pathogenesis; nevertheless, these bacteria may be isolated by traditional methods and eradicated by conventional anti-infective therapy.
