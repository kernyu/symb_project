The purpose of the study was to investigate the correlation of in vitro activity with the in vivo effect and the pharmacokinetics of penicillin in the treatment of infections with pneumococci with various susceptibilities to penicillin. We used 10 pneumococcal strains for which penicillin MICs ranged from 0.016 to 8 micrograms/ml. Time-kill curve experiments were performed with all strains. We found that the effect of penicillin in vitro is concentration independent, with a maximum effect at two to four times the MIC for penicillin-susceptible as well as penicillin-resistant pneumococci. The mouse peritonitis model with an inoculum of approximately 10(6) CFU, to which mucin was added, resulted in a reproducible lethal infection with the pneumococci. The 50% effective dose was determined for each strain, and we found a highly significant correlation between the log MIC and the log 50% effective dose of penicillin against these strains (P < 0.01). Furthermore, it was shown that the most important pharmacokinetic parameter determining the effect of penicillin in vivo was the time that the concentration of penicillin in serum was greater than the MIC.
