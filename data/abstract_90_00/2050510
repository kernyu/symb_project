Over 2,000 cases of imported malaria were diagnosed in Israel in the last decade, the vast majority in immigrants from Ethiopia, making malaria a continuing public health problem of significance. In 1988, more than one- fifth of imported cases were caused by chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium falciparum. Since the Anopheles vector is still present in many areas of the country, it is necessary to detect and treat all cases quickly and effectively and to strengthen anti-malaria vector activities if local transmission is to be prevented. Despite massive and continuous importation of the disease, the Ministry of Health has had substantial success in the area of malaria control, through administration of presumptive treatment to Ethiopian immigrants, rapid diagnosis of imported cases and strict vector control.
