Abasic sites represent ubiquitous DNA lesions that arise spontaneously or are induced by DNA-damaging agents. They block DNA replication and are considered to be cytotoxic and mutagenic. The key enzymes involved in the repair of abasic sites are apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) endonucleases which process these lesions in an error-free mechanism. To analyze the role of AP endonuclease in the protection of mammalian cells against DNA damaging agents, we have transfected both the human (APE) and the yeast (APN1) AP endonuclease in Chinese hamster cells and compared the effects of expression of these genes in stable transfectants as to survival of cells and formation of chromosomal aberrations. Although APE was markedly expressed on RNA and protein level, nuclear extracts of human APE transfectants did not show a higher AP endonuclease activity than the parental line and became not more resistant to the cell killing and clastogenic effect of methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). In contrast, cells transfected with the yeast APN1 gene expressed higher AP endonuclease activity and became clearly more resistant to the cytotoxic and chromosome breakage inducing activity of the agents. The results indicate that the excision repair capacity and correspondingly the mutagen resistance can be elevated by introducing, in mammalian cells, a yeast DNA repair gene and verify that AP sites are both cytotoxic and clastogenic lesions.
