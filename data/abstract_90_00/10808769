Several factors influence antimicrobial selection when treating otitis media. In addition to good in vitro activity against common pathogens, the drug should be well-absorbed with high serum concentrations and good penetration to the site of infection. Oral amoxicillin dosed at 40 mg/kg/day to 50 mg/kg/day every 8 hours for 10 days remains first-line therapy for uncomplicated AOM. Second-line agents to treat AOM can include second- and third-generation cephalosporins. The rapid emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria represents a particular problem because these pathogens cause not only otitis media but more serious and invasive bacterial infections such as pneumonia, bacteremia and meningitis.
