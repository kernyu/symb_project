The fluoroquinolones have been shown to be active in vitro against many mycobacterial species, including most strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex and M. fortuitum, and some strains of M. kansasii, M. avium-intracellulare (MAI) complex and M. leprae. Ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin and sparfloxacin are the best studied of these agents to date, and are among the most active of this group against M. tuberculosis and other mycobacteria. Treatment of patients with multidrug-resistant pulmonary tuberculosis using ofloxacin has resulted in the selection of quinolone-resistant mutants in a few patients. Many strains of MAI, however, are resistant to fluoroquinolones, and structure-activity relationships and DNA gyrase studies have been undertaken to identify the moieties associated with activity and the lack thereof. The genetic and molecular basis of quinolone resistance in mycobacteria has revealed both the recent progress made in these areas and the limitations of the quinolones against this genus. Considerable progress will need to be made in resolving these issues in order for the quinolones to become clinically useful antimycobacterial agents.
