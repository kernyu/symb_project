Sakacin A is an antilisterial bacteriocin produced by Lactobacillus sake Lb706. In order to identify genes involved in sakacin A production and immunity, the plasmid fraction of L. sake Lb706 was shotgun cloned directly into a sakacin A-nonproducing and -sensitive variant, L. sake Lb706-B, by using the broad-host-range vector pVS2. Two clones that produced sakacin A and were immune to the bacteriocin were obtained. A DNA fragment of approximately 1.8 kb, derived from a 60-kb plasmid of strain Lb706 and present in the inserts of both clones, was necessary for restoration of sakacin A production and immunity in strain Lb706-B. The sequence of the 1.8-kb fragment from one of the clones was determined. It contained one large open reading frame, designated sakB, potentially encoding a protein of 430 amino acid residues. Hybridization and nucleotide sequence analyses revealed that the cloned sakB complemented a mutated copy of sakB present in strain Lb706-B. The sakB gene mapped 1.6 kb from the previously cloned structural gene for sakacin A (sakA) on the 60-kb plasmid. The putative SakB protein shared 22% amino acid sequence identity (51% similarity if conservative changes are considered) to AgrB, the deduced amino acid sequence of the Staphylococcus aureus gene agrB. The polycistronic agr (accessory gene regulator) locus is involved in the regulation of exoprotein synthesis in S. aureus. Similar to the AgrB protein, SakB had some features in common with a family of transmembrane histidine protein kinases, involved in various adaptive response systems of bacteria.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
