Summarizing the results of treatment in 23 patients the authors propose an effective two-staged method to treat chronic pyoderma. This method is based on administration of synthetic peptide of thymus--"thymogen", which is used to correct the immune status and increase sensitivity of staphylococci to antibiotics at the zones of cutaneous affection. The second stage of this method consists in administration of antibiotics in combination with stimulators of phagocytosis and humoral immunity. The results prove the high efficiency of thymogen application in complex management of chronic pyoderma: up to 73.9% of clinic recoveries.
