Teicoplanin is a new glycopeptide antibiotic with a chemical structure related to vancomycin. The proposed advantages of teicoplanin over vancomycin are discussed. These include lower incidence of side-effects, lower toxicity (especially in combination with aminoglycosides), lower dosage frequency and the possibility of intramuscular administration. There is only a limited number of studies comparing both agents; more studies are still needed before firm conclusions can be drawn. Therapeutic drug monitoring is not usually necessary for teicoplanin; the situation is not clear for vancomycin. There is some doubt whether the incidence of resistance is as infrequent for teicoplanin as it is for vancomycin. Teicoplanin appears to be a promising alternative to vancomycin, but more data are needed on the relative clinical efficacy and the development of resistance to both drugs.
