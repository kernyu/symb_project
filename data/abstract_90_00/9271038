BACKGROUND: Standard neonatal systemic antifungal therapy with amphotericin B and flucytosine can be associated with toxicity, drug resistance and the need for prolonged venous access. There is consequently a need for alternative treatment options. OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy and safety of fluconazole in the treatment of systemic neonatal fungal infections. METHOD: Open, nonrandomized evaluation of fluconazole treatment in 20 consecutively enrolled neonates with systemic fungal infection. RESULTS: Clinical and microbiologic cure was achieved in 12 of 19 (63%) of infants treated. One additional infant received prior amphotericin B therapy and is included for assessment of side effects. One infant with Torulopsis glabrata infection failed treatment. Six infants died of Gram-negative bacterial infection and other intercurrent medical problems. CONCLUSION: Fluconazole appeared to be safe and effective for treatment of systemic candidal infection in the neonate although more data are required in very low birth weight infants.
