A shared antigenic teichoic acid, previously found to be a surface capsule-like polysaccharide, was isolated from clinical isolates of Enterococcus faecalis and vancomycin-resistant E. faecium. It was composed of glucose, glycerol, and phosphate as determined by chemical and GC-MS analysis. The repeating-unit structure was elucidated by a series of 1H, 13C, and 31P NMR spectroscopy to be the following: [formula: see text]
