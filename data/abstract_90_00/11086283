The molecular mechanisms of azole resistance in Candida albicans include alterations in the target enzyme (lanosterol 14-demethylase) and overexpression of efflux transporters that decrease the intracellular concentration of the drug. Although the rate of azole resistance in systemic isolates of C. albicans remains very low, resistance to fluconazole appears as an important issue in the management of oropharyngeal candidiasis (OPC) in patients with AIDS. In order to establish the prevalence of resistance to azole antifungal agents in this setting, we investigated the molecular mechanisms of resistance to azoles in highly resistant C. albicans isolates (fluconazole MIC 64 mg/l) from HIV-infected patients with OPC. Antifungal susceptibility testing of serial C. albicans isolates was performed by NCCLS methodology. Strain identity was investigated by DNA-typing techniques. Overexpression of genes encoding lanosterol 14-demethylase (erg11) and efflux transporters (mdr1 and cdr) implicated in the development of resistance was monitored in matched sets of susceptible and resistant isolates. In addition, erg11 genes were PCR-amplified and their nucleotide sequences determined in order to detect point mutations. A combination of different mechanisms of resistance contributed to the development of resistance to fluconazole. The multifactorial character of the azole resistance in C. albicans makes necessary the development of approaches to overcome the problem. Accordingly, new triazoles have been developed; new classes of antifungals are being investigated; and combinations with inhibitors of efflux transporters are being studied.
