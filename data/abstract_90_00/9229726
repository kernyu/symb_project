Candidiasis has increased its frequency over the last decade, particularly among hospitalized patients where it is accompanied with high rates of mortality, and in patients with AIDS who are predisposed to oropharyngeal or esophageal candidiasis. The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of appearance of different yeast species and the resistance profile to current antifungal drugs in hospitalized pediatric patients and adult HIV patients from 5 institutions of Buenos Aires City and suburbs, and La Plata City, during the period 1993-1995, in order to obtain local and updated information. Candida albicans was the etiologic agent recovered in 87% of the 214 HIV positive patients with oropharyngeal candidosis, and in 50% of the 209 hospitalized pediatric patients. In the latter group 28% of these infections were due to Candida parapsilosis and 18% to Candida tropicalis, but only 2% and 4% of oral candidosis were caused by these organisms. Detection of Malassezia furfur and Hansenula anomala, responsible of systemic infections, and Trichosporon beigelii, isolated from a burn patient, were considered remarkable since these organisms appear to be emerging pathogens. Azole resistant species as Candida krusei and C. glabrata were mostly recovered from HIV positive patients, exposed to fluconazole treatment. A very low number of amfotericin B "resistant" yeasts (n = 9) were observed in both groups. However, resistance to azole drugs, particularly to fluconazole, was found in pediatric patients (13%) and in HIV infected adults (34%).
