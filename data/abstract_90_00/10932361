Amylase hyper-producing, catabolite-repression-resistant, recombinant strains were produced by intraspecific protoplast fusion of thermophilic fungus Thermomyces lanuginosus strains, using well-characterized, morphological, and 2-deoxy-D-glucose resistant markers. The fusant heterokaryons exhibited enhanced amylase activities as compared to the amylase hyper-producing parental strain (T2). Diploids derived from heterokaryons segregated to stable haploid recombinant strains. In the haploid strain (Tlh 4q), approximately 5-fold higher specific activities of alpha-amylase and glucoamylase in the culture filtrate were observed as compared to the wild-type strain (W0).
