A 58.7-kb nonconjugative plasmid (pKQ1) previously reported in a clinical isolate of Enterococcus faecium was found to contain both a tetM and an erythromycin resistance (erm) determinant. The plasmid contained a region homologous to the A, F, H, and G HincII fragments of Tn916. However, the 4.8-kb B fragment of Tn916 which contained the tetM determinant was replaced by a 7.3-kb fragment, and the 3.6-kb HincII C fragment of Tn916 was missing. An element homologous to Tn917 was juxtaposed to the truncated Tn916-like element. The Tn917-like element was similar in size to the erm transposon Tn917 as determined by a ClaI restriction digest which spanned approximately 99% of the transposon. When Bacillus subtilis or Streptococcus sanguis were transformed with pKQ1, no zygotically induced transposition of the tetM element was detected. Similarly no transposition of the Tn917-like element was detected.
