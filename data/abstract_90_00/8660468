7-aminocholesterol has been described as being a strong inhibitor of yeast and of Gram+-bacteria proliferation. In order to determine the precise molecular target of the toxicity of this compound, we searched for yeast resistance linked to gene over-expression. We named the new yeast gene that was isolated RTA1 (EMBL X84736). This gene led to strong resistance to the inhibitor. Gene sequencing revealed that RTA1 is adjacent to the NAB1 gene which is orientated in an opposite direction and localized on chromosome VII. The RTA1 gene, which encodes a putative protein with seven potential membrane-spanning segments, was shown to be a non-essential gene in yeast.
