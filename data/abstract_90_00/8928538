We report on a 43-year-old female diabetic patient who was treated with ceftibuten because of Pseudomonas aeruginosa induced otitis externa. Thereafter she developed a prolonged seven-months-persisting irreversible cholestasis. Liver puncutre revealed a canalicular and hepatocellular cholestasis without liver cell necrosis or bile duct injury. After seven-months the patient died because of antibiotic-resistant Pseudomonas-septicemia.
