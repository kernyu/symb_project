Resistant strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae were found in increasing frequency as a cause of nosocomial infection in an intensive care unit between July and October 1990. The isolated strains had an almost identical biochemical profile, showed a similar pattern of antibiotic resistance, and produced type SHV2-broad-spectrum betalactamase. Thus, it was assumed that the isolates were copies of identical strains, causing an outbreak of nosocomial infections. The bacteria were resistant to third-generation cephalosporins, such as cefotiam, cefotaxime and ceftriaxone, and also to aminoglycosides and acylaminopenicillins. Approximately half of the strains were resistant to ceftazidim and aztreonam. The bacteria were sensitive in vitro to ciprofloxacin, imipenem, latamoxef and cefotetan. During three months, 10% (11) of all patients became infected; four of these patients (36%) died from septicemia. After conventional hygiene programs had failed to stop the outbreak, the intensive care unit was closed and disinfected, a measure, which effectively interrupted the infection.
