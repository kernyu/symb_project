Active targeting of doxorubicin to macrophages was studied by incorporating it in mannose-coated liposomes by use of visceral leishmaniasis in BALB/c mice as the model macrophage disease. Mannosylated liposomal doxorubicin was more effective than liposomal doxorubicin or free doxorubicin. Because leishmaniasis is accompanied by immunosuppression, immunostimulation by interferon (IFN)-gamma was evaluated to act synergistically with mannosylated liposomal doxorubicin therapy. Combination chemotherapy with a suboptimal dose of IFN-gamma resulted in possibly complete elimination of spleen parasite burden. Analysis of mRNA levels of infected spleen cells suggested that targeted drug treatment together with IFN-gamma, in addition to greatly reducing parasite numbers, resulted in reduced levels of interleukin (IL)-4 but increased levels of IL-12 and inducible nitric oxide synthase. Such combination chemotherapy may provide a promising alternative for the cure of leishmaniasis, with a plausible conversion of antiparasitic T cell response from a Th2 to Th1 pattern indicative of long-term resistance.
