Self-mobilization of large plasmids was not observed in 15 of 15 strains of gentamicin-resistant (Gmr) Staphylococcus epidermidis clinical isolates that were taken from bacteremic newborns in a neonatal intensive care unit. Alternatively, nine Gmr Staphylococcus aureus clinical isolates, which were isolated along with the S. epidermidis strains, were all shown previously to contain Gmr conjugative plasmids. All of the nonconjugative strains had plasmids that were similar in size to the S. aureus conjugative plasmids. Transfer of seven of these nonconjugative plasmids by protoplast transformation indicated that they carried Gmr determinants. The rationale of these studies was to detect the presence of genes for conjugation (tra) on the large Gmr nonconjugative plasmids. It was thought that these plasmids might contain either defective or deleted tra gene sequences. To gain insight into these possibilities, a 6.3-kb probe, which contained a major tra gene region, was hybridized with EcoRI and XbaI digests of nonconjugative plasmid DNA. Hybridization occurred with only one of eight plasmids. It was concluded that seven of the large S. epidermidis plasmids were not self-transmissible because they lacked tra genes. However, pMH6502 contained an excess of tra gene regions compared to prototype conjugative plasmids and was still not self-transmissible.
