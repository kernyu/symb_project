The efficacy of a mixture of albendazole sulphoxide and levamisole, 3.6 and 8.25 mg/kg respectively, at single and double dose rates, was compared with the recommended dose rate of each anthelmintic alone. The comparison was conducted on groups of 6 to 14-week-old lambs on 22 farms, 16 of which had evidence of multiple resistance to benzimidazole and levamisole. A single dose of the mixture reduced mean egg counts by 95% on half the farms with multiple resistance and on all the remaining farms. Consequently, the mixture should be included in an assessment of effective anthelmintics on farms to determine its value for nematode control. A double dose rate of mixture was effective on all but 4 farms. Reductions caused by the mixture were due to the additive actions of the drugs on 18 of 22 farms; synergistic action was noted on only 3 farms. It was concluded that the mixture of albendazole sulphoxide and levamisole offered many farmers an effective anthelmintic for use in preventive control programs. Recommendations for such programs include annual rotation of effective anthelmintics as a means of delaying selection for drug resistance.
