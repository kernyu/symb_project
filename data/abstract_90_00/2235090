Norfloxacin is a synthetic antibiotic belonging to the fluoroquinolone class. At present, an oral formulation is available and indicated for the treatment of urinary tract infections. Because of the properties of norfloxacin, a 0.3% norfloxacin ophtalmic solution may be used by ophtalmologists. The molecular target of norfloxacin is DNA gyrase that regulates DNA replication. Norfloxacin is a broad spectrum antibiotic. A flurin atome in position 6 is responsible for the broad spectrum of activity as compared with the first generation quinolones. MICs of norfloxacin against Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterbacteriaceae are low or intermediate. Norfloxacin is a bactericidal drug of which MBCs are equivalent to or twice as high as MICs against the majority of organisms. The proportion of norfloxacin resistant strains is limited and, at present, no plasmid resistance has been observed. This explains the activity of norfloxacin against clinical isolates whose drug resistance is plasmid-mediated. Norfloxacin resistance is chromosomic, but the mutation rate is low. There is no cross-resistance between quinolones and other classes of drug, with the exception of drug resistance related to changes in the bacterial outer membrane proteins. A low decrease in norfloxacin susceptibility is observed in case of resistance to first generation quinolones. The above-mentioned properties make norfloxacin in ophtalmic solution a first line drug for treatment of superficial ocular infections and a second line drug for treatment of infections due to organisms resistant to other drugs.
