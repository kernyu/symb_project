Five Plesiomonas shigelloides strains isolated from retail or wild-catch Louisiana blue crabs (Callinectes sapidus) were examined for resistance to selected antibiotics and presence of plasmids. Three agar media, MacConkey, Salmonella-Shigella and a modification of inositol brilliant green bile salt (IBB), were evaluated for isolation of P. shigelloides. Of these, IBB was most satisfactory for distinguishing between P. shigelloides and the related species Aeromonas hydrophila. Isolates were susceptible to gentamicin, nalidixic acid and tetracycline, and were resistant to ampicillin, carbenicillin, kanamycin and streptomycin. Each isolate carried three plasmids of approximately 2.5 kb, 3.8 kb and 5.3 kb. Plasmid curing with ethidium bromide and elevated temperature linked the streptomycin resistance determinant with the 3.8 kb and/or 5.3 kb plasmids. These results provide the first description of small size plasmids in P. shigelloides. Identical antibiotic resistance patterns of the isolates indicated they share a common environment and likely share a common mode for developing antibiotic resistance. Furthermore, emergence of antibiotic-resistant P. shigelloides may imply contamination of Louisiana aquatic environments by wastewater.
