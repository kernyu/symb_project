Differential display techniques were used to isolate cDNA clones corresponding to genes which were expressed in soybean hypocotyls by Phytophthora sojae f.sp. glycines infection. With a partial cDNA clone C20CI4 from the differential display PCR as a probe, a new basic peroxidase cDNA clone, designated GMIPER1, was isolated from a cDNA library of soybean hypocotyls infected with P. sojae f.sp. glycines. Sequence analysis revealed that the peroxidase clone encodes a mature protein of 35,813 Da with a putative signal peptide of 27 amino acids in its N-terminus. The amino acid sequence of the soybean peroxidase GMIPER1 is between 54-75% identical to other plant peroxidases including a soybean seed coat peroxidase. Southern blot analysis indicated that multiple copies of sequences related to GMIPER1 exist in the soybean genome. The mRNAs corresponding to the GMIPER1 cDNA accumulated predominantly in the soybean hypocotyls infected with the incompatible race of P. sojae f.sp. glycines, but were expressed at low levels in the compatible interaction. Soybean GMIPER1 mRNAs were not expressed in hypocotyls, leaves, stems, and roots of soybean seedlings. However, treatments with ethephon, salicylic acid or methyl jasmonate induced the accumulation of the GMIPER1 mRNAs in the different organs of soybean. These results suggest that the GMIPER1 gene encoding a putative pathogen-induced peroxidase may play an important role in induced resistance of soybean to P. sojae f.sp. glycines and in response to various external stresses.
