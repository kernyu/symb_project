From 1986 to 1990 we have treated 215 patients with falciparum malaria. In 8 patients (4%) who had not returned to any malarial area, malaria attacks recurred after 6-20 weeks. Curiously these were now caused by different species: Plasmodium vivax (4 patients) and P. ovale (4 patients). After proper management of malignant tertian malaria caused by P. falciparum, patients are considered cured, provided the treatment has been in accordance with the resistance pattern of the parasite in the country of origin. Yet, in a small number of patients attacks of malaria recur after different time intervals. The explanation of this seemingly paradoxical phenomenon is that these were delayed primary attacks of benign tertian malaria rather than recrudescences of malignant tertian malaria. Consequently the patients must have been infected by two different species of malaria at a time. In P. vivax and P. ovale hypnozoites occur (notably absent in P. falciparum), dormant stages in the liver that are not susceptible to the antimalarials in use for the eradication or prophylaxis of the blood stages which cause the acute attacks of malaria. After a variable amount of time the blood is then (re)invaded and the patient suffers a delayed primary attack or a relapse. Physicians should be aware that definite cure of malignant tertian malaria does not prevent future attacks of benign tertian malaria. They should inform their patients accordingly.
