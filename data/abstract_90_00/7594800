In vitro antibacterial activity of balofloxacin (BLFX), a newly developed fluoroquinoline, was compared with that of norfloxacin (NFLX), ofloxacin (OFLX) and ciplofloxacin (CPFX). Bacterial strains used in this experiment were freshly isolated from patients with infectious enteritis just before BLFX therapy. The isolates were 43 strains of Vibrio cholerae O1, 1 strain of Campylobacter sp., 4 strains of Aeromonas spp., 3 strains of Plesiomonas shigelloides, 1 strain of Vibrio mimicus and 1 strain of Vibrio cholerae non-O1. MIC90 of BLFX against 43 strains of Shigella spp., 13 strains of Salmonella spp. and 9 strains of E. coli were 0.39, 0.39, 0.2 micrograms/ml, respectively. All strains of Aeromonas spp. and P. Shigelloides were inhibited by the concentrations under 0.39 and 0.05 micrograms/ml. MIC90 of BLFX, NFLX, OFLX and CPFX against a total of 79 strains were 0.39, 0.2, 0.2 and 0.05 micrograms/ml, respectively.
