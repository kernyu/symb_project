Herpes simplex viruses (HSV) 1 and 2 are responsible for genital herpes which is usually recognized as vesicles that ulcerate and eventually heal but recur periodically. Atypical genital herpes is often described in immunocompromised patients and can present as large, chronic, hyperkeratotic ulcers. Acyclovir-resistant HSV is occasionally isolated from such ulcers. Most cases of HSV infection reproduce subtle signs and symptoms, or more commonly, asymptomatic viral shedding. Such subclinical presentations may be responsible for most of the 30% increase in the prevalence of genital herpes in the United States during the past two decades.
