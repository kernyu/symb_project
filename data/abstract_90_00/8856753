Antibiotic resistance in the neonatal and pediatric intensive care environments has not been rigorously investigated. There is reason to believe that the epidemiology of antibiotic resistance in these settings may be different from that in other hospital settings because the patients' preadmission health status, the maturity of their immune systems, and their outpatient exposure to antibiotics are different from those seen in adults. At the present time, the areas of greatest concern are the outbreaks of infection caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in the neonatal ICUs and the emergence of antibiotic-resistant Gram-negative bacteria in pediatric intensive care units (PICU). In the former, colonization and transmission by nursery personnel remains one of the great challenges in infection control. In the latter, new information is emerging which challenges the notion that antibiotic-restriction policies might be an effective means for modulating the emergence of antibiotic-resistant Gram-negative pathogens in the pediatric intensive care environment. It appears that these organisms are largely imported into the ICU from the community and are not a result of antibiotic practices within the unit itself. This observation requires that strategies to control these organisms in the PICU be reassessed.
