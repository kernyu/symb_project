BACKGROUND: Respiratory pathogens are becoming increasingly resistant to antimicrobials. A new group of drugs, called respiratory quinolones have been synthesized to overcome this problem. AIM: To study the in vitro susceptibility of respiratory pathogens to old and new antimicrobials. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty five strains of S pneumoniae, 44 strains of H influenzae, 21 strains of M catarrhalis, 10 strains of methicillin susceptible S aureus and 20 strains of methicillin resistant S aureus were studied. All were isolated from community acquired respiratory infections during 1999. Minimal inhibitory concentrations of moxifloxacin, amoxicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, clarithromycin, azithromycin, ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin were determined using the Etest method. Beta-lactamase production by H influenzae and M catarrhalis was also studied. RESULTS: S pneumoniae strains were 100% susceptible to quinolones and cotrimoxazole, 2% were resistant to macrolides, 11% were resistant to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and 47% were resistant to cefuroxime. H influenzae was 100% susceptible to quinolones, azithromycin and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. There was a 53% resistance to cotrimoxazole, 21% to amoxicillin, 9% to clarithromycin and 7% to cefuroxime. M catarrahalis was 100% susceptible to quinolones and 100% resistant to amoxicillin, 5% resistant to macrolides, 14% resistant to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, 20% to cefuroxime and 30% to cotrimoxazole. Methicillin susceptible S aureus was susceptible to all antimicrobials and methicillin resistant S aureus was resistant to all. CONCLUSIONS: Maxifloxacin and the new respiratory quinolones can be useful in the treatment of respiratory infections.
