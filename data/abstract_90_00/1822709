Scedosporium inflatum is a newly described human pathogen, their infections primarily involved musculoskeletal tissues. We report 2 fatal cases with disseminated S. inflatum infections in Spanish patients. The fungus was isolated from blood in both cases. Amphotericin B treatment was ineffective. In vitro susceptibility testing of one isolate against 7 antifungal agents is done. These cases illustrate the need to remain vigilant for this new emerging pathogen.
