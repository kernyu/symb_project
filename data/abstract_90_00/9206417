Rubber dam clamps are known to break during clinical use in endodontics. This in-vitro study examined some of the variables which may contribute to the fracture. Stainless steel rubber dam clamps were subjected to various cleaning and autoclaving regimes and exposure to various solutions of sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl). Each clamp was examined after four cycles of cleaning and exposure to NaOCl. During environmental exposure to NaOCl, the clamp was stressed over a perspex rod to simulate placement onto the crown of a tooth. Clamps were examined after each test cycle visually and microscopically, or immediately after breakage. Results suggested that the fractures were because of a stress corrosion cracking phenomenon. There was evidence of intergranular and transgranular cracking of the metal. Corrosion spots were seen on the surface of the clamps and fracture occurred mainly through these spots. A number of recommendations to reduce breakage of clamps have been suggested.
