PURPOSE: To treat a case of Ochrobactrum anthropi endophthalmitis after uneventful cataract surgery. METHODS: A 66-year-old patient in good general health underwent uncomplicated cataract surgery in his right eye. Seven weeks later, pars plana vitrectomy with removal of the intraocular lens became necessary because of progressive low-grade endophthalmitis resistant to topical and systemic erythromycin, cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, and colistin. RESULTS: Microbiologic examination of the vitreous biopsy, capsule, and anterior chamber fluid disclosed O. anthropi, a nonfermentative gram-negative bacillus sensitive to imipenem, amikacin, ciprofloxacin, and vancomycin. CONCLUSION: Ochrobactrum anthropi and its natural resistance against many antibiotics should be considered in the treatment of low-grade endophthalmitis after uneventful cataract surgery.
