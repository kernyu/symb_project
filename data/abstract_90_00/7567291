To determine the risk for diarrheal disease (DD) in day-care centers (DCC) for children residing in a poor urban slum area of Quito, Ecuador, compared with that for children from the same environment but cared for in their own residential home (RH), a prospective age-, sex- and locale-controlled study of DD was conducted, including 115 children in DCC and 115 in RH, ages 12 to 42 months. The overall incidence of DD was 46/1000 child weeks. Diarrhea was more common in DCC than in RH (relative risk (RR), 1.75; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.38 to 2.22; P < 0.001). Poor hygienic practices were more prevalent in DCC than in RH. The use of reused water for child handwashing before eating and for washing raw vegetables was associated with a higher risk of DD in DCC than in RH (RR = 4.08, CI 2.93 to 5.67, P < 0.001; RR = 3.90, CI 2.79 to 5.44, P < 0.001, respectively). These two practices were risk factors in the DCC (RR = 2.74, CI 2.08 to 3.68, P < 0.001; RR = 2.05, CI 1.55 to 2.71, P < 0.001, respectively) when compared with their absence in the same DCC. Shigella (RR = 3.58, CI 1.19 to 10.78, P < 0.02), Aeromonas (RR = 10.47, CI 1.35 to 81.05, P < 0.01), rotavirus (RR = 2.86, CI 1.87 to 4.39, P < 0.001) and Giardia (RR = 1.59, CI 1.00 to 2.59, P < 0.05) were more common in DCC than in RH. More than two-fifths of the Shigella and Aeromonas isolates were resistant to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
