The activity of imipenem against Pseudomonas aeruginosa HUS-3 decreased by 16 times in the presence of substances eluted from siliconized latex urinary catheters (SLUCs). SLUCs did not inactivate imipenem or increase beta-lactamase activity. The outer membrane of P. aeruginosa HUS-3 grown in the presence of eluate lacked an OprD-like protein and expressed a new 50-kDa protein. The decreased activity of imipenem against P. aeruginosa in the presence of SLUCs is related to the loss of an OprD-like protein and the expression of a new outer membrane protein.
