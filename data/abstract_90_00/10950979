Previous studies have shown that infection of human fibroblasts with human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) results in activation of cellular interferon-responsive gene expression. We demonstrate here that infection of human fibroblasts with herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) in the absence of de novo protein synthesis also induces the expression of interferon-responsive genes. Five genes tested (encoding ISG54, IFI56, ISG15, 9-27 and MxA) were activated by infection with HSV-1, although the degree of response varied between the individual genes. HSV-1 was a less efficient inducer than HCMV. The effect was a consequence of binding of the virus particle to the cell surface or of the presence of virion components within the infected cell. Induction was mediated by a pathway other than the mechanism through which interferon-alpha mediates its effects on cellular gene expression.
