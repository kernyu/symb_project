OBJECTIVES: The increased risk for systemic fungal infection and the potential fatal consequences of disseminated candidiasis in bone marrow transplant patients has prompted study of prophylaxis and early treatment of candida colonization and infection. STUDY DESIGN: Patients with leukemia who received fluconazole prophylaxis were compared with a concurrent group of patients not given prophylaxis for fungal organisms. RESULTS: A trend to reduction of oropharyngeal colonization by Candida albicans was seen (p = 0.07) although no significant differences in systemic candidiasis were seen. In patients with documented systemic candidiasis, oral colonization was present and systemic infection was identified after the development of ulcerative oral mucositis. CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the potential of fluconazole to reduce oropharyngeal colonization by Candida albicans, however, we did not show prophylaxis of oral candidiasis or systemic candidiasis. These findings and reports of fluconazole-resistant candidal species and a rising number of cases of infection as a result of Candida krusei indicate the need for further studies of prophylaxis of candidal infection in patients who are anticipated to develop profound neutropenia.
