The in vitro susceptibility of chloroquine and the genomic profile of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) codon 108 was determined against african isolates of P. falciparum (Pf) from imported malaria cases without previous drug intake by an isotopic microtest or PCR + RFLP. Pf resistance to chloroquine or to the DHFR inhibitor was present in 49% and 46% of isolates, respectively. Pf drug resistance was more frequent in permanent than in seasonal malarial transmission areas and chloroquine plus DHFR resistance reached 28% in years 1995-97. Updating the guidelines for the prevention of malaria in travellers to Africa is necessary.
