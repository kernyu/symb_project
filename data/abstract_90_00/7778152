Plasmodium falciparum in Thailand is highly resistant to chloroquine and sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine and there is increasing resistance to the alternative antimalarials, quinine and mefloquine. In eastern Thailand, the cure rates of mefloquine at 750 and 1250 mg were 30% and 55%, respectively. The use of drug combinations may be necessary in areas where drug-resistant parasites exist. 159 male Thai patients in Chantaburi, eastern Thailand, were allocated at random to receive either oral artemether at a single dose of 300 mg on the first day followed by mefloquine 750 mg at 24 h and 500 mg at 30 h (group A), or oral artemether at a single dose of 300 mg on the first day, mefloquine 750 mg at 24 h and placebo at 30 h (group B). The follow-up was on days 1, 2, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35 and 42. Most patients in both groups had a rapid initial response to treatment, parasitaemia being cleared within 24 h and fever cleared within 48 h in both groups. The cure rates were 97% and 90%, respectively, for groups A and B. No serious adverse effect was seen in either group; mild and transient nausea, vomiting and loss of appetite were noted. The adverse effects did not differ between the 2 groups. The results suggested that a single oral dose of artemether (300 mg) can markedly improve the cure rate of mefloquine at a dose of 750 or 1250 mg in multiple drug-resistant falciparum malaria.
