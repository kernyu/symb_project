We have isolated and characterized mutants of Borrelia burgdorferi that are resistant to the antibiotic coumermycin A1, which targets the B subunit of DNA gyrase. Mutants had either 100- or 300-fold higher resistance to coumermycin A1 than wild-type B. burgdorferi. In each case, a single point mutation in the gyrB gene converted Arg-133 to Gly or Ile. Mutations in the homologous Arg residue of Escherichia coli DNA gyrase are also associated with resistance to coumarin antimicrobial agents.
