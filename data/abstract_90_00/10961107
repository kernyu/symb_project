Antagonistic activity of lactic acid bacteria of strain N 2585 of "Maxilin" probiotic in respect to the strains S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, E. coli, Candida albicans and their effect on the level of sustainability of the antibiotic resistant strains S. aureus, E. coli, P. aeruginosa, which are extracted from the patients with open fractures of the mandible under various course of wound process, have been studied. The studies showed that lactic acid bacteria have suppressed growth of strains Candida most actively, followed by P. aeruginosa, S. aureus and E. coli. The use of "Maxilin" probiotic allowed reducing the epidemiological significance of pathogenetic strains already in 3 to 4 days. The sensibility studies showed high activity of the lactic acid bacteria in reducing antibiotic resistance of the strains investigated. It was revealed that "Maxilin" probiotic affects Ps. aeruginosa effectively, somewhat less St. aureus and E. coli. The extracted strains demonstrated sensibility to all investigated antibiotics already in 3 to 4 days.
