The primary objective of the MYSTIC study is to monitor the performance of meropenem over a period of at least 3 years during which this carbapenem is prescribed in different hospital units thus allowing profiles to be established within individual hospitals. Monitoring is being carried out by assessing the antibiotic susceptibility of bacterial pathogens isolated from patients with a predominate problem of intraabdominal infections (IAI) and/or lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI), treated in specialist centres (haematology wards, the Intensive Care Unit [ICU], cystic fibrosis units) and non-specialised centres. Samples will be collected over each year and tested against meropenem and a set of comparators. The data obtained from the first year of the study (1997) come from 33 centres spread mainly throughout Europe but also in Israel and Mexico. The results shows that meropenem retains its broad spectrum and potency whilst there is evidence that the activity of comparator antibiotics is being eroded by a variety of resistance mechanisms. Data from subsequent years of the programme will determine whether these trends continue and will allow a series of individual centre profiles to be compiled and presented.
