We have developed a new molecular tool for the diagnosis of the benzimidazole (BZ)-susceptibility or resistance in Teladorsagia circumcincta a nematode parasite of small ruminants. This tool is based on the use of the PCR and allows the genotyping of resistant (rr) or susceptible (rS and SS) adult worms or larvae. By using four primers in the same reaction mixture, worms can be genotyped in regard to the mutation on the residue 200 (phenylalanine to tyrosine) of the beta-tubulin which is implicated in BZ resistance. A very high proportion of homozygous SS (Phe/Phe) individuals characterized the BZ susceptible populations, whereas a variable proportion of homozygous rr (Tyr/Tyr) individuals characterized the BZ resistant populations. A positive correlation was observed between the LD50 estimated by egg hatch assay, and the proportion of mutant homozygous individuals rr (Tyr/Tyr). Our PCR method allows the rapid genotyping of numerous worms and permits the detection of the first resistant individuals in a worm population.
