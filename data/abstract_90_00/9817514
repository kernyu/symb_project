We investigated the use, treatment results and safety of ciprofloxacin in the treatment of childhood typhoid and paratyphoid infections in an industrialized country. The study was retrospective, and the material consisted of children admitted to Hvidovre or Glostrup University Hospitals from 1991 to 1995, and treated with ciprofloxacin for a culture proven diagnosis of typhoid fever. 21 children were included, 18 had positive cultures for Salmonella typhi and 3 had positive cultures for S. paratyphi A. All isolates were fully susceptible to ciprofloxacin. The median duration of treatment was 10 d, median oral dose was 24 mg/kg/d and the median intravenous dose was 15 mg/kg/d. Within 4 d after start of treatment all subjects had a normal body temperature. No subjects had clinical or microbiological relapse and all stool cultures after end of treatment were negative. Adverse events were rare, but in 2 children a transient limb/ataxia or a period of confusion were recorded. Both children recovered within a few days without sequelae. We conclude that ciprofloxacin was effective and well tolerated for treatment of typhoid fever in children. The few adverse events that were recorded left no permanent sequelae, and were likely to be caused by the disease itself.
