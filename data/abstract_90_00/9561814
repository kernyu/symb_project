The increased resistance of bacteria to antimicrobial agents poses major therapeutic problems for the treatment of patients hospitalized in critical care units. This article discusses the mechanisms of resistance and the basic rationale for the treatment of infected patients. The authors also discuss methods used to control the dissemination of resistant bacteria from patient to patient, the complex problems of colonization, and the strategies used to delay the emergence of resistance to new antibiotics.
