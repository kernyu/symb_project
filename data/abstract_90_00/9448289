Murine polyoma virus (MPyV) is a small DNA virus that induces tumors in multiple tissues of infected host. In this investigation, we show that cell lines derived from wild type virus-induced breast tumors are resistant to the growth inhibitory action of interferon beta (IFN-beta). Furthermore, replication of heterologous viruses such as vesicular stomatitis virus and encephalomyocarditis virus was not inhibited by IFN-beta in these cells. This effect was due to inhibition of IFN-stimulated gene expression by viral T antigen. Activation of IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 was inhibited in cells derived from a tumor induced by wild-type MPyV but not those from a mutant that lacks the pRB binding site of the large T antigen. Similarly IFN-gamma-inducible gene expression was also inhibited in cells transformed by wild-type virus. The levels of components of IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 and signal transducing Janus tyrosine kinases were comparable between the cells transformed by the wild-type and mutant viruses. The viral large T antigen bound to Janus tyrosine kinase 1 and inactivated signaling through IFN receptors. Thus, these studies identify a mechanism of viral resistance to IFN action.
