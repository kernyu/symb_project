t,t-Muconaldehyde and t,t-muconic acid have been investigated for the induction of gene mutations in Salmonella typhimurium (reversion of the his- strains TA97, TA98, TA100, TA102, TA104 and TA1535), Escherichia coli (reversion of the trp- strain WP2 uvrA) and Chinese hamster V79 cells (acquisition of resistance toward 6-thioguanine). t,t-Muconaldehyde proved weakly mutagenic in strain TA104 in the presence and absence of NADPH-fortified postmitochondrial fraction from rat liver homogenate (S9 mix). In strains TA97, TA100 and TA102, weak positive responses were observed only in the presence of S9 mix. In strains TA98, TA1535 and WP2 uvrA, the result was negative. In V79 cells, the mutation frequency was increased from approximately 7 X 10(-6) to 90 X 10(-6) in cultures exposed to t,t-muconaldehyde at optimal concentration (1.7-3 microM in separate experiments). The concentration-response curve showed pronounced hyperlinearity, with no mutagenic effect being observed at a third of the optimal concentration. t,t-Muconic acid was greater than 100 times less toxic than t,t-muconaldehyde in both bacteria and mammalian cells, and it did not show any mutagenic effect. These results complete a previous mutagenicity study, carried out on benzene and 13 metabolites. It is concluded that the newly investigated metabolites cannot account for the bacterial mutagenicity of bioactivated benzene and benzene-trans-1,2-dihydrodiol, since these compounds exhibited their strongest response in strain TA1535. t,t-Muconaldehyde showed similarities in its mutagenicity to p-benzoquinone and hydroquinone. All three compounds showed, at most, weak effects in bacteria, but were strongly mutagenic in V79 cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
