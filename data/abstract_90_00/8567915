Multilocus enzyme electrophoresis and in vitro susceptibility testing with a broth microdilution method were used to analyze Candida albicans strain diversity in four AIDS patients with recurrent oropharyngeal candidiasis who successively developed clinical resistance to fluconazole (FCZ) and itraconazole (ITZ). One to ten colonies per sample were randomly chosen from oral washings collected before the initial FCZ treatment and just before every other antifungal treatment; a total of 98 isolates were analyzed. Multilocus enzyme electrophoresis analysis revealed 14 different electrophoretic types (ETs). Statistical analysis of genetic distances showed that C. albicans isolates clustered into five subpopulations (I to V). In each subpopulation, isolates are closely related, and genetic distances between subpopulations I to IV are short. In contrast, subpopulation V, which contained isolates typed as ET8 and ET14, is strongly divergent from the others; these isolates may represent atypical C. albicans isolates. Only one patient was infected with a single strain during the course of azole therapy; for the three remaining patients, variants of the same strain and different strains were concurrently isolated. Clinical FCZ resistance was clearly correlated with in vitro data for three patients. Moreover, MICs of ITZ increased during FCZ therapy, and MICs of ITZ which were > or = 1.56 micrograms/ml were found when clinical ITZ resistance occurred; isolates from subpopulation V showed the highest MICs of ITZ. Because of the emergence of clinical ITZ resistance after clinical FCZ resistance, the feasibility of long-term azole therapy for mucosal candidiasis in AIDS patients is questioned.
