Chlorpromazine and thioridazine are phenothiazines employed in the treatment of psychosis. These agents inhibited the respiration of clinical isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis resistant to streptomycin, rifampin, isoniazid, ethambutol and/or pyrazinamid, all first line drugs. Since any adverse reaction to thioridazine is generally less severe than to chlorpromazine, the possibility is attractive that thioridazine may have a potential in the initial management of patients with newly diagnosed tuberculosis with an as yet undetermined antibiotic susceptibility profile.
