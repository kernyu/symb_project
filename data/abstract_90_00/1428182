Fecal samples of 310 healthy persons, from two populations from different areas in the Netherlands, were examined for the presence of Escherichia coli resistant to ampicillin, tetracycline, sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim and nitrofurantoin. High prevalences of resistance were found in both populations, ranging from 28% for trimethoprim to 89% for ampicillin. The percentages of the fecal samples with a dominantly resistant E. coli flora (> 50% resistance) were distinctly lower, ranging from 1% for nitrofurantoin to 21% for tetracycline. No significant differences in the level of resistance were observed between these two comparable populations in two different areas. The susceptibilities to 11 antimicrobial agents of 456 at random isolated E. coli were determined. The percentages of resistance varied widely: from 80% for chloramphenicol to 9% for nitrofurantoin. Only 19% of the isolates were susceptible to all antibiotics tested and 14% were resistant to more than four of the agents tested. Great differences in resistance rates between the two populations examined were seen for chloramphenicol (80% to 41%) and trimethoprim (16% to 36%). The results of this study underscore the presence of a human reservoir of antibiotic resistant microorganisms.
