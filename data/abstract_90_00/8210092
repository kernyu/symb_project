The animal model of acute otitis media (AOM) has been widely used to study the pathophysiology and treatment of this disease. Different authors have demonstrated a both mechanic and immunologic role of concomitant viral infection in the pathogenesis of AOM. The specific immune response was found mainly local in otitis media due to S. pneumoniae and systemic with H. influenzae. Local and systemic complications are currently precise. This model was proved useful in pre-clinical evaluation of antimicrobial agents and development of vaccines.
