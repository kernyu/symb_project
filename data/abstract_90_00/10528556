The practice of using antibiotics to treat and control microbial infections is a little more than 50 years old. Widespread administration of multiple classes of antibiotics over the years has had the unfortunate secondary effect of inducing the emergence of an increasing array of drug-resistant microbial strains. This article will discuss the evolution of certain forms of antibiotic resistance, as well as the mechanisms by which bacteria render numerous antimicrobials ineffective. Special emphasis is placed on emerging issues relating to organisms making up portions of the normal oral microflora.
