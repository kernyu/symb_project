Programmed cell death occurs in the inner cell mass during blastulation concomitant with the loss of its trophectodermal potential, and blastocele fluid kills malignant inner cell mass cells with trophectodermal potential (ECa 247) but spares those with embryonic potential (P19). A previous study had shown that blastocele-like fluid from embryoid bodies of the teratocarcinoma C44 contains a low-molecular-weight cytotoxin that exhibits the same target-cell selectivity as normal blastocele fluid. The current paper shows that the preferential killing of cells with trophectodermal potential is caused by hydrogen peroxide generated during the oxidation of polyamines in the cyst fluid by amine oxidases. The greater resistance of cells with embryonic potential to hydrogen peroxide is due to glutathione-dependent mechanisms. These data lead to the conclusion that an amine oxidase in the blastocyst oxidizes polyamines in blastocele fluid, generating hydrogen peroxide which causes programmed cell death of normal and malignant cells with trophectodermal potential.
