We determined the MICs of 28 antimicrobial agents against 36 clinical strains of Pediococcus spp. (25 P. acidilactici, 9 P. pentosaceus, and 2 P. urinaeequi strains). Penicillin G, imipenem, gentamicin, netilmicin, erythromycin, clindamycin, rifampin, chloramphenicol, daptomycin, and ramoplanin were the most active. All strains of P. acidilactici were susceptible to novobiocin, whereas all isolates of P. pentosaceus were resistant. Novobiocin could therefore be helpful for differentiation of these two closely related species. P. acidilactici HM3020 was inducibly resistant to macrolide, lincosamide, and streptogramin B-type (MLS) antibiotics. Resistance was due to a determinant homologous to ermAM and carried by a nontransferable 46-kb plasmid, pVM20. This plasmid was structurally distinct from two enterococcal MLS resistance plasmids, pIP819 and pAM beta 1. The 34 strains of P. acidilactici and P. pentosaceus were resistant to tetracycline, and total DNA of these strains did not hybridize to probes specific for tetK, tetL, tetM, and tetO.
