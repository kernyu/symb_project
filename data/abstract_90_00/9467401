Porphyromonas endodontalis forms dark colonies on media containing blood. We isolated, from an infected root canal, a non-black-pigmented P. endodontalis variant, KSEW01, which forms beige colonies on blood agar media. To characterize this variant, we compared its properties with those of two black-pigmented P. endodontalis strains, ATCC35406 and KSE105. Strain KSEW01 had a gelatinase activity comparable to that of the pigmented strains. Cell lysates of these three strains resolved by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis showed similar protein patterns. Quantitative DNA-DNA hybridization experiments indicated high homology between the nonpigmented strain KSEW01 and the two dark-pigmented strains. From these results, we identified strain KSEW01 as a P. endodontalis nonpigmented variant. DNA restriction endonuclease analysis indicated that the variant was closely related to a pigmented strain, KSE105. In contrast to the pigmented strains, strain KSEW01 did not degrade hemoglobin and formed no vesicles when cultured in the presence of blood. The susceptibilities of these three strains to 22 antibiotics were similar except for vancomycin. The nonpigmented variant was the most resistant to vancomycin (MIC: ATCC35406, 6.25 micrograms/ml; KSE105,12.5 micrograms/ml; KSEW01, 100 micrograms/ml). Overall, a relationship may exist between the presence of black-pigmentation and outer membrane systems of P. endodontalis.
