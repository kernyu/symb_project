OBJECTIVE: To study the in vitro effect of cord blood plasma(CBP) on the sensitivity of acute myeloid leukemia(AML) cells to cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C). METHODS: Cytotoxicity of Ara-C was detected by MTT assay in twenty-eight patients. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The sensitivity of AML cells to Ara-C was heterogeneous, but CBP could significantly enhanced the cytotoxic activity of Ara-C to drug resistant AML cells.
