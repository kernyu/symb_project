Studies in a band of ponies harboring Population S benzimidazole-resistant small strongyles were initiated in 1974 and have continued for 18 years. Treatment (bimonthly) was with cambendazole for the first 4 years and with oxibendazole (OBZ) for the next 14 years. Data on the first 10 years have been published. The present investigation includes the last 8 years (4 October 1984-11 September 1992), which are the seventh through fourteenth years, of treatment with OBZ. Pre- and posttreatment mean counts of strongyle eggs (epg) and larvae (lpg) per gram of feces were determined biweekly during the current study to monitor the efficacy of OBZ. The average annual percent reductions of epg counts effected by OBZ treatments were 51%, 53%, 38%, 38%, 39%, 28%, 40%, and 19% for the seventh through fourteenth years, respectively. Similar levels of reductions were observed for lpg counts. Although OBZ was initially highly effective on this population of small strongyles, epg and lpg counts gradually declined, but have remained more or less constant since the fifth year of research. However, reductions of the counts were the lowest for the last year of the study.
