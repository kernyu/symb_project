Information from the National Salmonella Shigella Center (NSSC), Thailand indicated that the most frequently isolated Salmonella serotype from humans during 1974-1975 was Salmonella typhi (33.1%), during 1976-1982 was S. krefeld (26.6%) and during 1983-1987 was S. derby (12.6%). Antimicrobial susceptibility study of various Salmonella serotypes indicated that S. krefeld was the serotype with multiple drug resistance persisting for the longest period of time. Human salmonellosis due to S. krefeld is very rare. During 1976-1978, a large outbreak of S. krefeld gastroenteritis occurred in Thailand, mainly in children. The outbreak spread countrywide and is currently endemic. Gastrointestinal symptoms are severe in young infants. Systemic invasion with bacteremia, meningitis and pneumonitis were reported. The antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of isolates varied from sensitive to multiply drug resistant. The common antibiotic resistances were to ampicillin (75-92%), chloramphenicol (33-75%), kanamycin (67-90%) and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (15-52%). Resistance to gentamicin and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim declined after the period of the epidemic. Antimicrobial resistance patterns of 150 S. krefeld strains isolated in Thailand during 1978-1987 showed multiple drug resistance with up to seven drugs. The most common patterns were ApCmKmSuTp and ApCmKmSmSuTc.
