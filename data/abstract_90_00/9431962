The sporadic emergence of Klebsiella pneumoniae strains resistant to cefepime and cefpirome was observed in Greek hospitals during 1996. Examination of six epidemiologically distinct strains and clones selected in vitro provided indications that resistance is due to the cooperation of decreased outer membrane permeability and hydrolysis of the cephalosporins by SHV-5 beta-lactamase, which was produced in large amounts.
