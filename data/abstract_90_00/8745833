The management of urinary tract infection in children must take into account several factors, namely the type of bacteria, the localization of the infection, the presence of an uropathy and the age of the patient. In acute pyelonephritis, the risk of renal scarring justifies a first line treatment with two antibiotics to be administrated intravenously in newborns and infants. Treatment must be maintained for at least 10 days: double antibiotherapy for 4-5 days, followed by oral monotherapy according to the antibiogram. Cystitis requires an oral monotherapy for 3-7 days. In any case it is important to search for a cause to the infection.
