The effects of fosfomycin on penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) were studied on the methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strain CIP (Collection de l'Institut Pasteur, Paris, France) 65-25 and on a methicillin-susceptible S. aureus strain CIP 65-6. The combinations of fosfomycin and oxacillin were synergistic, additive or antagonistic, depending on antibiotic concentrations. Fosfomycin induced modifications of the PBP profile of the two strains studied. In particular, it increased the expression of PBP2. This suggested that this protein is inducible; the only PBP not affected by fosfomycin was PBP3.
