In this review, I will describe honeybee biology from my prospective as a veterinary pharmacologist and will provide a summary of my research project to search for effective drugs to control American foulbrood, a bacterial disease of honeybees. In conclusion, mirosamicin, a macrolide antibiotic, as a preventive and glutaral, an alkylating agent, as a disinfectant were the most promising drugs.
