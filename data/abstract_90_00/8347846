Tamoxifen is the endocrine treatment of choice for breast cancer. However, resistance to therapy and patient relapse inevitably occurs. In future treatment schedules, interferons could be administered with tamoxifen, in an attempt to prevent disease recurrence. Human recombinant interferon-beta SER (rIFN-beta SER) inhibited the growth in vitro of the estrogen receptor (ER) positive breast cancer cell line MCF-7 and the ER negative breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231. This inhibitory effect was achieved at doses of 50 U/ml and above. The growth of MCF-7 tumors in estradiol-stimulated athymic mice was greatly inhibited by high dose rIFN-beta SER treatment (10(6)U/day). In spite of the impressive antitumor effects upon MCF-7 tumors, rIFN-beta SER had no effect upon ER levels within the tumors at either the RNA or protein level, as measured by Northern blotting and ER-EIA respectively. High dose rIFN-beta SER (10(6)U/day) did result in some inhibition in the growth in vivo of the tamoxifen-stimulated MCF-7 variant MCF-7 TAM, although not to the same extent as was observed with the estradiol-stimulated MCF-7 tumors. rIFN-beta SER was also administered to animals bearing MCF-7 tumors and treated with estradiol and tamoxifen. In the animals undergoing high dose therapy (10(6)U/day), tumor growth was completely suppressed. Furthermore, tumor growth continued to be suppressed in those animals in which the rIFN-beta SER therapy was halted and the tamoxifen capsule removed. No tumors were observed in spite of the environment of estradiol stimulation. Thus, the combination of interferon and tamoxifen was totally growth suppressive for MCF-7 xenografts in nude mice.
