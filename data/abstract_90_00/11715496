OBJECTIVE: To investigate the mechanism of chloroquine improving insulin sensitivity. METHODS: The changes in insulin sensitivity and the effects of chloroquine were observed in insulin-resistant (IR) rats induced by high-fat feeding. RESULTS: In IR rats, the glucose infusion rate (GIR) determined by euglycemic clamp and 2-deoxyglucose (DG) uptake in the skeletal muscle were lower than those in normal rats, but the activity of insulin degradation of liver (LIA), fasting plasma insulin (FINS) and plasma lipids were higher. In the high-fat fed rats with chloroquine administration, GIR and 2-DG uptake in the skeletal muscle were increased, and LIA, FINS and some plasma lipid indices were decreased compared with the IR rats. CONCLUSION: Chloroquine can improve the insulin sensitivity and hamper the onset and development of insulin resistance.
