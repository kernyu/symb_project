Fifty-nine epidemiologically unrelated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) isolates from different geographical areas and 23 phage-type 77 MRSA isolates from France were investigated. Cellular DNA, digested with restriction endonucleases EcoRI or HindIII, was probed with plasmids carrying the gene encoding 16S rRNA (pBA2), the gene aacA-aphD (pSF815A) and the gene aacA-aphD plus part of IS256 (pIP1307). When probed with pBA2, most of the unrelated isolates displayed the same hybridisation pattern. A greater diversity in patterns was detected in gentamicin-resistant strains with the two other probes. The most accurate fingerprinting of these isolates was obtained with the probe pIP1307. Moreover, this probe appeared to be useful for tracing the phage-type 77 epidemic MRSA isolates widespread in French hospitals.
