We induced tolerance to hexadecylphosphocholine (HePC) in the human epidermoid tumor cell line, KB. After 70 weeks of adaptation, the IC50 of HePC in the resistant cells KBr was 32-fold higher than in parental KB cells, and they were 30-fold more resistant to another ether lipid analogue, ET-18-OCH3. The KBr cells also showed cross-resistance to vincristine and colchicine while remaining sensitive to other chemotherapy agents. RT-PCR assays showed that expression of the multidrug resistance gene (MDR1) was positive in KBr cells, whereas the expression of GST-pi (glutathione S-transferase pi) and MRP (multidrug resistance protein) was undetectable in KBr cells. Both an immunocytochemistry test and Western blot analysis indicated that the expression of bcl-2 in KBr cells was strongly positive, while it was only mildly expressed in KB cells. Verapamil could not reverse the resistance of KBr to HePC although it is a well-known reversing agent against MDR1. Our results suggest that bcl-2 instead of MDR1 plays a major role in the resistance of KBr cells.
