Candida norvegensis has been an unusual cause of infections in humans. In Norway this species was isolated from eight patients from 1990 to 1996 and was of probable pathogenic significance in four of them. All isolates were resistant to fluconazole. The same was true for two C. norvegensis isolates from before 1940, and it is therefore assumed that the fluconazole resistance is inherent.
