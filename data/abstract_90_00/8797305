Since 1989, outbreaks of Salmonella ser. Enteritidis food poisoning has dramatically increased in Tokyo, and a total of 95 outbreaks has been reported between 1989 and 1993. As the results of examination of phage type by the method of Ward, et al., strains isolated from 31 (32.6%) of 95 outbreaks were phage type 34 which is a very rare type in Europe and America. To characterize these unique strains of phage type (PT) 34, 302 isolates obtained from patients and vehicle foods of the outbreaks, eggs and environments in Tokyo were examined for plasmid DNA profiles and antimicrobial resistance patterns. Plasmid DNA was extracted by the Kado's method, and analysed by agalose gel electrophoresis. Antimicrobial susceptibility was tested for CP, TC, SM, KM, ABPC, NA, SXT, FOM and NFLX by the K-B disc method. The strains of PT 34 were further subdivided to 4 types by plasmid profile and antibiogram. The prevalent pattern of PT 34 strains was type plasmid profile which carried 2 different plasmids (> 250 and 60 kb) and was streptomysin-resistant. A total of 28 (90.3%) of 31 outbreaks were found to be caused by this specific type of Salmonella ser. Enteritidis. Several kinds of egg-related foods were suspected for the vehicles of transmission among 12 outbreaks. Especially, in 5 outbreaks, this specific type (type B plasmid profile and streptomysin resistant) of Salmonella ser. Enteritidis strains were isolated both from patients and incriminated food which were cooked with eggs. The phase type of Salmonella ser. Enteritidis strains isolated from raw egg and poultry or environmental specimens from poultry farm showed that the prevailing phage types were almost the same as those of foods poisoning outbreaks. This strongly suggests that these foods may be considered as a source of infection in Salmonella ser. Enteritidis outbreaks.
