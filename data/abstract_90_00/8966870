Clinicoimmunological characteristics were followed up in the course of laryngeal papillomatosis (LP) in 96 children. It was found that they had suppressed T-cell immunity, phagocytosis which still worsen with the disease aggravation and recurrences. A decrease in nonspecific resistance, properdin, lysozyme, complement and secretory IgA indicated impairment of nasopharyngeal and laryngeal local immunity. A scheme of combined treatment is proposed incorporating basic therapy with reaferon, systemic immunomodulators (thymalin, T-activin) and local immunocorrection. Such approach reduced the time of basic treatment and prolonged remission 2.5-3-fold.
