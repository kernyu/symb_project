Glass-adherent splenocytes from the rats who have swum and taken essentiale injections release a factor raising blood antiproteolytic proteins. alpha 1-Antiproteases and alpha 2-macroglobulin do not result in the immunomodulating properties of red blood cells. With alpha 2-macroglobulin, red blood cells acquire essentiale resistance. This limits the appearance of erythrocytes that have immunostimulating properties in the blood of the animals which have swum and received essentiale.
