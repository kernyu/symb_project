Six mupirocin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus were isolated from patients living in the northern part of Western Australia (WA). They were all resistant to methicillin, tetracycline, trimethoprim and cadmium and harboured similar 41.4 kb plasmids. Transfer and curing experiments with one of the isolates, WBG7569, demonstrated that the 41.4 kb plasmid encoded resistance to mupirocin, tetracycline, trimethoprim and cadmium. The isolates were compared by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis with methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) previously isolated from the Kimberley region in the northern-most part of WA (WA MRSA). The mupirocin-resistant isolates were found to be closely related to WA MRSA suggesting that they were WA MRSA which had acquired a new multiple-resistance plasmid encoding high-level mupirocin resistance.
