Lactococcus lactis cells secreting the lantibiotic nisin, commercially used for food preservation, must protect their cell membrane against the pore-forming activity of extracellular nisin. The nisI gene product has been suggested to be a lipoprotein, which due to the location on the extracellular surface would be an ideal candidate for an immunity protein. In vivo labelling of NisI from L. lactis N8 expressed in Escherichia coli proved that NisI is a lipoprotein. Expression of nisI in the nisin-sensitive L. lactis MG1614 strain resulted in immunologically active protein on the cytoplasmic membrane in comparable amounts to the immune strain L. lactis N8, but only to slightly increased nisin immunity, suggesting that additional proteins are needed for full immunity.
