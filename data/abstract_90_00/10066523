Several new antibacterial agents are currently being developed in response to the emergence of bacterial resistance to existing drugs. The new agents include compounds that inhibit macromolecular synthesis or interfere with bacterial membrane function. Apart from the oxazolidinones and cationic peptides, the remainder of these new compounds are analogues of earlier antibiotic classes; therefore, it is probable that existing resistance mechanisms will adapt to accommodate the new derivatives. To minimise the potential for emergence of resistance to new agents, research strategies should be chosen that not only enhance the discovery of structurally novel drugs, but also direct these to new molecular targets that may themselves have decreased potential to give rise to drug-resistant variants.
