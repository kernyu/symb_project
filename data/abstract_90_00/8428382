Phytophthora capsici, P. citricola, P. cinnamomi and P. citrophthora were transformed without the removal of cell walls by particle acceleration with plasmids containing the beta-glucuronidase gene and hygromycin B resistance. Transformants were detected by histochemical and fluorometric beta-glucuronidase assays and confirmed by Southern-blot hybridization. It was found that the promoter of a plant virus is functional in Phytophthora. In addition, a method was designed to visually identify homogeneous transformed colonies, derived from zoospores of transformed multinucleated Phytophthora mycelia, based on blue color development on plates containing X-Gluc.
