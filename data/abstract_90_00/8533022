1,500-2,000 head of cattle were treated with deltamethrin 1% Spot On in an area of high tsetse densities, notably of Glossina morsitans submorsitans. After four treatments at monthly intervals, the time between two treatments was increased to two months. 11 months after the commencement of the campaign the fly population had decreased from initially 54.2 flies/trap/day to densities varying between 0.06-2.0 flies/trap/day, mostly G. palpalis gambiensis. Blood-meal analysis showed that this species was surviving in limited areas, mainly feeding on monitor lizards; consequently it is unlikely that this species can be eradicated solely by the use of cattle treated with a pyrethroid. The resistance of Trypanosoma congolense to all commercially available trypanocides necessitated the epidemiological monitoring of calves which were born after the start of the campaign in order to reasses the real challenge. The risk of new infections was low, basically due to contracts between the cattle and tsetse outside the ranching area. A weight increase from 122.3 kg to 213.6 kg of calves aged 6-12 months was recorded from October 1993 to October 1994. An average daily weight gain of more than 400 g was observed from the end of April 1994 to the beginning of August 1994.
