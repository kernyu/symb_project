Various neuropsychiatric syndromes in typhoid fever were seen in nine patients of multiple drug resistant (both in vitro and in vivo) Salmonella typhi infection of a total of 270 suspected cases in the last two years. All but one patient received oral norfloxacin (400 mg 12 hourly) for two weeks with complete recovery, while the other patient died. Bacteremia and toxemia seem to be the only common factor responsible for neuropsychiatric complications.
