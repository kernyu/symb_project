OBJECTIVE: To determine the validity of an antimalarial drug history. DESIGN: During a chloroquine sensitivity study carried out from 27 February to 13 April, 1995, an antimalarial drug history was obtained from the patients. A urine test was used as a gold standard to screen for antimalarial drugs in these patients. SETTING: Two Mutare district primary health care centres. SUBJECTS: Fifty clinical malaria cases were screened. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cases were classified in a two by two contingency table based on the reported antimalarial drug and the results of the urine test. Positive predictive value and negative predictive value were then examined.
