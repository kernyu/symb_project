Using 92 Salmonella strains isolated from patients suspected of having infectious diseases of the intestinal tract who visited 13 hospitals in Japan during the six years between 1991 and 1996, we investigated the drug susceptibility, prevalence of conjugative R plasmid, and the plasmid profiles. 1) Of the bacterial isolates tested, 52.2% showed drug-resistance. Regarding the drug-resistance patterns, 70.8% of the isolates were resistant to a single drug, while 29.2% were multi drug-resistant. 2) Dividing the resistance patterns by the serotypes, among Salmonella Enteritidis isolates, single-drug resistance to SM was the most frequent, being detected in 27 isolates. Single-drug resistance to NA and two-drug resistance to SM/TC were the second-most frequent, each being detected in isolates. Among Salmonella Hadar isolates, four isolates showed two-drug resistance to SM/TC, and one isolate showed single-drug resistance to TC. Among Salmonella Typhimurium isolates, one isolate each showed three-drug resistance to ABPC/CER/KM and KM/TC/CP. Among Salmonella Agona isolates, one isolate each showed two-drug resistance to SM/TC and single-drug resistance to SM. Among Salmonella Derby isolates, two isolates showed single-drug resistance to SM. 3) The prevalence of conjugative R plasmid was investigated in 48 drug-resistant isolates, and six isolates (12.5%) contained the plasmid. 4) The prevalence of the plasmid was investigated in 29 drug-resistant S. Enteritidis isolates, and 22 isolates (75.9%) contained the plasmid. These isolated were classified by the plasmid profiles into types H1 to H7. 5) Regarding the plasmid profiles of the S. Enteritidis isolates, a position corresponding to 60 Kbp was the most frequently detected in 90.5%.
