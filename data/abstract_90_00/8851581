Plasmidic extended-spectrum beta-lactamases of Ambler class A are mostly inactive against ceftibuten. Salmonella typhimurium JMC isolated in Argentina harbors a bla gene located on a plasmid (pMVP-5) which confers transferable resistance to oxyiminocephalosporins, aztreonam, and ceftibuten. The beta-lactamase PER-2 (formerly ceftibutenase-1; CTI-1) is highly susceptible to inhibition by clavulanate and is located at a pI of 5.4 after isoelectric focusing. The blaPER-2 gene was cloned and sequenced. The nucleotide sequence of a 2.2-kb insert in vector pBluescript includes an open reading frame of 927 bp. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence of PER-2 with those of other beta-lactamases indicates that PER-2 is not closely related to TEM or SHV enzymes (25 to 26% homology). PER-2 is most closely related to PER-1 (86.4% homology), an Ambler class A enzyme first detected in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. An enzyme with an amino acid sequence identical to that of PER-1, meanwhile, was found in various members of the family Enterobacteriaceae isolated from patients in Turkey. Our data indicate that PER-2 and PER-1 represent a new group of Ambler class A extended-spectrum beta-lactamases. PER-2 so far has been detected only in pathogens (S. typhimurium, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis) isolated from patients in South America, while the incidence of PER-1-producing strains so far has been restricted to Turkey, where it occurs both in members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and in P. aeruginosa.
