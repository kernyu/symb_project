Chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium falciparum has been reported in the Sahel and forest regions of Cameroon since 1985. In vivo response to chloroquine treatment (25 mg/kg) was assessed in 19 patients with malaria in the savanna North-West province. 58% of the cases showed RII resistance to chloroquine. RIII resistance was suspected in one patient. Only 35% of cases showed complete parasite clearance by day 5 of treatment. Chloroquine reduced parasite counts by at least 87% in all patients. Chloroquine resistance now seems to be well established and widespread in Cameroon. Its rapid spread and the prevalence of resistance suggest the existence of sustained drug pressure resulting in rapid selection of less sensitive strains. Unfortunately, similar pressure is also being exerted with quinine.
