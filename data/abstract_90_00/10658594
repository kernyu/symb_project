New 6beta-cysteinesulfonamidopenicillanic acids and their sulfoxides were synthesized by sulfonylation of 6beta-aminopenicillanic acid or its (S)-sulfoxide with (R)-N-benzyloxycarbonylcysteinesulfonyl chloride ethyl ester (2a, 1b) and (R)-N-benzyloxycarbonylcysteinesulfonyl chloride benzyl ester (2a, 2b). The corresponding 6beta-cysteinesulfonamidopenicillanic acids sulfones 1c and 2c were prepared by oxidation of the sulfoxides 1b and 2b with potassium permanganate in aqueous medium. When combined with ampicillin some of the compounds reduced the minimal inhibitory concentrations of ampicillin against beta-lactamase producing strains.
