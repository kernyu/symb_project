We examined the in vitro cytokine modulation of the interaction of cultured renal tubular epithelial cells (hKEC) with lymphoid effector cells, including mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR)-derived blasts, Concanavalin A (Con A)-activated blast, and lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells. Blast adhesion to hKEC was augmented by treatment with either interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), or MLR supernatant. The augmented adhesion statistically correlated with intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) upregulation on hKEC cells by the cytokines. Blocking of surface ICAM-1 on hKEC or of lymphocyte-function antigen-1 (LFA-1) on the blasts significantly inhibited adhesion. LFA-1 blocking on LAK or MLR blasts resulted in a significant inhibition in cytotoxic function. TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta treatments on hKEC increased the susceptibility to LAK cytotoxicity, whereas IFN-gamma and MLR supernatant treatment significantly reduced this susceptibility. Absorption of IFN-gamma from the MLR supernatant partially restored the susceptibility of LAK cytotoxicity. The combined data suggest the importance of cytokine regulation of LFA-1/ICAM-1 adhesion molecule in these cellular interactions. Although IFN-gamma augments attachment between hKEC and blastic effector cells, this cytokine endows hKEC with resistance to LAK cytotoxicity. Thus, it is clear that cytokine modulation is a complicated phenomenon involving both adhesion molecule regulation-dependent and independent mechanisms.
