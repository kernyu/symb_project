Escherichia coli and Klebsiella spp. were screened for ESBL based on routine susceptibility testing results. Isolates with intermediate or resistant susceptibilities for extended spectrum cephalosporins or aztreonam were reported as probable ESBL producers. By using the NCCLS proposed ESBL confirmatory method, we tested 61 screen-positive isolates from 42 patients, 30 randomly selected susceptible isolates, and 12 isolates with previously characterized beta-lactamases. Ceftazidime contributed to 97% of screen-positive isolates, whereas aztreonam added a single patient isolate. An ESBL was confirmed in 86% of K. pneumoniae, 100% of K. oxytoca, and 20% of E. coli screen-positive single patient isolates. None of the susceptible isolates were shown to produce ESBL. Based on these findings a comment regarding the presence of ESBL seems sufficient for Klebsiella spp. but confirmatory testing is indicated for E. coli. 0.25 microg/mL was used to indicate the presence of ESBL, the specificity of the assay increased to 100%. The NCCLS ESBL phenotypic confirmatory method was reproducible and accurate enough to be used in the clinical laboratory.
