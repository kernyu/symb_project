Resistance of P. falciparum to mefloquine emerged along the Thai-Cambodian border following the falciparum malaria outbreak in Bo Rai areas in late 1988. Efforts have been made since then to prevent or delay the spread of multi-drug resistant strains by restricting the use of mefloquine, limiting the distribution of the drug for presumptive treatment and chemoprophylaxis, encouraging personal protection, strengthening the case follow-up system, increasing physician awareness, and mass treatment with primaquine of gem miners crossing the borders.
