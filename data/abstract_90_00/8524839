The inducible SOS system increases the survival of bacteria exposed to DNA-damaging agents by increasing the capacity of error-free and error-prone DNA repair systems. The inducible mutator effect is expected to contribute to the adaptation of bacterial populations to these adverse life conditions by increasing their genetic variability. The evolutionary impact of the SOS system would be even greater if it was also induced under conditions common in nature, such as in resting bacterial populations. The results presented here show that SOS induction and mutagenesis do occur in bacteria in aging colonies on agar plates. The observed SOS induction and mutagenesis are controlled by the LexA repressor and are RecA- and cAMP-dependent.
