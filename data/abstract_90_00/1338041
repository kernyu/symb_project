In vitro susceptibility of 1008 strains of recent clinical isolates was determined against the new aryl fluoroquinolone temafloxacin (T-167, A-63004) ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, ampicillin, piperacillin, cephalothin, cefoxitin, ceftazidime, gentamicin, amikacin, oxacillin and vancomycin. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of temafloxacin in micrograms/ml required for > or = 90% isolates were 0.13-0.5 for enterobacter, 0.03-0.25 for Escherichia coli, 0.12-0.5 for Klebsiella, 0.5-1.0 for Proteus mirabilis, 0.12-0.5 for Morganella morganii, 0.03-0.12 for Salmonella, 0.25-1.0 for Serratia marcescens, 0.03-0.12 for Shigella, 0.06-4.0 for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 0.06-0.12 for Aeromonas hydrophila, 0.12-0.5 for Staphylococcus aureus, 0.12-1.0 for coagulase negative staphylococci and 4.0-8.0 for enterococci. The antibacterial activity of temafloxacin was comparable or superior to other drugs tested against most organisms. However, Xanthomonas malthophilia was relatively more susceptible to ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin, and temafloxacin had significantly high antibacterial activity against enterococci as compared to other fluoroquinolones.
