The precise duration of therapy of multidrug-resistant (MDR) typhoid with broad-spectrum cephalosporins is uncertain. We prospectively randomized 57 children with culture-proven MDR typhoid to receive treatment with intravenous ceftriaxone (CRO) (65 mg/kg of body weight/day) for 7 days (short course; n = 29) or 14 days (conventional; n = 28). The response to therapy, as evaluated by the serial monitoring of the typhoid morbidity score and bacteriological clearance, was comparable between groups. In contrast to the conventional therapy, 14% of the children receiving CRO for 7 days had a confirmed bacteriological relapse within 4 weeks of stopping therapy.
