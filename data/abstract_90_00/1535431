The relative fecundity of populations of Eimeria tenella was estimated by means of mixed infection using electrophoretic variation of glucose-phosphate isomerases (GPIs) as a genetic marker. A decoquinate-resistant strain with GPI-9 isozyme (DR-NIAH), a decoquinate-sensitive one with GPI-1 (DS-Iwate), and three decoquinate-resistant lines (No. 3, 4, and 5) derived from cross-fertilization between DR-NIAH and DS-Iwate, were used. The GPI phenotypes of the No. 3 and No. 4 lines are GPI-9, and that of No. 5 is GPI-1. Mixed infection experiments were performed between DR-NIAH and DS-Iwate, No. 3 and No. 5, and No. 4 and No. 5. DR-NIAH was predominant over DS-Iwate in the mixed infection, whereas, in single infections, the total oocyst output of DR-NIAH was similar to or less than that of DS-Iwate. Among three lines, No. 4 was predominant over No. 5, and No. 5 was predominant over No. 3 in the mixed infection. Relative fecundity between No. 3 and No. 5 and their patterns of oocyst output in single infections were similar to those in the mixed infection. In contrast, No. 5 produced more oocysts than No. 4 in single infections, suggesting that the oocyst production in the mixed infection may be influenced by the mutual interference or competition between the populations of E. tenella in the chicken caeca.
