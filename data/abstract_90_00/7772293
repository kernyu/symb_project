The expression of Saccharomyces cerevisiae SUC genes is exclusively regulated by catabolic repression, mediated by glucose. Genes involved in this process have been defined by means of mutants either unable to express invertase or with constitutive phenotype, although none of the genes is specific for invertase regulation. The affected genes in mutants unable to produce invertase are designated SNFX. These genes can be assorted into two groups considering either their function in regulation of gene expression or their epistatic relationships. Mutants with constitutive phenotype have been selected either by resistance to 2-deoxyglucose or by suppression of snf mutations. Among the different genes previously outlined, some of which code for transcription factors, only the MIG1 product, a "zinc finger" protein, shows a clear capacity of binding DNA in vitro. Besides the ON/OFF switch mechanism of the expression of SUC genes, some genes seem to play a role in modulating invertase expression, either hindering or stimulating transcription. A model to define the relationship between the different gene products involved in the regulation of transcription of the SUC genes is proposed.
