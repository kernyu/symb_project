The filamentous fungus Penicillium chrysogenum showed remarkable resistance to the oxidative stress caused by high concentrations of either hydrogen peroxide (0.35-0.70 M) or tert-butyl hydroperoxide (tert-BOOH, 0.5-2.0 mM), which could be explained well with high levels of glutathione (GSH) peroxidase and catalase activities. The majority of exogenous H2O2 was likely removed by catalase from the cells while tert-BOOH was likely eliminated mainly by the GSH-dependent pathways. The GSH pool decreased considerably at high tert-BOOH concentrations, the glutathione disulphide (GSSG) pool increased at high H2O2 and tert-BOOH concentrations, meanwhile all the peroxide concentrations tested increased markedly the intracellular peroxide concentration. All the enzyme activities taking part in the glutathione metabolism (glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase and glutathione producing activities) except glutathione S-transferase increased significantly after exposing mycelia to both peroxides while the specific glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and catalase activities remained unchanged. In the presence of 0.5 mM diamide both GSSG and GSH concentrations as well as the glutathione reductase and glutathione producing activities were elevated but no significant changes were found in the intracellular peroxide concentration or in any of the other enzyme activities examined.
