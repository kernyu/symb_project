The use of chloroquine (CQ), during the dry season was determined for 236 patients from 5 villages in Biombo, Republic of Guinea Bissau, West Africa. The antimalarial drug was measured in whole blood (dried samples) using High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) and in urine samples by Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). The results showed that CQ consumption is low.
