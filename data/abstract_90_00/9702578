Eleven cancer patients colonized with vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) were followed as outpatients. Environmental cultures were obtained from clinic rooms before and after patients care. Environmental contamination occurred in 29% of encounters. Superficial disinfection did not eradicate contamination, although more thorough cleaning did. We conclude that environmental VRE contamination occurs in the outpatient setting. Infection control practices, similar to those used in the inpatient setting, may be necessary for outpatient clinics.
