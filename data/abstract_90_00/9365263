A novel method for detection and identification of specific alleles has been developed utilizing immobilized mismatch binding protein (IMBP). The assay involves the use of biotin-labeled probes, which are prepared by PCR amplification of cloned fragments with known sequence. The use of probes avoids many of the problems associated with the extreme sensitivity of IMBP assays to errors in PCR amplification. The method can be used to monitor PCR fidelity and to genotype both diploid and haploid organisms and has been used to distinguish rifampicin-sensitive and -resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and to detect and distinguish two alleles of the sheep prion protein gene involved in susceptibility to scrapie.
