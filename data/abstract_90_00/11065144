Communicating information from antimicrobial resistance surveillance study data to microbiologists and physicians can be challenging. Large amounts of data, commonly reaching millions of MICs or zone diameter endpoints, must be analysed and condensed to easily-read tables or figures. Furthermore, data must not be prejudged relative to susceptibility categories, because of the diverse nature of interpretive criteria available internationally. An attempt must be made to present results of all surveillance studies in a mode that can be reinterpreted for immediate use in different geographical areas, or used to compare future data with relative ease and high accuracy. Such data displays require peer-reviewed journals to permit greater numbers of more complex tables to present results. The Meropenem Yearly Susceptibility Test Information Collection (MYSTIC) study is a year-on-year global surveillance programme in medical centres where meropenem is available for use. We have developed a presentation strategy that expands the long-term clinical value of MYSTIC results. In addition to statistical parameters, tables of cumulative percentages or numbers of strains inhibited at each tested antimicrobial concentration will be presented. Alternative figures (Finland-o-grams) could also be used, but these generally lack precise extractable rates and require more journal space. Regardless of study design, promotion of this presentation philosophy enhances any surveillance study's value to each reader or user and facilitates application to locally appropriate interpretations. The widespread use of these analysis and presentation principles as benchmarks by various resistance studies and networks is strongly encouraged, particularly by investigations across international boundaries.
