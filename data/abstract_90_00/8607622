Twenty-two patients with previously treated acute myeloid leukemia (AML) received salvage chemotherapy with mitoxantrone, 5 mg/m2/d on days 1 to 3, etoposide, 70 mg/m2/d on days 1 to 5, and enocitabine, 170 mg/m2/d on days 1 to 7 (BHAC-ME). Additional mitoxantrone, etoposide (both for up to 2 days) and enocitabine (for up to 7 days) were given if the bone marrow obtained on day 8 was not severely hypoplastic. Mitoxantrone and etoposide had been previously administered in 14 and 15 patients, respectively. Seven patients had primary resistance; 14 patients had first relapse (4 early and 10 late): and 2 patients had second relapse. Overall, seven patients (31%) achieved a complete remission; 7/14 with first relapse, and 0/8 with primary resistance or second relapse. Four patients, 3 with primary resistance and 1 with first relapse, died of infectious complication in aplasia. First relapse patients who had been previously treated both with mitoxantrone and etoposide, had a lower CR rate than the other first relapse patients [2/8 (25%) vs 5/6 (86%)], although patient characteristics such as duration of first CR, initial karyotype, and performance status, were similar between the two groups. We conclude that response-oriented BHAC-ME regimen is still active in first relapse AML patients unless they have received both mitoxantrone and etoposide previously.
