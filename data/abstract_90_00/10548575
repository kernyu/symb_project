Salivary anticandidal activities play an important role in oral candidal infection. R. P. Santarpia et al. (Oral Microbiol. Immunol. 7:38-43, 1992) developed in vitro anticandidal assays to measure the ability of saliva to inhibit the viability of Candida albicans blastoconidia and the formation of germ tubes by C. albicans. In this report, we describe modifications of these assays for use with small volumes of saliva (50 to 100 microl). For healthy subjects, there is strong inhibition of blastoconidial viability in stimulated parotid (75%), submandibular-sublingual (74%), and whole (97%) saliva, as well as strong inhibition of germ tube formation (>80%) for all three saliva types. The susceptibility of several Candida isolates to inhibition of viability by saliva collected from healthy subjects is independent of body source of Candida isolation (blood, oral cavity, or vagina) or the susceptibility of the isolate to the antifungal drug fluconazole. Salivary anticandidal activities in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients were significantly lower than those in healthy controls for inhibition of blastoconidial viability (P < 0.05) and germ tube formation (P < 0. 001). Stimulated whole-saliva flow rates were also significantly lower (P < 0.05) for HIV-infected patients. These results show that saliva of healthy individuals has anticandidal activity and that this activity is reduced in the saliva of HIV-infected patients. These findings may help explain the greater incidence of oral candidal infections for individuals with AIDS.
