Chemotherapy for trypanosomiasis in domestic livestock depends on only a few compounds, of which several are chemically closely related. Of these compounds, the most widely used therapeutic agent in cattle, sheep and goats is diminazene aceturate. Diminazene was first described in 1955. Subsequently, a substantial body of data has been generated on various pharmacological aspects of the compound. In this review, we consider the current status of knowledge concerning the therapeutic spectrum of diminazene, resistance to diminazene in trypanosomes, and combination therapeutic regimens in which diminazene has been administered together with other compounds. Analytical techniques for diminazene, the pharmacokinetics of diminazene, data concerning diminazene's toxicity, and the different molecular mechanisms by which diminazene may exhibit trypanocidal action are also considered.
