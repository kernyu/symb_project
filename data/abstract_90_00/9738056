Modified MicroScan gram-positive MIC no. 8 panels (PM-8) were analyzed for their improved ability to detect vancomycin resistance (VR) and high-level aminoglycoside resistance (HLAR) in enterococci. A validation study design that utilized selected challenge strains, recent clinical isolates, and reproducibility experiments in a multicenter format was selected. Three independent medical centers compared the commercial panels to reference broth microdilution panels (RBM) and Synergy Quad Agar (QA). Resistance was verified by demonstration of VR and HLAR genes by PCR tests. The study was conducted in three phases. (i) In the challenge phase (CP), two well-characterized sets of enterococci were obtained from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; one set contained 50 isolates for VR testing and one contained 48 isolates for HLAR testing. In addition, a set of 47 well-characterized isolates representing diverse geographic areas, obtained from earlier national surveillance studies, was tested at the University of Iowa College of Medicine (UICM). (ii) In the efficacy phase (EP), each laboratory tested 50 recent, unique clinical isolates by all methods. (iii) In the reproducibility Phase (RP), each laboratory tested the same 10 strains by all methods in triplicate on three separate days. All isolates from the EP were sent to the UICM for molecular characterization of vanA, -B, -C1, -C2-3, and HLAR genes. In the CP, the ranking of test methods by error rates (in parentheses; very major and major errors combined, versus PCR results) were as follows: for high-level streptomycin resistance (HLSR), QA (12.0%) > PM-8 (5.2%) > RBM (1.6%); for high-level gentamicin resistance (HLGR), RBM (3.7%) > PM-8 (3.1%) > QA (2.6%); and for VR, RBM = QA (3.0%) > PM-8 (1.2%). In the EP, agreement between all methods and the reference PCR result was 98.0% for HLSR, 99.3% for HLGR, and 98. 6% for VR. In the RP, the percentages of results +/- 1 log2 dilution of the all-participant mode were as follows: for VR, 100% (PM-8), 98.9% (QA), and 90.0% (RBM); for HLSR, 99.6% (RBM), 98.5% (PM-8), and 82.2% (QA); and for HLGR, 99.6% (RBM), 99.3% (PM-8), and 98.1% (QA). The ability of the PM-8 to detect VR and HLAR in enterococci was comparable to those for reference susceptibility and molecular PCR methods and was considered acceptable for routine clinical laboratory use.
