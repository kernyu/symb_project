Seventy isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae with extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) were compared. These were isolated from 51 patients on 10 separate wards in one hospital over an 18-month period between 1992 and 1994. Antibiograms were determined and the isolates were typed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis of their DNA digestion with XbaI. The isolates were compared to three genotypically different epidemic strains responsible for previous outbreaks at the hospital between 1988 and 1991. Isolates from 84% of the present patients had closely related XbaI patterns, and most (74%) produced an ESBL with an iso-electric point (pI) of 7.0. A similar pattern was found for one of the previous epidemic strains, but it produced an ESBL with a pI of 7.8; isolates with this latter enzyme variant were found only in six of the present patients. The two other previous epidemic strains had ESBLs with a pI of 6.3 and organisms related to them were found in one and two of the present patients, respectively.
