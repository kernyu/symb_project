Over five and a half months stool cultures were performed in 154 patients admitted with suspected bacillary dysentery to the Professorial Paediatric Unit of the Teaching Hospital, Galle. Thirty one patients had a positive stool culture; Shigella dysenteriae type 1 was isolated in 23 patients, and S flexneri in 8. In both groups the antibiotic sensitivity pattern was uniform, the only difference being S dysenteriae type 1 being resistant to nalidixic acid while S flexneri was sensitive. This antibiotic sensitivity pattern was different to that reported from Colombo during the same period. Complications were observed in some patients with S flexneri infection.
