Falciparum malaria remains a major killer in developing countries, particularly for African children. The sequestration of parasitized erythrocytes in the deep microvasculature is mostly mediated by their cytoadherence to activated endothelium. Proinflammatory cytokines and particularly tumor necrosis factor contribute to severe disease but the pathophysiology of coma remains poorly understood. In young children, features of severe malaria include severe anemia, hypoglycemia and cerebral malaria. Half of the children with neurological impairment actually have raised intracranial pressure, and seizures are extremely common. Clinical respiratory distress usually reflects severe lactic acidosis. In non immune adults, pictures of severe sepsis with shock, acute renal failure and respiratory distress syndrome are common and often associated with bacterial coinfection. Although chemotherapy of malaria is challenged by the continuing evolution of antimalarial resistance, quinine remains the first-line drug for severe disease. The optimization of symptomatic management of severe malaria remains a major concern in developing countries.
