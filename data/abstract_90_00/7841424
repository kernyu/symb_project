SETTING: Sureyyapasa Center for Chest Diseases and Thoracic Surgery, Istanbul, Turkey between January 1992 and December 1992. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the prevalances of initial and acquired resistance to antituberculosis drugs in our center. DESIGN: 785 patients with pulmonary tuberculosis (both old = 525/785 and new = 260/785 cases) referred to our center were evaluated with respect to their drug resistance patterns. RESULTS: The overall resistance rate (1 or more drugs) was 35.5%, with initial resistance 26.6% (140 of 525) and acquired resistance 53.4% (139 of 260). Initial resistance to streptomycin was the most frequent (20.6%), followed by rifampicin (10.8%), isoniazid (5.1%) and ethambutol; (4.2%). Initial resistance was noted as 16.4% to 1 drug, 7.7% to 2 drugs, 1.2% to 3 drugs and 1.3% to 4 drugs. Acquired resistance to rifampicin was the most frequent (36.2%) followed by streptomycin 31.9%, and isoniazid 30%. Acquired resistance was found as 18.7% to 1 drug, 19.3% to 2 drugs, 9.6% to 3 drugs and 5.8% to 4 drugs. CONCLUSION: High initial drug resistance in Turkey may well threaten the success rates of antituberculosis treatment and it is therefore mandatory to begin antituberculosis treatment in routine practice in our country with at least 4 first-line drugs, replacing streptomycin with ethambutol due to high resistance to streptomycin. In conclusion there is an urgent need for a nationwide tuberculosis control programme in Turkey, where the treatment of old cases is still challenging, in order to combat the grave situation of high initial and acquired drug resistance.
