Resistance to the mouse pneumonitis (MoPn) strain of Chlamydia trachomatis has been mapped to MHC class II-restricted, IL-12-dependent CD4+ T cells that secrete a type 1 profile of proinflammatory cytokines, which includes IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha. The relative contribution of IFN-gamma is controversial, however, due to variation in results presented by different laboratories. To determine whether C. trachomatis strain differences contributed to this apparent conflict, the relative resistance of IFN-gamma-deficient mice to murine and human strains of C. trachomatis was compared. All human serovars were much more sensitive to the direct inhibitory actions of IFN-gamma than the MoPn strain. Furthermore, genital clearance of human serovar D in the C57BL/6 mouse was mediated by class II-independent mechanisms that probably involved local production of IFN-gamma by cells of the innate immune system. TNF-alpha also contributed indirectly to host resistance against all strains tested. The differential susceptibility of distinct C. trachomatis strains to effector cytokines such as IFN-gamma could not have been predicted by interstrain biologic variation or by the profile of cytokines stimulated during infection. These findings indicate that strain variation should be considered in situations where related isolates of a given parasite produce conflicting data in models of infection and immunity. They also suggest that stimulation of mucosal IFN-gamma activity is a relevant goal for a human chlamydial vaccine.
