We found that 23% of 435 patients treated for a femoral neck fracture in our department also were treated for a urinary tract infection during their hospital stay. The most common pathogen was Escherichia coli, sensitive for mecillinam in 98% of the cases. The most frequently used antimicrobial agent was a broad-spectrum antibiotic, fluoroquinolon, although the most reasonable choice would have been a non broad-spectrum agent such as mecillinam. Catheterization was not a predisposing factor for urinary tract infection, but a poor medical condition and female sex were. We did not find a higher mortality rate among patients with a urinary tract infection.
