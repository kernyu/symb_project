The susceptibilities of 123 clinically isolated strains of Xanthomonas maltophilia to six fluoroquinolones (clinafloxacin, PD 131628, PD 138312, PD 140248, ciprofloxacin, and ofloxacin) were examined by microdilution MIC methodology. Clinafloxacin and PD 131628 were the most active compounds tested (MICs for 50% of the strains tested [MIC50s] of 0.5 and 1.0 microgram/ml and MIC90s of 2.0 and 4.0 micrograms/ml, respectively). PD 138312, PD 140248, ciprofloxacin, and ofloxacin were less active, with MIC50s ranging from 4.0 to 8.0 micrograms/ml and MIC90s of 16.0 micrograms/ml for all four compounds. Only clinafloxacin and PD 131628 were active against ciprofloxacin-resistant strains, with MIC50s of 0.5 and 1.0 microgram/ml and MIC90s of 2.0 and 4.0 micrograms/ml, respectively.
