It has been variously hypothesized that the insulin resistance induced in rodents by a high-fat diet is due to increased visceral fat accumulation, to an increase in muscle triglyceride (TG) content, or to an effect of diet composition. In this study we used a number of interventions: fish oil, leptin, caloric restriction, and shorter duration of fat feeding, to try to disassociate an increase in visceral fat from muscle insulin resistance. Substituting fish oil (18% of calories) for corn oil in the high-fat diet partially protected against both the increase in visceral fat and muscle insulin resistance without affecting muscle TG content. Injections of leptin during the last 4 days of a 4-wk period on the high-fat diet partially reversed the increase in visceral fat and the muscle insulin resistance, while completely normalizing muscle TG. Restricting intake of the high-fat diet to 75% of ad libitum completely prevented the increase in visceral fat and muscle insulin resistance. Maximally insulin-stimulated glucose transport was negatively correlated with visceral fat mass (P < 0.001) in both the soleus and epitrochlearis muscles and with muscle TG concentration in the soleus (P < 0.05) but not in the epitrochlearis. Thus we were unable to dissociate the increase in visceral fat from muscle insulin resistance using a variety of approaches. These results support the hypothesis that an increase in visceral fat is associated with development of muscle insulin resistance.
