BACKGROUND: Acid pump inhibitors combined with antimicrobials cure gastritis and peptic ulcer disease but a standard therapy has not yet been established. We therefore investigated a triple therapy with pantoprazole. METHODS: The aim of this open-label monocenter trial, involving 30 intention-to-treat patients with peptic ulcer disease or functional dyspepsia, was to assess the H. pylori cure rate after a 7-day triple therapy with pantoprazole (40 mg bid) plus metronidazole (500 mg bid) and amoxicillin (1 g bid). The H. pylori status was assessed by rapid urease test, histological examination and culture at the initial examination and by histological examination and culture at the study end 4 weeks after ending all therapy. RESULTS: At the end of the trial H. pylori was eradicated in 21 of 27 per protocol patients (78%; 95% CI 58-91%) and in 21 of 30 patients included in the trial (70%; 95% CI 51-85%). In 15 of 16 per protocol patients with metronidazole-sensitive strain (94%; 95% CI 70-100%) the infection was cured, but in contrast eradication was accomplished in only one of 3 patients with a metronidazole-resistant H. pylori strain. Post-treatment resistance to metronidazole was observed in 6 cases, although 4 of them had had H. pylori strains sensitive to metronidazole at the initial visit. The gastritis had clearly been improved, and the activity of gastritis had completely disappeared 4 weeks after treatment. Seven adverse events were observed in 7 patients, the intensity of which was moderate in 6 cases. CONCLUSIONS: This short-term triple therapy with pantoprazole, amoxicillin and metronidazole provides an effective regimen especially in patients with metronidazole-sensitive strain.
