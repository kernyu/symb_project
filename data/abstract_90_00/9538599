Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae) is the most common bacterial cause of pneumonia, meningitis, and otitis media, with the highest incidence among young children and the elderly. S. pneumoniae was once routinely susceptible to penicillin, but since the mid-1980s the incidence of resistance to penicillin and other antimicrobial agents has been increasing all over the world. To optimize empirical regimens and initial therapy for S. pneumoniae infections, clinical healthcare providers must be informed about the prevalence and pattern of drug resistance among the isolates in their communities. No such data are available for the Malaysian population. Therefore, this study was designed to determine the antibiotic susceptibility pattern of S. pneumoniae among colonized pre-school children in Kota Bharu, Malaysia. Pharyngeal swabs were collected from children 1 month to 6 years of age. S. pneumoniae isolates were identified according to the standard and tested for penicillin resistance with a 1-microgram oxacillin disk by the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion methods. Of 355 nasopharyngeal specimens obtained from kindergarten students, in-patients and pediatric clinics over a period of 1 year, S. pneumoniae was isolated from 36 (10 per cent). All isolates, except one, were susceptible to penicillin. The resistant isolates was susceptible to erythromycin, chloramphenicol and cephalosporins.
