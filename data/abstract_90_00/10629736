A multicentre trial was performed on the activity of cefepime in comparison with ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, piperacillin/tazobactam, imipenem and ciprofloxacin against severe hospital infection pathogens in intensive care units. The isolates of Escherichia coli and Proteus spp. from the majority of the centres were highly susceptible to the antibiotics (90 to 100 per cent of the isolates). In some centres up to 40 per cent of the isolates produced ESBL. The isolates of Klebsiella spp. were characterized by lower susceptibility, in some centres the frequency of the strains producing ESBL exceeded 90 per cent, by the MIC geometric mean cefepime was superior to the third generation cephalosporins, the frequency of resistance to ciprofloxacin ranged from 0 to 31 per cent, no resistance to imipenem was recorded. The frequency of resistance to the third generation cephalosporins and piperacillin/tazobactam in Enterobacter spp., Serratia spp., Citrobacter spp., Morganella spp., and Providencia spp. ranged from 10 to 52 per cent, the resistance to cefepime equaled 0-11 per cent, 0 to 17 per cent of the isolates were resistant to ciprofloxacin, some isolates were resistant to imipenem. As for the nonfermenting microorganisms their resistance to all the antibiotics tested was comparatively high and markedly differed in various centres. As a whole, 7 per cent of all the isolates of the nonfermenting organisms was resistant to cefepime, 10 per cent was resistant to imipenem, 17 per cent was resistant to ceftazidime, 21 per cent was resistant to piperacillin/tazobactam and 36 per cent was resistant to ciprofloxacin.
