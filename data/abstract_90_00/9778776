Groups of lambs either with or without controlled-release albendazole (ABZ) capsules (CRCs) were challenged twice weekly for 6 weeks with either drug-susceptible or drug-resistant Ostertagia circumcincta and Trichostrongylus colubriformis. Groups with and without CRCs remained unchallenged as controls. There was minimal establishment of drug-susceptible parasites of either species in those lambs with CRCs. However, drug-resistant parasites of both species established adult worm burdens in the presence of the capsules. The humoral immune response, as measured by the serum antilarval (L3) antibody (Ab) titre, was pooled for weeks 4-6 and compared for each group. With the exception of anti-T. colubriformis Ab in group 2, anti-L3 Ab titres were significantly higher in all the parasite-challenged groups as compared to the control animals. Also, with the exception of anti-resistant O. circumcincta Ab levels in the CRC-treated animals (group 5), no significant difference was observed in Ab titres between the four groups challenged with either resistant or susceptible larvae. The results demonstrate the inability of CRCs to prevent establishment of drug-resistant parasites and that immune stimulation is not inhibited by the capsules.
