We have found that cerulenin, an antibiotic that inhibits de novo fatty acid and cholesterol biosynthesis and fatty acylation of proteins, strongly inhibited the cytotoxicity of ricin, modeccin, Pseudomonas toxin, and diphtheria toxin in a brefeldin A (BFA)-resistant mutant of Vero cells (BER-40). The protective effect of cerulenin against ricin was also observed in two other BFA-resistant cell lines, Madin-Darby canine kidney, and PtK1 cells. In contrast to BER-40 cells, no significant effect of cerulenin was observed in Vero cells. Cerulenin did not affect the binding of ricin to the cell-surface receptors, but reduced significantly the internalization of ricin in BER-40 cells; no effect of cerulenin on the binding or internalization of ricin was observed in Vero, PtK1, and Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. Endocytic uptake of fluid-phase markers such as horseradish peroxidase and lucifer yellow was inhibited by cerulenin in BER-40 cells, but the endocytosis of transferrin via the coated pit/coated vesicle pathway was slightly increased. Cerulenin inhibited the degradation and excretion of ricin in BER-40 cells, and this effect of cerulenin was not observed in Vero cells. Furthermore, cerulenin inhibited the bulk protein secretion in a dose-dependent manner, with BER-40 cells being more susceptible than Vero cells. These results suggest that in addition to its effect on endocytosis, cerulenin interferes with the intracellular trafficking or processing of toxin molecules, and the vesicle transport system in BER-40 cells appears to be cerulenin-sensitive. Since addition of fatty acids and cholesterol did not reverse the effects of cerulenin, the protective effect of cerulenin against protein toxins is not due to an inhibition of de novo fatty acids and cholesterol biosynthesis.
