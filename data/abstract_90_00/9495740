A new insertion element, IS1549, was identified serendipitously from Mycobacterium smegmatis LR222 during experiments using a vector designed to detect the excision of IS6110 from between the promoter region and open reading frame (ORF) of an aminoglycoside phosphotransferase gene. Six of the kanamycin-resistant isolates had a previously unidentified insertion element upstream of the ORF of the aph gene. The 1,634-bp sequence contained a single ORF of 504 amino acids with 85% G+C content in the third codon position. The putative protein sequence showed a distant relationship to the transposase of IS231, which is a member of the IS4 family of insertion elements. IS1549 contains 11-bp terminal inverted repeats and is characterized by the formation of unusually long and variable-length (71- to 246-bp) direct repeats of the target DNA during transposition. Southern blot analysis revealed that five copies of IS1549 are present in LR222, but not all M. smegmatis strains carry this element. Only strains with a 65-kDa antigen gene with a PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism type identical to that of M. smegmatis 607 contain IS1549. None of 13 other species of Mycobacterium tested by PCR with two sets of primers specific for IS1549 were positive for the expected amplified product.
