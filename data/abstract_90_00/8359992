An outbreak of haemonchosis associated with anthelmintic resistance was recorded in a flock of 150 crossbred lambs. Closantel and ivermectin were 100% effective against Haemonchus contortus while fenbendazole and morantel reduced faecal egg counts by 87 and 29%, respectively. Levamisole showed an efficacy of 95%. At double the recommended dose (10 mg kg-1), fenbendazole had an efficacy of 99% against H. contortus infection. This appears to be the first report of an outbreak of haemonchosis associated with fenbendazole and morantel resistance in a strain of H. contortus in sheep.
