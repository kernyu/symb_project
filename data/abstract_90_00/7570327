BACKGROUND: The role of enterococcus in intraabdominal infection is controversial. This study examines the contribution of enterococcus to adverse outcome in a large intraabdominal infection trial. METHODS: A randomized prospective double-blind trial was performed to compare two different antimicrobial regimens in combination with surgical or percutaneous drainage in the treatment of complicated intraabdominal infections. A total of 330 valid patients was enrolled from 22 centers in North America. RESULTS: In 330 valid patients, 71 had enterococcus isolated from the initial drainage of an intraabdominal focus of infection. This finding was associated with a significantly higher treatment failure rate than that of patients without enterococcus (28% versus 14%, p < 0.01). In addition, only Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score and presence of enterococcus were significant independent predictors of treatment failure when stepwise logistic regression was performed (p < 0.01 and < 0.03). Risk factors for the presence of enterococcus include age, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II, preinfection hospital length of stay, postoperative infections, and anatomic source of infection. There was no difference between the clinical trial treatment regimens with regard to overall failure, failure associated with enterococcus, or frequency of enterococcal isolation. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to report enterococcus as a predictor of treatment failure in complicated intraabdominal infections. This trial also identifies several significant risk factors for the presence of enterococcus in such infections.
