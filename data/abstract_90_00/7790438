The ability of the Alamar microdilution MIC system to detect vancomycin resistance in enterococci was evaluated by comparing the results with an agar dilution screen method. Of 100 strains tested, 41 were resistant and 47 were susceptible by both tests. Five strains were intermediate and one was resistant by the Alamar MIC system but susceptible by the agar screen. Three strains each were susceptible or intermediate by the Alamar MIC system but resistant by the agar screen. The predictive values for the Alamar MIC system were 94% (susceptible) and 88% (combined intermediate and resistant). The Alamar MIC system does not appear to have sufficient accuracy for the detection or confirmation of vancomycin resistance in enterococci.
