In the search for new ketolides with improved activities against erythromycin-resistant S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae we synthesized a new 11,12 carbamate ketolide substituted by an imidazo-pyridyl side chain: HMR 3647. This compound demonstrated a potent activity against erythromycin susceptible and resistant pathogens, including penicillin G/erythromycin A-resistant S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae. In vivo, HMR 3647 displayed good pharmacokinetic parameters (Cmax = 2.9 microg/ml, bioavailability=49%, AUC0.8 = 17.2 microg.h/l, t1/2=1h) and was shown to have a high therapeutic efficacy in mice infected by various respiratory pathogens, including multi-resistant S. pneumoniae and Gram negative bacteria such as H. influenzae. HMR 3647 appears to be a very promising agent for the treatment of respiratory infections and is currently in clinical trials.
