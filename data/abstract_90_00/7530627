A recent resurgence of interest in tuberculosis as a global health problem has accompanied the resurgence of tuberculosis in both industrialised and developing countries. It has also been demonstrated recently that tuberculosis treatment and control is one of the most cost effective of all medical interventions. The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) epidemic and increasing resistance to antituberculous drugs complicate our response to the problem of tuberculosis. Chemotherapy with currently available agents is highly effective, not only in pulmonary tuberculosis in adults, but also in extrapulmonary disease, and in disease in children and even patients with concomitant HIV infection. Short course chemotherapy and intermittent therapy are as effective as older regimens. Measures, including directly observed therapy, to maximise compliance with therapy, are of utmost importance. An efficient programme which assures compliance with effective antituberculosis chemotherapy should be a priority for health spending even in those countries with fewest resources.
