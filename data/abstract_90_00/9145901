The comparative in vitro activity of RU 64004 (also known as HMR 3004), a new ketolide antibiotic, was tested by agar dilution against approximately 500 gram-positive organisms, including multiply resistant enterococci, streptococci, and staphylococci. All streptococci were inhibited by < or = 1 microg of RU 64004 per ml. The ketolide was more potent than other macrolides against erythromycin A-susceptible staphylococci and was generally more potent than clindamycin against erythromycin A-resistant strains susceptible to this agent. Clindamycin-resistant staphylococci (MIC, > 128 microg/ml) proved resistant to the ketolide, but some erythromycin A- and clindamycin-resistant enterococci remained susceptible to RU 64004.
