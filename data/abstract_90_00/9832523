Two biotypes (A and B) of Colletotrichum gloeosporioides infect the tropical legumes Stylosanthes spp. in Australia. These biotypes are asexual and vegetatively incompatible. However, field isolates of biotype B carrying a supernumerary 2-Mb chromosome, thought to originate from biotype A, have been reported previously. We tested the hypothesis that the 2-Mb chromosome could be transferred from biotype A to biotype B under laboratory conditions. Selectable marker genes conferring resistance to hygromycin and phleomycin were introduced into isolates of biotypes A and B, respectively. A transformant of biotype A, with the hygromycin resistance gene integrated on the 2-Mb chromosome, was cocultivated with phleomycin-resistant transformants of biotype B. Double antibiotic-resistant colonies were obtained from conidia of these mixed cultures at a frequency of approximately 10(-7). Molecular analysis using RFLPs, RAPDs, and electrophoretic karyotypes showed that these colonies contained the 2-Mb chromosome in a biotype B genetic background. In contrast, no double antibiotic colonies developed from conidia obtained from mixed cultures of phleomycin-resistant transformants of biotype B with biotype A transformants carrying the hygromycin resistance gene integrated in chromosomes >2 Mb in size. The results demonstrated that the 2-Mb chromosome was selectively transferred from biotype A to biotype B. The horizontal transfer of specific chromosomes across vegetative incompatibility barriers may explain the origin of supernumerary chromosomes in fungi.
