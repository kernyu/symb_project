BACKGROUND: Mutations in the hepatitis B virus (HBV) genome may occur during therapy. METHODS: We report an asymptomatic HBV carrier who underwent transplantation for end-stage renal disease. She developed an HBV flare 6 months after transplantation and was placed on lamivudine. After initial rapid improvement, she relapsed clinically and virologically. She decompensated with jaundice, peripheral edema, ascites, encephalopathy, coagulopathy, and hepatorenal syndrome. A liver biopsy specimen revealed submassive necrosis. RESULTS: Emergency liver transplantation was performed: lamivudine was discontinued. Hepatitis B immunoglobulin and adefovir dipivoxil were initiated. Sixteen months after orthotopic liver transplantation, she is HBV DNA seronegative with normal liver enzymes. Sequencing of HBV polymerase gene from preliver transplantation sera did not detect the usual lamivudine resistance mutations in the YMDD motif but instead two other mutations (F514-->L, L528-->M). Lamivudine resistance was demonstrated in vitro. CONCLUSIONS: Asymptomatic HBV carriers may reactivate following renal transplantation after immunosuppression. Resistance to lamivudine may result in severe hepatic damage in immunocompromised patients.
