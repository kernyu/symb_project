Dictyostelium discoideum amoebae can be induced to acquire a non-degradative resistance to the pea phytoalexin pisatin. The nysB sunD double mutant is blocked in the acquisition of this resistance. Using parasexual genetics it has been shown that sunD is a recessive mutation linked to nysB on linkage group VI.
