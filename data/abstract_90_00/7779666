Assessment of clinical and laboratory markers of HIV infection may be used to individualise antiretroviral therapy. Data suggest that measures of viral load may be of considerable value as both a baseline and dynamic therapy marker, making these tools particularly useful in driving therapeutic decisions. Similarly, in-vitro data regarding intracellular pharmacokinetics and activity, resistance patterns and potential synergy of antiretroviral agents may be used to guide selection of optimal treatment regimens in clinical practice.
