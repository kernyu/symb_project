Microbiological investigations regarded samples from diseased tissue in patients with larynx carcinoma and in 53 patients. Samples were also taken two weeks after surgery from postoperative wounds. The patients received after surgery ciprofloxacin and metronidazole for five days. Cultures were incubated in aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Isolated microorganisms were tested by application of the API system susceptibility to ciprofloxacin, netilmicin and gentamycin were determined. Samples from cancerous tissue and postoperative wounds revealed most frequently presence of streptococci, staphylococci, Bacteroides and intestinal bacteria. It was found, however, that in investigated patients different bacterial flora was present when compared with previously tested cancerous tissue. Hemolytic streptococci and Staphylococcus aureus, and less frequently enterococci, were found much more frequently, Isolated strains were susceptible to ciprofloxacin (93%), netilmicin (76%) and gentamycin (39%).
