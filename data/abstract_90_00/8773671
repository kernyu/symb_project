AIMS: Standard triple therapy remains the recommended first line treatment for Helicobacter pylori in New Zealand. The real eradication rate achieved in busy hospital clinics may be different from data obtained from clinical trials outside of New Zealand. METHODS: One hundred and thirty patients with proven H pylori infection (by at least two tests) were treated with low dose triple therapy (DeNol 1 qid, tetracycline 250 mg qid and metronidazole 200 mg qid for 2 weeks; dosing with meals and at night); 83 were given a standard prescription for triple therapy (dispensed in bottles) and 47 were given a medication pack with times of dosing clearly marked. Eradication was proven by a negative 13C urea breath test at least 4 weeks after finishing treatment. RESULTS: Follow up urea breath test was obtained in 120 patients (92%). The eradication rate for separate bottles was 79% and for the medication pack 76%. Compliance was estimated to be greater than 90% in 92% of patients who attended for followup. H pylori culture and sensitivity results were available for 41 patients. Overall rate of metronidazole resistance was 32%. The eradication rate for metronidazole sensitive strains was 89% and for resistant strains 46%. Mild side effects were reported in 10% and moderate side effects in 10%. No patient stopped treatment because of side effects. There was no effect of age, ethnicity, smoking, alcohol intake, pretreatment with H2-antagonists or endoscopic diagnoses on eradication rates. CONCLUSION: The low dose triple therapy has an acceptable real eradication rate. The most important determinant of success was metronidazole resistance. The eradication rate was not improved by using medication packs.
