A 73-year-old male was admitted to our hospital because of detection of Shigella flexneri 2a from his stool. Antimicrobial treatment with levofloxacin (LVFX) was started, but could not eliminate the organism in the stool. In the examination of drug susceptibility, this strain was highly resistant to all new quinolones. The minimal inhibitory concentration of norfloxacin, ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin to this strain was 12.5 micrograms/ml, 6.25 micrograms/ml and 6.25 micrograms/ml, respectively. The dual mutations were detected in the codon 83 and 87 of the gyrA gene by sequencing the quinolone-resistance determining region (QRDR). There was, however, no significant difference between the intracellular uptake of ciprofloxacin in this strain and in the ciprofloxacin-sensitive strain. The amount of ciprofloxacin in this strain unchanged when carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone (CCCP) was added. These results suggest that the advanced resistance in Shigella flexneri against new quinolones could be acquired by only this dual mutations without the change of the active efflux mechanism.
