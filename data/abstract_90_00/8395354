We have constructed a series of promoter or upstream activating sequence (UAS)-probe plasmids carrying the Tn5-derived neomycin resistance gene whose seven additional ATG codons in the 5'-untranslated region were completely or partially removed. When the deleted version of the neo sequence retaining only one additional ATG (NeoD) was expressed under the control of a TDH3 promoter whose UAS was deleted, the transformed cells were unable to grow at a low concentration of the antibiotic G418. In contrast with this, yeast cells expressing the NeoC sequence and having no additional ATG exhibited a high level of G418-resistance. Moreover, the UAS-probe system using NeoD has been successfully applied for the identification of several E. coli DNA sequences that clearly function as UASs in yeast cells. Two of these prokaryotic sequences with UAS activity were identified as a part of the coding region of the tgt and the hydG gene, respectively.
