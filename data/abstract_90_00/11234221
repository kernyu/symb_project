The frequency and the antibacterial sensitivity of Streptococcus pneumoniae strains isolated from 6 key hospitals (in 5 areas) and 1 otorhinolaryngology clinic in Gifu Prefecture from February to March, 1999, were investigated with several antibiotics. A total of 128 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae were isolated throughout the study: 47 strains (36.7%) of penicillin-susceptible S. pneumoniae (PSSP), 51 strains (39.8%) of penicillin-intermediate S. pneumoniae (PISP), and 30 strains (23.4%) of penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP); the resistant bacteria being relatively prominent. In these hospitals, PSSP was isolated by 38.8% in all the key hospitals and by 30% in the otolaryngology clinic with almost no discernible difference. PISP was isolated by 63.3%, higher in the otolaryngology clinic and PRSP by 28.6%, higher in the key hospitals conversely. The MIC90s in PISP and PRSP were determined with the antibiotics. In result, only cefditoren (CDTR) showed favorable antibacterial activities with the MIC90 of 0.78 microgram/ml among penicillins or oral cephems. The MIC90s of carbapenems such as imipenem (IPM), meropenem (MEPM), and panipenem (PAPM) were less than 0.39 microgram/ml; particularly, PAPM showed the highest antibacterial activities. Among new quinolones such as tosufloxacin (TFLX), levofloxacin (LVFX), sparfloxacin (SPFX), and ciprofloxacin (CPFX), TFLX showed the highest antibacterial activities with the MIC90 of 0.39 microgram/ml. Other agents showed very low antibacterial activities as the MIC90s were 25 micrograms/ml in minocycline (MINO) and more than 100 micrograms/ml in clarithromycin (CAM) and clindamycin (CLDM).
