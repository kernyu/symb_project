Vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) are gaining much attention in the West, chiefly because of the lack of available antimicrobial therapy for VRE infections as most VRE are also resistant to drugs previously used to treat such diseases (e.g. aminoglycosides and ampicillin), the possibility that the vancomycin-resistant genes present in VRE can be transferred to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and increasing reports of VRE and the trend towards endemicity in North America. There are three case reports and a study showing stool carriage of more than 10% from Singapore. One of the case reports is notable as the VRE isolated from the urinary tract is community-acquired. In Europe, there is a strong association between the use of avoparcin (a glycopeptide) in animal feeds and the emergence of VRE. Clonal dissemination resulting in nosocomial transmission is also demonstrated. Prior vancomycin use is a risk factor for the subsequent development of VRE bacteraemia. The laboratory plays an important role, namely, a) detection of VRE, and b) determination of susceptibilities of antimicrobials whereby possible therapeutic options may be instituted when antimicrobial intervention is indicated. There is a need to evaluate existing infection control measures against VRE to prevent it from becoming endemic in Singapore as had happened in North America.
