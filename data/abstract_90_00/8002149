BACKGROUND: Tinea capitis is a fungal infection in which topical therapy is often unsuccessful. Griseofulvin has been considered to be a first-line therapy. Other antifungal agents are the azole derivatives. Among these, itraconazole was compared with griseofulvin in children in a double-blind study. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-four children and one adult with clinical signs and symptoms of tinea capitis and with positive culture and microscopy for dermatophytes have been included in a double-blind comparison between itraconazole, 100 mg daily, and ultramicronized griseofulvin, 500 mg daily. Both drugs were given for 6 consecutive weeks. The final evaluation was made 8 weeks after the end of treatment to allow the hairs to regrow. Seventeen itraconazole- and 15 griseofulvin-treated patients received the complete 6-week treatment course. Fifteen of these 17 itraconazole patients and 14 of the 15 griseofulvin patients had infections caused by Microsporum canis. Fifteen of 17 patients were cured by itraconazole (88%) and 15 of 17 patients by griseofulvin (88%). One of the patients who discontinued griseofulvin therapy after 4 weeks was clinically and mycologically cured. Two of the original 17 griseofulvin patients discontinued therapy because of vomiting. None of the itraconazole-treated children experienced side effects. CONCLUSIONS: Itraconazole is the first azole derivate that matches griseofulvin for the treatment of tinea capitis in children. The drug also appears to be better tolerated than griseofulvin.
