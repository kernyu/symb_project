The features of nonspecific defense factors were studied in 42 patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and in 18--with chronic subleukemic myelosis (CSM), in the presence of the treatment including polychemotherapy and plasmocytapheresis. Significant changes have been detected in the humoral factors of nonspecific defense (lysozyme, beta-lysins, complement components), as well as in the cellular component (phagocytic activity of the cells) in CML patients, these changes were growing with the leukemic process progressing. Plasmocytapheresis conducted produced no appreciable effect on the parameters of nonspecific resistance in the patients.
