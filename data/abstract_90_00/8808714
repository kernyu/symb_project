In vitro susceptibility to erythromycin, azithromycin, penicillin G, ceftriaxone and ceftibuten was investigated in 190 Streptococcus pyogenes strains isolated over a 4-year period (1991-1994) from patients attending a university hospital located in central Italy. The rate of susceptibility to macrolide antibiotics of the S. pyogenes strains showed a progressive decrease (from 90.3% in 1991 to 79.5% in 1994), while all strains were susceptible to the three beta-lactam antibiotics. Owing to the reduced prevalence of macrolide-susceptible S. pyogenes strains, in vitro susceptibility testing of streptococcal isolates appears to be always necessary before starting a macrolide-based chemotherapy. Concerning beta-lactams, ceftriaxone presented minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) always equal to or lower than those of penicillin G, while the oral long-acting cephalosporin, ceftibuten, had MICs higher than those of the other beta-lactams, although in the susceptible range. Results of in vitro susceptibility testing are discussed in relation to their implications for antimicrobial chemotherapy of S. pyogenes infections.
