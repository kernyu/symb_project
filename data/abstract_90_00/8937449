In difluoromethylornithine-resistant L1210 cells stimulated to grow from quiescence, haloperidol caused an early and dose-dependent inhibition of the induction of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) activity, with an IC50 of 3.5 microM. This effect was accompanied by a reduction in the ODC mRNA level and inhibition of cell growth. Other sigma ligands of different chemical classes inhibited the induction of ODC activity, whereas sulpiride, a dopamine antagonist devoid of sigma-binding affinity, was ineffective. These results indicate that the inhibition of ODC expression may be an early event involved in the antiproliferative response of leukemia cells to haloperidol.
