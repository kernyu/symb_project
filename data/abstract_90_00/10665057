A total of 115 strains of herpes simplex virus were isolated from clinical material collected in patients with genital herpes. The majority (93%) of isolated strains were sensitive to acyclovir: ID50 varied from 0.15 to 0.80 microgram/ml acyclovir. Eleven (7%) strains from 4 patients were resistant to acyclovir: ID50 was 30-125 times higher in comparison with the reference HSV-1 strain L2.
