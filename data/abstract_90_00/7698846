The teichomycin antibiotics have been discovered and chemically purified in the late 1970s. Teicoplanin, one of the major derivatives of this group, has been introduced into clinical use in 1984. In Germany, teicoplanin was licensed in 1988 and now ranks among the antimicrobial agents most frequently used in intensive care units. Due to its reduced rate of side effects compared to vancomycin, its longer serum half-life and a simplified mode of application, teicoplanin has become the glycopeptide of choice in many hospitals. The present review summarizes in vitro activity data, pharmacokinetics, and clinical experience with teicoplanin, with special consideration of currently recommended doses and serum levels.
