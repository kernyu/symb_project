Pharmacoeconomic study models have a number of inherent problems that significantly limit their use within the medical community. They are frequently retrospective and thus have only limited relevance in a field in which resistance patterns are highly volatile. Moreover, the study models do little to consider the numerous economic perspectives involved, such as the patients themselves as well as society at large. Prescribing patterns profoundly affect overall healthcare costs. As much as $8.4 billion is spent on community-acquired pneumonia each year; 8% of that cost is for antibiotic therapies. Moreover, studies show that inappropriate prescribing for upper respiratory tract infections is the norm not the exception, with significant cost and health consequences. Also adding to costs is patient noncompliance, which could possibly be reduced with once-daily dosing regimens and widespread patient education about appropriate use of antibiotics.
