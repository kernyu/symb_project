Corynebacterium urealyticum is usually resistant to multiple antibiotics. We analyzed whether previous hospitalization and/or the use of antibiotics was a factor associated with the appearance of resistance to different antibiotics in C. urealyticum. Our findings suggest that resistant strains of C. urealyticum are likely to be acquired directly from the hospital environment and that the use of antibiotics in the hospital setting could favor the appearance of multiresistant strains.
