Four carbapenem antibiotics were tested for their in-vitro activities (MICs, MBCs and time-kill studies) against Burkholderia pseudomallei. The carbapenems were all more active than either ceftazidime or co-amoxiclav against strains of B. pseudomallei with a normal susceptibility pattern. Biapenem was the most active antibiotic tested. All four carbapenems retained bactericidal activity against 24 strains of B. pseudomallei with reduced susceptibility to ceftazidime and/or co-amoxiclav.
