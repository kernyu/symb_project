AIM: Currently, highly effective Helicobacter pylori eradication therapies are used, and although eradication failures still appear in a considerable proportion of cases, the therapeutic efficacy in such refractory cases has been only exceptionally studied. Therefore, our aim was to evaluate the appropriate attitude when eradication therapy fails. METHODS: In 127 duodenal ulcer patients, several therapies with omeprazole (O) plus one or two antibiotics [amoxycillin (A), clarithromycin (C), metronidazole (M)] had failed to eradicate H. pylori. Re-treatment was administered depending on initial therapy; in no case was the same regimen repeated, and antibiotics with resistance risk (as C or M) were only re-administered using combination regimens with bismuth (B): O + A + C + B (when C was re-administered) and O + bismuth triple therapy (BTT) (when M was re-administered). RESULTS: First therapy and eradication rates, with the corresponding second therapy, were: CONCLUSION: BTT re-treatment in O + A failure achieves a relatively low eradication rate, probably lower than BTT for the first time, suggesting that other regimens should be tried. The following re-treatments are recommended in H. pylori eradication failure: in O + A failure, BTT (or O + BTT, as BTT re-treatment could be less effective than the initial BTT treatment); in O + C failure, O + A + M; in O + A + C failure, O + BTT; in O + A + M failure, O + A + C; and, finally, in O + C + M failure, O + BTT (or O + A + C + B).
