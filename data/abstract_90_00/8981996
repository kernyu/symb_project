We developed a gene replacement system using the rpsL gene of Streptomyces roseosporus and demonstrated its utility by constructing a deletion in the S. roseosporus glnA gene. A 1.3-kb BamHI fragment that hybridized to the Mycobacterium smegmatis rpsL gene was subcloned from an S. roseosporus cosmid library and sequenced. Plasmid pRHB514 containing the rpsL gene conferred streptomycin sensitivity (Sm(S)) to the Sm(r) S. roseosporus TH149. The temperature-sensitive plasmid pRHB543 containing rpsL and the S. roseosporus glnA gene disrupted with a hygromycin resistance (Hm(r)) gene was introduced into S. roseosporus TH149, and recombinants containing single and double crossovers were obtained after a temperature increase. Southern hybridization analysis revealed that single crossovers occurred in the glnA or rpsL genes and that double crossovers resulted in replacement of the chromosomal glnA gene with the disrupted glnA. Glutamine synthetase activity was undetectable in the recombinant containing the disrupted glnA gene.
