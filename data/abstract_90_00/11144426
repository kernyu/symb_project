One hundred and forty-three single-patient methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) isolates collected during April-June, 1997, and February, 1998, in a hospital in Tokyo, Japan, were characterized by molecular typing techniques that involved hybridization of ClaI restriction digests with the mecA- and Tn554-specific DNA probes and determination of macrorestriction patterns of SmaI-digested chromosomal DNA by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). A large proportion (76%) of the isolates carried the mecA polymorph I, Tn554 pattern A, and PFGE pattern A (clonal type I:A:A), which was the same as the clonal type of an MRSA widely spread in hospitals in New York City and hospitals in neighboring New Jersey, Connecticut, and Pennsylvania. Also similarly to the New York clone, most of the MRSA isolates from the Japanese hospital were resistant to penicillin, ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, tetracycline, and high concentrations (500 microg/ml) of spectinomycin, but were susceptible to chloramphenicol, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, and rifampin. All of the 143 MRSA isolates had vancomycin MICs < or = 2 mg/L.
