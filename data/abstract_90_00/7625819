Characterization of a ganciclovir-resistant cytomegalovirus strain from a patient with AIDS showed a histidine-to-glutamine change at residue 520 of UL97 (Q520 mutation). In anabolism studies, Q520 was associated with impaired phosphorylation of ganciclovir. Transfer of Q520 to a recombinant virus resulted in a ganciclovir-resistant phenotype.
