The activity of selected antimicrobial agents was determined against strains of Staphylococcus aureus that were isolated from bovine intramammary infections and that were positive or negative for beta-lactamase. A total of 107 S. aureus strains (70 that were positive for beta-lactamase and 37 that were negative for beta-lactamase) were used in the study. Production of beta-lactamase was determined using a chromogenic cephalosporin disk method. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) for each test strain were determined using a commercially available microdilution panel. The following compounds were tested: penicillin, ampicillin, oxacillin, cephapirin, ceftiofur, penicillin plus novobiocin, erythromycin, and pirlimycin. Of the five beta-lactam compounds tested, penicillin and ampicillin were most affected by beta-lactamase activity, but oxacillin, cephapirin, and ceftiofur were not affected. Penicillin plus novobiocin also demonstrated excellent activity against strains of S. aureus that were both positive and negative for beta-lactamase. Erythromycin and pirlimycin demonstrated good activity against the S. aureus strains that were negative for beta-lactamase; 90% of the isolates had an MIC of < or = 0.5 microgram/ml (MIC90). The MIC90 for erythromycin and pirlimycin for strains that were positive for beta-lactamase was > 64.0 micrograms/ml. However, 8 strains, in addition to producing beta-lactamase, were also resistant to macrolides and lincosaminides. Recalculation of the MIC90 without these 8 strains yielded equivalent values for both erythromycin and pirlimycin with strains that were positive or negative for beta-lactamase (MIC90 < or = 0.5 microgram/ml).
