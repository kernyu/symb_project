Interleukin-11 (IL-11) is a novel cytokine that has been shown to stimulate human hematopoietic progenitors including the CD34+ CD33- DR- early progenitors. IL-11 has little effect on its own but it synergizes with other hematopoietic growth factors. We investigated the recovery of human myeloid progenitors incubated with IL-11 alone or in combination with other cytokines, including stem cell factor (SCF), interleukin-3 (IL-3) and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) following their in vitro treatment with ARA-C (10(-9) M) or Eilatin (10(-7) M). IL-11 in combination with IL-3 and GM-CSF markedly increased CFU-C colony growth pre- and post-ARA-C or Eilatin incubation from CML and normal individual bone marrow (BM) cells. Similarly, IL-11 alone or in combination with other cytokines increased cell recovery following 7-day suspension culture. A decrease in BCR/ABL fusion product was observed (by FISH analysis) after incubation of BM cells from CML patients in liquid culture for 7 days with 10(-9) M ARA-C or 10(-7) M Eilatin in the presence of IL-11 alone or in combination with other cytokines. These results indicate that following cytoreductive therapy IL-11 may enhance to a greater extent the growth of normal myeloid progenitors than the malignant clone and may, therefore, be of clinical importance for CML patients treated with chemotherapeutic agents.
