We characterized 18 genes from Caenorhabditis elegans that, when mutated, confer recessive resistance to inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase. These include previously described genes as well as newly identified genes; they encode essential as well as nonessential functions. In the absence of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, the different mutants display a wide range of behavioral deficits, from mild uncoordination to almost complete paralysis. Measurements of acetylcholine levels in these mutants suggest that some of the genes are involved in presynaptic functions.
