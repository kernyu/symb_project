Normal adult rat chromaffin cells show a robust proliferative response in vitro to nerve growth factor (NGF) and other mitogens. In contrast, PC12 rat pheochromocytoma cells proliferate in the absence of exogenous mitogens and undergo neuronal differentiation in response to NGF. We demonstrate in this work that the antiproliferative drug rapamycin suppresses normal chromaffin cell proliferation. This effect is blocked by FK 506, indicating that it occurs via interaction of rapamycin with its intracellular binding protein, FKBP. Rapamycin must be added within 2 days of mitogen stimulation in order to be fully effective. PC12 cells are refractory to the antiproliferative effect of rapamycin, although rapamycin does exert its expected inhibitory effect in PC12 cells on both basal and NGF-stimulated activation of one of its biochemical targets, the 70-kDa S6 protein kinase (p70S6K). The discordant findings suggest that a proliferative signal normally requiring activation of p70S6K either is unnecessary in PC12 cells or is provided by a downstream or cross-communicating pathway. They also suggest that p70S6K does not participate in the morphological responses of PC12 cells to NGF. Determining the basis for rapamycin resistance in PC12 cells might help to identify signaling abnormalities involved in the pathogenesis of pheochromocytoma.
