This comparative study determined the effect of blood on the antienterococcal activities of the newer cephalosporins. Standardized disk diffusion susceptibility tests were performed with 57 strains of enterococci (30 Enterococcus faecalis strains) on Mueller-Hinton agar with and without 5% sheep blood supplementation. Twelve cephalosporins representing five different structural groups (based on the 7-alpha position substitution) were tested. The greatest frequency of activity enhancement by blood was observed with cefdaloxime and cefdinir (7-alpha hydroxyimino group) against E. faecalis. Cephalosporins with a 7-alpha methoxyimino group (cefpodoxime, cefepime, and cefpirome) had marked increases in zone diameters (3 to > 9 mm) when tested with the blood supplement. Cephems with 7-alpha amino or carboxy substitutions did not demonstrate any enhanced activity. Awareness of this phenomenon is important for the interpretation and accuracy of cephalosporin susceptibility testing.
