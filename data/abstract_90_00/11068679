Staphylococcus aureus is an important pathogen of humans and other animals, causing bacteremia, abscessation, toxemia, and other infectious diseases. An animal model using CD-1 mice was developed to study the pathogenesis of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA). When inoculated into the CD-1 mouse model, it was shown that both MSSA isolates, (HR 78 and CSA-1) and MRSA isolates (MRSA 456 and MRSA 457) led to chronic infection of the kidney. Female CD-1 mice inoculated with MRSA 456 proved to be more susceptible to infection and mortality than their male counterparts. Castrated mice became more susceptible to infection than intact male mice, suggesting a hormonal involvement in the infection process.
