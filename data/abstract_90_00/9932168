BACKGROUND: Gemcitabine is a novel nucleoside analogue which has shown promising results in most solid tumors; like the arabinosylcytosine analogue, gemcitabine may be an active drug in lymphoproliferative malignancies. We tested it in pretreated peripheral T-cell lymphoma patients with isolated skin involvement. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a phase II study with the drug in 13 pretreated patients with peripheral T-cell lymphoma, five of whom had advanced-stage mycosis fungoides (MF), and eight peripheral T-cell lymphoma unspecified (PTCLU). Patients were treated on days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28-day schedule at the dosage of 1200 mg/m2 for a total of three courses. RESULTS: Of the 13 patients, one achieved complete response (CR) and eight achieved partial responses (PR); the remaining four showed no benefit from the treatment. Among the responders, one CR and four PR were documented in the PTCLU patients and four PR in MF patients. Treatment was well tolerated; hematologic toxicity was mild and no nausea/vomiting or organ toxicity was recorded. CONCLUSIONS: In view of its significant activity and its modest toxicity profile, the role of gemcitabine deserves further evaluation in the management of pretreated patients with peripheral T-cell lymphoma.
