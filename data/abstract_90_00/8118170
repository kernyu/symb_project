Silver resistance was studied in a silver-resistant Pseudomonas stutzeri AG259 strain and compared to a silver-sensitive P. stutzeri JM303 strain. Silver resistance was not due to silver complexation to intracellular polyphosphate or the presence of low molecular weight metal-binding protein(s). Both the silver-resistant and silver-sensitive P. stutzeri strains produced H2S, with the silver-resistant AG259 strain producing lower amounts of H2S than the silver-sensitive JM303 strain. However, intracellular acid-labile sulfide levels were generally higher in the silver-resistant P. stutzeri AG259 strain. Silver resistance may be due to formation of silver-sulfide complexes in the silver-resistant P. stutzeri AG259 strain.
