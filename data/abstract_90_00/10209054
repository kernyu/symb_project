The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of the microorganisms causing uncomplicated acute urinary tract infections in the community and their susceptibility to cefixime and another six antimicrobials in frequent use in Spain. In 1998, we conducted an open, prospective study of 1,000 consecutive patients in five large provincial capitals who had positive urine culture, met the inclusion criteria, and were referred to the microbiology laboratory for urinalysis on an outpatient basis. The procedures for sample collection, transportation, laboratory techniques and the evaluation criteria were the same in all cases. The prevalence of the microorganisms found was similar to that published in the last few years by authors of various studies in Spain. Escherichia coli was the most frequently isolated bacteria (82.67% of the Gram-negative bacteria). The decrease in susceptibility of the isolates to the antimicrobials most empirically used was confirmed in these infections at the general practitioner's. Therefore, it is suggested that cefixime, an oral cephalosporin with the greatest activity against these microorganisms, is useful.
