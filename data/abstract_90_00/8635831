A nursery epidemic caused by multidrug resistant Salmonella typhimurium is reported. In total, 21 infants developed symptomatic illness; of these, 17 had septicemia (7 blood culture positive) and 4 had diarrhea alone. Asymptomatic carrier state was identified in 13 infants. Male sex and birth asphyxia increased the risk for symptomatic illness. Fever, lethargy, and diarrhea were the most common clinical features. Amongst the septicemic infants there was no difference in clinical profile whether the blood culture was positive or negative for S. typhimurium. In the symptomatic group, S. typhimurium was isolated from feces in 19 cases and from blood in 7 cases. In both symptomatic and asymptomatic infants, all isolates of S. typhimurium, whether obtained from feces and/or from blood, were resistant to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, and trimethoprim, and a significant number (almost one-fifth) of them also showed resistance to third generation cephalosporins. More than 90% of isolates were sensitive to aminoglycosides and ciprofloxacin. On a combination of third generation cephalosporin (cefotaxime or ceftriaxone) and amikacin, 17 (81%) infants recovered, 2 succumbed to their illness, and 2 failed to improve and required ciprofloxacin. The origin of epidemic was traced to a carrier staff nurse working in nursery.
