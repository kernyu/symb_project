We have constructed two plasmid vectors which allow selection for in vivo deletions within cloned DNA fragments. The plasmids are derivatives of pBR322 which carry the Escherichia coli rpsL (strA) gene, known to confer a dominant streptomycin (Sm)-sensitivity phenotype to the host cell, and a copy of the IS1 transposable element. Sm-resistant strains that harbor these plasmids display sensitivity to Sm. Spontaneous IS1-promoted deletions across the rpsL gene can be isolated simply by selection for Sm resistance. Hence, nested sets of deletions of a cloned DNA can be obtained and sequenced with an IS1-specific primer. Using this approach, we have determined the complete nucleotide sequence of the omega interposon [Prentki and Krisch, Gene 29 (1984) 303-313].
