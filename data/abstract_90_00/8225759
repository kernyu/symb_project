A new assay for detecting resistance to anthelmintics in vitro is described. The assay uses a simple culture system in which the ability of anthelmintics to kill or inhibit the migration of parasitic third and fourth stage Haemonchus contortus larvae through a 50 microns aperture mesh is assessed. The assay detects 2-10-fold resistance to closantel. Resistance to benzimidazoles, levamisole and ivermectin can also be detected.
