Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies on cefozopran (CZOP) were performed in children. The results were as followed: 1. A total of 13 patients were treated with CZOP. The tested dose was 20 mg/kg (50 mg/kg in maxillary sinusitis), and the drug administered via intravenous bolus injection or 30-minute intravenous drip infusion 3 times daily, for 3-11 days. Clinical efficacies of CZOP in 13 patients with bacterial infections (11 with pneumonia, 1 with otitis media and 1 with maxillary sinusitis) were evaluated as excellent in 13 with an efficacy rate of 100%. Any adverse reactions or abnormal laboratory test results were not observed in any patients. Fourteen causative strains were found in 10 patients. Streptococcus pneumoniae in 4 cases out of 4, Streptococcus pyogenes in 1/1, Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis in 3/3, Haemophilus influenzae in 4/6 were eradicated. 2. Pharmacokinetic studies. The mean serum concentration immediately after intravenous drip infusion over 30-minute of 20 mg/kg was 39.1 micrograms/ml (range: 25.6-52.5 micrograms/ml). The mean urinary recovery rate over 8 hours after administration was 49.0% (range: 45.2-51.8%). Based on the above results and the broad spectrum and great antibacterial activity of CZOP, it is considered that CZOP is a promising antibiotic usable as a single agent for the primary therapy of acute bacterial infections ranging from mild to severe in children.
