In 182 pigs lung lavage was performed using a endotracheal tube and a catheter. The collected bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was examined microbiologically. With decreasing numbers alpha-hamolytic Streptococci, Bordetella bronchiseptica, Haemophilus parasuis, Pasteurella multocida were cultured. Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae was isolated from 3 BALFs. In one farm piglets were lavaged routinely for monitoring of the lung health status.
