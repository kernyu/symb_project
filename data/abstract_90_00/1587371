We present the case of an infertile patient, whose first attempt at IVF had to be postponed for 18 months due to a vulvovaginal yeast infection refractory to treatment. The main causative organism was a Candida glabrata strain resistant to all the imidazolic agents tested. The organism and the host's humoral status were studied in depth, looking for possible causes of the refractoriness to treatment.
