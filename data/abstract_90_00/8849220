Two genes (rpsL and rrs) with mutations associated with streptomycin resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis were characterized in 78 streptomycin-resistant and 61 streptomycin-susceptible isolates recovered from patients living in the United States, South America, Europe, Africa, and Asia. Fifty-four percent of the 78 resistant organisms had missense mutations in codon 43 of rpsL resulting in a K-43-->R substitution. Mutations in codon 88 of rpsL were also identified in four Asian isolates.
