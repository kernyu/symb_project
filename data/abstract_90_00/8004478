During the ten year period (1981-1990) of detection of Pseudomonas aeruginosa susceptibility towards anti-Pseudomonas antibiotics a decrease in susceptibility towards GEN took place, namely from 91.7% to 80.0%. Susceptibility towards STR, COL and POL has not altered. During the course of five years we recorded a remarkable augmentation in resistance towards the group of 10 new antibiotics NET-by 24.3%, TIC-by 20.6% and AZL-by 18.5%. The most effective antibiotics of this group were CIP (100%), AMI (98.6%), OFL (99.3%), and CTZ (100%). Eight combinations of antibiotics were tested on 100 strains and CTX+GEN was proved to be the most effective combination-synergistic effect on 92.0 strains. The comparison of the effect of CTX+GEN combination on 12 strains implies identical results gained by both, the plate dilution method and the method of detection of lethal effect rate. For the purpose of routinized examinations the dilution micromethod is the most suitable. (Tab. 4, Ref. 19.).
