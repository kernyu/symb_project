To investigate whether the difference in cellular sensitivity of Chinese hamster V79 and their H(2)O(2)-resistant variant cells (Hpr-4) to H(2)O(2) relates to the difference in intracellular Ca(2+) concentration in these cells, we measured Ca(2+) concentration by calcium ion analysis after loading these cells with Fura-2/AM. Intracellular Ca(2+) concentration increased in both Chinese hamster V79 and Hpr-4 cells as extracellular Ca(2+) concentration increased. However, the increase in intracellular Ca(2+) concentration in response to extracellular H(2)O(2) was more pronounced in Hpr-4 than V79 cells. H(2)O(2) cytotoxicity of Hpr-4 but not V79 cells was also decreased in response to the increase in extracellular Ca(2+) concentration. In parallel with the decrease in cytotoxicity in response to increasing extracellular Ca(2+) concentration, the frequency of mitochondrial DNA single strand breaks (SSB) in Hpr-4 cells also decreased without producing observable nuclear DNA SSB. Use of permeabilized V79 and Hpr-4 cells exposed to H(2)O(2) showed that mitochondrial DNA SSB decreased when extramitochondrial Ca(2+) concentration increased. These findings indicate that elevated intracellular Ca(2+) concentration may protect against H(2)O(2)-induced mitochondrial damage and cytotoxicity in these cells.
