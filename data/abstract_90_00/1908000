The effect of dose scheduling on the pharmacodynamics of simulated human doses of ciprofloxacin (200 mg intravenously [iv] every 12 h) and azlocillin (4 g iv every 12 h) alone or in combination against Pseudomonas aeruginosa was studied in a two-compartment in vitro kinetic model of infection. Studies with the two drugs in combination were compared using simultaneous or staggered (first doses of each drug were administered 6 h apart) dosing schedules. Bacterial regrowth and resistance were prevented by all combination dosing schedules; however, the simultaneous regimen consistently provided the greatest extent of killing for all strains, particularly in those initially resistant to ciprofloxacin. These enhanced effects of the combination were corroborated by an increase in the peak and duration of bactericidal activity in the analogous "serum" compartment of the model. These data show the potential usefulness of simultaneous dosing of an antipseudomonal beta-lactam with ciprofloxacin against P. aeruginosa.
