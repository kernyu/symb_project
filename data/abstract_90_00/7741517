Resistance of human cytomegalovirus to approved antiviral drugs is becoming a problem of increasing concern. In order to further study drug resistance in a related virus, strains of murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) have been prepared in vitro by extensive adaptation of the virus to increasingly higher concentrations of either ganciclovir, foscarnet, or (S)-9-(3-hydroxy-2-[phosphonylmethoxy]propyl)cytosine (HPMPC). Plaque reduction 50% effective concentrations (EC50) for the above inhibitors increased 9-, 7-, and 23-fold, respectively (against the corresponding virus), compared to wild-type MCMV. Each virus was then evaluated against other known anti-MCMV agents to determine cross-resistance patterns. These compounds included 3-hydroxy-phosphonylmethoxypropyl derivatives of adenine (HPMPA) and guanine (HPMPG), 2-phosphonylmethoxyethyl derivatives of adenine (PMEA) and 2,6-diaminopurine (PMEDAP), cyclobutylguanine, acyclovir, and the methylene phosphonate derivatives of acyclovir (SR3722) and ganciclovir (SR3773). The ganciclovir-resistant MCMV was cross-resistant to foscarnet, HPMPA, HPMPC, HPMPG, SR3722, and SR3773. The foscarnet-resistant virus was also resistant to acyclovir, PMEA, PMEDAP, SR3722, and SR3773. The HPMPC-resistant MCMV was cross-resistant to HPMPA, HPMPG, and SR3773. Changes in susceptibility were from 3- to 22-fold relative to the wild-type virus. Virus yield reduction data correlated with the plaque assay results. Only cyclobutylguanine was approximately equally active against wild-type and the three drug-resistant MCMVs. The patterns of cross-resistance correlated with resistance seen in human cytomegalovirus strains expressing altered DNA polymerase function. The GCV-resistant and HPMPC-resistant viruses were markedly attenuated in their ability to kill severe combined immunodeficient mice.
