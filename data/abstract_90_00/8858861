A gene, designated aadA2 and encoding an aminoglycoside-adenylyltransferase, was located on integron InC, isolated from the R-plasmid of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, as a gene cassette. The aadA2 gene of InC was identical to those of pSa and R1033 with the exception of one base in each case. This single-base substitution did not influence the expression of streptomycin resistance. It is proposed that the aadA2 genes isolated from pSa and from R1033, and the aadA2 gene from InC, be designated aadA2a and aadA2b, respectively.
