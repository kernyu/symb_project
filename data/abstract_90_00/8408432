Analytical solutions for a mathematical model describing dynamic adsorption processes of proteins onto non-porous adsorbent particles in a finite bath are presented. The model, based on the Langmuir adsorption isotherm, has been applied to experimental data obtained with affinity and ion-exchange adsorbents. The external film mass transfer resistance, as well as the rate of surface interaction between proteins and adsorbents, have been taken into account. The model has been extended to the case of adsorption onto porous particles by employing a linear driving force approximation for describing mass transfer in the pore fluid. This approach enables the derivation of an effective overall liquid phase mass transfer coefficient, permitting subsequent adaptation of the analytical solutions developed for non-porous particles. The evaluation of the effective liquid phase mass transfer coefficients is also described. Examples of a comparison between predicted and experimental dynamic adsorption curves for both dye-affinity and ion-exchange systems are presented. The application of the model for predicting the optimum operating conditions is discussed.
