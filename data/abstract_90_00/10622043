Adefovir dipivoxil, an acyclic nucleotide phosphonate analogue, demonstrates a potent and sustained antiviral activity. Its long half-life allows once daily administration and due to the observed reduction in L-carnitine plasma levels, supplementation with L-carnitine is required. Clinical evidence indicates adefovir dipivoxil can be used as first-line therapy. In addition, due to the sensitivity of drug resistant strains to adefovir dipivoxil, it also has a role in second-line or multi-drug salvage regimens. Adefovir dipivoxil is safe and well tolerated for only short periods of treatment.
