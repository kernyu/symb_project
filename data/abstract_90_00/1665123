The in vitro activity of sparfloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, was assessed against 234 gram-positive bacterial isolates by agar dilution (10(4) CFU/spot). Sparfloxacin activity was compared with that of ciprofloxacin and five other antibiotics. Sparfloxacin was the most active drug tested against methicillin-sensitive and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and coagulase-negative staphylococci (MIC90, 0.125-0.25 mg/l). Sparfloxacin was also the most active drug tested against Enterococcus faecalis (MIC90, 1 mg/l) and showed equal activity against gentamicin-susceptible and gentamicin-resistant (MIC greater than 2,000 mg/l) enterococci. Sparfloxacin was the most active quinolone tested against Streptococcus pneumoniae and S. pyogenes (MIC90, 1 mg/l). Most Corynebacterium jeikeium showed exquisite susceptibility to sparfloxacin (MIC, 0.06-0.25 mg/l). For MRSA, time-kill curves showed sparfloxacin to be rapidly bactericidal at the MIC of the organism. Sparfloxacin showed greater and more sustained bactericidal activity than ciprofloxacin and vancomycin at 1x and 2x the MIC. Reduction in the activity of sparfloxacin occurred with decreased agar pH (from 7.0 to 6.0) and increased bacterial inoculum. Sparfloxacin showed superior activity compared to reference drugs against most gram-positive bacteria.
