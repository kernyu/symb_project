Exposure to cyclosporin A (CspA) increased laccase (lac-1) transcript accumulation in the chestnut blight fungus Cryphonectria parasitica. This response was suppressed by compounds that interfere with calcium-dependent signal transduction and by the presence of a virulence-attenuating mycovirus. CspA stimulated the accumulation of mRNA from a nonhomologous reporter fused to the lac-1 promoter, indicating that the increased transcript levels resulted from an increase in promoter activity. Based on the current model for the regulation of lac-1 transcription, these results suggest that CspA interferes with a negative regulatory pathway that normally constrains lac-1 promoter activity. Significantly, CspA did not stimulate lac-1 transcription in mutant strains deficient in CspA binding activity, directly demonstrating a requirement for the interaction of CspA and cyclophilin in the modulation of lac-1 transcription. Our results establish that CspA treatment can stimulate gene transcription and that cyclophilin is the cellular receptor that mediates this activity.
