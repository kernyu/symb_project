Interactions between clarithromycin and biofilms formed by Staphylococcus epidermidis were investigated by using a clarithromycin-resistant strain. Treatment of the colonization with a relatively low concentration of clarithromycin resulted in the eradication of slime-like structure and a decrease in the quantity of hexose. Another result was increased penetration of antibiotics through the biofilm of S. epidermidis.
