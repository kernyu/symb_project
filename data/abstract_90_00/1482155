Beige mice were inoculated intravenously with 10(7.90) CFU of Mycobacterium avium 101. Among the untreated control mice, when the mean CFU per spleen increased to a level greater than 10(8), small numbers of organisms resistant to clarithromycin (CLARI) were isolated from some of the spleens; the frequency of CLARI-resistant mutants was estimated to be between 10(-8) and 10(-9). In mice treated with 200 mg of CLARI per kg of body weight six times weekly, however, CLARI-resistant organisms were isolated from the spleens of all mice examined after treatment for 8 weeks; the mean CFU per spleen and the frequency of resistant mutants were significantly greater than those of control mice and increased further after treatment for 16 weeks. The MICs of CLARI against the resistant organisms isolated from both control and treated mice were > or = 512 micrograms/ml.
