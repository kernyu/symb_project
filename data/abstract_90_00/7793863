Malaysian, TGR (Thailand), and Gambian (West African) Plasmodium falciparum isolates were cultured in vitro by the candle jar method and were characterized for their susceptibilities to present antimalarial drugs by the modified in vitro microtechnique. Results showed that 93 and 47% of the Malaysian isolates were resistant at 50% inhibitory concentrations of 0.1415 to 0.7737 and 0.1025 to 0.1975 microM, respectively, while the rest were susceptible to choloroquine and cycloguanil at 0.0376 and 0.0306 to 0.0954 microM, respectively. All isolates were susceptible to mefloquine, quinine, and pyrimethamine at 0.0026 to 0.0172, 0.0062 to 0.0854, and 0.0149 to 0.0663 microM, respectively. In contrast, the Gambian isolate was susceptible to multiple drugs at 0.0024 to 0.0282 microM; TGR was resistant to chloroquine at 0.8147 microM but was susceptible to mefloquine, quinine, cycloguanil, and pyrimethamine at 0.0024, 0.0096, 0.0143, and 0.0495 microM, respectively.
