Anti-psychotic drugs are used in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy frequently and the concomitantly used drugs may alter the pharmacokinetics of each other. One reason for the alteration of pharmacokinetics may be the modulation of the function of P-glycoprotein, whose efflux pump occurs in resistant cancer cells, in human intestine and in the blood-brain barrier. For this reason we tested the effect of several anti-psychotic drugs on the multidrug-resistant pump, P-glycoprotein. We found that in the MDR gene transfected L121C MDR, L5178 MDR and in the KB-V-1 cells selected for resistance some antipsychotic drugs block the function of P-glycoprotein. Blood cells of two treatment-resistant leukemic patients also showed increased uptake of daunorubicin if treated ex vivo with the anti-psychotic drugs. Our results suggest that pharmacokinetic studies should be performed prior to concomitant clinical use of such drugs which block P-glycoprotein function.
