We have used a panel of bladder cancer cell lines to compare the toxicities of Adriamycin and epirubicin, two drugs used intravesically to treat superficial transitional cell cancer (TCC) of the bladder, alone and in combination with lonidamine, an agent known to be active against anthracycline-resistant disease. Comparing concentrations reducing colony-forming ability by 50%, epirubicin and Adriamycin were similar in their cytotoxicities, although epirubicin was more potent against every line except an Adriamycin-resistant subline. Combinations of the two drugs with a non-cytotoxic concentration (1 microgram/ml) of lonidamine were tested using the Adriamycin-resistant subline MGH-U1R and its sensitive parental line MGH-U1. The addition of lonidamine caused a two-fold increase in the sensitivity of the resistant subline to both drugs, while having no effect on the sensitivity of the parental line. The data indicate that this combination might be of value in anthracycline-resistant disease.
