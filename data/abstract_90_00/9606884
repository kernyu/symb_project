Due to its pathogenety Candida albicans is the most frequent yeast in cases of vaginal candidosis, probably mostly caused by local immunological weakness. In 5-30% one can expect a vaginal yeast colonisation depending on age, estrogen influence, pregnancy and dispositions by illness. Prepartal vaginal yeast colonisation should be treated to protect the newborn. The only typical symptom of acute vaginal candidosis is itching. Beside history and clinical symptoms, examination of vaginal secretion by phase contrast microscopy and the yeast culture are cornerstones of the diagnosis. Antimycotic resistance should be investigated only by specialists. Acute Candida albicans vaginitis should be treated locally by one or three day therapy. Candida glabrata vaginitis can be treated with high doses of oral fluconazole.
