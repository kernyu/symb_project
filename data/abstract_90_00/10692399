An interdomain hybrid Tet protein consisting of a class C alpha domain and a class B beta domain (Tet(C/B)) lacks detectable efflux ability and provides only minimal levels of resistance to tetracycline (Tc) (3 microg/ml) compared with intact class B (256 microg/ml) and class C (64 microg/ml). Twenty-one independently isolated mutants of the Tet(C/B) protein with increased Tc resistance were generated by random chemical mutagenesis. Nine mutants with a Glu substitution for Gly-152 in helix 5 of the class C alpha domain produced a resistance of 48 microg/ml, whereas another 9 with an Asp replacement of Gly-247 in helix 8 of the class B beta domain mediated resistance at 32 microg/ml. The third type of mutation, found in 3 mutants expressing 24 microg/ml resistance, was a S202F replacement in the putative interdomain cytoplasmic loop of Tet(C/B). The latter underscores a previously unappreciated function of the interdomain cytoplasmic loop. All three types of Tet(C/B) mutant proteins were expressed in amounts comparable with that of the original protein and demonstrated restored energy-dependent efflux of tetracycline. Site-directed mutational analysis demonstrated that a Gly-247 to Asn mutation could also facilitate Tc resistance by the Tet(C/B) hybrid, and a negatively charged side chain at position 152 was required for Tet(C/B) activity. These mutations appear to promote the necessary functional interactions between the interclass domains that do not occur in the Tet(C/B) hybrid protein and suggest a direct association between helix 5 and helix 8 in the function of Tet efflux proteins.
