The genes encoding the ParC and ParE subunits of topoisomerase IV of Streptococcus pneumoniae, together with the region encoding amino acids 46 to 172 (residue numbers are as in Escherichia coli) of the pneumococcal GyrA subunit, were partially characterized. The gyrA gene maps to a physical location distant from the gyrB and parC loci on the chromosome, whereas parC is closely linked to parE. Ciprofloxacin-resistant (Cpr) clinical isolates of S. pneumoniae had mutations affecting amino acid residues of the quinolone resistance-determining region of ParC (low-level Cpr) or in both quinolone resistance-determining regions of ParC and GyrA (high-level Cpr). Mutations were found in residue positions equivalent to the serine at position 83 and the aspartic acid at position 87 of the E. coli GyrA subunit. Transformation experiments suggest that ParC is the primary target of ciprofloxacin. Mutation in parC appears to be a prerequisite before mutations in gyrA can influence resistance levels.
