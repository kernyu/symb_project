A complex bacteriological approach to the problem of purulent cholangitis was applied. Specimens of bile from 140 patients, gallbladder walls from 106 patients, liver tissue from 93 patients and peritoneum tissue from 82 patients were examined. It was microbiologically shown that the infectious process in the patients with purulent cholangitis involved not only the bile and gallbladder walls but also the surrounding tissues of the liver and peritoneum. There was a correlation between the bile microflora and the microflora of the surrounding tissues. The microflora of the bile, gallbladder walls, liver and peritoneum tissues was characterized qualitatively and quantitatively. Sensitivity of 494 clinical isolates to 16 antimicrobial drugs was assayed. To prevent the postoperative complications, schemes for the antibacterial therapy were developed with an account of the aerobic and anaerobic spectra of the microbes disseminating the bile, gallbladder walls, liver and peritoneum.
