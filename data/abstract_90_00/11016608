It is suspected that the use of avoparcin as a feeding antibiotic for the fat stock contributes to development of cross-resistance against vancomycin and teicoplanin. After isolating enterococci strains from poultry and pork meat by cultivation on citrate azide Tween carbonate agar (CATC) and screening the vancomycin resistance on Columbia colistin nalidixic acid agar (CNA, supplemented with 5% sheepblood and 5 mg vancomycin/l) the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used for the detection of the vancomycin resistance genes vanA ('high level'), vanB ('moderate high level'), vanC1, vanC2 and vanC3 ('low level'). Out of 1643 E.-isolates from 115 poultry and 50 pork samples, 420 isolates could be identified as vancomycin resistant, 202 isolates of which carry the vanA, one isolate both the vanA and the vanC1, 38 isolates the vanC1, 14 isolates the vanC2, nine isolates both the vanC1 and the vanC3 gene and 156 isolates carry no gene. The vanB gene was not found in these isolates. Comparing vanA-positive food isolates with those from different human sources by means of the pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) it could clearly be demonstrated that they do not show homological fingerprints according to the source of origin. It is therefore unlikely that there is a close genetic relationship between isolates from animal foodstuff and humans.
