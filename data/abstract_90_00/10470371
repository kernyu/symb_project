Many anticancer agents are known to induce apoptosis in cultured cells, but human solid tumor cells are often resistant to apoptosis induction. Human pancreatic adenocarcinoma AsPC-1 cells were found to be resistant to apoptosis. So, we screened microbial culture filtrates and synthetic chemicals for their ability to induce apoptosis in AsPC-1 cells. Polyoxypeptin A was isolated from a Streptomyces culture broth as a potent inducer of apoptosis. Its cyclic hexadepsipeptide structure contains a simple but hitherto unreported amino acid, (2S,3R)-3-hydroxy-3-methylproline. Polyoxypeptin A induced early cell death, apoptotic morphology, and internucleosomal DNA fragmentation in AsPC-1 cells at low concentrations. Polyoxypeptin A can induce caspase 3 activation in human T cell leukemia Jurkat cells but not in AsPC-1 cells. The mechanism of apoptosis in AsPC-1 cells has not been elucidated yet. Less toxic derivatives of polyoxypeptin A are being prepared. A macrocyclic lactam called BE-14106 was also isolated from Streptomyces as an inducer of apoptosis in AsPC-1 cells. Histidine-pyridine-histidine-3 (HPH-3) is an oxygen-activating ligand derived from the structure of bleomycin, and it also induced apoptosis in AsPC-1 cells. Induction of apoptosis by HPH-3 was inhibited by zinc and copper ions, indicating that chelation with ferrous ion is responsible for induction of apoptosis, as is chelation by bleomycin to cleave DNA. Bleomycin A2 and its portion having no DNA-binding region, glycopeptide-3(GP-3), did not induce apoptosis in AsPC-1 cells. Thus, among the actions of bleomycin-related compounds, the induction of apoptosis is a unique characteristic of HPH-3.
