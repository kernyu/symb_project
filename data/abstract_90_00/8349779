Ramoplanin and mupirocin are two antimicrobial agents that may be applied topically. They had similar potencies against susceptible gram-positive cocci, but they differed in their spectra of activity. In plastic microdilution trays, the in vitro activity of ramoplanin was slightly diminished but that activity was restored by the addition of bovine serum albumin (0.02%). Susceptible strains were defined as those for which MICs of ramoplanin were < or = 2.0 micrograms/ml (without bovine serum albumin) and which had > or = 11-mm zones around 60-micrograms ramoplanin disks. Criteria for a resistant category cannot be defined at this time.
