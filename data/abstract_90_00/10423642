Serious skin and skin-structure infections may require parenteral antibiotic therapy. Such infections are generally polymicrobial, and they often involve both gram-positive and gram-negative aerobes as well as anaerobic bacteria. Effective treatment thus requires the use of a broad-spectrum antibiotic or combination therapy. The development of antibiotic resistance by clinically important pathogens has significantly increased the difficulty of treating skin and skin-structure infections. One of the major mechanisms of resistance observed in organisms likely to be associated with such infections is the development of beta-lactamases that inactivate beta-lactam antibiotics. Two approaches have been taken to combat this problem: the use of beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations and the development of beta-lactamase-stable drugs. Both strategies have resulted in treatments that are clinically and bacteriologically effective in patients with skin and skin-structure infections. The use of one beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combination, ampicillin/sulbactam, has been demonstrated to be more cost-effective than treatment with beta-lactamase-stable antibiotics, such as cefoxitin and imipenem/cilastatin, for this indication.
