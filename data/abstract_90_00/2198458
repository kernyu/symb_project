Haemophilus influenzae is a gram-negative rod, causing severe infections in childhood, including meningitis, sepsis, epiglottits, pneumonia and otitis. Most of the invasive infections are due to serotype b. Since ampicillin-resistance is increasing, modern cephalosporines like cefotaxime and ceftriaxone are the antibiotics of choice in severe disease. Bacterial meningitis due to Haemophilus influenzae and epiglottitis are both still life-threatening diseases with a lethality of 5% to 25%, and there are severe sequelae in 35% of meningitis cases. Efforts have been made to develop efficacious vaccines. While immunogenicity of type b polysaccharide was low in the high-risk age (below 18 months), conjugated vaccines with either diphtheria-toxoid or Neisseria meningitis outer membrane protein and the Hib polysaccharide were found to be strongly immunogenic even in the first months of life. These vaccines show every few side-effects and can easily be combined with other immunizations such as DPT and DT. Thus, the incidence of invasive infections due to Haemophilus influenzae type b might decline in future.
