Sexually active travelers are at risk for a variety of STDs, including traditional venereal infections such as gonorrhea, chlamydial urethritis, syphilis, chancroid, and herpes simplex infection. More recently, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and HIV-1 have also been described. Risk varies depending on the geographic area of travel and the type of sexual contact. Physicians should be aware of the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance of N. gonorrhoeae and H. ducreyi because this will affect empiric antibiotic therapy. Prevention should focus on proper and consistent usage of barrier contraceptives.
