A total of 122 Streptococcus suis serotype 2 strains were characterized thoroughly by comparing clinical and pathological observations, ribotype profiles, and antimicrobial resistance. Twenty-one different ribotype profiles were found and compared by cluster analysis, resulting in the identification of three ribotype clusters. A total of 58% of all strains investigated were of two ribotypes belonging to different ribotype clusters. A remarkable relationship existed between the observed ribotype profiles and the clinical-pathological observations because strains of one of the two dominant ribotypes were almost exclusively isolated from pigs with meningitis, while strains of the other dominant ribotype were never associated with meningitis. This second ribotype was isolated only from pigs with pneumonia, endocarditis, pericarditis, or septicemia. Cluster analysis revealed that strains belonging to the same ribotype cluster as one of the dominant ribotypes came from pigs that showed clinical signs similar to those of pigs infected with strains with the respective dominant ribotype profiles. Furthermore, strains belonging to different ribotype clusters had totally different patterns of resistance to antibiotics because strains isolated from pigs with meningitis were resistant to sulfamethazoxazole and strains isolated from pigs with pneumonia, endocarditis, pericarditis, or septicemia were resistant to tetracycline.
