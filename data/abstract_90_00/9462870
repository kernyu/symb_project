Candida sake is routinely identified in the oral cavity of patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) using the commercial identification system ATB 32 C. To establish the prevalence of C. sake and to evaluate this designation repeatedly found using the ATB 32 C system, 94 HIV-infected patients were investigated for the presence of oral candidosis based on clinical and microbiological grounds. A total of 186 Candida isolates from 62 patients were obtained. Using the assimilation assay, C. sake was suspected in 49 isolates, but only seven strains were positively identified according to ATB 32 C. With respect to antifungal susceptibility and clinical parameters the 49 strains did not differ markedly from the other strains. Only antifungal susceptibility to amphotericin B, ketoconazole, and flucytosine was increased in C. sake strains when the positively and equivocally identified strains by ATB 32 C were taken together. In addition, amplifying genomic DNA with primers T3B and AP3, C. sake could not be identified in four strains and in one strain, respectively. Therefore biochemical identification of C. sake seems to be misleading and clinical relevance may be lacking.
