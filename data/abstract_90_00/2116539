A specific protein (MW 18,000) was found using chloramphenicol (CP) base-affinity chromatography of periplasmic-space proteins obtained from an impermeability-type CP-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa harboring plasmid kR102. Membrane reconstitution experiments using a liposome system appeared to indicate that the permeability of CP was inhibited by the specific protein.
