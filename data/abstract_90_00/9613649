BACKGROUND: In view of the widespread use of penicillin for >50 years for the treatment of group A streptococcal infections, we examined the question of whether there has been a change in susceptibility to penicillin in group A streptococcal strains collected during a span of 80 years (1917 to 1997). METHODS: One hundred thirty-three group A streptococcal strains collected during 80 years were tested for changes in penicillin susceptibility. Three tests were used: (1) the microtiter broth minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC); (2) the minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC); and (3) the penicillin E strip MIC. RESULTS: The results indicate there has been no change in the susceptibility to penicillin in these group A streptococci during the past 80 years. The microtiter broth MIC90 for the oldest strains (0.032 microg/ml) was not significantly different from those collected most recently (0.032 microg/ml); there is no statistical difference between the raw MIC data for the four collection periods (P=0.468, analysis of variance on ranks). CONCLUSIONS: There has been no change in the susceptibility of group A streptococci during this time in spite of well-documented cases of penicillin resistance in other Gram-positive organisms and despite recognized resistance of group A streptococci to other antibiotics.
