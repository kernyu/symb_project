Forty-eight vancomycin-resistant and 35 vancomycin-sensitive Danish Enterococcus faecium isolates obtained from pigs, chickens and humans, as well as the human vanA reference isolate BM4147, were characterized by EcoRI RiboPrinting and SmaI pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. RiboPrinting of the 84 isolates yielded 40 types whereas PFGE-typing yielded 57 types discriminated by differences in more than three bands. By molecular typing, both clonal spread of E. faecium as well as horizontal transmission of Tn1546 between animals and humans was supported. Furthermore, it was found that the population of E. faecium spreads freely between the animal and human reservoir.
