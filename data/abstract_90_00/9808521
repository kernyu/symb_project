A search for serum factors that modulate the mutability of human cells has been attempted in the peripheral blood of lung cancer patients. Factors were separated by dye-ligand chromatography and first identified as those exhibiting the ability to enhance the frequency of drug-resistance mutations in human RSa cells. The frequency was assessed by estimation of the cloning efficiency of mutant cells resistant to ouabain-mediated cell killing (OuaR) after irradiation with far-ultraviolet light (UV, mainly 254-nm wavelength). Pre-culture of cells with medium containing the factors prior to UV irradiation led to about a 19- to 37-fold increase in the OuaR mutation frequency compared with that of cells irradiated but not treated with the factors. The enhancing activity was detected in the serum of all 7 lung cancer patients, although the serum itself, which had not been treated with chromatography, had little or no enhancing activity in all patients. No enhancing activity was detected in serum preparations from healthy donors. The enhancing activity of lung cancer serum factors on UV-induced mutagenicity was next confirmed by detecting an enhancement of K-ras codon 12 base substitution mutations in human RSb cells, as analyzed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and differential dot-blot hybridization. Our results, together with previous findings on suppression of mutagen-induced mutagenicity by human interferons, suggest the existence of extracellular factors that modulate the mutability of human cells.
