Studies of the molecular aspects of resistance of influenza virus A to drugs (rimantadine, deytiforine, amantadine) allow a purposeful design of new compounds with a broad spectrum of antiviral activity and evoking no resistance. In this work the nucleotide sequence of rimantadine- and deytiforine-resistant influenza A strain Leningrad/156/83 (H3N2) was compared with that of A/Victoria/35/72. The influence of aminoacid substitutions in the M2 protein on its secondary structure in the membrane and its role in resistance development was shown.
