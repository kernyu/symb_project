Clinical and experimental studies examining the action of IFNs on human malignant melanomas and melanoma cell lines have shown that this cancer cell type is frequently IFN resistant. In the present study, the IFN responsiveness of five melanoma cell lines, SK-MEL-28, SK-MEL-3, MM96, HT-144, and Hs 294T, as determined by the levels of IFN-induced expression of the antiviral proteins, 100 kDa 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS) and Mx Ag, was shown to correlate with the IFN responsiveness of the five lines measured in antiproliferative and antiviral assays. Three of the lines, SK-MEL-28 (IFN sensitive), SK-MEL-3 (moderately IFN sensitive), and MM96 (IFN insensitive) were analyzed further to ascertain their relative levels of IFN-activated signal transduction. Pretreatment of the three melanoma cell lines with the tyrosine kinase inhibitors, Herbimycin A or Genistein, produced a dose-dependent inhibition of the antiviral action of IFN-alpha, -beta, and -gamma and the induction of OAS by IFN-beta. Thus, induction of the antiviral state in melanoma cells by IFN requires activation of tyrosine kinase-dependent signaling pathways. Furthermore, the IFN responsiveness of three melanoma cell lines could be correlated with the ability to detect by immunoblotting of SDS-PAGE displays of cell lysates, IFN-induced tyrosine phosphorylated cellular proteins in the range m.w. 80 to 130 kDa. This induction was also sensitive to the tyrosine kinase inhibitors Herbimycin A and Genistein. Based on these results, we propose that the IFN-resistant melanoma cell lines examined contain a deficiency early in the IFN signal transduction pathway resulting in a reduced potential for IFN-induced tyrosine phosphorylation and a lack of responsiveness to IFN.
