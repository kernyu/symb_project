A simple modification of the commercially available Sweetana-Grass (S-G) side-by-side diffusion cells, allowing the simultaneous measurement of tissue permeability and transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER), has been described and validated for rat excised, muscle-free intestinal tissue. The TEER-lowering effects of a series of acylcarnitines were shown to be correlated with previously reported in vitro (i.e., membrane perturbation) and in vivo (i.e., absorption enhancement) activity. The TEER-lowering effect of palmitoyl carnitine chloride (PCC) was also shown to be reversible. The effects of PCC on TEER and the permeability of poorly absorbed compounds (cefoxitin and lucifer yellow) were simultaneously determined. Compared to controls (mannitol-treated), PCC immediately produced a rapid drop in colon TEER. By 5 min post-PCC addition, colon TEER was 50% of control; by 10 min post-PCC addition, colon TEER was 17% of control. After a lag of about 5-10 min post-PCC addition, the cefoxitin or lucifer yellow permeability coefficient increased more than 20-fold. The modified S-G cells provide a simple and reproducible method whereby flux and TEER can be simultaneously determined, providing a valuable link between the effect of absorption enhancers on TEER measurements and the increased permeability of poorly absorbed compounds.
