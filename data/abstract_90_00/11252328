A flow cytofluorometric susceptibility test (FCST) was used for rapid determination of the susceptibility of Candida lusitaniae isolates to amphotericin B. The test is based on the decrease in fluorescence intensity of cells stained with 3,3'-dipentyloxacarbocyanine iodide (DiOC5(3)), a membrane potential-sensitive cationic dye, after drug treatment. A total of 58 C. lusitaniae clinical isolates including strains known to be amphotericin B-resistant on the basis of in-vivo and/or in-vitro data were tested. MICs were determined concurrently by the NCCLS broth macrodilution method and the Etest, both with antibiotic medium 3. Regression analysis demonstrated that the data from the FCST and the Etest were better correlated (r = 0.93, n = 59, P < 0.001) than those from the FCST and the NCCLS method (r = 0.63, n = 59, P < 0.001). The FCST readily identified a series of putatively susceptible and resistant isolates. Our study points out the advantages of the flow cytometry approach in antifungal susceptibility testing of yeasts, since speed remains a major problem in conventional tests.
