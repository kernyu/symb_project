The broad antimicrobial spectrum of Fleroxacin RO 23-6240 was tested on a panel of bacterial and several mycobacterial species. Staph. aureus strains, gramnegative bacteria E. coli, Kl. pneumoniae, Salmonella spp. were found to be rather susceptible to the tested preparation in vitro. The same was true of those species which are known to feature strong natural resistance, e.g. Ps. aeruginosa and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. As regards mycobacteria, complete susceptibility was recorded for 10 M. tuberculosis strains, 17 M. kansasii strains and 4 strains of M. fortuitum. Only two of the eleven tested strains of the complex M. avium-intracellulare were found to be susceptible and one M. chelonae strain tested proved resistant. Due to their broad spectrum and strong bactericidal effects, chinolone preparations can be anticipated to assume an everincreasing significance in the future.
