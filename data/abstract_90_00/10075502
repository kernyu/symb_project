In contrast to other eukaryotic cells the pathogenic yeast Candida albicans is resistant to many structurally unrelated metabolic inhibitors. Reduced permeability due to the cell wall and/or altered plasma membrane composition is thought to be at least partly responsible for this phenomenon. To study the uptake of low molecular weight compounds into C. albicans we developed a dual labelling method. Intact cells, metabolically inactivated cells, spheroplasts or membrane fragments of C. albicans were incubated with various [14C]-labelled compound in the presence of [3H]-labelled water. After separation of cells and supernatant isotope ratios [3H]/[14C] were determined. Quotients of the isotope ratios from cells and supernatant, called enrichment coefficients, were calculated under all four conditions. The enrichment coefficients indicated whether a compound can enter C. albicans cells, is trapped within the cell wall, is enriched in the lipophilic membrane compartment, is actively accumulated or actively exported by multidrug resistance carriers. We used six structurally unrelated compounds to test our method. We found no evidence for a general impermeability of C. albicans.
