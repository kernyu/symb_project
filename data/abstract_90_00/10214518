Self-treatment of malaria with chloroquine is extremely common in West Africa for the febrile attacks self-diagnosed as a presumed malaria case. A survey was conducted for one year in Niamey to assess the importance of the self-treatment practice. Transmission of malaria is permanent along the river banks and seasonal in some suburbs. Chloroquine is made available by local ambulatory sellers. A sample of 199 persons purchase on average four tablets each which is less than the curative dose recommended by WHO. Self-medication is an adequate practice for reaching the primary goal of malaria strategy in sub-Saharan Africa, i.e. to reduce morbidity and mortality through prompt therapy. Developing this practice is a top public health priority. Even if the dose is not appropriate, self-medication protects against serious attacks without preventing immunization and does not seem to induce greater risk of extension of chloroquine-resistance.
