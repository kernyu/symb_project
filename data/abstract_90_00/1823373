Species classification of 39 strains of Acinetobacter isolated from urinary tract infections (UTI) was performed by API 20NE tests. On the whole 24 biotypes were differentiated which formed 4 species and one biotype had no defined species classification. Acinetobacter baumani was most numerously represented. Seventy seven percent of strains were isolated from urine samples from women. About 90% of Acinetobacter strains were isolated as single pathogens. Sensitivity of these strains to 23 antibiotics and chemotherapeutics using ATB-UR and disc diffusion technique was evaluated. Of all cephalosporins tested ceftazidime was the most active. All strains tested were sensitive to imepenem. The high percentage of strains was sensitive to quinolones of IIIrd generation. The high percentage of strains was resistant to nitrofurantoin.
