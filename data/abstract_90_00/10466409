A study was carried out to assess the stability of antimicrobial susceptibility of wild isolates upon long-term storage using fifty-three Escherichia coli strains isolated in 1978 from feces of healthy children from the Amazon region in Brazil, exposed to low levels of antimicrobial agents, and examined for resistance to mercury and four antibiotics. All of the strains were kept in Lignieres medium at room temperature and were transferred to fresh media four times during this period. Thirty-five out of the 53 strains analyzed in 1978 were viable. Upon recovery, antibiotic and mercury resistance was estimated. All of the 35 strains maintained their original phenotype in a stable fashion, except for one multiresistant strain which became susceptible to kanamycin. Fifty-four percent of the strains exhibited a resistance phenotype, among which 47% had conjugative plasmids.
