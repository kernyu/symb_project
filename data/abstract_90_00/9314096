We have developed an homogeneous assay to measure the uptake and efflux of [14C]adriamycin (doxorubicin hydrochloride) in human squamous lung carcinoma cells (SKMES-1), using 96 well scintillating microplates. The assay was also used to examine the effect of inhibitors of multidrug resistance in adriamycin resistant cells (SKMES-1/ADR). The effect of adriamycin on cell growth and viability was examined by continuous monitoring of the uptake of [14C]thymidine. The non-invasive nature of these assays, and the ease of use of the microplates, suggests a role in screens for, and characterisation of, novel chemotherapeutic or chemosensitizing agents.
