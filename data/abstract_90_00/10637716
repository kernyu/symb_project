The emergence of penicillin-nonsusceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae (PNSSP) has brought a new clinical challenge. In Taiwan, reports of the prevalence and clinical features of PNSSP infections in children are limited. This study reviewed the resistance patterns of all clinical isolates of S. pneumoniae obtained from patients under 17 years of age from January 1993 through July 1998 in a medical center. Their clinical features and treatment responses were analyzed, with special attention paid to those patients with invasive PNSSP infections. Totally, 170 clinical isolates of S. pneumoniae were obtained from 168 patients aged under 17 years. Among those infections, there were 56 sinusitis (including 4 sinusitis with bacteremia), 44 pneumonia (including 23 pneumonia with bacteremia or empyema), 23 otitis media (including 5 otitis media with bacteremia), 9 simple bacteremia, 9 conjunctivitis, 8 meningitis, 4 peritonitis, 3 skin infections and the other 14 isolates were colonization. One hundred eleven isolates (65.3%) showed reduced penicillin susceptibility by the disk diffusion method. A trend of increasing percentiles of PRSP was noted: 27.3% (3/11) in 1993, 37.5% (9/24) in 1994, 55.5% (10/18) in 1995, 77.5% (31/40) in 1996, 66.0% (31/47) in 1997, and 87.1% (27/31) in 1998. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) determinations by the E-test showed some of the isolates were intermediately resistant. Prior antibiotic usage was associated with a higher incidence of PNSSP infections. However, most children responded well to antimicrobial treatment.
