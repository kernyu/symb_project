The aim of antibiotic therapy is pathogen eradication, which is often assumed on the basis of the alleviation of the signs and symptoms of the disease. Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic in vitro and animal models have now been developed to predict bacteriological efficacy and to establish dosing regimens that are effective and control the development of resistance. These models may be applied to the evaluation of new short-course dosing regimens, lasting no longer than 3 - 5 days. Single-dose therapy, using agents with a prolonged duration of action, is currently employed for streptococcal pharyngitis, uncomplicated gonorrhoea and uncomplicated lower urinary tract infections in women. The use of short-course therapy in immunocompetent patients for the treatment of community-acquired infections that have a low bacterial load is feasible. Such regimens may have a number of advantages over those currently employed, which typically involve dosing for 7 - 10 days. These advantages include improved tolerability, reduction in healthcare costs, enhanced patient compliance and the prevention of the emergence of resistance.
