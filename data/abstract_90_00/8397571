Candida lusitaniae is emerging as an opportunistic pathogen in premature infants. Treatment of C. lusitaniae is challenging due to frequent resistance of this organism to antifungal agents and lack of standardized susceptibility testing for fungi. We report the case of a premature infant with C. lusitaniae osteomyelitis in whom treatment was successful with 5-fluorocytosine and fluconazole.
