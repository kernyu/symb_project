The paper characterizes nontuberculosis mycobacteria (NTMB) by their species, shows the structure of mycobacteriasis pathogens, drug sensibility in NTMB and the degree of their virulence for laboratory animals. The specific proportion of NTMB is Mycobacterium avium (50.8%). A total of 136 cases of mycobacterium infection were examined. As high as 20.7% of isolates from mycobacteriasis patients have been found to have a high natural resistance to most antibacterial drugs. A combination of kanamycin, ethionamide, and ethambutol is the most effective in the treatment, additionally aminoglucosides--amikacin, gentamicin, sulfamides, such as biseptol, sulfadimethoxin, as well as the quinolones ciptobay and tarivid.
