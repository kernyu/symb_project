Of 7058 Vibrio cholerae strains recovered from patients suspected of cholera in the State of Ceara between December 1991 and September 1993, two were resistant to antimicrobials (Ampicillin, erythromycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, tetracycline) and to vibriostatic agent O/129 (2,4-diamino-6,7-diisopropylpteridine). From the bacteriological standpoint, one strain was identified as V. cholerae serogroup O:1, biotype El Tor, serovar Inaba, and another as V. cholerae serogroup O:22, biochemically classified as Heiberg type II. It was shown that only in the serogroup O:1 strain, multiple resistance was encoded by a plasmid transferrable by conjugation to Escherichia coli K12 and a sensitive strains of V. cholerae O1 and non-O1, with at a frequency between 8 x 10(-2) and 5 x 10(-6). The plasmid, with a molecular weight of 147 Kb, encoded both multiple resistance to antimicrobials and the vibriostatic compound (O/129), compatible with descriptions reported in other parts of world.
