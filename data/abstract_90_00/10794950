The occurrence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in food animals is a major public health threat. Information on the prevalence of resistance to specific drugs in both bacterial and animal species together with changes occurring over time, are necessary to understand the magnitude of the problem and to establish baselines for taking action. The aim of this paper is to define the minimum epidemiological and microbiological requirements for establishing a surveillance of antimicrobial resistance in bacteria of animal origin. Surveillance should involve different bacterial species, veterinary pathogens, zoonotic bacteria and commensal bacteria used as indicators. The collected data should be periodically updated and the reports distributed among practising veterinarians and regulatory authorities. These reports would be a useful tool for developing guidelines for the prudent use of antimicrobial agents in veterinary medicine and for action strategies.
