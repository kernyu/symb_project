The increased use of antimicrobials in farming, together with the practice of raw sewage discharge into receiving waters, has resulted in a significant increase in the numbers of antibiotic resistant bacteria present in aquatic environments. The role of this environment to act, not only as a reservoir of clinical resistance genes, but also as a medium for the spread and evolution of resistance genes and their vectors, is discussed.
