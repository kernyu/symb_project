All filariae examined to date express a comprehensive repertoire of both cytoplasmic and secreted anti-oxidant enzymes, although significant differences exist between species and life-cycle stages. Adult Brugia malayi, Dirofilaria immitis and Onchocerca volvulus secrete CuZn superoxide dismutases, and the former two species also secrete a selenocysteine-independent glutathione peroxidase. This enzyme has been localised to the cuticular matrix of B. malayi, and the preferential reduction of fatty acid- and phospholipid hydroperoxides suggests that it may protect cuticular membranes from oxidative damage rather than directly metabolise hydrogen peroxide. Adult O. volvulus may compensate for an apparent deficiency in expression of this enzyme via a secreted variant of glutathione S-transferase. Recent studies have identified a highly expressed family of enzymes collectively termed peroxiredoxins, which most probably play an essential role in reduction of hydroperoxides. Data from cDNA cloning exercises indicate that all filarial species examined thus far express at least two peroxiredoxin variants which have been localised to diverse tissues. In-vitro studies have shown that B. malayi are particularly resistant to oxidative stress, and that the parasites do not rely solely on enzymatic mechanisms of defence. Cuticular lipids are relatively resistant to lipid peroxidation due to the low unsaturation indices of the constituent fatty acyl residues, but complete protection is afforded by the presence of alpha-tocopherol, presumably assimilated from host extracellular fluids. Brugia malayi are also relatively resistant to nitric oxide-mediated toxicity, and this may be due in part to incomplete dependence on aerobic metabolism. Little is known of potential mechanisms for detoxification of nitric oxide derivatives and adaptive responses to oxidative stress in general, and these represent goals for future research.
