The aerobic intestinal microflora of 2-week-old herring (Clupea harengus) larvae was characterized by using conventional microbiological methods and electron microscopy. Larvae were hatched and kept in filtered seawater or in seawater with penicillin and streptomycin. The gastrointestinal tract of herring larvae is essentially a straight tube divided into two compartments. Light microscopy revealed bacteria present in a progressively increasing amount throughout the length of the gastrointestinal tract from esophagus to anus. The posterior region of the intestinal lumen appeared completely occluded with bacteria. The intestinal microflora consisted mainly of members of the genera Pseudomonas and Alteromonas in the larvae incubated in filtered seawater, whereas Flavobacterium spp. dominated in larvae exposed to antibiotics. The intestinal microflora of untreated fish larvae was sensitive to all tested antibiotics, whereas multiple resistance was found in the intestinal microflora of the group given antibiotics. Thus, a dramatic change in the microflora resulted from incubation with antibiotics. Nonpigmented yeasts were detected in both larval groups. Ciliated epithelial cells were observed in the midgut, probably propeling bacteria towards the hindgut, where endocytosis of bacteria has been demonstrated. These findings suggest that transport and sequestering mechanisms resembling those of invertebrates may be found in the gut of fish larvae. The possible significance for larval health and nutrition is discussed.
