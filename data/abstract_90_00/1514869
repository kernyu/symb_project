It was found possible to use organic sorbents and in particular carboxylic cationites for isolation of nisin from the fermentation broth filtrate and its purification. Nisin is known as a polypeptide antibiotic applied as a preservative. The sorbents were shown to have high exchange capacities by the isolated substance and mechanical strength and resistance. They also proved to be highly stable.
