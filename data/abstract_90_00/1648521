Defects in insulin receptor function lead to impairment of the insulin response. We treated a patient with the typical phenotype of type A syndrome of insulin resistance whose insulin receptor seemed to lack the transmembrane region and cytoplasmic domain. Hyperinsulinaemia and resistance to exogenous insulin were evident, and insulin binding to cells and uptake of 2-deoxyglucose into fibroblasts were greatly decreased. Molecular weight of the alpha-subunit of the insulin receptor was normal, but autophosphorylation and kinase activity were impaired. In the pedigree analysis, defects in insulin binding were also observed in the mother, maternal grandfather and two maternal aunts, corresponding with the abnormality of the insulin receptor gene and mild insulin resistance. In the mother, much the same kinase defects as were seen in the patient became evident. However, no relatives had clinical symptoms similar to those seen in the patient. In the father there was a mild insulin resistance in the glucose clamp study and a borderline impaired glucose tolerance. Although insulin binding to cells was normal in the father, both autophosphorylation and kinase activity were reduced. Our findings suggest that insulin resistance in the patient may be caused by the defects in insulin receptor kinase activity as well as by a reduction in insulin binding activity.
