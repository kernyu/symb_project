From August 1988 to January 1990, a total of 13,193 urine specimens were collected from inpatients and outpatients of Qatif Central Hospital, located in the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia, to determine the incidence of significant bacteriuria, causative microorganisms, and antimicrobial susceptibility. Among these, 1004 specimens (7.6%) showed significant bacteriuria. In community-acquired cases of bacteriuria, the prevalence was greater in female than in male patients. The most common organisms isolated were Escherichia coli and Klebsiella-Enterobacter species. Antimicrobial susceptibility showed high resistance to ampicillin, and therefore we suggest that norfloxacin be considered in empherical therapy, particularly in suspected cases of Pseudomonas urinary tract infections. For patients with an indwelling catheter, it is important to differentiate between colonization and infection before initiating antimicrobial therapy. The difficulties in treating urinary tract infections in patients with an indwelling catheter emphasize the importance of preventive measures.
