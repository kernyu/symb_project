Abacavir is a nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitor that inhibits clinical isolates of HIV in vitro with a potency similar to that of zidovudine. Resistance to abacavir develops relatively slowly. Cross-resistance between abacavir and didanosine, zalcitabine or lamivudine, but not zidovudine or stavudine, has been reported in vitro. Abacavir has good oral bioavailability, as demonstrated in animals, and penetrates the CNS. Treatment with abacavir, alone or in combination with other anti-HIV agents (zidovudine, lamivudine, nevirapine, amprenavir and/or other protease inhibitors), decreased viral load and increased CD4+ cell count in patients with HIV infection. Effectiveness was maintained for at least 48 weeks. In early phase I/II trials, headache, gastrointestinal disturbances, rash, malaise, fatigue and/or asthenia were the most common adverse events reported with abacavir alone or in combination with other anti-HIV agents. Hypersensitivity reactions lead to discontinuation of therapy in 2 to 3% of patients.
