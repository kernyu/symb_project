Parasitic helminths (worms) cause serious infectious diseases in humans and animals. As control of these infections relies mostly on chemotherapeutics, the anthelmintics, resistance has developed against most of these drugs in several parasite species. These resistant parasites are being used to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of drug action.
