A study was conducted on 40 Mycobacterium fortuitum strains isolated from symptomatic patients suffering from respiratory diseases and skin lesions. Their susceptibility to different antimicrobial agents was determined by the broth microdilution method, measuring minimal inhibitory concentration. There was sensitivity of the strains to gentamicin and tetracycline as well as resistance to the tuberculostatic drugs used (isoniazid and ethambutol) and cefalotin.
