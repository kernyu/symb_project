133 homeless subjects with pulmonary tuberculosis were examined microbiologically in Moscow Tuberculosis Hospital N 7 in 1993-1994. In most of the examinees the disease was advanced with destruction and intensive bacterial discharge (100-10,000 microbes in the sample). New-onset cases discharged mycobacteria with multiple drug resistance. Acquired drug resistance was registered in 83.8% of previously treated patients, 73% of them had resistance to 2-6 drugs. Isoniazid-, rifampicin- and streptomycin- resistant were 48.6, 33.8 and 63.5% of the examinees, respectively.
