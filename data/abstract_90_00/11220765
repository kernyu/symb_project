The spread of chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium vivax from Papua New Guinea and Indonesia poses a serious health threat to areas of Southeast Asia where this species of malaria parasite is endemic. A strain of P. vivax from Indonesia was adapted to develop in splenectomized Aotus lemurinus griseimembra, Aotus vociferans, Aotus nancymai, and Saimiri boliviensis monkeys. Transmission to splenectomized Saimiri monkeys was obtained via sporozoites. Chemotherapeutic studies indicated that the strain was resistant to chloroquine and amodiaquine while sensitive to mefloquine. Infections of chloroquine-resistant P.vivax in New World monkeys should be useful for the development of alternative treatments.
