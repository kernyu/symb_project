The resistance of polyribonucleotide inductors of interferon to blood ribonucleases was studied. Blood resistance of larifan and ridostin in the free and shielded state as well as that of the complexes of poly(I)-poly(C) and poly(G)-poly(C) were also investigated. A protective action of polylysine against the inductors was detected which, in case it had no effect on the biological activity of the drugs, could provide its recommendation as a compound for shielding the inductors.
