Cytomegalovirus strains with reduced in vitro susceptibilities to ganciclovir have been recovered from patients who failed long-term ganciclovir therapy. The ganciclovir-resistant clinical isolates in this study were unable to induce ganciclovir phosphorylation in virus-infected cells. The viral DNA polymerase function appeared unaltered in one genetically pure ganciclovir-resistant strain, compared with that of its wild-type ganciclovir-sensitive counterpart. All nine of the ganciclovir-resistant strains were susceptible to foscarnet. Moreover, these strains were sensitive to inhibition both by vidarabine and 1-(2'-deoxy-2'-fluoro-beta-D-arabinofuranosyl)-5-iodocytosine (FIAC), antiviral agents that are activated by cellular enzymes, and by (S)-1(3-hydroxy-2-phosphonylmethoxypropyl)cytosine (HPMPC), which is a monophosphate nucleoside analog. The in vitro resistance to ganciclovir of the ganciclovir-resistant clinical isolates studied was attributed to the inability of the cells infected with these isolates to phosphorylate ganciclovir; the virally encoded DNA polymerase did not appear to play a role in this ganciclovir resistance.
