Melioidosis is endemic in Malaysia. Emerging resistance with new and current antimicrobial agents has underscored the need to look further for new antimicrobial agents for the treatment of melioidosis. Hence, we evaluated the in-vitro susceptibility of fifty locally isolated strains of Burkholderia pseudomallei, the causative agent of melioidosis to cefoperazone-sulbactam combination using the method of NCCLS. All the fifty strains tested were susceptible in-vitro to cefoperazone-sulbactam. The MIC90 of the organism for cefoperazone-sulbactam was 4 mg/L. The results of our findings suggested that cefoperazone-sulbactam may be useful in the treatment of melioidosis.
