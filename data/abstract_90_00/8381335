We present here the first report of a transformation system developed for the filamentous, ML-236B (compactin)-producing fungus Penicillium citrinum. Hygromycin B-resistant colonies were obtained after treatment of protoplasts with a vector containing an Escherichia coli hygromycin B phosphotransferase gene fused to a 3-phosphoglycerate kinase promoter from Aspergillus nidulans. The transformation rate was 194 transformants per microgram circular DNA per 4 x 10(5) viable protoplasts under optimized transformation conditions. Transformation took place via the integration of plasmid DNA into the fungal chromosomal DNA. Most of the integration events appeared to produce tandemly iterated arrays of plasmid molecules at different sites in the chromosome. The transformed, drug-resistant, phenotype and the integrated plasmids were mitotically stable with or without selection in a majority of cases. The demonstration of such a transformation system is an essential first step in the application of recombinant DNA technology to strain improvement and for the production of novel ML-236B derivatives.
