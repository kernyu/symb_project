The presence of KatG(S315T), a mutation frequently detected in clinical isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, has been associated with loss of catalase-peroxidase activity and resistance to isoniazid therapy. Wild-type KatG and KatG(S315T) were expressed in a heterologous host (Escherichia coli) and purified to homogeneity, and enzymatic activity was measured. The catalase activity for KatG(S315T) was reduced 6-fold, and its peroxidase activity was decreased <2-fold, compared with the activities for wild-type KatG. Pyridine hemochrome analysis demonstrated 1.1 +/- 0.1 hemes/subunit for wild-type KatG and 0.9 +/- 0.1 hemes/subunit for KatG(S315T), indicating that the difference in enzymatic activity is not the result of incomplete heme cofactor incorporation in KatG(S315T). High-performance liquid chromatography analysis showed that wild-type KatG was more efficient than KatG(S315T) at converting isoniazid to isonicotinic acid. These results demonstrate that KatG(S315T), as expressed in E. coli, is a competent catalase-peroxidase that exhibits a reduced ability to metabolize isoniazid.
