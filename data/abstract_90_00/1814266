An antimicrobial substance was isolated from the culture fluid of Vibrio fischeri belonging to ++gram-negative sea bacteria. The substance was shown to be highly active against ++gram-positive cocci and less active against some other ++gram-positive bacteria and fungi. The active substance was defined as a low molecular weight compound which appeared to be thermostable and had positive ninhydrin reaction. The antibiotic formed when the culture was grown in the media containing sea water and protein hydrolysates or yeast extract during the exponential phase. The maximum antibiotic activity was observed during the stationary phase of culture development.
