A 38-year-old woman infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) presented with persistent oral candidosis in which non-albicans Candida strains were the predominant yeasts in most of the examinations performed over a period of 6 years. Oral treatment with fluconazole had no effect on clinical signs of oral candidosis. In 8 of a total of 11 specimens, Candida glabrata, Candida parapsilosis and Candida tropicalis were at least suspected as the causative pathogens of oral candidosis. The non-response to fluconazole in our patient could be explained by in vitro resistance to fluconazole of detected Candida glabrata and Candida tropicalis isolates.
