To remove endotoxin directly from the blood, an affinity adsorbent (PMX) has been developed. PMX is composed of a ligand of polymyxin B and a carrier of polystyrene fibers. We treated 16 patients, suffering from septic shock or multiple organ failure by PMX-F hemoperfusion. The pretreatment level of endotoxin decreased significantly from 80pg/ml to 21pg/ml on average 2 hours after the hemoperfusion. The hyperdynamic status in the cardiac index and the decreased systemic vascular resistance, which are characteristic to endotoxin shock, were normalized after the treatment. In septic shock patients with systolic pressure under 10mmHg, the systolic pressure increased significantly from pretreatment level. Nine of the sixteen patients remained alive for two weeks after the therapy, and seven out of the nine patients discharged alive. Hemoperfusion with PMX is likely to become an effective treatment for sepsis and septic shock.
