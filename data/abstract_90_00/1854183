The MICs of 12 antimicrobial agents for 42 cysteine-requiring strains of Escherichia coli showed a high concordance when determined on three different media, one of which was supplemented with cysteine. Differences in the MICs of several agents were detected between 18 prototrophic revertants and their parent auxotrophs. A total of 64.7% of the isolates were fully susceptible to all agents, and no particular resistance pattern was evident.
