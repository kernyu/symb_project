Drug resistance of Mycobacterium tuberculosis was followed up within a period of 1986 to 1989. There was a tendency to stabilization of resistance to streptomycin (42 per cent), tubazid (45.2 per cent) and ethionamide (up. to 1.4 per cent). Resistance to kanamycin slowly increased (by 3 to 6 per cent every year). Resistance to rifampicin markedly increased (almost 15 times). Resistance to ethambutol decreased (10 times). It was shown that the drug resistance could be lowered by using the drug combinations.
