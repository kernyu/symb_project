Effects of dipterex, temephos, and chlorpyrifos resistance on the relative fitness of Culex pipiens pallens (L.) were evaluated by examining developmental and reproductive characteristics. Age-specific life tables of Dip-R- (dipterex), Tmo-R- (temephos), and Chl-R- (chlorpyrifos) resistant strains were compared with the susceptible strain to determine relative fitness based on population trend indices (I). The 3 organophosphate-resistant strains possessed reproductive and developmental disadvantages involving fecundity and survival relative compared with the susceptible strain, with relative fitness values of 0.465, 0.520, and 0.501, respectively. These results are discussed in relation to the reversal from resistance to susceptibility in natural populations of mosquitoes.
