Antimicrobial susceptibilities of Neisseria gonorrhoeae isolates from female sex workers and from men with urethritis in Bandung, Indonesia, were determined by an agar dilution technique. Typing of the Tet M plasmid in tetracycline-resistant isolates (TRNG) was performed using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique and plasmid profiles of penicillinase-producing isolates (PPNG) were determined. All PPNG possessed the 4.4 MDa beta-lactamase plasmid and all TRNG showed a PCR fragment characteristic of the 'Dutch' type Tet M plasmid. Of the 50 gonococci isolates tested, all were resistant to tetracycline; 47 were TRNG, 26 were PPNG, and 6 were resistant to thiamphenicol. Chromosomal resistance to penicillin was not detected. All isolates were susceptible to ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, kanamycin, spectinomycin, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Spectinomycin and fluoroquinolones are useful primary drugs for treatment of gonococcal infection in Bandung. Continued surveillance of antimicrobial resistance should be part of gonorrhoea control in Indonesia.
