The prevalence of antibiotic resistance is increasing in pediatric pathogens. Methicillin resistance in Staphylococcus aureus and in S. epidermidis, and erythromycin resistance in group A streptococci are becoming major problems. Fortunately, all three species remain susceptible to vancomycin. In certain parts of the world, Haemophilus influenzae b that are resistant to a number of antibiotics are being recognized. Antibiotic therapy of pediatric infections in the future will continue to rely on yet-to-be developed agents.
