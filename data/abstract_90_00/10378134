Ninety-three patients with gram-negative bacillary meningitis (GNBM) were identified at Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, over a period of 12 years. Among them, eight showed resistance to third-generation cephalosporins, accounting for 9% of the total GNBM cases and 29% of the postneurosurgical GNBM cases. The resistant pathogens included Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacter freundii and Morganella morganii. These eight patients, six males and two females aged 18-61 years, all had nosocomially acquired meningitis associated with head trauma and/or postneurosurgical states. Six patients received imipenem/cilastatin treatment; five survived and one died. The other two expired because they did not receive appropriate antibiotic treatment. Although third-generation cephalosporin-resistant GNBM is rare, its incidence has been increasing over the past 5 years. In patients with nosocomially-acquired postneurosurgical GNBM, the presence of third-generation cephalosporin resistance should therefore be highly suspected. The appropriate choice of antibiotic is essential for their survival.
