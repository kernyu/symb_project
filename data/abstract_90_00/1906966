The sequences of six tetracycline efflux proteins and three transport proteins which have some resemblance to them were compared. The tetracycline efflux proteins fall into three families: (i) those encoded by pBR322, RP1, and Tn10 (Escherichia coli); (ii) pT181 (Staphylococcus aureus) and pTHT15 (Bacillus subtilis); and (iii) tet347 (Streptomyces rimosus). There is global sequence homology within each of the first two families, but there is none between the families. The pT181/pTHT15 family shares close homology with the N-terminal half of the methylenomycin A efflux protein (Streptomyces coelicor), while tet347 resembles the C-terminal half. Portions of the N-terminal half of the Tn10-encoded protein show significant resemblance to portions in the N-terminal half of the pT181/pTHT15 family, but this sometimes occurs among transport proteins which do not have a common substrate. Tetracycline efflux proteins, therefore, appear to have arisen on at least two, or possibly three, separate occasions, probably from other transport proteins.
