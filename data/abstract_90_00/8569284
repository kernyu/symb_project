We investigated the difference in natural resistance to Legionella pneumophila infection between aged (18-20-month-old) and young (3-month-old) mice of ddY strain. Aged mice were more susceptible to the bacterial infection than young mice; 50% lethal doses of L. pneumophila for aged and young mice were 2.2 x 10(7) and 8.5 x 10(7) colony forming units (CFU), respectively, after intraperitoneal injection of the bacteria. The bacterial burden in the livers was larger in aged than young mice after a challenge with a sublethal dose of L. pneumophila. However, peritoneal macrophages of aged mice paradoxically had a greater capacity to kill intracellular L. pneumophila than those of young mice. Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) production from naive spleen cells was compared after an in vitro stimulation with formalin-killed L. pneumophila. Spleen cells of aged mice produced significantly less IFN-gamma than those of young mice. When anti-murine IFN-gamma monoclonal antibody was administered before the bacterial infection, the subsequent bacterial burden in the livers significantly increased in young but not in aged mice. These data suggest that, in aged mice, IFN-gamma production is depressed at an early phase of L. pneumophila infection and it renders aged mice more susceptible to the infection.
