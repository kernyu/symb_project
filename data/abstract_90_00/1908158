A rifampin-resistant mutant of Brucella abortus, designated RB51, was derived by repeated passage of strain 2308 on Trypticase soy supplemented with 1.5% agar and varying concentrations rifampin or penicillin. The RB51 colonies absorbed crystal violet and RB51 cell suspensions autoagglutinated, indicating a rough type colonial morphology for this strain. No O-chain component was detected in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) extracted from RB51 on SDS-PAGE gels stained with silver. Western blot analysis with the monoclonal antibody BRU 38, which is specific for the perosamine homopolymer O-chain of smooth Brucella LPS, indicated that the LPS of RB51 is highly deficient in O-chain when compared with the parenteral smooth strain 2308 or rough strain 45/20. Biochemically, RB51 resembles parental strain 2308 in its ability to utilize erythritol. Intraperitoneal inoculation of RB51 into mice results in a splenic colonization which is cleared within four weeks post infection. RB51 does not revert to smooth colony morphology upon passage in vivo (mice) or in vitro. Mice infected with RB51 produce antibodies against B. abortus antigens including class 2 and 3 outer membrane proteins but not against the O-chain. Furthermore, rabbits, goats and cattle hyperimmunized with sonicates of RB51 develop antibodies to B. abortus cellular antigens but do not develop antibodies specific for the O-chain. Immunization of mice with 1 x 10(8) viable RB51 organisms confers significant protection against challenge with virulent B. abortus strain 2308.
