All living organisms have been exposed to noxious compounds throughout their long evolutionary history and those surviving have evolved to fabricate devices that detoxicate and extrude these life threatening substances. It is likely, therefore, that all viable organisms, from bacteria to mammals, are equipped with active extrusion machinery. When bacteria are attacked by antibiotics, they use these tactics to combat the drugs and to develop resistance. Drugs extrusion machinery in Gram-negative bacteria is complex, consisting of the inner membrane transporter which acts as an energy-dependent extrusion pump; a binding protein which presumably connect both membranes; and the outer membrane exit channel. The extrusion pump assemblies are often encoded by chromosomal genes and might be expressed by mutation(s) or induced in the presence of drug(s).
