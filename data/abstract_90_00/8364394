We have previously shown the presence, in the amplified DNA of a Drosophila cell line resistant to N-phosphonacetyl-L-aspartate (PALA), of two units of 150 kb and 120 kb respectively duplicated and amplified. The two joints (J1 and J2) linking these units as well as their respective wild-type counterparts have been sequenced. Sequence analysis indicates that a region of the Drosophila genome which corresponds to the proximal boundary of the 150 kb unit is common to both joints. In addition to this common region, the J1 junction possesses a 26-nucleotide sequence belonging to the J2 junction. This indicates that the J2 junction was the first formed, and that J1, therefore, results from recombination between J2 and a region of the wild-type genome 120 kb distal to J2. Sequence analysis also reveals that the joints result from illegitimate recombination between unrelated regions. AT-rich sequences, strand bias composition and putative topoisomerase I and II sites were found in at least one of the two parental sequences involved in the formation of the joints. On the basis of these results we can hypothesize that after two illegitimate recombinations between sister chromatids, leading first to J2 and then to J1, the amplification may have arisen by a series of homologous (unequal crossing-over) or illegitimate recombinations, or by an intrachromosomal rolling circle.
