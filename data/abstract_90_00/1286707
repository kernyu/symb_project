Published opinion supports the early use of prophylactic antibiotics soon after presentation of a potentially contaminated intraocular foreign body (IOFB) in the posterior segment, preferably within 12 hours of trauma when the visual acuity is still good. Recommended treatment includes topical, subconjunctival, parenteral and especially intravitreal antibiotic therapy to reduce the chance of endophthalmitis. Intravitreal therapy should include gentamicin with vancomycin or clindamycin to cover Bacillus spp., since this organism is responsible for half the endophthalmitis cases and produces beta-lactamase giving resistance to penicillins and cephalosporins. Intravitreal therapy is important because systemic and topical antibiotics do not penetrate the globe in sufficient concentration to control a fulminant infection associated with damaged tissue. Early therapy is essential, as delaying treatment until endophthalmitis occurs is less likely to save useful vision. All vitreous aspirated, plus pus if present, and the IOFB should be cultured for bacteria and fungi to identify pathogens and gain antibiotic sensitivities. The prevention of IOFB-associated endophthalmitis requires early recognition of the IOFB and enthusiastic antibiotic therapy at the time of its removal.
