Several genes have been identified that are highly expressed during conidiation. Inactivation of these genes has no observable phenotypic effect. Transcripts of two such genes, con-6 and con-10, are normally absent from vegetative mycelia. To identify regulatory genes that affect con-6 and/or con-10 expression, strains were prepared in which the regulatory regions for these genes were fused to a gene conferring hygromycin resistance. Mutants were then selected that were resistant to the drug during mycelial growth. Mutations in several of the isolates had trans effects; they activated transcription of the corresponding intact gene and, in most isolates, one or more of the other con genes. Most interestingly, resistant mutants were obtained that were defective at different stages of conidiation. One mutant conidiated under conditions that do not permit conidiation in wild type.
