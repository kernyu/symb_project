The susceptibility patterns of 480 isolates representing six recently defined species of coryneform bacteria (Corynebacterium amycolatum [n = 101], Corynebacterium auris [n = 48], Corynebacterium glucuronolyticum [n = 86], Brevibacterium casei [n = 50], Dermabacter hominis [n = 49], and Turicella otitidis [n = 146]) to 17 antimicrobial agents were determined by an agar dilution method. Most significantly, for C. amycolatum strains the MICs at which 90% of isolates are inhibited were > or = 32 micrograms/ml for nearly all agents. However, all 480 strains examined were susceptible to glycopeptide antibiotics.
