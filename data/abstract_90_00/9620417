Low-level vancomycin resistance was observed for 28 clinical Clostridium innocuum isolates and C. innocuum NCIB 10674, whereas teicoplanin was active. DNA from three clinical isolates and the type strain could not be amplified by PCR with primers specific for the genes vanA, vanB, and vanC, suggesting that C. innocuum is intrinsically resistant to vancomycin.
