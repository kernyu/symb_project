DXG and its prodrug DAPD have been demonstrated to be effective inhibitors of HIV-1 in various cells. The EC50s for DXG were 0.032 microM in CBMCs and 0.05 microM in MT-4 cells, which were generally equipotent as 3TC. 3TC-resistant, but not AZT-resistant, HIV-1 had minimum diminished sensitivity to the compounds. Both DXG and DAPD were non-toxic to cells up to 500 microM.
