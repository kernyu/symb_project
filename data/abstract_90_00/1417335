One hundred and thirty six Lactobacillus strains isolated from poultry and 23 Lactobacillus strains isolated from long-living persons were tested for their antibiotic sensitivity. Occurrence of some type determinants of resistance to aminoglycoside antibiotics and tetracyclines in the Lactobacillus strains resistant to these antibiotics was studied. The majority of the strains from the both collections were resistant to aminoglycosides (73 and 79 per cent, respectively). The isolates from the poultry were characterized by multiple resistance. The isolates from the long-living persons were most frequently resistant to one of two antibiotics. All the tested Lactobacillus strains isolated from the long-living persons were sensitive to tetracyclines. The species composition of the isolates was different. The antibiotic-resistant strains were detected in all the species involved in the study. By hybridization of Lactobacillus colonies with the probes containing various genes of the resistance it was shown that in 14 per cent of the antibiotic-resistant strains belonging to Lactobacillus the antibiotic resistance was controlled by the genes homologous to resistance genes widely distributed in gramnegative organisms. This indicated a possible wide exchange and heterologous expression of the antibiotic resistance determinants between microorganisms of various taxonomic groups.
