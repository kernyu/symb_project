Chemotherapy of haemoparasitic diseases in domestic animals is dependent on a limited number of compounds, many of which are chemically closely related. In this review, a summary is given of each of the drugs currently available for treatment and prophylaxis of trypanosomosis and the tick-borne diseases theileriosis, babesiosis, anaplasmosis and cowdriosis. In contrast to the situation with the drugs used for tick-borne diseases, drug resistance appears to be becoming an increasing problem associated with the compounds used for trypanosomosis. The literature that has been reviewed, therefore, is that which relates to the methods used to identify and quantify drug resistance in trypanosome populations, reports of resistance to trypanocides, and cross-resistance between trypanosome populations, reports of resistance to trypanocides, and cross-resistance between trypanocides. The possible reason(s) for the apparent lack of development of resistance to the compounds used for treatment of tick-borne diseases is also discussed. Local toxicity at the site of injection is a problem that is particularly associated with many of the trypanocides when used on a long-term basis in individual animals. Various alternative preparations of the currently used trypanocides therefore have been evaluated in an attempt to reduce this toxicity, and are summarised. Finally, future developments in haemoparasitic chemotherapy are considered and, for trypanosomosis, highlight the importance of integrating chemotherapeutic and chemoprophylactic programmes with control of the vector when drug resistance becomes a significant constraint.
