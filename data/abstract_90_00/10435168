High-level gentamicin-resistant enterococci present problems in the treatment of infected patients, especially as synergy between penicillin and gentamicin is lost. Previous studies have suggested various risk factors for the acquisition of these enterococci. A case-controlled study was performed on 17 patients infected with resistant enterococci and 26 infected with sensitive strains who attended a London hospital. The key risk factors for acquisition of infection with high-level gentamicin-resistant enterococci were found to be prior prolonged antibiotic treatment, use of five or more antibiotics, and the presence of a urinary catheter. It is proposed that infection control measures should be targeted at patients at higher risk. In addition, control of antibiotic usage in a hospital may help to prevent acquisition and spread of these organisms.
