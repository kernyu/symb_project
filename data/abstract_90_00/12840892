To study sensitivity of drug resistance indexes and resistance manner in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), MTT drug sensitivity, growth types of CFU-L in vitro, Bcl-2 antigen and Bcl-2/Bax ratio and intracellular fluorescence intensity of daunorubicin (DNR) were determined. In 62 cases of AML, the positive coincidence rate was 73% with MTT test and the negative coincidence rate was 70%. In 3 commonly used drugs, if one drug showed sensitivity, the coincidence remission rate reached 71%. In 51 cases of AML, there were 31 patients in the group of complete remission (CR), in which CFU-L of 29 patients showed independent growth. CFU-L of 2 patients showed no growth. However, there were 20 patients in the group of non-remission (NR), in which CFU-L of 14 patients showed independent growth. CFU-L of 6 patients showed non-growth pattern. Statistical analysis showed significant difference (P < 0.05). In 32 cases of AML, the expression rate of Bcl-2 was 59.55% +/- 19.56% in drug-sensitive group, and one was 77.36% +/- 11.91% in drug-resistant group, respectively (P < 0.05). At the same time, the ratio of Bcl-2/Bax was 7.50 +/- 5.04 in drug-sensitive group and one was 14.32 +/- 8.99 in drug-resistant group, respectively (P < 0.05). In 15 case of clinically drug-resistant AML, the fluorescence histogram of DNR showed left-shift of main peak (LSMP) in 12 patients. They were diagnosed as classical drug resistance. Meanwhile, 1 patient showed right-shift of main peak (RSMP) in 3 patients. They were diagnosed as re-growth drug resistance. It is concluded that MTT and CFU-L might be used for prediction of drug sensitivity or resistance when patients were on treatment. Bcl-2 and ratio of Bcl-2/Bax might be associated with the prognosis. DNR histogram could be employed for identify the pattern drug resistance. The strength and weakness of these techniques were discussed.
