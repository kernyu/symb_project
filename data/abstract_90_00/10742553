To investigate the mechanism for the resistance of IL-6-deficient mice to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), we examined the production of cytokines in lymph nodes (LNs) of wild-type and IL-6-deficient mice immunized with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis. Significant up-regulation of IL-4 production and down-regulation of IFN-gamma production were found in LNs from IL-6-deficient mice as compared to LNs from wild-type mice. Administration of IL-6, which caused typical EAE in IL-6-deficient mice immunized with MOG, reduced IL-4 production but did not restore IFN-gamma production in LNs of IL-6-deficient mice. These results implied that the resistance of IL-6-deficient mice to EAE might be mainly due to enhancement of Th2 response.
