The relationships between antibiotic use and bacterial resistance are not so easy to demonstrate. However, the evidence is abundant and mostly consistent. In this review, we will consider and discuss the different levels of evidence models: biological, consistent associations, dose-effect relationship, and concomitant variations. Decision-making is dependent of the local conditions. In the hospital, establishing an epidemiological diagnosis is a prerequisite to any decision, including restriction of antibiotic use.
