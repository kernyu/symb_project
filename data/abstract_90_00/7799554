Hospital-acquired pneumonia is one of the most important fatal respiratory diseases in the elderly. Prompt and precise empiric therapy is essential for recovery. Fourteen isolates from twelve elderly lepromatous leprosy patients (9 men, 3 women, mean age of 75.8 years) with hospital-acquired pneumonia were studied. Subsequently, empiric therapy with gentamicin and beta-lactams for nosocomial pneumonia in the elderly was examined. Fourteen types of bacteria isolated from expectorated sputum specimens consisted mainly of ten strains of gram-negative bacilli (71%) six of Klebsiella pneumoniae, one each of Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter agglomerans, Serratia liquefaciens, and Aeromonas hydrophilia and four strains of gram-positive cocci (29%) two of Staphylococcus sp., one each of Streptococcus sp. and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas sp. were not detected. Resistance rates of the etiologic agents to the antibiotics showed that gentamicin was 7.7%, ceftazidime 0%, and cefmetazole 23.1%. Cephalosporins were superior to penicillins. As a result of empiric therapy, six elderly leprosy patients with nosocomial pneumonia were cured and one improved temporarily. This study shows the necessity of specific empiric therapy for hospital-acquired pneumonia in a hospital with many elderly patients. The combination of gentamicin and beta-lactams is of value as an initial antibiotic therapy for hospital-acquired pneumonia in the elderly.
