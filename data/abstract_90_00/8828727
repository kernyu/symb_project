Forty-five patients with presumed acute bacterial conjunctivitis were treated in an investigator-masked randomized multicenter study with either lomefloxacin 0.3% or fucidic acid 1% eye drops twice daily. Clinical signs and symptoms were rated by slit-lamp examination and conjunctival swab cultures were performed to evaluate clinical and microbiological efficacy. A total of 57 ocular isolates were tested for susceptibility to nine antibiotics. A significant decrease in clinical symptomatology was achieved by both treatments with a gradual improvement over the treatment period of 7-9 days. Bacteriological recovery was frequently achieved already at the first control visit (day 3-5), but the recovery rate was statistically significant (p = 0.014) only in the lomefloxacin group. The relatively high in vitro resistance rate (46%) to fucidic acid was not reflected by lower clinical efficacy. Two unrelated adverse events (one in each treatment group) and minimal local intolerance problems were observed in both treatment groups. A significantly higher incidence of burning sensation was observed with fucidic acid than with lomefloxacin (p < 0.01). All four treatment failures in the study occurred in the fucidic acid group. Lomefloxacin 0.3% ophthalmic solution demonstrated a high efficacy and good tolerance in the management of acute bacterial conjunctivitis.
