Isolates obtained from the blood of ten patients with Arcanobacterium haemolyticum septicaemia were biotyped as smooth or rough using morphological and biochemical criteria, and their susceptibilities to 18 antibacterial agents were determined. Nine of the clinical cases included here have not been reported previously and are discussed in brief. One of the strains was highly resistant to macrolides and clindamycin. With one exception, the strains belonged to the smooth biotype. The data presented here indicates that the treatment of systemic Arcanobacterium haemolyticum infections should be based on the antibacterial susceptibility profiles of individual strains and on the site of the infection.
