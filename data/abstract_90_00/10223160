A 3-year old child was admitted for a pneumococcal pneumonia with pleural effusion, initially treated with amoxicillin and clavulanic acid. Clinical deterioration suggested a resistance to conventional antibiotics which was confirmed by bacteriological investigation. A co-infection with respiratory syncitial virus and Mycoplasma pneumoniae was associated. Under adapted antibiotherapy, the clinical course improved.
