The diversity of aerobic chemoorganotrophic (capable of growing on nutrient agar) bacteria in radioactive soil (0.3-17.0 microCi/kg soil) sampled in the 10-km zone around the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant (CNPP) was found to be lower than that observed in control, uncontaminated soil with a radioactivity of 0.002-0.006 microCi/kg soil. All the radioactive soil samples contained the bacteria Bacillus cereus and Methylobacterium extorquens or M. mesophillicum, which exhibited a high tolerance to 0.3-1.0 M hydrogen peroxide, whose action can to a certain extent simulate the effect of ionizing radiation. Some of the contaminated soil samples contained other species of chemoorganotrophic bacteria with a low tolerance to H2O2. The survival of bacteria in the Chernobyl accident zone is probably due to the functioning of mechanisms efficiently neutralizing peroxide compounds and repairing radiation-damaged DNA. The population of cellulolytic, nitrifying, and sulfate-reducing bacteria in contaminated soil was found to be 1-2 orders of magnitude less than in control soil, indicating the unfavorable effect of anthropogenic radiation on the abundance and diversity of soil bacteria.
