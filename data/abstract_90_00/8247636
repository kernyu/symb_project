Moraxella catarrhalis is a Gram-negative diplococcus of the Neisseriaceae family now recognized as a cause of acute otitis media in pediatric patients and of lower respiratory tract infections in debilitated adults. The finding that 80% to 90% of strains produce beta-lactamases together with reports of cases of bacteremia and arthritis due to M. catarrhalis suggest an increasing pathogenic role for this organism. Antibiotic susceptibility testing suggests that the greatest bactericidal effect is provided by amoxicillin-clavulanic acid.
