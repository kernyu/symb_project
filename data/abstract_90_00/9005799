The efficacy of ofloxacin in the treatment of acute intestinal infection was estimated. The trial included 31 patients: 27 with acute dysentery and 4 with salmonellosis. In all the patients the diagnosis was confirmed bacteriologically. The drug was used in a dose of 200 mg twice a day for 5 days. During the first 2 days ofloxacin was administered intravenously and during the following 3 days it was used orally. In the treatment of 3 patients with medium diseases ofloxacin was used orally during the first 3 days in a dose of 200 mg twice a day in combination with intravenous drop-wise infusion of the drug in a dose of 200 mg twice a day. In the chronic carriers ofloxacin was used in a dose of 400 mg twice a day for 5 days. Good efficacy of the drug was observed in the treatment of acute dysentery evident from the disease rapid favourable time course: by the 2nd day the body temperature lowered and the abdominal pains alleviated and by the 4th to the 6th days the stool came to the normal. Dysbiotic changes in the patients treated with ofloxacin were less pronounced by comparison with those after the treatment with other antibacterial drugs. Ofloxacin provided rapid eradication of Chlamydia in the faces and the recovery from chlamydiosis as a concomitant disease of acute dysentery in 8 patients.
