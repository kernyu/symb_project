The in vitro activities of the new biguanide PS-15 and its putative active metabolite, WR99210, were determined against seven different isolates or clones of Plasmodium falciparum. The mean 50% inhibitory concentrations of PS-15 and WR99210 were 1,015 and 0.06 ng/ml, respectively. WR99210 was up to 363 times more potent than cycloguanil, the active metabolite of proguanil, against cycloguanil-resistant parasites. The pronounced activity of WR99210 against multidrug-resistant P. falciparum indicates that further studies are required to determine the value of the prodrug, PS-15, as an antimalarial agent.
