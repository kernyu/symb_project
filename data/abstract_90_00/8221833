One hundred and fifteen healthy children in 2 kindergartens of Beijing City were enrolled in a study for carrier state of Haemophilus influenzae (HI) in pharynx. Nontypable HI flora was found in 32.2% (37/115) in this group. There were no significant differences of carrier state in sex, age, and season in these children. Antibiotic sensitivity test showed that some HI strains isolated were resistant to ampicillin and tetracycline (5/34 vs 4/34), most strains resistant to SMZ Co (21/34).
