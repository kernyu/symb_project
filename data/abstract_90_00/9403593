Enhanced production of oxygen free radicals may play a role in hypertension by affecting vascular smooth muscle contraction, resistance to blood flow, and organ damage. The aim of this study was to determine whether oxygen free radicals are involved in the development of salt-induced hypertension. Dahl salt-sensitive (Dahl-S) and salt-resistant (Dahl-R) rats were fed either a high salt (6.0% NaCl) or low salt (0.3% NaCl) diet for 4 weeks. The high salt diet caused the development of severe hypertension in Dahl-S animals and had no effect on blood pressure in Dahl-R animals. A tetranitroblue tetrazolium dye was used to detect superoxide radicals in microvessels of the mesentery. Light absorption measurements revealed enhanced staining along the endothelium of arterioles and venules in hypertensive Dahl-S animals, with significantly lower values in normotensive animals. In addition, a Clark electrochemical electrode was used to measure hydrogen peroxide levels in fresh plasma. Hypertensive Dahl-S animals had a higher plasma hydrogen peroxide concentration compared with their normotensive counterparts (2.81+/-0.43 versus 2.10+/-0.41 micromol/L), while no difference was detected between high- and low salt-treated Dahl-R animals (1.70+/-0.35 versus 1.56+/-0.51 micromol/L). The plasma hydrogen peroxide levels of all groups correlated with mean arterial pressure (r=.77). These findings demonstrate an enhanced production of oxygen free radicals in the microvasculature of hypertensive Dahl-S rats.
