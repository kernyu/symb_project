We compared the pharmacodynamic activities of vancomycin with or without gentamicin in an in vitro infection model with methicilin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus-infected fibrin-platelet clots. Infected fibrin-platelet clots (FPCs) were prepared with human cryoprecipitate, human platelets, thrombin, and the organism (approximately 10[9] CFU of MRSA-494/g) and were suspended with monofilament line in an infection model capable of simulating human pharmacokinetics. Antibiotics were bolused to simulate vancomycin regimens of 2 g every 24 h (q24h), 1 g q12h, 500 mg q6h, and continuous infusion (steady-state concentration of 20 microg/ml) and gentamicin regimens of 1.5 mg/kg of body weight q12h and 5 mg/kg once daily (q.d.). Model experiments were performed in duplicate over 72 h. FPCs were removed from the models in quadruplicate at 0, 8, 24, 32, 48, 72 h, weighed, homogenized, diluted, and plated to determine colony counts. The inoculum density at 72 h was used to compare bactericidal activities between the regimens. All regimens containing vancomycin significantly decreased the bacterial inoculum compared to the growth control (P < 0.001). Vancomycin monotherapy regimens were similar in bacterial kill regardless of dosing frequency. The addition of gentamicin (either q12h or q.d.) significantly improved the bactericidal activity of the vancomycin q6h, q12h, and q24h regimens (P < 0.001). The greatest reduction in bacterial density at 72 h (P < 0.001) and the most rapid rate of kill (time to 99.9% killing) were achieved with the regimen consisting of 2 g of vancomycin q24h plus gentamicin (q.d. or q12h).
