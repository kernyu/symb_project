In order to evaluate antimicrobial activity of meropenem (MEPM), minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of MEPM and control drugs were determined against clinical isolates in 1993. The results were as follows; 1. Antimicrobial activities of MEPM against Gram-positive bacteria were stronger than those of cephems (CEPs), were approximately equal to those of panipenem (PAPM), and were weaker than those of imipenem (IPM). 2. Carbapenems showed strong antimicrobial activities against Enterobacteriaccae, glucose non-fermentative Gram-negative rods and Bacteroides fragilis group that were multiple drug resistant including the third generation CEPs. Antimicrobial activities of MEPM against these organisms were stronger than those of IPM and PAPM. 3. MIC-ranges of MEPM against Enterobacteriaceae and Haemophilus influenzae were lower than those of IPM and PAPM. We observed that MEPM had better permeability into the cells of H. influenzae, higher affinities to 3 to 5 different penicillin-binding protein and high stability against beta-lactamase than those of IPM and PAPM.
