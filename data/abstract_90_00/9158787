Since 1982, a national veterinary network has been involved in the monitoring of resistance to antimicrobial agents in the main pathogenic bacteria isolated from diseased cattle in France. It is based on 40 regional veterinary diagnostic laboratories and managed by a central reference laboratory (CNEVA Lyon). Highly standardized methods are used in the diagnostic laboratories. This network collects up-to-date information on antimicrobial resistance in veterinary isolates and gathers strains for specific studies on fastidious bacteria and for the analysis of mechanisms of resistance to antibiotics. Such a permanent survey is essential to establish a rational veterinary antibiotic policy. It could be connected to other compatible systems developed in other fields such as human medicine, food, and environment, to evaluate the importance of resistance and R-factors spread for public health. The limits and perspectives of this surveillance system are discussed.
