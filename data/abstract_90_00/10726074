Despite a declining incidence of gonorrhea in much of the industrialized world, antimicrobial resistance continues to present a challenge to the treatment of gonococcal infections. Although no clinically significant resistance to the broad-spectrum cephalosporins has been identified, fluoroquinolone-resistant gonococcal strains are now prevalent in Australia and much of the Far East. Ongoing surveillance for antimicrobial resistance is crucial to obtain the information needed to choose effective empiric therapies for gonorrhea.
