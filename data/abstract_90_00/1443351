The in vitro activity of halofantrine was studied in chloroquine-susceptible and chloroquine-resistant African clones of Plasmodium falciparum over a period of six months. The susceptibility level remained stable in both clones. The chloroquine-susceptible clone (50% inhibitory concentration [IC50] 6.88 nM) was less susceptible to halofantrine than the chloroquine-resistant clone (IC50 2.98 nM). Using an isotopic semimicro drug susceptibility test, the in vitro activity of halofantrine was compared with the activities of chloroquine, quinine, and mefloquine to study the cross-resistance patterns against 76 African isolates of P. falciparum isolated from cases of malaria imported into France. Chloroquine-resistant isolates (n = 47) were significantly less susceptible to quinine (IC50 234 nM), but were more susceptible to both mefloquine (IC50 3.20 nM) and halofantrine (IC50 1.14 nM) compared with the chloroquine-susceptible isolates (n = 29; IC50 147 nM for quinine, 7.16 nM for mefloquine, and 2.62 nM for halofantrine). A significant positive correlation was found between the activities of chloroquine and quinine and between those of mefloquine and halofantrine, indicating cross-resistance between these drugs, while a negative correlation was observed between chloroquine and mefloquine or halofantrine. The responses to quinine and mefloquine or halofantrine showed no correlation with each other. These results reinforce the importance of a cautious use of antimalarial drugs in Africa.
