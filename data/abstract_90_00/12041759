We considered 256 strains of S. aureus (SA) and S. non-aureus (SnA) of recent clinical isolation. Their susceptibility (S) or resistance (R) to pefloxacin, ciprofloxacin, enoxacin, ofloxacin (which have been used in therapy for several years) and to timentin as well, has been tested, in relation with methicillin susceptibility (MS) and methicillin resistance (MR). To date, the activity of quinolones against all staphylococci remains relatively high, notwithstanding the appearance of resistant strains, in particular among MR SnA. Of the four quinolones examined, ofloxacin showed to be the most active, i.e. effective against 100% of the staphylococci, either SA or SnA.
