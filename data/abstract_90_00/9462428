The treatment of deep fungal infection in haematological malignancy remains controversial due to the limited number of antifungal agents available and problems over their spectrum and dose-limiting side-effects. Difficulties in diagnosis mean that most treatments are begun empirically; amphotericin B remains the drug of choice. Emerging resistance may limit the usefulness of fluconazole and other azoles in some areas. Lipid preparations of amphotericin B have reduced the toxicity of this agent, but some issues of dosage and efficacy remain. Adjunctive treatments aimed at augmenting the host response to infection may have a role to play in deep fungal infection.
