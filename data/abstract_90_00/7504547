This presentation discusses the role that proliferative advantage plays in making both the chronic and blastic phases of CML resistant to therapy. A case is made for the addition of "regrowth" inhibitors between courses of chemotherapy as a means of increasing the efficacy of therapy by suppressing or reducing the proliferative advantage that the target cells enjoy over those cells which one would like to repopulate the hematopoietic system.
