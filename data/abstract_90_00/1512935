Norfloxacin (NFLX), a new quinolone antibiotic agent, was evaluated for its efficacy in experimental osteomyelitis in rabbits. Osteomyelitis was induced in male rabbits by the inoculation of 10(7) CFU/ml (0.1 ml) of Staphylococcus aureus (MIC for NFLX: 0.78 micrograms/ml) with 0.4 ml of 3% sodium tetradecyl sulphate into the medullary cavity of the proximal tibia. The rabbits were divided into 3 different groups of 4 animals each. The animals in 2 groups were orally administered with NFLX; 100 mg/kg once-daily (group 2) and 50 mg/kg twice-daily (group 3) for 7 days from the 6th hour after inoculation. Group 1 was established as a control without administration of NFLX. All animals were sacrificed on the 7th day after inoculation. Acute osteomyelitic changes were found microscopically in all animals in group 1. In each of the 2 therapeutic groups, incidence of microscopic changes was 50% associated with remission of S-sialic acid value. Thus, NFLX may be considered a useful antimicrobial agent for the treatment of suppurative osteomyelitis.
