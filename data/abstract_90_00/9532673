Treatment of food-producing animals with antimicrobial agents that are important in human therapy may present a public health risk by the transfer of resistant zoonotic pathogens from animals to humans. Resistant bacteria can diminish the effectiveness of antibiotics and demand the use of more expensive or less safe alternatives. In 1996, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) established the National Antimicrobial Monitoring System to prospectively monitor changes in antimicrobial susceptibilities of zoonotic pathogens from human and animal clinical specimens, healthy farm animals, and carcasses of food-producing animals at slaughter plants. This article describes the development, implementation, and objectives of the monitoring system and presents initial data generated by the system.
