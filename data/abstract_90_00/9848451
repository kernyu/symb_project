An orally administered streptogramin (RPR 106,972) and a parenteral streptogramin (quinupristin/dalfopristin) were evaluated against a collection of 2481 recent clinical isolates of gram-positive cocci. The isolates were gathered from ten North American medical centres during the winter months of 1996-1997. In spite of minor differences, both streptogramins had essentially identical spectra of activity which included many erythromycin-resistant isolates. Previously proposed interpretative criteria for quinupristin/dalfopristin disc diffusion susceptibility tests were confirmed.
