In The Gambia, 760 children less than 10 years of age with Plasmodium falciparum malaria were treated with chloroquine (25 mg/kg) and followed-up 2 and 9 d after the start of treatment. 700 children (92.1%) completed the study. The level of in vivo resistance to chloroquine varied by area from 0.4% to 16.4%. Of the 28 children found to have chloroquine resistant malaria, none was ill when seen at the 9 d follow-up and only 3 (10.3%) required further treatment with alternative antimalarials because of persistent high levels of parasitaemia. However, the fact that 30.4% of the children who completed the study had chloroquine in their urine at presentation may have masked the true level of resistance and led to underestimation of the clinical significance of these findings. The blood film at day 2 did not usefully predict resistance. 67 isolates were tested in vitro for chloroquine sensitivity. The mean EC50 was 15.5 nmol/litre, an eight-fold decrease in sensitivity from that of isolates tested in 1982. 8 (11%) of the isolates had EC50s above the WHO reference value for sensitive isolates of 18.3 nmol/litre, with values ranging from 22 to 65 nmol/litre of culture medium. Gambian isolates were sensitive to quinine (mean EC50 = 49.6 nmol/litre).
