Non nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI) are a new arm in the treatment of the HIV infection. They inhibit the replication by direct non competitive binding to the enzyme, and do not require phosphorylation. The fast emergence of resistance in monotherapy obliges to use them in a triple association. The 103 mutation confers a cross-resistance. The most common adverse event is rash. Association with nucleoside analogues is additive or even synergistic. They are metabolized by the cytochrome P450. Within a combined therapy, their efficiency is comparable to protease inhibitors, notably in patients with low viral load.
