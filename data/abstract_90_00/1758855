The follow-up of 301 patients with fibrous-cavernous pulmonary tuberculosis has demonstrated that the disease outcome and treatment effectiveness depend on the nature of its course. A long-term specific therapy for 9-10 months brings about cessation of bacillary excretion in 50-60% of cases even in a progressive course of the disease and closure of destruction cavities occurred in 12.5% of cases with rapid progression and in 21.7% of cases with slow progression of the disease. Despite all measures taken, stabilization of the process fails in one-fourth of the patients with rapidly progressing fibrous-cavernous tuberculosis and in 9% of those with a slowly progressing course. In 90% of cases bacillary excretion in patients with stable fibrous-cavernous tuberculosis ceased in 3 months and in 100% after 6 months of treatment.
