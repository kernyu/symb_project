Before the development of the first antimicrobial agents, bacteria already had demonstrated an ability to adapt to stress in the environment, resulting in the development of resistance that often makes the prevailing antibiotic treatment ineffective. The response to antimicrobial resistance in the medical community has been to use new or alternative antibiotics not previously used against the resistant bacteria. The pharmaceutical industry has responded to the resistance problem by producing newer antibiotics, either as modifications of currently existing compounds or as combinations of compounds that may inhibit or bypass the bacterial resistance mechanisms. The development of new antibiotics is a lengthy and costly process. To be successful, the pharmaceutical industry must anticipate the changing needs of the medical community, as well as the dynamic process of antimicrobial resistance. The marketing of new antimicrobial agents must be adaptable to the potential environmental pressures that induce bacterial resistance in order to ensure the longevity of the agents.
