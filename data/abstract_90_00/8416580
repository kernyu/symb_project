To avoid the disadvantages associated with use of the traditional percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTC) needle in ultrasonically guided percutaneous ethanol injection therapy (PEIT) for hepatocellular carcinoma, the authors developed a needle with a three-sided tip and three holes within 3 mm of the tip. In comparison with a PTC needle, the PEIT needle passed into the liver along a straighter line with less resistance and reflected a higher echo from the tip.
