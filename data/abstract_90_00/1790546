The pathophysiology and microbiology of lower respiratory tract infections are outlined and diagnostic and therapeutic problems considered. The use of sulbactam/ampicillin in the treatment of these infections is evaluated. The two drugs have similar pharmacokinetic characteristics; predictable and dose-dependent peak serum concentrations of both agents are achieved after parenteral administration. More than 90% of strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Klebsiella sp, Escherichia coli, and Acinetobacter sp were inhibited by ampicillin/sulbactam concentrations of 16/8 micrograms/ml. Serum concentrations of ampicillin and sulbactam were 18 to 28 micrograms/ml and 13 micrograms/ml, respectively, after intramuscular administration of 1 gm/0.5 gm of ampicillin/sulbactam and 58 micrograms/ml and 30 micrograms/ml, respectively, after intravenous administration of the same dose. Good distribution of ampicillin/sulbactam into lung tissue, sputum, and bronchial fluid has been demonstrated. In over 2,250 patients treated with ampicillin/sulbactam, the rate of discontinuance of treatment because of side effects was less than 1%. Satisfactory clinical and bacteriologic outcome has been reported in over 80% of patients treated with ampicillin/sulbactam. The cost of ampicillin/sulbactam treatment is generally lower than that of other comparable antibiotic regimens.
