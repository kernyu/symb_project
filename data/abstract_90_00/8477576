To assess the potential clinical utility of RP 59500, 10 investigators from separate locations in the United States and Canada each tested approximately 200 current isolates of staphylococci (Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci) by a standard protocol. RP 59500 was highly active (MIC90 < or = 2 micrograms/ml) against all strains, including those that were resistant to oxacillin, ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, and spiramycin.
