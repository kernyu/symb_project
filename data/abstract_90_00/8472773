One hundred and ninety-two strains of Neisseria gonorrhoeae isolated from migrant mine-workers were tested for their susceptibility to antibiotics, auxotyped and serotyped. Of the total, 93 (48%) were acquired locally and 64 (33%) from different geographical locations. Plasmid-mediated resistance to penicillin was found in 28 (14.6%) strains and was associated predominantly with the presence of 5.0 kb penicillinase encoding plasmid (18/28, 64%). Chromosomal resistance to penicillin (MIC > or = 1 mg/l) was detected in 14 (7.3%) strains. Resistance to tetracycline was chromosomally and not plasmid-mediated. Antibiotic resistance was encountered most commonly among strains acquired in Natal. The overall gonococcal population was sensitive to ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, spectinomycin and azithromycin. Nine auxotype/serovar (A/S) classes were encountered among penicillinase-producing N. gonorrhoeae (PPNG) compared to 24 A/S classes among non-PPNG strains. The most common A/S class was NR/IA-6 which accounted for 38% of PPNG and 15% of non-PPNG.
