Travelers to malarious areas of the world should take precautions against mosquito bites and take medications to prevent the disease. Chloroquine is the prophylactic agent of choice in areas where malaria remains sensitive. If no contraindications exist, mefloquine is recommended in areas where chloroquine resistance occurs. Alternative regimens would include doxycycline taken as the sole prophylactic agent, or weekly chloroquine with a treatment dose of Fansidar to be taken if symptoms compatible with malaria occur.
