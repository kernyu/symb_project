Ofloxacin is a new fluoroquinolone with a spectrum of activity similar to other fluoroquinolones with activity which includes Chlamydia trachomatis, Mycobacterium spp., Mycoplasma spp. and Legionella pneumophila. Through its additional mechanisms of action, ofloxacin may be less susceptible to the development of resistance from Staphylococcus aureus commonly seen with currently available fluoroquinolones. The impact of these findings cannot be evaluated without further clinical experience. The pharmacokinetics of ofloxacin are characterised by almost complete bioavailability (95 to 100%), peak serum concentrations in the range of 2 to 3 mg/L after a 400mg oral dose and an average half-life of 5 to 8h. In comparison with other available quinolones, elimination is more highly dependent on renal clearance, which may lead to more frequent dosage adjustments in patients with impaired renal function. Ofloxacin appears less likely to affect the pharmacokinetics of drugs (e.g. theophylline) which commonly interact with fluoroquinolones such as ciprofloxacin and enoxacin. The properties of ofloxacin make it a therapeutic alternative to currently available fluoroquinolones.
