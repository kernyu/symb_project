Antibiotic resistant Klebsiella spp. were found to be widely distributed in coastal waters of seas to which sewage was discharged: 69.9 and 85.9%, in the waters of the Baltic and Caspian seas, respectively, the number of the strains with multiple resistance was 18.1 and 19.9%, respectively. Among the Klebsiella spp. with multiple resistance, 40% from the Baltic sea and 58.1% from the Caspian sea had conjugative R plasmids. Statistically significant regional differences in the content of antibiotic resistant Klebsiella spp. and the pattern of their antibiotic resistance were shown.
