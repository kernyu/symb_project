Since 1988 a number of reports on the emergence of vancomycin-resistant enterococci have been published. We describe an additional case of colonization of and subsequent infection with a vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis in a bone-marrow transplant recipient, who had never before received vancomycin therapy. The strain was resistant to most antibiotics tested, including low-level resistance to gentamicin and cross-resistance to teicoplanin. It was sensitive to amoxicillin and the lipopeptide antibiotic daptomycin. The origin, the mode of acquisition and the incidence of vancomycin-resistant enterococci are still unknown. The clinical and bacteriological features of the cases reported thus far and the genetic and biochemical basis of vancomycin resistance are discussed.
