In this study, biochemical properties of two extracellular beta-lactamases produced by penicillin-resistant Streptococcus thermophilus cells were investigated. Both beta-lactamases showed specificity for penicillins but not for cephaloridins. The beta-lactamases exhibited different affinities for penicillin G. The one with the higher molecular weight (FI) had a Km value of 3.44 microM and a Vmax value of 8.33 mumol/min/mg of protein, whereas the beta-lactamase with the lower molecular weight (FII) had a Km value of 4.76 microM and a Vmax value of 3.13 mumol/min/mg of protein. Both beta-lactamases were inhibited by iodine, copper sulfate, and iron sulfate but not by EDTA. The optimal pH ranged between 6 and 7, and the optimal temperatures were between 40 and 45 degrees C for both enzymes.
