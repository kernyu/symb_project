Mice were infected intravenously with three fluconazole susceptible and ten fluconazole resistant isolates of Candida albicans then treated with escalating doses of 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2.5, 10 and 40 mg/kg/day of the new antifungal triazole, ZD0870, for 10 days. A minimum protective dose of < 0.25 mg/kg was determined for infections introduced by the three fluconazole susceptible C. albicans and one of the fluconazole resistant isolates whereas doses ranging from 2.5 to 10 mg/kg/day were required for infections induced by seven of the resistant isolates and > or = 40 mg/kg/day for the remainder. Thus, infections caused by fluconazole resistant C. albicans may be successfully treated with ZD0870, though higher doses than those used to treat infections due to susceptible yeast may be required.
