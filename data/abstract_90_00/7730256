Sensitivity to Yersinia pestis bacteriocin pesticin correlates with the existence of two groups of human pathogenic yersiniae, mouse lethal and mouse nonlethal. The presence of the outer membrane pesticin receptor (FyuA) in mouse-lethal yersiniae is a prerequisite for pesticin sensitivity. Genes that code for FyuA (fyuA) were identified and sequenced from pesticin-sensitive bacteria, including Y. enterocolitica biotype 1B (serotypes O8; O13, O20, and O21), Y. pseudotuberculosis serotype O1, Y. pestis, two known pesticin-sensitive Escherichia coli isolates (E. coli Phi and E. coli CA42), and two newly discovered pesticin-sensitive isolates, E. coli K49 and K235. A 2,318-bp fyuA sequence was shown to be highly conserved in all pesticin-sensitive bacteria, including E. coli strains (DNA sequence homology was 98.5 to 99.9%). The same degree of DNA homology (97.8 to 100%) was established for the sequenced 276-bp fragment of the irp2 gene that encodes high-molecular-weight protein 2, which is also thought to be involved in the expression of virulence by Yersinia species. Highly conserved irp2 was also found in all pesticin-sensitive E. coli strains. On the basis of the fyuA and irp2 sequence homologies, two evolutionary groups of highly pathogenic Yersinia species can be established. One group includes Y. enterocolitica biotype 1B strains, while the second includes Y. pestis, Y. pseudotuberculosis serotype O1, and irp2-positive Y. pseudotuberculosis serotype O3 strains. E. coli Phi, CA42, K49, and K235 belong to the second group. The possible proximity of these two iron-regulated genes (fyuA and irp2), as well as their high levels of sequence conservation and similar G+C contents (56.2 and 59.8 mol%), leads to the assumption that these two genes may represent part of an unstable pathogenicity island that has been acquired by pesticin-sensitive bacteria as a result of a horizontal transfer.
