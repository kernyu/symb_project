Resistance of cytomegalovirus (CMV) to antiviral agents is a well-recognized phenomenon that has been observed in the laboratory and in the clinical setting. Infections caused by antiviral-resistant CMV have been found exclusively among immunocompromised individuals, including patients with AIDS, bone marrow and solid-organ transplant recipients, and patients with hematologic malignancies, and in individuals with primary immunodeficiencies. The majority of these infections have been described to occur in patients with AIDS receiving prolonged antiviral therapy for CMV end-organ disease. Antiviral agents currently licensed for the treatment of CMV infections include ganciclovir, foscarnet, and cidofovir. Resistance of CMV to ganciclovir is related to mutations in the UL97 region of the viral genome and/or mutations in the viral DNA polymerase. Resistance to foscarnet and cidofovir is associated with mutations in the viral DNA polymerase. Antiviral susceptibility of CMV strains containing DNA polymerase mutations is dependent on the region of the DNA polymerase where the mutations are located. Some DNA polymerase mutant viruses are cross-resistant to ganciclovir, foscarnet, and cidofovir. The recognition that specific UL97 and UL54 mutations are associated with resistance to antiviral agents has led to the development of molecular methods for detection of mutant viruses. This article reviews the mechanisms of resistance of CMV to antiviral agents, the laboratory methods for detection of resistant CMV, and the clinical aspects of infections caused by antiviral-resistant CMV.
