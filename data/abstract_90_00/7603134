The purpose of this research was to determine serological types of Pseudomonas aeruginosa according to Habs and their susceptibility to various antibiotics. The material consisted of 316 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated in the period from November 1, 1988 to March 30, 1990. Among 259 strains isolated from patients treated in operative wards, the immunotype P 16 (28.18%) was most frequent. Among 57 strains isolated from patients treated in non-operative wards, the immunotype P 16 (36.84%) was also most frequent. The majority of isolated strains were resistant to a number of applied antimicrobial drugs. Such antibiotics as netilmicin, imipenem, amikacin, ceftazidime, carbenicillin and timentin proved to be most effective.
