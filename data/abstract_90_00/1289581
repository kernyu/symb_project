Cefprozil (CFPZ, BMY-28100), a new oral cephalosporin, was evaluated for its antibacterial activity and clinical efficacy. Thirty-four patients were treated with 7.7-36.2 mg/kg per day of CFPZ divided into 3 times. A total of 33 patients including 3 with acute pneumonia, 2 with acute bronchitis, 17 with acute upper respiratory tract infections, 4 with urinary tract infections, 1 with suppurative lymphadenitis and 6 with other soft tissue infections were evaluated for clinical efficacy except for 1 patient whose general conditions were too serious to continue to be treated with orally medication. Clinical effects were excellent in 8 patients and good in 23 but 2 cases were excluded because they were suspected for viral infections, hence the overall efficacy rate was 100%. Bacteriological responses were confirmed on 6 (66.7%) strains which were eradicated by the treatment out of 9 strains identified. CFPZ showed stronger antibacterial activities than those of cefaclor. Side effects or abnormal laboratory test results were observed in 2 patients; nausea and pallor of face in 1 patient and an increase of eosinophil in 1. The above findings suggest that CFPZ is a safe and useful antibiotics for the treatment of bacterial infections in pediatric patients.
