The effectiveness of eight antibiotics against 30 human isolates of actinomycetoma agents belonging to 7 different species were tested by agar dilution and disc diffusion methods to evaluate the susceptibility patterns and to study drug resistance among the organisms. It was found that many of the isolates had developed partial or complete resistance to conventionally used antibiotics like cotrimoxazole, streptomycin and ampicillin, but almost all were sensitive to amikacin and ciprofloxacin. The two methods were equally effective for detecting sensitivity patterns of the Nocardia isolates.
