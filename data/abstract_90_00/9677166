OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of lamivudine (3TC) on syncytium-inducing (SI) and non-SI (NSI) HIV-1 populations in vivo. DESIGN: Responses in virus load and 3TC resistance in 40 3TC-treated subjects were analysed in relation to the presence or absence of SI HIV-1 variants. METHODS: Peripheral blood samples were collected at regular intervals from 40 HIV-1-infected subjects during 3TC treatment. Virus isolates obtained at the start of treatment were typed for SI-capacity by coculture with MT-2 cells. Changes in levels of viral RNA in plasma were determined by quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR. The relative amount of wild-type and mutant virus at codon 184, associated with HIV resistance to 3TC, was determined using a primer-guided nucleotide incorporation assay after amplification of part of the reverse transcriptase gene. In five subjects the frequency of productively infected CD4+ cells with SI or NSI variants was determined in relation to codon 184 genotype. RESULTS: Twenty-six subjects harboured only NSI variants at baseline, whereas 14 subjects also harboured SI variants. Although baseline plasma viral RNA load and CD4 cell counts were different between the two groups, no differences in the response to 3TC therapy were observed for these parameters. In-depth analysis of five subjects showed that the kinetics of virus load changes and emergence of 3TC resistance mutations were similar in plasma and cells, and comparable for the SI and NSI populations present in one individual. CONCLUSIONS: These data show that, in contrast to didanosine and zidovudine, the pressure exerted by 3TC is similar for SI and NSI M184 populations.
