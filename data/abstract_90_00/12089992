The comparative study of two groups of children suffering from acquired or congenital toxoplasmosis, being in hospital during two different decades (1979-1985--39 children and 1991-1997--117 children) proved: the fact that atypical or subclinical manifestations of the acquired toxoplasmosis (54%) draws our attention to the systematic research of the infection with Toxoplasma gondii, especially at the groups with increased risk now that the frequency of the diseases generating immunodeficiency; the increased frequency of congenital toxoplasmosis (5% in the first group, 8% in the second group) and especially of the invalidating of screening tests to the pregnant women; the therapeutic arsenal limited by the rate price/toxicity/medical resistance, must be individualized for each case, taking into account the increased number of other associated diseases (chronic hepatitis B 7%, TB 17%, HIV infection 5%); Rovamicine treatment at the second group had similar results to those obtained by administrating Pirimetamine--Trimetoprim to the children from the first group.
