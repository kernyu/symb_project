Experiments were performed to study the effect of alcohol on natural immunity of Swiss albino mice during Ancylostoma caninum infection. Natural resistance is lowered in alcoholic mice; 40% alcohol by mouth produced significant effect after 20 daily injections. The effect of the drug on natural immunity depended upon the concentration and the period of consumption. Animals retained maximum number of larvae during alcohol treatment.
