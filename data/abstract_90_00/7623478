Ethanolic extract of Cassia alata leaves was investigated for its antimicrobial activities on several microorganisms including bacteria, yeast, dermatophytic fungi and non-dermatophytic fungi. In vitro, the extract exhibited high activity against various species of dermatophytic fungi but low activity against non-dermatophytic fungi. However, bacterial and yeast species showed resistance against in vitro treatment with the extract. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of the extract revealed that Trichophyton mentagorphytes var. interdigitale, Trichophyton mentagrophytes var. mentagorophytes, Trichophyton rubrum and Microsporum gypseum had the MIC of 125 mg/ml, whereas Microsporum canis had the MIC of 62.5 mg/ml. The inhibition can be observed on the macroconidia of Microsporum gypseum which resulted in structural degeneration beyond repair. The mechanism of inhibition can be related to the cell leakage as observed by irregular, wrinkle shape and loss in rigidity of the macroconidia.
