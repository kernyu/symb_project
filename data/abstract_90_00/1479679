A patient of subarachnoid hemorrhage was treated with spinal CSF drainage. Serratia marcescens meningitis occurred because of the spinal CSF drainage. The organism was multiresistant and refractory to antibiotics including piperacillin, imipenem, gentamicin and cephaloridine. It was sensitive to ceftazidime (CAZ). Treatment with CAZ resulted in clinical improvement associated with rapid clearing of the organism from CSF. CAZ serum level was high enough and CAZ penetration into the CSF was satisfactory. According to the evaluation of CAZ concentrations in serum and CSF, two regimens of treatment were recommended. One is an administration of CAZ 1 g x 4 times/day. Another is a combination with CAZ administration 2 g x 2 times/day and followed by 1 g x 4 times/day. The results suggest that CAZ is an extremely effective antibiotic for meningitis caused by CAZ-susceptible bacteria.
