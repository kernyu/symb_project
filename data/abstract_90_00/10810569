During the period 1990-91, 3222 Salmonella strains were identified at the National Salmonella and Escherichia Centre (NSEC) at Central Research Institute, Kasauli. Of these, 2894 were from humans, 226 from poultry, 84 from animals and remaining 18 from reptiles, birds and other sources. These strains belonged to 53 different serotypes. These include 4 serotypes reported for the first time in India, namely S. kedogou, S. VP. bornheim, S. kisarawe and S. madras. Drug resistance studies revealed that 573 strains were sensitive to all the antibiotics commonly used, 1351 single drug resistant, 594 resistant to two drugs and 704 were multidrug resistant. One strain from human stool was resistant to all the antibiotics used. Prevalence of various Salmonella serotypes and their response to various drugs is discussed.
