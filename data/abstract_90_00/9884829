Enterococci with gentamicin MICs of 256 to 1,024 micrograms/mL were evaluated for susceptibility to ampicillin plus gentamicin synergism. Sixteen of eighteen enterococcal isolates were not susceptible to synergistic killing by ampicillin plus gentamicin; 11 possessed aac(6')-aph(2"), and 4 possessed aph(2")-Ic. A gentamicin MIC of 512 or 1,024 micrograms/mL predicted lack of ampicillin/gentamicin synergism, but a gentamicin MIC of 256 micrograms/mL did not. For six enterococcal strains possessing the gentamicin-resistance gene aph(2")-Ic, ampicillin plus dibekacin, ampicillin plus netilmicin, and ampicillin plus amikacin produced synergistic killing in five, three, and two strains, respectively.
