By means of 5 case reports the successful use of an new blood schizontocide against plasmodium falciparum infections is demonstrated. The local patients with severe malaria were treated in the German UN-hospital in Cambodia. Cerebral, pulmonary and haemolytic complications dominated. Intramuscularly artemether, a synthetic Qinghaosu-derivative, was combined with already used antimalarials. All patients survived, regained consciousness and were without fever after administering artemether within 48 to 72 hours. The complications were controlled by mandatory ventilation, blood transfusions, fluid balance and blood sugar monitoring. With artemether we will get a well tolerated and quickly effective schizontocide. In order to avoid recrudenscence and fast drug resistance it should be combined with a tetracycline and in consequence supplemented through a second schizontocide.
