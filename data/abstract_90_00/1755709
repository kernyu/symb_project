There was an increase in the resistance of clinical isolates to piperacillin as compared to that in 1987-1988. It was shown on the kinetic models that there was difference in the effect of the inhibitory and subinhibitory concentrations of the drug on microorganisms in various growth phases. No post-antibiotic action against Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and a slightly pronounced dose-dependent effect with respect to Escherichia coli were noted.
