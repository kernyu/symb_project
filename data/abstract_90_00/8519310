The present study was undertaken to investigate the occurrence of antibiotic resistance in enteric flora in 64 children in rural Bangladesh over a 12-month period. The antibiotic resistance pattern of the isolates varied throughout the year and multiple resistance was highest during the post monsoon period. Seventy-three percent of children had isolates resistant to more than three antibiotics throughout the year. Resistance to streptomycin was highest (78%), followed closely by ampicillin (72%). Of 82 multiply resistant isolates, plasmid DNA was demonstrated in 75%. Plasmid sizes ranged between 3.7 and 110 MDa, the commonest plasmids were of 70, 98 and 110 MDa. Complete or partial resistance was transferred by conjugation from 52% of the isolates, most frequently by single plasmids. The commonest plasmid incompatibility group was F11-A (46%) followed by incompatibility group P (22%). Plasmids of molecular weight 98 MDa most often hybridized with F11-A probes and those of 110 MDa with H11 probes. Plasmids from 10 transconjugants were digested with restriction enzymes and digest patterns demonstrated the presence of common plasmids. The findings show that there is a diverse, and mobile, genetic pool of resistance genes in this rural community. This genetic reservoir is potentially transferable to enteric pathogens, with major implications for public health and diarrhoeal disease control.
