METHODS: Seventy-seven chronic duodenal ulcer patients (50 male) were entered into this study. Treatment was started with sucralfate suspension (2 g b.d.) for 8 weeks. After 2 weeks the patients also received 750 mg amoxycillin t.d.s. plus 500 mg metronidazole t.d.s. for 12 days. Endoscopy with six antral biopsies (urease test, Gram staining, culture and histology) was performed before commencement of sucralfate therapy, 4 weeks after the end of antibiotic therapy, and during the follow-up examinations at 6 and 12 months. RESULTS: Seven patients were excluded prematurely from the study. Helicobacter pylori in five patients had primary resistance to metronidazole and these patients were also excluded. The ulcer healing rate 4 weeks after the end of antibiotic therapy was 92% and the H. pylori eradication rate was 82% (all per protocol). In all patients who were still H. pylori-positive, the bacterium became resistant to metronidazole and histologically the inflammatory state of the mucosa was the same as before treatment. All H. pylori-eradicated patients (n = 53) were re-examined after 6 and 12 months; no ulcer recurrence was observed and each time only one reinfection was found. CONCLUSIONS: In an open study, sucralfate with amoxycillin and metronidazole appeared to act together to eradicate H. pylori infection and to speed duodenal ulcer healing.
