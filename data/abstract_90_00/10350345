We treated 14 patients with advanced, resistant chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) including three with >10% prolymphocytes (CLL/PL) with high dose methyl prednisolone (HDMP). All patients had stage C CLL or bulky stage B disease. There were 11 males and 3 females with a median age of 58.5 years (range: 49-69). Six out of eleven CLL patients had a partial response as defined by the NCI guidelines, no patient had a complete remission. The mean duration of PR was 19.6 months with a median of 8 months (range 6-78). Seven patients have died including the 5 non-responders. None of the 3 patients with CLL/PL had a measurable response. Previous treatments included chlorambucil, fludarabine, deoxycoformycin, anthracycline containing regimens such as CHOP and Campath-1H. HDMP was given at a dose of 1 g/m2 for five days, at monthly intervals for one to seven courses depending on the response. H2 antagonists and antimicrobial prophylaxis were given concurrently. Acyclovir prophylaxis was given if there was a recent history of herpes infection. HDMP was generally well tolerated. Side effects included fluid retention, hyperglycaemia, bradycardia (1 patient), herpes simplex (1), and pneumonia (1) in a patient with a previous history of recurrent chest infection and pneumonia. These results suggest that HDMP may be beneficial in the treatment of refractory CLL but is of no value in CLL/PL.
