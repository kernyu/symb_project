The in vitro activity of ticarcillin, ticarcillin-clavulanic acid, piperacillin, piperacillin-tazobactam, cefsulodin, ceftazidime, cefepime, cefpirome and aztreonam was evaluated against 130 isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa with various beta-lactam phenotypes. MICs were determined by the agar dilution method and inhibition method and inhibition zones by the disk test. The resistance mechanisms were characterized by the iodometric method. The activity of cefepime was greater than that of cefpirome whatever the resistance phenotype. Some ticarcillin-susceptible strains were intermediate to cefepime and cefpirome. Most strains with a penicillinase or "intrinsic resistance" phenotype were susceptible to ceftazidime but intermediate to cefepime and cefpirome. Only 10% of cephalosporinase-over-producing strains remained susceptible to cefepime.
