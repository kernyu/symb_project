Seven hundred and eighty three isolates of Staphylococcus aureus isolated from pus (586), blood (78), sputum (25), urine (23), cerebrospinal fluid (23) and various other body fluids (48) were subjected to in-vitro antimicrobial susceptibility testing by modified Kirby-Bauer method. Almost all the isolates were resistant to penicillin (99.62 per cent) and ampicillin (99.62 per cent). Resistance to erythromycin, tetracycline and cotrimoxazole was observed in 88.5, 87.62, and 80.85 per cent isolates respectively. Resistance to gentamicin was 68.32 per cent. Resistance to most of the commonly used antimicrobial agents indicates a need to replace these drugs with other agents and maintenance of surveillance to detect changing patterns of resistance.
