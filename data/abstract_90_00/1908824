Five alternative methods were used to explore in vitro the effects of normal and activated murine macrophages on the metabolic well-being of intracellular Mycobacterium leprae: fluorescein diacetate-ethidium bromide staining, ATP content, synthesis of phenolic glycolipid 1, and two techniques to quantitate oxidation of palmitic acid. In relatively short-term experiments (7 to 10 days), each of these procedures provided strong evidence that activated macrophages exerted a deleterious effect on the leprosy bacillus. These findings appear to confirm the contention that activated macrophages underlie host resistance to clinical leprosy and limitation of M. leprae growth in paucibacillary leprosy.
