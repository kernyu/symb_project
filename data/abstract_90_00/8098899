An average of 840 East African Zebu cattle from nine herds in the Ghibe valley, southwest Ethiopia were monitored from January 1986 to April 1990. Each month blood samples were collected for analysis of packed red cell volume (PCV) and detection of trypanosomes. Animals found to be parasitaemic and with a PCV less than 26% were treated with diminazene aceturate at a dose of 3.5 mg/kg body weight. The majority of infections were associated with Trypanosoma congolense (84% of infections in adult cattle and 71% in cattle less than 24 months of age), and the mean percentage of adult animals detected parasitaemic 1 month after treatment of an infection with T. congolense was 27%. In order to assess possible existence of drug resistance, a model was applied which allowed monthly incidences of new infections to be distinguished from recurrent infections. This model showed that the monthly incidence of new infections of T. congolense in adult cattle increased significantly from 11% in 1986 to 24% in 1989 following a concomitant increase in the tsetse challenge. The corresponding increase in overall prevalence of T. congolense was from 17% to 38% and the mean prevalence of recurrent infections increased significantly from 6% to 14%. These findings ruled out the possibility that the high prevalence of trypanosome infections in cattle was due only to a high tsetse challenge and pointed to the existence of T. congolense populations which expressed resistance to diminazene. There were variations associated with season, herd, age and sex in the incidence of new infections, prevalence of recurrent infections and relapse to treatment.
