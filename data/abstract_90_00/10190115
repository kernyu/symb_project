In this work, the production of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) during interaction of human phagocytes with the intracellular parasite Leishmania major was further investigated. The human monocytic cell line U937, differentiated with a combination of 1 alpha, 25 dihydroxyvitamin D3 (VD) and retinoic acid (RA), or with granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) was used. Differentiated U937 cells were infected with Leishmania major promastigotes, and TNF alpha was assayed in cell culture supernatants. It was found that the cytokine was produced only by U937 cells differentiated with VD/RA and further incubated with GM-CSF and LPS or interferon gamma (IFN gamma). L. major induced TNF alpha production only in the presence of GM-CSF. No direct relationship was found, however, between production of TNF alpha and resistance of differentiated U937 cells to infection with L. major.
