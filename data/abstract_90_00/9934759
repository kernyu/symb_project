Patients with malabsorption and histological findings consistent with celiac disease, who are unresponsive to gluten free diet, and in whom other causes of flat mucosa have been excluded, are considered to suffer from so called unclassified or refractory sprue. Although the true nature of this condition needs to be further elucidated, it is known to represent a difficult therapeutical problem with potentially fatal course. Herein, we report a patient with refractory sprue-like disease who after failing to respond to corticosteroids and TPN was in a critical condition. He responded promptly to cyclosporine and made a remarkable recovery. In contrast to previous reports, the cyclosporine treatment in this patient was pursued only for 1 month, whereupon the patient turned responsive to steroids. Subsequent treatment with azathioprine allowed corticosteroids to be reduced to a low maintenance dose and eventually all drugs could be discontinued without reappearance of symptoms. Cyclosporine therapy might be lifesaving in occasional patients with refractory sprue-like disease and it may result in reversal of steroid resistance. Moreover, azathioprine seems to have a steroid sparing effect in this setting. Short term immunosuppressive treatment may have an advantage of lower risk for drug related side effects.
