A strain of Vibrio cholerae non-O1 was isolated from a 48-year-old male in California who presented with a chief complaint of watery diarrhea. Laboratory investigations of this strain revealed the bacterium to be resistant to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and to the vibriostatic agent O/129 (2,4-diamino-6,7-diisopropylpteridine).
