Klebsiella pneumoniae clinical isolates were selected according to the results of antibiotic susceptibility tests. Most of them were resistant to multiple antibiotics, including ampicillin, ceftazidime, cefotaxime and aminoglycosides. Large plasmids were observed in these Kl. pneumoniae strains by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis with S1 nuclease digestion. The Kl. pneumoniae strains investigated produced one to two extrachromosomal bands with a mobility corresponding to 97 approximately 145 kbp linear DNA molecules. A 100 kbp plasmid, designated pK1, was observed in the multiply resistant strain K250. pK1 had sequences homologous to both the TEM-1 and the aphD probe which were associated with beta-lactam and aminoglycoside resistance. pK1 was transformed into Escherichia coli strain DH5alpha and was found to confer resistance to ampicillin, ceftazidime, cefotaxime and kanamycin. A 8 kbp BamHI DNA fragment of pK1 that carried the ampicillin resistance gene (minimum inhibitory concentration > 1000 microgram ml-1) was cloned into the BamHI site of pACYC184. Sequence determination showed that this cloned fragment carried a TEM-1 gene. These findings suggest that pK1 is novel in that it appears to carry genes for resistance to ampicillin, cefotaxime and ceftazidime, as well as kanamycin.
