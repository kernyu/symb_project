The production and roles of endogenous gamma interferon (IFN-gamma), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in both lethal and nonlethal infections of Staphylococcus aureus were investigated in mice. In the case of nonlethal infection, although no bacteria were detected in the bloodstreams, bacteria that colonized and proliferated persistently for 3 weeks were found in the kidneys. All mice given lethal injections died within 7 days, and large numbers of bacteria were detected in the bloodstreams, spleens, and kidneys. The first peaks of IFN-gamma, TNF, and IL-6 were observed in the bloodstreams and spleens of the mice with nonlethal and lethal infections within 24 h. Thereafter, in the nonlethal cases, IFN-gamma, TNF, and IL-6 peaked again in the spleens and kidneys during the period of maximum growth of bacteria in the kidneys, although only IL-6 was detected in the sera. In contrast, in the case of lethal infection, the titers of IFN-gamma and IL-6 in the sera and TNF in the kidneys peaked before death. Effects of in vivo administration of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against IFN-gamma and TNF on the fates of S. aureus-infected mice were studied. In the nonlethal infections, anti-TNF alpha (anti-TNF-alpha) MAb-treated mice, but not anti-IFN-gamma MAb-treated mice, died as a result of worsening infection, suggesting that endogenous TNF plays a protective role in host resistance to S. aureus infection. In the mice that received lethal doses, injection of anti-TNF-alpha MAb accelerated death. However, although injection of anti-IFN-gamma MAb inhibited host resistance of the infected mice early in infection, most of the animals survived the lethal infection by injection of anti-IFN-gamma MAb, suggesting that endogenous IFN-gamma plays a detrimental role in S. aureus infection. Thus, this study demonstrated that IFN-gamma and TNF play different roles in S. aureus infection.
