OBJECTIVE: Determine the epidemiology and risk factors for colonization with vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium. DESIGN: Survey; case-control study. SETTING: Children's hospital. PATIENTS: Pediatric oncology patients. INTERVENTION: Contact isolation, restriction of vancomycin prescribing. RESULTS: There was a high prevalence of colonization with vancomycin-resistant enterococci among pediatric oncology patients. The length of hospitalization and the administration of vancomycin and other intravenous antibiotics was associated with colonization. Prevention of colonization was associated with restriction of vancomycin use and contact isolation. CONCLUSIONS: Vancomycin use may predispose to colonization with vancomycin-resistant E faecium. Vancomycin-resistant E faecium may be nosocomially spread. Contact isolation and restriction of vancomycin use may prevent spread of vancomycin-resistant E faecium.
