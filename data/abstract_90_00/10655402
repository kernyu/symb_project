Antifungal susceptibilities were determined from 80 urinary isolates of Candida species collected in 1994 and 1998. Our findings demonstrate increasing geometric means of fluconazole MICs and fluconazole resistance in Candida albicans and Candida tropicalis (those for Candida glabrata were unchanged) within the 4-year span. Amphotericin B and voriconazole MICs remained constant.
