We report the first year's experience of the use of a radiometric technique for sensitivity testing of mycobacterial isolates in Scotland. The techniques (using the Bactec 460 instrument) was much quicker than conventional methods (for example the mean time to obtain results for 60 strains of M.tuberculosis was 14.4 days, compared with 44.9 days for conventional methods). There was good agreement between results obtained by the two methods. Preliminary results also indicated the value of the radiometric technique for rapid isolation of mycobacteria from clinical samples (mean of 10.6 days with the radiometric technique compared with 26.7 days using egg media) although for optimal recovery, both techniques should be used in parallel.
