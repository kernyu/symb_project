In this study, we report the further characterization of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae crystal violet-resistance protein Sge1. Sge1 is a highly hydrophobic 59 kDa protein with 14 predicted membrane-spanning domains. It shares homologies with several drug-resistance proteins and sugar transporters of the major facilitator superfamily. Here, we have demonstrated that Sge1 is not only a crystal violet-resistance protein, but that it also confers resistance to ethidium bromide and methylmethane sulfonate. Disruption of SGE1 leads to increased sensitivity towards all three compounds, thus designating Sge1 as a multiple drug-resistance protein. Subcellular fractionation as well as immunolocalization on whole yeast cells demonstrated that Sge1 was tightly associated with the yeast plasma membrane. Furthermore, Sge1 was highly enriched in preparations of yeast plasma membranes. In analogy to other multidrug-resistance proteins, we suggest that Sge1 functions as a drug export permease.
