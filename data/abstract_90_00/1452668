The prevalence of colonization by Staphylococcus saprophyticus of the urogenital tracts of 276 women from an outpatient gynecology practice was determined by using selective and enrichment culture techniques. Nineteen subjects (6.9%) were found to be colonized by S. saprophyticus. The rectum was the most frequent site of colonization and was responsible for 40% of the isolates; this was followed in decreasing order by the urethra, urine, and cervix. Women colonized by S. saprophyticus were more likely to have experienced a urinary tract infection in the previous 12 months (P = 0.058; odds ratio, 2.844; 95% confidence interval, 1.054 to 7.671). Patients colonized by S. saprophyticus tended to have had their menstrual periods more recently (P = 0.066), experienced sexual intercourse more recently (P = 0.168), and had a recent or concurrent diagnosis of vaginal candidiasis (P = 0.111; odds ratio, 2.393; 95% confidence interval, 0.877 to 6.528). A seasonal variation in colonization was observed, with colonization most likely occurring during the summer and fall. Follow-up for an average of 6.75 months failed to document any colonized woman progressing to symptomatic urinary tract infection. In addition, 21 women colonized by non-S. saprophyticus, novobiocin-resistant, coagulase-negative staphylococci were identified and characterized.
