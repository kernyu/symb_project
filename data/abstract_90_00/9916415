Two hundreds and twenty-six children under five years of age with pneumonia were recruited from an urban poor area in Nairobi, Kenya, and examined for pathogens for 1 year from February 1997. One hundred and twenty-eight of the 226 patients were pathogen-positive cases. The patients under 1-year-old were 61.8% of the pathogen-positive cases. A total 192 organisms were isolated from 128 pathogen-positive patients. Streptococcus pneumoniae had the highest prevalence rate of 31.3%, followed by respiratory syncytial virus with 10.4%, Candida albicans with 9.9%, Moraxella (B) catarrhalis with 7.8%. In S. pneumoniae, 66.7% of the organism was resistant to oxacillin. It was also shown that 51.1% and 65.1% of the S. pneumoniae strains were resistant to gentamicin and trimethoprim/sulfam, respectively. From these results, it is clear that a lot of multi-drug resistant S. pneumoniae strains including penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae were frequently detected in an urban poor area.
