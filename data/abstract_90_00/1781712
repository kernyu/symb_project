The data on the efficacy of antibacterial drugs and their combinations in treatment of 150 three-month old infants with generalized infection due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa are presented. The clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa were found to be carriers of multiple drug resistance which markedly complicated the chemotherapy. Only combined antibacterial therapy of such infants proved to be rational. High activity of aminoglycosides, azlocillin and cefotaxime against P. aeruginosa and the synergistic action of their combinations observed in the patients permitted to recommend the use of combinations of the above drugs in the empirical chemotherapy.
