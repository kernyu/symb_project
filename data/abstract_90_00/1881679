Susceptibility to beta-lactam antibiotics of strains of Enterobacteriaceae consecutively isolated in nine general hospitals during a period of 2 months (march and april) has been studied by the disk-agar diffusion method. The separation between susceptible and resistant strains was based on the measure of the inhibition zones centered by 2 disks: cephalothin and ticarcillin. Enterobacteriaceae were divided in 2 groups: strains isolated during the first 48 h of hospitalisation or isolated after. Fifty one per cent of the strains were isolated during the first 48 h: they did not belong to the residential flora of these hospitals. Klebsiella, Proteus indole positive, Providencia, Enterobacter, Serratia were more frequently isolated after 48 h of hospitalisation. Susceptible strains of Klebsiella, Proteus indole positive, Providencia, Serratia were more rarely isolated after 48 h of hospitalisation. E. coli whatever the duration of hospitalisation, is the less frequent susceptible bacterium.
