A total of 36,780,440 overseas travellers during 1979-1995 (17 years) were quarantined at Osaka and Kansai Airport Quarantine Station, 84,777 travellers reported themselves suffer from diarrhoea. Stools from 29,587 persons were bacteriologically examined. Various enteropathogenic bacteria were isolated from 9,766 (33.0%) patients of the stools examined. Isolated species were as follows: Plesiomonas shigelloides (3,234 cases); Salmonella spp. (2,236 cases); enterotoxgenic Escherichia coli (1,621 cases); Vibrio parahaemolyticus (1,959 cases); and Shigella spp. (1,242 cases). 1,278 different Shigella strains were isolated from 1,242 cases who were thus diagnosed as bacillary dysentery patients. The suspected regions or countries for infection of these cases were analysed. The serovars and antibiotic-sensitivities of the isolated strains were examined. Colicine typing of S. sonnei strains were also done. The results can be summarized as follows. 1) The most cases (53.4%) were infected in India. 2) The percentage distribution of sub-species of the strains was as follows; S. sonnei (57.8%), S flexneri (29.8%), S. boydii (8.4%), and S. dysenteriae (4.0%), respectively. 3) The major colicine type of S. sonnei strains were type 6 and 0. 4) The percentage of Antibiotic-resistant strains of each sub-species was S. dysenteriae (92.2%), S. sonnei (89.4%), S. flexneri (87.1%), and S. boydii (84.9%), respectively. The percentage of Antibiotic-resistant strains of S. flexneri were increased annually.
