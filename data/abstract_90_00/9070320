It has been reported that granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), one of the hemopoietic growth factors which regulates the function of phagocytic cells, is a potent activator of cultured macrophages and induces antimicrobial activities as well as differentiation of precursor cells. In this study, we examined the ability of recombinant murine GM-CSF to activate mouse peritoneal macrophages to restrict the growth of two different microorganisms, Candida albicans and Legionella pneumophila, both of which are important opportunistic pathogens in an immunocompromised host. Treatment of thioglycollate-elicited BDF1 mouse macrophages with GM-CSF for 24 hr enhanced the anti-C. albicans activity of the macrophages in terms of inhibiting growth of the fungi. Reactive oxygen (H2O2) and IL-1 production by the macrophages were also enhanced by treatment with GM-CSF. However, no enhancement of anti-L. pneumophila activity of macrophages obtained from either susceptible A/J or resistant BDF1 mice to L. pneumophila infection after treatment with up to 1000 units/ml GM-CSF was observed under the same conditions. When the treatment time was extended to 72 hr. GM-CSF was still unable to induce anti-L. pneumophila activity. As a control study, treatment with recombinant IFN-gamma enhanced both anti-Candida and anti-Legionella activity in cultured macrophages under the same conditions used in the GM-CSF study. Measurement of cellular iron content revealed the low iron content in IFN-gamma-treated macrophages, but no decrease of iron in GM-CSF-treated macrophages compared with the control group, indicating a possible involvement of iron as a key factor in anti-L. pneumophila activity. Thus, the results of the study show that GM-CSF activation of elicited peritoneal macrophages is selective with regard to the type of antimicrobial activity induced.
