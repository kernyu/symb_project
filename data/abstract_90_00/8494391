We have tested the in vitro activities of streptomycin, rifampin, tetracyclines, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, erythromycin, four new macrolides (roxithromycin, azithromycin, clarithromycin, and dirithromycin), and rifapentine against 62 strains of Brucella spp. Azithromycin and clarithromycin were, respectively, eight- and twofold more active than erythromycins (MIC for 90% of strains = 2, 8, and 16 micrograms/ml, respectively). The activity of rifapentine was similar to that of rifampin (MIC for 90% of strains = 1 microgram/ml).
