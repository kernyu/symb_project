Mycobacterium tuberculosis is an important respiratory pathogen the growth of which is controlled primarily by cytokine-activated macrophages. One of the principal mediators of this control is nitric oxide; however, superoxide has recently been shown to be protective in systemic mycobacterial infections. To determine whether superoxide is important in controlling M. tuberculosis during primary pulmonary infection, mice lacking the cytosolic p47(phox) gene (which is essential for effective superoxide production by the NADPH oxidase) were infected aerogenically. The lack of superoxide during an aerosol infection with M. tuberculosis resulted in a significant increase in bacterial growth over the early period of infection. Once antigen-specific gamma interferon-producing lymphocytes were detected in the draining lymph nodes, however, bacterial growth in the lung stopped. One interesting consequence of the lack of superoxide was an increase in neutrophilic infiltrates within the granuloma. This may be a consequence of increased tissue damage due to more rapid bacterial growth or may reflect a role for superoxide in controlling inflammation.
