Bacterial and fungal infections continue to be a major threat to bone marrow transplant recipients. While standardized approaches to empiric therapy with early inclusion of antibiotics active against Gram-positive organisms and against fungi may have improved the outcome of these patients during the past decade, other developments (e.g. increasing number of patients in older age groups, unrelated donors, mismatch transplants) may even have increased the problem. Current approaches to the prophylaxis and treatment of these infections are discussed. Concerning fungal infections especially the new azoles and new approaches of amphotericin B administration are of interest.
