Malaria still kills some 0.5-2.5 million people per year in the tropics. Resistance to the cheap, most commonly used antimalarials continues to spread alarmingly and could outpace drug development. The artemisinin derivatives have had an important clinical impact both on the treatment of resistant falciparum malaria and on the incidence of disease in low-transmission areas. A few promising new antimalarials are being tested clinically but there is an imperative need for cheap, well-tolerated drugs that can be used in short courses, and for strategies to delay the onset of drug resistance. Bed nets have been shown to reduce the incidence of severe malaria in many areas but an effective vaccine is urgently needed.
