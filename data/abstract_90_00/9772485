OBJECTIVE: To study the changes in patterns and resistances of bacteria from patients with bacteremia in 11 years. METHODS: Diffusion tests were used to measure the antibiotic sensitivity of bacteria isolated from the patients with bacteremia. RESULTS: The proportion of staphylococcus epidermidis in bacteremia increased significantly. The proportion of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in bacteremia caused by staphyiococcus increased markedly. Resistance of MRSA and methlcillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) to penicillin, and gentamycin increased significantly. Compared 1986-1990, with 1991-1996, the resistance of S. epidermidis to penicillin, erythromycin and methicillin increased markedly, so did resistance of pseudomonas aeruginosa to carbenicillin, and piperacillin, resistance of E. coli to gentamycin and cefoperazone, resistance of klebsiella to ampicillin and carbenicillin. The resistance of enterobacteriaceae which induced beta-lactamase to the first to the third generation of cephalosporins was relatively high. CONCLUSION: The resistance of bacteria to the commonly used antibiotics was produced in various degrees.
