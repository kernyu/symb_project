Seven patients co-infected with hepatitis B virus (HBsAg and HBeAg carriers, quantifiable HBV DNA with the bDNA technic) and human immunodeficiency virus received a triple antiretroviral combination therapy, including lamivudine (150 mg twice a day). Hepatitis B viral load rapidly became undetectable in 6/7 patients. It remained below the level of detection in 2 subjects, after 20 and 22 months of treatment, with one of them achieving HBeAg/anti-HBe seroconversion. However, in the other 4 individuals, hepatitis B viremia increased again after 8 to 16 months of lamivudine-containing regimen. The last patient was a non-responder. The 4 relapsers developed a double mutation Leu(528) for Met(528) and Met(552) for Val(552), on hepatitis B virus polymerase, either concomitant (M8 and M16) with a hepatitis B virus DNA increase, or 2 months earlier (M10 and M12). The high frequency of hepatitis B virus resistance to lamivudine emphasizes the necessity of identifying more effective strategies, such as double combination therapies.
