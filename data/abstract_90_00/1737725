The antibiotic susceptibilities of 241 anaerobic bacteria recovered from six geographic sites in North America were tested by agar dilution to cefoperazone-sulbactam and other drugs. Of the 189 Bacteroides fragilis group isolates, only one was resistant to cefoperazone-sulbactam (0.5%) or ampicillin-sulbactam (0.5%), and none was resistant to ticarcillin-clavulanate or chloramphenicol. No resistance to cefoperazone-sulbactam was observed among the other Bacteroides spp., Clostridium spp., or Peptostreptococcus spp. Resistance to cefoperazone-sulbactam is not commonly observed against anaerobic bacteria recovered from different geographical sites across North America.
