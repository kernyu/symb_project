From 1984 to 1989, stool samples from 2811 gastroenteritis cases were examined for the presence of Campylobacter jejuni and C. Coli, Salmonella, Shigella and Yersinia species. Isolation rates were: Campylobacter jejuni and C. Coli, 5.3%, Salmonella spp., 14.8%, Shigella spp., 4.6% and Yersinia enterocolitica, 1.1%. Age group distribution analysis shows a higher Campylobacter isolation rate in children under one year of age. Seasonal distribution revealed a peak incidence in winter as in other Mediterranean countries. Predominant biotypes were C. jejuni I (51%), C. jejuni II (21.5%) and C. coli I (18.8%). Antimicrobial susceptibility testing did not reveal resistance to erythromycin. Thirty of the strains harboured plasmids with 7 different profiles.
