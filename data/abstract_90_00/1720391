Blasticidin S is a microbial antibiotic that inhibits protein synthesis in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. The blasticidin S-resistance gene (bsr), isolated from Bacillus cereus K55-S1 strain, was inserted into pSV2 plasmid vector and introduced into cultured mammalian cells by transfection. The bsr gene was integrated into the genome and conferred blasticidin S resistance on HeLa cells. The transfection frequency of the bsr gene was as high as that of the aminoglycoside phosphotransferase gene, the so-called neo gene, which is a representative selectable marker for mammalian cells. Transfectants in which several copies of bsr had been integrated into the genome were highly resistant to blasticidin S. Furthermore, blasticidin S killed the cells more rapidly than G418, which is conventionally used as a selective drug for the neo gene. Thus bsr is concluded to be useful as a drug-resistance marker for mammalian cells.
