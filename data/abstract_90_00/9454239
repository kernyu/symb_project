The paper provides the results of follow-ups of 269 patients with pulmonary tuberculosis, 170 and 39 isolated drug-resistant or sensitive Mycobacteria tuberculosis (MT), respectively. Drug resistance to MT was found to lower the feasibility of curing the patients, to prolong their cure, and to slow down the rate of decreasing the cohort of tuberculosis patients registered at the dispensary. In the first 5-years of the follow-up, there were lower death rates due to tuberculosis in a group of patients with drug-resistant MT than in those with drug-sensitive one.
