We studied fecal colonization with vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) in 89 HIV-infected nonhospitalized patients ages 24 to 62 years, including 70 (79%) men (including 41 homosexual and 5 bisexual men) and 19 (21%) women. Of the 89 patients, 61 (69%) were black, 25 (28%) Hispanic, and 3 (3%) white; 53 (60%) had history of ongoing or recent antibacterial therapy with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (29), clarithromycin (18), amoxicillin (7), ofloxacin (3), and metronidazole, doxycycline, dicloxacillin, and cephalexin (1 each). VRE were not isolated from any of the patients studied.
