Between July 1983 and December 1987, 13,108 strains of enterobacteriaceae were isolated at Charles Nicolle Hospital in Tunis. This study reports the prevalence of different species isolated, their resistance and the evolution of bacterial resistance during that period. There appeared to be a great stability in the distribution of bacterial groups. Among the commonly sensitive species, Proteus mirabilis showed a high proportion of strains resistant to ampicillin (79.3%), carbenicillin (75.9%), cefalotin (73.8%) and gentamicin (46%). The proportions of resistant strains in P. mirabilis were much the same for each successive year from 1983 to 1987, and the percentages of resistant strains in the majority of the bacterial species were similarly stable. Amikacin and cefotaxime remained the most active antibiotics against enterobacteriaceae.
