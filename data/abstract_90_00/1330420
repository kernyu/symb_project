The in vitro activity of l-ofloxacin was determined against coagulase-negative staphylococci that were induced to norfloxacin resistance. l-Ofloxacin was the most active agent tested with an MIC90 of 4 micrograms/ml compared with greater than 128, 32, and 128 micrograms/ml for norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and enoxacin, respectively. Rifampin-resistant, coagulase-negative staphylococci were not cross-resistant to the quinolones tested. Among the rifampin-resistant organisms tested, l-ofloxacin was also the most active agent with an MIC90 of 0.25 micrograms/ml.
