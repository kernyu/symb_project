Overexpression of P-glycoprotein may cause increased efflux of a variety of anticancer drugs (ACD) leading to multidrug resistance (MDR) of tumor cells. Two sublines of murine monocytic leukemia P388 cells were used, one parental (Par-P388) and one multidrug resistant (MDR-P388). In cell growth inhibition assays in vitro, the Par-P388 cells showed a normal sensitivity to daunomycin (DAU) while the MDR-P388 cells were 200-fold resistant. In cellular fluorescence assays, DAU retention in MDR-P388 cells reached only 5% of the level achieved in Par-P388 cells. This cell line pair was used to compare the nonimmunosuppressive cyclosporin analog PSC 833 with several resistance-modifying agents (RMAs) for their in vitro chemosensitizing activity and for their restoration of DAU retention. PSC 833 sensitized the MDR-P388 cells 60- and 140-fold when used at 0.1 and 0.3 micrograms/ml (0.08 and 0.25 microM), respectively, a complete restoration of sensitivity being obtained at 1.0 micrograms/ml PSC 833. Similarly as little as 0.1 micrograms/ml (0.08 microM) PSC 833 was sufficient to restore intracellular DAU retention to 60% of the level found in Par-P388 cells, a 3-fold higher concentration restoring virtually the whole DAU retention. For both these activities, PSC 833 was at least one order of magnitude more active than CsA, which was itself an order of magnitude stronger than verapamil, another RMA already used in clinic. Since PSC 833 had no effect on the PAR-P388 cells, neither on chemosensitization nor on drug retention, it is assumed that it acts on the P-glycoprotein, which is highly expressed on the membrane of the MDR-P388 cells, by inhibiting the function of the P-glycoprotein pump and thus restoring a normal ACD-sensitivity of the MDR-P388 cells.
