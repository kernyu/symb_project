The bactericidal effect of OPB-2045, a new disinfectant produced from biguanide group compounds, against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), MRSA IID 1677, was investigated by transmission electron microscopy. OPB-2045 showed strong bactericidal activity against MRSA. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of OPB-2045 against the test strain were 0.78 and 1.56 microg mL(-1), respectively. The test bacteria were incubated in the presence of OPB-2045 at 1/2 MIC (0.39 microg mL(-1)), 1 MIC (0.78 microg mL(-1)), 2 MIC (1 MBC, 1.56 microg mL(-1)), 4 MIC (2 MBC, 3.13 microg mL(-1)) or 10 MIC (5 MBC, 7.8 microg mL(-1)) at 37 degrees C for 30 s, 3 min, 30 min or 6h. The morphology of the cells was examined by transmission electron microscopy. The cell damage observed after 30-min or 6-h incubation in the presence of OPB-2045 at 1/2 or 1 MIC was the same as that at 2, 4 or 10 MIC. The numbers of damaged MRSA cells increased according to the increase in concentration of added disinfectant, and the image of bacteriolysis was observed, too. After treatment at 1/2 or 1 MIC, a few leaking cells were recognized, but no destroyed cells were found. No morphological changes were observed after treatment at 1 or 2 MIC for 30 s, 3 min or 30 min. When the incubation time was extended to 6 h, morphological changes in the MRSA cells treated at 1 or 2 MIC were observed. When examining the relationship between the numbers of surviving bacteria and the MIC (MBC) values in soybean casein digest broth, no decrease in MRSA cell numbers was recognized in the untreated control or at 1/2 MIC, but a marked decrease in MRSA cell numbers was recognized as the OPB-2045 concentration was increased. The new disinfectant OPB-2045 would make a useful contribution to the medical field for the prevention of infections caused by pathogenic bacteria such as MRSA.
