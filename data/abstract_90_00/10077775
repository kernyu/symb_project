The results of the semi-annual nationwide surveillance of antimicrobial susceptibilities, conducted by the Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare during the period of January 1993 to July 1995, were analyzed for typical Gram-positive cocci and Gram-negative cocci in the purpose of provision of an index for antimicrobial selection. During these 3 years, Streptococcus pyogenes (group A) and Streptococcus agalactiae (group B) showed slightly increasing tendency in susceptibility to ofloxacin (OFLX) and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (ST), while Streptococcus pneumoniae and Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis showed slightly decreasing tendency to cefaclor (CCL). However, these annual changes were almost negligible. Generally, these microorganisms showed relatively good susceptibilities, every year, to the principal antimicrobial agents being approved for use against Gram-positive and -negative cocci. However, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecalis showed tendencies of decreased susceptibility to some of the antimicrobial agents. On the other hand, cefmetazole (CMZ), vancomycin (VCM), latamoxef (LMOX), ST and minocycline (MINO) showed good activities against some of the Gram-positive and -negative cocci to which no indication are approved. In conclusion, beside the identification of the causative microorganisms and the performance of antimicrobial susceptibility testing, such analyses (graphics of susceptibility tendency of clinical isolates to variety of antimicrobial agents) could be used as an index for selection of antimicrobial agents, when emergent and urgent selection of an antimicrobial agent is necessary.
