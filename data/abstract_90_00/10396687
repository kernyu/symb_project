Investigations on emergence of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VREF) which has recently been attracting attention, especially in the Western countries, have been conducted in Japan. A total of 1,239 isolates of E. faecium were collected from 19 institutions during the period of April 1995 and June 1996, in the purpose of evaluating susceptibilities to variety of antimicrobial agents, including RP59500 and vancomycin (VCM), and detecting vancomycin-resistant genes (van genes). Susceptibilities of penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (PRSP) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) were also studied. As a result, 2 isolates of E. faecium were found to be moderately resistant to VCM showing MIC of 8 micrograms/ml though the final identification in species level and the detection of van genes by PCR method have not been completed. On the other hand there detected no MRSA nor PRSP showing moderately resistant or resistant to VCM. It was concluded that RP59500 and VCM possessed favorable activity against clinically isolated E. faecium, PRSP and MRSA. Among other species of enterococci, moderately resistant strains to VCM showing MIC of 8 micrograms/ml were detected; 10 isolates of E. gallinarum, 4 of E. casseliflavus and 2 of E. flavescens. In those isolates, vanC1 and vanC2 were detected by PCR, and vanB was also detected in a isolates of E. gallinarum simultaneously.
