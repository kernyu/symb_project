The antistaphylococcal activities of four newly developed antibiotics, moxifloxacin (an 8-methoxyfluoroquinolone), trovafloxacin (a naphthyridone), quinupristin/dalfopristin (a semisynthetic streptogramin) and linezolid (an oxazolidinone), were examined and compared with those of ciprofloxacin, vancomycin and teicoplanin, using an agar dilution method. A total of 245 clinical isolates of staphylococci, including a large number of clonally different methicillin-resistant strains, were tested. The new agents tested exhibited wide-spectrum antistaphylococcal activity against both methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant strains. In contrast to the quinolones, the in-vitro activities of quinupristin/dalfopristin, linezolid and the glycopeptides remained almost unchanged, irrespective of the resistance phenotype for methicillin. A number of isolates with elevated quinolone MICs were observed.
