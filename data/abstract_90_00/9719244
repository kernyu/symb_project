We report a case of steroid-refractory ulcerative colitis, treated with cyclosporine, in a 38-year-old woman with a 13-year history of ulcerative colitis. No remission was achieved with treatments that included intravenous hyperalimentation, sulfasalazine, and intensive parenteral prednisolone therapy for 4 weeks. Intravenous infusion of cyclosporine was performed because the patient refused to undergo surgery. Her condition improved dramatically and colectomy was avoided. She has been maintained on oral cyclosporine and azathioprine since steroids were discontinued, and she has remained in clinical and endoscopic remission for 2 years. The side effects were not significant, but mild paresthesia in both hands and mild hypertension, which was controlled by anti-hypertensives. Cyclosporine seems to be an effective treatment for patients with steroid-refractory severe active ulcerative colitis in whom colectomy seems inevitable. We believe further clinical trials of the treatment are warranted.
