To survey the types of suspect infections, the antibiotic utilization and the patterns of antibiotic resistance among bacterial pathogens in a community Skilled Nursing Facility (SNF), we conducted a 20-month prospective observational surveillance program comprising all 585 patients admitted to a 149-bed private community SNF. Data were collected form medical charts, laboratory reports and nurses reports. Overall, 41% of the patients developed at least one presumptive nosocomial infection, and 54% of the patients received one or more antibiotic treatments. The overall presumptive nosocomial infection rate was 7.2 per 1000 patient days. The most common sites of presumptive nosocomial infection were the urinary tract (38%) and the respiratory tract (28%). The most common pathogens overall were E. coli (25%). Antibiotic groups used most frequently were the quinolones (22% of prescriptions). Thirty-nine percent of the Staphylococcus aureus isolates associated with suspected infections were resistant to methicillin, and of these 94% were also resistant to ciprofloxacin. Most of the resistant S. aureus isolates were from indwelling catheter-associated with UTIs. Infections associated with quinolone resistant strains of gram-negative bacilli were infrequent. No epidemiologic evidence of nosocomial clustering was apparent.
