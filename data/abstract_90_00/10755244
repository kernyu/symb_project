A total of 199 clinical strains of Yersinia enterocolitica serotype O3, biotype 4 were tested for their susceptibility to antibiotics (158 strains carried the virulence plasmid pYV and 41 strains did not). A total of 114 isolates were tested by a standard disk diffusion method for 21 antibiotics. Almost all strains tested were resistant to ampicillin and cefazolin and susceptible to amoxycillin/clavulanate, cefaclor, cefamandole, cefuroxime, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, aztreonam, imipenem, gentamicin, amikacin, netilmicin, tetracycline, doxycycline, chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin, sulphamethoxazole, trimethoprim, co-trimoxazole and furazolidone. In addition, minimal inhibitory concentrations of 15 antibiotics were determined by the agar dilution method for all 199 strains (158 carrying plasmid pYV and 41 strains that did not). Third-generation cephalosporins such as cefotaxime and ceftriaxone and a fluoroquinolone (ciprofloxacin) were the most active antimicrobial agents tested followed by aztreonam, imipenem, trimethoprim, tetracycline, gentamicin, chloramphenicol, amoxycillin/clavulanate, cefaclor, cefuroxime, amikacin, furazolidone and sulphamethoxazole. The present study demonstrated a high susceptibility of clinical strains of Y. enterocolitica to most of the tested antibiotics. In general there was no significant difference between susceptibility to antibacterial agents of strains with or without plasmid pYV.
