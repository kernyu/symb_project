The effect of the monotherapy with piperacillin/tazobactam (P/T) or tazocin on microflora of the mucous membranes of the nose and pharynx of 33 patients and the contents of the large intestine of 21 patients as well as on the immunological aspects (cellular and humoral factors) of the antiinfectious resistance systems (AIRS) in patients with abdominal cavity infection (ACI) was studied. Before the treatment serious impairment of the AIRS in all the patients was observed. The P/T monotherapy in a daily dose of 12/1.5 g at the average for 10 days had no unfavourable effect on the indices characterizing the phagocytic function of the neutrophils in the incompleted and completed variants, on the immunocompetent cells, hemolytic complement and the levels of IgM, IgG and IgA. No significant effect of the treatment on the mucosal microflora on the whole was detected. However, Neisseria spp. and Corynebacterium pseudodiphtheriticum were eradicated in the pharynx while the number of the Klebsiella pneumoniae [symbol: see text] Escherichia coli isolates from the pharynx mucosa increased. The number of the bifidobacteria in the contents of the large intestine significantly lowered while the number of the hemolyzing forms of enterococci and stapylococci increased. The investigation of the AIRS immunological aspects in the patient groups of different total (clinicomorphological) efficacy showed that the neutrophil phagocytic function was the efficacy predictor and P/T in its turn had an immunomodulating effect on the neutrophil phagocytic activity in the patients with ACI.
