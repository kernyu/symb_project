Immunity was induced in albino mice using Chloroquine-attenuated Plasmodium yoelii nigeriensis which had been maintained under drug pressure in 4 passages. Attempts were made to adoptively transfer immunity from the immune to immunologically naive mice by means of serum, spleen and thoracic duct extracts. None of them conferred complete immunity on the recipients but some protection was gained. This was evident from the prolongation of both the pre-patent periods of the infection and the survival periods of the host mice. The best protection conferred by the different extracts was seen in groups that received 0.4 ml serum, 0.9 ml spleen and 1.2 ml thoracic duct extracts whose survival periods lasted 23, 21 and 15 days respectively as compared to 9 days for the controls.
