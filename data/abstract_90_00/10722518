Eleven clonally related Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates were examined. These had been isolated at an intensive care unit in Amsterdam in 1994. Their resistance was associated with a conjugative 170-kb plasmid which encoded a novel SHV beta-lactamase designated SHV-13. The SHV-13 enzyme had two substitutions compared with SHV-1: Leu35Gln and Gly238Ala. It hydrolyzed cefotaxime much more rapidly than ceftazidime or aztreonam.
