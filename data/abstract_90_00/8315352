Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), a lymphokine produced by lymphocytes with the help of monocytes, is essential for host resistance to intracellular pathogens. Leukocytes from normal term newborn infants cannot produce IFN-gamma in vitro in response to stimulation by antigen or mitogens in vitro or in vivo. We investigated the production of IFN-gamma in vitro using endotoxin from Salmonella typhimurium as a stimulus. In contrast to those from adults, mononuclear cells derived from the cord blood of newborn infants did not produce IFN-gamma in response to this endotoxin. We investigated the contribution of the functional immaturity of cord blood monocytes to this relative inability to produce IFN-gamma. Aging of the monocytes for 2 weeks in vitro or treatment of freshly isolated cord blood monocytes with conditioned medium (from cultures of mononuclear cells from healthy adults) greatly enhanced IFN-gamma production stimulated by endotoxin. Furthermore, recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), or IFN-gamma was able to substitute in part for the conditioned medium from adult cells. Thus correction of the functional immaturity of monocytes derived from newborn infants can result in enhanced production of IFN-gamma in vitro.
