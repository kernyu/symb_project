In 11 patients with diffuse peritonitis and 39 patients with general peritonitis the microflora of peritoneal exudate and the sensitivity of isolated microorganisms to antimicrobial preparations were studied. The study revealed that in the total number of microorganisms isolated from peritoneal exudate enterobacteria prevailed in patients with diffuse peritonitis and bacteroids, in patients with general peritonitis. Enterobacteria were most sensitive to ciprofloxacin and claforan, while bacteroids, to ciprofloxacin; at the same time 15.4% of the bacteroid strains under study were resistant to ciprofloxacin.
