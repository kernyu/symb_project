We examined the antimicrobial resistance of 1,257 isolates of 30 serovars of Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica isolated from swine. Serovars Typhimurium and Typhimurium var. Copenhagen were widespread and were frequently multidrug resistant, with distinct resistance to ampicillin, kanamycin, streptomycin, sulfamethoxazole, and tetracycline and to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, streptomycin, sulfamethoxazole, and tetracycline, respectively.
