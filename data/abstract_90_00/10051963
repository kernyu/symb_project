The recent increase in the incidence of infections due to Streptococcus pneumoniae resistant to penicillin and other antibiotics, often associated with considerable morbidity and mortality, has been recognized as an alarming problem. From the recent medical literature data it emerges that among beta-lactam antibiotics used as an empiric treatment for infections caused by S. pneumoniae, amoxycillin and amoxycillin/clavulanic acid are the most active oral antibiotics and may be considered as a first-line therapeutic agent for the treatment of these infections. Since the therapeutic result of the treatment of an infection is determined by the combined effect of the antimicrobials and host defenses, we investigated the effect of amoxycillin, with and without clavulanic acid, upon the in vitro interaction between human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) and a penicillin-resistant strain of S. pneumoniae. Amoxycillin significantly inhibited the streptococcal uptake by PMNs referred to the control system. Clavulanic acid did not have any significant effect upon the interaction PMNs-S. pneumoniae. The addition of amoxycillin/clavulanic acid to phagocytes and streptococci resulted in a synergystic potentiation of the activity of both drugs upon the PMN functions towards S. pneumoniae in such a manner that the bacteria became more susceptible to either the phagocytosis or the microbicidal activities of phagocytes. These effects came in addition to the intrinsic, excellent antimicrobial properties of this drug combination. Although the clinical significance of the observed enhanced effects of amoxycillin/clavulanate are far from elucidated, the possibility exists that they may play a contributory role, especially in patients with impaired host defense.
