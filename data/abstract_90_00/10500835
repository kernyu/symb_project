Drug resistant cells often have an increased capacity to repair their DNA after damage by cytotoxic agents. Aphidicolin can inhibit this DNA repair. We describe a study of the effect of aphidicolin to modulate the sensitivity to cytotoxic drugs of blast cells from 13 patients with AML, 11 with de novo disease on presentation and 2 secondary to MDS. Three patients had relapsed following previous therapy and samples were received from 1 patient both on presentation and relapse. Blast cells were exposed to anthracyclines, antimetabolites or etoposide +/- aphidicolin (15 microM) for 48 hours. The MTT assay was used to measure cell survival and the LC50 (concentration of drug required for 50% cell kill) was calculated. Overall, there was a significant increase in sensitivity to ara-C on co-incubation with aphidicolin in 12/14 samples (p = 0.007). The median increase in sensitivity was 3.88-fold (range 1.26- to 80-fold). Interestingly, when patients were grouped according to in vitro sensitivity to ara-C, cells from resistant patients demonstrated the greatest increase in sensitivity (median 14-fold compared to 2-fold for the sensitive group, p = 0.02). Despite the documented evidence for altered DNA repair as a mechanism of resistance to the topoisomerase II inhibitors, we found no significant increase in sensitivity to daunorubicin, doxorubicin or etoposide on co-incubation with aphidicolin. Nevertheless, we believe the unparalleled modulation of ara-C warrants further investigation.
