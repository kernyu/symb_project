An in vitro investigation was done on antimicrobial activities of cefodizime (CDZM) in combination with gentamicin (GM) against clinically isolated Gram-negative rods. The results are summarized as follows. 1. Combined antimicrobial activities were dependent on antimicrobial activities of GM, similar to the CDZM + sisomicin (SISO) combination. The combined activities were concentration dependent, and they were more strongly dependent on GM concentrations than on CDZM concentrations. The obtained results suggested that synergistic or cooperative antimicrobial activities of the combination would be expected when GM concentrations in blood are at or somewhat lower than 1 MIC, and clinical activities would be exerted regardless of the presence of CDZM resistant organisms, similarly to CDZM+SISO combination. 2. It seems possible that, with regard to combinations of beta-lactam antibiotics and aminoglycoside antibiotics, there exist universal rules that combined activities are dependent on activities of aminoglycoside antibiotics, and that stronger concentration dependencies on aminoglycosides would be observed than those on beta-lactams.
