Thorough counseling with emphasis on the importance of mosquito bite avoidance, as well as on compliance with prophylactic antimalarial regimens, remains an important task for the physician preparing a patient for international travel. Chloroquine continues to be the drug of choice for prophylaxis in areas not reporting chloroquine resistance. Otherwise, mefloquine is the first-line agent. Under special circumstances, alternatives to mefloquine can be employed and include doxycycline or proguanil plus chloroquine.
