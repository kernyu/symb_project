Polypeptide hormones, recognized for their ability to regulate cell growth and differentiation, have been classified as growth factors. These growth factors have been extensively described in higher eukaryotic organisms and cell lines [Hedin and Westermark, Cell 37:9-20, 1984]. Here we report the identification and partial characterization of a putative growth factor present in vegetative amoebae of the cellular slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum. A mutant was selected and found to be temperature sensitive due to the absence of an extracellular protein suggestive of a growth factor. The putative growth factor (DGF) is a protein resistant to both heat and strong detergent treatment but sensitive to reducing agents. The physiological significance of DGF is as yet unknown. DGF is of interest both in relation to understanding the events which control cell proliferation in Dictyostelium and in its relationship to other known growth factors.
