New prodrugs consisting of a beta-D-glucuronic acid linked to a MDR reversal agent (verapamil, quinine or dipyridamole) through a self-immolative spacer were synthesized. Four of them were selected for their reduced cytoxicity and beta-glucuronidase enzymatic efficient hydrolysis. Combined use of these prodrugs with a beta-D-glucuronyl-spacer-doxorubicin (HMR1826) according to an ADEPT strategy restored in vitro the sensibility of a MDR resistant strain.
