The in vitro activity of sparfloxacin was compared with the activities of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, and six other antimicrobial agents against 323 bloodstream isolates of staphylococci (both oxacillin susceptible and resistant) enterococci, and pneumococci. Sparfloxacin was more active than both ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin against all the isolates tested. Its activity (MIC for 90% of strains tested < or = 0.10 microgram/ml) against oxacillin-susceptible staphylococci was superior to that of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin by at least fourfold. Sparfloxacin was also more potent against pneumococci. However, fluoroquinolone resistance was noted among oxacillin-resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci.
