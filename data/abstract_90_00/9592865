We report a local experience with minocycline (100 mg b.i.d.) in treating Chinese patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who were resistant to the conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) treatment. In contrast to a preliminary observation in seven patients with rheumatoid arthritis, minocycline was effective and safe in treating our patients when added to the previous, relatively ineffective DMARD regimen. The antirheumatic effect of minocycline was impressive early in the first month. Drug compliance was fair; all patients continued to receive the study drugs, with no obvious adverse drug reactions. The reason why minocycline showed dramatic effects in reducing disease activity remains to be determined; however, minocycline-associated immune modulation, as indicated in this study, may be one of the important mechanisms in its antiarthritic effects.
