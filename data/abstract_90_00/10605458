NEGLECTED PREVENTIVE MEASURES: Well-proven and simple techniques including isolation of identified germ carriers and hand washing are effective means of preventing acquisition of infections in health care units. The problem is the lack of routine application. LIMITING BACTERIAL RESISTANCE: The negative ecological impact of antibiotic therapy can be counterbalanced by limiting dose and duration of treatments and by using well-adapted taking into account the antibiotic spectrum. PROPOSED STRATEGIES: In order to prevent and better control infections, measures for screening, isolation and identification of infected patients as well as measures to reduce unnecessary or poorly-adapted prescriptions are required to limit major changes in individual and collective bacterial ecology. Interesting strategies proposed for improving management of hospital infections include good clinical practice guidelines and prescription recommendations for specific sites of infection and germs, and interdisciplinary work groups involving bacteriologists, pharmacists, hygiene specialists, epidemiologists and health economists.
