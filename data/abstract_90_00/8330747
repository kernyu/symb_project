The Enterobacteriaceae are the major cause of urinary tract infections (UTI). The Gram-positive Cocci also produce UTI, of these Staphylococcus saprophyticus are the most frequent reported. To know the clinical and microbiological characteristics of the UTI caused by Staphylococcus in the gyneco-obstetric patients, we made a prospective study of the case identified at the Instituto Nacional de Perinatologia during the period from January to July 1992. There were 32 cases, 19 cystourethritis, 12 asymptomatic bacteriuria, and one pyelonephritis. Twenty nine of the Staphylococcus isolated were coagulase-negative (SCN), of them Staphylococcus epidermidis was the most regained. The 82.7% of the SCN isolated had a positive slime test. The antimicrobial susceptibility tests showed a low percent of resistance to the majority of the antimicrobial agents proved excepting penicillin and gentamicin.
