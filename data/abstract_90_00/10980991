For the past decade, the use of oral and intravenous cyclosporine has been examined for patients with inflammatory bowel disease who have demonstrated resistance to steroid treatment. Updated and new results from a number of studies offer short-term and long-term data on cyclosporine and its effectiveness in achieving and maintaining remission from disease. Short-term and long-term toxicity associated with cyclosporine is reviewed here, as well as quality of life among patients who have been treated successfully. Also discussed are practice patterns among clinicians using cyclosporine in its varied formulations and the appropriate settings for its use.
