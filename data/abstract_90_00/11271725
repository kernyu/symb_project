Drug resistant tuberculosis is a serious problem in control of tuberculosis. To assess this problem in Jodhpur district, Sputum samples of symptomatic quarry workers and cases of pulmonary tuberculosis attending District Tuberculosis Clinic (DTC) Jodhpur were tested for culture of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTB) and their sensitivity to antituberculous drugs, using proportion method. Primary drug resistance to isoniazid was observed in 16.67%, to streptomycin in 16.67%, to ethambutol in 6.67% and to rifampicin in 6.67%. Acquired resistance to isoniazid was 61.76%, to streptomycin was 51.52%, to rifampicin was also 70.59%, and to ethambutol was 39.39%. Proportion of Multi-drug resistant (MDR) TB defined as resistant to at least isoniazid and and rifampicin, was 3.3% in new cases (primary drug resistance) and 38.2% in old cases (acquired drug resistance), the later may be due to inadequate treatment, the the history of which was present in most cases. Adequate treatment of such cases with effective regimens is of vital importance to prevent the spread of MDR TB.
