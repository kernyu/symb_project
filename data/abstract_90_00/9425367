Of the 63 Shigella strains isolated from stool cultures from 200 patients who attended a district hospital in Bangladesh with bloody diarrhoea, 37 (59%) were S. dysenteriae type 1, 25 (39%) were S. flexneri and only one (2%) was S. sonnei. Over half (54%) of the Shigella isolates came from children aged < 10 years. Most (89%) of the isolates of S. dysenteriae type 1 were resistant to ampicillin, cotrimoxazole, nalidixic acid, tetracycline and chloramphenicol. Although many (60%) of the isolates of S. flexneri were resistant to ampicillin and cotrimoxazole, only 4% of them were resistant to nalidixic acid. However, all of the S. dysenteriae and S. flexneri were sensitive to ciprofloxacin. The need for periodic monitoring to determine the resistance pattern in remote areas is emphasised.
