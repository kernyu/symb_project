We evaluated the in-vitro effects of various combinations of five types of widely used antipseudomonal antibiotics (piperacillin, meropenem, ceftazidime, aztreonam and amikacin) against six Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains that were resistant to each of these antibiotics. Among two-drug combinations, the combinations of two beta-lactam antibiotics inhibited growth of one to three P. aeruginosa strains, while those of one beta-lactam antibiotic and amikacin inhibited growth of two to four strains. Among three-drug combinations, the combinations of three beta-lactam antibiotics inhibited growth of four to five strains, and those of two beta-lactam antibiotics and amikacin inhibited growth of five strains. These results suggest the potential usefulness of a combination of two beta-lactam antibiotics and amikacin or that of three beta-lactam antibiotics in treating multi-drug resistant P. aeruginosa infections.
