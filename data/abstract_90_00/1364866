Malaria is endemic in all 17 provinces of Laos. Transmission is perennial with a "seasonal peak" coinciding with the rainy season. The vectors Anopheles minimus and An. balabacensis (=dirus) remain susceptible to DDT. Chloroquine-resistance of Plasmodium falciparum is at the RI-RII level. Multidrug resistance is not yet a problem. Major constraints of the antimalaria program involve logistics and operational problems solutions to which are specifically addressed in the recommendations.
