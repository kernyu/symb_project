We report a failure of pristinamycin treatment in a case of pneumonia caused by streptogramins B-type resistant pneumococcus. We suggest that (i) streptogramins therapy should be avoided, if a previous treatment failure has been observed with a macrolide and/or if the antibiogram shows the MLS(B) co-resistance phenotype, and (ii) beta-lactams should remain the first-line antibiotics used for treatment of pneumococcal respiratory infections.
