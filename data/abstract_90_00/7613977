PURPOSE: To determine risk factors for postoperative toxic shock syndrome (PTSS), a rare, rapidly progressive, and potentially fatal syndrome associated with postoperative wound infections. Components of PTSS include fever, rash, desquamation, hypotension, and multisystem organ dysfunction. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of all cases of PTSS occurring in 2 community hospitals from 1981 to 1993, following 390,000 surgical procedures. RESULTS: There were 12 cases of PTSS among the procedures reviewed (0.003%). Orthopedic procedures included excision of accessory navicular and patellar realignment. Wounds ranged from those with scant superficial exudates to those with gross purulence; all cultures yielded Staphylococcus aureus. All tested isolates were susceptible to methicillin or cephalothin. Mean time from surgery to onset of symptoms was 4 days. All patients had sudden onset of fever; mean maximal temperature was 40 degrees C. All patients displayed a rash, most in a truncal "sunburn" pattern. Eleven of 12 patients desquamated. All patients required vigorous fluid resuscitation. All patients survived. No correlation could be demonstrated between PTSS and patient age, sex, preoperative skin preparation or antibiotics, members of surgical team, or duration of procedure. CONCLUSIONS: Early recognition and treatment of PTSS are essential. No risk factors for PTSS have been identified. PTSS should be considered in the postoperative, acutely febrile, systemically ill patient, though surgical wounds may be deceptively benign in appearance.
