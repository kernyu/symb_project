The three chromanone derivatives, (+)-, (-)-, and (+/-)-12-oxocalanolide A (2), were evaluated for in vitro antiviral activities against HIV and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV). The compounds were determined to be inhibitors of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) and exhibited activity against a variety of viruses selected for resistance to other HIV-1 nonnucleoside RT inhibitors. They are the first reported calanolide analogues capable of inhibiting SIV.
