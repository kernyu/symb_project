The failure of three consecutive treatment protocols to significantly increase the complete remission rate for poor prognosis newly diagnosed patients with acute myelocytic leukemia led to a detailed investigation of the causes of treatment failure. In the majority of cases treatment failure was attributable to "clinical resistance" to therapy. Upon close examination two types of "clinical resistance" were discernible: the failure of chemotherapy to produce adequate cytotoxic effects ("classical" drug resistance), and treatment failure attributed to the rapid regrowth of leukemia cells subsequent to the substantial killing of leukemia cells by cytotoxic therapy ("biological" resistance). Each form of resistance accounted for one-half of the treatment failures.
