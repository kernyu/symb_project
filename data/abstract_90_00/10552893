Levels of four antifungal proteins (AFPs) were determined in mature caryopses (40-45 days after anthesis) of eight grain mold resistant (GMR) and eight susceptible (GMS) sorghum lines using the immunoblot technique. These 16 lines came from the same cross and were selected for high and low grain mold resistance. The 16 lines were grown in eight environments over three years. In the environments with grain mold incidence, levels of sormatin, chitinases, and ribosomal inactivating proteins (RIP) in the GMR group were higher than those in the GMS group. In a grain mold-free environment, the GMR group had higher RIP and lower beta-1,3-glucanase levels than the GMS group. Unlike the GMS group, chitinase, sormatin, and RIP levels in the GMR group were higher in the environments with grain mold than in the mold-free environment. AFPs correlated among themselves and with grain mold resistance. Grain mold infection pressure caused GMR lines to induce and/or retain more AFPs compared to GMS lines. The coexpression of these four AFPs may be a necessary prerequisite for resistance to grain mold in sorghums without a pigmented testa.
