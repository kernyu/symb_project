The reverse transcriptase (RT) of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is the major target for antiretroviral therapy of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). While some inhibitors exhibit activity against most retroviral RTs, others are specific for the HIV-1 enzyme. To develop an animal model for the therapy of the HIV-1 infection with RT inhibitors, the RT of the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) was replaced by the RT of HIV-1. Macaques infected with this SIV/HIV-1 hybrid virus developed AIDS-like symptoms and pathology. The HIV-1-specific RT inhibitor LY300046.HCl, but not zidovudine [3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (AZT)] delayed the appearance of plasma antigenemia in macaques infected with a high dose of the chimeric virus. Infection of macaques with the chimeric virus seems to be a valuable model to study the in vivo efficacy of new RT inhibitors, the emergence and reversal of drug resistance, the therapy of infections with drug-resistant viruses, and the efficacy of combination therapy.
