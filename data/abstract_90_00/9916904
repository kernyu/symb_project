We tested 1503 clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, from 48 Canadian medical centers, against ciprofloxacin and 11 other antimicrobial agents to determine in vitro activity. The frequency of susceptibility was highest for carbenicillin and ticarcillin (91% each) followed by imipenem and ceftazadime (90% each). Overall susceptibility (< or = 1.0 mg/l) to ciprofloxacin was 84% while resistance (> or = 4.0 mg/l) was 12%. Ciprofloxacin resistant isolates were more common from urinary tract specimens than from specimens collected from the respiratory and/or skin and soft tissue. Isolates from cystic fibrosis patients were more resistant to all agents tested than isolates from non-cystic fibrosis patients.
