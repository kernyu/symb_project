Voriconazole (UK-109,496) is a new triazole with in vitro activity against a wide spectrum of fungi including yeasts intrinsically resistant to fluconazole such as Candida krusei. In this study the efficacy of voriconazole was compared to amphotericin B and fluconazole in a neutropenic guinea pig model of hematogenously disseminated C. krusei infection. In guinea pigs, neutropenia was established by using cyclophosphamide (intraperitoneally, i.p., 100 mg/kg on day 1 and 4), and dexamethasone (orally, 2 mg/kg/day, for 8 days). Neutropenic guinea pigs were infected with 0.5 ml of yeast cell suspension (1 x 10(8) CFU) intravenously. Challenged animals were treated with antifungals starting 1 h postinfection for 7 days. The animals were divided into five groups: untreated control, amphotericin B (1 mg/kg i.p. on alternate days), fluconazole (20 mg/kg orally twice daily), and voriconazole (two groups: 5 and 10 mg/kg orally twice daily) groups. Guinea pigs were sacrificed 1 day after the last treatment. Brain, liver, and kidneys were removed and weighed, tissues were homogenized and fungal burden determined by serial quantitative counts. Voriconazole at dosages of 5 or 10 mg/kg b.i.d. was shown to be significantly more efficacious than either amphotericin B or fluconazole in eradicating C. krusei from brain, liver and kidney tissue. These data indicate that voriconazole could be efficacious for the treatment of infections caused by fluconazole-resistant Candida, such as C. krusei.
