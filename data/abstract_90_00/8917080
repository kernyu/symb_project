A gene conferring resistance to fosmidomycin (Fs) was cloned from the gene pool of a wild-type strain of Escherichia coli. The cloned DNA fragment was sequenced and shown to encode a putative polypeptide of 406 amino acids (aa) with a molecular weight of 43303. The gene mapped at 10.9 min on the E. coli chromosome and was designated fsr (fosmidomycin resistance). Maxicell analysis revealed that the Fsr protein migrated in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis as a broad band of 35 kDa. A comparison between the aa sequence of Fsr and sequences in a protein database revealed 18% homology to the bacterial drug-export proteins that mediate resistance to tetracycline and chloramphenicol. Hydropathy analysis of the Fsr protein revealed twelve putative transmembrane segments. The degree of FsR of transformants depended on the number of copies of the plasmid that contained fsr. The levels of ubiquinone-8 and undecaprenyl phosphate in cells that harbored a high-copy-number plasmid that included fsr were almost the same as those in the cells without the plasmid. These results suggest that Fsr does not have any direct effect on the biosynthesis of isoprenoid in E. coli, and that the mechanism for FsR involves the efflux of the drug by a process that is facilitated by Fsr.
