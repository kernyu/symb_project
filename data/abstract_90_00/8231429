Susceptibility to norfloxacin, ofloxacin, pipemidic acid and nalidixic acid of 848 bacterial strains isolated from urine of patients treated in 1989-1992 in Wroclaw hospitals was investigated. The study, performed by the disc diffusion methods, concerned 568 Enterobacteriaceae strains, 147 Gram-negative non-fermenting bacteria and 133 strains of staphylococci. Highest percentage (90-100%) of susceptibility to all used antimicrobial agents was detected among Escherichia, Proteus, Morganella and Citrobacter. Less frequent susceptibility (30-70%) was observed among Klebsiella, Enterobacter and Serratia. Among strains of P. aeruginosa susceptible to norfloxacin and ofloxacin were, respectively, 61.4 and 22.2% isolates. Over 95% of strains of P. aeruginosa were resistant to nalidixic acid. Among other non-fermenting Gram-negative bacteria, over 50% were resistant to norfloxacin and ofloxacin. Both S. aureus and S. epidermidis were susceptible to ofloxacin and norfloxacin in 81-93% of tested strains. They were 2-3 times less frequently susceptible to pipemidic and nalidixic acid.
