Aspergillus terreus was transformed to hygromycin B resistance using a bacterial resistance gene under the control of Aspergillus nidulans regulatory sequences. Southern hybridization of transformants indicated that in most of the cases the vector DNA was integrated into the recipient chromosome in the form of tandem arrays. Transformants were mitotically stable in both selective and non-selective medium and retained their capacity to produce xylanase or glucoamylase activities.
