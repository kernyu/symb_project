A randomized prospective study comparing pefloxacin to teicoplanin in the treatment of gram-positive infections in cancer patients was prematurely terminated because of the emergence of pefloxacin resistance associated with oxacillin resistance in Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci. Among 56 patients evaluated for efficacy (26 pefloxacin and 30 teicoplanin) and infected with bacteria susceptible to both antibiotics, the clinical cure and eradication rates were similar for pefloxacin (80.5% and 77.3% respectively) and teicoplanin (66.6% and 52.2% respectively). The relapse rates (15% and 10% for pefloxacin and teicoplanin respectively) and the overall mortalities within 1 month (42% and 31%) were similar.
