Injections of HgCl2 lead to autoimmune manifestations in genetically predisposed rats and mice. In this study, the authors examined the responsiveness of T subsets from different mouse strains to HgCl2 by tracing their expression of the very early activation antigen CD69. The authors found increased expression of the CD69 antigen on CD4+ T cells from the responder A.SW and BALB/c mice, but not on CD4+ T cells from the non-responder DBA/2 mice, indicating an activation of T helper cells in the responder strains. However, the CD69 antigen was induced on CD8+ T cells from all strains irrespective whether they were susceptible or resistant to mercury-induced autoimmunity. Since CD8+ T cells have been described as mediating immunosuppression and as being responsible for the resistance to autoimmune induction by mercury, the authors tested whether CD8+ T cells inhibited the activation of CD4+ T cells by HgCl2 in the non-responder strains. However, there was no evidence for a suppressive role of CD8+ T cells from the DBA/2 mice in the response to HgCl2. The findings indicate that T helper cells play a central role in the immunological effects of HgCl2 and unresponsiveness of T helper cells in the nonresponder strains is not due to CD8(+)-mediated immunosuppression.
