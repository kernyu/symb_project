A controlled clinic assay was realized with 217 students of Marracuene, Maputo province in Mozambique. They were positives to Schistosoma haematobium parasite and 204 of them were positives helmints too. We created two groups for study. Group I received Mebendazole as treatment and Group II received Mebendazole and Inoxuprin that is considered as immunomodulator. They were rechecked one and six month after received treatment and we comproved that any people in Group II resulted positive after six month of treatment. We can be suppose that inoxuprin act to increasing the FC expression spot in mastocytes, eosinophils and B leukocytes and produce an augment in the number of specific IgE. In other hand when the parasites number is reduced or eliminated by Mebendazole, is reduced too the neuropeptides concentration and diminish the blocked of IFN gamma excretion, in this form we can to explain the infection resistance in the ages that are reported.
