Multiple drug resistance in Plasmodium falciparum is already showing evidence of extending to mefloquine, which at present is one of the few alternative antimalarials for the prevention or treatment of infection with such parasites. Neither verapamil nor cyproheptadine, which reverse chloroquine (CQ) resistance in P. falciparum and in rodent malaria parasites, reverse resistance to mefloquine (MEF) in the MEF-resistant NS/1100 line of P. yoelii ssp. NS. On the other hand, such resistance is clearly reversed when mefloquine is administered to infected mice together with penfluridol.
