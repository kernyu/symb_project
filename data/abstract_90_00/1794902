During a two year period, a total of 15 strains of S. typhimurium were isolated and analysed by phage typing. Of these, 13 were found untypable, while two strains belonged to phage 76 and 22. All the strains were sensitive to Gentamicin and Cephaloridine. All but one showed multiple drug resistance.
