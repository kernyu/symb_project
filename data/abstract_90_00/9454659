OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to study the effectiveness of cyclosporin A and cisplatin in patients with recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer. METHODS. Twenty-six patients with measurable recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer, considered to be resistant to cisplatin, received cisplatin in combination with cyclosporin A. Patients received 75 mg/m2 cisplatin every 3 weeks and two cyclosporin A injections over 2 h each, 24 h apart, at a dose of 4 mg/kg each. RESULTS: Only a single patient had a complete response, with two experiencing a partial response to cyclosporin A/cisplatin combination. Hematologic toxicity in this study was modest. No patient developed grade 4 renal toxicity. CONCLUSION: These data indicate minimal activity of the combination of cyclosporin A and cisplatin in ovarian cancer patients with recurrent measurable disease previously treated with cisplatin and thought to be resistant to this chemotherapeutic agent.
