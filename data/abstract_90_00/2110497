Between October 1987 and June 1989, 84 isolates of Neisseria gonorrhoeae carrying the TetM resistance determinant (TRNG) were received at the Laboratory Centre for Disease Control, Ottawa, from six Canadian provinces and were characterized into classes based on auxotype, serovar and plasmid content. One-fifth (17/84) of the TRNG were also penicillinase producing (PPNG). The PPNG-TRNG isolates comprised six classes based on auxotype, serovar, and plasmid content. Most (16/17) PPNG-TRNG carried 3.2-MDa beta-lactamase plasmids and the 25.2-MDa TetM-containing plasmid. We report, for the first time, the association of a 4.5-MDa beta-lactamase plasmid with the 25.2-MDa plasmid in a clinical TRNG isolate. Non-PPNG TRNG isolates comprised 11 classes based on auxotype, serovar, and plasmid content, including two previously unreported auxotype-serovar classes, P/IB-26 and P/IB-20.
