A review was made of 58 cases of suspected endophthalmitis presenting to Auckland Public Hospital between January 1983 and July 1991 (103 months). Thirty culture positive cases were found comprising 13 early onset postoperative, six delayed onset postoperative, five bleb-associated, four post-traumatic and two endogenous cases. The most frequent organism grown in postoperative endophthalmitis was Staphylococcus epidermidis. No conclusion could be reached as to the effectiveness of early versus delayed vitrectomy. Endophthalmitis due to S. epidermidis usually had a good prognosis while streptococcal endophthalmitis had a poor prognosis. Delayed-onset postoperative endophthalmitis most often had a good prognosis while bleb-associated endophthalmitis had a uniformly poor visual outcome. Two isolates responsible for cases of delayed-onset postoperative endophthalmitis, Propionibacterium acnes and Rhodococcus species, did not grow on agar plates until the seventh day of culture. Significant bacterial resistance to cephazolin was identified with 33% of Gram-positive and 75% of Gram-negative isolates resistant. Prevention of postoperative endophthalmitis is discussed.
