Some mechanisms of inducing resistance to experimental infection with tick-borne encephalitis virus were studied in experimental mice treated with aqueous extracts of berries of Vaccinium vitis-idaea, black currant, Vaccinium myrtillus, and of greater celandine grass. The condition of the immune system organs (spleen and thymus) after treatment with the extracts under study was analysed. A correlation was found between the degree of developing resistance to infection, virus accumulation in the brain, blood, spleen and thymus and changes in some parameters (spleen and thymus indices) of these immunocompetent organs. Possible mechanisms of induction of resistance to virus by herb extracts are discussed.
