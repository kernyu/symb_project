Escherichia coli serotype O147:K89:K88a,c was found to be associated with outbreaks of diarrhoea in preweaner pigs of up to 4 weeks of age on a pig unit. Resistance to apramycin, gentamicin, netilmicin, tobramycin and other antibiotics was associated with conjugative plasmids of approximately 62 kb. The presence of a gene which encoded for the aminoglycoside acetyltransferase enzyme AAC(3)IV was confirmed by DNA hybridization. Samples collected during the following 12 months revealed widespread dissemination of these resistance plasmids in non-serotypable, non-haemolytic E. coli throughout the farm. Apramycin-resistant E. coli were also isolated from a stockman and it appeared from plasmid profile analysis and antibiotic sensitivity testing that the human isolates carried the same plasmid as that carried by the porcine E. coli. Klebsiella pneumoniae, with a slightly smaller conjugative plasmid and similar resistance pattern, was isolated from the stockman's wife.
