OBJECTIVES: The purpose of the present study was to test the hypothesis that intravenous quinidine, unlike procainamide, causes direct vasodilation and reflexly mediated increases in sympathetic nerve activity. BACKGROUND: Intravenous quinidine can cause significant hypotension. Animal experiments have suggested that quinidine blocks alpha-receptors and also relaxes vascular smooth muscle by a nonadrenergic mechanism. In a recent study we showed that intravenous procainamide causes peripheral vasodilation, hypotension and inhibition of sympathetic nerve activity in humans. Intraarterial procainamide, however, did not cause vasodilation. METHODS: Postganglionic muscle sympathetic nerve traffic was recorded from the peroneal nerve at the fibular head with tungsten microelectrodes, and forearm blood flow was measured with venous occlusion plethysmography. Central venous pressure was measured directly. The direct effects of quinidine on vascular resistance were determined with brachial artery quinidine infusions and measurement of ipsilateral forearm blood flow. RESULTS: In eight normal subjects intravenous quinidine (8 mg/kg body weight infused for 27 min) decreased mean arterial pressure from 87 +/- 3 (mean +/- SE) to 83 +/- 3 mm Hg, central venous pressure from 6.3 +/- 0.6 to 5.0 +/- 0.7 mm Hg and forearm vascular resistance from 32.2 +/- 5.5 to 25.3 +/- 4.7 U (all p < 0.05). Heart rate increased from 67 +/- 4 to 77 +/- 5 beats/min and muscle sympathetic nerve activity from 288 +/- 70 to 660 +/- 151 U/min (both p < 0.05). In five subjects intravenous nitroprusside that caused similar hemodynamic effects produced similar increases in sympathetic nerve activity. In eight subjects graded infusions of quinidine into the brachial artery (0.37, 0.74 and 1.48 mg/min) produced dose-dependent decreases in ipsilateral forearm vascular resistance and marked attenuation of forearm vasoconstriction caused by the cold pressor test. CONCLUSIONS: These data show that quinidine, unlike procainamide, causes vasodilation directly and, when given intravenously, is associated with baroreflex-mediated increases in sympathetic nerve activity.
