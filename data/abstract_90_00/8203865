The in vitro susceptibilities of 130 Xanthomonas maltophilia isolates to 12 antibiotics--trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, minocycline, ticarcillin-clavulanate, ceftazidime, cefoperazone, cefoperazone-sulbactam, imipenem, ciprofloxacin, and the investigational quinolones PD 117558, PD 117596, PD 127391, and sparfloxacin--were determined by a microtiter broth dilution technique. Other than the investigational quinolones, the most active antibiotics were minocycline, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and ticarcillin-clavulanate, in order. However, the first two were not bactericidal, while about half of the isolates exhibited intermediate susceptibility to ticarcillin-clavulanate. Patterns of susceptibility to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and ciprofloxacin relative to the years of isolation of these strains reflected the development of resistance to the antibiotic prophylaxis practices in the hospital. We recommend that a combination of antibiotics, such as trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, minocycline, and ticarcillin-clavulanate, at or close to the maximum tolerated doses be in the treatment of serious X. maltophilia infections.
