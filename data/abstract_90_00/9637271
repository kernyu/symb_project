In the present study, algal isolates recovered during the period 1991 through 1996 from Danish cases of bovine mastitis were characterized and identified. Sixteen isolates of Prototheca were obtained, all of which were identified as Prototheca zopfii according to assimilation pattern, absence of capsules and resistance to clotrimazole.
