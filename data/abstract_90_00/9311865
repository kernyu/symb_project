The prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy of interleukin-12 was studied by using murine models of herpes simplex virus infection. Prophylactic administration consisted of two intraperitoneal doses of interleukin-12 given 48 and 24 h prior to infection. Therapeutic intraperitoneal administration of interleukin-12 commenced 6 h after the mice were infected with herpes simplex virus and was continued daily for a total of 5 days. Interleukin-12 therapy improved the survival rates of mice with systemic herpes simplex virus infection compared with those of placebo-treated infected mice. Subcutaneous administration of interleukin-12 also improved the rate of survival of mice after systemic herpes simplex virus infection, although higher doses were required to give comparable effects. Combined prophylactic and therapeutic administration of interleukin-12 produced the greatest effect on survival after an otherwise lethal systemic infection. Intraperitoneal administration of interleukin-12 for 2 days before and 3 days after systemic infection with herpes simplex virus resulted in survival of 80% of the mice. These surviving mice were resistant to subsequent reinfection with herpes simplex virus. Such resistance was apparently specific for herpes simplex virus infection, since a second group of survivors succumbed to a lethal infection with murine cytomegalovirus. Infectious virus was recovered from lumbar ganglia explants dissected from survivors of prophylactic interleukin-12 therapy and cultured for 5 days in vitro, suggesting that interleukin-12 treatment did not prevent the establishment of latent herpes simplex virus infection. One action of interleukin-12 may be to enhance natural killer cell-mediated clearance of the virus. However, interleukin-12 therapy was also effective in mice carrying the beige mutation, which reduces natural killer cell lytic activity, suggesting that interleukin-12 has additional activities in vivo.
