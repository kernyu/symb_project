Sensitivity of Shigella spp. isolated in one of the hospitals of Nukus within 1987-1988 and earlier in 1977 and 1985 was studied. S. flexneri 1-5 remained the main causative agents of dysentery on the territory. However, beginning from 1987 there were registered cases of dysentery caused by S. dysenteriae 1. The isolates were most sensitive to cefotaxime, cephaloridine, polymyxin B and gentamicin. The majority of the isolates were resistant to tetracycline, levomycetin (chloramphenicol) and streptomycin. No significant changes in the sensitivity levels of the strains isolated in 1987-1988 as compared to those isolated in 1985 were observed.
