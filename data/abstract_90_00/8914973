Two systemic antiviral resistance-inducing proteins, CIP-29 and CIP-34, isolated from Clerodendrum inerme Gaertn. leaves, were tested for ribosome-inactivating properties. It was found that CIP-29 has the characteristics of a polynucleotide:adenosine glycosidase (ribosome-inactivating protein), in that it inhibits protein synthesis both in cell-free systems and, at higher concentrations, in cells, and releases adenine from ribosomes, RNA, poly(A) and DNA. As compared with other known RIPs, CIP-29 deadenylates DNA at a high rate, and induces systemic antiviral resistance in susceptible plants.
