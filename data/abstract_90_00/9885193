Wheat cDNAs that encode proteins PR-1.1 and PR-1.2 were cloned. Deduced amino acid sequences were homologous to those of pathogen-induced, basic PR-1 proteins from plants. Although expression of PR1.1 and PR1.2 genes was induced upon infection with either compatible or incompatible isolates of the fungal pathogen Erysiphe graminis, these genes did not respond to activators of systemic acquired resistance (SAR), such as salicylic acid (SA), benzothiadiazole (BTH), or isonicotinic acid (INA).
