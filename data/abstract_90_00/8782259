BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of topical cyclosporine on the function of filtering blebs and fibroblast proliferation after glaucoma drainage implant surgery in rabbits. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Intraocular pressure, flow resistance through the implant capsule, and fibroblast density in the capsule were compared between 12 eyes that received implant surgery only (group A) and 11 eyes treated with topical 2% cyclosporine twice a day for 2 weeks after implant surgery (group B). RESULTS: There were significantly larger decreases in intraocular pressure at 1,2,4, and 8 weeks postoperatively in group B than in group A (n = 12, P < .05). Flow resistance was significantly lower in group B than in group A (n = 5, P < .05) at 8 weeks postoperatively. Fibroblast density was not significantly different between the two groups (n = 3, P > .05). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that topical 2% cyclosporine may enhance the effectiveness of glaucoma drainage implant surgery.
