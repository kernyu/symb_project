The investigation of susceptibility of Candida species to fluconazole was performed in microdilution to a supplemented HR-medium. The sufficient reproducibility of the test was verified using special control isolates and isolates of patients. The excellent applicability of the method in routine diagnostics was evaluated by in vitro testing of susceptibility of 279 Candida isolates from patients being colonised or suffering from endomycoses. The Candida species showed different susceptibility against fluconazole: 96% of the C. albicans isolates were sensitive, 55% of the C. glabrata isolates had a reduced sensitivity, and 26% were resistant against fluconazole (MIC > 25 micrograms/ml). C. krusei isolates were highly resistant (9 of 11 strains).
