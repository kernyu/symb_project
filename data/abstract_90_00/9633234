The paper briefly reviews a study on the design of drugs enhancing the body's nonspecific resistance to pathogenic agents. To examine the potential regulatory effects on cytokine function was a main trend. The interferon inductor ridostin, dsRNA of microbiological origin, cytokines, as well as the recombinant probiotic strain yielding interferon alpha-2 synthesis were used as a pharmacological agent. This was shown by using a wide range of experimental models wherein these preparations activated the components of the non-specific resistance system resulting in the host's increased capacity to eliminate invasive agents and transformed cells.
