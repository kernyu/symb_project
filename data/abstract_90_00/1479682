Antibacterial effects of combination use of arbekacin (ABK) with cefotiam (CTM) or cefuzonam (CZON) were evaluated against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and the following results were obtained. 1. Antibacterial effects of combinations of ABK with CTM and with CZON were equally potent against MRSA at clinically expected 1 MIC of ABK in blood. However, at a sub MIC of ABK the different effects were observed between the 2 combinations. The antibacterial effect of the former was strong and that of the latter was a little weak. 2. In either combination the potency of the antibacterial activity was less dependent on the concentration of CTM or CZON, but was strongly dependent on ABK concentrations. These results suggest that antibacterial effects of the combinations were highly dependent on antibacterial potency and concentration of ABK as previously reported for combinations of ABK with other drugs. 3. The combination use of ABK with CTM appears to be useful in cases of infection by MRSA alone while the combination use of ABK with CZON appears to be useful in cases of double infection with MRSA and Gram-negative bacterium.
