Unexpected clonal variability was observed in the content of beta-globin mRNA in erythropoietin receptor (EpoR)-transfected Ba/F3 cells before and after exposure to erythropoietin (Epo). Of 11 clones selected by virtue of G418 resistance and positive EpoR expression, 5 clones showed high levels of beta(major)-globin mRNA before Epo exposure, with subsequent Epo treatment causing little or no increase in globin mRNA. Five clones had undetectable levels of globin mRNA before Epo stimulation, and they did not accumulate globin mRNA when exposed to Epo, exhibiting resistance to the differentiation inducing action of Epo. Only one clone exhibited the expected phenotype, a low level of globin mRNA before exposure to Epo, and a significant Epo-dependent accumulation of globin mRNA. Phosphorylation of tyrosyl residues of the EpoR, Stat5, and JAK2 occurred upon Epo stimulation in clones representing each category. Furthermore, electrophoretic mobility shift assays using a Stat5 consensus sequence showed a difference in the nuclear binding component among these clones. These findings indicate that (1) the attainment of EpoR+ Ba/F3 clones with the anticipated sensitivity to both the growth and differentiation inducing actions of Epo is a rare event and (2) STAT5 transcription factors were differently activated by Epo in clones that differed in sensitivity to Epo.
