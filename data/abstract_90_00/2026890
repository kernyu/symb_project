Endocarditis caused by a Corynebacterium sp. resistant to vancomycin, penicillin G, erythromycin, gentamicin and rifampicin arose in a 44-year-old woman 4 months after replacement of the mitral valve with a prosthesis. She was successfully treated with a 79-day course of intravenous imipenem and ciprofloxacin and replacement of the prosthesis 48 days after treatment began.
