This phase II study evaluated the response rate and toxicity of single-agent gemcitabine in 40 women with epithelial ovarian cancer, previously treated with platinum-based chemotherapy. Patients had stage III or IV disease and progressive disease 1-12 months after the last treatment. Gemcitabine 1250 mg/m2 was administered on days 1, 8 and 15 of each 28-day cycle as a 30-minute infusion. The overall response rate to gemcitabine was 22% (95% confidence intervals: 10-39%). Responses to gemcitabine were observed in patients with platinum-refractory disease, which suggests no cross resistance to platinum. Gemcitabine was well tolerated and no grade 4 toxicity was seen. This study confirms that gemcitabine is active and well tolerated in pre-treated women with ovarian cancer.
