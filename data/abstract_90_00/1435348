421 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were isolated from patients admitted to intensive care units and tested with automated systems for sensitivity to 21 antimicrobial agents. Data were collected in a database for evaluation and monitoring of resistance development. Results showed that assisted monitoring of antimicrobial resistance gives continuously updated information, with particular attention to the different local therapeutical schedules. It is therefore advisable that clinicians constantly exchange information with the microbiology laboratory through a hospital information system in which data from different laboratories are pooled in real time.
