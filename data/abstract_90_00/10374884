The prognosis for patients with secondary AML, primary resistant AML or ALL and early (<12 months) relapse of acute leukaemia remains extremely poor with conventional chemotherapy. As part of a strategy to improve the outcome for these patients we have treated 22 consecutive patients (18 AML, four ALL, median age 35 years) with either primary resistant disease (n=3), early relapsed leukaemia (n= 12) or secondary AML (n= 7, four RAEBt, two antecedant ALL and one antecedant Hodgkin's disease) with 'FLAG' induction chemotherapy with the aim of proceeding to early allogeneic transplantation either from sibling or unrelated donors. Eighteen patients achieved CR after one course of FLAG, including five patients who had documented p-glycoprotein-induced multidrug resistance and 10 patients with adverse cytogenetic abnormalities. Eight patients were consolidated with a second course of FLAG prior to transplantation and so far 16 patients have undergone allogeneic transplantation, 10 from unrelated donors and six from sibling donors (one mismatched). By the time of transplant three patients had progressed and were in early relapse and all have relapsed post BMT. Of the remaining 13 patients transplanted in remission, nine remain in CCR at a range of 4-26 months, three have died of transplant-related complications (18%) and one patient has relapsed. We conclude that the use of FLAG induction therapy followed by early allogeneic transplantation from either a sibling or unrelated donor can be an effective strategy for the treatment of this difficult group of young patients with poor risk acute leukaemia and appears to be associated with a low procedure-related risk.
