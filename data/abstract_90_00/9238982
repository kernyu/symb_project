A great deal has been learned over the past 1 to 2 years about treatment of HIV infection. Viral load testing now provides a reliable method of assessing the effectiveness of any treatment regimen. And it is now clear that triple combinations of drugs (typically two nucleoside analogues and one protease inhibitor) are producing excellent reductions in viral load with concomitant elevations in CD4+ counts. This new triple-approach drug regimen has demonstrated clear advantage in delaying disease progression in persons in very early or late stages of the disease.
