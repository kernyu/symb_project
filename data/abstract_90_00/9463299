Binding of exogenous actinomycin D (AMD) by washed mycelium of streptomycetes i.e. variants of Streptomyces chrysomallus producing and not producing actinomycins and Streptomyces lividans not synthesizing the antibiotics was studied. Dependence of the bound quantity of AMD on its concentration, incubation time and temperature, energy source availability, influence of respiration inhibitors and the membranotropic antibiotic gramicidin S was shown. The intracellularly localized portion of the bound AMD likely penetrated to the cells by diffusion and was strongly bound presumably to DNA in the AMD sensitive S.lividans and to the specific intracellular actinomycin-binding proteins in the AMD resistant variants of S.chrysomallus. The ratio of AMD strongly bound by the mycelium and AMD easily washed with physiological solution and probably localized on the surface was determined. The ratio depended on sensitivity of the culture to AMD and for the variants of S.chrysomallus on the age of the culture and its ability to synthesize actinomycins.
