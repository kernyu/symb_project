Genetic transformation of Wangiella dermatitidis was studied using three plasmid vectors (pAN7-1, pWU44, and pKK5) and both electroporation and polyethyleneglycol-mediated methods. pAN7-1 contains the E. coli hygromycin B (HmB) phosphotransferase (hph) gene. Expression of the hph gene confers resistance to antibiotic HmB. Selection for resistance, indicative of transformation, resulted in 10 203 HmB-resistant colonies/micrograms pAN7-1 on medium containing 100 micrograms HmB/ml. Strains of W. dermatitidis used in this study have innate sensitivity to HmB at a critical inhibitory concentration of 20-40 micrograms/ml. Vectors pWU44 and pKK5 contain a URA5 gene from Podospora anserina. A ura5 auxotroph of W. dermatitidis was transformed to prototrophy with pWU44 or pKK5 by complementation. Transformation frequencies for these two plasmids were between 17-50 transformants/micrograms vector DNA. Southern blotting analysis and polymerase chain reaction detection of DNA from putative transformants confirmed transformation.
