We studied the activity of eight fluoroquinolones (norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, grepafloxacin, trovafloxacin, gatifloxacin, clinafloxacin, PD-117596 and PD-138312) against 58 multiresistant Stenotrophomonas maltophilia clinical strains. Norfloxacin was the least active drug (MIC(90) = 128 mg/l). Grepafloxacin, trovafloxacin and gatifloxacin activity was moderately higher (MIC(90) = 8 mg/l) than ciprofloxacin (MIC(90) = 16 mg/l). The best activity was shown by clinafloxacin and PD-138312 (MIC(90) = 4 mg/l). The most resistant strains showed similar MICs against all the fluoroquinolones tested. The highest increase of activity of newer fluoroquinolones was observed against the most sensitive strains.
