The polycationic antibiotic, nourseothricin, represents a mixture of several streptothricins, mainly D and F. The molecular weight of the latter compound amounts to 486. Obviously, although very slowly, it can pass the outer membrane via the porin pores. It has been shown earlier that nourseothricin is able to generate some kind of channels into the outer membrane through which it can pass the cell wall. On the other hand, there were indications that resistant strains containing a streptothricin-inactivating acetyl transferase possess an additional protecting system, namely a reduced penetrability of the outer membrane. In this study, it could be shown that such strains indeed could be rendered sensitive by damaging the barrier function of the outer membrane.
