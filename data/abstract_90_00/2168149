The proportion of DNA gyrase mutants among quinolone-resistant strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was examined by introducing the cloned wild-type Escherichia coli gyrA and gyrB genes. Of 101 spontaneous mutants of P. aeruginosa PAO505, 33 (33%) were found to have gyrA mutations. Among 17 clinical isolates, 12 (71%) had gyrA mutations and 1 (6%) had a gyrB mutation.
