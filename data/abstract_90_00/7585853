Given the prevalence of complicated urinary tract infection (UTI) and the resistance patterns of common uropathogens, antimicrobial therapy for complicated UTI must be carefully selected. For patients with complicated UTI who can be treated with oral medication, the quinolones or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) are reasonable treatment choices. Enoxacin and TMP-SMX were compared for efficacy, safety, and bacteriologic response in this study. A total of 260 patients with complicated UTI were enrolled in a multicenter, open-label, randomized study and received enoxacin or TMP-SMX. Short-term assessments 5 to 9 days posttherapy and long-term assessments 4 to 6 weeks posttherapy included physical and clinical evaluations, laboratory testing, urine cultures, and susceptibility testing. Although enoxacin and TMP-SMX demonstrated comparable short-term efficacy rates, enoxacin exerted a potent, long-term bacteriologic response, particularly against Escherichia coli. Enoxacin therapy achieved a 94.7% long-term eradication rate against E coli compared with a 76.0% eradication rate against this pathogen with TMP-SMX. Most adverse events were mild, and a comparable incidence (approximately 17%) occurred in both treatment groups. These data indicate that enoxacin is an excellent addition to the armamentarium of agents commonly used in the treatment of patients with complicated UTI.
