Activities of clarithromycin, erythromycin, and azithromycin against 120 pneumococci from the United States were tested by agar dilution MIC. All three compounds yielded MICs at which 90% of the isolates were inhibited (MIC90S) of < or = 0.125 micrograms/ml against penicillin-susceptible and -intermediate strains, but MIC90S against resistant strains were > 128.0 micrograms/ml. All erythromycin-resistant strains were also resistant to clarithromycin and azithromycin. Clarithromycin yielded MICs which were generally one or two dilutions lower than those of the other two compounds for all strains. The respective bacteriostatic and bactericidal values (micrograms per milliliter) for two susceptible, two intermediate, and two resistant strains were 0.004 to 0.03 and 0.016 to 0.03 (0.004 to 0.03/0.016 to 0.03) (clarithromycin), 0.008 to 0.06/0.016/0.016 to 0.125 (erythromycin), and 0.016 to 0.06/0.03 to 0.125 (azithromycin); clarithromycin yielded the lowest values. All compounds were uniformly bactericidal after 24 h only; erythromycin was bactericidal at eight times the MIC, and azithromycin and clarithromycin were both bactericidal at two time the MIC. The relevance of these in vitro differences requires clarification by clinical trials.
