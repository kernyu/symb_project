The in-vitro activity of povidone-iodine (PVP-I) and chlorhexidine (CHX) against 33 clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was evaluated by a quantitative suspension test method. Bactericidal potency was measured by the logarithmic reduction factors (LRFs) achieved with each strain, tested at dilutions 25-800 over exposure times 30-300 s using a challenge of approximately 10(7) colony forming units (cfu) ml-1. The mean LRFs achieved over all dilutions, times and strains were significantly higher for PVP-I than CHX. PVP-I exhibited a superior killing effect whether measured by rate of kill or final LRF achieved. This difference was highly significant as judged by analysis of variance (P less than 0.001). Full efficacy of an antiseptic has been defined as a safe LRF greater than five. Over the dilution range 25-200 this was achieved by CHX with only three of 33 strains. In contrast, PVP-I achieved full efficacy with all 33 strains.
