Lipopeptide L-733560 is a hybrid analog of L-731373 and L-705589. All are water-soluble semisynthetic pneumocandin Bo derivatives. In vitro susceptibility testing of L-705589, L-731373, and L-733560 against more than 200 clinical isolates consisting of eight Candida species, Cryptococcus neoformans, and three Aspergillus species was performed by the broth microdilution methods. All three pneumocandins exhibited potent anti-Candida activity and moderate anti-C. neoformans activity. However, anti-Aspergillus activity was demonstrated only by an agar disk diffusion method. Antifungal agent-resistant Candida species and C. neoformans showed susceptibility comparable to that of susceptible isolates. Growth inhibition kinetic studies against Candida albicans revealed fungicidal activity within 3 to 5 h. Drug combination studies with pneumocandins and amphotericin B revealed indifferent activity against C. albicans and additive effects against C. neoformans and Aspergillus fumigatus. The activities of the compounds were not dramatically affected by the presence of serum. Resistance induction studies showed that the susceptibility of C. albicans MY1055 was not significantly altered by repeated exposure to subinhibitory concentrations of L-733560. Erythrocyte hemolysis studies indicated minimal hemolytic potential with pneumocandins. Results from preclinical evaluations and development studies performed thus far indicate that the pneumocandins should be safe, broad-spectrum fungicidal agents and potent parenteral antifungal agents.
