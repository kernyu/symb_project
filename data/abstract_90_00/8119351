Aminoglycoside resistance patterns of 147 Serratia marcescens strains of clinical origin were studied. All strains analysed belonged to three different bacterial populations. The periods of study and the institutions the strains were isolated from correlated significantly with the resistance patterns shown by the strains. The most frequent resistance patterns found were the following: ACC (6')-I at the Hospital Infantil de Mexico (Children's Hospital of Mexico), and ANT (2'') + AAC(6')-I at the Instituto Nacional de Pediatria (INPed or National Institute of Pediatrics) in Mexico City. Furthermore, the isolation frequency of aminoglycoside-sensitive strains decreased remarkably at the INPed over a 12-year period. These results suggest that there has been a selection of Serratia marcescens strains that are very resistant to aminoglycosides.
