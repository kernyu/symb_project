Vancomycin in combination with ciprofloxacin exhibited synergy against 7 of 10 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. MICs for the microbial strains used in this study ranged from 0.0325 to 3.0 micrograms/ml for ciprofloxacin and from 23.5 to > 188 micrograms/ml for vancomycin. Combinations of these antibiotics, tested in a checkerboard pattern, gave fractional inhibitory concentrations of 0.5 or less for 7 of the 10 strains tested.
