The 365 strains of Vibrio cholerae, isolated in Marrakesh from raw sewage and stabilization pond effluent, were all identified as non-O1 Vibrio cholerae. When tested for their susceptibilities to ampicillin, amoxicillin, cephalothin, streptomycin, novobiocin, chloramphenicol, nalidixic acid and trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole, 13% of the strains from raw sewage and 20% of those from stabilization pond effluent were found to be resistant to one or more of the antibiotics. There were no significant differences, in terms of drug resistance, between isolates from the new sewage and those from the ponds' effluent.
