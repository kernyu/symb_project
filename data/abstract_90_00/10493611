BACKGROUND: Metronidazole and clarithromycin-based therapies are among the most efficacious treatment regimens for H. pylori infection. Resistance to metronidazole or clarithromycin is associated with impaired therapy with these agents. We conducted a retrospective review of susceptibility data to determine the frequency of primary metronidazole and clarithromycin resistance among H. pylori isolates from a single metropolitan hospital in the United States. The database comprised 933 patients who presented at the Digestive Diseases Clinic at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Houston between September 1988 and January 1997 with complaints of dyspepsia, abdominal pain and peptic ulcer disease. One hundred and seventy-nine of these patients had both pharmaceutical records available for evaluation and culture and antimicrobial susceptibility data for analysis. The MICs were determined by both E-test and broth microdilution tests. The frequency of primary metronidazole resistance was 37.4% (67/179). The level of primary clarithromycin resistance was 6.1%. Dual metronidazole and clarithromycin resistance was present in approx. 3%. The high level of primary metronidazole and clarithromycin resistance in H. pylori isolates from this metropolitan hospital is such that antimicrobial susceptibility data should be available so that informed choice can be made for specific eradication therapies, especially in patients who fail treatment.
