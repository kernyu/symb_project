In the past decade, biotechnology has brought veterinary medicine an increased understanding of the effects of genetic background on disease resistance and production traits. Specific point mutations have been identified for a number of genetic diseases and genetic testing; selective breeding programs can eliminate these diseases from the population. Complex traits such as disease resistance and production traits are thought to be under the control of multiple genes, making their manipulation more difficult. Because of their antiviral and immune modulating properties, interferons may be a role in the host defense against viral infection. The Type I interferon gene family has been detailed in cattle and consists of approximately 32 genes clustered together on bovine chromosome 8. These genes are very polymorphic in the population, enabling studies on the association between alleles at specific interferon loci and the severity of clinical diseases following experimental Bovine Herpesvirus-1 infection. Associations were observed between specific IFN genotypes and increased severity of clinical disease in a population of unrelated cattle. With a better understanding of IFNs at the genetic level, it may eventually be possible to manipulate the IFN response for the therapeutic benefit of cattle, and lessen the economic impact of specific diseases on cattle producers.
