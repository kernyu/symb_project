This study evaluated the in vitro activity of A-86719.1, a novel 2-pyridone antimicrobial agent. The drug inhibited all tested members of the family Enterobacteriaceae at < or = 0.5 microgram/ml and all tested Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Burkholderia (Pseudomonas) cepacia, and Xanthomonas maltophilia strains at < or = 2 micrograms/ml. All but two strains of gram-positive bacteria were inhibited by < or = 1 microgram of the new drug per ml, including isolates highly resistant to ciprofloxacin.
