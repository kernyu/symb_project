Interferons (IFN) are cytokines with a wide range of biological activities. The most important function of IFN is associated with the induction of host resistance to viral infections. This paper discusses the well-known experimental data and the results of the authors' theoretical studies of the regularities of type 1 interferon induction and its antiviral action. The mechanisms both of interferon gene expression and transcription regulation of IFN-stimulated genes by IFNs and viruses are analyzed. The molecular mechanisms of IFN-induced resistance and the well-known strategies acquired by viruses to overcome IFN action are discussed. The authors' analyze possible regulation by IFN of its own expression and the role of IFN- and virus-induced expression of genes of antiviral response in the development of resistance to infection.
