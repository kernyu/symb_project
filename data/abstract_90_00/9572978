The ribosomal protein L41 gene of Phaffia rhodozyma was cloned and used as a dominant selectable marker for cycloheximide resistance in the transformation of P. rhodozyma. Electrotransformation with a plasmid containing a ribosomal DNA fragment as a targeting signal typically yielded 800 to 1,200 transformants/microgram of DNA with an integrated copy number of about seven per haploid genome.
