Minimum inhibitory and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MIC and MBC) of daptomycin and of vancomycin have been compared against 80 strains of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus isolated from many parts of the world. In the presence of 30 mg/l of Ca++, daptomycin at 4 mg/l killed all the strains tested, and was only slightly less active than vancomycin.
