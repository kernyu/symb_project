Aminoglucoside resistance patterns of clinical strains of enteric bacteria isolated from inpatients of Moscow clinics were determined. APH(3')-I and AAC(3)-II were shown to be the most frequent. The aphA1 and aacC2 genes encoding the enzymes were cloned from the R plasmid of the transconjugant of the E. coli clinical strains. DNA probes based on the determined nucleotide sequences of the cloned genes were constructed and used in DNA-DNA hybridization experiments. The results on the occurrence of APH(3')-I and AAC(3)-II in the strains tested were confirmed by the DNA-DNA hybridization. Prospects for developing a set of DNA probes for rapid diagnosis of antibiotic resistance are discussed.
