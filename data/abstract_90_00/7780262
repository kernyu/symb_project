Three cases of recrudescence and relapse of Neisseria meningitidis group B meningitis and septicaemia are reported. The recrudescence and relapses could not be explained by infectious foci, increased bacterial penicillin resistance or immunological defects. As a supplement to antibiotic treatment, all three patients received corticosteroids for the initial 2 days of treatment, and this may have contributed to the unusual course of the disease in our patient.
