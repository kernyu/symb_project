Antibiotic efficacies were evaluated by Diff-Quik (Dade, Dudingen, Federal Republic of Germany) staining of Ehrlichia sennetsu in P388D1 murine macrophages grown in 96-well microtiter plates. Sennetsu disease is generally cured with tetracyclines. In vivo, E. sennetsu is susceptible to doxycycline and is resistant to erythromycin, penicillin, and chloramphenicol. Our study confirmed, in vitro, the efficacy of doxycycline, which had an MIC of 0.125 micrograms/ml. E. sennetsu was found to be resistant to erythromycin, chloramphenicol, penicillin, gentamicin, and co-trimoxazole, while it was very susceptible to ciprofloxacin (MIC, 0.125 micrograms/ml) and rifampin (MIC, 0.5 micrograms/ml).
