Of 516 Staphylococcus aureus strains tested, 97.1% were susceptible to quinupristin-dalfopristin, which was bactericidal for 22 (56%) of the 39 strains tested, comparable to vancomycin. All 17 clindamycin and macrolide-resistant strains were inhibited but not killed by quinupristin-dalfopristin, whereas all 22 clindamycin-susceptible strains (5 were macrolide resistant) were killed.
