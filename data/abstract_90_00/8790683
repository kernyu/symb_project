Herpes simplex encephalitis is an important disease characterized by focal haemorrhagic necrosis of the temporal and frontal lobes of the brain. The mortality rate may be as high as 70% of untreated cases. Isolation of the virus from brain tissue is the most reliable means of diagnosis. Although some non-invasive diagnostic modalities have been investigated, none is as reliable as brain tissue sampling. Despite acceptance that acyclovir sodium is the most effective drug for treatment, there is not a consensus on the dosage and duration of the antiviral therapy because some patients fail to respond and sometimes there is recurrence following therapy. We report a case of encephalitis in a previously normal host who died after a 13-day course of acyclovir therapy with isolation of HSV-type 1 from the brain post mortem.
