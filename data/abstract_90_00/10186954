Millions of people suffer from foodborne illness yearly. While most experience self-limiting events, others suffer from more serious forms of the disease. During the past 20 years, the epidemiology of foodborne diseases has evolved as new pathogens emerged. Factors that have been attributed to the increased risk for foodborne illness include new food vehicles of transmission, consumer lifestyles, and eating trends. Low-dose contamination of commercially prepared food items has caused widespread international outbreaks. In addition, increased antimicrobial resistance among foodborne pathogens is being recognized. The food industry and regulatory agencies collaborate in developing effective surveillance and investigative methods to reduce the risk for foodborne illness.
