To determine the role of recently recognized enteropathogens in childhood diarrhea in China, 221 children with diarrhea and 108 controls seen at the Beijing Children's Hospital were studied during April and May 1989. Stools were examined for ova, parasites, and rotavirus, cultured for bacterial pathogens, and probed for enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC), enteroinvasive E. coli (EIEC), enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC), and enteropathogenic adherence factor-positive (EAF+) E. coli. Pathogens were identified in 56.5% of children with diarrhea and 43.5% of controls (P = 0.04). Detection of enteropathogens was significantly greater in patients examined within 1 week of symptom onset (65%) than in patients examined later (39%; P = 0.01). ETEC was the most frequently detected pathogen in children with diarrhea, accounting for 20% of the cases. Other agents identified in patients included the following: salmonellae, 12%; rotavirus, 7%; EIEC, 7%; EHEC, 7%; members of the Aeromonas hydrophila group, 6%; EAF+ E. coli, 5%; Ascaris lumbricoides, 3%; shigellae, 3%; campylobacters, 2%; and Vibrio spp., 0.5%. The isolation rates of salmonellae (P = 0.02), EAF+ E. coli (P = 0.04), and mixed pathogens (P = 0.05) were significantly greater for diarrhea patients than for controls. Resistance to multiple antimicrobial agents occurred in 39% of the Salmonella isolates, 22% of the Aeromonas isolates, and 17% of the Shigella isolates. Multiresistant salmonellae (P = 0.05) and shigellae were recovered from diarrheal stools only. Ciprofloxacin, cefotaxime, and imipenem were the only agents tested to which all bacterial isolates were susceptible in vitro. These results suggest that both traditional and newly recognized agents are important causes of childhood diarrhea in Beijing and that therapy may be complicated by indigenous antimicrobial resistance.
