The Swedish Reference Group for Antibiotics (SRGA) is an expert committee within the Swedish Medical Society and has been working with different aspects of susceptibility testing of bacteria to antibiotics since 1978. The emphasis has been on standardization of methodology, evaluation of the in vitro activity of new and old antibiotics, and the detection and significance of resistance mechanisms in bacteria. In the following a review is presented of the work conducted by the SRGA.
