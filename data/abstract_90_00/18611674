Oral cephalosporins had been, for years, a small group of compounds belonging to the first or second-generation cephalosporins, with a limited antimicrobial spectrum. New oral first-generation cephalosporins include cefprozil and loracarbef, similar to cefadroxil and cefaclor, respectively, with activity similar to cefaclor but with pharmacokinetic improvements. Second-generation oral cephalosporins are esters of already available cephalosporins, and third-generation oral cephalosporins include a number of drugs whose activity is similar to available parenteral drugs, showing pharmacokinetic advantages and, some of them, better resistance to hydrolysis mediated by extended wide-spectrum beta-lactamases. They may be a good alternative against mild to moderate ENT infections, UTIs, STDs, lower respiratory tract and skin and soft tissue infections, mainly in the outpatient setting.
