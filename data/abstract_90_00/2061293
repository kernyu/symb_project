KatF is required for the expression of some 32 carbon starvation proteins in Escherichia coli including 6 previously identified as Pex. Mutants with the katF gene survive carbon and nitrogen starvation poorly. Many of the KatF-regulated starvation proteins are common to those induced by other stresses, and the mutant failed to develop starvation-mediated cross protection to osmotic, oxidative, and heat stresses. Furthermore, thermal resistance was not induced in the mutant by heat preadaptation, and it exhibited an altered pattern of protein synthesis at elevated temperature. Thus, KatF is a major switch that controls the starvation-mediated resistant state in E. coli.
