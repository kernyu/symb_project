Cells of mupirocin-sensitive, moderately-resistant and highly-resistant cultures of Staphylococcus aureus (mupirocin MICs 0.13, 16 and > 512 mg/l, respectively) were exposed to various concentrations of the antibiotic and examined by transmission electron microscopy. The most severe damage occurred in mupirocin-sensitive cells. Cells from moderately-resistant cultures trained in vitro to high-level mupirocin resistance were more hydrophobic than the parent cells. The antibiotic was slowly lethal to the mupirocin-sensitive strain and sub-inhibitory concentrations prevented or reduced growth of the other strains over a 6 h incubation period, irrespective of whether the drug was added at zero time or in the exponential growth phase.
