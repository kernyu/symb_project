Resistance to phosphonacetyl-L-aspartate (PALA) is caused by CAD gene amplification. The marker chromosome of a PALA-resistant cell line containing a homogeneously staining region with amplified CAD gene was introduced into PALA-sensitive Chinese hamster cells by microcell-mediated chromosome transfer. Two monochromosomal hybrids containing the marker chromosome in addition to the normal chromosome complement of sensitive cells and 1 tetraploid hybrid containing the complete genomes of donor (resistant) and recipient (sensitive) cells were studied in detail. It was shown that (i) the presence of the marker chromosome was both a necessary and a sufficient condition for the expression of the PALA-resistant phenotype; (ii) the marker chromosome underwent rearrangements in the monochromosomal hybrids, with preferential loss of non-amplified chromosomal regions, while it was not rearranged in the tetraploid hybrid; (iii) unlike the original PALA-resistant cells obtained after long-term selection in the presence of PALA, the PALA-resistant hybrids did not show chromosomal aberrations of other than the marker chromosome. This result indicates that chromosomal aberrations may be due to the selective procedure and is not an inherent property of cells containing amplified genes.
