This study was performed to characterize and compare the actions of insulin on hepatic glucose production and peripheral glucose utilization during infusions of endotoxin, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin-1 (IL-1), and a combination of IL-1 and TNF in the rat. The euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp technique was combined with a primed-constant tracer infusion of high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-purified 3H-3-glucose for estimation of whole-body glucose appearance and utilization rates; 14C-deoxyglucose (14C-DG) uptake was also measured in specific tissues following intravenous bolus administration. As expected, acute endotoxemia resulted in a significant reduction of glucose infusion during the clamp procedure (insulin concentration, 100 microU/mL), suggesting decreased insulin action. Similarly, infusion of TNF decreased the rate of glucose infusion necessary to maintain euglycemia. However, differences between endotoxin- and cytokine-treated rats were noted in whole-body glucose appearance (or disappearance) rates. Whereas endotoxin infusion predominantly decreased whole-body glucose uptake, suggesting diminished utilization in skeletal muscles, cytokine infusions were associated with a measurable hepatic glucose output despite hyperinsulinemia. In contrast, both cytokine and endotoxin administration decreased the rate of 14C-DG uptake by muscle tissue. These results demonstrate that TNF, IL-1, and endotoxin can induce a state of insulin resistance when infused continuously; the results also emphasize the complexity of regulation of glucose homeostasis during infection and sepsis.
