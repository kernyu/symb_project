There is great need to identify and characterize drug targets and chemotherapeutic strategies against malaria. Here we show that a vacuolar-network induced by the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, is a major import pathway for artemisinin, a leading, new anti-malarial that is known to be effective against drug resistant strains. We also show that artemisinin-treatment induces aberrant, budding of a vacuolar-network membrane protein and its antimalarial activity is additive with toxic sphingolipid analogues that block the network. The data suggest that artemisinin alters membrane protein export from the vacuolar-network and combinations with anti-network reagents have the potential to provide powerful new chemotherapy for drug resistant malaria.
