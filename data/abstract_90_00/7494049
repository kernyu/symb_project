The susceptibility of 428 clinical isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis to pyrazinamide was assessed by the Bactec method and the Wayne pyrazinamidase assay. The correlation between the two tests was 98.2 and 100% for susceptible and resistant strains, respectively. False resistance was seen in four (0.8%) strains with the Bactec test, and false-susceptible results occurred in two (0.5%) pyrazinamidase assays. The Bactec test is rapid and reliable, and the Bactec results correlate well with the pyrazinamidase test results, although some strains did not grow well in the test medium.
