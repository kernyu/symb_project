The minimum inhibitory concentrations of six broad-spectrum beta-lactam antimicrobial agents were determined in 1998 by use of the Etest versus a total of 502 bacteria in seven Venezuelan hospital laboratories. These data were compared with results of a similar study performed in 1997. The organisms tested included 309 recent clinical isolates of Enterobacteriaceae, 70 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 54 Acinetobacter species, and 69 oxacillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus. Extended spectrum beta-lactamase production was noted among 30% of Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates. Hyperproduction of Amp C cephalosporinase producing resistance to ceftazidime and cefotaxime was observed with 10 to 37% of isolates of Enterobacter spp., Serratia spp., and Citrobacter freundii. The overall rank order of activity of the six beta-lactams tested in this study against all clinical isolates was imipenem (96.6% susceptible) > cefepime (90.4%) > piperacillin/tazobactam (85.7%) > ceftazidime (73.5%) > cefotaxime (70.5%) > piperacillin (55.0%). These findings were very similar to those reported for 1997.
