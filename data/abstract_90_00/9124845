In a randomized crossover study involving 12 healthy volunteers, 1 g of ceftizoxime or cefotaxime was administered intravenously every 12 h for a total of three doses on two separate weekends. The duration of serum bactericidal titers (SBTs) greater than 1:2 and the time serum drug concentrations remained above the MIC (T > MIC) were determined against three clinical isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae with intermediate resistance to penicillin. The duration of SBTs and T > MIC for both antimicrobial agents exceeded 50% of the dosing interval for all isolates. Ceftizoxime's T > MIC was statistically greater than that of cefotaxime, indicating that its longer half-life in serum (1.7 h) compared with that of cefotaxime (approximately 1 h) compensates for its slightly lower microbiologic activity against the penicillin-resistant pneumococci tested in this study.
