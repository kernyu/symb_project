Listeria selective enrichment broth (LEB), University of Vermont (UVM) broth, modified UVM (MUVM) broth and Fraser broth (FB) were compared for their ability to recover cells of L. monocytogenes from heated tryptose phosphate broth. Three strains of L. monocytogenes were heated at 54 degrees C for 30 min, inoculated into enrichment broths supplemented with 400 micrograms catalase ml-1, and incubated for 8 h at 30 degrees C. After incubation for 4 h, the total viable cell populations either decreased or did not change, whereas the number of healthy (non-injured) cells of all strains increased significantly in all broths except FB inoculated with the LCDC strain. With an increase in incubation time to 8 h, the number of healthy cells of all strains increased in all broths. At 8 h, the difference between populations of total (injured plus healthy cells) and healthy cells detected in LEB inoculated with two strains was not significant. Overall, recovery of heat-treated cells was significantly higher in LEB, followed by MUVM broth, UVM broth and FB. The addition of catalase to enrichment broths significantly enhanced recovery of heat-injured cells. A slight reduction of catalase activity of heated cells of all test strains in all enrichment broths except FB was observed by extending the incubation period from 4 to 8 h. A test strain that produces relatively higher catalase activity compared to the other strains exhibited the greatest resistance to exogenous hydrogen peroxide. Enumeration of viable L. monocytogenes cells in heated foods should be done using LEB supplemented with 400 micrograms catalase ml-1 to maximize the recovery of injured cells.
