Because antioxidant enzymes may have an important role in the oxidant resistance of inflammatory cells, we investigated the mRNA levels and specific activities of manganese and copper-zinc superoxide dismutases (Mn SOD and Cu,Zn SOD), catalase (Cat), and glutathione peroxidase, as well as the concentrations of glutathione (GSH) in human neutrophils, monocytes, monocyte-derived macrophages, and alveolar macrophages. Levels of GSH and glutathione peroxidase activity in monocytes were three times higher than in neutrophils, whereas the mRNA of Cat was 50-fold and its specific activity 4-fold higher in neutrophils. Although Mn SOD mRNA levels were higher in neutrophils, enzyme activities, as well as those of Cu,Zn SOD, were similar in all phagocytic cells. Neutrophils lost their viability, assessed by adenine nucleotide depletion, within 24 h ex vivo and more rapidly if GSH was depleted. However, neutrophils were the most resistant cell type to exogenous H(2)O(2). In conclusion, high Cat activity of neutrophils appears to explain their high resistance against exogenous H(2)O(2), whereas low GSH content and GSH-related enzymes seem to account for the poor survival of human neutrophils.
