AIMS: To survey methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in New Zealand during the three years 1988-90. METHODS: Isolates and accompanying epidemiological data referred and reported to the New Zealand Communicable Disease Centre were analysed. RESULTS: MRSA was isolated from 255 persons, 235 patients and 20 healthcare staff, over the three years. The majority (84%) of persons were, or were recent, hospital patients or staff. Among hospital patients, males and patients aged 0 to 14 years were more likely to have MRSA. While most (88%) of the 145 strains identified occurred sporadically, three caused large outbreaks each involving more than 20 people. A third of the strains originated overseas, most commonly Australia or one of the Pacific Islands. The rate of MRSA isolation was higher in the North Island than the South Island. Two-thirds of the MRSA had only a low level of methicillin resistance and were not multiresistant. CONCLUSIONS: MRSA continues to be isolated only infrequently in New Zealand and has not become endemic in our hospitals.
