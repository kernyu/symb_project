The growth of cells is determined by the balance between growth-stimulatory and growth-inhibitory signals. In the present study, we demonstrate that the transfection of NIH 3T3 cells with a platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF-Blc-sis) gene induces resistance to the anticellular effects of tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Human tumor cell lines that express elevated levels of c-sis (e.g. epidermoid carcinoma, A-431) are also TNF resistant, whereas those that express no significant levels of this gene (e.g. breast adenocarcinoma, MCF-7) are TNF sensitive. Transfection of cells with the c-sis gene leads to down-modulation of TNF receptors and also a decrease in intracellular glutathione levels. Thus, our results demonstrate that over-expression of PDGF-Blc-sis by certain tumor cells can lead to their protection from the anticellular effects of TNF.
