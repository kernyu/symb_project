The metal-binding protein metallothionein (MT) confers resistance to the toxic effects of metals. Although a role for MT in metal homeostasis and protection against toxic free radicals has been suggested, no clear physiological function has been established. The ability of human monocytes to be activated by bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment provided a model to investigate the effect of zinc on both cellular activation (H2O2 production) and MT expression. In both primary human monocytes and a monocyte-derived cell line (THP-1), LPS induced activation and MT expression; it did not induce MT expression in nonmonocyte human cells. Treatment of THP-1 cells with nontoxic zinc levels increased MT accumulation. Subsequent treatment with LPS resulted in a decrease in both MT mRNA and protein levels and inhibited the ability of THP-1 cells to undergo the respiratory burst. Pretreatment with cadmium had the same inhibitory effect. We conclude that MT expression is associated with monocyte activation, and exposure to zinc or cadmium interferes with the ability of monocytes to respond to activation signals. Metallothionein may play a role in that response.
