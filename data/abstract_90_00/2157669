The class 1 major outer membrane protein of Neisseria meningitidis is a serious candidate for a meningococcal vaccine. To facilitate studies on the function of this protein, mutants were isolated that lacked this protein or the structurally related class 3 protein. These mutants were obtained by using the antibody-dependent bactericidal action of the complement system. The class 1 protein-deficient strain grew normally in vitro, whereas growth of the class 3 protein-deficient strain was slightly retarded. The class 3 protein-deficient strain displayed increased resistance to the antibiotics tetracycline and cefsulodin, which is consistent with the proposed role of the protein as a pore-forming protein. The class 1 protein was purified to homogeneity from the class 3 protein-deficient strain. Lipid bilayer experiments revealed that this protein also formed pores. The class 1 protein pores were cation selective.
