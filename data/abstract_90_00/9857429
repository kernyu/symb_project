In 1997 in western Austria, 9.9% of Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains from patients of general practitioners were resistant to imipenem as well as 18.2% of the isolates from hospitals and 20.2% of the strains at a university teaching hospital. Within the hospital the imipenem resistance varied from 9.9% among out-patients to 28.7% in isolates from intensive care units. In medical/surgical words, up to 15.1% of P. aeruginosa strains were resistant to imipenem. The incidence of imipenem-resistant P. aeruginosa strains correlates to the use of carbapenems. In June 1997, 10 consecutive isolates from 8 patients were obtained and typed using restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis (RFLP) and Pyocin typing. All 10 isolates were resistant to meropenem as well as to imipenem. The finding (by RFLP and Pyocin typing) of individual bacterial types in each isolate strongly contradicts the spread of infection by cross infection. However, all patients were proven to have been treated with imipenem during the 3 months prior to testing. In 1997, 13,880 g of imipenem were used at the university hospital in Innsbruck. The use of carbapenems appears to be the main cause for the increased incidence of imipenem-resistant P. aeruginosa strains.
