OBJECTIVE AND METHODS: Data are sparse on nonsurgical treatments currently used for osteoarticular tuberculosis in industrialized countries. We conducted a multicenter retrospective study in the Paris urban area, France, in 206 cases of osteoarticular tuberculosis documented by examination of a local specimen. This article reports our findings in the 143 patients who were followed up at least until treatment completion. RESULTS: Mean follow-up after treatment completion was 16 months. Seventy-five (52%) patients had spondylitis and 68 (48%) did not. The number of antituberculous agents used during the initial treatment phase was four in 65% of cases and three in 35%. In the spondylitis subgroup, mean (+/- SD) antibiotic therapy duration was 14.7 +/- 3.4 months, and 25% of patients required surgery; 3% of patients died, 1% suffered a relapse, and 96% achieved a full recovery with no relapse. In the nonspondylitis subgroup, mean antibiotic therapy duration was 13 +/- 3 months and 29% of patients required surgery. The only HIV-positive patient had osteitis of the calcaneus with a relapse that led to discovery of secondary rifampin resistance. CONCLUSION: Based on our findings and on data from the literature, we believe that 12 months is a reasonable duration for antituberculous therapy in osteoarticular tuberculosis, including tuberculous spondylitis.
