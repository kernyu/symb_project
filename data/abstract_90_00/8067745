Using two strains of pneumococci for which MICs of penicillin were 1 and 4 micrograms/ml, those of cefotaxime were 0.01 and 0.5 micrograms/ml, and those of teicoplanin were 0.01 and 0.1 micrograms/ml, we studied the efficacy of different dosages of penicillin, cefotaxime, and teicoplanin in the treatment of experimental pneumococcal endocarditis in rabbits. Animals treated with dosages of penicillin G procaine needed to achieve levels in serum near the MIC for pneumococci showed a significant reduction in log10 CFU per gram of vegetation, as compared with the control (P < 0.001), although only 20% of the animals showed sterile vegetations. When levels of penicillin in serum were in the range of three- to fourfold the MIC, a greater reduction in log10 CFU per gram of vegetation was seen, and 88% of the animals showed sterile vegetations. Only the regimen of penicillin that provided concentrations in serum above the MIC throughout the interval between two doses provided constant sterilization of the cardiac vegetations. Dosages of cefotaxime and teicoplanin selected to achieve concentrations in serum equivalent to that obtained in humans during treatment resulted in levels of antimicrobial agents in serum hundreds or thousands of times higher than the MICs for the infecting strains. In terms of antimicrobial efficacy, cefotaxime and teicoplanin were equivalent to regimens with high dosages of penicillin.
