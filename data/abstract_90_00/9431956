Three in vitro assays (the isotopic semimicrotest [700 microl per well; 24-well plates], the isotopic microtest [200 microl per well; 96-well plates], and the rapid in vitro test) and the standard in vivo test for chloroquine resistance were compared for 99 clinical isolates of Plasmodium falciparum obtained from symptomatic African patients. The 50% inhibitory concentrations determined by the two isotopic tests were similar and were highly correlated (r = 0.965; P < 0.05), showing a high concordance between the semimicrotest and the microtest. There was a moderate agreement between these two isotopic tests and the in vivo test. Most of the discordant results were probably due to host factors, including reinfections, pharmacokinetic variations, and immunologic response, which are eliminated in in vitro assays. The rapid in vitro test based on the inhibition of chloroquine efflux in the presence of verapamil was poorly concordant with the other tests. Despite some discordant results, isotopic in vitro assays are useful to characterize the phenotypes of individual isolates without the interference of host factors and are complementary to in vivo evaluation of drug efficacy. However, in vitro assays need to be standardized to allow direct comparison of results between different laboratories.
