Enterococcus spp. have become the third most common cause of nosocomial infections. High-level aminoglycoside resistance (HLR), an important clinical concern, has been associated with some species of the enterococci. We evaluated the Vitek and API 20S systems for species identification and the Vitek for the detection of HLR. Enterococci from nosocomial infections (208 strains) at the University of Iowa Hospital (1985-1991) were tested by Vitek, API 20S, and reference methods. The error rate for species identification was 6.7% for the API 20S and 5.8% for the Vitek Gram-positive identification (GPI) cards. Both systems tended to incorrectly identify other enterococcal species as Enterococcus faecium. HLR was found in Enterococcus faecalis and E. faecium isolates only. The highest rates of HLR to streptomycin alone (17.9%) and with gentamicin (13.5%) was observed among E. faecalis strains, and to gentamicin alone (7.3%) was found among E. faecium isolates. No apparent differences in HLR rates were found from year-to-year over the 7-year enterococcus sample interval. Susceptibility errors for Vitek were among the streptomycin tests only. Our results demonstrated acceptable performance by the Vitek cards for enterococcal species identification and the detection of HLR. API 20S also provided an acceptable ability to speciate the enterococci within its data base, however, both systems must be improved by adding other clinical important Enterococcus species.
