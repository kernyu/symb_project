The incidence of oropharyngeal candidiasis is growing. The species of the genus Candida are extremely frequent among human colonizers. The changes in the yeast-human interaction by aging, debilitating, and immunosuppressive diseases, and the more aggressive medical interventions can explain this phenomenon. Antifungals are used both in prophylaxis and therapy, but the number of available agents remains scarce. Acquired resistance to the more commonly used antifungal agents, the azole compounds, is also an increasing threat, Policies for antifungal use should be established in order to maintain the therapeutic possibilities of the current compounds, The widespread use of systemic azoles, agents useful in deep mycosis, may increasingly exert a selective power for resistant variants. Superficial infections, such as oropharyngeal candidiasis, can be successfully controlled by nystatin, a classic polyene, which is very well tolerated and has very low rates of resistance. This review on the importance of oropharyngeal candidiasis emphasizes this therapeutic possibility, and is complemented by in vitro studies documenting the excellent activity of nystatin on both azole-susceptible and resistant strains.
