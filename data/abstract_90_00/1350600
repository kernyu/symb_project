A bacteriophage M13 tandem repeat has been used to probe EcoRI digested genomic DNA of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The patterns generated were found to be useful in typing MRSA and generally confirmed the relationships that had previously been recognized in other studies based on antimicrobial resistance and plasmid profiles. The epidemic MRSA of London hospitals (EMRSA) and the majority of the epidemic MRSA of eastern Australian hospitals (EA MRSA) gave the same pattern. However, two isolates previously classified as EA MRSA gave a different pattern and a third another pattern. One isolate from Dublin, two isolates from Nuneaton and two isolates from Singapore gave the same pattern as the two EA MRSA. With the exception of the early or classic MRSA all the other isolates examined gave their own distinctive patterns. With one exception the classic MRSA belonged to a separate group. The exception was of particular interest because it gave the same pattern as the majority of the EA MRSA. This suggests that there may be an evolutionary relationship between some of the classic MRSA and the EMRSA of London and the EA MRSA of Australia.
