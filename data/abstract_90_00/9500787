Susceptibility to Fas-mediated apoptosis in nontolerant B cells is regulated in a receptor-specific fashion. To explore the regulation of Fas killing in tolerant, autoreactive B cells, mice doubly transgenic for hen egg lysozyme (HEL)-specific B cell receptors and soluble HEL were examined. Engagement of CD40 led to enhanced Fas expression and acquisition of sensitivity to Fas-mediated apoptosis in tolerant B cells, similar to that observed in nontolerant, receptor transgenic B cells. Engagement of surface immunoglobulin by specific (HEL) antigen failed to induce Fas resistance in tolerant B cells, in contrast to its effect on nontolerant B cells; however, cross-linking of biotinylated HEL with streptavidin induced similar levels of Fas resistance in tolerant and nontolerant B cells, which approximated the degree of Fas resistance produced by anti-Ig. Unlike surface Ig (sIg) engagement, physiological engagement of IL-4 receptors produced similar levels of Fas resistance in tolerant and nontolerant B cells. Thus, tolerant B cells differ from nontolerant B cells in the diminished capacity of surface immunoglobulin engagement to produce Fas resistance; however, tolerant B cells can be induced to become resistant to Fas-mediated apoptosis by IL-4 or by higher order cross-linking of sIg receptors.
