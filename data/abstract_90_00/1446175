In July 1990, the in vitro chemosensitivity of 22 isolates of Plasmodium falciparum was assessed by an isotopic semi-microtest in Yaounde, Cameroon. Out of them, 54.5% were resistant to chloroquine, 28.6% to amodiaquine, 4.8% to quinine and 4.5% had a decrease of sensitivity to mefloquine. A strong positive correlation between the IC50 of the antimalarial drugs compared by pairs was detected.
