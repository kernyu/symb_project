The MIC of norfloxacin for the norA-disrupted mutant termed RDN1, obtained from quinolone-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus RN4220, was eightfold lower than that for RN4220. The increase in susceptibility was related to an increase of drug accumulation by RDN1. These results indicate that NorA plays an important role in the susceptibility of quinolone-susceptible S. aureus to selected quinolones.
