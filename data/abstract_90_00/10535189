BACKGROUND: Nosocomial infection due Candida albicans in immunocompromised patients are recognized as a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. The endogenous forms of infections may require effective strategies for prevention which are different from those for exogenous infections due to transmission of any organism from patient to patient. Typing by PCR of isolates of C. albicans maybe useful for that. METHODS: Twenty-four isolates in blood cultures of 24 critically ill patients were studied. Typing by interrepeat PCR and in vitro antifungal susceptibility tests was performed by a microdilution. RESULTS: Twenty-one different genotypes were obtained. The isolates with same genotype shown different patterns of susceptibility. With one strain a band pattern very different from that obtained with the remaining isolates. CONCLUSIONS: No were relation between strain of same unit. The isolates with same genotype was different critically unit or year of isolation.
