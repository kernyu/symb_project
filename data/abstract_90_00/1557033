We have cloned the seven genes that are responsible for biosynthesis of the antibiotic fortimicin A (FTM A) using a recently developed self-cloning system that employes the plasmid vector pMO116 for Micromonospora olivasterospora. Five chimeric plasmids that restored FTM A production in M. olivasterospora mutants blocked at different biosynthetic steps were isolated by shotgun cloning. Secondary transformation using other non-producing mutants showed that two additional FTM A biosynthetic genes were included on these plasmids, and that at least four of the genes were clustered. Interestingly AN38-1, a non-producing mutant that had a defect in dehydroxylation of a precursor of FTM A, was complemented by the DNA fragment containing a neomycin resistance gene that had been cloned from a neomycin-producing strain (Micromonospora sp. FTM A non-producing strain) in the course of constructing the plasmid vector pMO116. These results clearly show that this novel gene cloning system in Micromonospora is of practical use.
