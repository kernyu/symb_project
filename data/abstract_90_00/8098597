Eight clinical isolates of Enterococcus faecium highly resistant to gentamicin (MIC, > 1,000 mg/liter) from patients in six hospitals on three continents were investigated for evidence of spread of either a clone of high-level gentamicin-resistant (HLGR) E. faecium or wide dissemination of a gentamicin resistance (Gmr) plasmid. A combination of ribotypes, plasmid profiles, and extended antimicrobial susceptibilities enabled us to distinguish all but two of the isolates and did not suggest clonal dissemination of a single strain. Two isolates from hospitals situated close together appeared identical by these methods. All of the isolates carried Gmr plasmids which appeared to be closely related following digestion with restriction endonucleases. Cross-hybridization studies confirmed extensive DNA homology between these plasmids. The fragments of these plasmids which hybridized with a probe specific for the aac6'aph2" resistance gene did not resemble those seen in the Gmr transposon Tn5281, which was characterized previously in E. faecalis HH22. This study suggests that there has been widespread dissemination of a single Gmr plasmid and its derivatives amongst isolates of HLGR E. faecium, although a Gmr plasmid from an HLGR E. faecium isolated in the United States showed little homology with the other Gmr plasmids studied.
