The lysosomotropic nature of amantadine suggested potential as an antimalarial. Sensitivity tests to amantadine hydrochloride alone and in combination with chloroquine were carried out in 96-well microtitre plates using the tritiated hypoxanthine uptake method to measure parasite growth. Amantadine alone has antimalarial activity. Amantadine is more potent against chloroquine-resistant strains. Combinations of amantadine and chloroquine result in slight synergy in both resistant and sensitive strains.
