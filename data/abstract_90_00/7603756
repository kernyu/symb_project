One hundred and thirty seven consecutive isolates of Neisseria gonorrhoeae and a further 36 selected gonococci with either chromosomal (CMRNG) or plasmid mediated (PPNG) resistance to penicillin, all cultured in Sydney in 1993, were found to be sensitive to cefpodoxime, an oral third generation cephalosporin antibiotic (MIC range < 0.001-0.25 mg/L). All isolates were also sensitive to ceftriaxone and spectinomycin. Six gonococci showed high level resistance to tetracycline (TRNG, MIC = 32 mg/L) and 12 had decreased susceptibility to quinolone antibiotics (MIC range 0.06-0.5 mg/L). The MIC50 and MIC90 for both cefpodoxime and ceftriaxone were highest amongst CMRNG and ceftriaxone was 2 to 4 times as active as cefpodoxime weight for weight. Cefpodoxime may be a valuable additional oral agent for the treatment of gonorrhea in Australia. The sensitivity of gonococci to cefpodoxime can probably be inferred from values obtained for ceftriaxone.
