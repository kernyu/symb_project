The activities of seven antimicrobial agents used for treatment and prophylaxis of meningococcal disease was investigated against 901 Neisseria meningitidis isolates, 112 of which were recovered from patients and 789 of which were recovered from asymptomatic carriers. The proportions of isolates with decreased susceptibility to penicillin were 55.3 and 39.0%, respectively. Penicillin- and ampicillin-intermediate strains were more common among serogroup C meningococci than among non-serogroup C meningococci from both patients and carriers.
