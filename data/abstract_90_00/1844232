In the group of 75 ALL patients treated between 1980 and 1989, two women (ages 25 and 17, both FAB-L2 and CALLA +, after 56 and 34 months of continuous CR, respectively) were found to have a relapse manifested as a local infiltration of skin, with involvement of the adjacent lymph nodes in one patient. The leukaemic character of the skin infiltration was confirmed by skin needle aspiration and tissue biopsy expressing CD10 and CD24. Both patients were given intensified systemic chemotherapy and local X-ray irradiation. Complete remission was obtained with the disappearance of the skin infiltrations followed after 13 and 8 months, respectively, followed by a marrow relapse with symptoms of CNS involvement in one case. Both patients died because of treatment resistance (the overall survival time equalled 70 and 44 months, respectively).
