The prodrug activation system formed by the E. coli codA gene encoding cytosine deaminase (CD) and 5-fluorocytosine (5-FC) developed for selective cancer chemotherapy suffers from a sensitivity limitation in many tumour cells. In an attempt to improve the CD/5-FC suicide association, we combined the E. coli upp gene encoding uracil phosphoribosyltransferase (UPRT) with codA gene to create the situation prevailing in E. coli, a bacterium very efficient in metabolising 5-FC. The constitutive expression of the two genes cloned on an E. coli-animal cell shuttle plasmid either in a linked or in a fused configuration was evaluated in E. coli strains selected and engineered to mimic the 5-FC metabolism encountered in mammalian cells. The simultaneous expression of codA and upp genes generated a cooperative effect resulting in a dramatic increase in 5-FC sensitivity of cells compared to the expression of codA alone. Furthermore, it was shown that the association of UPRT with CD facilitated the uptake of 5-FC, in the situation where the drug penetrates cells by passive diffusion as in mammalian cells, by directly channeling 5-fluorouracil, the product of CD, to 5-fluoroUMP, the product of UPRT.
