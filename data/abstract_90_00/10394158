PURPOSE: Prosthetic graft infection after aortic aneurysm surgery is a life-threatening complication. Treatment options include total graft excision and extra-anatomic bypass grafting or in situ replacement of the graft. The latter option is gaining increasing popularity, but the long-term outcome remains uncertain, particularly in light of the increasing prevalence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). We performed a prospective nonrandomized study to assess the outcome after graft excision and in situ replacement with a rifampicin-bonded prosthesis for the treatment of major aortic graft infection. METHODS: In a 6-year period from January 1992 to December 1997, 11 patients (eight men, three women) with major aortic graft infection underwent total graft excision and in situ replacement with a rifampicin-bonded prosthesis. The median age of the patients was 66 years (range, 49 to 78 years). Four patients had a hemorrhage from an aortoenteric fistula, three had a retroperitoneal abscess, two had graft occlusion, one had a perigraft collection shown by means of computed tomography, and one had a ruptured suprarenal false aneurysm. Organisms were cultured from 10 patients. RESULTS: MRSA was isolated in two patients, both of whom had originally undergone repair of a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm. Two patients died (18.2%) within 30 days, and three patients (27.6%) had nonfatal complications (peritoneal candidiasis, transient renal impairment, and profound anorexia). Two patients died late in the follow-up period. Seven patients remain alive and clinically free of infection. CONCLUSION: The long-term results after total graft excision and in situ replacement with a rifampicin-bonded prosthesis appear to be favorable. However, MRSA aortic graft infection appears to be associated with a poor prognosis.
