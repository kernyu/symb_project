We had tuberculosis infection cases of gastrointestinal tract diagnosed histopathologically during January 1980 to December 1991 in Tokyo National Chest Hospital. There were 12 cases (male 8, female 4) from 24 y.o. to 88 y.o. (mean 50 y.o.). We got histopathological specimen by operation (6 cases), biopsy (4), and section (2). Pulmonary tuberculosis was complicated in 8 cases, 7 cases had cavity formation and another case was miliary tuberculosis. Distribution of tuberculous lesion was colon (7 cases), small intestines (5), cecum (2), rectum (1) and esophagus (1). First symptom was mainly abdominal symptom such as abdominal pain and diarrhea. There were a perforative peritonitis and a intestinal obstruction during chemotherapy. Three died cases complicated low albuminemia. We suppose that serum albumin is one of the useful marker of patient's prognosis.
