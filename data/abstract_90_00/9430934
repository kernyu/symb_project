BACKGROUND: Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumanii are two important nosocomial agents that require permanent testing of their antimicrobial susceptibility. AIM: To use E-test to determine minimal inhibitory concentrations, estimate bacterial diversity and presumably identify B-lactamases of strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumanii isolated from nosocomial infections. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty eight strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumanii isolated in a teaching hospital were analyzed with E-test strips to determine their minimal inhibitory concentrations for different antimicrobials. RESULTS: More than 75% of Acinetobacter baumanii were resistant to Piperacillin, Cefpirome, Cefepime, Gentamicin or Amikacin, 40% of strains were resistant to Ceftazidime, 27 and 53% of isolates had a decreased susceptibility to Meropenem and Piperacillin-tazobactam respectively. Twenty eight to 54% of Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains were resistant to Cefepime, Cefpirome, Ciprofloxacin and Gentamicin. Eighteen and 10% of strains were resistant to Meropenem and Imipenem respectively. Less than 10% of strains were resistant to Amikacin, Azireonam, Piperacillin-tazobactam or Ceftazidime. Most of beta-lactam resistance of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was associated to decreased susceptibility or resistance to Cefpirome, Cefepime or to Meropenem-Imipenem and did not match clearly with known beta-lactamase profiles. CONCLUSIONS: The knowledge of susceptibility of these bacteria responsible for nosocomial infections, will help to plan the appropriate use of antimicrobials.
