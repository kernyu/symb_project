In Norway, infections caused by methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) are still uncommon. From December 1993 to January 1997, MRSA was isolated from 22 people in Oslo county; 17 patients and five carriers (healthcare workers). A cluster of ten people (five patients and five healthcare workers) were associated with an outbreak at two hospitals in Oslo. The five patients were all admitted to the same intensive care unit (ICU) at Ulleval University Hospital between May-July 1995 (they were not transferred from abroad) and treated for acute neurological lesions. After surgery, four of them (one died) were transferred to another hospital for rehabilitation and training. The presence of MRSA was discovered in the patients and the five healthcare workers during the 10 months June 1995-March 1996. All cluster strains showed an unusual antibiotic resistance pattern in vitro, with a relatively low degree of methicillin resistance, resistance to fusidic acid, but sensitivity to all other anti-staphylococcal agents. A clonal spread of this fusidic acid resistant MRSA was supported by strain typing using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), which showed that all ten cluster strains belonged to one type or its subtype.
