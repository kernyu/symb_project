It was shown advisable to use ribavirin (a weak inhibitor of Sindbis virus reproduction) in combination with ACAA. The effect observed was of marked synergistic nature. Subcultures of the susceptible strain in the presence of ribavirin/ ACAA did not lead to the development of resistance to ACAA, ribavirin or their combination. The ACAA resistant strain preserved its susceptibility to ribavirin after serial subcultures in the presence of both the inhibitors. However, no synergistic effect of the combination under such conditions was observed. It was of principal importance that in the subcultures of the ACAA resistant strain in the presence of ribavirin its susceptibility to ACAA recovered. ACAA was efficient in inhibition of Sindbis virus reproduction in the brain of the intracerebrally infected unimbred albino mice. The maximum inhibitory effect was observed after repeated administrations of ACAA under the treatment and prophylactic regimens. Ribavirin markedly increased the ACAA protective effect.
