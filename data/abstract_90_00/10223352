Faecal egg count reduction test (FECRT) and in vitro egg hatch assay (EHA) was performed on Indian Karakul (3/4 crosses of Karakul with Malpura, Marwari and Sonadi) transported from arid region campus, Bikaner, where resistance was reported in 1996. FECRT revealed that fenbendazole and levamisole were 100% effective in reducing the egg counts. LC50 value on EHA was 0.074 +/- 0.015 microg thiabendazole ml(-1). The faecal culture examination revealed the presence of Haemonchus contortus only. It was concluded that H. contortus was fully susceptible to both benzimidazole and levamisole.
