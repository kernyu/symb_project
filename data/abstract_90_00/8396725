The transducing ability of 17 Pseudomonas pseudomallei bacteriophages has been studied. Five of them were found to be capable of transducing the transposon Tn7 markers TpR, SmR into the strain Pseudomonas mallei C-5. The transduced bacterial recipients became lysogenic and acquired resistance to trimethoprim and streptomycin. Transduction of transposon Tn7 has been confirmed by DNA-DNA hybridization.
