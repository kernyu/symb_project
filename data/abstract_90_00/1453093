Since 1985, tuberculosis case counts in the United States have increased, primarily because of the influence of the HIV epidemic. In addition, during this time outbreaks of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis among patients with AIDS or HIV infection have been reported in New York City and Florida. These outbreaks have occurred in hospitals and prisons and have been characterized by high case fatality rates, disease transmission within the institutions, and high infection rates in health care workers. The increase in tuberculosis rates and the outbreaks have raised concern that multidrug-resistant tuberculosis could become a widespread problem in the United States. Dealing with tuberculosis in the 1990s will require reconsideration of our current methods of tuberculosis prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and control.
