A cross-adaptive response (CAR), defined as a reduction of the effects of an agent by pretreatment with another agent, was demonstrated when E. coli WP2 cells were pretreated with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) followed by challenging treatment with aldehyde compounds. Pretreatment with a sublethal dose (60 microM) of H2O2 for 30 min made WP2 cells resistant to the killing effects of formaldehyde (FA), and 4 other mutagenic aldehydes: glutaraldehyde, glyoxal, methyl glyoxal and chloroacetaldehyde. CAR was also observed in WP2uvrA (uvrA-) and ZA12 (umuC-) cells, but not in ZA60 (recA-) and CM561 (lexA- (Ind-] cells. A role of recA and lexA in CAR was further suggested by the lack of beta-galactosidase induction in recA- and lexA- cells by H2O2. CAR and beta-galactosidase induction, however, were found to be separate events since CAR was recovered by introducing the recA+ gene into lexA- cells, but no induction of beta-galactosidase by H2O2 was observed in cells with the same gene transfer. These results suggest that H2O2 has the capacity to induce a function which reduces the killing effects of aldehydes, and the function is controlled by the recA gene without involvement of SOS response.
