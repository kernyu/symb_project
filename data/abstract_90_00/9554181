Four hundred thirteen Staphylococcus sp. were identified by Staphaurex, Staphaurex Plus, and BACTiStaph kits using tube coagulase as reference. Among 222 coagulase-positive isolates, 56 were oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. All tests were accurate in distinguishing between coagulase-positive and -negative staphylococci with sensitivities and specificities > or = 97% and only nine discrepancies.
