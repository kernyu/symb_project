This article discusses the tick-borne babesiases which harm dairy cattle, buffaloes and dogs. In addition, the pathogen, vector, seasonal occurrence, hosts, symptoms, pathological changes and treatment are summarized and analysed. The pathogens in this area were identified as Babesia bigemina, B. bovis and B. gibsoni; the vectors as Boophilus microplus, Rhipicephalus haemaphysaloides, Haemaphysalis longicornis. Affected buffaloes were found from April to September, peak numbers occurred between May and July. Affected dairy cattle were most numerous in July and August. Hunting dogs were the most affected dogs. Infected dogs were found from February until the beginning of December; peak numbers occurred from September to November. Affected animals were acute cases. Symptoms and pathological changes were obvious, but jaundice was rare in dogs. Acaprin, acriflavine, imidocarb and berenil were used early and late. Their effect was ideal but resistance has developed to these drugs.
