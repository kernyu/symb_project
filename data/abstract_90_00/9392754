Antimicrobial resistance has become an issue of global proportion, and this dilemma has greatly affected the intensive care unit (ICU) setting. Increased antimicrobial use and other selective pressures have created an environment in the ICU that is a testing ground for survival of microorganisms. By various mechanisms, gram-positive cocci and gram-negative bacilli are becoming more resistant to our current armamentarium of antimicrobials. Strategies to improve the current situation of reduced microbial susceptibility include the following: continued and specific surveillance in ICUs, antimicrobial protocols, continued isolation precautions and appropriate handwashing, increased education at all levels, increased use of immunotherapies, better use of our current antimicrobial agents, and increased research in finding new and innovative antimicrobial agents while curtailing the marketing ploys that promote excessive and inappropriate use of these valuable medications.
