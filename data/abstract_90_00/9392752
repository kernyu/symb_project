Antibiotics are commonly used, even overused, in the intensive care unit (ICU) patient population. These agents, though useful and often lifesaving, are associated with many toxicities. These include infusion-related problems, allergic reactions, organ-system toxicities, drug accumulation in patients with renal disease, drug interactions, antibiotic resistance, diarrhea, interference with laboratory tests, and more. Informed vigilance by the ICU nurse can be helpful in increasing the benefit/toxicity ratio associated with these agents.
