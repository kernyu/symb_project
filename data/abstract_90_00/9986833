Fifty methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) initial isolates obtained from patients hospitalized in the orthopedic clinic of the Frankfurt University Hospital and 150 methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) isolates were investigated in this study to determine whether the Slidex Staph-Kit is capable of differentiating between MRSA and MSSA owing to its unique performance characteristics. The Slidex Staph-Kit is a combined latex hemagglutination test designed to detect clumping factor, protein A, and a specific surface immunogen for S. aureus. Clumping factor-positive strains cause erythrocytes sensitized with fibrinogen to hemagglutinate, thereby resulting in visible red clumps. S. aureus strains deficient in clumping factor agglutinate latex particles sensitized with specific antibodies against surface proteins of S. aureus, thereby resulting in visible white clumps. Our results demonstrate that white clumping has a 99% specificity as well as a 98% positive predictive value for MRSA. Clumping factor-negative MRSA, which have been reported to occur in several countries, are epidemic in the Frankfurt area and account for 80% of all MRSA initial isolates in the orthopedic clinic of the Frankfurt University Hospital. Genotyping of all MRSA isolates by macrorestriction analysis of chromosomal DNA revealed that 83% of clumping factor-negative MRSA are closely related to the "southern-German" epidemic strain. This is the first study demonstrating the Slidex Staph-Kit's capability for identifying epidemic clumping factor-negative S. aureus strains as methicillin resistant even prior to antimicrobial susceptibility testing.
