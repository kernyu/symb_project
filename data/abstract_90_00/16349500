Knowledge of the mechanism of pressure-induced inactivation of microorganisms could be helpful in defining an effective, relatively mild pressure treatment as a means of decontamination, especially in combination with other physical treatments or antimicrobial agents. We have studied the effect of high pressure on Lactobacillus plantarum grown at pH 5.0 and 7.0. The classical inactivation kinetics were compared with a number of events related to the acid-base physiology of the cell, i.e., activity of F(0)F(1) ATPase, intracellular pH, acid efflux, and intracellular ATP pool. Cells grown at pH 5.0 were more resistant to pressures of 250 MPa than were cells grown at pH 7.0. This difference in resistance may be explained by a higher F(0)F(1) ATPase activity, better ability to maintain a DeltapH, or a higher acid efflux of the cells grown at pH 5.0. After pressure treatment at 250 MPa, the F(0)F(1) ATPase activity was decreased, the ability to maintain a DeltapH was reduced, and the acid efflux was impaired. The ATP pool increased initially after mild pressure treatment and finally decreased after prolonged treatment. The observations on acid efflux and the ATP pool suggest that the glycolysis is affected by high pressure later than is the F(0)F(1) ATPase activity. Although functions related to the membrane-bound ATPase activity were impaired, no morphological changes of the membrane could be observed.
