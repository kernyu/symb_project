The emergence of drug-resistant strains of HIV virus and treatment failure can result from non-adherence to antiretroviral therapy. While non-adherence to therapy is not a new issue or specific to HIV/AIDS, it has received renewed attention because of the complicated combination treatment regimens being prescribed. This paper reviews the relevant background literature on the contributions of social and behavioural science to non-adherence to HIV medications. Data indicating problems with adherence prior to combination therapy are reported. Despite limitations, even self-report assessments have already succeeded in showing that adherence to combination therapy is significantly related to HIV viral load. Recent research data are discussed. Implications of findings for counselling patients to increase their adherence are presented.
