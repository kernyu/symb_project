We report the prevalence of bacterial pathogens isolated from various clinical specimens in 17 medical centers in Akita during the period of December 1990 to February 1991, and their antimicrobial susceptibility. The results were as follows: 1. The total number of isolates was 8,929 and common bacteria were Staphylococcus aureus (18.7%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (11.8%), Escherichia coli (10.1%), coagulase negative staphylococcus (6.7%) and Enterococcus faecalis (5.0%). This is similar to our previous result which was reported in the same season in 1987. 2. S. aureus was a common isolate from sputum, throat swab, pus, and blood. 53% of isolated S. aureus were methicillin-resistant. Arbekacin (ABK) had a high degree of activity (99%) against methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). Minocycline (MINO) retained activity against 70% of MRSA strains, and quinolones only 20%. 3. P. aeruginosa and E. coli were frequently found in urine from the patients in the small hospitals. More than 80% of the P. aeruginosa strains were sensitive to imipenem (IPM), cefsulodin (CFS) and amikacin (AMK). The susceptibility of P. aeruginosa to ceftazidime (CAZ) and piperacillin (PIPC) had been decreasing for the last 3 years. 4. CNS were frequently found in blood, pus, and pleural effusion from the patients in the large hospitals. The isolates were resistant to most antibiotics. 5. Enterococcus was common isolates from urine and ascites, the susceptibility to cephem was low. 6. We conclude that attention should be specially paid to S. aureus, P. aeruginosa CNS and E. Faecalis.
