The results are presented of in vitro investigations of the sensitivity of 225 strains of yeast-like fungi to nystatin. The strains were isolated from cutaneous and mucosal lesions. In the study nystatin concentration 10 micrograms/ml of the substrate was used and a two-grade scale of evaluation was applied: sensitive or resistant to the drug. It was found that 56.7% of the tested strains were resistant to this nystatin concentration. The obtained data were compared with those obtained in 1972 when all the tested strains were sensitive to nystatin in this concentration. The study showed that the resistance to nystatin has been rising in these organisms with years.
