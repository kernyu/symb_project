(1) Recent consensus recommendations agree that first-line treatment of HIV infection should consist of a three-drug regimen combining a protease inhibitor and two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Some recommendations specifically advise against using the current formulation of saquinavir, but none express a preference for one of the other three protease inhibitors currently marketed in France (indinavir, nelfinavir and ritonavir). (2) These HIV protease inhibitors have established efficacy on viral load and the CD4+ lymphocyte count. Saquinavir may have lower virological efficacy. (3) The clinical efficacy of three-drug regimens containing indinavir or saquinavir is well demonstrated in patients at an advanced stage of HIV disease. (4) The risk of viral resistance is not currently a factor in choosing a HIV protease inhibitors. (5) Several epidemiological studies have compared the risk of adverse effects on three-drug regimens including indinavir, ritonavir or saquinavir. In these studies saquinavir was the best-tolerated drug and ritonavir the worst-tolerated. (6) Ritonavir interacts with many drugs. The poor bioavailability of the current saquinavir formulation also leads to risk of interactions. (7) Treatment constraints differ from one protease inhibitor to another, and these must be taken into account case by case. (8) The daily cost of treatment is not currently an important factor in choosing among the various preparations. (9) Taking into account efficacy, adverse effects, interactions and treatment constraints, the combination of indinavir with two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors currently seems to be the best choice for the largest number of patients. (10) If problems of compliance arise, nelfinavir can be an alternative to indinavir. (11) In patients at an advanced stage of HIV disease who comply well with their treatment, saquinavir can also be an alternative to indinavir.
