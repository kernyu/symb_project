Resting T cells can be activated by selected pairs of anti-CD2 MoAb. Activation is dependent on the presence of accessory cells, which can be replaced by either anti-CD28, or by the combination of IL-1 beta and IL-6. The present study was undertaken to investigate accessory signalling by B7-1, the natural ligand of CD28, in this pathway of T cell activation. 3T6 mouse fibroblasts were transfected with human B7-1 and used as accessory cells in cultures of purified resting human T cells. In the presence of a stimulating pair of anti-CD2 MoAb, T cell proliferation, production of cytokines (IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, GM-CSF, IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha), and generation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes were all supported by B7-1(+) 3T6 cells but not by control 3T6 cells. Blocking studies with anti-IL-2 + anti-IL-2R MoAb revealed both IL-2-dependent and IL-2-independent CTL generation after B7-1-mediated costimulation. Moreover, a partial or complete resistance to inhibition with CsA was observed for IL-2 production and CTL generation respectively in the presence of the costimulatory signal derived from B7-1-CD28 interaction. Anti-CD2 MoAb with B7-1 costimulation could directly induce proliferation, IL-2 production and generation of CTL activity in highly purified CD8+ T cells without the help of CD4+ T cells. We conclude that CD28 ligation with the natural ligand B7-1 provides a strong accessory signal for CD4 and CD8 cell activation through CD2.
