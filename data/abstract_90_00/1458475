A human lymphoblastoid line (RPMI-1788), a methotrexate-sensitive human fibrosarcoma cell line (HT-1080), and a naturally resistant mixed mesodermal human sarcoma cell line with impaired methotrexate polyglutamylation (HS-42), recently established in our laboratory, were used to compare the ability of leucovorin to prevent trimetrexate cytotoxicity. Growth inhibition and an in situ thymidylate synthesis activity assay showed that inhibitory effects of trimetrexate (1 to 10 microM), 24-h exposure, were prevented by 10 microM leucovorin in the RPMI-1788 and HT-1080 cell lines but not in the HS-42 cell line. Total intracellular reduced folates increased about 2-fold in the three cell lines after exposure to leucovorin (10 microM) for 4 h, and after a 6-hour efflux remained elevated (1.5- and 1.3-fold of control levels) in RPMI-1788 and HT-1080 cells but decreased to 80% of control levels in HS-42 cells. Although uptake of leucovorin and levels of N5,N10-methylenetetrahydrofolate achieved after leucovorin administration were similar in RP-MI-1788 and HS-42 cells, polyglutamylate forms of this coenzyme were less in the HS-42 cells as compared to RPMI-1788 cells. Based on these studies, the combination of trimetrexate with leucovorin should be further investigated as a way to increase the therapeutic index in some patients with soft tissue sarcomas.
