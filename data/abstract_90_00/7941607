The treatment of tuberculosis consists of a combination of at least 3 antituberculosis drugs to prevent occurrence of resistance. Each drug is discussed in detail. Different therapy regimens are described taking into consideration ethnic origin, compliance and underlying diseases of the patients. Standard therapy consists of a short course therapy including rifampicin, isoniazid and pyrazinamide for 6 months. Duration of therapy is extended in immunocompromised patients and in particular organ manifestations of the disease (i.e. meningitis etc.). Intermittent therapy improves compliance of the patients. Four-drug-regimens are recommended until the results of drug susceptibility tests are available in patients originating of countries with high prevalence of resistant strains.
