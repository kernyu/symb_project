Klebsiella oxytoca 1731, which showed a wide spectrum of resistance to beta-lactams, including cefoxitin, was isolated in 1994 from a patient in Genoa, Italy. This strain contained a plasmid-mediated AmpC beta-lactamase with a pI of 7.25. Sequencing of the corresponding DNA of K. oxytoca 1731 revealed 96 and 97% identities of the deduced amino acid sequence with FOX-1 and FOX-2, respectively.
