An overview of the antibiotic resistance of important bacteria of infectious disease in 1996 in the district of Weser-Ems in Lower Sexonie among farm animals, dogs and cats is given. The bacteria isolated from different materials as animal body, organ, droppings, milk, swabs from nose, cervix or other source and their resistance pattern were listed belonging to species and localisation of their isolation. By means of different counts of isolation one can see the importance of the isolated bacteria at the ITT, Institut fur Tierzucht, Tierhaitung und Tiergesundheit, of the Landwirtschaftskammer Weser-Ems in Oldenburg. The development of resistance of bacteria obtained from dairy cows with mastitis and in general some important antibiotics like cefoperazon, ceftiofur and enrofloxacine is shown. Furthermore more detailed instructions to the method of microbiological resistance testing, the broth microdilution method, are given.
