Intraperitoneal vancomycin is used in the treatment of peritonitis in patients undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). We describe the emergence of low-level glycopeptide-resistance in five Gram-positive species over a one-year period. Isolation of these organisms was associated with vancomycin treatment failure in four patients who had had numerous episodes of peritonitis. Clinicians and microbiologists should be aware that repeated administration of glycopeptides to such patients might lead to the emergence of organisms resistant to these antibiotics.
