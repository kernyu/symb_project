Most point substitutions in the highly-conserved 885-GDTDS motif of the HSV-1 DNA polymerase inactivate polymerase elongation activity. However, in an assay system based on expression by in vitro transcription-translation, the mutant GDTDA (S889A) possessed wild-type elongation activity which was highly resistant to phosphonoacetic acid and acyclovir triphosphate, but retained sensitivity to aphidicolin.
