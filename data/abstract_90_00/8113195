Escherichia coli rnhA mutants lacking RNase HI chronically express the SOS response (T. Kogoma, X. Hong, G. W. Cadwell, K. G. Barnard, and T. Asai, Biochimie 75:89-99, 1993). Seventeen rpoB (Rifr) mutant alleles, which encode altered beta subunits of RNA polymerase, giving rise to resistance to rifampin, were screened for the ability to enhance or diminish constitutive expression of the SOS response in rnhA mutants. Two mutations, rpoB3595 and rpoB2, were found to enhance the SOS response 5- and 2.5-fold, respectively, only when RNase HI is absent. These mutations rendered rnhA mutant cells very sensitive to broth; i.e., the plating efficiency of the double mutants was drastically reduced when tested on broth plates. Two mutations, rpoB8 and rpoB3406, were found to diminish constitutive SOS expression in rnhA mutants by 43 and 30%, respectively. It was suggested that RNA polymerase may have a property that influences the size of DNA-RNA hybrids, the frequency of their formation, or both and that the property resides at least in part in the beta subunit of the polymerase.
