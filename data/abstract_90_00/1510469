Auxotrophic, drug-resistant, nitrate-nonutilizing, and albino mutants have been isolated in Gibberella fujikuroi following UV mutagenesis. Protoplasts of complementing auxotrophic strains, mutants with resistance markers, or mutants blocked in different steps of the nitrate assimilatory pathway have been fused to form heterokaryons, diploids, or recombinant haploids. The properties of fusant strains, including gibberellic acid productivity, have been examined and compared to parent strains.
