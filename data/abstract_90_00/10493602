Many studies and meeting reports have suggested that the use of some antibiotics in food animals can compromise the treatment of some infectious diseases in humans. Although the studies and reports are timely and important, it is difficult to assess the relative value of the conclusions in relationship to the overall situation concerning antibiotic resistant foodborne bacteria because the data used in the analyses are often of disparate origin. The studies have attempted to establish a cause and effect relationship between the use ('consumption') of antibiotics in food animals and treatment failures in human disease on the basis of [1] antibiotic usage data; [2] in vitro determinations of antibiotic susceptibility of animal and human isolates, [3] results obtained from controlled animal experiments or [4] epidemiological data. Each approach has sought to associate bacterial antibiotic resistance data with it's own immediate focus area of investigation. However, a true assessment of the degree of contribution to human antibiotic resistance problems from animal use can only be facilitated by comprehensively organizing these different approaches into a concerted, coordinated effort. Concurrently, the implementation of a multinational programme aimed at monitoring antibiotic usage in food animals and resistance in specific bacteria associated with those animals should be instituted. In parallel with this endeavour is the implementation of new prudent use guidelines for antibiotic use by veterinarians. Through the use of science-based approaches like these, the development and spread of antibiotic resistant bacteria associated with food animals could be minimized and contained.
