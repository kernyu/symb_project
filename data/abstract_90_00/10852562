An experiment was conducted to determine (i) the effects of antibiotic regimens on the shedding patterns of pigs infected with Salmonella Typhimurium and (ii) whether antibiotic resistance increases the incidence of pathogen shedding. The experiment involved 48 50-day-old pigs challenged with Salmonella Typhimurium and receiving one of four antibiotic regimens including (i) intramuscular injection of ceftiofur sodium followed by inclusion of oxytetracycline in the feed; (ii) apramycin in the feed for 14 days followed by oxytetracycline; (iii) carbadox in the feed until pigs reached 35 kg followed by oxytetracycline; (iv) no antibiotics (control). Fecal samples were collected preinoculation, 2 and 4 days postinoculation (DPI) and at weekly and biweekly intervals thereafter to determine shedding patterns. Salmonella Typhimurium isolates from 2, 4, 7, 21, 42, and 70 DPI were analyzed for antibiotic resistance. A time effect (P < 0.05) was observed, indicating that the proportion of isolates resistant to at least one antibiotic varied over time. Overall resistance was determined to be 46% at 2 DPI and increased significantly (P < .05) thereafter. Treatment x time and antibiotic x time interactions were also observed (P < 0.05) as the percentage of isolates resistant to each test antibiotic increased over time. In no case did the development of antibiotic resistance result in an increased incidence of shedding of the original inoculate. The incidence of shedding was reduced in pigs receiving the apramycin-oxytetracycline treatment, when compared to control pigs; however, no differences were observed between antibiotic treatments.
