The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of iron depletion obtained by phlebotomy to enhance interferon response in 11 patients who had failed to respond to a standard 3-month interferon treatment. Despite a significant effect on serum aminotransferase levels, there was no effect on viremia, and iron depletion was unable to trigger interferon response.
