The segmental distribution and sequential progression and the role of the indigenous bacterial flora in the development of enteric lesions associated with Serpulina hyodysenteriae infection in laboratory mice have not been defined. We examined the distribution and sequential morphometric changes in the large intestine of mice orally inoculated with S. hyodysenteriae serotypes 2 and 4. To determine the role of colonization resistance conferred by the indigenous bacterial flora, 40 female C3H/HeN mice were administered water alone or water containing 5 mg/mL streptomycin sulfate ad libitum for seven days prior to orogastric inoculation either with S. hyodysenteriae or sterile trypticase soy broth (TSB). Clinical signs were monitored daily and three mice per group were necropsied on postinoculation days (PID) 7 and 14 for pathological assessment of the cecum, proximal colon, transverse colon, and descending colon, and bacteriological culture of the cecum for S. hyodysenteriae. Weekly pooled fecal samples were collected from each group for determination of total numbers of anaerobe bacteria. Gross examination revealed soft fecal pellets on PID 7 and 14 and catarrhal typhlitis on PID 14, irrespective of streptomycin pretreatment. The recovery rates of S. hyodysenteriae from the ceca of serotype 2- and serotype 4-inoculated mice was 100 and 91.7%, respectively. Statistically significant differences in morphometric changes between TSB- and S. hyodysenteriae-inoculated mice were present on PID 7 and 14 and were restricted to the cecum. Although oral administration of streptomycin for seven days prior to S. hyodysenteriae inoculation resulted in a significant reduction in the numbers of fecal anaerobes, it did not affect the colonization, distribution, severity, or progression of cecal lesions.
