In Esteli, Las Segovias, Nicaragua, the frequency of isolations of enteropathogenic (EPEC), and enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) was investigated in 100 children with (n = 50) and without diarrhoea (n = 50). EPEC was found to be significantly (p < 0.05) more frequent in diarrhoeal (16%) than in healthy children (4%). Detailed analyses revealed that 6 serotypes of E. coli were involved. Isolation of ETEC was not statistically significantly different (p > 0.05) in diarrhoeal (28%) and healthy children (16%). Determination of the susceptibility of isolated E. coli indicated a high level of resistance to common antimicrobial drugs. These resistant strains of E. coli might become a health problem in this part of Nicaragua.
