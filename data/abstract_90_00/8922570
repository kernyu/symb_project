In a randomized, prospective, multicenter trial, 227 children ranging in age from 3 to 17 years who had tonsillopharyngitis and a throat culture positive for group A beta-hemolytic streptococci (GABHS) were treated with erythromycin estolate (40 mg/kg/d in two divided doses for five days) or penicillin V (30 mg/kg/d in three divided doses for ten days). Clinical signs and symptoms of tonsillopharyngitis were recorded, and throat cultures were obtained before treatment as well as one to three days and six weeks after treatment. Clinical success (cure and improvement) was observed on days 6 to 8 in 100 of 102 (98%) assessable children treated with erythromycin estolate and on days 11 to 13 in 97 of 99 (98%) assessable children treated with penicillin V. Of all patients showing clinical success, 11 were rated as improved, all of whom were treated with erythromycin estolate. There was a trend towards increased use of analgesic treatment in the erythromycin estolate group (41% vs 33%). On completion of treatment, the rate of eradication of GABHS was 83.3% in the erythromycin estolate group compared with 87.9% in the penicillin V group. The difference is not significant but does not take into account patients excluded because of erythromycin resistance (3.7%). Clinical recurrence was observed in 11 (10.8%) patients treated with erythromycin estolate and in 6 (6.1%) patients treated with penicillin V (non-significant difference). Compliance in the erythromycin estolate group was statistically superior to that in the penicillin V group. The incidence and nature of adverse events were similar in both treatment groups.
