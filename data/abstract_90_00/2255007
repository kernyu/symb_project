We measured the DNA content of bone marrow (BM) aspirate by flow cytometry (FCM) in 41 cases of acute leukemia (AL) and found no remarkable relation between pretreatment DNA index and percentage of proliferative cells and prognosis (P greater than 0.05). After chemotherapy, reduction of proliferative cells rate, disappearance of DNA aneuploidy and decrease of leukemic cells in BM could be considered as the reliable indicators of effective treatment. Complete remission (CR) rate was significantly higher in patients responsive to treatment (81.82%) than in those unresponsive (22.22%; P less than 0.05). It seems that these parameters may serve as indicators of efficiency of chemotherapy and be useful in monitoring regimen in time and in reducing the occurrance of chemotherapy-resistance, thereby facilitating individualization of chemotherapy in AL patients.
