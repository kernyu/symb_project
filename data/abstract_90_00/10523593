We describe the second known case of human infection by Trichoderma harzianum. A disseminated fungal infection was detected in the postmortem examination of a renal transplant recipient and confirmed in culture. The only other reported infection by this fungus caused peritonitis in a diabetic patient. The in vitro antifungal susceptibilities of the clinical strain and three other strains of Trichoderma species to six antifungal drugs are provided. This case illustrates the widening spectrum of opportunistic Trichoderma spp. in immunocompromised patients and emphasizes the problems in diagnosing invasive fungal diseases.
