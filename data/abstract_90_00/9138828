As many as 254 patients with acute pyelonephritis were evaluated for the whole range of possible inflammatory process pathogens with the aid of automatic microbiological system [symbol: see text]. Urine from the urinary bladder, renal pelves (as directed) was studied as was biopsy specimen of the kidney. Analysis of species range of the identified organisms showed Escherichia coli, Proteus, and mycoplasma, enterobacter, coccal flora and pseudomonads to be in 27.9%, 15.9%, 14.9%, 8.6%, and 5.5% respectively. Analysis of sensitivity of the discovered bacteria toward a wide range of antibacterial preparations permitted recommending for an urgent antiinflammatory therapy thienam, ophloxacin, cyprophloxacin, pephloxacin, norphloxacin, cephoxitin, and cephtriaxone. The form of the preparation (parenteral or peroral) will be prescribed depending upon the gravity of the course of acute pyelonephritis.
