Cepharanthin is a proprietary extract of Stephania cepharantha, widely used in Japan for the treatment of inflammatory diseases. Cephranthin, its component alkaloids, and the standard resistance modulator verapamil were tested against Plasmodium falciparum for capacity to modulate sensitivity to chloroquine. Cepharanthin enhanced the activity of chloroquine against resistant clones by a factor of 15 at a concentration of only 200 nM (1.2 ng/ml). It is 50 times more potent than verapamil and 3 times more potent than the sum of its individual alkaloids. Combinations of component alkaloids acted synergistically to sensitize the parasite to chloroquine, possibly explaining the enhanced potency of Cepharanthin. Cepharanthin differed from verapamil in that it further sensitized clones that are considered to be fully susceptible, improving the baseline activity of chloroquine. Potent sensitization of parasites to chloroquine in vitro coupled with low toxicity suggests that coadministration of Cepharanthin might extend the clinical utility of chloroquine.
