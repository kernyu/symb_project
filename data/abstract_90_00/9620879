The kinetics of reaction of solubilized penicillin-binding protein 2a (sPBP2a) of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus with a variety of beta-lactams and acyclic species was studied in homogeneous aqueous solution at 37 degreesC in 25 mM Hepes buffer, pH7.0, containing 1 M NaCl. Under these conditions, but not at lower salt concentrations, protein precipitation did not occur either during or after the reaction. The reactions of beta-lactams in general could be monitored by competition with a chromophoric beta-lactam, nitrocefin, or directly in certain cases by protein fluorescence. Rate constants for reaction of a wide variety of beta-lactams are reported. The interactions are characterized by a slow second-order acylation reaction followed by a slower deacylation. For example, the rate constants for benzylpenicillin were 12 M-1.s-1 and 3x10(-5) s-1 respectively. The acylation is slow in comparison with those of normal non-resistant high-molecular-mass penicillin-binding proteins. sPBP2a also seemed to catalyse the slow hydrolysis of a variety of acyclic depsipeptides but not that of a d-Ala-d-Ala peptide. The reactions with certain depsipeptides also led to protein precipitation. These reactions were, however, not affected by prior blockage of the beta-lactam-binding site by benzylpenicillin and thus might take place elsewhere on the enzyme. Two classes of potential transition- state analogue inhibitors, phosphonate monoesters and boronates, seemed to have little effect on the rate of reaction of sPBP2a with nitrocefin and therefore seem to have little affinity for the beta-lactam-binding/D,D-peptidase site.
