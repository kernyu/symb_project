YU-311 is a monoclonal antibody reacting with cytosine arabinoside (AraC)-resistant human leukemic cell line and identifies a 92 kDa membrane protein. We have examined YU-311 reactivity with various hematopoietic disorders by an immunohistochemical method and evaluated a correlation between YU-311 expression and refractoriness to chemotherapy, retrospectively. YU-311 reacted with AraC-resistant human leukemia cell lines, in which a 92 kDa membrane protein was identified by Western blotting, whereas drug-resistant cell lines to other than AraC failed to express YU-311 antigen. The frequency of YU-311 positivity was significantly increased in relapsed cases. Only five cases were positive for YU-311 at diagnosis and 24 cases at relapse. Unexpectedly, only eight cases of relapsed leukemia/lymphoma expressed YU-311 and P-glycoprotein simultaneously. Most of the YU-311-positive relapsed cases showed clinical refractoriness for chemotherapy and then failed to induct complete remission or relapsed at short periods with short disease-free duration. These findings indicate that YU-311 expression is closely associated with some aspects of drug resistance, especially with AraC resistance.
