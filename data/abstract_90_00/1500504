Agar dilution with and without 4% NaCl, broth microdilution with 2% NaCl, the dried MicroScan Rapid Positive MIC 1 panel (Baxter Health Care Corp., West Sacramento, Calif.), the Vitek GPS-SA card (Vitek Systems, Hazelwood, Mo.), and the oxacillin agar screen plate were compared with a DNA probe encoding the mec gene for their abilities to detect oxacillin resistance in 506 clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus. The results of testing for the mec gene showed that there were 254 oxacillin-resistant and 252 oxacillin-susceptible isolates of S. aureus. There were 14.2% very major errors with Vitek (a resistant isolate was interpreted as susceptible) and 6.7% very major errors with MicroScan. Fewer major errors were seen: 0.8% with MicroScan (a susceptible isolate was interpreted as resistant) and 0.4% with Vitek. No very major errors but 2.4% major errors occurred by agar dilution with 4% NaCl supplementation, whereas there were 0.8% very major and 0.4% major errors without 4% NaCl supplementation. By broth microdilution there were 2.0% very major and 0.8% major errors. The results of the oxacillin agar screen plate method were 100% concordant with those of the mec gene probe method.
