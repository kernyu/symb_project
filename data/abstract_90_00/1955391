Enterobacter cloacae NUH10 was isolated at Nagasaki University Hospital in 1987. E. cloacae NUH10 is a mutant strain which produces high levels of cephalosporinase. E. cloacae ATCC 23355 is known to be sensitive to so-called third generation cephems and produces an inducible cephalosporinase. The polyclonal antibody to cephalosporinase extracted from E. cloacae NUH10 was utilized in post-embedding immunogold labeling in order to localize this protein in E. cloacae ATCC 23355 and E. cloacae NUH10. Immunocytochemical localization of the cephalosporinase in both strains was observed with and without incubation with an inducer. Cephalosporinase was detected in both the cytoplasm and periplasmic space of E. cloacae ATCC 23355 and E. cloacae NUH10 incubated in medium including cefoxitin as an inducer. In the case of incubation without the inducer, a small quantity of cephalosporinase was located in the periplasmic space in either strain of bacteria. Western blot analysis showed that cephalosporinase was predominantly localized in the periplasmic space rather than in the cytoplasmic space.
