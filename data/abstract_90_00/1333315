Dendritic herpetic keratitis developed in a 49-year-old patient during topical acyclovir treatment. A positive herpes simplex culture was obtained. After acyclovir was replaced by trifluorothymidine and interferon, the dendritic lesion disappeared and herpes simplex culture became negative. Six months later a carcinoma of the larynx was diagnosed. The acyclovir-resistant herpetic keratitis may be associated with the carcinoma because resistant herpes simplex virus strains are predominantly described in patients suffering from immune deficiency.
