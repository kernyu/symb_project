The in vitro antimicrobial activity of an oral penem, WY-49605, was compared with those of six other oral antimicrobial agents against 598 bacterial isolates representing 51 different species. WY-49605 exhibited good activity against most gram-positive bacteria and members of the family Enterobacteriaceae. It had little activity against nonfermenting gram-negative bacilli, Enterobacter spp., Serratia spp., enterococci, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Its activity was unaffected by the beta-lactamases of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Haemophilus influenzae, and staphylococci. Disk diffusion susceptibility tests were performed with 5-, 10-, 15-, and 30-micrograms WY-49605 disks. The 5-micrograms disk is recommended, with tentative breakpoints of > or = 16 mm for susceptibility (MIC, < or = 2.0 microgram/ml) and < or = 12 mm for resistance (MIC, > or = 8.0 micrograms/ml).
