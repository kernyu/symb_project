Plasmids specifying bacteriocin production and immunity to its action were found in three clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus obtained in different hospitals located in Rio de Janeiro. These plasmids (pRJ28, pRJ29 and pRJ30) of 8.0 kb were found to generate identical restriction fragment patterns upon digestion with several enzymes, although the range of strains susceptible to the respective bacteriocin varied among the producer strains, when different Gram-positive bacteria were used as indicators, pRJ29 was then chosen for further characterization in order to compare it with pRJ6 and pRJ9, two small bacteriocin-encoding plasmids previously described in strains isolated from food. pRJ29 was found to code for a bacteriocin with chemical properties (sensitivity to proteases, heat resistance, activity under anaerobiosis, and estimated molecular weight) similar to those of pRJ6-encoded bacteriocin, conferring cross-immunity to it. However, its restriction map differed from those of pRJ6 and pRJ9. These studies together with hybridization, incompatibility, and mobilization analyses using a derivative of pRJ29 tagged with Tn917-lac suggest that pRJ29 is a mosaic composed of genetic determinants found on pRJ6 and pRJ9, and that IS257 was not involved in the recombination events which gave rise to pRJ29.
