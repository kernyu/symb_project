Six human pathogenic Trichosporon species are described with respect to criteria for routine identification, epidemiology and clinical origin: T. ovoides, T. inkin, T. asahii, T. asteroides (Fissuricella filamenta), T. cutaneum, and T. mucoides. These species are causative agents of white piedra and cutaneous infections and are involved in systemic, localized or disseminated mycoses, particularly in patients with underlying haematological malignancy. Data on in vitro sensitivity to antifungal drugs are provided.
