The satA gene encoding streptogramin A resistance was detected in virginiamycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium isolates from pigs and broilers. The satA gene was present in 22 of 89 (25%) virginiamycin-resistant E. faecium isolates. It was shown that the satA gene and other gene(s) encoding streptogramin resistance could be transferred between isogenic E. faecium strains at frequencies ranging from 2.3 x 10(-4) to 2.2 x 10(-3) transconjugants per donor.
