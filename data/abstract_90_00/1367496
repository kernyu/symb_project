The penDE gene from Penicillium chrysogenum has been isolated; the gene is located in close vicinity of the pcbC gene. Amplification of the pcbC-penDE gene cluster in Penicillium chrysogenum Wis54-1255 leads to a significant increase in penicillin production. In selected transformants an increase of up to 40% is observed.
