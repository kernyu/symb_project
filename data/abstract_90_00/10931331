In the annotation of genomic sequences, small open reading frames (ORFs) are often neglected, particularly if they have no homology to other ORFs or proteins. A mini-TnphoA insertion in a 602 bp 'intergenic' region of the Escherichia coli chromosome at genomic nucleotide 1702674 gave rise to a membrane-bound PhoA fusion protein and a two- to fourfold increase in the intrinsic susceptibility to a wide spectrum of beta-lactam antibiotics without affecting beta-lactamase activity or susceptibility to tetracycline, chloramphenicol, gentamicin or quinolones. Susceptibility was also increased to cycloserine and bacitracin, but not to fosfomycin or valinomycin; these drugs, like beta-lactams, inhibit peptidoglycan synthesis, although by different mechanisms. A clone bearing only 358 bp of this 'blr' region restored resistance to the parental level. Two amber mutations in the clone prevented such restoration and were counteracted by an amber suppressor, proving that the active species is a protein. The Blr protein has 41 amino acids, with a single predicted transmembrane helix, but no clear homology to any other protein. A transcriptional start exists 39 bp upstream from the translational start. The membrane location of Blr suggests that it may be part of an efflux pump or involved in murein metabolism. The results indicate that genes for other very small functional proteins may lie within 'intergenic' regions.
