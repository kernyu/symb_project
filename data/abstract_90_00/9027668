We compared the sensitivities to antibacterials of Staphylococcus aureus strains isolated from skin infections in two hospitals of different sizes. There were differences between the two hospitals in the proportions of the strains isolated that were resistant to certain drugs, and these differences may be related to the patterns of drug use at each hospital. The differences in the patterns of drug use at each hospital may be due to the types of infections encountered and/or the ages of the patients, both of which differed greatly. The proportions of resistant strains may also be related to differences in the proportions of in-patients.
