A highly efficient method of introducing DNA into an important human pathogen is reported here. Electroporation-mediated transformation of a laboratory-passaged isolate of Helicobacter pylori was successfully used to establish genetic mutants at a transformation frequency of > 10(5)/micrograms DNA. This method should be widely applicable to all isolates of H. pylori and may eliminate the variability reported when natural transformation was used on fresh clinical isolates.
