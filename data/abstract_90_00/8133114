The blood stage antimalarial efficacy of primaquine (0.25 mg of base/kg of body weight/day over 14 days) and chloroquine (25 mg of base/kg over 3 days) were compared in 85 adult Thai men with acute Plasmodium vivax malaria. Most (75%) had at least one malaria episode previously. Parasite clearance times after primaquine alone (n = 30) were slower than after chloroquine (n = 30) or combined chloroquine-primaquine (n = 25), but all patients had a satisfactory initial therapeutic response. P. vivax malaria recurred in 10 (17%) of 60 patients followed for > or = 2 months and Plasmodium falciparum malaria developed in another 5 (8%) without reexposure to infection. Recurrences occurred < or = 5 weeks after primaquine treatment (n = 4), suggesting recrudescence, whereas recurrences after chloroquine treatment (n = 6) occurred > or = 5 weeks later, suggesting relapse. Vivax malaria responds well initially to either primaquine or chloroquine. The blood stage antimalarial activity of primaquine may mask chloroquine resistance in combined regimens.
