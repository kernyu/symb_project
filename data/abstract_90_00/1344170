The present paper describes the relationship of Mean Parasite Clearance Time (MPCT) and Mean Parasite Recrudescence Time (MPRT) in the epidemiology of Plasmodium falciparum. The role of MPCT in grading the resistance of an area has been discussed. Further, MPRT revealed a positive correlationship with the percentage of RI resistant cases, and showed an increase with age. The ratio of MPRT/MPCT is an indicator of stability status of the resistance.
