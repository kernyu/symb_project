This article discusses the use of tetracyclines in the clinical management of periodontal infections. A review of the drugs pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and potential adverse effects shows that they are relatively safe if used in appropriate dosages and under controlled conditions. Current data suggest that the routine use of tetracyclines in conjunction with the treatment of periodontitis is unnecessary. However, their distinctive characteristics can be utilized in different delivery systems as an adjunctive aid to conventional treatment of juvenile and refractory forms of periodontitis.
