Sixty-five sheep farms in the northern provinces of Buenos Aires, Entre Rios, Corrientes, Cordoba and Sante Fe were used in this survey on anthelmintic resistance. Anthelmintic groups tested were the benzimidazoles, levamisole, the combination levamisole + benzimidazole product and the avermectins. The overall level of resistance was 46% of properties, with resistance to the individual drug groups being 40%, 22%, 11% and 6%, respectively. On a large proportion of farms the resistance recorded was to two, or more, anthelmintic groups. Haemonchus contortus, Ostertagia spp. and Trichostrongylus spp. were the most abundant parasite species recorded. Resistance was greatest in the province of Corrientes where the frequency of treatment is generally high due to the endemic nature of H. contortus. Management practices were also important with resistance greatest on farms where frequent drenching is carried out and on farms carrying only sheep.
