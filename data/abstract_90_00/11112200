The purpose of this study was to characterize the relative and combined effects of sterilization, molecular weight, and mixing method on the fracture and fatigue performance of acrylic bone cement. Palacos R brand bone cement powder was sterilized using ethylene oxide gas (EtO) or gamma irradiation. Nonsterile material was used as a control. Molecular weights of the bone-cement powders and cured cements were measured using gel permeation chromatography. Hand and vacuum mixing were employed to mold single edge-notched bend specimens for fracture toughness testing. Molded dog-bone specimens were used for fatigue tests. Electron microscopy was used to study fracture mechanisms. Analysis of variance and Student t-tests were used to compare fracture and fatigue performance between sterilization and mixing groups. Our results indicate that vacuum mixing improved significantly the fracture and fatigue resistance (P<.05, P<.07) over hand mixing in radiation-sterilized and EtO-sterilized groups. In vacuum-mixed cement, the degradation in molecular weight resulting from gamma irradiation decreased fracture resistance significantly when compared with EtO sterilization and control (P<.05). A corresponding decrease in fatigue resistance was observed in the cement that was degraded severely by a radiation dose of 10 MRad (P<.05). In contrast, EtO sterilization did not result in a significantly different fracture resistance when compared with unsterilized controls for vacuum-mixed cement (P>.1). For hand-mixed cement, fracture and fatigue resistance appeared to be independent of sterilization method. This independence is believed to be the result of higher porosity that compromised the mechanical properties and obscures any effect of sterilization. Our results indicate that a combination of nonionizing sterilization and vacuum mixing resulted in the best mechanical performance and is most likely to contribute to enhanced longevity in vivo.
