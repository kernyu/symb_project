One-hundred and two Campylobacter clinical isolates were characterized for their in-vitro resistance to erythromycin (1.9%), three fluoroquinolones (31.3-34.3%), tetracycline (43.1%), kanamycin (4.8%), ampicillin (18.6%) and other 16 antimicrobial agents. Conjugative transfer of tetracycline and kanamycin resistances among these strains was achieved and small plasmids of 4.3, 4 and 1.9 kb were observed in kanamycin-resistant Campylobacter coli strains.
