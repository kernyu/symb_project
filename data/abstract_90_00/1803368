The clinical features of a tuberculous process were studied in 101 patients with active pulmonary tuberculosis among whom 76% of the patients lost their social adaptation. The patients were divided into 2 groups: group 1 comprising 61 (60.4%) subjects who excreted tuberculosis mycobacteria and L-forms and group 2 consisting of 40 (39.6%) who excreted only tuberculosis mycobacteria. The frequency and degree of drug resistance were more manifest in 63.8% of the patients of group 1 and in 40% of those of group 2 (p less than 0.01). Drug resistance to relatively new antituberculosis drugs (ethambutol and rifampicin) was found in 30% of the patients. Mixed bacillary population was found 2 times more frequently in patients with serious progressive forms of tuberculosis, which gives evidence to consider it as a prognostically unfavourable indicator.
