A strain of Haemonchus contortus resistant to the benzimidazoles, ivermectin and salicylanilides was used to study the effect of exposure to ivermectin or oxfendazole on the number of eggs produced by adult female parasites. After anthelmintic administration there was a reduction in the faecal egg count of the infected lambs. Ivermectin caused a reduction in the number of eggs within adult parasites for up to 72 hours but this returned to higher than pre-treatment levels at 168 hours after treatment. After oxfendazole treatment there was an increase in the number of eggs stored in the adult parasites at 24 hours and then a significant reduction in the number of eggs for over 168 hours. This suggested that both ivermectin and oxfendazole have a deleterious effect on the reproductive potential of female H contortus although the parasites are resistant to these drugs. These results confirm the importance of allowing up to 10 days to elapse between the time of administration of an anthelmintic and the collecting of faecal samples when using the faecal egg count reduction test to identify anthelmintic resistance, especially when using benzimidazoles. The more prolonged effect on fecundity produced by oxfendazole may reflect the antimitotic action of the benzimidazole anthelmintics.
