Enterococci are occurring in opportunistic infections involving the oral cavity. This study has identified enterococcal species in 29 endodontic infections undergoing treatment with Ca (OH)2 dressings. The in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility of 29 isolated enterococcal strains was determined. Enterococcus faecalis was speciated for 26 isolates and Enterococcus faecium for three isolates. In vitro antimicrobial susceptibility testing revealed enterococcal isolates resistant to benzylpenicillin, ampicillin, clindamycin, metronidazole and tetracycline but sensitive to erythromycin and vancomycin. Due to low sensitivity to antimicrobial agents, enterococci may be selected in root canals undergoing standard endodontic treatment and significantly contribute to endodontic treatment failures.
