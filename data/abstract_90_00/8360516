From January to December 1991, 47 clinical cases in when methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains were isolate were investigated at our internal medicine ward. The MRSA infection rate was 57.4% (27/47). The mortality due to MRSA bacteremia was 75.0% (9/12) and that due to MRSA pneumonia was 57.1% (4/7). We think that MRSA infections must be treated by multiple antibiotics. At out institution, most of the patients were given a combination therapy of imipenem + fosfomycin or imipenemt + mynocycline. Although in vitro the MICs of imipenem did not show excellent activity against MRSA strains, in vivo these combination therapy including imipenem showed excellent activity against MRSA infections. We think that this result was due to the additive effect of the two drug combination. We determined the MICs of single antibiotics against MRSA strains. Most of the MRSA strains were sensitive to minocycline and arbekacin. All MRSA strains were sensitive to vancomycin we think that vancomycin is a highly useful drug to combat MRSA infection.
