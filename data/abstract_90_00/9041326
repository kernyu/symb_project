Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) drug susceptibility testing is often curtailed because such testing is expensive and time consuming. A colorimetric tetrazolium dye method previously used for high-throughput antiviral drug screening was adapted to assess the susceptibility of 16 HIV-1 isolates to zidovudine, didanosine, lamivudine, and nevirapine in MT-2 cells. Cell viability was assessed colorimetrically, and all measurements and calculations were automated. Each HIV-1 isolate was tested in > or = 5 assays to determine the reproducibility of the assay in HIV-1 isolates with known reverse-transcriptase mutations. The drug susceptibility of several mutant HIV-1 strains whose drug susceptibilities had not previously been well defined was also determined. Data on HIV-1 replication from the susceptibility assays indicated that some mutant HIV-1 isolates may have been less cytopathic in MT-2 cells than wild type HIV-1 isolates.
