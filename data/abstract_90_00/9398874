BACKGROUND: Given the therapeutic potential of proton pump inhibitor-based triple therapy for successful cure of Helicobacter pylori infection, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of lansoprazole with clarithromycin and amoxicillin in an open-label, single-center study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: H. pylori-positive patients self-administered lansoprazole, 30 mg; clarithromycin, 500 mg; and amoxicillin, 1 gm bid for 14 days. Patients were assessed pretreatment, at which time the presence of H. pylori was documented by rapid urease test, culture, or histology, following study drug administration (week 2) for a brief evaluation only, and at least 4 weeks posttreatment (week 6), which included endoscopy with collection of biopsy specimens for culture and histology testing. RESULTS: Primary clarithromycin and metronidazole resistance were observed in 6% (2 of 30) and 43% (13 of 30) of study patients, respectively. One month after the end of therapy, H. pylori infection was cured in 23 of 25 patients (92%; 95% confidence interval, 74%-99%). The triple-therapy regimen was well-tolerated; 17% of patients (5 of 30) reported mild to moderate adverse effects during the treatment period. CONCLUSION: A 2-week, triple-drug combination of lansoprazole, clarithoromycin, and amoxicillin is highly effective for cure of H. pylori infection. Additionally, the triple-drug combination was well-tolerated by patients infected with H. pylori.
