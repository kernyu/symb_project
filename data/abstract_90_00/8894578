The in vitro activity of the fluoroquinolone trovafloxacin (CP-99,219) against 257 blood isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae obtained from Swedish hospitals was compared with those of commonly prescribed oral antibiotics and also with those of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin against a collection of strains resistant (n = 6) or intermediately resistant (n = 22) to penicillin (Pc-R). The MICs of trovafloxacin for Pc-R strains of pneumococci ranged from 0.032 to 0.25 mg/l. No difference was seen between the clinical isolates and the Pc-R strains (MIC50 = 0.064 mg/l and MIC90 = 0.125 mg/l for both collections). For the Pc-R strains, the MIC50 and MIC90 values of ciprofloxacin were 0.5 and 1 mg/l, and those of ofloxacin 2 and 4 mg/l. The incidence of resistance in the two collections (clinical isolates/Pc-R strains) was 3%/39% for tetracycline, 1%/18% for macrolides, and 3%/57% for trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. The results of the current study suggest that the clinical efficacy of trovafloxacin in the treatment of pneumococcal infections should be investigated.
