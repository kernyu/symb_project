The human intestinal cell line, Caco-2, and the Ca2+ ionophores, A23187 and ionomycin, were used to determine the interrelationships of 45Ca(2+) efflux, transepithelial electrical resistance (Rt), and [3H]-mannitol flux to changes in 51Cr release and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity. Treatment of Caco-2 monolayers with ionomycin at concentrations of between 0.25 and 2.50 mumol/l showed similar 45Ca(2+) efflux rate constants and coefficients. Analysis of the control and ionomycin-induced 45Ca(2+) efflux values showed the data to best fit a three Ca(2+) compartmental model. All changes in Caco-2 Rt and [3H]-mannitol flux were reversible with no significant increases in 51Cr release with ionomycin concentrations of less than or equal to 2.5 mumols/l. Caco-2 monolayers treated with ionomycin at concentrations of between 5.0 and 50.0 mumols/l showed rapid non-exponential 45Ca(2+) effluxes with irreversible changes in Rt, [3H]-mannitol flux, and significant increases in 51Cr release. There was no changes in media LDH activity using either ionomycin or A23187 at concentrations of up to 50 mumols/l for 60 min. The results of our study show that: (1) disruption of Ca(2+) homeostasis in Caco-2 cells will occur with the addition of Ca(2+) ionophores at concentrations of greater than 2.50 mumols/l; (2) high concentrations (greater than 2.5 mumols/l) of ionomycin will cause non-exponential 45Ca(2+) efflux rates with irreversible changes in intracellular Rt and 14C-mannitol flux, and (3) early signs of Ca(2+) ionophore-induced damage can be detected by 51Cr release from Caco-2 cells into the media and not by changes in LDH media activity.
