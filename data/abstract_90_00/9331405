The heavy use of antibiotics over recent decades has resulted in widespread resistance of bacteria to many drugs. Overcoming resistance requires new approaches to antibiotic development, including the exploitation of new targets in the bacterial cell. Protein secretion is essential for bacterial cell growth and virulence, so it could be a suitable target for new therapeutic agents.
