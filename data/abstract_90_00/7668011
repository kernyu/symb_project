Malaria chemoprophylaxis does not rely on causal aspects but is based on suppression of clinical symptoms after infection has taken place. Chloroquine remains the standard for infection against the "benign" forms of malaria. Due to the widespread chloroquine-resistance of Plasmodium falciparum a chemoprophylaxis will consist of mefloquine or chloroquine combined with proguanil. The decision to take a chemoprophylaxis is based on the knowledge of risk of malaria transmission, effectiveness and side effects of the drugs, and compliance of the traveller. Emergency self-treatment may be helpful in various situations.
