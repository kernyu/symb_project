Yeast strains disrupted in the PDR1, PDR3, or PDR5 gene, but not in SNQ2, exhibited higher sensitivity to mucidin (strobilurin A) than did the isogenic wild-type strains. Different gain-of-function mutations in the PDR1 and PDR3 genes rendered yeast mutants resistant to this antibiotic. Mucidin induced PDR5 expression, but the changes in the expression of SNQ2 were only barely detectable. The results indicate that PDR5 provides the link between transcriptional regulation by PDR1 and PDR3 and mucidin resistance of yeast.
