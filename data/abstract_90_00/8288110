Saccharomyces cerevisiae genes encoding functions necessary for inhibition by the Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae cyclic lipodepsipeptide, syringomycin-E, were identified by mutant analyses. Syringomycin-E-resistant mutants were isolated, shown to contain single recessive mutations, and divided into eight gene complementation groups. Representative strains from five groups were resistant to nystatin, and deficient in the plasma membrane lipid, ergosterol. All of the mutant strains were resistant to the related cyclic lipodepsipeptides, syringotoxin and syringostatin. The findings show that: 1) at least eight gene-encoded functions participate in the inhibitory response to syringomycin; 2) ergosterol is important for this response; 3) the three related lipodepsipeptides have similar modes of action.
