Twenty-five high-level gentamicin resistant (HLGR) Enterococcus faecalis strains were isolated from three different University laboratories in Italy. The resistant strains were variously distributed in the three centers with percentages of prevalence ranging from about 3% up to 14%. Almost all strains shared high-level resistance to streptomycin (23 out of 25). Ribotyping and restriction analysis of the 16S-23S rRNA intergenic spacer sequences were used to genetically differentiate the various strains and to study their spreading in the university hospitals serviced by the three laboratories. At least three ribotypes were identified, which showed a peculiar distribution in the various centers. Only the ribotype B was isolated from the University of Padua. In Cagliari, most strains belonged to ribotype A (4/6), whereas in Genoa there was an equal distribution of the ribotypes A and B. A clonal spreading of some HLGR strains is suggested by these findings. The restriction analysis of the 16S-23S rRNA intergenic-spacer sequences gave comparable results with classical ribotyping and, in addition, was quicker and easier to perform than the latter.
