The oral administration of the therapeutic doses of tetracycline, pefloxacin, ampicillin, cephalexin, rifampicin, sisomicin to Wistar rats for 5 days was accompanied by a decrease in the total number of lactobacilli in feces and by changes of the species spectre of these microorganisms. In those rats species, never found in intact animals, could be revealed rather frequently. All antimicrobial preparations administered in this investigation induced a decrease in the proportion of antibiotic-sensitive cultures and led to the selection of strains having multiresistance and increased antagonistic activity with respect to Pseudomonas indicator strain. The possible relationship between the markers antibiotic resistance and antagonistic activity in lactobacilli is discussed.
