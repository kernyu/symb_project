Pseudomonas aeruginosa has been a major bacterial partner when MRSA (Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) is isolated clinically. Hence, we studied the in vitro combined effect of fosfomycin (FOM) plus sulbactam/cefoperazone (SBT/CPZ) against mixed infections of MRSA and P. aeruginosa. The combined effect of FOM plus SBT/CPZ was observed through an FIC index using the checkerboard method, log reduction of colony counts on the time killing curve, and morphological changes observed using scanning electron micrography. Under serum concentration at 3 hours after administration in consider of pharmacokinetics, the combination effect was also evaluated. Furthermore, we evaluated a time-lag combination therapy in which FOM is administered 60 minutes before SBT/CPZ administration for mixed infections. Synergistic effects of FOM plus SBT/CPZ were clearly observed against mixed infections of MRSA and P. aeruginosa. Log reduction of colony counts on the time killing curve seemed to be an appropriate indicator in the evaluation of synergistic effects.
