The properties of ofloxacin such as a new mechanism of action, broad spectrum and high antimicrobial activity, 100-percent bioavailability and rapid penetration to the body tissues, etc. which defined the antibiotic high efficacy in the therapy of infections difficult for the treatment with other antibacterial drugs are presented. The intensive use of ofloxacin within the last years was no accompanied by an increase in the resistance of the main pathogens to it. High concentrations of ofloxacin provided in the nasa sinuses and the antibiotic broad spectrum including the majority of gram-positive and gram-negative microbes conditioned its high therapeutic efficacy in the treatment of chronic sinusitis and otitis. Successful treatment of tuberculosis resistant of other drugs with ofloxacin supplementing the standard 3-component combination of rifampicin, isoniazid and pyrazinamide was shown possible. By its bioavailability ofloxacin proved to be superior to ciprofloxacin and its oral dose of 200 mg was equivalent by the efficacy to the oral dose of 500 mg of ciprofloxacin. The usual regimen of the ofloxacin use in the treatment of severe infections was 400 mg intravenously twice a day. The further oral use in a dose of 400 mg once a day was possible after the infectious process stabilization.
