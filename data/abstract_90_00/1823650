Composition of sterol fractions of nystatin-resistant Candida maltosa strains was determined. Using UV-spectrometry, TLC and GLC-MS it was demonstrated that resistance to nystatin is connected with the composition alterations of yeast cell sterols. Block of different stages of ergosterol biosynthesis was revealed in some mutants, viz. C-24-transmethylation, delta 8----delta 7-isomerization, 14 alpha-demethylation, C-5(6)-dehydrogenation, reduction of C-14(15) and C-24(28) double bonds.
