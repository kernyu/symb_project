Resistance to interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) in the 38C13 B-lymphoma cell line results in the loss of antiviral, antiproliferative, and immune regulatory functions of IFN-alpha. Mutagenesis with ethylmethylsulfonic acid (EMS), which can induce point mutations in DNA, increases the frequency of resistance to IFN-alpha 20 to 40-fold. In contrast, treatment with 5-azacytidine, which causes hypomethylation of DNA, reduces the frequency of resistance to 5-10% of control. Furthermore, 5-azacytidine treatment reverts IFN-alpha-resistant cells to the IFN-alpha-sensitive state. Resistance to IFN-alpha occurs spontaneously at a rate of approximately 3 x 10(-6) variants/cell.generation, and is stable for more than 30 passages without selection in IFN-alpha. There is no evidence that gene amplification contributes to the high rate of resistance to IFN-alpha in these cells. These results indicate that DNA mutation and methylation are important in the development of IFN-alpha resistance in these cells.
