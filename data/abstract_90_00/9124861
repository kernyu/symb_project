The observation that human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) mutations conferring resistance to one reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitor may suppress resistance to other RT inhibitors provides a rationale for treating HIV-1 with certain RT inhibitor combinations. We examined phenotypic and genotypic changes during culture of a multinucleoside (zidovudine, didanosine, zalcitibine, and stavudine)-resistant HIV-1 strain with and without additional RT inhibitors (nevirapine and lamivudine). The development of nevirapine or lamivudine resistance by the multinucleoside-resistant strain was not accompanied by a reduction in zidovudine or didanosine resistance.
