A clinical isolate of Pseudomonas aeruginosa resistant to pefloxacin (Pef) but susceptible to ciprofloxacin (Cip) was studied to compare the in vitro and in vivo activities of Pef, ofloxacin (Ofl), and Cip. The time-kill curve method showed no bactericidal activity for Pef and Ofl, but a reduction of 4 log10 CFU/ml was achieved with Cip at 1 h. A model of experimental P. aeruginosa pneumonia was used to evaluate in vivo the relevance of the difference in susceptibility observed in vitro. At 36 h, a 100% cumulative survival rate was observed in Cip-treated rats, which was far higher than the survival rate obtained with Pef (53%) or Ofl (46%) (P < 0.001). At 4 h, no bacteremia was observed in Cip-treated rats, whereas 93% of the Pef-treated rats and 80% of the Ofl-treated rats were bacteremic (P < 0.001). The best pulmonary bacterial clearance was observed with Cip. Interestingly, Pef and Ofl, to which the strain was resistant in vitro, showed a fairly good in vivo activity despite sub-MIC concentrations. Cip was more effective than Pef and Ofl in terms of pulmonary and systemic bactericidal activity and provided the best survival rate in animals. We conclude that differences between the different quinolones in terms of the organism's sensitivity assessed in vitro may be relevant and that it might be useful to reconsider the use of a quinolone to which P. aeruginosa shows resistance if the organism shows sensitivity to no other agent.
