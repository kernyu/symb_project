The activity of a new water-soluble pneumocandin, L-733,560, was evaluated with 107 pathogenic strains of Candida and Torulopsis, which included 23 strains with known multi-azole resistance patterns. In vitro evaluation of L-733,560 activity was performed by a broth microdilution method, and the activity was compared with the activities of amphotericin B, fluconazole, ketoconazole, itraconazole, and flucytosine. The mean MICs of L-733,560 were 0.15 microgram/ml for C. lusitaniae, 0.72 microgram/ml for C. parapsilosis, 0.78 micrograms/ml for C. krusei, and 1.25 micrograms/ml for C. guilliermondii. The results indicate that the new antifungal agent L-733,560 demonstrated the best activity with the lowest MICs against C. albicans, T. glabrata, C. tropicalis, and C. kefyr, less activity against C. krusei, C. lusitaniae, and C. parapsilosis, and the least activity against C. guilliermondii. L-733,560 also demonstrated good activity against the various multi-azole-resistant Candida and T. glabrata isolates.
