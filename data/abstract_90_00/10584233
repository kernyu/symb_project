Nevirapine (NVP) is a potent noncompetitive inhibitor of the reverse transcriptase enzyme, which is necessary for HIV replication. NVP selectively inhibits HIV-1 but not HIV-2 and any of the human DNA polymerases. NVP is active against ZDV-resistant HIV-1 and synergistic with nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. NVP has a favorable pharmacokinetic profile, becomes widely distributed throughout body tissues including the central nervous system, and is active in the adult at an oral dose of 200 mg administered twice daily after a 2 week lead-in dose of 200 mg/day due to its long elimination half life. Although the currently used protease inhibitors (PIs) may undergo more rapid rates of metabolism because NVP induces CYP3A, No dosage adjustments are required when NVP is taken in combination with PIs so far. When administered in triple combinations with antiretroviral agents, the antiviral effect of NVP has been profound and sustained in HIV-infected patients, particularly in naive patients to antiretroviral therapy. Resistance to NVP is rapid when given as monotherapy, but this is altered and made less clinically relevant when NVP is administered as a triple combination. NVP has a safety profile that does not overlap with other antiretroviral therapies, the most common treatment-limiting reaction being rash. It seems that NVP would be a very useful option in combination with antiretroviral agents.
