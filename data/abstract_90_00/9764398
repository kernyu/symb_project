Cefditoren (formerly ME-1206), a new orally administered cephalosporin, was evaluated in vitro against 1249 recently isolated strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae (500 strains), Moraxella catarrhalis (250 strains), and Haemophilus influenzae (499 strains). Reference National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards methods were used and the strains were representative for the current rates of beta-lactamase production or penicillin resistance. Cefditoren had MIC50/MIC90 results for Moraxella catarrhalis and Haemophilus influenzae of 0.12/0.5 and < or = 0.008/0.015 microgram/mL, respectively. The pneumococci were consistently twofold to eightfold more susceptible to cefditoren than other oral cephalosporins or penicillins. The MIC90 for penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae was only 2 micrograms cefditoren/mL, and the highest recorded MIC was 4 micrograms/mL. Cefditoren appears to be a very promising beta-lactam possessing the greatest potency and potential spectrum versus contemporary (1997) respiratory tract pathogens.
