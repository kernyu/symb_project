The anti-larval IgE antibody response of adolescents with high or low resistance to infection by Schistosoma mansoni was evaluated before parasitological cure with oxamniquine and over an extended post-treatment period during which the least resistant subjects regained high infections. IgE from most sera, taken at several bleeding times before and after treatment, reacted, on immunoblots, with a large number of antigens (Ag) in schistosomular tegument extract. A family of 120-165-kDa cross-reacting molecules and a 85-kDa Ag were the most prominent Ag. Some of these determinants were shown to be located on the outer tegumental membrane and to be accessible to IgE on living larvae. The comparison of IgE between the two study groups showed that IgE levels were on average six-to eightfold higher (p less than 0.01) in the sera of the most resistant adolescents whereas there was no difference in patterns of Ag recognition between study groups. In contrast to IgE, anti-larval IgG and IgM levels were either similar in both groups or higher in the least resistant subjects when these exhibited high reinfection levels. IgG that competed for the binding of IgE to larval Ag were detected in most sera and their levels were higher in the least resistant group after reinfection. Finally, the treatment had no observable long-lasting effects on the levels and on the specificity of the anti-larval IgE. Altogether, these observations can be taken as evidence supporting a role of IgE in human resistance to infection by S. mansoni.
