Prior to the general availability of Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine in the Republic of Ireland, a two-year study of the epidemiology of invasive Haemophilus influenzae disease was carried out. Of 137 invasive strains of Haemophilus influenzae examined in a central laboratory, 94.2% were serotype b and 90.5% were biotype I. Seventeen percent of serotype b strains produced beta-lactamase, and 2.3% were resistant to both ampicillin and chloramphenicol. The majority of serotype b strains were electrophoretic types of the electrophoretic 12 clone family, principally 12.5. Meningitis was the most common infection caused by serotype b. The study data extend the current knowledge of strains of Haemophilus influenzae causing invasive disease in the Republic of Ireland.
