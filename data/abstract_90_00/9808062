The smoke-induced airway hyperresponsiveness (SIAHR) to inhaled wood smoke was investigated in anesthetized guinea pigs. Two smoke challenges (each 10 ml) separated by 30 min were delivered into the lungs by a respirator. In control animals, SIAHR was evidenced by an average bronchoconstrictive response (an increase in total lung resistance) to the second smoke challenge (SM2) that was approximately 4.3-fold greater than that to the first challenge (SM1). Pretreatment with CP-96,345 and SR-48,968 (neurokinin-1 and -2 receptor antagonists; each 1 mg/kg) in combination totally prevented this SIAHR, while pretreatment with CP-96,344 and SR48,965 (inactive enantiomers of CP-96,345 and SR-48,968, each 1 mg/kg) in combination failed to do so. Pretreatment with CP-96,345 (1 mg/kg), SR48,968 (1 mg/kg), or atropine (50 microg/kg) significantly alleviated this SIAHR. Pretreatment with phosphoramidon [an inhibitor of neutral endopeptidase (NEP); 2 mg/kg], which suppresses the degradation of tachykinins, induced an increase in airway reactivity that largely mimicked this SIAHR. The NEP activity measured in airway tissues excised 30 min after SM1 was significantly lower than that in air control value. These results suggest that 1) a prior wood smoke exposure induces an airway hyperresponsiveness to the subsequent wood smoke inhalation, 2) a tachykininergic mechanism involving both neurokinin-1 and -2 receptors is essential for, and a cholinergic mechanism is also involved in the development of this SIAHR, and 3) inactivation of airway NEP by wood smoke may contribute to this SIAHR.
