The clinical tolerance of and the effects recombinant human interferon-beta (rHuIFN-beta) obtained from mammalian cells (Chinese hamster ovary cells) exerts on 2',5'-oligoadenyl (2-5A) synthetase activity, human-Mx protein, neopterin, beta 2-microglobulin, interleukin-1 (IL-1) alpha and beta synthesis were compared to those of natural IFN-beta in 12 healthy volunteers. Each subject received a single i.m. injection of 6 x 10(6) IU rHuIFN-beta and natural IFN-beta according to a randomized double-blind cross-over study design. Both were well tolerated and provoked similar changes in clinical indices. Moreover, rHuIFN-beta and natural IFN-beta induced significant and similar increases in 2'-5' adenylates, human Mx protein, and neopterin levels, but neither modulated beta 2-microglobulin, IL-1 alpha or beta synthesis. The sum of these findings indicates that rHuIFN-beta and natural IFN-beta are biologically equivalent. In view of these results, we are of the opinion that these two types of IFN are probably also therapeutically equivalent and, in consequence, that trials to evaluate the response of viral and neoplastic disease patients to rHuIFN-beta are fully justified.
