Three groups of patients suffering from diabetes mellitus with secondary sulfanilamide resistance (SS) were observed. The first group was given sugar-lowering drugs since the disease was diagnosed, the second group -- insulin plus hypoglycemic drugs, the third group -- insulin injections. The patients were followed up for 6-10 years, from the time of SS development -- 4.6 years. Stable compensation of diabetes mellitus was better achieved with combined therapy including sugar-lowering drugs per os and insulin, a dose of insulin being less by 22 units than in patients on insulin only. Progression of diabetic angiopathies was also less noticeable in the second group on combined therapy. The most unfavorable course of diabetic angiopathies and their progression were observed in the first group on sugar-lowering drugs per os.
