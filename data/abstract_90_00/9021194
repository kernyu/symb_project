IRT-14 (TEM-45) is a new mutant TEM-type beta-lactamase that was isolated from clinical Escherichia coli P37 and that confers resistance to broad-spectrum penicillins with reduced sensitivity to beta-lactamase inhibitors. The MICs of amoxicillin alone and of amoxicillin combined with 2 micrograms of clavulanic acid or 2 micrograms of tazobactam per ml were 4,096, 2,048, and 1,024 micrograms/ml, respectively. The strain was susceptible to cephalosporins, aztreonam, moxalactam, and imipenem. The enzyme was purified to homogeneity, and values of the kinetic parameters Kcat, Km, and Kcat/Km were determined for different substrates. This enzyme, with a pI of 5.2, was found to have reduced affinity for broad-spectrum penicillins and cephalosporins. The values of 50% inhibitory concentrations of clavulanic acid, sulbactam, tazobactam, and brobactam are correlated with the higher KmS for substrates. The resistance of E. coli P37 to mechanism-based inactivators results from a higher level of production of the TEM-derived enzyme due to the G-to-T substitution at position 162 (G-162-->T) in the promoter region of blaTEM and from the structural modifications resulting from the Met-69-->Leu and Arg-275-->Gln substitutions that characterize IRT-14 beta-lactamase.
