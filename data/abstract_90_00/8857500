Hemodynamics effects of ethanol were studied in young adults at specific predetermined ethanol levels of 0.025%, 0.05%, and 0.75%. Findings included a decrease in end-systolic wall stress (afterload) and myocardial contractility following ingestion of ethanol at concentrations found in "social drinking."
