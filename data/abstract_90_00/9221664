The study revealed the possibility, on principle, for L. acidophilus strain VKM V-2020 D to colonize the intestine of white mice with the preservation of the viability of lactobacilli subjected to the action of antibiotics. The culture of this strain, isolated from the animals, showed the stability of its biological properties: resistance to polymyxin M, kanamycin, cyprofloxacin, nalidixic acid (including acquired resistance to rifampicin), as well as pronounced antagonism with respect to Vibrio cholerae. Good prospects for the use of L. acidophilus strain VKM V-2020 D for further studies regarding its use for prophylaxis and therapy were noted.
