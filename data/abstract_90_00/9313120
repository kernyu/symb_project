One hundred and seventy-seven bacterial isolates obtained from pediatric burn victims were tested for in vitro susceptibility against bacitracin, silver sulfadiazine, mafenide acetate, nitrofurazone, and mupirocin by two methods: standard microbroth dilution and Nathan's agar well diffusion (NAWD). Nitrofurazone had the broadest spectrum of activity. Mupirocin was the most potent agent against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus. Silver sulfadiazine showed activity against gram-positive organisms and higher minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values, and smaller zone sizes were seen for methicillin-resistant S. aureus and gram-negative bacilli. Bacitracin showed activity against S. aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes by the microbroth method; activity could not be assessed by NAWD. Mafenide acetate had the highest MICs for all isolates tested. Correlation between methods for all isolates tested was best for mupirocin and nitrofurazone. NAWD was labor intensive and difficult to interpret; MIC method was easy to perform and reproducible. Clinical correlation is necessary to establish breakpoints for interpretation of test results.
