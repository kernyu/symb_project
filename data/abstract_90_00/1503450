The VanA ligase encoded by the vancomycin resistance plasmid pIP816 of Enterococcus faecium BM4147 condenses D-alanine with various D-2-hydroxy and D-2-amino acids in vitro. D-Lactate added to the culture medium restored the vancomycin resistance of a strain that does not produce the VanH dehydrogenase and therefore appears to be a substrate of VanA in vivo.
