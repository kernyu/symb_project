No treatment was established for disseminated M. avium intracellulare (MAC) infection, a common disease of end stage of AIDS. An open study was conducted to assess in 173 AIDS patients, the activity of clarithromycin. Initial bacteriologic eradication from blood was observed in 136/147 evaluable patients (93%). Acquired resistance to clarithromycin associated with relapse appeared to develop after 2 to 7 months of drug treatment in 31/136 patients with initial success. Early bacteriological relapse was associated with clinical deterioration. Side effects of drug treatment were elevated liver enzymes (26%) and impaired hearing (4%). Side effects conducted to stop treatment in 14 cases (8%) to modified treatment in 8 cases (5%). Our study gave new argues for activity of clarithromycin in disseminated MAC infection.
