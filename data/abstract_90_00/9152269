Antibiotic resistance of Streptococcus pneumoniae is on the rise in many parts of the world, and varies widely across the United States. This is of growing concern as organisms become resistant to cephalosporins and macrolides as well as to beta-lactam antibiotics. Susceptibility testing has become a critical element in antibiotic selection. In vitro susceptibility, however, may not correlate with clinical susceptibility. For example, penicillin G in appropriate doses is often effective therapy for drug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae pneumonia. This report takes into account in vitro susceptibility as well as the patient's coexisting morbidities in the treatment of penicillin-resistant S pneumoniae with penicillin G.
