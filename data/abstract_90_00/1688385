A recombinant bovine leukemia virus (BLV) was constructed in which the X region was replaced with the bacterial neomycin resistance gene controlled by the simian virus 40 early promoter. This virus, termed BLV-SVNEO, is a self-packaging, activator-dependent retroviral vector. Introduction of the plasmid pBLV-SVNEO into mammalian cells resulted in constitutive expression of the neo gene, whereas the BLV structural genes, gag, pol, and env, were expressed only in the presence of the two regulatory proteins, Tax and Rex. The production and release of recombinant virus by cells transfected with pBLV-SVNEO were proportional to the number of G418-resistant colonies that developed after susceptible cells were exposed to the filtered culture medium. BLV-SVNEO was able to infect cell lines of human, bovine, canine, feline, and murine origin. BLV-producing cell lines were resistant to superinfection with BLV-SVNEO. This cell-virus system should facilitate molecular genetic studies of BLV and will provide a rapid, quantitative measure of BLV infectivity in a variety of cell types. These studies also demonstrate the feasibility of using activator-dependent retroviral vectors such as BLV-SVNEO to deliver foreign genes into cells and eventually animals.
