Despite being a treatable and preventable disease, tuberculosis will kill an estimated 30 million people during the current decade. Tuberculosis is a global problem, and increases in case rates are occurring not only in the developing countries of the world but also in several industrialized nations, such as the United States. Coincident with the resurgence of tuberculosis in the United States, there has also been an alarming increase in the number and proportion of cases caused by strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis that are resistant to multiple first-line drugs. The increase in multiple-drug resistant tuberculosis has re-taught physicians about the importance of pursuing and ensuring treatment until cure. The HIV epidemic is playing a pivotal and permissive role in the resurgence of tuberculosis morbidity and mortality in those populations where tuberculosis and HIV are prevalent and overlap. Co-infection with HIV distorts the natural history and clinical expression of tuberculosis. Molecular biology has yielded important insights into the mechanisms of drug resistance and provided powerful tools for the rapid diagnosis and epidemiologic study of this disease.
