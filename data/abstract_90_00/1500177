A murine model of intracerebral (i.c.) infection with Cryptococcus neoformans in which naive mice receiving an i.c. fungal inoculation developed a severe disease has been established. The effect was strictly dependent on the number of microorganisms injected and evolved as lethal meningoencephalitis. Murine susceptibility to i.c. infection with C. neoformans was enhanced by treatment with chloroquine and colchicine, agents known to greatly affect the host phagocytic compartment. Furthermore, the life spans of both naive and drug-treated mice were significantly augmented when opsonized fungi were injected. Therefore, phagocyte-mediated mechanisms are likely involved in local resistance to i.c. infection with C. neoformans. Further support for this conclusion was supplied by in vitro data showing that microglial cells were proficient anticryptococcal effectors, provided opsonized microorganisms were used.
