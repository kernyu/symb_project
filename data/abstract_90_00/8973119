Three frequently used strains of Bacillus were tested using antimicrobial susceptibility test discs to determine their resistance to various antimicrobial drug agents. The organisms selected were B. subtilis ATCC 6633 (used for USP B and F tests), B. stearothermophilus ATCC 12980 (used as a biological indicator for steam sterilization) and B. coagulans ATCC 51232 (used as a biological indicator for steam sterilization). The results indicated that for the thirty antimicrobial drug agents tested, the only organisms which exhibited any resistance to these agents was B. subtilis, and it only showed resistance to two drugs (Aztreonam and Bacitracin).
