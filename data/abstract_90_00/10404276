Twelve Romney lambs and 10 Angora goats were infected with 7000 infective third-stage larvae (89% Trichostrongylus, 11% Ostertagia) collected from goats suspected of harbouring ivermectin-resistant nematodes. On 28 days p.i., the lambs and goats were divided into treatment and control groups of six and five animals, respectively. The animals in the treatment groups were treated with ivermectin (0.2 mg/kg) and necropsied 35 days p.i. Faecal egg counts were estimated on days 28 and 35 p.i. and larval development assays (LDAs) were conducted on 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 34 and 35 days p.i. The ivermectin treatment reduced Trichostronglus colubriformis burdens by 39% and 13% and Ostertagia circumcincta by 33% and 0% in lambs and goats, respectively. When compared with a susceptible strain, the LDAs indicated a resistance factor before treatment in lambs for T. colubriformis of 2.6 and 1.5 with ivermectin and avermectin B2, respectively, which rose to 3.4 and 2.0 after treatment. The LD50 values of the two control groups were relatively constant throughout the experiment. Prior to ivermectin treatment the LD50 values of the treated groups were similar (P > 0.05) to the control groups but following ivermectin treatment their LD50 values increased steadily until the animals were killed on 35 days p.i. The LD50 values for ivermectin and avermectin B2 of sheep were always slightly higher and significantly different (P < 0.01) than those of goats indicating a host effect on this parameter. The greater reduction in worm counts in goats suggests a difference in the efficacy of ivermectin between lambs and goats. This is the first confirmed report of ivermectin resistance in a field strain of T. colubriformis.
