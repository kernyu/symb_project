The efficacy of gentian violet (Gv) in eradicating methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in decubitus ulcers was investigated. Decubitus ulcers (a total of 18 cases) were scrubbed with Gv aqueous solution 0.1% and ointment containing Gv 0.1% was applied daily. MRSA was not detected in these lesions for 3-34 days (average, 10.5 +/- 2.5 days) after the application of Gv ointment. Before this trial, all patients were treated with povidone-iodine and antibiotics; however, those treatments were not effective in eradicating MRSA from skin lesions. Skin irritation and other systemic side effects caused by Gv were not observed. Our data suggest that Gv is a useful agent for treatment of the decubitus ulcers infected with MRSA.
