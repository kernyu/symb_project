We studied the expression in Pseudomonas aeruginosa of an erythromycin-resistance (EMr) determinant that included the mphA gene for macrolide 2'-phosphotransferase I and originated in Escherichia coli. A recombinant plasmid, pTZ3609, that consisted of the EMr determinant and a broad-host-range vector RSF1010, endowed P. aeruginosa with high-level resistance to erythromycin. Furthermore, the EMr determinant on a self-transferable plasmid, RP1, was transferred from E. coli to P. aeruginosa by conjugation.
