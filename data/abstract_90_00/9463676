As chemoresistance of Plasmodium falciparum to chloroquine has arisen, new ways of combating the infection are needed. Similarities exist between the multidrug resistance of mammalian cells and chloroquine resistance of P. falciparum, based on the occurrence of internucleosomal deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) breakdown and the ability of some anticancer drugs and chloroquine to induce apoptosis. Using chloroquine, oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation was observed with a sensitive strain of P. falciparum, but not with a resistant one. This suggests that apoptosis may be involved in the action of chloroquine on the parasite.
