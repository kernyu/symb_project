This study involved the administration of amonafide intravenously 300 mg/m2 daily times five days every three weeks to 16 refractory and relapsed myeloma patients. Doses were escalated to toxicity. These doses caused severe thrombocytopenia and granulocytopenia in seven patients. No responses were seen in this heavily pretreated group of patients.
