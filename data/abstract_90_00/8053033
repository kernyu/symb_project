In order to combat increasing problems with drug resistance in Plasmodium falciparum, Viet Nam has turned increasingly to the artemisinin derivatives. Oral and suppository formulations of artemisinin are produced from locally grown plants. These compounds have been rapidly effective in a large number of studies and have proved of particular value in severe malaria. Artemisinin suppositories are as effective as the parenteral drugs and offer the prospect of a simple, safe and inexpensive method of treating severe malaria in rural areas.
