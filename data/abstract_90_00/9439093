Fourteen strains of Shigella spp. were isolated from patients aged 5-12 yr, hospitalized with dysentery during 1995-1996. The strains isolated were Shigella dysenteriae 1, S. flexneri and S.sonnei. All but one of the 14 strains were sensitive to ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin. The MIC of both the fluoroquinolones was 15 micrograms/ml for the resistant S.dysenteriae 1 strain (NRM4). Therefore, the careful use of antimicrobials is required for therapy of Shigellosis.
