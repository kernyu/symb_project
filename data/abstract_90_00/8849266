Searching through a collection of 124 Staphylococcus aureus clinical strains, we found one isolate, strain 01A1032, that inactivates 14- and 16-membered macrolides. The products of inactivation were purified from supernatant fluids of cultures exposed to erythromycin for 3 h and were found to be identical to products of inactivation from Escherichia coli strains that encode either an EreA or EreB esterase. Further, strain 01A1032 was shown to be resistant to azithromycin, a 15-membered macrolide, by an alternate mechanism, efflux. Thus, strain 01A1032 harbors determinants encoding an esterase activity that hydrolyzes 14- and 16-membered macrolides and a macrolide efflux system.
