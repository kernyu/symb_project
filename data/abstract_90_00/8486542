One hundred and sixty-five isolates of Leuconostoc spp. were tested for bacteriocin production. Only one strain, Leuc. mesenteroides ssp. mesenteroides FR 52, isolated from a raw milk, produced a bacteriocin which was named Mesenterocin 52. This bacteriocin inhibited other Leuconostoc strains and several strains of Enterococcus and Listeria spp. No activity was found against lactococci and lactobacilli. The antibacterial spectrum differed from that of previously described Leuconostoc bacteriocins. Mesenterocin 52 was secreted into the medium during the growth phase. It was inactivated with protease treatments. At pH 7.0 it had a relative stability after heating at 100 degrees C (15 min), but it had a greater stability at pH 4.5 than at pH 7.0 after 6 h at 80 degrees C. The apparent molecular mass was estimated to be less than 10 kDa by ultrafiltration. Mesenterocin 52 showed a bactericidal effect on Leuconostoc paramesenteroides DSM 20288.
