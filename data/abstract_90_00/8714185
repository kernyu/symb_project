PURPOSE: To study the emergence of amoxicilline/clavulanate resistance in Salmonella and Shigella. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We have studied 118 strains of Salmonella enterica and 11 strains of Shigella flexneri isolated in our laboratory along 1993. The MICs values for amoxicilline/clavulanate were determined by the E-Test method and confirmed by the standard agar dilution method. RESULTS: We have observed that 6% (7 out of 118 strains) of Salmonella enterica and 42% (5 out of 11 strains) of Shigella flexneri isolates exhibited an intermediate susceptibility or were resistant to amoxicilline/clavulanate with MICs values ranging between 16 mg/l and 32 mg/l. CONCLUSIONS: Along 1993 we have detected the emergence of an amoxicilline/clavulanate resistance in salmonellae and shigellae strains. To our knowledge this fact has not been published up to now (Medline, 1990-October 1994). We don't know the clinical importance of this fact.
