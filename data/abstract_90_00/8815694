Nevirapine is a potent antiretroviral agent whose use, especially as monotherapy, may be limited by rapid onset of resistance as well as by hypersensitivity reactions. However, virologic features of nevirapine suggest that it may be useful in combination therapy with zidovudine or other antiretrovirals, including for patients infected with zidovudine-resistant strains HIV.
