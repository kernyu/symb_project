Current view on the role of Helicobacter pylori (Hp) infection in the pathogenesis of peptic ulcer disease is presented. It was shown that Hp is an important risk factor for the development of the disease for which other cofactors are necessary. Different drug regiments for Hp eradication are discussed. The eradication rates of 80 to 90 percent are achievable--most often including 7-10 days triple therapy (drugs increasing intragastric pH, antibiotics and antimicrobial agents). Resistance of Hp to used antibiotics and antimicrobial drugs is underlined.
