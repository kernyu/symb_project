To investigate the antibiotic activity of cefteram (CFTM), the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of CFTM and of the control drugs were determined against clinically isolated strains received from November 1991 to April 1993 from 19 dental facilities throughout the country, as well as against clinically isolated strains from samples obtained at this center from patients with dental infectious diseases, and the following results were obtained. 1. 430 strains were detected in 198 cases but identified strains amounted to 425. They are comprised of 204 strains of oral streptococci (48.0%), 81 strains of Peptostreptococcus spp. (19.1%), 10 strains of Bacteroides spp. (2.4%), 23 strains of Prevotella spp. (5.4%), and 9 strains of Porphyromonas spp. (2.1%). The ratios of Gram-positive bacteria v.s. Gram-negative bacteria were 78.4% and 21.6%, respectively, and the Gram-positive bacteria were isolated at higher frequency than Gram-negative bacteria. 2. The MIC90's of CFTM against oral streptococci and Peptostreptococcus spp. were 0.10 microgram/ml and 0.05 microgram/ml, and year to year increases of incidences of resistance against CFTM were not observed. Some strains, however, appeared to have obtained resistance to CFTM. 3. Among Bacteroides spp., Prevotella spp., Porphyromonas spp. which used to belong to genus Bacteroides, there were some strains resistant to CFTM. As a whole, however, no year to year increases in the incidence of CFTM resistance among these strains also. 4. Two strains of 6 Staphylococcus aureus subsp. aureus were methicillin-resistant. 5. The above observations indicate that CFTM still shows strong antimicrobial activity against clinically isolated strains that may be involved in dental infections.
