Expression of inducible high level vancomycin resistance (Vmr) in enterococci appears to require other plasmid-encoded genes in addition to the previously described structural genes vanA and vanH. Tn917 mutagenesis was used to identify such a region in the Vmr plasmid pHKK100. Insertional inactivation of a 693-bp open reading frame upstream from vanH resulted in complete loss of Vmr. This putative 26,642-Da protein has been designated VanR.
