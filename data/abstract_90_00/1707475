The Saccharomyces cerevisiae APN1 gene encoding an AP endonuclease/3'-diesterase was engineered in vitro for expression in Escherichia coli. The expression vector directs the synthesis in E. coli of a Mr 40,500 protein that reacts with anti-Apn1 antibodies and has the DNA-repair activities characteristic of Apn1 isolated from yeast. A band corresponding to Apn1 was observed in DNA repair activity gels only with extracts of E. coli harbouring the APN1 expression plasmid. Expression of Apn1 conferred resistance to oxidants and alkylating agents in E. coli lacking exonuclease III and endonuclease IV. For H2O2 damage, this rescue effect was correlated with the repair of oxidative lesions in the bacterial chromosome by the Apn1 protein. Thus, Apn1 can function in bacteria in a manner similar to its proposed multiple functions in yeast.
