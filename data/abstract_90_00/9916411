We treated two cases of primary pulmonary cryptococcosis with fluconazole (FLCZ), the clinical usefulness of FLCZ was evaluated. FLCZ was administered orally in doses of 300 mg daily for about six months. Concentrations of FLCZ were measured in the serum of the two cases and in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid in one case. The following results were obtained: 1. Clinical cures were obtained in the two cases. 2. The serum levels of FLCZ was 15.1 microliters/ml, 13.6 micrograms/ml two hours after administration of 100 mg in case 1, that of levels were 11.1 micrograms/ml, 8.9 micrograms/ml one hour and 4.5 hours, respectively, after administration of 100 mg in case 2. BAL was performed 4.5 hours after administration of 100 mg in case 2, the BAL fluid level of FLCZ was 0.7 microgram/ml. 3. The minimal inhibitory concentration of FLCZ against one strain obtained from the cytology brush in case 1 was 4.0 micrograms/ml. 4. The cryptococcal antigen titer decreased with the improvement of clinical signs and the resolution of chest X-ray abnormalities within about six months, and there was no relapse. From these results, we consider that FLCZ is a useful antifungal agent for primary pulmonary cryptococcosis, and we therefore recommend a six month treatment.
