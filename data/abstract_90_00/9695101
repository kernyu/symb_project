The genetic differences between praziquantel-resistant (R) and susceptible (S) strains of Schistosoma mansoni (Fallon & Doenhoff, 1994) were explored using RAPD and by cloning differentially expressed mRNAs by subtractive PCR. No differences between the 2 strains were detectable by RAPD using 41 different primers indicating that no major genomic rearrangements were present. Subtractive PCR generated a number of fragments, 1 of which was shown to correspond to an over-expressed mRNA in the R strain and to encode a fragment of the subunit 1 of cytochrome-c oxidase (SCOX1). In the absence of a complete sequence for this gene, we used EST sequences to compile a consensus sequence for the 904 bp at the 3' end that enabled us to choose primers for semi-quantitative RT-PCR. This technique showed that SCOX1 was indeed over-expressed about 5 to 10-fold in the R strain whereas the genes encoding the 28 kDa glutathione S-transferase, glutathione peroxidase, NADH dehydrogenase subunit 5 and the ATP-binding cassette family protein SMDR2 were not. In contrast, cytochrome-c oxidase enzyme activity was 4-fold lower in the R strain than in the S strain.
