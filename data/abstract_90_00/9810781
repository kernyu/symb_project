Vancomycin therapy is frequently used for peritonitis in patients on peritoneal dialysis, but the emergence of resistance has been reported. We evaluated the efficacy of a single intraperitoneal dose of vancomycin for peritonitis in peritoneal dialysis patients. We assessed 24 episodes of peritonitis in 16 patients, and compared clinical parameters between responders and nonresponders. Vancomycin was effective for 12 patients (18 out of 24 episodes, 75.0%). Nonresponders had a significantly higher initial C-reactive protein level and dialysis fluid leukocyte count, and the mean serum albumin over three months before onset was significantly lower than in responders. Patients with a serum albumin level 3.0 g/dl or more were significantly more likely to respond than those with a level less than 3.0 g/dl. In conclusion, it seems reasonable for peritonitis patients with a mild inflammatory response and a serum albumin 3.0 g/dl or more to receive intraperitoneal vancomycin on an outpatient basis.
