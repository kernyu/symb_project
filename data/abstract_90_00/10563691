Rifampicin has been successfully used as an adjunct to vancomycin therapy in several clinical conditions of MRSA infections such as endocarditis, ventriculoperitoneal shunts and septicaemia. However, very little information is available in the literature regarding its use in MRSA septicaemia in burns. The present prospective study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of rifampicin as an adjunct therapy in burn cases with MRSA septicaemia not responding well to vancomycin. Fourteen out of 36 MRSA septicaemia patients with burns who either did not or only partially responded to therapeutic doses of vancomycin within 5-6 days were treated with rifampicin as an adjunct therapy (600 mg, i.v., o.d) for 5 days during the study period between January 1995 to December 1998. All the patients had burns due to flame and the TBSA varied between 20-90% with a mean of 64%. Eleven patients had deep and three had mixed burns. MRSA septicaemic episodes usually followed 2 3 days of detection of the organism in burn wounds. All the isolates were sensitive to vancomycin with an MIC of < or = 1.0 mg/L and were treated with vancomycin, (500 mg, i.v., 6 hourly). The serum vancomycin levels in all the patients were within the therapeutic range. However, blood cultures still remained positive even after 5-6 days of therapy. Institution of rifampicin, as an adjunct to vancomycin therapy to which the MRSA isolates were susceptible, showed a dramatic clinical response and survival of grafts. Thirteen patients survived and one died who had 70% deep burns and blood cultures revealed a multiresistant Acinetobacter in addition to MRSA. The present study thus confirms the efficacy of clinical use of rifampicin as an adjunct in vancomycin nonresponding cases of MRSA septicaemia in burns.
