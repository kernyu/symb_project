Amoxyclav (amoxycillin/potassium clavulanate, A/PC) was used in the treatment of 55 children with acute bronchitis and pneumonia. The drug was administered in a dose of 20-40 mg/kg body weight a day in 3 portions. The treatment course was 4 to 10 days. The treatment was performed under careful clinicoroent-genologic control. The clinical picture of the disease in the children was characterized by a moderate process which made it possible to treat the children as outpatients. The clinical efficacy amounted to 90.5 per cent. The isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus influenzae proved to be susceptible to A/PC. It may be used as the 1st class agent in the treatment of children with lower respiratory tract infection.
