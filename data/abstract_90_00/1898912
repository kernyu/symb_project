Acquired resistance to Mycobacterium leprae, the etiologic agent of leprosy, crucially depends on cellular immune mechanisms. In addition to interleukin-mediated helper functions, killer mechanisms seem to be involved. This study addresses the question of how M. leprae render mononuclear phagocytes and Schwann cells, its natural targets, susceptible or resistant to killer cells. Killer activities were stimulated in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy individuals by incubation with mycobacteria plus interleukin-2. These cells lysed Schwann cells and mononuclear phagocytes which had been pulsed with dead M. leprae, while unpulsed targets remained virtually unaffected. Importantly, targets infected with viable M. leprae were not lysed; furthermore, infection with viable M. leprae as well as gamma interferon stimulation or heat shock caused resistance in otherwise susceptible targets which had been pulsed with dead M. leprae. Thus, M. leprae markedly influenced the effect of killer cells on Schwann cells and mononuclear phagocytes.
