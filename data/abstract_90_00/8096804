The induction of T helper cell subsets during the course of non-lethal or lethal blood-stage Plasmodium chabaudi AS infection was investigated using inbred strains of mice which differ in the level of resistance to this intraerythrocytic parasite. Resistant C57Bl/6 mice experience a non-lethal course of infection characterized by moderate levels of both parasitaemia and anaemia and resolution of primary acute infection by 4 weeks, while susceptible A/J mice experience lethal infection with fulminant parasitaemia and severe anaemia. T helper subset function was assessed during infection by determining the kinetics of spleen cell production in vitro of the Th1-derived cytokine, interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), and of the Th2-derived cytokine, IL-5, using sandwich ELISAs. Spleen cells from resistant C57Bl/6 mice were found to produce high levels of IFN-gamma within 1 week of infection in response to both the mitogen concanavalin A (Con A) and malaria antigen. Furthermore, CD4+ T cells were found to be the source of IFN-gamma while both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were found to produce IL-5. Decreased IFN-gamma production after day 10 was concomitant with significant production of IL-5 between 2 and 3 weeks post infection. In contrast, spleen cells from susceptible A/J mice produced high levels of IL-5 within the first week of infection. In addition, these animals were found to have high serum levels of IL-5. These results, thus, confirm previous observations that resolution of primary blood-stage P. chabaudi infection occurs by sequential activation of Th1 CD4+ T cells followed by activation of the Th2 subset, and in addition, suggest that induction of a strong Th2 response early in infection may lead to a severe and lethal course of malaria.
