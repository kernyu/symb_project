The aim of the study to determine the resistance to certain antibacterial drugs of the aerobic and anaerobic bacterial flora isolated from patients operated on for acute abdominal infections. The resistance was investigated by the disc diffusion method. Among the isolated aerobes Enterobacteriaceae, Enterococcus spp, Pseudomonas spp. Staphylococcus spp were most frequent, and in the group of anaerobes the most frequent were Bacteroides spp, Peptostreptococcus spp and Peptococcus spp. The sensitivity to ciprofloxacin, gentamicin and cefoperazone was tested in 492 aerobic strains, and the sensitivity of cefuroxime was tested in 387 strains. In the group of anaerobes the sensitivity to ciprofloxacin and cefoperazone was tested in 239 strains, and in 187 and 176 strains the sensitivity to cefuroxime and metronidazole respectively was tested. Only 94 aerobic strains and 32 anaerobic strains were additionally tested for augmentin, ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, imipenem, clindamycin and doxycycline. Imipenem was found to be the most active drug against aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Clindamycin showed a very high activity against anaerobes but was significantly less active against aerobes. Only a small proportion of the tested aerobic strain (11.2%) were resistant to ciprofloxacin, while most anaerobic strains (66.5) were resistant to this antibiotic. Metronidazole was active against about 100% of anaerobes. Augmentin had a high activity against gram-positive cocci and was less active against gram-negative rods and anaerobes. A high proportion of aerobic and anaerobic strains were resistant to ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, cefuroxime and doxycycline. Gentamicin showed a sufficient activity against the tested aerobic strains (33.9% were resistant).
