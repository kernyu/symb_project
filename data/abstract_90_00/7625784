BO-2727, a new injectable carbapenem, was evaluated for its in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities in comparison with those of biapenem, meropenem, imipenem, cefpirome, and ceftazidime. BO-2727 had activity comparable to that of imipenem against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci and streptococci, with MICs at which 90% of strains tested (MIC90s) are inhibited being equal to 0.5 microgram/ml or less. Against methicillin-resistant staphylococci, BO-2727 was the most active among the antibiotics tested, with MIC90s ranging from 4 to 8 micrograms/ml. BO-2727 was highly active against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis, with MIC90s ranging from 0.006 to 2 micrograms/ml. BO-2727 was also highly active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (imipenem-susceptible strains), for which the MIC90 was 2 micrograms/ml, which was lower than those of imipenem, cefpirome, and ceftazidime and comparable to those of biapenem and meropenem. Differences in activity between BO-2727 and the other carbapenems against imipenem-resistant P. aeruginosa were particularly striking (MIC90, 8 micrograms/ml). Furthermore, BO-2727 displayed a high degree of activity against many of the ceftazidime-, ciprofloxacin-, and/or gentamicin-resistant isolates of P. aeruginosa. The in vivo efficacy of BO-2727 against experimental septicemia caused by gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and imipenem-resistant P. aeruginosa, reflected its potent in vitro activity and high levels in plasma.
