The preliminary results of the Concorde trial demonstrated the transient clinical benefit of monotherapy with zidovudine (AZT) in asymptomatic persons infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). This result, which has been widely disseminated and discussed, was predictable given the previous demonstration of the development of resistance to AZT in isolates from individuals receiving prolonged treatment with the drug and given the finding that didanosine (ddI) is more efficacious than continued therapy with AZT in individuals who have received > or = 6 months of AZT monotherapy. On the basis of these findings, interest in combinations of antiretroviral agents has continued to grow. Many in vitro studies of nucleoside and nonnucleoside inhibitors of reverse transcriptase combined with interferon-alpha or inhibitors of protease have been published. In addition, numerous clinical trials of various combinations have been completed or are under way. Dr. Martin Hirsch and his colleagues at the Massachusetts General Hospital have been among the leaders of this effort. He and Dr. Angela Caliendo review, in this AIDS Commentary, the current state of our knowledge regarding the potential utility of combination therapy for infection with HIV-1.
