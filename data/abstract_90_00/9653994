The effects on liveweight gain and development of immunity were studied in lambs trickle infected for 8 weeks with either a benzimidazole-resistant isolate (Moredun ovine resistant isolate, MORI), a multiple benzimidazole + ivermectin-resistant isolate (Moredun caprine resistant isolate, MCRI) or an unselected susceptible isolate (Moredun ovine susceptible isolate, MOSI) of Teladorsagia circumcincta. Plasma pepsinogen concentrations of infected groups were significantly elevated compared to an uninfected control group (P < 0.001) by day 14. The liveweight gains varied markedly but there were no statistical differences between the infected and uninfected control groups at any point in time during the study. Lambs infected with the MORI had significantly lower faecal consistency scores than the other challenged groups on days 7 and 14 (P < 0.05) but from day 21 onwards, faecal consistencies were similar in all of the groups. There was a notable difference in the pre-patent periods of the different isolates with the MOSI producing positive faecal egg counts (FECs) by day 14 of the study. The FECs remained reasonably low once infections had reached patency and there were no further differences between the groups. Following administration of anthelmintic to remove residual worms from the trickle infection, no differences between the infected groups in terms of worm burden or mucosal mast cell numbers were evident as a consequence of a single challenge infection. The changes in genetic code associated with enhanced resistance against anthelmintics do not appear to have resulted in any fundamental alteration of the pathogenicity and immunogenicity of these three isolates of Teladorsagia.
