The effect of the antitumor drug lonidamine (LND) on respiration, aerobic glycolysis, adenylate pool, doxorubicin (DOX) uptake, and efflux in DOX-resistant and DOX-sensitive Ehrlich tumor cells was investigated. The results may be summarized as follows: 1) In both types of cells, LND inhibited both respiration and glycolysis in a dose-dependent manner and lowered the ATP concentration. The effect was more marked in cells incubated in glucose-free medium; 2) LND raised, to a remarkable extent, the intracellular content of DOX in resistant and sensitive cells respiring on endogenous substrates because of reduced ATP availability, whereas in glucose-supplemented medium, where both respiration and glycolysis contributed to ATP synthesis, the increase was lower; and 3) when LND was added to DOX-loaded cells, it failed to significantly inhibit DOX efflux because of time-dependent phenomena. These findings indicated that LND, a drug currently employed in tumor therapy, might also be useful in reducing or overcoming multidrug resistance (MDR) of those cells with a reduced ability to accumulate and retain antitumor drugs.
