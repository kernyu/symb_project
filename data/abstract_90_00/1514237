One hundred clinical isolates of Salmonella choleraesuis subsp. choleraesuis serovar dublin (Salmonella dublin) were examined for phage sensitivity, antibiotic resistance patterns, and plasmid content. Computer analysis of the lysis patterns observed by using 27 typing phages divided the S. dublin isolates into 26 groups. One lytic pattern (Designated pattern 16) contained 52% of the isolates examined whereas 16 isolates had unique patterns, and nine patterns had fewer than ten members. Although 14 antibiotic resistance patterns were observed among the 100 isolates, 79% of the isolates grouped in three major patterns. Seven plasmid groups were identified and designated A-G based on the large plasmids found in the isolates. Of the 100 isolates, 28 contained the plasmid profile of Group A, 28 were Group B, 7 were Group C, 34 were Group D, and 1 isolate each was observed in Groups E, F, and G. The strong association between antibiotic resistance pattern and plasmid type suggest that the drug resistance genes are plasmid borne.
