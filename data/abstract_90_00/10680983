The pathogenesis of ganciclovir-resistant cytomegalovirus (CMV) was investigated by analysing UL97 and gB sequences in tissues obtained from 4 immunocompromised patients with infections caused by ganalciclovir-resistant virus. UL97 and gB sequences were obtained by automated sequencing of CMV DNA amplified from lysates prepared from deparaffinized tissue sections. Patient 1 contained wild-type UL97 and gB3 sequences. Patient 2 harboured genetically distinct viruses in his lung: one with a ganciclovir-resistance UL97 mutation and a gB3 genotype, and another without UL97 mutations and a gB1 genotype. In patient 3, a ganciclovir-resistant UL97 mutant virus with a gB1 genotype was cultured from the lung, whereas the CMV in the brain did not contain mutations and its genotype was gB2. In patient 4, ganciclovir-resistance UL97 sequences were found in oesophageal tissue prior to the isolation of a ganciclovir-resistant CMV from the blood. All viruses in this patient had a gB3 genotype. CMV containing ganciclovir-resistance UL97 mutations may cause end-organ disease in immunocompromised individuals. In these subjects, CMV circulating in the blood may have similar or different UL97 and gB genotypes than the virus causing end-organ disease.
