We recently had three patients with pelvic dead space infection caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) after total cystectomy for urothelial cancer. All were male and aged from 67 to 74 years old. As for underlying diseases, two of them had bladder cancer and one of them had bladder cancer and right ureteral cancer. Total cystectomy and ileal conduit were performed for two patients with bladder cancer, and total cystectomy, nephroureterectomy and ureterocutaneoustomy were performed for a patient with bladder cancer and ureteral cancer. Pelvic dead space infections caused by MRSA appeared after 15-30 days postoperatively. All patients were cured after we locally administered 0.5 g of vancomycin twice a day for 10-11 days from the drains to the pelvic dead spaces. All patients had preoperative antitumor chemotherapy and the postoperative administrations of beta-lactams in common. From these results, we suggest that local administration of vancomycin is effective for the pelvic dead space infection caused by MRSA after total cystectomy.
