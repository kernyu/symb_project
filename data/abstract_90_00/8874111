UNLABELLED: The frequency of resistance to erythromycin of group A beta-haemolytic streptococci in the last 7 years was determined in three medical centres in Ankara. While all group A beta-haemolytic streptococci strains were susceptible to penicillin, a gradual increase in resistance to erythromycin until 1992 was observed. However, a substantial increase in erythromycin resistance occurred in 1993 when newer macrolides became available and were widely used in the latter part of 1992. CONCLUSION: The data show that frequent testing for resistance to erythromycin of group A beta-haemolytic streptococci is required for the use of this antibiotic in our country.
