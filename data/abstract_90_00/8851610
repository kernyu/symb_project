Sparfloxacin, a new fluorinated quinolone, exhibits higher in vitro activity against pneumococci than do ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin. Since up to 30% of cases of pneumococcal pneumonia are associated with bacteremia, and since an increasing percentage of pneumococci are resistant against penicillin, we studied the serum bactericidal activity of sparfloxacin against pneumococci in eight healthy, middle-aged volunteers. Pharmacokinetics in serum and urine after a 400-mg oral dose of sparfloxacin were comparable to those described by other authors. Inhibitory and bactericidal activities in serum were measured for four pneumococcal isolates representing penicillin-susceptible (one isolate), intermediately resistant (two isolates), and highly resistant (one isolate) strains. Geometric mean inhibitory titers ranged between 1:2.4 and 1:6.3 and bactericidal titers ranged between 1:1.3 and 1:3.6 during a time period of 1 to 6 h after drug intake. Although such titers were not sufficient to predict a clinical response based on previous pharmacodynamic studies using quinolone antibiotics, data obtained with volunteers may only partially reflect the clinical situation in which a rise of humoral antibodies directed against pneumococcal antigens may help to reinforce the bactericidal action of the antibiotic.
