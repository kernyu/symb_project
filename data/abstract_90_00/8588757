Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common conditions in clinical practice. For uncomplicated UTIs, the causative organisms and their antimicrobial susceptibility profiles are generally predictable, and empiric short course (3 day) antibiotic therapy after an abbreviated laboratory workup is advocated. Acute pyelonephritis requires a 2 week antibiotic course, often with initial parenteral therapy. Women with frequent recurrences of UTIs may require intermittent self-treatment or continuous or postcoital antibiotic prophylaxis. Catheter-associated UTIs generally only require treatment if the patient shows signs of systemic infection. Treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria is only recommended in certain circumstances. Careful consideration of the clinical circumstances, the patient's known or predicted urinary tract anatomy, and the antibiotic susceptibility of the bacterial pathogen(s) are critical factors in the choice of appropriate therapy for urinary tract infections.
