We observed 3 patients with a severe falciparum malaria infection. Although the patients appeared not to be seriously ill on admission, severe complications occurred. Renal impairment was a prominent feature and haemodialysis was sometimes necessary. Many hypotheses have been proposed regarding the aetiology of renal failure in Plasmodium falciparum but cannot yet be fully substantiated. Whatever the aetiology of renal failure might be, we believe that treatment should not differ essentially from that of acute tubular necrosis after circulatory shock and early diagnosis and treatment is imperative in spite of an initially ostensibly good clinical condition.
