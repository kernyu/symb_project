The tubercle bacilli detection rate was determined by direct bacterioscopy and the culture plate method immediately in the disease foci in 123 patients with pulmonary tuberculosis and 78 patients with tuberculosis of bones and joints. The culture plate method was shown to have significant advantages over bacterioscopy. However, in some cases with negative responses to the culture plate test, bacterioscopy was the only procedure that detected the pathogen in resected lung tissues. Parallel use of 2 different media in the culture plate test provided higher frequency of the pathogen isolation. Cultures isolated from the lung foci were showed drug resistance in 1/4 of the cases. Cultures from the bone foci were in all the cases but one sensitive to all the drugs used. By their biological properties, all the isolates belonged to human tubercle bacilli. The necessity of microbiological investigation of pathogenes in tuberculosis foci is grounded.
