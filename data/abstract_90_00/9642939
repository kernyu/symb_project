Five Shigella strains isolated from stool cultures of imported diarrheal cases in Japan, did not react to any antisera of the established Shigella serovars. These strains had the typical biochemical characteristics of Shigella dysenteriae, and were biochemically identical. All strains were positive in the Sereny test and other tests for invasivness; these indicate that they can cause shigellosis in humans. The results of antigenic analysis revealed that they did not belong to any of the recognized or provisional serovars, and were serologically indistinguishable. They had the same drug-resistance pattern (CP.TC.SM.ABPC.ST) and plasmid-profile. Strain 96-204 is designated as the test strain for this new serovar.
