The method of indirect electrochemical oxidation was used in treatment of 34 patients with acute purulent peritonitis. Twenty patients treated by the traditional method were taken as a group of comparison. The method consists in the elevation of sensitivity of the polyresistant microflora to antibiotics after the introduction into the abdominal cavity of a warmed to 37 degrees C 0.06--0.08% solution of sodium hypochlorite (100-400 ml), buffered with sodium bicarbonate 0.4 g NaHO3 per 100 ml. A combined application of buffered sodium hypochlorite with antibiotics to patients with local, diffuse and general peritonitis resulted in shorter average terms of treatment correspondingly to (9 +/- 0.9), (13 +/- 1.3), (16 +/- 1.9) days against (17.2 +/- 2.4), (25.0 +/- 3.3), (34.7 +/- 4.1) days after traditional methods of treatment. Only 2 patients died of 13 patients with general peritonitis (15.38%). Thus, modelling the processes of oxidative detoxication and phagocytosis with using a transmitter of acute oxygen--an electrolysis solution of sodium hypochlorite is a practically safe and technically simple method of the active action on the inflammatory process in the abdominal cavity, so it may be widely used in treatment of peritonitis.
