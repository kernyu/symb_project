Hydrophobic grid membrane filter technology was used to measure resistance among Escherichia coli in pig fecal samples to ampicillin, sulfisoxazole, and tetracycline. The method accurately measured resistance, with sensitivities ranging from 96.5 to 99.5% and specificities ranging from 87.0 to 98.3%, and it identified E. coli with 96% confidence.
