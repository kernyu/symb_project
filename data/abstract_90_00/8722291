The effects of enviroxime, disoxaril and ribavirin in pair combinations on poliovirus type 1 (Mahoney) replication in FL cells were tested. Beforehand, the fifty percent inhibitory concentration (IC50) was determined for each compound alone: enviroxime - 0.2 mumol/1, disoxaril - 0.3 mumol/1, ribavirin - 3 mumol/1. Combining enviroxime with disoxaril resulted in synergistic interaction, while combinations with ribavirin were markedly antagonistic. Enviroxime-and disoxaril-resistant poliovirus mutants appeared following 10 and 2 consecutive passages in FL cells, respectively. No cross-resistance was observed between these mutants towards disoxaril and enviroxime, respectively.
