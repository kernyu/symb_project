The aim of this study was to appreciate the accuracy of the technique for sensitivity test for M. tuberculosis. We have tested the same bacterial strains (101) using the same drugs concentrations, by absolute concentration method, and we have compared the results obtained in two different laboratories. The concordance of the obtained results (94.05% for SM, 97.03% for INH, 99.01% for RMP, 100% for EMB) is in the limits of reproducibility obtained by other authors. The obtained results show a good technique for sensitivity test in the two laboratories.
