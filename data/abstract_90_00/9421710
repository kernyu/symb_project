Recent decades have witnessed the emergence and spread of parasites resistant to standard drug therapies, particularly malaria. Chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium falciparum has now spread to most malarial areas, and resistance to other antimalarial drugs, including mefloquine and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine, have become significant problems in some parts of Southeast Asia and South America. Chloroquine-resistant P. vivax is well established in Papua New Guinea and Indonesia and has been reported in other areas. Trichomonas and Giardia infections resistant to metronidazole have also been documented. This article reviews the current status of drug resistance among parasites, particularly malaria, and offers strategies for managing patients with these infections.
