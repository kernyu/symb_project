Vomeronasal organs from female rats were dissociated and isolated microvillous receptor neurons were studied. The isolated receptor neurons kept the typical bipolar shape which they have in situ as observed by scanning electron microscopy. We applied the perforated patch-clamp technique using the cation-selective ionophore gramicidin on freshly isolated and well differentiated receptor neurons. The mean resting potential was -58+/-14 mV (n=39). The contribution of the sodium pump current to the resting potential was demonstrated by lowering the K+ concentration in the bath or by application of 100 microM dihydro-ouabain. The input resistance was in the range of 1-6 GOmega and depolarizing current pulses of a few pA were sufficient to trigger overshooting action potentials. In voltage clamp conditions a fast transient sodium inward current and a sustained outward potassium current were activated by membrane depolarization. These observations indicate that freshly isolated vomeronasal receptor neurons of rats can be recorded, using gramicidin, with little modification of the intracellular content. Their electrophysiological properties are very similar to those observed in situ. Four out of eight female vomeronasal receptor cells were depolarized by diluted rat male urine.
