The fact that a substantial proportion of tuberculosis drug resistance (especially multidrug resistance) is due to transmission of resistant strains or treatment failure in the UK underlines the need to strengthen control in this country. Early identification and effective treatment of cases (including measures to support adherence and appropriate use of initial treatment regimes involving at least four drugs in those at risk of isoniazid resistance) would help to control the problem [1].
