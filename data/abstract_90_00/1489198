The bactericidal activities of ampicillin and vancomycin against 40 recent isolates of Enterococcus faecalis were examined by kill-kinetic studies at concentrations of 4 x the MIC and 20 micrograms/ml. Greater killing was seen with ampicillin (3.57 +/- 0.87 and 2.50 +/- 1.09 log10 CFU/ml, respectively; mean +/- standard deviation) than with vancomycin (1.23 +/- 0.65 and 1.05 +/- 0.57 log10 CFU/ml, respectively). Highly gentamicin-resistant strains showed a tendency toward reduced susceptibility to killing; beta-hemolytic strains were more susceptible than nonhemolytic strains when exposed to ampicillin at 20 micrograms/ml. Within each group, individual isolates demonstrated great variability in susceptibility to killing by the drugs.
