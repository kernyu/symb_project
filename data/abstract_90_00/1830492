A DNA fragment, isolated from A. teichomyceticus and able to confer teicoplanin resistance in a sensitive host, has been sequenced. It reveals the presence of two open reading frames (ORFs) positioned on opposite strands, named ORF1 and ORF2. ORF2 seems to be responsible for the acquisition of the resistance character.
