Microscan (Dade Diagnostics, Brisbane) Positive Combo Type 6 (312 panels) and Rapid Positive Breakpoint Type 1 (62 panels) were evaluated for Staphylococcus aureus identification, using the tube coagulase test (TC), and oxacillin susceptibility, using mecA. A total of 374 consecutive clinical staphylococci were tested, with TC and Microscan having 100% correlation (335 identified as S. aureus and 39 as coagulase negative staphylococci by both methods). A 93% correlation was observed between Microscan and mecA PCR for oxacillin susceptibility. No very major errors (0/374 false oxacillin susceptibility) and 26 (7%) major errors (26/374 false oxacillin resistance) were found showing false resistance to oxacillin to be a problem in our population. Oxacillin Etest (AB Biodisk, Sweden) was performed on all oxacillin resistant isolates. A bimodal distribution was observed between mecA positive and negative isolates. A testing algorithm (using the Microscan panels and Etest) was developed for this laboratory to detect mecA encoded methicillin resistance. Retrospective application of this algorithm to the 374 isolates gave 100% correlation with mecA detection.
