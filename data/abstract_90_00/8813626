In isolated, constant-pressure perfused rat kidneys at basal vascular tone, injected P2 purinoceptor agonists evoked vasoconstriction (alpha, beta-methylene ATP > beta, gamma-methylene ATP > ATP-gamma-S > 2-methylthio ATP > ATP > ADP = UTP). In kidneys with raised tone, the nucleotides produced vasodilatation at low doses (2-methylthio ATP > ADP = ATP = ATP-gamma-S > UTP; alpha, beta-methylene ATP and beta, gamma-methylene ATP, inactive), and constriction at high doses (alpha, beta-methylene ATP > beta, gamma-methylene ATP > ATP-gamma-S > 2-methylthio ATP > ADP = ATP > UTP). Removal of the endothelium abolished the dilator responses to the agonists. NG-Nitro-L-arginine methylester (L-NAME, 5 x 10(-5) M) abolished vasorelaxation in response to 2-methylthio ATP, a response which could be restored by additional L-arginine (3 x 10(-3) M). Both vasodilatation and constriction due to the nucleotides remained unaffected by indomethacin (3 x 10(-6) M), S-(p-nitrobenzyl)-6-thioinosine (3 x 10(-5) M) and 8-phenyltheophylline (3 x 10(-6) M). Pyridoxalphosphate-6-azophenyl-2',4'-disulphonic acid (PPADS, 1-3 x 10(-6) M), inhibited vasoconstriction caused by alpha, beta-methylene ATP, 2-methylthio ATP and UTP, but not by ATP. Suramin (3 x 10(-5) M) caused a rightward shift of the dose-response curves for constriction caused by alpha, beta-methylene ATP (27-fold) and 2-methylthio ATP (5-fold), whereas the ATP curve was shifted to the left (20-fold). With Evans blue (10(-5) M), vasodilatation due to the nucleotides was abolished and the dose-response curves for vasoconstriction caused by ATP and UTP were shifted left more than 100-fold, the effect to both could not be antagonized by PPADS (3 x 10(-6) M). These results suggest: (1) the different rank orders of P2 purinoceptor agonist potencies for constrictor and dilator responses in perfused rat kidney are consistent with mediation via P2x and P2Y purinoceptors, respectively; (2) P2X purinoceptors, selectively sensitive to blockade by PPADS, are located on vascular smooth muscle; (3) endothelial P2Y purinoceptor stimulation results in vasodilatation involving NO synthesis but not release of prostanoids; (4) Evans blue, which appears to combine selective P2Y purinoceptor blockade and strong inhibition of ecto-nucleotidases, potentiates vasoconstriction in response to the degradable nucleotides, ATP, 2-methylthio ATP and UTP; (5) additionally, Evans blue unmasks a PPADS-insensitive P2U purinoceptor where the nearly equipotent nucleotides, ATP and UTP, can produce vasoconstriction.
