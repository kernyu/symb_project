In order to find new systems of host specificity (SHS), wide screening among different strains of Ps. aeruginosa was carried out. By means of cross-titration of phages BT and FP-series two new systems of modification-restriction were identified: Pae 610 and Pae 603. They differ from the known system of host specificity Pae R7.
