Infections caused by mycobacteria constitute important global health problems. During the last 50 years a number of drugs have achieved an established role in the therapy of these infections. These drugs, which are often used in combination, comprise both broad-spectrum agents that display antibacterial activity against mycobacteria and other organisms and narrow-spectrum agents whose activity is primarily restricted to mycobacteria, or even to individual mycobacterial species. In addition to the established agents, a number of investigational agents with antimycobacterial activity are at various stages in the research and development process. Several of the newer agents have arisen from the need to develop new drugs to combat the problems of emerging resistance to established agents. The mechanisms of action of the established drugs and investigational agents are reviewed in this update.
