The susceptibilities to 14 antimicrobial agents of 172 clinical isolates of the Bacteroides fragilis group from Korean patients during 1989 and 1990 were tested by an agar dilution method. All the isolates tested were susceptible to imipenem, chloramphenicol, and metronidazole. The rate of resistance to cefoxitin was 6%.
