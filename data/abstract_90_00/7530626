The prevalence of enterococci and nosocomial pathogens has increased over the past 15 years. They have become increasingly resistant to agents traditionally useful in the treatment of invasive diseases due to enterococci. Vancomycin resistance, first described in clinical isolates in 1988, has disseminated worldwide. It is usually associated with high-level resistance to penicillins and aminoglycosides rendering the treatment of patients with vancomycin-resistant enterococci very difficult. Several investigators have reported mortality rates greater than 50% for vancomycin-resistant enterococcal bacteraemia. Risk factors associated with vancomycin-resistant enterococcal bacteraemia include prolonged hospital stay, neutropenia, prior oral or parenteral vancomycin use, and broad spectrum antibiotics. Since there is no uniformly effective antimicrobial therapy for patients infected with vancomycin-resistant enterococci, preventing of the spread of infection with the rigorous application of barrier precautions and other infectious control techniques is of paramount importance.
