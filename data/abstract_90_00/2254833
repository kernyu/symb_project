The effect of unsupervised brushing with a dentifrice containing two antiplaque agents, 0.5% zinc citrate and 0.2% triclosan, on gingival health, plaque, supragingival calculus, and the oral flora was compared to brushing with a non-active control dentifrice. Volunteers were given oral hygiene instruction and their teeth were professionally cleaned. They then used a placebo dentifrice for a pre-experimental phase of 1 month, before being stratified into two groups on the basis of their initial plaque, gingival bleeding, and calculus levels, sex, and age. Over the following 6 months, one group used the control while the other used the test dentifrice. Plaque levels, gingival bleeding, and calculus were assessed at baseline and at 3 and 6 months. Supragingival plaque was sampled for microbiological analysis at the initial examination, at 3 and 6 months (conclusion of study period) and 3 months after the study. Representative oral bacteria and the development of bacterial resistance to triclosan were monitored. Results showed that plaque was reduced and gingival health significantly improved during the 1-month pre-experimental period. During the experimental period, this improvement was not maintained by the control group as gingival bleeding and calculus increased. In contrast, gingival bleeding and calculus levels of the test group were maintained significantly below those of the placebo group. Plaque levels were lower in the test group after 3 and 6 months, but the groups were not significantly (P = 0.05) different. No shifts in oral flora or development of bacterial resistance to triclosan were detected.
