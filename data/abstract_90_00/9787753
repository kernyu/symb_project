Detection of antimicrobial resistance is important so that clinicians can make rational decisions about optimal antimicrobial therapy for their patients. During the past decade, new types of antimicrobial resistance have emerged, some of which present new challenges for the clinical microbiology laboratory. In most cases, conventional culture-based testing methods continue to be useful. In other situations in which the organism responsible for infection grows slowly (for example, Mycobacterium tuberculosis), culture methods are technically difficult (such as for human immunodeficiency virus), or genotypes are inconsistently expressed (for instance, methicillin resistance in staphylococci), genetic susceptibility testing methods may offer special advantages. Determining serum concentrations of antimicrobial agents may be useful both to ensure adequacy of treatment and to prevent toxicity. In this review, methods are described for conventional and genetic tests used to guide antimicrobial therapy.
