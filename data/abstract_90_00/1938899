Penicillin-binding protein 2x (PBP 2x) of Streptococcus pneumoniae is one of the high-molecular-weight PBPs involved in the development of intrinsic beta-lactam resistance. Point mutations in the PBP 2x genes (pbpX) have now been characterized in five independent spontaneous laboratory mutants in order to identify protein regions which are important for interaction with beta-lactam antibiotics. All mutant genes contained two to four mutations resulting in amino acid substitutions within the penicillin-binding domain of PBP 2x, and none of the mutants carried an identical set of mutations. For one particular mutant, C606, carrying four mutations in pbpX, the mutations at positions 601 and 597 conferred first- and second-level resistance when introduced into the susceptible parent strain S. pneumoniae R6. However, the other two mutations, at amino acid positions 289 and 422, which were originally selected at the fifth and sixth isolation steps, did not contribute at all to resistance in similar experiments. This suggests that they are phenotypically expressed only in combination with mutations in other genes. Three PBP 2x regions were mutated in from two to all four mutants carrying a low-affinity PBP 2x. However, in a fifth mutant containing a PBP 2x with apparent zero affinity for beta-lactams, the three mutations in pbpX mapped at entirely different positions. This demonstrates that different mutational pathways exist for remodeling this PBP during resistance development.
