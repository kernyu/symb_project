Stable mutant cells spEBR-5, resistant to ethidium bromide in concentration of 5 micrograms/ml, have been isolated by multistep selection in mouse myeloma cells sp2/0-Ag14. The spEBR-5 cells, selected with ethidium bromide, appeared to be cross resistant to unrelated drugs in connection with mdr/lb gene amplification and overexpression. Five specific chromosomal markers were detected in the karyotype of spEBR-5 cells as a result of chromosome structural rearrangement. No cytological manifestation of gene amplification such as HCR of chromosomes or DMs was found. A diffuse location of amplified sequences in chromosome(s) is suggested. The new mutant cell lines spEBR-5 can be used as a model for investigation of multidrug resistance mechanisms.
