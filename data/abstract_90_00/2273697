Recently MRSA occupies a prominent position in nosocomial infections. We experienced 9 cases of severe MRSA infections in our department during the 10 months from Apr. 1989 to Jan. 1990. We investigated the clinical background of them. THE RESULTS of studies were as followed: 1) All cases were inpatients. 2) All cases were considered to be compromised hosts. 3) In 7 cases many kinds of catheters and apparatuses were pre-indwelt . 4) In 8 cases over 2 kinds of antibiotics and in 7 cases 3rd generation cephems were pre-administered. 5) The 5 cases, who were selected for coagulase typing, all belonged to type II. 6) All cases had almost similar patterns of drug sensitivity and were resistant to large amounts of antibiotics. All cases had good sensitivity to minocycline. 7) THE RESULTS: 3 died of sepsis and respiratory failure and 6 were alive (MRSA strains were still isolated in 3 cases and were eradicated in the other 3 cases 1-4 months after the therapy was started).
