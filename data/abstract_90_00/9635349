The large number of dental inflammations can be explained by the bad general dental condition in Hungary. Antibiotics have been used more extensively here then in several other countries. The recently introduced antibiotics are preserving the beneficial effects of the older ones with less side effects. The oral flora and their resistance to antibiotics are very different in certain countries. Therefore the professional protocols of the stomatological inflammations followed by certain countries cannot be applied directly in other countries. The changing resistance and the appearance of the new antibiotics make necessary the general evaluation of different antibiotics from time to time. The patients, the doctors and the society has the same interest: to get or provide more and more fast, safe and effective treatment. But to achieve this objective the dentists have to reevaluate their treatment habits accordingly.
