OBJECTIVE: To estimate the prevalence of resistance of Mycobacterium tuberculosis to first-line antituberculosis drugs in Canada. METHODS: M. tuberculosis isolates from one third of all culture-positive tuberculosis (TB) cases diagnosed between February 1, 1993 to January 31, 1994 in Canada were collected prospectively. Proportion of drug-resistant isolates and the factors related to drug resistance were measured. RESULTS: Of 458 study cases, 40 (8.7%) had resistance to at least one first-line antituberculosis drug, of which 5.9% had mono-resistance, 0.7% had multidrug-resistance(MDR-TB)--i.e., resistance to at least isoniazid and rifampin--and 2.2% had other patterns. The overall prevalence of resistance among the foreign-born cases was 10.6% with the highest level among those who resided in Canada for less than four years (15.5%). CONCLUSIONS: Canada has a relatively low prevalence of antituberculosis drug resistance and a very low prevalence of MDR-TB. Some new immigrants to Canada may be at higher risk for drug resistance and their initial treatment needs to be tailored accordingly.
