BACKGROUND: Enterobacter aerogenes is the fifth most frequent pathogen causing nosocomial infections. Several strains have developed multiple resistance by over-production of a natural cephalosporinase and by the presence of wide-spectrum betalactamases. CASE REPORT: A patient with chronic respiratory failure developed Enterobacter aerogenes pneumonia while under mechanical ventilation. The infection was successfully treated with a cefepime, sulbactam, gentamycin combination. DISCUSSION: Choosing the optimum antibiotic therapy is a difficult task in many nosocomial infections. In certain cases, combining a betalactamase inhibitor with the appropriate antibiotic can improve bactericidal activity and provide successful cure.
