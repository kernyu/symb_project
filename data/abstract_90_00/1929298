We describe a novel nucleoside analog, 2'-deoxy-3'-thiacytidine (BCH-189), in which the 3' carbon of the ribose ring of 2'-deoxycytidine has been replaced by a sulfur atom. In MT-4 T cells, this compound had significant time- and dose-dependent antiviral activity against five different strains of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) (mean 50% inhibitory dose, 0.73 microM); known 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (AZT)-resistant HIV-1 variants did not exhibit cross-resistance to it. BCH-189 also suppressed HIV-1 replication in the U937 monocytoid cell line as well as in primary cultures of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells; in these latter systems, suppression was fuller and longer lasting than that induced by AZT. Moreover, BCH-189 was less toxic than AZT in cell culture. BCH-189 may be a promising drug for the treatment of HIV-1-associated disease.
