Calreticulin has been identified previously as one of the androgen-response genes in the prostate. The role of calreticulin in androgen action was studied using androgen-sensitive LNCaP and androgen-insensitive PC-3 human prostate cancer cell lines. Calreticulin appears to be a primary androgen-response gene in cultured LNCaP cells because androgen induction of calreticulin mRNA resists protein synthesis inhibition. Calreticulin is a high capacity intracellular Ca2+ binding protein, suggesting that calreticulin expression is likely to be associated with the intracellular Ca2+ buffering capacity that could regulate the sensitivity to cytotoxic intracellular Ca2+ overload. As expected, androgen protects androgen-sensitive LNCaP but not androgen-insensitive PC-3 cells from cytotoxic intracellular Ca2+ overload induced by Ca2+ ionophore A23187. To provide evidence for the role of calreticulin in reducing cytotoxic effect of Ca2+ influx in prostatic cells, we have shown that calreticulin antisense oligonucleotide down-regulates calreticulin protein level and significantly increases the sensitivity to A23187-induced apoptosis in both LNCaP and PC-3 cells. Furthermore, calreticulin antisense oligonucleotide reverses the androgen-induced resistance to A23187 in LNCaP cells. The above observations collectively suggest that calreticulin mediates androgen regulation of the sensitivity to Ca2+ ionophore-induced apoptosis in LNCaP cells.
