UNLABELLED: This study aimed to establish the bacterial profile of bronchopulmonary infections confirmed by the cytobacteriological examination of sputum, in order to find therapeutical guidelines for empirical treatment. We included in the study 408 patients with clinical signs of bronchopulmonary infection (cough and mucopurulent sputum, fever) among which 294 hospitalised patients (5.5% of the 5280 admitted in 1997) and 114 outpatients. The sputum samples collected respecting the decontamination methods were examined cytobacteriologically (smear, culture and antibiogram). The spectrum of isolated bacteria was the following: H. influenzae--198 cases, anaerobes--54, Kl. pneumoniae--53, Ps. aeruginosa--50, S. pneumoniae--17. Analyzing the diseases for which the bacterial examination was performed, we found the following distribution: COPD--66, bacterial infections in TB patients--61, chronic suppurations--33, bronchiectasis--37, pulmonary abscess--24. We noticed the high frequency of H. influenzae and important numbers of anaerobes, Kl. pneumoniae and Ps. aeruginosa especially in COPD patients and patients with chronic suppurations. We performed antibiograms for establishing the sensitivity of bacterial samples (S. aureus, Kl. pneumoniae, Ps. aeruginosa, beta-lactamase-positive H. influenzae). Most of them were multidrug-resistant. CONCLUSIONS: 1. The cytobacteriological study of sputum may be useful for choosing the right treatment, especially for the patients with multiple antibiotic treatments and infected with multidrug resistant bacteria; 2. Knowing the bacterial spectrum in certain respiratory diseases allows the choice of empirical treatment for bronchopulmonary infections in uncomplicated cases.
