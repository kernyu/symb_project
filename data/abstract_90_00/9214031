The efficacy of local use of antiseptic solutions (chlorhexidine bigluconate, chlorfillipt and furaciline) on clinical presentation and microflora of purulent wounds was studied in 236 patients with maxillofacial abscesses and phlegmons. The wound microflora was represented by a wide spectrum of opportunistic agents. A pronounced therapeutic effect was achieved in patients with staphylococcal infection. Marked resistance to the drugs was noted in alpha-hemolytic streptococcus.
