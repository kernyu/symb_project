Naturally occurring mutations in HIV-1-infected patients have important implications for therapy and the outcome of clinical studies. However, little is known about the prevalence of mutations that confer resistance to HIV-1 protease inhibitors in isolates derived from patients naive for such inhibitors. In the first clinical application of high-density oligonucleotide array sequencing, the sequences of 167 viral isolates from 102 patients have been determined. The DNA sequence of USA HIV-1 clade B proteases was found to be extremely variable and 47.5% of the 99 amino acid positions varied. This level of amino acid diversity is greater than that previously known for all worldwide HIV-1 clades combined (40%). Many of the amino acid changes that are known to contribute to drug resistance occurred as natural polymorphisms in isolates from patients who had never received protease inhibitors.
