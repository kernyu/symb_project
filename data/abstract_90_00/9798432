Conversion varnishes are two-component, acid-catalyzed varnishes that are commonly used to finish cabinets. They are valued for their water and stain resistance, as well as their appearance. They have been found, however, to contribute to indoor emissions of organic compounds. For this project, three commercially available conversion varnish systems were selected. A U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Method 24 analysis was performed to determine total volatile content, and a sodium sulfite titration method was used to determine uncombined (free) formaldehyde content of the varnish components. The resin component was also analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy (GC/MS) (EPA Method 311 with an MS detector) to identify individual organic compounds. Dynamic small chamber tests were then performed to identify and quantify emissions following application to coupons of typical kitchen cabinet wood substrates, during both curing and aging. Because conversion varnishes cure by chemical reaction, the compounds emitted during curing and aging are not necessarily the same as those in the formulation. Results of small chamber tests showed that the amount of formaldehyde emitted from these coatings was 2.3-8.1 times the amount of free formaldehyde applied in the coatings. A long-term test showed a formaldehyde emission rate of 0.17 mg/m2/hr after 115 days.
