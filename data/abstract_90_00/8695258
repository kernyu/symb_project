59 patients were treated for newly diagnosed metastatic ovarian germ cell tumours with POMB/ACE chemotherapy (which contains cisplatinum, vincristine, methotrexate, bleomycin, actinomycin D, cyclophosphamide and etoposide). The median follow-up was 7.7 years. The 3 year survival is 87.8% (95% confidence interval 76.9-93.9%) and no relapses occurred more than 3 years after treatment. 4 (7%) patients had primary drug resistance to POMB/ACE and 4 (7%) have relapsed. One patient in complete remission developed secondary acute myeloid leukaemia after receiving a total of 1.3 g/m2 etoposide. 6 of 12 (50%) patients referred at relapse were salvaged by POMB/ACE. 14 of 33 (42%) women (> 18 years old) have had successful pregnancies after fertility conserving surgery and chemotherapy with no congenital abnormalities reported. The POMB/ACE regimen is as efficacious as other published regimens for ovarian germ cell tumours (OGCT) and balances a low incidence of life-threatening toxicity with a high success rate.
