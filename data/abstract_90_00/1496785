Fourteen nematode parasite-naive kids were given a mixed larval inoculum (approximately 17,250 infective larvae) via stomach tube. Twenty-two days after infection, the kids were randomly assigned to control and treatment groups of seven animals each. Mean eggs per gram for control and treatment groups were 4304 and 5315, respectively. Kids in the treatment group were given ivermectin (0.2 mg kg-1) administered by subcutaneous injection. At necropsy, the mean numbers of Haemonchus contortus and Trichostrongylus colubriformis for control and treatment groups were 2259 and 0, and 3033 and 773, respectively. This reduction was significant (P less than 0.05) for both species, resulting in an efficacy of 100.0% and 74.5%, respectively. The lower efficacy against T. colubriformis may be a sign of resistance, a reduced effectiveness due to route of administration, or a higher dose may be required with subcutaneous administration, as has been observed previously.
