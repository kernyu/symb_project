The nucleotide sequence of gene aadA2 of plasmid pSa, coding for aminoglycoside-3"-adenyltransferase, has been reexamined. We found differences with respect to the sequence previously determined by Tait et al. (R. C. Tait, H. Rempel, R. L. Rodriguez, and C. I. Kado, Gene 36:97-104, 1985). These deviations are located in the coding region and in the 3' noncoding region. By making deletions in the region for initiation of protein synthesis, we identified a GTG triplet as the most probable start codon for translation.
