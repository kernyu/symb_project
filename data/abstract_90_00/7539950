In this paper, a description of olfactory anatomy is presented, followed by a brief review of modern procedures for testing olfactory function. Information from the sole study which has quantitatively examined olfactory function in patients with apparent multiple chemical sensitivity (MCS) is presented. In essence, this study suggests that MCS is associated with increased nasal airflow resistance, respiration rate, heart rate, and scores on the Beck Depression Inventory, but not with significant changes in odor detection threshold sensitivity to phenyl ethyl alcohol and methyl ethyl ketone, the two target stimuli evaluated. Whether MCS patients evidence hypersensitivity to other chemicals is unknown.
