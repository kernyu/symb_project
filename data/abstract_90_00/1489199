We determined that resistance to ciprofloxacin has emerged in enterococci over the last 5 years in our hospital, mainly in strains demonstrating the phenotype of high-level gentamicin resistance. All high-level-gentamicin-resistant isolates from 1985 and 1986 were susceptible, whereas 24% of isolates from 1989 and 1990 were resistant to ciprofloxacin. Plasmid and genomic DNA typing showed at least six unique strains exhibiting resistance, but one type accounted for 80% of recent resistant isolates, suggesting a role for cross infection in the emergence of resistance.
