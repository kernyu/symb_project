Previously, a factor (Factor T) was found in aged mixtures of tungstate and phosphate, which greatly enhances the antibacterial effects of beta-lactam antibiotics on methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Factor T was purified and identified as undecaphosphotungstate ([PW11O39]7-). Undecasilicotungstate ([SiW11O39]8-), a compound closely related to undecaphosphotungstate, showed a similar enhancing effect.
