We have isolated three new temperature-sensitive mutants of 16S rRNA, using the U1192 spectinomycin resistance as a selectable marker. These differ from our previously characterized ts mutants in that they map in the upstream leader region of the rRNA precursor (at positions -13, -30 and -59). The relative distribution of plasmid and chromosome-derived 16S rRNA is similar between 30S subunits, 70S ribosomes and polysomes at the permissive and restrictive temperatures. Processing of the 5' end of the RNA does not appear to be affected by the mutations. Second-site suppressors were found, and all of these except one (which is within 16S rRNA) were also due to point mutations in the upstream leader.
