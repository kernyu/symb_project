Mycobacterium avium, Mycobacterium intracellulare complex (MAC) bacilli are an important cause of bacteraemia in AIDS patients but treatment is complicated by their resistance to the usual antimycobacterial agents. In this study of 20 strains of MAC none was found to have the mutations associated with resistance to rifampicin and streptomycin in M. tuberculosis suggesting that MAC have unique mechanisms for resistance to these agents.
