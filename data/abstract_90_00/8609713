PML has been identified through its fusion to the RAR alpha gene in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). The PML protein is specifically associated to nuclear bodies (NBs) whose alterations in APL were proposed to contribute to leukemogenesis. The role of this nuclear domain (which also harbors the Sp100 autoantigen and the NDP52 protein) is unknown. Here, we show that the PML protein, like Sp100 and NDP52, is induced by interferons (IFNs alpha, beta and gamma) in a large variety of human cells. Interestingly, the NBs that contain the three IFN-induced proteins appear to be associated to speckles labelled by the IFN-mediator Mx1. These observations link NBs to IFN response pathways, which may contribute to the elucidation of the biological role of these structures. In APL cells, IFNs induced both PML and PML/RAR alpha expression, resulting in an increased sequestration of PML and RXRs in the microspeckles induced by the fusion protein. As PML has growth suppressing properties, it may mediate some of the antiproliferative effects of IFN. In APL, inactivation of PML may result in disruption of growth control.
