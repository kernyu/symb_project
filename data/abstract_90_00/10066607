Exciting advances have been made during the past year: isolating mutants affecting plant disease resistance, cloning genes involved in the regulation of various defense responses, and characterizing novel defense signaling pathways. Recent studies have demonstrated that jasmonic acid and ethylene are important for the induction of nonspecific disease resistance through signaling pathways that are distinct from the classical systemic acquired resistance response pathway regulated by salicylic acid.
