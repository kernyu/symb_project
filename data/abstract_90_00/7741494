The median sternotomy is the preferred incision for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) but its usage was initially associated with wound infection rates of up to 5%. The advent of antibiotic prophylaxis and improved surgical technique has improved these rates to 1% to 2% in most series. During a 5-year period from January 1988 to December 1992, 2193 patients underwent CABG in the Singapore General Hospital. Of these, 22 (1%) suffered postoperative wound infection. Thirteen (0.59%) of these had deep-seated mediastinitis which involved the osteocartilagenous tissues and retrosternal space and 9 (0.41%) had superficial wound infections. The superficial infections were successfully treated with dressings and delayed closure in all cases. The deep-seated infections, however, required in addition, antibiotic therapy, povidone iodine irrigation, repeated debridement and flap closure. In total, 6 muscle and myocutaneous flaps were used with good result. This paper reviews the Plastic Surgery unit's experience in treating this difficult postoperative complication.
