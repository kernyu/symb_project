A novel approach for the preparation of oligonucleotides carrying amino groups at the 3'-end is described. Several CPG supports having aminoalkyl groups and 3'-amino-2',3'-dideoxynucleosides linked through base-labile carbamate linkages such as 2-(2-nitrophenyl)ethoxycarbonyl and fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl were prepared using two different strategies. These supports are compatible to the standard solid phase phosphite-triester methodology and yield oligonucleotides containing amino groups at the 3'-end. Several properties of the 3'-amino oligonucleotides, such as nuclease resistance, hybridization, and preparation of oligonucleotide conjugates are discussed.
