A study about bacterial colonization/infection has been performed in 523 newborn, consecutively hospitalized in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) of Verona. Bacteriological samples were taken routinely at the admission in all patients and selectively only in neonates at risk of infection. The obtained data revealed a significative prevalence of gram-positive organisms (particularly Staphylococcus epidermidis highly resistant to antibiotics commonly used); among gram-negative bacteria Pseudomonas spp. resulted the more frequently isolated micro-organisms. According to data obtained, antimicrobial approach to bacterial infection in our NICU is finally discussed.
