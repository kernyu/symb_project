The effect of combination of trimethoprim with other non-sulphonamide antibacterial agents, in particular oxolinic acid and nalidixic acid, was evaluated against Gram-negative fish pathogens. The species included Aeromonas salmonicida, Yersinia ruckeri, some Vibrio spp. and Escherichia coli as a reference. The extent of synergy found by other workers with these substances against human Gram-negative bacteria was not apparent here. Some positive interaction between trimethoprim and oxolinic acid was found with Aer. salmonicida, Y. ruckeri and E. coli and between trimethoprim and nalidixic acid with Y. ruckeri in double disc diffusion tests but was not supported by fractional inhibitory concentration indices. The combinations were not effective in preventing emergence of resistance in passage on a drug gradient. Trimethoprim-resistant isolates of Aer. salmonicida were inhibited by low levels of oxolinic acid but the converse did not apply.
