A clinical trial of pefloxacin as a single oral regimen in the treatment of acute uncomplicated gonococcal infection was evaluated in sixty-four male patients with clinical and laboratory diagnosis of gonococcal urethritis using a single dose of 800 mg pefloxacin. Of the 64 men, 59 (92.2%) were infected by (penicillinase producing Neisseria gonorrhoeae (PPNG) strains, while 5 (7.8%) had non-PPNG strains. The cumulative percentage cure for all infections was 84.4%. Pefloxacin is effective as a single dose therapy for acute gonococcal urethritis in males infected by penicillinase producing and non-penicillinase producing Neisseria gonorrhea in our area of study.
