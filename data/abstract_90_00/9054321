Mutants of S. kanamyceticus resistant to 2-desoxy-D-glucose (2-DOG) with impaired glucose repression of the kanamycin biosynthesis property were isolated. The effect of the carbon sources such as glucose, sucrose, maltose and glycerol on the biosynthesis of kanamycin by the mutants was studied in comparison to the wild type strain 1375 and strain 1, an improved variant with higher levels of kanamycin production. Significant differences in the level of kanamycin biosynthesis by the strains grown in the presence of the carbon sources were detected. Unlike the initial strains of S. kanamyceticus, the mutants resistant to 2-DOG synthesized kanamycin in the presence of high concentrations of glucose in the medium (2 or 5 per cent). Strains 1375, 1 and dgrl of S. kanamyceticus significantly differed by the rate of the glucose utilization. The rate of the glucose utilization by the highly productive strain 1 and 2-DOG resistant mutant was lower than that by the wild type strain 1375. Expression of the aminoglycoside resistance feature in the mutants with the impaired repression of the kanamycin biosynthesis property was studied in comparison with that in the initial strains of S. kanamyceticus. It was demonstrated that the mutants differed in the level of the resistance to their own and other aminoglycoside antibiotics.
