The beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations present a novel approach to the problem of beta-lactamase-induced resistance to antibiotics. These agents are derived from the generally safe beta-lactam class of antibiotics. They are all principally excreted through the kidneys and require dosage adjustment in the face of significant renal insufficiency. They show significantly increased activity against methicillin-sensitive S. aureus, H. influenzae, B. catarrhalis, and B. fragilis. The activity against Enterococcus, Pseudomonas, and most gram-negative bacilli, however, remains limited to that of the respective antibiotic component. Although shown to be clinically useful in a variety of clinical situations, they appear to be most useful for skin and soft tissue infections and lower respiratory tract infections as well as intra-abdominal and gynecologic infections caused by susceptible pathogens.
