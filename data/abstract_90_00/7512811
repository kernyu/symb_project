Polarographic determination of the rate of endogenic respiration of the cells of Staphylococcus aureus 209P showed that the respiration activity of the cells of the strain resistant to 20 micrograms/ml of gramicidin S was 20 to 30 per cent lower than that of the sensitive strain. The rate of oxygen consumption in oxidation of NADH by the membrane preparations of the resistant cells was also 25 to 30 per cent lower. By comparison with the initial sensitive strain the activity of endogenic DPI-reductases of the intact cells and NADH-dehydrogenases of the membranes of the resistant strain was also lower. The velocity of the valine transport to the resistant cells was much lower than that of the amino acid transport to the cells of the sensitive strain. Development of gramicidin S resistance in the staphylococcal strain was likely accompanied by a decrease in the activity of the energy metabolism in the membranes.
