A recent increase in the incidence of beta-lactamase-producing aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in upper respiratory tract infection has been associated with an increase in the failure rate of penicillin treatment of these infections. Experimental evidence for this correlation has been reported by many investigators, who have described the sheltering of susceptible pathogens by beta-lactamase-producing organisms as 'indirect pathogenicity'. The organisms implicated in mixed infections that cooperate are Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Branhamella (Moraxella) catarrhalis and Bacteroides spp., which are pathogenic and also normal oropharyngeal inhabitants. Since these bacteria exhibit both direct and indirect pathogenicity, effective treatment requires administration of antimicrobial therapy active against all microorganisms present in mixed infection. Oral third generation cephalosporins, which are resistant to enzymatic hydrolysis, seem to be suitable initial therapy.
