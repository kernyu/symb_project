Strain BF8 is a plasmid-free Bacteroides fragilis, resistant to 5-nitroimidazole (5-Ni) antibiotics (metronidazole, ornidazole and tinidazole). The resistance was transferable by conjugation into Bacteroides fragilis BF638R. The total DNA of a Nir transconjugant was used for the construction of a Sau3A genomic library in a B. fragilis cloning vector pFK707 delta H1 (4.2 kb). By electrotransformation of strain BF638R, a recombinant plasmid containing an insert of 5.4 kb was obtained which conferred to the host strain the resistance to 5-Ni. The physical map of the insert was established. After deletion analysis of the insert, the Nir determinant was localized on a HpaII-HincII fragment of 1.6 kb in size. This Nir determinant has been compared by Southern-blot analysis with other Bacteroides Nir determinants of plasmid origin.
