We administered teicoplanin as specific antibiotic therapy for nosocomial "ICU specific" infections with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and epidermidis (MRSA-MRSE). The above mentioned drug has been given to 20 patients (15 newborns and 5 not-newborns) admitted into intensive care unit during the years 1988, 1989, 1990 with MRSA-MRSE localized and/or systemic infection, affected by severe disease (RDS, pulmonary edema, congenital cardiac disease, cystic fibrosis) undergoing invasive procedures which presented high nosocomial infective risk (tracheal intubation, mechanical ventilation, venous and arterial cannulation, total parenteral nutrition, etc.). Complete recovery from systemic or localized infection (sepsis, low respiratory tract infection, high respiratory tract infection) occurred in 19 out of 20 patients, with a rate of success of 95%. Teicoplanin treatment lasted from a minimum of nine days to a maximum of thirty days. The dose was 5-6 mg/kg/die in one administration for the first three days, then 4 mg/kg/die. The tolerability of teicoplanin has proven satisfactory, since we had no major side effects during treatment and follow up.
