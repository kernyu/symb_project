Endothelin-1 is a potent endothelium-derived vasoconstrictor and pressor peptide with uniquely sustained activity. We have examined the contribution of endogenously-generated endothelin-1 to the maintenance of basal vascular tone in healthy subjects. In these studies, on separate occasions, a combined inhibitor of endothelin converting enzyme (ECE) and neutral endopeptidase (NEP), phosphoramidon, a selective inhibitor of NEP, thiorphan, and a selective ETA receptor antagonist, BQ-123, were given via the brachial artery. Big endothelin-1, the precursor to endothelin-1, caused a slow onset dose-dependent forearm vasoconstriction, the magnitude of which was consistent with about 10% conversion to mature endothelin-1 in the forearm. Vasoconstriction to big endothelin-1 was abolished by co-infusion of phosphoramidon, whereas vasoconstriction to endothelin-1 was unaffected. Phosphoramidon caused progressive vasodilatation when infused alone, with blood flow increasing by 37% at 90 min (P = 0.02), whereas thiorphan caused vasoconstriction, consistent with NEP inhibition exerting its major effect on degradation of constrictor peptides, such as angiotensin and endothelin-1. Vasoconstriction to endothelin-1 was completely abolished by coinfusion of BQ-123, and BQ-123 alone produced progressive forearm vasodilatation, with blood flow increasing by 64% after 60 min (P = 0.001). These results demonstrate that endogenous production of endothelin-1 acts to sustain vascular tone in humans and indicate that ECE inhibitors and endothelium receptor antagonists may have therapeutic potential as vasodilators.
