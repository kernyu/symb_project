To evaluate the correlation between zidovudine (ZDV) resistance mutations of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), biological parameters, and clinical evolution, 111 HIV-1-infected patients treated with ZDV were studied. Specific mutations at codons 70, 215, and 41 in the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase coding region conferring resistance to ZDV were detected using a selective polymerase chain reaction. The appearance of ZDV resistance mutations was significantly correlated with baseline clinical stage, CD4+ cell count, and viral load, but not with duration of ZDV therapy or p24 antigen level. In univariate analysis, results showed a prognostic role of mutations at codons 215 and 41 for clinical progression to the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) or death. In multivariate analysis after controlling for viral load, CD4+ cell count, and clinical stage, the presence of the mutation at codon 215 (but not at codon 41) remained an independent predictor of subsequent clinical evolution.
