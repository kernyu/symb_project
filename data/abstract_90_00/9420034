The distribution of the aac(6')-Ig gene, encoding aminoglycoside 6'-N-acetyltransferase-Ig [AAC(6')-Ig], was studied in 96 Acinetobacter haemolyticus strains and 12 proteolytic Acinetobacter strains, including Acinetobacter genomospecies 6, 13, and 14 and 3 unnamed species assigned to this genomic group by DNA-DNA hybridization. This gene was detected by DNA-DNA hybridization in all 96 A. haemolyticus strains and by PCR in 95 strains but was not detected in strains of other species, indicating that it may be used to identify A. haemolyticus. Three A. haemolyticus strains were susceptible to tobramycin and did not produce an aminoglycoside 6'-N-acetylating activity, although they contained aac(6')-Ig-related sequences. An analysis of three susceptible A. haemolyticus strains indicated that aminoglycoside resistance was abolished by the following three distinct mechanisms: (i) a point mutation in aac(6')-Ig that led to a Met56-->Arg substitution, which was shown by analysis of a revertant to be responsible for the loss of resistance; (ii) a polythymine insertion that altered the reading frame; and (iii) insertion of IS17, a new member of the IS903 family. These observations indicated that AAC(6')-Ig is not essential for the viability of A. haemolyticus, although the aac(6')-Ig gene was detected in all members of this species.
