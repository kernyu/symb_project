Fecal specimens were composited and a hydrophobic-grid membrane-filter method was used to measure antimicrobial resistance to ampicillin 16 micrograms/ml, carbadox 30 micrograms/ml, gentamicin 4 mu/ml, nitrofurantoin 32 micrograms/ml, spectinomycin 16 micrograms/ml, sulfisoxazole 32 micrograms/ml and tetracycline 8 micrograms/ml among 8119 Escherichia coli isolates from 68 fecal samples collected on 34 farrow-to-finish swine farms marketing over 500 hogs/yr. The overall prevalences of resistance to antimicrobials among these isolates were: ampicillin 29%, carbadox 3.5%, gentamicin 0.6%, nitrofurantoin 27%, spectinomycin 28%, sulfasoxizole 38% and tetracycline 71%. Thirty to seventy-six per cent of the variations in prevalences were explained by between-farm differences.
