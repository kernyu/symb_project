We determined the acyclovir (ACV) susceptibilities of herpes simplex virus (HSV) isolates (n = 18) recovered from solid organ transplant patients after antiviral prophylaxis with ACV or ganciclovir. All isolates tested were susceptible to ACV (50% inhibitory concentration, < 1 microM). A clinical review of patients with HSV disease showed that all improved with specific anti-HSV therapy, and no recurrences were reported.
