A total of 121 inpatients with insulin and noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus were investigated. The patients with noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus were divided into 2 groups with relation to the presence or absence of secondary resistance to sulfonyl urea derivatives. Changes in the plasma and lipoprotein concentration of cholesterol (ChS) and triglycerides (TG) were analyzed. According to the author's classification, changes in lipoprotein patterns were distributed in some phenotypes of dyslipoproteinemias (DLP) and their prevalence was studied among the examinees. DLPs were detected in 84.3% of the patients (59.8% were latent). The patients demonstrated a high frequency of hypocholesterolemia of very low density lipoproteins (57.8%) and hypertriglyceridemia of low density lipoproteins (31.4%). These intralipoprotein variations were shown to be the chief element of phenotypical characterization of II (c, d), IV (b, c) and VI (a, b, c) DLP types, not included in Fredrickson's classification.
