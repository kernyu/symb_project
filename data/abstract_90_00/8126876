The current state of causative bacteria in infectious diseases and the trends in resistance to antimicrobial agents were mentioned. The commonest micro-organisms isolated from the blood and intravascular catheter tips were CNS, S. aureus and C. albicans. Significant urine culture isolates were E. coli and other enterobacteriaceae in uncomplicated UTI, and Enterococcus spp. and Pseudomonas spp. in complicated UTI with a urinary catheter. In respiratory tract infections (RTIs), H. influenzae, S. pneumoniae, B. catarrhalis, S. aureus and P. aeruginosa, were common causative organisms. Community-acquired pneumonia was mainly caused by H. influenzae, S. pneumoniae and B. catarrhalis. In common with hospital-acquired pneumonia, P. aeruginosa, S. aureus and enterobacteriaceae were the frequent microorganisms isolated. In anaerobic infections, the most common micro-organisms were B. fragilis and other B. fragilis group isolated from intra-abdominal focus of post operative patients. The trends in the antimicrobial susceptibility of isolates of common bacteria over a period of 5 years (1988-1992) have been monitored. The proportion of isolates of S. aureus resistant to CEZ, CMZ, FMOX, IPM or MINO has increased. There was no trend towards increased resistance among isolates of P. aeruginosa except for CBPC. The incidence of resistance to PCG, ABPC, EM and LMOX increased in isolates of S. pneumoniae and that of resistance to PIPC, CMZ, LMOX and IPM increased in those of B. fragilis group.
