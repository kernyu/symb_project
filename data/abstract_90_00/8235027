Nocardia farcinica, isolated by Nocard in 1888, has recently been redefined as a separate species to asteroides and has been recognised as human pathogen since 1975. Following airborne contamination, lung infection is most usual with frequent dissemination especially to central nervous system. Usually drug resistance makes treatment difficult. The authors describe the first case of Nocardia farcinica disseminated infection in France with lung primarily affection, empyema and encephalitis.
