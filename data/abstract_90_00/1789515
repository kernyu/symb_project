The outer membrane protein (OMP), plasmid, and antimicrobial resistance profiles of Pasteurella haemolytica serotypes 1 through 12, a bovine isolate of P multocida, a chicken isolate of P multocida, and an unidentified Pasteurella species of bovine origin were examined. Isolates of P haemolytica serotypes belonging to the same biotype possessed similar OMP profiles. Biotype A isolates contained 2 prominent OMP of 43 kilodaltons (kD) and 29 kD, whereas biotype-T serotypes contained 3 major OMP of 43, 36, and 25 kD. The major OMP profiles of the 2 P multocida isolates and the unidentified Pasteurella species were different from each other and from P haemolytica isolates. Plasmid DNA screening indicated both plasmid-containing and plasmid-free P haemolytica and P multocida isolates. Multiple drug resistance was found in pasteurellae isolates with and without plasmids. However, a relationship between drug resistance and plasmid isolation was found in 3 of 4 haemolytica serotype 1 field isolates, all of which contained a 2.51-megadalton plasmid and had multiple drug resistance for benzylpenicillin, ampicillin, streptomycin, and tetracycline.
