One hundred fifty clinical isolates of Enterococcus faecalis (88 isolates) and Enterococcus faecium (62 isolates) were tested in vitro for their susceptibility to vancomycin and high-level aminoglycosides (HLA). Remel's Synergy Quad Plates (RSQ) were used as the reference method and compared to Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion test, Vitek GPS-TA card, MicroScan Panel (GP-6), and Etest. Streptomycin susceptibility results for MicroScan GP-6 and RSQ were recorded at 24 and 48 h and all other methods and antibiotics were read at 24 h or less. When compared with the agar screen method, all of the methods demonstrated > 99% agreement. One isolate was falsely sensitive to gentamicin at 24 h, but resistant at 48 h, when tested on both MicroScan and RSQ agar screen. Thirty-nine isolates showed resistance to vancomycin with all methods. These isolates were from three different local hospitals and were identified as E. faecium. Pulse-field gel electrophoresis demonstrated that all of the vancomycin-resistant isolates were derived from the same clone. Of interest is the observation that high-level resistance to aminoglycosides varied between the clonally related isolates.
