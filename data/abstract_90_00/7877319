Patients scheduled for cardiac operation often receive vancomycin before the operation to decrease postoperative staphylococcal wound infections. In animal studies, vancomycin depressed cardiac function approximately 15%. Because of the potentially serious consequences of myocardial depression in patients undergoing cardiac operation, we examined the effect of vancomycin infusion on cardiac hemodynamics in patients scheduled for cardiac operation. Patients who were scheduled for cardiac operation and vancomycin prophylaxis were enrolled in our study. After baseline cardiac output, mean arterial pressure, central venous pressure, and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure were measured, 1 gm of vancomycin HCl was infused over 1 hour. Cardiac output, mean arterial pressure, central venous pressure, and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure were measured at 15, 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes after the start of the infusion. In the 46 patients that completed the study, no significant change was observed in cardiac output or systemic vascular resistance at any time when compared with baseline. Mean arterial pressure increased significantly (p = 0.03) between baseline (90.8 +/- 2.4 standard error of mean) and 90 minutes (94.1 +/- 2.4 standard error of mean). One patient had a transient 30% fall in mean arterial pressure and systemic vascular resistance with facial flushing during the infusion. In conclusion, we found that vancomycin infusion over 1 hour in patients before cardiac operation is safe and not associated with cardiac depression.
