The isolation from patients of meningitis, of two multidrug resistant strains of H. influenzae is of relevance to the empirical treatment of meningitis patients. The isolates produced beta lactamase and had higher MICs as compared to the four H. influenzae strains sensitive to the drugs commonly used for the treatment of meningitis. The cephalosporins and gentamicin were found to be effective antibiotic agents. The occurrence of resistance to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, cloxacillin, cotrimoxazole, tetracycline, penicillin and erythromycin is of concern.
