The National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards has proposed a reference broth macrodilution method for in vitro antifungal susceptibility testing of yeasts (the M27-P method). This method is cumbersome and time-consuming and includes MIC endpoint determination by the visual and subjective inspection of growth inhibition after 48 h of incubation. Two alternative microdilution procedures for MIC endpoint determination, a spectrophotometric MIC endpoint test that evaluates 80% growth inhibition by the drug and a colorimetric method with an oxidation-reduction indicator (Alamar Blue), were compared with the M27-P method for fluconazole susceptibility testing of 45 susceptible and resistant isolates of Candida albicans. The spectrophotometric method was performed with RPMI 1640 medium with 2% glucose, and the other two tests were performed with plain RPMI 1640 medium. All tests were incubated at 35 degrees C. Excellent agreement was demonstrated between the M27-P method and both 24-h microdilution tests (97.7%) as well as between the two microdilution tests (95.5%). Also, there was agreement in the detection in vivo of fluconazole resistance by the three methods. These preliminary data indicate that both microdilution methods may serve as less subjective alternatives to the M27-P method for the determination of fluconazole MIC endpoints.
