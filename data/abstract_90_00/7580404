The population of types I and 2 herpes simplex viruses (HSV) to be studied consisted mainly of Acyclovir-sensitive strains. In some cases Acyclovir-resistant HSV strains were detected. The phenotypic profile of the Acyclovir-resistant strains were shown to have low reproduction rates in tissue cultures. Their antigenic character was similar to that of reference strains. Several phenotypic variants concurrently isolated from the same patient differ in their reproductive properties, antigenic characteristics, and sensitivity to Acyclovir. It is expedient to examine HSV isolates from patients for their sensitivity to chemicals used in clinical practice. This will allow patients with herpes infection to be treated on an individual basis.
