Streptococci other than Streptococcus pneumoniae are a rare cause of bacterial meningitis in adults. We report 29 cases of streptococcal meningitis (1977-1997). The patients comprised 19 men and 10 women, with a mean age +/- standard deviation of 47 +/- 18 years. Nine cases were secondary to neurosurgical procedures, seven to brain abscess, five to cerebrospinal fluid pericranial fistula, and three to endocarditis. Causative microorganisms included the following: viridans group streptococci, 20 cases; anaerobic streptococci, 3; Streptococcus agalactiae, 3; Streptococcus bovis, 2; and Streptococcus pyogenes, 1. Four Streptococcus mitis strains showed decreased susceptibility to penicillin (MIC, 0.5-2 microg/mL). Five patients (17%) died. The infection is increasing in the hospital setting. Streptococci resistant to penicillin should be considered in the empirical treatment of nosocomial meningitis. In cases of community-acquired infection, anaerobic streptococci or streptococci of the Streptococcus milleri group should alert the clinician to the presence of an undiagnosed brain abscess, whereas oral streptococci of the viridans group suggest the diagnosis of bacterial endocarditis.
