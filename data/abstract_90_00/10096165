Sixty percent of Staphylococcus aureus isolates from patients in Israeli hospitals proved to be non typable by the conventional phage typing method. Heat pretreatment improved typability only to 54% while reverse typing increased typability to 75%. In general isolates typable by conventional phages belonged to group V, II, III, I, or to mixed groups. While isolates typable only by reverse typing belonged to group III, II, the extended group III + IIIa, or to mixed groups, but seldom to group I. Although most isolates were resistant to penicillin G, only one half were resistant to other antibiotics as well. While one third of these isolates could by typed by conventional phage typing, typability was significantly improved to over 80%, by the use of reverse typing as the additional typing method. Two main groups of oxacillin resistant isolates were identified. The partial resistant group consisting of isolates resistant to penicillin G and oxacillin with no or few other resistances. These isolates were mostly typable by conventional phage typing (group V) and dominated in the first study period (1989-1990) but were only seldom isolated in the second one (1991-1992). The multiresistant group consisted of isolates resistant to penicillin G and oxacillin accompanied by resistances to 3-5 other antibiotics (chloramphenicol, clindamycin, erythromycin, gentamicin and tetracycline). These isolates were mostly typable by reverse typing (the extended group III + IIIa) and showed no change in isolation frequencies during the entire study period. Reverse typing is proposed by us as a typing tool for these multiresistant S. aureus isolates.
