Most patients with community-acquired pneumonia are treated as outpatients, and choice of therapy is usually empirical because the etiologic agent is unknown. Therapy should include coverage for both typical and atypical organisms. In geographic areas with highly resistant S pneumoniae, one of the newer fluoroquinolones should be considered, since resistance to penicillin is associated with cross-resistance to macrolides and tetracyclines. Once-daily dosing should be given strong preference because more frequent dosing results in poor compliance, which may lead to inadequate therapy and increased resistance. At present, the duration of therapy should probably be no less than 7 days. Patients should be categorized for mortality risk with objective scoring methods, and the need for hospitalization should be decided accordingly. Greater use of observational and intermediate-care beds is encouraged, as is improved utilization of pneumococcal vaccine.
