Glyteer (GL) possessed a broad antimicrobial spectra against bacteria and fungi. The antimicrobial activity of GL was bactericidal action, but not bacteriostatic action. GL was more effective against fungi than bacteria. GL ointment also showed antimicrobial activity equal to that of GL. Furthermore, GL had an effect on methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Resistance to GL was not induced in broth cultures of Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Candida albicans, and Trichophyton mentagrophytes. These results suggest that GL applied externally exerts a potent effect as an anti-microbial drug for dermopathy with various microbialpathogens.
