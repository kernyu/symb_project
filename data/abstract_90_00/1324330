In the last decade, there has been a dramatic increase in the isolation frequency of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in Japan. Especially, a high incidence of multiple resistant MRSA strains has been reported. These strains are resistant not only to beta-lactams but to aminoglycosides and macrolides. About 90% of MRSA strains were resistant to gentamicin (GM) and/or tobramycin (TOB), producing an aminoglycoside modifying enzyme, mainly, APH (2")/AAC (6) and/or AAD (4',4"). Based on these modifying enzymes produced, MRSA strains were classified into three groups; group 1 produced APH (2")/AAC (6), belonging to phage group I and coagulase IV, group 2 produced AAD (4',4"), belonging to phage group III and coagulase II, and group 3 produced APH (2")/AAC (6) and AAD (4',4"), belonging to phage group III and coagulase II. The epidemiological results suggest that MRSA strains changed from group 1 to group 2, and then to group 3. Recently, arbekacin (ABK), a new anti-MRSA aminoglycoside, has been introduced into clinical practice. ABK shows a potent activity to GM-resistant strains, due to poorly modification by APH (2")/AAC (6'). However, there were few ABK- and GM-resistant strains in clinical isolates. These strains produced a higher amount of the enzyme than ABK-susceptible and GM-resistant strains. This observation suggests that ABK-resistant strains might be derived from GM-resistant strains by mutation of the gene coding APH (2")/AAC (6').
