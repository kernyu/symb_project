We report a NSCLC patient effectively treated with anti-cancer agents on an outpatient basis despite chemotherapy with carboplatin and docetaxel, he relapsed after achieving a transient response. Combination chemotherapy with gemcitabine and vinorelbine administered every three weeks in an outpatient clinic caused the lung cancer volume to reduce remarkably. This regimen was well tolerated and suitable for outpatients. Its usefulness as a second line chemotherapy in the treatment of NSCLC should be investigated.
