A vector-transformation system is described that permits replacement of a portion of the single rRNA operon of the archaeon Halobacterium halobium with a homologous fragment from a vector-borne gene. The vector construct contains three functional sections: (i) an entire H. halobium rRNA operon with two selective mutations in the 23S rRNA gene, the substitutions of A----G at position 1159 conferring resistance to thiostrepton and C----U at position 2471 conferring resistance to anisomycin; (ii) the complete pHSB1 plasmid from Halobacterium sp. SB3, which interferes with vector maintenance in the transformed halobacterial cells; and (iii) a segment of the pBR322 plasmid that permits vector replication in Escherichia coli. Transformation of H. halobium with the vector plasmid generates cells resistant to both anisomycin and thiostrepton that can be selected for, and discriminated from spontaneous mutants, by a two-step selection procedure. After transformation, the plasmid recombines homologously with the chromosome so that the plasmid-borne rDNA segment with resistance markers substitutes for the corresponding region of the chromosomal rRNA operon, and the transforming plasmid is lost. Eventually, this leads to a homogeneous population of the mutant ribosomes in the cell. Other mutations that are engineered in the vector-borne rRNA sequences can be transferred to the chromosomal rRNA operon concomitantly with the selective markers. The system has considerable potential for ribosomal engineering.
