Treatment of Candida albicans with low concentrations of either hydrogen peroxide or menadione (a superoxide generating agent) induces an adaptive response which protects cells from the lethal effects of a subsequent challenge with higher concentrations of these oxidants. Pre-treatment with either menadione or hydrogen peroxide is protective against cell killing by either oxidant. This suggests that the pathogenic yeast C. albicans (unlike the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae which has separate responses) possesses an adaptive response that responds to both these oxidants. In addition, we found that C. albicans showed a greater level of resistance to oxidants, both H2O2 and redox-cycling agents, compared to that observed with S. cerevisiae. In an attempt to characterise the oxidative stress response in more detail we have analysed the effect of oxidants on the activities of a number of enzymes with known antioxidant activity.
