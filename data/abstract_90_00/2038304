We report the stable transformation of Physcomitrella patens to either G418 or hygromycin B resistance following polyethylene glycol-mediated direct DNA uptake by protoplasts. The method described in this paper was used successfully in independent experiments carried out in our two laboratories. Transformation was assessed by the following criteria: selection of antibiotic-resistant plants, mitotic and meiotic stability of phenotypes after removal of selective pressure and stable transmission of the character to the offspring; Southern hybridisation analysis of genomic DNA to show integration of the plasmid DNA; segregation of the resistance gene following crosses with antibiotic-sensitive strains; and finally Southern hybridisation analysis of both resistant and sensitive progeny. In addition to stable transformants, a heterogeneous class of unstable transformants was obtained.
