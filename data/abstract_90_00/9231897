In addition to the genes involved in tetracycline resistance, the loop region of the composite transposon Tn10 contains two other known genes, tetC and tetD, whose functions are unclear. Using primarily a genetic approach, we examined tetCD gene expression and regulation. The tetC gene product, TetC, is a diffusible repressor of both tetC and tetD transcription. Despite an earlier claim by others, we do not detect induction of either tetC or tetD by tetracycline (Tc) or several of its analogs. Although the 5' ends of the tetC and tetD messages overlap due to transcription from convergent promoters, we find no evidence for anti-sense RNA control. The operator for the TetC repressor has been localized. We also demonstrate that transcription from the tetD promoter probably terminates within IS10-Right and does not apparently interfere with Tn10 or IS10-Right transposition or its regulation.
