Alkaline phosphatase concentrations are known to increase in blood neutrophils of normal pregnant women. The main kinetic parameters of this enzyme were analysed and compared in a group of 30 women with normal pregnancies and a group of 11 women whose fetuses had trisomy 21 (Down's syndrome = DS). The subjects were studied at an identical stage of gestation. Significant changes occurred in thermal stability and urea resistance in cases of DS pregnancies. We also investigated the inactivation constants for two chemicals: L-p-bromotetramisole, an uncompetitive inhibitor, and sodium thiophosphate, a competitive inhibitor. Ki measured for the two inhibitors were found to be significantly lower in cases of pathological pregnancies. The patterns observed in inhibition constants extend the biochemical characteristics of the atypical isoenzyme expressed in neutrophils of women with DS pregnancies.
