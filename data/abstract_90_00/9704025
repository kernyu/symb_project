Antileukoprotease (ALP), also known as mucous protease inhibitor or secretory leukoprotease inhibitor, resembles one of the major antiproteases present in human body fluids. It is capable of preventing proteolytic degradation of extracellular matrix proteins by neutrophil-derived serine proteases. ALP was isolated from human callus and detected in supernatants of cultured human primary keratinocytes. ALP mRNA was constitutively expressed in keratinocytes and the expression was not significantly affected by TNF alpha or Interferon gamma stimulation. In microbicidal assays recombinant ALP exhibited antimicrobial activity against several human skin associated microorganisms like P. aeruginosa, S. aureus, S. epidermidis, and C. albicans, indicating that ALP may actively participate in mechanisms allowing homeostasis of bacterial and yeast colonization on human skin. Thus, ALP represents a major soluble serine protease inhibitor and antimicrobial agent expressed in human skin and seems to contribute to the high resistance of the epidermis against proteolysis and infections.
