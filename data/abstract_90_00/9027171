Bacteria of the species S. aureus are characterized by a wide range of signs indicating the inactivation of natural resistance factors, including anticomplement activity, which makes them different from coagulase-negative staphylococci exhibiting only antilysozyme activity. The taxonomic importance of these tests and their possible use for the identification of staphylococcal species are discussed.
