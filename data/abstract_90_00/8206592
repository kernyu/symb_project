We assessed the effect of the vasodilating calcium channel blocker nitrendipine on glucose tolerance in young spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) (n = 15). The nitrendipine group received 1 g/kg chow for 3 weeks. Untreated SHR (n = 14) served as controls. At 3 weeks body weight was comparable, whereas systolic blood pressure was 157 +/- 9 mm Hg in nitrendipine-treated rats versus 191 +/- 10 mm Hg in controls (mean +/- SD, P < .00001). Fasting glucose was 6.8 +/- 2.7 mmol/L in nitrendipine-treated versus 8.9 +/- 1.5 mmol/L in control rats (P < .03). An intravenous glucose tolerance test (300 mg/kg) showed plasma glucose levels at 2, 5, 15, and 30 minutes to be significantly lower in the nitrendipine-treated group versus controls (two-way ANOVA, P < .03). Glucose utilization was estimated by the uptake of [3H]deoxyglucose after its intravenous administration (2 microCi/100 g body wt) to instrumented awake animals. Heart and striated muscle uptake was, respectively, 7983 +/- 5812 and 951 +/- 731 cpm.microL/g.min in the nitrendipine-treated group versus 3532 +/- 2316 and 424 +/- 201 cpm.microL/g.min in controls (P < .02 and P < .04, respectively). [3H]Deoxyglucose plasma half-life and fasting and post-glucose load insulin levels were comparable in the two groups. The results show that nitrendipine improves glucose tolerance by increasing muscle glucose uptake. We suggest that glucose tolerance in SHR is influenced by muscle blood flow and can be improved by vasodilation.
