A total of 404 methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) isolated from pus, CSF, blood and sputum of various hospitalized cases were analyzed. The resistance pattern of these strains were gentamicin (51.8%), erythromycin (80.1%) and co-trimoxazole (89.6%). All these strains were sensitive to vancomycin. The isolation rate was maximum from various surgical specialties (General surgery-28.5%; Neurosurgery-16.3% and Cardio-thoracic unit-10.5%) followed by Children Ward, Premature Nursery and Gynecology Ward, respectively. Use of cloxacillin needs to be restricted since vancomycin, the drug of choice is not available in our country.
