Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a major nosocomial pathogen. Recently, there have been reports of increasing prevalence of MRSA in the community. We here report an outbreak of post operative wound sepsis by MRSA in the surgical ward of LN hospital. A surveillance study for MRSA was undertaken in the corresponding surgical ward, operation theater and OPD and the source of this outbreak was traced to an outdoor patient with community acquired MRSA infection. A total of 320 clinical and environmental samples were screened for MRSA. Seventy (21.8%) S. aureus were obtained, of which 12.8% were resistant to methicillin. 14% of the MRSA infections were from the community. Nasal carriage rates of MRSA in the screened hospital staff and admitted patients were 5.8% and 4.3% respectively. None of the environmental sites sampled yielded MRSA. A study of antibiogram revealed that all the MRSA were uniformly resistant to penicillin, erythromycin, gentamicin, tobramycin and tetracycline and sensitive to vancomycin. All isolates belonged to the same biotype and were nontypable by the standard set of phages.
