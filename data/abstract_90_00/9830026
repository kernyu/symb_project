Cysteine-scanning mutants, E32C to G62C, of the metal-tetracycline/H+ antiporter were constructed in order to precisely determine the membrane topology around putative transmembrane segment II. None of the mutants lost the ability to confer tetracycline resistance, indicating that the cysteine mutation in each mutant did not alter the protein conformation. [14C]N-Ethylmaleimide (NEM) binding to these cysteine mutants in isolated membranes was then investigated. The peptide chain of this region passes through the membrane at least once because residues 36 and 65 are exposed on the outside and inside surfaces of the membrane, respectively (Kimura, T., Ohnuma, M., Sawai, T., and Yamaguchi, A. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 580-585). However, there was no continuous segment in which all of the introduced cysteine residues showed almost no reactivity with [14C]NEM. The proportion of the unbound positions in the second half downstream from position 45 was 55% (10/18), which was clearly higher than that in the first half (21%; 3/14), suggesting that the second half is a transmembrane segment. Positions reactive to NEM appear periodically in the second half. They are located on one side of the helical wheel, suggesting that this side of the transmembrane helix faces a water-filled channel. The cysteine mutants as to the reactive positions in the second half were severely inactivated by NEM except for the P59C mutant, whereas the A40C mutant was the only one inactivated by NEM in the first half. These results suggest that the water-filled channel along this helical region may be a substrate translocation pathway.
