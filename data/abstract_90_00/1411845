Among the 14,528 strains of Neisseria gonorrhoeae isolated from the Government Social Hygiene Sexually Transmitted Disease (STD) Clinics in Hong Kong between 1987 and 1990, there has been a trend toward a decrease in the percentage of penicillin resistant strains in both penicillinase-producing and nonpenicillinase producing N. gonorrhoeae (PPNG and non-PPNG) and an increase in moderate resistant strains, whereas the proportion of sensitive strains has remained stable, except for a small increase in 1990. Presently, PPNG still accounts for 31% of all isolates. In early 1991, 100 consecutive isolates were tested for minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) against 6 commonly used antibiotics. Although ofloxacin has been used as the first-line treatment for gonorrhea for the last 5 years, there is still no sign of in vitro resistance. Two isolates with high-level tetracycline resistance (MIC greater than 16 mg/l) were detected that have not been seen before. Sensitivity to spectinomycin, cefuroxime, and ceftriaxone has also been maintained, and these drugs can probably be recommended as alternative treatments in noncompliant cases. Analysis of location of contact shows an increasing proportion of cases of gonorrhea from overseas, particularly from parts of China. Comparison with the limited information published in the region shows that the population sampled can be very heterogeneous. With the continued flux of international travel, one should be extremely careful when trying to get an accurate assessment of epidemiologic data.
