Seven multiresistant Klebsiella pneumoniae strains isolated in an intensive care unit were studied. Susceptibility to beta-lactams was determined with the E test. Molecular-typing of the isolates was performed by a PCR-based technique (ERIC2-PCR). Sonic cell-extracts were used as beta-lactamase preparations. Beta-lactamase quantities were evaluated measuring nitrocefin hydrolysis. The similarity of the ERIC2-PCR patterns indicated that the seven isolates constituted a single clone. The levels of resistance to oximino-beta-lactams, however, were different. There were indications that the differences in susceptibilities were due, at least partly, to differences in the levels of expression of an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (most likely SHV-5). Related K. pneumoniae isolates may exhibit different levels of resistance to beta-lactams. Therefore, comparison of resistance phenotypes is of limited usefulness in epidemiological investigations of nosocomial infections caused by resistant K. pneumoniae.
