Throughout the past nine years, between 1980 and 1988, we tested 1,205,257 food-handlers as Salmonella carriers in Milan. We isolated 20,286 Salmonella strains with annual average prevalence of 1.68%, fairly costant in recent years. The serotype isolated confirm the prevalence of minor Salmonella, such as S. thypimurium, S. panama, S. anatum, S. london, S. derby, S. infantis, S. heidelberg, S. bredeney, S. braenderup. The frequency of new strains decreased from 15 in 1980 to 1 in 1988 and these were infrequent serogroups. Salmonella strains isolated were generally sensitive to aminoglycoside antibiotics (tobramycin, netilmicin), while they were often resistant to rifampicin, aztreonam, and sometimes to cefuroxime and tetracycline with multiple-resistance.
