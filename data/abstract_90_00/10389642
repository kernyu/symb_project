The worldwide occurrence of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) shows an undiminished prevalence of this serious illness and hospitalisation is common in those patients with severe illness. The diversity of bacterial pathogens that can act as aetiologic agents presents a challenge to initial empiric antimicrobial management. In recent years, treatment has been further complicated by an increased incidence of antibiotic resistance in pathogens such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis. The newly available fluoroquinolones including sparfloxacin offer an alternative approach to empiric management. Sparfloxacin is active against many typical and atypical pathogens, as well as strains resistant to conventional agents. In comparative studies, the in vitro potency of sparfloxacin and its pharmacokinetic profile have been confirmed. The clinical trial efficacy and safety data suggest it might be a useful empiric therapy for both CAP and acute bacterial exacerbation of chronic bronchitis.
