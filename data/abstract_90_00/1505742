Conjugative transfer, in the apparent absence of plasmid DNA, of high-level vancomycin resistance from Enterococcus faecalis NCTC 12201 to Staphylococcus aureus B111 has been demonstrated in vivo and in vitro. Selection of transconjugants on media containing erythromycin or chloramphenicol may result in the transfer of resistance to erythromycin, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, streptomycin and vancomycin though these are capable of separate transfer. Vancomycin resistance has not been transmitted from staphylococcus to staphylococcus though transfer of erythromycin and of chloramphenicol resistance has been achieved.
