The optimal characteristics of agents to treat uncomplicated urinary tract infection must include activity against the major pathogens involved in these infections as well as a low potential for development of bacterial resistance. High urinary levels should be present for an adequate period to eliminate the organisms. Side effects should be minimal with minimal effect on the bacterial flora of the community. Treatment programs of single-dose, three days, or five days can be developed depending upon the agent.
