BACKGROUND: Odontogenic sinusitis is a well-recognized condition that usually is responsive to standard medical and surgical treatment. Current antibiotic therapy recommendations are directed against the usual odontogenic and sinus flora. CASE DESCRIPTION: The authors present a case of a patient with acute sinusitis initiated by a complicated tooth extraction that did not yield readily to standard treatment. The case was complicated by orbital extension of the sinusitis. The authors isolated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, or MRSA, species from the affected sinus that usually is not encountered in uncomplicated acute nonnosocomial or odontogenic sinusitis. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Though such forms of resistant microbial flora as MRSA are rare, they may be seen in patients who have a history of intravenous, or i.v., drug use and in immunocompromised patients. Management of patients with orbital extension of sinusitis requires hospitalization and i.v. antibiotic treatment.
