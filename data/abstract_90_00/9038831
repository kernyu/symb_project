Previous studies showed that cAMP-dependent transepithelial Cl- secretion of the intestinal cell line T84 is reduced by the F-actin stabilizer phalloidin, an effect in part attributable to inhibition of basolateral Na-K-2Cl cotransport. However, secretory responses are preserved in cells treated with the microfilament disrupter cytochalasin D. We explored the effects of cytochalasin D and two novel compounds derived from marine sponges on the Cl- secretory apparatus of T84 cells. Jasplakinolide (which stabilizes F-actin inhibited cAMP-dependent secretion and Na-K-2Cl cotransport. Latrunculin A (which sequesters G-actin monomers) profoundly altered the distribution of F-actin and reduced basal transepithelial resistance with minimal effect on secretion. Cytochalasin D, but not latrunculin A, activated Na-K-2Cl cotransport. The results provide further evidence that vectorial ion transport is influenced by the cytoskeleton and support a model in which disassembly of F-actin by specific pharmacological means or in response to secretory agonists favors activation of Na-K-2Cl cotransport.
