The phenolic acid profiles of six cultivars of wheat with known tolerance to Fusarium head blight were evaluated during plant development from anthesis through maturity. Analysis by HPLC of grain at anthesis revealed that p-coumaric and ferulic acid were the two principal phenolic compounds present. The effect of these two phenolic acids on Fusarium species was evaluated in vitro. Both phenolic acids demonstrated significant reductions (p < 0.05) of Fusarium species growth at all concentrations tested. Ferulic acid is the primary phenolic acid in grain at all stages of development, and its concentration increased steadily during grain development prior to a 50% decrease during grain ripening. The accumulation of ferulic acid synthesis from anthesis until approximately 20 days after anthesis appears related with cultivar resistance to Fusarium. Concentrations of ferulic acid in the grain were similar at maturity, implying that the end-use quality would be similar for both resistant and susceptible cultivars.
