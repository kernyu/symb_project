In pressure sore wounds after spinal cord injury, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus can be detected in 2% of the cases. The elimination of the germ is the aim of the treatment. Pressure sore wounds are an often found complication after spinal cord injury. For local treatment five commercially available antiseptics for the skin and mucous membrane were tested in vitro. The method used is a modified qualitative and quantitative suspension test. The antiseptics were tested without and with addition of 5% albumin in order to simulate the conditions of the wound in vivo. The results show a superior efficacy of the povidone-iodine preparations. Betadine, probably due to the higher concentration, is more efficacious than Braunol; chlorhexidine is sufficiently efficacious without the addition of albumin. These results still have to be confirmed by in vivo studies.
