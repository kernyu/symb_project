A severe episode of Campylobacter jejuni gastroenteritis in a patient with HIV infection was treated with ciprofloxacin and, because of therapeutic failure, subsequently with roxithromycin. After treatment, C. jejuni was again isolated from feces and shown to be resistant to both drugs. We present molecular evidence of the sequential development of both types of resistance in the patient isolate. To our knowledge, this is the first case with documented evidence showing sequential emergence of resistance to fluoroquinolones and erythromycin in a strain of C. jejuni during treatment.
