Vancomycin-resistant enterococci are now found with increasing frequency. Up to now, epidemiological studies of enterococci have been limited by the lack of convenient and accessible methods for comparing strains. In this study, we report an epidemiological investigation on 16 nosocomial vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium strains isolated from 15 patients in four different wards of a children's hospital over a period of 17 months. Analysis of restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) of total DNA and of ribosomal DNA regions (ribotyping) was used as a typing approach. Each strain produced a different total DNA RFLP pattern after HindIII and PvuII digestion, except for two strains that were isolated from a single patient and that gave indistinguishable patterns. In our system, ribotyping was less discriminative than RFLP of total DNA. This approach, therefore, shows the genetic unrelatedness of the nosocomial strains studied and excludes patient-to-patient strain transmission either in the same ward or between wards.
