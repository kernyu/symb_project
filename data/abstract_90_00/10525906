In this experimental study, the effects of an antihelminthic and immunostimulating agent (levamisole) on anastomosis recovery in transfused and normal guinea pigs were investigated. A total of 56 animals were divided into four groups of 14 each; an additional 10 were employed for blood transfusion (BT). Intestinal anastomoses were performed on all animals; the following postoperative treatments were administered: none (control group); BT; intra-abdominal (IA) levamisole; and BT + levamisole. After recording the mortality of each group, a relaparotomy was performed on one-half of the animals on the 3rd postoperative day and on the remaining half on the 7th postoperative day. Findings of IA sepsis, resistance of the anastomosis, bursting pressure, and hydroxyproline values were evaluated. Statistical comparison of the groups was accomplished by analysis of variance. In the transfused group an increase in sepsis was determined and the bursting pressure was significantly lower than in the control group. IA levamisole application following BT reduced the mortality by diminishing IA sepsis and anastomotic abscess formation and increased anastomotic pressure and recovery (P < 0.01). Histopathologic recovery in levamisole groups was better than in the group that received BT only. Levamisole application without BT resulted in equal mortality and morbidity to that of the control group. We conclude that clinical use of levamisole should be considered only in intestinal anastomoses in which BT is inevitable.
