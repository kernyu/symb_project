A case-control study was performed in a community-based nonteaching hospital to assess patient risk factors for the acquisition of fluoroquinolone-resistant isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Fifty-five patients who were hospitalized between July 1, 1993 and December 31, 1993 and who had P. aeruginosa recovered from a clinical specimen were included in the analysis. Two patient populations were designated based on the fluoroquinolone susceptibility of their P. aeruginosa isolates. Statistical evaluation using univariate analysis of demographic and clinical data from the 42 patients with quinolone-susceptible P. aeruginosa and the 13 patients with quinolone-resistant P. aeruginosa demonstrated that prior receipt of a fluoroquinolone was the only significant risk factor for the subsequent emergence of fluoroquinolone resistance among P. aeruginosa isolated from patients hospitalized in this small community-based institution (p = 0.0196). Multivariate analysis supported the finding that prior receipt of a fluoroquinolone was the major risk factor for the isolation of fluoroquinolone-resistant P. aeruginosa (p = 0.0004); isolation of this Gram-negative bacillus from sputum (p = 0.0306) and a history of recent surgery (p = 0.0058) were also significantly associated as risk factors for resistance.
