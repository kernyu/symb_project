The authors report a case of a 32-year-old patient who has been treated for idiopathic proctitis for 10 years. The inflammation did not react to Salazopyrin and corticosteroid therapy. Significant stenosis has developed. The probability of Chlamydia infection has emerged because of the atypical morphological appearance and therapy resistance of the process. The Chlamydia infection was verified by serological examinations and direct immunofluorescent detection of the pathogen taken from biopsy specimen. The proctitis has been cured by Doxycyclin and roxithromycin therapy. The authors call attention to the different diagnostic significance of the disease considering that strictures requiring surgical operation can develop in cases being unrecognised and treated inadequately. The case is the first report of the disease in Hungary.
