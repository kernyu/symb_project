Culture and sensitivity data were collected on over 500 isolates from indwelling urinary catheters in 23 Nebraska long-term care facilities. Four percent of all nursing home patients had indwelling urinary catheters. The prevalence of bacteriuria in catheterized patients was 79%., and the most frequent isolates were E. coli, Proteus mirabilis, and Enterococcus species. Thirteen percent of catheterized patients were receiving systemic antibiotics, and 85% had at least one urinary bacterial isolate resistant to the antibiotic being administered. Antibiotic resistance correlated positively with a number of factors in the long-term care institutions, including size and skill level.
