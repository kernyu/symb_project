The stunning clinical benefit of antiretroviral therapy is associated with long-term viral suppression. Treatment failure has therefore been defined as incomplete suppression of viral replication, however, in clinical practice success is also seen in a substantial proportion of patients with ongoing viral replication, a phenomenon which is not understood at this time. The main reason for treatment failure is the development of resistance due to the inability of many patients to comply with the daunting challenge of the complex antiretroviral therapy. An "era of compliance" is now necessary to sustain and expand the benefits of these therapies.
