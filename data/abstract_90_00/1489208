Cefaclor sustained its inhibitory activity against a beta-lactamase-producing strain of Haemophilus influenzae. Although a relatively high permeability coefficient was calculated for ampicillin compared with that calculated for cefaclor, the resulting periplasmic concentration of cefaclor was 5.7 times that of ampicillin. The efficacy of cefaclor may be due to its higher beta-lactamase resistance, which allows it to achieve a greater periplasmic concentration and adequate binding to crucial penicillin-binding proteins.
