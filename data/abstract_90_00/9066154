The in vitro susceptibility of three clinical Trichophyton rubrum isolates to griseofulvin and tioconazole, determined by the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC), was 2 and 0.5 to 1.0 micrograms/ml, respectively. One mutant (gril) obtained after mutagenic treatment of one of these isolates was selected and showed simultaneous resistance to griseofulvin (MIC > 2000 micrograms/ml) and tioconazole (MIC = 1.0 microgram/ml). The clinical importance and the possibility of a multidrug resistance (MDR)-type mechanism being involved in this event is discussed.
