BACKGROUND: Cytomegalovirus (CMV) has been implicated as an exacerbating agent in the development of transplant vascular sclerosis; however, specific etiologic mechanisms remain unresolved. Based upon our previous observations that CMV-infected endothelial cells (ECs) stimulate proliferation and cytokine production by allogeneic T cells, we now test the hypothesis that CMV-driven cytolytic activity may contribute to graft endothelial injury. METHODS: Limiting dilutions of CMV-seropositive or -seronegative donor-derived T cells were stimulated with CMV-infected or uninfected allogeneic ECs in the presence of interleukin-2. T-cell proliferation was monitored by assay of [3H]thymidine incorporation and stimulated T cells were tested for lytic activity against CMV-infected or uninfected radiolabeled EC targets by 51Cr release assay. Natural killer (NK) cell activity was examined by incubating freshly isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells with 51Cr-labeled targets, followed by assay of radiolabel release. RESULTS: CMV-infected ECs were resistant to T cell- and NK-mediated cytolysis regardless of donor serostatus, nature of stimulation, or level of T-cell proliferation. In contrast, although uninfected ECs were unharmed by NK cells, these targets experienced significant lysis by T cells stimulated with either uninfected or CMV-infected ECs. CONCLUSIONS: These results implicate CMV-infected graft endothelium as a persistent source of infectious virus, a chronic stimulus for potentially destructive host inflammatory activity, and a potential trigger for the generation of lytic injury to uninfected bystander endothelia, suggesting multiple mechanisms by which this virus might perturb equilibrium at the graft/host interface.
