Because of increasing reports of multiple-antibiotic-resistant strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae and associated clinical failures, this study was performed to determine the prevalence of multiresistance among strains from nine Louisiana medical centers. Using a National Committee for Laboratory Standards broth microdilution method, 481 strains were tested. Of these, 70% were penicillin-susceptible (PS), 23% had intermediate minimum inhibitory concentration values to penicillin (I), and 7% were fully resistant to penicillin (PR). The isolation rates (15% to 40% for I strains and 0% to 33% for PR strains) at the various medical centers varied appreciably. The prevalence of penicillin resistance was highest among upper respiratory isolates, while cross-resistance to other antimicrobials varied. The least cross-resistance was noted among PS strains. However, strains with reduced penicillin susceptibility had high levels of cross-resistance. Among I strains, the prevalence of cross-resistance (%) was noted for amoxicillin/clavulanate (6%), cefuroxime (71%), cefaclor (91%), ceftriaxone (13%), cefotaxime (34%), erythromycin (67%), azithromycin (32%), and clarithromycin (32%). For PR strains, the prevalence of cross-resistance was 97% for amoxicillin/clavulanate, cefuroxime, and cefaclor; 67% for ceftriaxone and erythromycin; 89% for cefotaxime; and 69% for azithromycin and clarithromycin. These data emphasize the high prevalence of multiple-antimicrobial-resistance among strains of S pneumoniae with reduced penicillin susceptibility in this geographic area.
