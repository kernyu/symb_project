Macrolide resistance in disseminated Mycobacterium avium infection is of major concern in AIDS patients as these drugs represent the main component of combination therapy. Clarithromycin and azithromycin should not be used alone for the treatment and prophylaxis of the disease because of the risk of selecting resistant strains. We report the case of a clarithromycin resistant disseminated M. avium infection in an AIDS patient, acquired after long term monotherapy with clarithromycin for the treatment of cryptosporidiosis.
