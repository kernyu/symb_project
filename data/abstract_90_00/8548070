Antibioticograms of different campylobacteria strains have been analyzed. It is shown possible to develop a system of epidemiological marking on this basis. With this purpose sensitivity of campylobacteria to gentamycin, canamycin, carbenicyllin, tetracylin and erythromycin has been studied. No statistical difference in the average markers of resistance in the studied groups of strains was observed. This permitted supposing that R-plasmids in "human" strains may be isolated not only from the human intestine microflora, but also from other sources (animals, birds, environmental objects) as well. There are found common R-spectra in different groups of strains (Gm Kb Tc Er; Kb and Kb Tc), which confirms the same infection source. The study of antibioticograms of campylobacteria which circulate among people, animals, birds and environmental objects permits revealing regularities of epidemic process in case of campylobacteriosis.
