A similar number of adults and children had invasive pneumococcal infection. There was male predominance, and different ethnic distribution between children and adults. The majority of adults (78%), had underlying diseases, but this was less frequent in children (24%). The presenting illness differed between adults and children. Complications of invasive pneumococcal infection occurred more frequently in adults than in children. The mortality rate in adults was 21.5%; in children, only 3.8%. The rate of penicillin-resistant pneumococci at our hospital was 23%, while cefotaxime resistance was 4.2%. Penicillin-resistant pneumococci were not isolated more frequently from children than from adults. Patients with penicillin-resistant pneumococci had longer duration of hospitalization and more nosocomially acquired infections. No difference in the mortality rate was found between patients with resistant or sensitive pneumococci. Ninety-five percent of strains were included in the current vaccine, but less than 2% of patients had been vaccinated. Isolates prevalent in Europe and the United States (19, 5, 1, 14, 6, 18, 12, 4, 9, 23, 7) were also most prevalent in Jerusalem. The distribution of serotypes differed between children and adults, and between patients from whom resistant organisms were isolated as opposed to sensitive organisms.
