The in vitro antibacterial activity of DU-6859a, a new fluoroquinolone, against a wide variety of clinical isolates was evaluated and compared with those of tosufloxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and sparfloxacin. DU-6859a showed potent broad-spectrum activity against gram-positive, gram-negative, and anaerobic bacteria, and its activity was greater than those of the control quinolones. By comparison of MICs at which 90% of strains are inhibited, DU-6859a had potent activity against bacteria resistant to the control quinolones. The time-killing curves of quinolones showed that the number of viable cells decreased rapidly during 2 to 4 of incubation, and regrowth was not seen even after 8 h incubation. At a concentration of four times the MIC, the frequencies of appearance of spontaneous mutants of Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa resistant to DU-6859a were < or = 4.0 x 10(-9) to 1.9 x 10(-8). The 50% inhibitory concentrations of DU-6859a were 0.86 and 1.05 micrograms/ml for the supercoiling activities of DNA gyrases isolated from E. coli and P. aeruginosa, respectively. The rank order of the 50% inhibitory concentrations observed for both DNA gyrases roughly paralleled the MICs.
