Treatment of gastrointestinal infections continues to be complicated by expanding resistance to antibiotics. This has led to both new antibiotic treatments and to research on alternative therapies. In the case of Clostridium difficile colitis, interesting preliminary results have been obtained with both probiotic therapy and passive immunization strategies. The newer macrolides were found to be effective for multidrug-resistant Salmonella typhi and safe in the pediatric population. The efficacy of rifaximin, a nonabsorbed antimicrobial agent, was demonstrated in the treatment of travelers diarrhea in Mexico. The benefit of the proteolytic agent bromelain, which degrades enterocyte receptors for enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, was shown in an experimental model of piglets challenged with this infection after bromelain prophylaxis. The potential value of zinc supplementation in infant diarrhea was shown in a study in India. The recently approved rotavirus vaccine is being withheld because of multiple reported cases of intussusception. Cryptosporidiosis continues to challenge old and new chemotherapeutic agents. The usefulness of paromomycin in Cryptosporidium infection was shown in both murine and piglet models. The cost effectiveness of prophylaxis for parasitosis in immigrants has been an area of investigation.
