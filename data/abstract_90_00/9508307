Phenotypic heterogeneity among isolates of Eubacterium lentum has been recognized for many years. To better delineate their taxonomic relatedness, 29 clinical isolates of E. lentum were examined for soluble-protein content, cellular fatty acid profile, and antimicrobial resistance pattern in order to ascertain whether differences in these characteristics could be correlated with differences in biochemical activities. Among 29 isolates we could identify 6 that were different from all the others. These strains were coccobacilli with translucent colonies; they were catalase and H2S negative, not fluorescent under UV light, and susceptible to beta-lactam drugs; growth was not stimulated by arginine; and fatty acid analysis revealed the presence of straight-chain fatty acids. The remainder of the strains, including the type species, were pleomorphic bacilli with speckled colonies and were catalase and H2S positive; all but two were fluorescent under UV light; they were resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics; growth was greatly stimulated by arginine; and they demonstrated saturated branched-chain fatty acids. Our data suggest that E. lentum can be further differentiated into different types.
