We characterized 21 strains of serotype 23F Streptococcus pneumoniae isolated in various countries with various levels of penicillin susceptibility by penicillin-binding protein (PBP) gene fingerprinting and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Pneumococci isolated in Israel, Hungary, Bulgaria, Slovakia, Rumania, France, the United States, Spain and Japan were included. These strains were classified into 12 and 18 groups by PBP gene fingerprinting and PFGE, respectively. Some of the pneumococci isolated in Spain, the United States and France appeared to be genetically related by PFGE, showed the same PBP gene pattern and had similar antimicrobial susceptibility patterns. One penicillin-susceptible Bulgarian strain, with a similar PFGE pattern but a different fingerprinting pattern, may be an ancestral recipient strain that became transformed into the resistant variants. Rumanian and Israeli strains were also genetically related by PFGE. These results indicate the existence of widely spread but related pneumococci in the world. PBP 2X gene profiles of pneumococci with MICs of 0.25 microg/ml were different from each other and from penicillin-susceptible pneumococci (PSP). PBP 2B gene profiles of these resistant strains were identical. PBP 2B gene profiles of pneumococci (penicillin MICs >/=0.5 microg/ml) were different from PSP. PBP gene profiles may not only be useful for genetic analysis but also for presumed penicillin susceptibility.
