The effect of animal myeloperoxidase (EC 1.11.1.7) on the viability of a plant pathogen was determined. Lethality of hydrogen peroxide to germinating spores of Aspergillus flavus increased 90-fold enzymically. Singlet oxygen was present but hypochlorite accounted for two-thirds of the increase. The results indicate myeloperoxidase could improve microbial resistance in plants, perhaps transgenically.
