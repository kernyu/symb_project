Cephalosporins are among the most frequently prescribed antibiotics as a result of their broad spectrum of microbiologic activity, favorable pharmacokinetics, low incidence of adverse reactions, and proven clinical efficacy for a wide variety of infections. Cephalosporins differ in their gram-positive, gram-negative, and anaerobic spectra, serum half-lives, penetration of the cerebrospinal fluid, and resistance to beta-lactamases. The first-generation and some second-generation agents maintain excellent activity against streptococci and staphylococci, while the third-generation agents have expanded gram-negative coverage. Two third-generation cephalosporins, ceftazidime and cefoperazone, are active against Pseudomonas. Ceftizoxime has become the workhorse third-generation cephalosporin. The fourth-generation agent cefepime provides excellent activity against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens, including antibiotic-resistant Enterobacteriaceae. A major dilemma facing the practitioner is how to select the "right" cephalosporin for a particular patient, as no one drug will satisfy all clinical needs. This review describes a practical approach to selecting an appropriate cephalosporin for common infectious disease problems.
