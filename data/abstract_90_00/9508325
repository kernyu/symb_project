Fecal samples from 200 consecutive patients admitted to a community hospital yielded 107 enterococci. High-level gentamicin resistance occurred in 10 (14%) of the Enterococcus faecalis isolates. Ampicillin resistance occurred in two (3%) of the E. faecalis isolates and six (23%) of the Enterococcus faecium isolates. There were no vancomycin-resistant enterococci. Risk factors for enterococci with high-level aminoglycoside (gentamicin) or ampicillin resistance included prior hospitalization and previous antibiotic use.
