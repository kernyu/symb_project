Hepatitis B virus (HBV) drug resistance to lamivudine is always accompanied by mutations in the viral polymerase gene at position 550, termed group 1 (M550V with L526M) or group 2 (M550I) mutations. The latter mutation has not been associated with famciclovir resistance. Thus, the addition of famciclovir to lamivudine therapy in persons with group 2 lamivudine resistance may lead to virus suppression. The effect of lamivudine/famciclovir combination therapy on HBV infection was monitored in 5 lamivudine-resistant patients by quantitative polymerase chain reaction and polymerase gene sequencing of serum virus. No patients treated with combination therapy had a decline in HBV load >1 log10. Continual evolution of the viral polymerase was detected in association with virologic resistance to both drugs. Cloning experiments identified the preexistence of these multidrug-resistant virus variants as minority species prior to addition of famciclovir therapy. HBV resistance to lamivudine monotherapy is associated with a complex mixture of variants that limit the efficacy of second-line nucleoside-analogue therapy. First-line potent combination therapy may reduce the emergence of HBV drug resistance.
