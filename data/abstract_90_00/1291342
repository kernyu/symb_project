In a malaria-endemic area of Orissa, wherein chloroquine has been in use for over thirty years, 58.3% (14/24) P. falciparum cases did not respond to single dose chloroquine (10 mg base/kg) in in-vivo test. With standard dose (25 mg base/kg) 31.2% cases (10/32) showed resistance, i.e. at RI (15.6%), RII (9.4%) and RIII (6.2%) levels. Standard dose was superior in response to the single dose therapy [p < 0.05; chi 2 (df 1) = 4.11]. Out of eight isolates tested in vitro, two showed resistance to chloroquine, five to sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine (SP) but all were sensitive to amodiaquine, quinine and mefloquine. Whereas the standard dose of chloroquine would be a better option in general, in resistant cases, SP, quinine and mefloquine offer an alternative drug choice. The implications of drug resistance in a malaria-control programme and the need to revise drug policy in India are discussed.
