OBJECTIVE: Review the epidemiology of fungal infections, approved susceptibility testing methods, the scope of antifungal resistance, and advances in the treatment of fungal infections. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE databases (from 1966 to March 1998) were searched for literature pertaining to the epidemiology and management of fungal infections. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Articles were selected to assist in providing the reader an understanding of the epidemiology and management of fungal infections. DATA SYNTHESIS: Fungi have emerged as an important class of pathogens. Even though fungi rank as the fourth most commonly encountered nosocomial bloodstream pathogen, and are associated with the highest mortality of commonly encountered pathogens, only within the past year have methods for conducting and guidelines for interpreting in vitro susceptibility tests been approved. Under the guidance of these standards, we have begun to understand important issues regarding fungi such as the scope and mechanisms of antifungal resistance. Although there has not been a significant addition to our antifungal armamentarium since 1992, advances in antifungal therapy have been realized with the reformulation of available agents and the delineation of the pharmacodynamic characteristics of several antifungals. Additionally, several new agents, including a new class of antifungals, probably will enter into clinical use within the next 5 years. CONCLUSIONS: We have entered an era in which our understanding of fungi is increasing tremendously. Clinicians need to familiarize themselves with the current concepts surrounding the management of fungal infections in order to provide optimal care for their patients.
