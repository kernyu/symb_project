Herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections are prevalent worldwide. HSV are characterized by their ability to establish and maintain latent infections that can be reactivated. Various clinical presentations of HSV infections are described. Mostly asymptomatic, these infections may become life-threatening when occurring in neonates or when infecting the central nervous system. Accurate diagnosis of HSV infections is important and PCR is the most sensitive technique for detecting HSV. Type-specific serologies could be particularly useful for seroprevalence rates. Aciclovir is an efficient drug for the treatment of herpes simplex virus infections and resistance to this drug has been reported mainly in immunocompromised patients during the course of aciclovir treatment. There is a variety of potential vaccines for prophylaxis of HSV infection, but no vaccine is now available.
