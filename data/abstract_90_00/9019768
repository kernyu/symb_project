M. tuberculosis examined in 717 patients with pulmonary tuberculosis appeared resistant to chemotherapy in 67.2% of cases. Whereas chronic patients developed drug resistance (DR) as secondary DR in 90.2% of cases, new cases with DR (50.1% of the examinees) seemed to be infected with drug-resistant M. tuberculosis. 2-stage chemotherapy with 4-5 drugs terminates bacterial discharge within first 3 months of treatment in the majority of the patients, especially if early correction of chemotherapy is used by the results of early determination M. tuberculosis drug sensitivity.
