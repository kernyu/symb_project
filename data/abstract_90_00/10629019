The non-naturally occurring TEM-1 beta-lactamase mutant R164S:G238S, as well as the R164S (TEM-12) and G238S (TEM-19) beta-lactamases, were constructed and expressed in Escherichia coli under isogenic conditions. Comparison of susceptibilities to beta-lactam antibiotics and substrate profiles showed that the combination of R164S with G238S drastically reduced the extended-spectrum activity of the respective single mutants.
