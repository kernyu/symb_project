There is no doubt about 2-CDA being a very potent lymphotoxic agent that displays high efficacy in the treatment of CLL. It interferes with the intranuclear machinery of DNA regulation, and causes death to proliferative active, as well as resting lymphocytes. Interruption of crucial pathways that are evident for cell survival translates into high clinical response rates in CLL. CR and PR rates comparable to those reported on fludarabine are achieved in relapsed or refractory CLL. Even though trials on previously untreated CLL are still ongoing, a consistent trend towards durable, high CR rates becomes apparent. The toxicity is comparable to that of fludarabine and consists of infections, as well as thrombocytopenia. Clinical as well as in vitro studies suggest a crossresistance between the two purine analogues, indicating that sequential treatment is not useful. Given these data, although preliminary in case of de novo CLL, 2-CDA has to be recognized as one of the most effective cytostatic drugs currently available for CLL treatment. Large prospective trials (in comparison with fludarabine) will assess the role of 2-CDA as standard treatment. Such trials should also have the aim to substantiate the potential of 2-CDA as induction treatment followed by high-dose consolidation.
