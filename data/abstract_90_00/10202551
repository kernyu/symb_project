The role of physico-chemical rearrangements in the cell plasmalemma of Acholeplasma laidlawii in the development of resistance to tetracycline was investigated. The cells of A.laidlawii were shown to be tolerant to tetracycline and to preserve a rather high titre of the cells even at a concentration of the antibiotic in the inoculation medium much higher than the MIC. The results of the investigation of the structural rearrangements in the plasmatic membrane of the cells grown in the presence of tetracycline revealed changes in the lipid flow in the surface layer and an increase in the cholesterol and phospholipid contents. The size of the changes depended on the time of tetracycline addition and the phase of the culture growth.
