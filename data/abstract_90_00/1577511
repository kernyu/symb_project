Of a total of 730 strains of S. typhi isolated in 1989-90, in the Medical College Hospital, Rohtak (India), 218 isolates showed resistance to chloramphenicol, ampicillin and cotrimoxazole. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for ampicillin and cotrimoxazole was up to 3200 micrograms/ml, intermediate for chloramphenicol (200-800 micrograms/ml) and low for tetracycline (50-400 micrograms/ml). A significant observation was prevalence of E1 as the predominant phage type amongst resistant strains accounting for 88.8 per cent of the resistant isolates, 95.8 per cent of these showed block resistance to ACCoT.
