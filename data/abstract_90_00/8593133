This study describes the influence of bioptivet GB on minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) for oxytetracycline (OTC) of the intestinal E. coli flora of young broiler chickens after oral administration at a dosage equivalent to a prophylactic course of treatment. From day 6 until day 15 one group of 50 birds received a diet containing 124 ppm OTC, another group of 75 birds served as non medicated control. Investigated E. coli had been isolated from cloacal swabs and from caecal contents. MIC of 1581 E. coli strains were determined by agar dilution test procedures. MIC of OTC for the investigated strains were either > or = 128 micrograms/ml (resistant) or < or = 4 micrograms/ml (susceptible). Even from undosed birds resistant strains were isolated frequently, especially from samples of caecal contents. Administration of bioptivet GB resulted in a statistically significant increase in the average MIC. Statistically higher average MIC were recorded among isolates from cloacal swabs only during application of the drug. For strains from caecal contents this could be demonstrated until the end of the experiment.
