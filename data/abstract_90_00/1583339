Systemic fusarial infections have emerged as a significant cause of mortality in cancer patients. Yet, little is known about the management of these infections. The in vivo antifungal activity of amphotericin B in CF1 mice with disseminated fusarial infections was studied. Two pathogenic strains of Fusarium solani were used. Intraperitoneal administration of amphotericin B in daily doses of 0.5, 1, and 2 mg/kg for less than or equal to 10 days did not prolong survival of treated animals. Clearance of F. solani from kidneys was similar in mice treated with 1 mg/kg per day of amphotericin B and in untreated animals. These results are in agreement with the known in vitro and in vivo resistance of Fusarium species to amphotericin B.
