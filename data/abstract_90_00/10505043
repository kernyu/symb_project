We used the gemcitabine (dFdC) and cisplatin (cis-diamine dichloroplatinum CDDP) resistant murine NSCLC tumour Lewis Lung (LL) in C57/B16 mice to optimise scheduling of both drugs, since in previous in vivo studies no effective combination schedule of both compounds was found to overcome resistance to either drug. dFdC could not be combined at the previously determined maximum tolerated dose (MTD) (120 mg/kg, q3dx4) with CDDP at its MTD (9 mg/kg, q6dx2) (mean weight loss < 15% and < 15% toxic deaths), because of additive toxicity. Therefore, we lowered the dose of dFdC to 60 mg/kg (q3dx4) and of CDDP to 3 mg/kg (q6dx2), which caused an increase in antitumour effect compared with the activity of each compound alone at its MTD (growth delay factor (GDF) = 0.55, 0.13 and 2.56 for dFdC and CDDP alone and the combination, respectively). Changing the CDDP treatment schedule giving the total dose (6 mg/kg) only at day 0 caused unacceptable toxicity. This effect was not seen when mice were treated with the total dose of CDDP on day 9, but, the anti-tumour effect was not enhanced. To decrease toxicity, the dosage of dFdC was lowered to 50 mg/kg and combined with the total dose of CDDP on day 0, which caused a better antitumour effect than the combination of 60 mg/kg dFdC and 3 mg/kg CDDP (q6dx2) with acceptable toxicity. Schedule dependency was found for the combination: dFdC preceding CDDP by 4 h was the best treatment schedule in the LL tumours (GDF: 2.1) with acceptable toxicity. However, when the interval was increased to 24 h, toxicity became unacceptable (> 30% weight loss). The reverse schedule, in which CDDP preceded dFdC, did not lead to an increased antitumour effect or to increased toxicity. Adding amifostine, a selective chemoprotector, to the treatment decreased toxicity of the combination without affecting the antitumour effect. Increasing the CDDP dose to 9 mg/kg (day 0) under amifostine protection led to an improved therapeutic index.
