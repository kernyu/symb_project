In the absence of a suitable malaria case definition, reliable surveillance data on the impact of malaria are not available. Determinants of case loads, including population movements, environmental changes, lack of political commitment and resources, and resistance to antimalarials and residual insecticides, work towards global deterioration. Some 90% of the Plasmodium falciparum burden is carried by Africa south of the Sahara. There, in 1992, the number of children under five years of age and exposed to high risk was about 106 million. Assuming a malaria attack rate of 0.5-1.5 per child per year, and a case fatality rate of 2%, annual clinical cases and malaria deaths in this population alone come to 53-160 million and 1-3 million, respectively. Roche, a pharmaceutical company with major research efforts in tropical medicine, in collaboration with research centers and international institutions, has recently set up a tropical medicine unit that coordinates and concentrates corporate efforts in this field. The unit aims to make affordable and innovative products available which are effective against major tropical diseases. A commercial product of the unit is Lariam, a major antimalarial used alone or in simultaneous or sequential combinations. The single dose combination of Lariam plus Fansidar (Fansimef) is particularly useful for stand-by or emergency oral therapy. Artemisinine, or its derivatives, followed by one to two doses of Lariam are effective against severe and multiresistant P. falciparum malaria. A new Roche peroxide antimalarial is currently in phase II clinical trials. The unit is also involved in research and development of malaria sporozoite and asexual blood stage vaccine candidates.
