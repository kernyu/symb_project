Pulmonary mycobacteriosis is usually caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Mycobacterium avium complex, or Mycobacterium kansasii. There are, however, other slow-growing mycobacteria which can cause pulmonary infection. Mycobacterium szulgai, first reported in 1972, is a scotochromogenic species which can affect human lungs, although human-to-human spread of infection is thought to be unlikely. We have recently treated three cases of middle-aged to elderly persons (45-87 year-old), two of them had underlying diseases (one with intrapulmonary and the other with extrapulmonary). All patients had constitutional symptoms (cough, sputum, dyspnea), and chest roentgenograms demonstrated either cavitation with scattered nodules or peripheral infiltrates predominantly in upper lobes, resembling pulmonary tuberculosis. In two cases, M. szulgai was identified by using DNA-DNA hybridization method. The in vitro susceptibility of M. szulgai to antimycobacterial drugs was better than that of M. avium complex, and it was resistant only to paraaminosalicylate, cycloserine, and partially to isoniazid. Pulmonary disease of three patients were successfully treated with a combination of multiple antimycobacterial agents including rifampin, ethambutol, isoniazid, or streptomycin.
