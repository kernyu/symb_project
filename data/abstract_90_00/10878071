The MIKADO trial was designed to evaluate the efficacy of stavudine-zalcitabine-saquinavir (soft gel capsule) [d4T-ddC-SQV(SGC)] in 36 naive patients (-3.3 log(10) units at week 24 [W24]). Among the 29 patients remaining on d4T-ddC-SQV(SGC) until W24, 10 harbored a virological failure (viral load of >200 copies/ml at W24) (group 1). To determine the reasons for therapeutic failure, genotypic and phenotypic resistance test results and SQV concentrations in plasma were analyzed and compared to those in successfully treated patients (viral load of <200 copies/ml at W24) (group 2). Reverse transcriptase and protease genotypic analyses in group 1 revealed the acquisition of only one SQV-associated mutation (L90M) in only two patients. There was no significant increase in the 50 or 90% inhibitory concentration of SQV in patients with or without the L90M mutation. However, the fact that two patients developed an L90M mutation only 4 weeks after relapse points to the need for genotypic resistance testing in the context of an initial failure of the antiretroviral regimen. At W24, the median SQV concentration in group 1 (71 ng/ml) was significantly lower than in group 2 (475 ng/ml), and the plasma SQV concentration was correlated with the viral load at W24 (r = -0.5; P<0.05) and with the drop in viral load between day 0 and W24 (r = -0.5; P<0.01). These results and the fact that the plasma SQV concentrations in the two groups prior to relapse (W12) were not significantly different strongly suggest that the early failure of this combination is not due to viral resistance but to a lack of compliance, pharmacological variability, and drug interactions or a combination of these factors.
