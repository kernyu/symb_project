Buffered solutions of iodine (pH 7.0) were effective against Bacillus subtilis spores, but concentrations and contact times for effective sporicidal action were relatively high. Concentrations of 500 to 1000 ppm available iodine with a contact time of 30-45 min were required to produce a 3-5 log reduction. Treatment of spores with agents which caused progressive extraction of coat protein and cortex hexosamine was associated with increased sensitivity to iodine. Treatment of spores with iodine produced extraction of spore coat protein which was potentiated in the presence of NaOH, but there was no evidence of breakdown of cortex hexosamines or release of dipicolinic acid, either from intact spores or spore protoplasts. Sporicidal concentrations of iodine stimulated the uptake of (32P) phosphate over an initial period of 30-40 min, but phosphate then leaked from the cells; 1000 ppm available iodine produced total loss within 60 min. Results of this investigation are consistent with previous findings which suggest that the resistance of spores to biocides is related to the barrier properties of the spore outer layers and that the sporicidal action of halogen-releasing agents is related to their ability to cause coat and cortex degradation, leading to rehydration of the spore protoplast and allowing diffusion to their site of action on the underlying protoplast.
