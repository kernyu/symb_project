The glycopeptide susceptibility of 443 clinical isolates of gram-positive cocci collected from nine general hospitals in 1996 was determined according to the recommendations of the CA-SFM (the Antibiogram Committee of the French Society for Microbiology). In total, 234 isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, 84 isolates of coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), 98 enterococci and 27 streptococci were collected. The mecA gene confirming resistance to methicillin was found in 42.7% of S. aureus isolates and 51.2% of CNS isolates. No resistance to teicoplanin and vancomycin was found in S. aureus but four isolates of CNS had an MIC of teicoplanin > or = 8 mg/L. All isolates of Enterococcus faecalis tested were susceptible to both glycopeptides. This study confirms that teicoplanin has a very good in vitro activity against gram-positive cocci, isolated in France from nosocomial infections.
