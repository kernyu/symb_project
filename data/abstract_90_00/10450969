Penicillin sulfones, which structurally incorporate both a 6-position alkylidene substituent and a 2'beta substituent, have been synthesized and evaluated as inhibitors of class C and class A serine beta-lactamases. Incorporation of the 2'beta-substituent generally improves inhibitory activity. Substituents that improve transport across the bacterial cell membrane have also been incorporated.
