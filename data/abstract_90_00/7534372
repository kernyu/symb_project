The tylosin producer Streptomyces fradiae contains four known resistance genes, two of which (tlrA and tlrD) encode methyltransferases that act on ribosomal RNA at a common site. Expression of tlrA is regulated via transcriptional attenuation. A short transcript, only 411 nucleotides long, terminates 27 nucleotides into the methylase-coding sequence in the uninduced state. Induction of tlrA is proposed to involve a ribosome-mediated conformational change within the mRNA leader that allows transcription to continue beyond the attenuation site, resulting in a transcript about 1450 nucleotides long. Transplantation of tlrD and/or tlrA into Streptomyces albus revealed that the induction specificity of tlrA depends upon the state of the ribosomes and is significantly altered in strains also expressing tlrD.
