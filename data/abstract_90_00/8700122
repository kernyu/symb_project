Since the discovery of human immunodeficiency retrovirus, the drug arsenal against retrovirus has rapidly increased. Concomitantly, new challenges in the therapy of acquired immune deficiency syndrome have arisen, including drug toxicities, drug resistance, and the development of various cancers as effective therapies prolong survival. Tamoxifen, a nonsteroidal antiestrogen with a low incidence of side effects, is widely used in cancer therapy; it is known to exert pleiotropic activities by binding essentially to the estrogen receptor and other unidentified proteins. In the present work, quantification of the p24 core protein of human immunodeficiency virus 1 produced by infected lymphocytes shows an inhibitory effect of tamoxifen on virion production. Moreover, we assume that this effect is not mediated by the estrogen receptor because antiestrogen ligands interacting with the antiestrogen-binding site exhibit efficacy related to their affinity for this site, although specific antiestrogens of the estrogen receptor are ineffective.
