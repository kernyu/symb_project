A total of 62 salmonellae, belonging to six different serotypes, were isolated from 60 out of 87 (69.0%) chicken carcasses delivered to hospitals of Thessaloniki, Greece. Salmonella enteritidis, Salmonella anatum and Salmonella bredeney were the most prevalent serovars. Isolates were examined for antibiotic resistance patterns and R-determinants. Resistance to at least one antibiotic was observed in 36 (58.1%) of them and 18 different resistant profiles were recorded. Nitrofurantoin-resistance was the most common (29.0%), followed by spectinomycin (21.0%), ampicillin (19.4%) and ticarcillin (19.4%). Fourteen (38.9%) of the resistant isolates possessed R-factors and resistance to ampicillin, ticarcillin, trimethoprim and kanamycin was easily self-transferable. However, nitrofurantoin- and spectinomycin-resistance although prevailing, was not found transferable even after mobilization. The high incidence of antibiotic resistant salmonellae among chicken carcasses in our hospital setting suggests the need for public health interventions and possible withdrawal of drug selective pressure.
