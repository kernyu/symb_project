Cotyledons, each with a 1-2 mm petiole at its base, were cut from axenic seedlings and infected with Agrobacterium tumefaciens. After 2-3 days of cocultivation, the cotyledon explants were transferred to MS selection medium containing 15 mg/L kanamycin and 4.5 mg/L 6-BA to induce shoot differentiation. Kanamycin-resistant shoots were subcultured on selection medium with 20-50 mg/L kanamycin for 3-6 months for eliminating escaped non-transformants, and then rooted on MS medium containing 25 mg/L kanamycin and 0.1 mg/L NAA. Whole plants were transplanted into soil and grew in the field. DNA Southern blot hybridization and polymerase chain reaction showed that some of the plants were positive when probed with the insecticidal crystal protein gene. The transgenic plants exhibited tolerant to pest insects such as Laphygma exigua and Pieris rapae in leaf feeding experiments Kanamycin-resistance and insect-resistance were maintained in the progeny. The foreign genes were delivered to the progeny according to Mendelian Law of single gene segregation.
