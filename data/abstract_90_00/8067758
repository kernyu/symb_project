The in vitro activities of furo[2,3b]quinoline and acridone alkaloids against Plasmodium falciparum were evaluated by an isotopic semimicrotest. A pyran ring in the furoquinoline nucleus and 2-O-pyranoglycoside and 2-nitro substituents in the acridone nucleus improved the antimalarial activities of the compounds. These findings provide a clue for further chemical modifications.
