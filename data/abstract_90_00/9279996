In vitro sensitivity of Acanthamoeba castellani was tested to three drugs: Chloroquine, ivermectin and fungizone (amphotericin B). Sensitivity was demonstrated to the latter two compounds but not to chloroquine. Thus ivermectin and amphotericin B show promise as therapeutic agents against this parasite.
