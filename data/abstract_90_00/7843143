Both V79 and As/R28A cells (an arsenite-resistant Chinese hamster V79 cell variant) show increased resistance to toxic concentrations of arsenite after pretreatment with a nontoxic concentration. The induced tolerance can be completely inhibited by actinomycin D or cycloheximide. Pretreatment with a nontoxic heat shock (45 degrees C, 10 min) resulted in a clear increased thermotolerance in both cell lines but failed to induce arsenite tolerance in either cell line. Pretreatment with arsenite induced a thermotolerance in V79 cells but not in As/R28A cells. These results are consistent with a model whereby the signal for induction of arsenite tolerance involves binding of arsenite to a protein effector which is amplified in the As/R28A line, thereby preventing action of arsenite in the regulation of heat shock factor which induces the heat shock response.
