Offsetting ethanol-induced hypothermia in five inbred strains of mice changed ethanol sensitivity within strains and markedly reduced differences between strains in brain sensitivity to hypnotic ethanol doses. The present study extended this work to mice selectively bred for sensitivity and resistance to ethanol-induced loss of righting reflex (LORR) and hypothermia. In all experiments LORR duration and ethanol concentrations at return of righting reflex were measured after i.p. hypnotic ethanol doses and exposure to 22 or 34 degrees C. In experiment 1, C57BL/6J, A/HeJ, 129/J, LS/lbg and SS/lbg mice were given 4.2 g/kg ethanol. In experiment 2, the same mouse genotypes were tested with different ethanol doses (2.5-4.9 g/kg) selected to produce an equivalent degree of impairment (60 min LORR duration). In experiment 3, HOT and COLD lines of mice were given 4.0 g/kg ethanol. In agreement with previous work, offsetting hypothermia reduced differences between genotypes in ethanol sensitivity. Comparisons within genotypes indicated that ethanol sensitivity in C57, A/He, SS, HOT and COLD mice increased as body temperature increased. In contrast, ethanol sensitivity in 129 and LS mice decreased as body temperature increased. These results extend previous findings indicating that body temperature during intoxication contributes to differences between genotypes in ethanol sensitivity. The present findings also suggest that there are qualitative differences in the effects of temperature on ethanol sensitivity within genotypes.
