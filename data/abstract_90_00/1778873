The bactericidal activity of ceftizoxime, cefotetan, and clindamycin at 0.5 x MIC, 1 x MIC, and 4 x MIC was determined by killing kinetic studies for 12 cefoxitin-resistant strains of the Bacteroides fragilis group. Ceftizoxime and clindamycin had greater bactericidal activity than cefotetan. The degree of bactericidal activity of each compound increased as the concentration increased from subinhibitory (0.5 x MIC) to suprainhibitory concentrations (4 x MIC). Comparison of the bactericidal activity at the MIC of the test agents with the MIC showed greater killing of susceptible strains than the resistant strains. Interestingly, ceftizoxime was more active than clindamycin, or cefotetan, against strains with high cefoxitin MIC values.
