In Thailand, artesunate and artemether are the mainly used antimalarials for treatment of severe or multidrug resistant falciparum malaria. However, their availability (supply) and the registration requirements are the major limitations for their large-scale use. At Bangkok Hospital for Tropical Diseases, Thailand, we have studied the new artemisinin derivatives, dihydroartemisinin and arteether, and artesunate suppositories. We found that the three preparations are well tolerated, safe, and efficacious.
