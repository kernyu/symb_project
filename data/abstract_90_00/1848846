The transposon Tn10-encoded tetA gene product is a metal-tetracycline/proton antiporter (Yamaguchi, A., Udagawa, T., and Sawai, T. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 4809-4813). Its tetracycline transport activity was inhibited by a histidine-specific reagent, diethyl pyrocarbonate. Among five histidine residues in this antiporter, only His257 is located in the putative transmembrane helices. Thus, His257 was replaced by Glu or Asp. Inverted vesicles containing the Glu257 and Asp257 mutant proteins showed only 20 and 10% of the tetracycline uptake of wild-type vesicles, respectively. In contrast to wild-type vesicles, the mutant vesicles showed no tetracycline-dependent proton translocation, indicating that the mutant proteins had lost the tetracycline/H+ antiport activity. The significant 60Co2+ uptake without proton translocation by the mutant vesicles also confirmed that the mutant carriers act as uniporters of a metal-tetracycline complex. The metal-tetracycline uniport by the mutant proteins was not inhibited by diethyl pyrocarbonate, indicating that His257 is the only histidine residue essential for proton translocation. These mutant proteins conferred about half-level resistance to tetracycline, probably due to their catalyzing downhill efflux of a metal-tetracycline complex out of the cells.
