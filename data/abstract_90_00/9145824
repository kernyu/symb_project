DW-116 is a novel fluoroquinolone that was two- to four-fold more active than rufloxacin and less active than sparfloxacin, ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin against Gram-positive bacteria in vitro. Against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, the in-vivo activity of DW-116 was similar or slightly greater than that of rufloxacin and less than that of sparfloxacin, ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin. ED50 (50% effective dose) values for DW-116 did not correlate with in-vitro MICs.
