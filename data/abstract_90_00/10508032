From October 1997 to November 1998, 1,180 respiratory tract isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae were collected from 18 medical centers in 9 of the 10 Canadian provinces. Penicillin-intermediate and -resistant isolates occurred at rates of 14.8 and 6.4%, respectively, and these rates varied considerably by geographic region. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, tetracycline, and macrolide rates of nonsusceptibility were 12.2, 10.6, and 8.0 to 9.3%, respectively. The most potent agents studied were newer fluoroquinolones.
