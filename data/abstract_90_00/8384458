Some recently introduced antimicrobial agents have only been incompletely evaluated for use in Francisella tularensis infections. The present study evaluated the susceptibility pattern of Scandinavian human, rodent, and hare F. tularensis isolates with respect to a selection of traditional as well as recently introduced antimicrobial agents. All strains were resistant to the following beta-lactams: penicillin, cephalexin, cefuroxime, ceftazidime, aztreonam, imipenem, and meropenem with minimal inhibitory concentrations > 32 mg/l. Against macrolides, a mixed susceptibility/resistance pattern appeared. All strains were susceptible to gentamicin, chloramphenicol, doxycycline, and four quinolones. Since the quinolones showed the lowest MIC values, and in addition give a good intracellular penetration, we conclude that future drugs to consider against tularemia should definitely include this group of antibiotics. The outpatient mode of antibiotic treatment is especially relevant as the Scandinavian variant of F. tularensis infection is nonlethal, usually pustuloglandular, and not septicemic. Therefore, oral drugs must be sought, and the quinolone group also satisfies this requirement.
