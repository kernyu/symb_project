The emergence of human immunodeficiency virus resistant to 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (zidovudine, AZT) in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) or AIDS-related complex has been documented. Isolates from non-AZT-treated persons or those who had received AZT for less than six months showed a narrow range of susceptibility to the drug; on the other hand, isolates from those who had received AZT for six months or more consistently showed reduced susceptibility. Five highly AZT-resistant isolates were also insensitive to other compounds containing a 3'-azido group. No cross-resistance was found to other nucleoside analogues, including 2',3'-dideoxycytidine and 2',3'-dideoxyinosine. That cross-resistance occurred only in compounds containing a 3'-azido group suggests that mutations in the reverse transcriptase gene prohibit the enzyme from using nucleoside triphosphate containing a 3'-azido group. Progressive, stepwise increases in resistance have been associated with the sequential accumulation of specific amino acid changes in the reverse transcriptase gene. It is not yet known whether the resistant phenotype as determined in vitro results in clinical resistance to AZT. The gradual appearance of resistant isolates, the variable course of human immunodeficiency virus infections, and the absence of a consistent pattern of resurgent p24 antigen will make the emergence of AZT resistance difficult to correlate with clinical status or other markers. The combination of AZT with other drugs that do not share cross-resistance is a promising area for investigation to identify regimens that are more active and less likely to induce resistance.
