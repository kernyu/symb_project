Wortmannin, a selective inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (P13K), was found to give a dose and time-dependent, bimodal effect-initial increase, followed by decrease on the tight junction integrity of MDCK-1 monolayers, as assessed by electrical resistance measurement of the epithelia. Moreover, dihydrocytochalasin B inhibited the wortmannin-induced alteration, whereas cytochalasin B had a negligible influence on the wortmannin effect. Wortmannin was also found to cause changes in the cytoskeleton structure. These alterations were also seen when wortmannin was combined with cytochalasin B. However, in accordance with the electrical resistance measurements, dihydrocytochalasin B was able to abolish wortmannin-induced filamentous (F-) actin changes. These findings suggest that the P13K, phosphatidylinositols, and filamentous actin rearrangements, in combination, play an important role in the modulation of the junctional integrity.
