Antibiotics belong to the most commonly used drugs in surgical practice. Even though they are usually safe adverse reactions and side effects will occur. They can be divided into pharmacologic side effects (impairment of coagulation, ototoxicity, nephrotoxicity), immunologic side effects (immunosuppression, allergic reactions), microbiologic side effects (emergence of resistance, superinfection) and iatrogenic problems. The most commonly made mistakes are antibiotic therapy without clear indication, neglecting pharmacokinetics, unwarranted combination therapy and failure to perform necessary surgical procedures. In order to minimize side effects and errors a limited number of substances should be selected depending on local conditions. Usually, ten antibiotics are sufficient for general surgical practice.
