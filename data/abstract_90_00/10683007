St John's wort reduced the area under the curve of the HIV-1 protease inhibitor indinavir by a mean of 57% (SD 19) and decreased the extrapolated 8-h indinavir trough by 81% (16) in healthy volunteers. A reduction in indinavir exposure of this magnitude could lead to the development of drug resistance and treatment failure.
