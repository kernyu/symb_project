Salmonella Enteritidis is an important pathogen for the layer industry, primarily because of its ability to infect hens and ultimately contaminate egg contents. Studies have shown that stress situations, such as flock recycling (induced molting), can increase Salmonella Enteritidis problems in the flock. The present study examined the effect of antibiotic treatment and competitive exclusion (CE) on Salmonella Enteritidis shedding in the period following molt and 14-day feed withdrawal. In two separate trials, 48 birds after molt and feed withdrawal were divided into one group that was treated for 10 days with enrofloxacin in water followed by administration of CE culture and a group that was left untreated. Salmonella Enteritidis shedding was significantly reduced in the antibiotic-CE group. The Salmonella Enteritidis shedding rate was 33 and 25% in untreated birds versus 4 and 0% in the enrofloxacin-CE group on the two test days. These results indicate that treatment of Salmonella Enteritidis-positive laying hens after molting with enrofloxacin and CE culture can substantially reduce Salmonella Enteritidis problems due to molting and would be a possible alternative to diverting eggs for pasteurization or slaughtering the infected flock. Possible development of bacterial resistance in conjunction with antibiotic use is also discussed.
