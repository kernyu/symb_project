OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the diagnosis and treatment for malignant gestational trophoblastic tumor (MGTT) with pulmonary metastasis complicated with pulmonary tuberculosis. METHODS: To analyze ten cases of MGTT with pulmonary metastasis complicated with pulmonary tuberculosis in our hospital from 1980 to 1997 retrospectively. RESULTS: From the x-ray film, there are great resemblances between MGTT with pulmonary metastasis and pulmonary tuberculosis. Of 10 patients, 7 of them were examined out pulmonary tuberculosis during the chemotherapy of MGTT. Pulmonary tuberculosis appeared six months before chemotherapy in three cases. All of the patients were treated with multiagent chemotherapy. Seven patients achiceved a complete remission, 2 patients developed drug resistance and died of cerebral haemorrhage and cerebral herniation, 1 woman who had achieved a complete remission from MGTT for 14 months died of miliary tuberculosis. CONCLUSION: It is very important to make differential diagnosis of the MGTT with pulmonary metastasis complicated with pulmonary tuberculosis. Trying to avoid excessive anti-tumor treatment owing to mistake pulmonary tuberculosis for pulmonary metastasis, and avoiding missing an opportunity of anti-tuberculosis treatment because of missed diagnosis should be emphasized.
