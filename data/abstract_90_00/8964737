Lung ischemia-reperfusion results in a decrease in the release of nitric oxide (NO) by the pulmonary endothelium. NO may have lung-protective effects by decreasing neutrophil accumulation in the lung. We tested whether NO inhalation would attenuate reperfusion-induced endothelial dysfunction and increases in microvascular permeability and total pulmonary vascular resistance (RT) by preventing neutrophil lung accumulation. After baseline determinations of RT, coefficient of filtration (Kfc), and circulating neutrophil counts, isolated neonatal piglet lungs were subjected to a 1-h period of ischemia followed by a 1-h period of blood reperfusion and reventilation with or without addition of NO (10 ppm). NO prevented reperfusion-induced increases in RT and Kfc, as well as the decrease in circulating neutrophils. After reperfusion, increases in Kfc were correlated with decreases in circulating neutrophils. NO prevented reperfusion-induced decrease in endothelium-dependent relaxation in precontracted pulmonary arterial rings. This demonstrates that inhaled NO prevents microvascular injury, endothelial dysfunction, and pulmonary neutrophil accumulation in a neonatal piglet model of lung ischemia-reperfusion.
