The in vitro activity of biapenem was compared to that of imipenem, meropenem and other broad-spectrum beta-lactams. A total of 716 isolates from recent cases of clinical septicemia and an additional 137 stock strains possessing known beta-lactamases or other well-characterized resistance mechanisms were tested. The minimal concentrations inhibiting 90% of strains (MIC90) of Enterobacteriaceae species were for biapenem 0.03 to 1 mg/l and for imipenem 0.25 to 2 mg/l. No member of the Enterobacteriaceae was found to be resistant to biapenem. Biapenem and meropenem were the most active drugs against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, with an MIC90 of 1 mg/l. Biapenem was more active than ceftazidime against most gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria tested. Biapenem was as potent as imipenem against anaerobic bacteria (including Bacteroides fragilis), with an MIC90 of 0.25 mg/l. High MICs of biapenem were demonstrated for Xanthomonas maltophilia, oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus spp. and Enterococcus spp. These species have demonstrated resistance to other carbapenems and to most of the newer cephalosporins. The results of this study, coupled with previously documented favorable qualities of biapenem, endorse further investigation of this broad-spectrum antibacterial agent for clinical use.
