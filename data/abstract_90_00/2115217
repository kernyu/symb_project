Evidence of the presence of plasmids in Mycobacterium tuberculosis is lacking, whereas they are widespread in some other mycobacterial species. We examined, by agarose gel electrophoresis, a total of 197 clinical isolates of M. tuberculosis, mostly resistant to one or more antibiotics, and were able to detect bands of apparently extrachromosomal DNA at a low level in some isolates. These presumptive plasmids could not be isolated by CsCl/ethidium bromide gradient ultracentrifugation, and may consist of unusual forms of DNA. The possible existence of single stranded plasmid DNA is discussed.
