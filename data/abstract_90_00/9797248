We tested 16 erythromycin-resistant clinical isolates of S. aureus, recovered from patients hospitalized in the United States from 1958 to 1969, for the presence of ermA, ermB, and ermC by using PCR. Fifteen of 16 isolates contained at least one copy of ermA; the remaining isolate, which was also clindamycin resistant, contained ermB. Eight of the 15 isolates harboring ermA, all of which were inducible, contained a single copy of the gene in the chromosome, while the remaining seven isolates had two copies of the gene. ermB was plasmid encoded and mediated constitutive resistance to erythromycin.
