OBJECTIVE: To compare actual vancomycin use in a hospital with the guidelines proposed by the Hospital Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee (HICPAC) of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. DESIGN: One-month prospective survey of all patients given vancomycin. Data were collected from patient and laboratory records and discussions with prescribing physicians. SETTING: Four hundred sixty-one-bed tertiary-care university hospital. RESULTS: Only 35% of the 101 vancomycin orders written during the audit were consistent with HICPAC guidelines. Twenty-eight patients were begun on vancomycin for the treatment of documented infections due to beta-lactam-resistant gram-positive bacteria or because preliminary culture results suggested such bacteria were present. Seven methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, two ampicillin-resistant enterococci, and 10 coagulase-negative staphylococci were recovered. Vancomycin use was judged inappropriate in 66 patients. The drug was used empirically without obtaining appropriate cultures (44 patients), as surgical prophylaxis (6 patients), for primary treatment of antibiotic-associated colitis (3 patients), for convenience in a hemodialysis patient (1 patient), or for other reasons not recommended by HICPAC (12 patients). CONCLUSIONS: Vancomycin use in our teaching center often was inconsistent with HICPAC guidelines. Information from the audit will be useful for designing strategies to improve vancomycin use.
