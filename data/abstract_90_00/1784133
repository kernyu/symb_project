Cellular antigens extracted from the cells of four Staphylococcus aureus strains from different kinds of infections (sepsis, osteomyelitis, furunculosis) were analysed by the western blotting technique. Antibiotic sensitivity pattern of the strains was compared. One isolate was found to be MRSA strain. Sera samples from patients of whom strains were isolated and four sera from blood donors (as a control) were used in the investigation. IgG levels for purified staphylococcal antigens (lipase, alpha-toxin and teichoic acid) were estimated. Interaction between extracted bacterial antigens and serum antibodies of IgG class were analysed in homologous and heterologous systems. The most strong immunological reaction of the investigated sera with staphylococcal antigens was observed in the case of homologous system. Serum from sepsis patient was found to be the most reactive serum with all staphylococcal antigens mixtures.
