Enteropathogenic E. coli strains (n = 120), isolated from faeces in 1988-1989, were sensitive to cefotaxime and ceftriaxone (100%) and to colistin, amikacin, cefoperazone, cefuroxime, cefamandole, netilmicin, gentamicin, tobramycin and neomycin (94.2-99.2%). These strains were resistant to ampicillin (55.6%) and carbenicillin (52.5%). It was found that E. coli strains of serotype 018:K76 were resistant mainly to ampicillin and carbenicillin, whereas E. coli strains of serotype 0119:K69 were resistant mainly to tetracyclines and carbenicillin.
