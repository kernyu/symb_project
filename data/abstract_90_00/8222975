The minimal inhibitory concentration of norfloxacin, pefloxacin, ciprofloxacin and other ten antimicrobial agents for 143 strains of Gram-positive cocci and 267 strains of Gram-negative bacilli of recent clinical isolates from June 1990 to March 1991 was analyzed. The results showed that ciprofloxacin and norrancomycin were more active than other antimicrobial agents against most of the Gram-positive cocci, while ciprofloxacin and the third generation cephalosporins were more active than other antimicrobial agents against most of the Gram-negative bacilli. The reason for the resistance to antimicrobial agents may be associated with the fact that these bacteria were isolated from inpatients with chronic urinary tract infection or lower respiratory infection of preexisting chronic pulmonary diseases, who had been treated with many antimicrobial agents. Bacteria with resistance to pefloxacin and ciprofloxacin have been found, though these agents have never been used in Tianjin. Resistance of bacteria to ciprofloxacin and pefloxacin may be concerned with cross-resistance that resulted from prolonged and widespread use of norfloxacin in Tianjin. It was also found that norvancomycin resistance (MIC, > 16 mg/L) was encountered in 6 of 34 clinical isolates of oxacillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus.
