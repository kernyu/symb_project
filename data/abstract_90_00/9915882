The newly identified hemochromatosis gene, HFE, and a candidate iron transporter gene, Nramp2, have been proposed as key factors responsible for the regulation of intestinal iron absorption. Although the exact functions of these proteins in intestinal iron absorption are unknown, HFE may be required for the down-regulation of iron absorption that occurs with increasing iron status, and Nramp2 may up-regulate iron absorption when iron status is low. Thus, we examined whether the expression of the HFE and Nramp2 genes are regulated by iron status in the human intestinal cell line Caco-2. HFE mRNA and HFE protein were increased and Nramp2 mRNA was decreased by increasing cellular iron status in Caco-2 cells. This iron-mediated modulation of mRNA levels was specific to iron. Moreover, super-induction of HFE mRNA in the presence of cycloheximide suggests that HFE gene expression may be controlled by a short-lived repressor protein. HFE and Nramp2 mRNA levels also changed in opposite directions during cellular differentiation. This reciprocal modification of the HFE and Nramp2 gene expression during both iron treatment and cell differentiation in Caco-2 cells is consistent with an opposing role for these proteins in homeostatic regulation of human intestinal iron absorption.
