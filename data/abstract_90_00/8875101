OBJECTIVE: To alert physicians caring for patients with diabetes to the microorganism Eikenella corrodens and to discuss the appropriate preventive and therapeutic measures to take against this potentially morbid opportunistic Gram-negative bacilli. CASES: We present two cases of extra-oral E. corrodens infections in adolescent females with IDDM. The first patient had diabetes of 4 years' duration, which was moderately well controlled. Chronic finger biting resulted in a complex felon that evolved gradually and worsened while the patient received cephalexin orally. Delay in seeking further intervention resulted in necrosis of her distal fingertip and nail bed. The second patient had poorly controlled diabetes for 5 years. She developed an acute thigh abscess at an insulin injection site that resolved after drainage and intravenous antibiotics. CONCLUSIONS: E. corrodens commonly inhabits the human oral cavity and becomes a pathogen mostly when host defenses are impaired, causing abscesses and infections that are at times fatal. Patients with IDDM are compromised hosts and with daily microtrauma to their skin via glucose monitoring and insulin injections, are prone to develop E. corrodens infections that can be introduced through oral secretions by licking or biting their skin. Educational efforts aimed at preventing exposure of traumatized skin to oral secretions can minimize the risk of E. corrodens infections in compromised hosts. Early intravenous administration of antibiotics, bearing in mind E. corrodens resistance to clindamycin, metronidazole, and other antibiotics, coupled with prompt surgical intervention, is essential in successfully managing E. corrodens infections.
