Since 1981 we monitored all the bacteria strains isolated from patients bearing a surgical infection and hospitalized in our department. We also tested the susceptibility of the isolated strains to different antibiotics. The observed results at three different intervals (1981, 1984, 1987-1988) reveal an increase in Gram+strains. Among the tested antibiotics Imipenem and Amikacin showed the highest antibacterial activity in recent years (1987-1988).
