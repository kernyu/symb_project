The fidelity of mitotic chromosome transmission in Schizosaccharomyces pombe was estimated quantitatively by using cycloheximide resistance as a means to select cells that had undergone chromosome loss or nondisjunction. We aimed to investigate the connection between recombination and mitotic chromosome stability. A number of mutants defective in mitotic recombination such as cdc17-L16, rec59-72, and rec50-25 were tested and in these an approximately ten fold elevation of mitotic haploidization rate was found compared with controls. Our data suggest that recombination is important in controlling the maintenance of chromosomes during mitosis.
