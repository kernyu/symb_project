Forty-eight clinical isolates of Streptococcus suis were examined for antibiotic sensitivity and the presence of plasmid DNA. It was determined that isolates from this study showed a substantial increase in resistance to erythromycin (ery), clindamycin, and tetracycline (tet) compared to a similar study conducted five years earlier. Eleven of the 48 isolates contained plasmid DNA as revealed by DNA isolation and gel electrophoresis. Plasmid DNA from four strains resistant to the above three antibiotics was tested for the ability to transform an antibiotic sensitive recipient. No transformation of antibiotic resistance could be demonstrated. In other experiments, the above four strains, along with four plasmid-negative triply resistant strains were tested for the ability to transfer tet or ery resistance to tet and ery sensitive recipients by conjugation. In each mating, antibiotic resistance was transferred at frequencies averaging 2.4 x 10(-6) recombinants/recipient for ery and 3.4 x 10(-6) recombinants/recipient for tet resistance. DNA from each clinical specimen, as well as the recombinants mentioned above was probed with tn916. Autoradiographs revealed that several clinical isolates and recombinants bound the probe. It is concluded that conjugation of antibiotic resistance in these clinical strains is possibly mediated by a transposon similar to tn916.
