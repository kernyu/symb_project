BACKGROUND: When metronidazole is used in bismuth-based or proton pump inhibitor-based triple therapy, the cure rate of Helicobacter pylori is usually high. However, metronidazole-resistant H. pylori strains, which are increasing in frequency, are a major cause of failed H. pylori eradication. AIM: To evaluate the efficacy of non-metronidazole containing bismuth-based triple therapy for H. pylori infection. METHODS: One-hundred and eighty H. pylori-positive patients with endoscopically documented peptic ulcer disease or functional dyspepsia were randomly assigned to one of three 1-week regimens containing tripotassium dicitrato bismuthate (also called colloidal bismuth subcitrate) 240 mg b.d. and two antibiotics: furazolidone 100 mg b.d. plus clarithromycin 250 mg b.d. (Group A); or clarithromycin 250 mg b.d. plus amoxycillin 1000 mg b.d. (Group B); or furazolidone 100 mg b.d. plus josamycin 1000 mg b.d. (Group C). H. pylori status was assessed by rapid urease test, histology and culture of gastric biopsy specimens taken from both the antrum and corpus, both before and at least 4 weeks after completion of therapy. RESULTS: Thirteen patients dropped out (3 in group A, 5 in group B and 5 in group C). Based on an intention-to-treat analysis, the eradication rates achieved in groups A, B and C were 88% (53/60), 58% (35/60) and 77% (46/60), respectively. These differences were significant between groups A and B (P < 0.001), as well as between groups B and C (P < 0.05). Side-effects occurred in 7 (12%) patients in group A, 3 (5%) in group B and 8 (13%) in group C, and were mild, with the exception of vomiting in one patient (group C) that resulted in withdrawal from the study. CONCLUSION: One-week triple therapy, consisting of tripotassium dicitrato bismuthate, low-dose furazolidone and low-dose clarithromycin, achieves a high cure rate of H. pylori.
