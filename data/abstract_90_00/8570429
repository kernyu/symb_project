Increasing reports of vancomycin resistance have raised concerns about the future effectiveness of this drug in treatment of critically ill patients with gram-positive infections. Due to these concerns the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently published criteria that delineate the prudent use of vancomycin. Using these criteria, we attempted to determine the appropriateness of vancomycin prescribing patterns at our institution. A retrospective chart review was performed for 135 hospitalized patients treated between May 1993 and April 1994. Inappropriate empiric vancomycin use was documented in 81 (60%) of these patients. When culture results were available, 28 (21%) patients inappropriately received the drug. Results of this study are similar to those of other studies of vancomycin use in hospitals based on non-CDC criteria. If CDC criteria are to have a positive impact on physicians' vancomycin prescribing patterns, significant educational efforts will be required.
