The recent revision of the taxonomy of 'faecal streptococci' prompted us to verify the importance of identifying the species of this group of cocci. During a study carried out to assess the hygienic quality of environmental samples from a variety of sources, we isolated 198 strains named faecal streptococci on the basis of conventional international tests (EVA broth multiple tube test) used for Public Health purposes. The predominant species were Enterococcus faecalis (39%) and Ent. faecium (29%), followed by Ent. durans/hirae, Ent. casseliflavus/gallinarum, Ent. raffinosus, with a different prevalence of the species depending on the source. Eighty-four per cent of isolates were true faecal species. Only one isolate was identified as belonging to the Streptococcus genus. The authors stress the opportunity to identify the species. This may help to clarify the ecological and epidemiological characteristics of intestinal enterococci and streptococci in the environment, in drinking and recreational waters and their meaning as indicators of faecal pollution. All isolates were tested for their susceptibility to some antimicrobial agents widely used in medical therapy and the pattern was compared with the pattern of isolates from clinical specimens.
