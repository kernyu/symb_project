Gentamicin resistance in six enterococcal species was investigated. Transfer of resistance was observed for the donors E. faecium UC 79, E. avium CC 54, and E. gallinarum B 51, but not for E. raffinosus UC 78 or E. casseliflavus UC 73. Except for E. casseliflavus UC 73, homology was observed between the E. faecalis aac6'-aph2" gene and DNA from other species. Whereas 2.6-kb HindIII fragments encoded resistance in E. faecalis UC 244, its transconjugant, and E. raffinosus UC 78, 3.4-kb fragments encoded resistance in E. faecium UC 79, E. gallinarum B 51, and their transconjugants. A 3.4-kb fragment encoded resistance in E. avium CC 54, but 2.6-kb fragments encoded resistance in the transconjugants. Although many similarities were found among the strains, the heterogeneity in gentamicin resistance exhibited by some isolates indicates diversity among these determinants.
