The anti-ischemic effect of a 4% proxanol solution (intravenous injection in a dose of 10 ml/kg 60 min after occlusion) was compared with that of a salt solution in experimental acute ischemia of dog myocardium, induced by partial occlusion of the anterior descending branch of the left coronary artery. Overall estimation of the effect of SAS infusion has demonstrated that this drug has a beneficial effect on hemorheology (decreases blood viscosity and vascular resistance, increases coronary blood flow), stabilizes oxygen supply of the myocardium and lowers the extent of its ischemia-induced damage (eliminates ST segment depression). However, the cardiodepressive action of proxanol does not allow for compensation of the ischemia-induced decrease in myocardial contractility and pump function of the heart.
