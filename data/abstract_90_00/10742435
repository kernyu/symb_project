We report a case of combined surgical repair including lower limb revascularization (below-knee bypass) and abdominal aortic aneurysm repair using cryopreserved arterial homograft. The patient experienced lower limb ischemia due to repeated thrombosis of a long-infected polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) graft, and was also shown to have a complicating abdominal aortic aneurysm. Infection was eradicated with total graft excision and intravenous antibiotics. Two-year patency of the in situ arterial homograft revascularization was demonstrated with hemodynamic and tomographic controls; no degenerations have been found to date. Benefits of the use of in situ arterial homograft for arterial reconstruction may include improved hemodynamics and greater resistance to infection compared to when alloplastic materials are used. Because of the risk of allograft deterioration, close follow-up of the patient is required.
