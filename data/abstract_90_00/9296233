OBJECTIVE: To review the appropriateness of vancomycin therapy, changes in vancomycin use, and the incidence of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) after implementation of a limited restriction policy requiring approval from the Infectious Diseases Approval service to continue vancomycin therapy beyond 72 hours. DESIGN: A prospective chart review was conducted in April 1995. Pharmacy billing data and infection control data were compared before and after policy implementation. SETTING: A 725-bed university teaching institution. PATIENTS: All patients receiving vancomycin during April 1995. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Appropriateness of use was based on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommendations for prudent vancomycin use. RESULTS: A total of 333 courses of vancomycin therapy were reviewed. Vancomycin use was appropriate in 219 (66%) courses. Of the 114 courses that did not meet the CDC guidelines, 76 (67%) were for empiric use, 35 (31%) were for prophylactic use, and 3 (3%) were for therapeutic use. Overall, the total number of grams used decreased 9%, grams per 1000 patient-days decreased by 10, and the total number of patients exposed to vancomycin decreased 0.5%. Several services had large decreases in vancomycin use. Vancomycin expenditures decreased by $15788 for the 7-month time period. The incidence of VRE remained unchanged, at 30% of all enterococcal isolates 2 years after policy implementation. CONCLUSIONS: The limited restriction policy was effective in decreasing the total grams of vancomycin used. However, one-third of vancomycin therapy was inappropriate and the incidence of VRE was unchanged. A more stringent restriction policy could potentially increase appropriate use, further decrease the amount of vancomycin used, and decrease the incidence of VRE.
