280 Salmonella typhi strains isolated from suspected cases of enteric fever during the year 1990 were studied for susceptibility to the antimicrobial agents chloramphenicol, ampicillin, cotrimoxazole, gentamycin, kanamycin, amikacin, ciprofloxacin by Kirby Baur disc diffusion method. All were blood culture positive cases. 63 strains (21.9%) were found resistant to chloramphenicol, ampicillin, cotrimoxazole, but sensitive to the amino glycosides and ciprofloxacin. Present study shows the prevalence of multi drug resistant Salmonella typhi in this region of Punjab.
