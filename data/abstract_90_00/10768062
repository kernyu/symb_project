More than 900 isolates from at least 1500 patients were tested within 1996-1998. Gram-negative organisms were the main pathogens isolated from patients with different forms of nosocomial complications such as late pneumonia, associated with artificial ventilation of the lungs, and various secondary wound or urinary tract infections. The prevalence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was stated. Antibioticograms showed that the most active drugs were imipenem (more than 90 per cent of the susceptible isolates) and ticarcillin/clavulanate (48-58 per cent of the susceptible isolates). The activity of ticarcillin/clavulanate (Timentin) was practically the same as that of imipenem against 21 strains of P.aeruginosa isolated from the blood and cerebrospinal fluid of 21 patients with sepsis and 3 patients with secondary purulent meningitis.
