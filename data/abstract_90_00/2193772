1. Plasmids bearing the G418-resistant gene neo were transfected into cultured fish cells RBCF-1 by electroporation at an efficiency comparable to that in NIH3T3 cells. 2. Transfection of plasmids bearing both neo and activated human c-Ha-ras into NIH3T3 and RBCF-1 cells resulted in the malignant transformation of the former but not of the latter cells.
