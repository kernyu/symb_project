BACKGROUND: To evaluate the resistance of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in subjects with simultaneous infection by the human immunodeficiency virus. METHODS: Isolation of Mycobacterium tuberculosis was carried out in a University hospital over a period of 7 years with selection of those corresponding to subjects with HIV infection. The isolation of Mycobacterium tuberculosis with resistance to one or more chemotherapeutic drugs was identified and is described herein. RESULTS: A total of 287 subjects were identified having tuberculous disease, 39 (13.59%) of them presented a simultaneous infection by the human immunodeficiency virus. In 4 of the latter (10.26%) Mycobacterium tuberculosis resistant to one or more chemotherapeutic drugs was isolated with the most frequent resistance being to isoniazide (3/4). CONCLUSIONS: A high degree of diagnostic suspicion must be maintained in patients with the human immunodeficiency virus with respect to tuberculosis, not only because of frequent endogenous activation but also because of the danger of in-hospital transmission. The possibility of resistance makes systematic antibiograms in these cases advisable. In these patients recommendations regarding treatment should be followed avoiding shortened or simplified therapeutic periods which have occasionally been demonstrated as ineffective.
