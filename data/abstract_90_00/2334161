A nationwide susceptibility survey of 557 isolates of the Bacteroides fragilis group was continued in 1986. The most active beta-lactam drugs were imipenem and ticarcillin-clavulanic acid, which had 0.2 and 1.7% resistance, respectively. The rank order of activity of beta-lactam drugs was imipenem, ticarcillin-clavulanic acid, cefoxitin, piperacillin, moxalactam, ceftizoxime, cefotetan, cefotaxime, cefoperazone, and ceftazadime.
