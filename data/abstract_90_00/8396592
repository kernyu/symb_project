Susceptibility to sparfloxacin was tested simultaneously by the agar dilution and disk diffusion methods. For tests with 5-micrograms sparfloxacin disks, we propose that the breakpoints for the susceptibility and resistance categories should be > or = 19 and < or = 15 mm, respectively. Most minor discrepancies involved tests with pseudomonads.
