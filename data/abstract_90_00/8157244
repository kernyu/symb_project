Use of disinfectants is regarded as the most important procedure for preventing the transmission of nosocomial infections. Because microorganisms exhibit a wide range of resistance to disinfectants, it follows that the kinds of microorganisms known and the characteristics of selected disinfectants must be consideration. Chemical disinfectants can be classified to three categories according to its germicidal action, namely, high-, intermediate-and low -level disinfectant. The efficacy of disinfection is affected by a number of factors, each of which nullify or limit the efficacy of the process. Some of the factors are the organic load on the object; the prior cleaning of the object; the type and level of microbial contamination; the concentration of and exposure time to the germicide; the temperature and pH of the disinfection process. Handwashing is the single most important procedure for preventing nosocomial infections. Although plain soaps have been shown to be adequate for routine handwashing in the absence of a true emergency, antimicrobial handwashing products should be used for handwashing before personnel take care of newborns, severely immunocompromised patients and patients in high-risk units. It will be possible to reduce the nosocomial infection that the use of rationale handwashing technique, motivation and knowledge about the importance of handwashing are achieved.
