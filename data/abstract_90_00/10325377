A separation between mecA+ strains of Staphylococcus aureus and strains lacking mecA was achieved by the disk diffusion assay and the agar dilution method, utilizing disks containing 5 microg of oxacillin and inocula of approximately 5 x 10(5) CFU/spot, respectively, provided that agar with 0 to 0.5% NaCl and incubation at 30 degrees C were employed. The 5-microg oxacillin disks clearly discriminated between borderline methicillin-susceptible and mecA+ strains. The oxacillin MICs were more affected by the inoculum density and salt concentration than were the methicillin MICs, and oxacillin MICs of 4 to 16 microg/ml were obtained for strains lacking mecA. Significantly higher levels of beta-lactamase production and reduced oxacillin susceptibilities were recorded for strains lacking mecA, in particular strains of phage group V, when agar with >/=2% NaCl was used than when agar with 0 to 0.5% NaCl was employed. The results indicate that the borderline methicillin-susceptible phenotype is a salt-dependent in vitro phenomenon of questionable clinical relevance.
