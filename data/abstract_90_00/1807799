Tuberculosis (TB) is increasing in Zimbabwe and other countries in Africa and world-wide. TB treatment and control face new difficulties including the impact of the HIV epidemic and drug resistance. There is now abundant evidence that six-month regimens are highly effective and, by improving compliance, can improve results and the cost-effectiveness of therapy. Intermittent therapy reduces drug costs and allows for the possibility of complete supervision. The optimal management of the HIV-infected TB patient has not yet been established but an increased rate of drug reactions suggests that standard treatment should be reassessed.
