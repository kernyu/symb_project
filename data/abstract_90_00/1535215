Antibiotic resistance of the resident cutaneous bacterial flora is a well recognized consequence of systemic antibiotic therapy. In this study, we followed the development of antibiotic resistance of coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), the most numerous aerobic bacteria found on the skin surface, during treatment with three topical antimicrobial agents used to treat acne vulgaris. Groups of 20 subjects received either topical erythromycin, benzoyl peroxide or a combination of the two for 16 weeks. After 12 weeks of treatment with erythromycin, the aerobic flora was dominated by S. epidermidis which was completely resistant to erythromycin. In addition there was an increase in resistance to clindamycin and tetracycline. Treatment with benzoyl peroxide and the combination of erythromycin and benzoyl peroxide resulted in a significant reduction in the number of aerobic bacteria without any change in the resistance pattern to erythromycin or other antibiotics.
