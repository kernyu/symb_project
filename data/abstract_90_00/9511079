Serious infection with vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VREF) strains has no proven effective antimicrobial therapy. We compared the clinical and bacteriological outcomes of 20 patients with VREF bacteraemia treated with quinupristin/dalfopristin (RP 59500), an investigational streptogramin, with a historical cohort of 42 patients with VREF bacteraemia treated with other agents. Quinupristin/dalfopristin demonstrated in-vitro bacteriostatic activity against all 20 initial VREF blood isolates (MIC range 0.03-0.50 mg/L) by macrobroth dilution. The clinical characteristics of both groups were comparable for major outcome-dependent variables. There were five cases of recurrent VREF bacteraemia in the quinupristin/dalfopristin-treated cohort and 21 in the controls (P = 0.11); persistence of VREF at the primary site was found in six and 18 of the evaluable patients with follow-up cultures in these two cohorts (P = 0.06). In-hospital mortality was high in both groups: 65% in the quinupristin/dalfopristin group and 52% in the control group; however, VREF-associated mortality was significantly lower in the quinupristin/dalfopristin group (five and 17 respectively; P = 0.05). Follow-up susceptibility testing of five VREF isolates in the quinupristin/ dalfopristin group did not demonstrate resistance to quinupristin/dalfopristin. Quinupristin/ dalfopristin may be a useful agent for the therapy of serious VREF infection. Further clinical investigations are warranted to confirm or refute its clinical efficacy.
