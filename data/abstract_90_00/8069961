In order to develop new-generation macrolide antibiotics active against erythromycin (EM)-resistant strains, a series of 6-O-methyl EM 9-O-substituted oxime derivatives was synthesized and evaluated for antibacterial activity against EM-resistant (S. aureus J-109) and susceptible (S. aureus 209P) strains. To understand how substituents affect the biological activity, the quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR) was analyzed using the Hansch-Fujita method. With the EM-resistant strain, the positive coefficient for log P may indicate that higher hydrophobicity of molecules is favorable for antibacterial activity. The negative coefficients of the Sterimol parameters L, B1, and B5 may indicate that long, bulky substituents are unfavorable. With the EM-susceptible strain, the negative coefficient for log P may indicate that hydrophilicity is important for antibacterial activity. A short substituent is also required to improve the activity. Based on the QSAR model, a derivative (87) having an anthracenylmethyl moiety was synthesized to reinforce and confirm the correlation. The activity of 87 against the EM-resistant strain was significant. In QSARs of 6-O-methyl EM-A 9-O-substituted oxime derivatives, the difference of the contribution of log P to the antibacterial activity between EM-resistant and susceptible strains was clearly recognized.
