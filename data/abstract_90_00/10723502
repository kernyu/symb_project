There are many questions regarding testing for viral resistance to antiretroviral drugs and interpretation of test results. The most appropriate time for testing and the compartment from which to derive virus are still uncertain. Both phenotypic and genotypic tests are used to measure drug susceptibility; however, interpretation of results of these assessments is not clear-cut. Furthermore, correlation of these test results with clinical outcome or pharmacological data is limited by lack of studies and other confounding factors.
