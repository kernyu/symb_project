We evaluated LAK cell cytotoxicity toward a sensitive B cell lymphoma and several resistant EBV-transformed cell lines in order to explore the mechanism by which some cells are preferentially recognized as targets. Cytolysis of the sensitive cells was inhibited by monoclonal antibodies against the surface proteins LFA-1 and ICAM-1; however, surface expression of ICAM-1 was similar on the resistant and sensitive cell lines. Prevention of post-translational addition of N-linked oligosaccharides by treatment of the resistant cells with tunicamycin resulted in a dramatic enhancement in LAK cell cytotoxicity which was partially inhibited by antibodies against LFA-1 and ICAM-1. Treatment of the resistant cells with the endoglycosidase N-glycanase also increased LAK cell sensitivity. Tunicamycin treatment caused a decrease in the molecular weight of ICAM-1 from approximately 95,000 to 50,000 Da. Conjugate formation between the LAK cells and the sensitive and resistant target cells was similar before and after deglycosylation. We conclude that carbohydrate modification of ICAM-1 or an alternative glycoprotein confers resistance to LAK cell cytotoxicity in some cell lines.
