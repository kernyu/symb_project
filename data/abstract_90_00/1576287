Because of the rapid emergence of resistance to gentamicin and tobramycin among isolates of aerobic and facultative gram-negative bacteria at our university hospital, we designed a prospective study to track aminoglycoside resistance, bacteremic episodes, and bacteremia-associated deaths before and after the institution of amikacin as the sole formulary aminoglycoside. From June 1984 through June 1987 (immediately before this policy change), amikacin accounted for only 20% of patient-days of aminoglycoside therapy, and rates of resistance to gentamicin, tobramycin, and amikacin among aerobic and facultative gram-negative bacterial isolates were 12.8%, 10.8%, and 5.9%, respectively. During the next 30 months (immediately after the change in policy), amikacin accounted for 98% of patient-days of aminoglycoside therapy, and rates of resistance to gentamicin, tobramycin, and amikacin were 6.3%, 5.0%, and 3.3%, respectively. Furthermore, during the latter 30 months, the incidence of both bacteremia and bacteremia-associated death decreased significantly. Hospitals at which resistance to gentamicin or tobramycin is increasing among the gram-negative flora may benefit from the use of amikacin as the principal aminoglycoside.
