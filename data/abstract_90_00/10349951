Three patients colonized with vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus were admitted to one or more of three long-term-care facilities. Six point-prevalence surveys revealed no transmission of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus after a total of 234 days of exposure during which moderately strict infection control measures were implemented. Four of 116 environmental cultures were positive.
