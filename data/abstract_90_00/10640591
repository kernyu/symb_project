This study describes the formulation of a biomedical grade polyurethane hydrogel coating containing solid dispersed bioactive antibodies cast from an organic solvent onto a model polymer biomaterial substrate. A prepolymer dispersion in anhydrous isopropanol containing a uniformly distributed slurry of 22 microm sieved commercial lyophilized polyclonal pooled human immunoglobulin G (IgG) solids was coated onto polymer substrates by simple immersion. Maximum antibody release was approximately 50 microg/cm(2) from a 15% w/w IgG polymer coating. In vitro antimicrobial studies utilized Escherichia coli to compare performance of bare uncoated tubing, hydrogel-coated tubing with added aqueous phase antibodies, and antibody-dispersed hydrogel-coated tubing. Bacterial adhesion was reduced significantly (p<0.05) in the presence of antibodies with the greatest reduction seen with the antibody releasing coating. The presence of antibody also significantly enhanced the killing of the bacteria in an in vitro opsonophagocytic assay using freshly isolated blood neutrophils over 2 h indicating that antibody bioactivity is maintained. This controlled release polyurethane hydrogel coating imparts infection resistance by exploiting the low adhesive properties of the biomedical grade hydrogel and the intrinsic bioactive role of the antibodies to reduce bacterial adhesion and promote clearance via natural immune mechanisms.
