The in-vitro activity of five new fluoroquinolones, WIN 57273, sparfloxacin, fleroxacin, temafloxacin and ciprofloxacin was determined against 543 recent clinical isolates and eight quinolone resistant strains derived by mutation and their five parent strains. WIN 57273 was the most active compound against Gram-positive bacteria, sparfloxacin had a broad spectrum which was similar to that of ciprofloxacin. Ciprofloxacin showed the greatest activity against Gram-negative bacteria. Temafloxacin showing some activity against Gram-positive organisms and Acinetobacter spp. Fleroxacin was the least active compound studied. Compared to wild type parent strains, the mutated strains produced the following results. In Enterobacter cloacae OmpF deficiency increased the MICs of all quinolones by 8-32-fold. In Pseudomonas aeruginosa OmpF deficiency had a limited effect, Omp D2 deficiency combined with an increased lipopolysaccharide content produced greater resistance, i.e. 4-16-fold; mutations in gyrase were associated with variously increased MICs, depending on the strain and compound tested.
