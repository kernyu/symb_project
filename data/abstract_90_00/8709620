Twenty-three patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) in first relapse were treated with high-dose cytosine-arabinoside (Ara-C) and amsacrine or idarubicin. To prime the cells, the patients were given rhGM-CSF. We studied the influence of 48-h infusion of rhGM-CSF on proliferation and Ara-C sensitivity of leukemic cells both ex vivo and in vitro. We found that a 48-h infusion of rhGM-CSF increased both white blood cell counts and peripheral blood blast cell percentages. Using a Bromodeoxyuridine/DNA (BrdUrd/DNA) staining in flow cytometry, we found an non-constant increase in cells in the S-phase. Ex vivo 48-h culture of leukemic cells with or without rhGM-CSF, with or without other hematopoietic growth factors (HGFs), showed a greater increase of the cells in the S-phase with GF but no correlation with the ex vivo results. We used a method of quantitation of the DNA synthesis previously described (Lacombe F., et al. (1992) Cytometry 13, 730) to monitor the Ara-C sensitivity of the cells in S-phase before and after 48-h infusion with rhGM-CSF. We observed a great variation in the Ara-C sensitivity of the leukemic cells before and after infusion with rhGM-CSF from one patient to another. The BrdUrd/DNA method seems a convenient method to study the influence of HGFs on Ara-C sensitivity of the patients.
