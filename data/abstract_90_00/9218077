BACKGROUND: Metronidazole-resistant Helicobacter pylori are generally the rule in developing countries such as Colombia. Developing countries need an effective, simple and inexpensive non-metronidazole therapy for H. pylori infection. AIM: To evaluate the combination of bismuth, furazolidone and amoxycillin for the treatment of H. pylori infection in Colombia. METHODS: Thirty patients with histologically documented H. pylori infection received the combination of bismuth subcitrate 240 mg b.d., furzolidone 100 mg q.d.s. and amoxycillin 500 mg q.d.s. for 14 days. Four or more weeks after ending therapy patients were re-endoscoped and gastric biopsies were obtained and examined using the Genta stain. Each slide was scored for presence, absence and density of H. pylori, active and chronic inflammation, intestinal metaplasia, erosions and atrophy. Cure was defined as the absence of H. pylori. RESULTS: All patients completed the course of therapy. Twenty-five patients were cured (86%, 95% CI: 65-94%). Mild, well-tolerated side-effects were reported by six patients (20%). CONCLUSIONS: This combination of bismuth, furazolidone and amoxycillin fulfills the criteria for successful H. pylori therapy and appears particularly well suited for developing countries since it is simple, inexpensive and effective. Furazolidone-containing therapies may become especially useful in the face of a world-wide increase in H. pylori resistance to metronidazole and macrolides.
