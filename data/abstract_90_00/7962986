Polymicrobial infections are characterized by the presence of micro-organisms from more than one group of bacteria. Empirical treatment of polymicrobial infections requires an agent active against both anaerobic and aerobic/facultative bacteria. An aminoglycoside used in combination with an anti-anaerobe agent is commonly used to treat polymicrobial infections. However, aminoglycoside nephrotoxicity and treatment failures raise questions about the use of such regimens. Among non-aminoglycoside treatment regimens such as penicillin and cephalosporins, effectiveness has been compromised by bacteria producing extended spectrum beta-lactamases. Cefoxitin shows satisfactory results for treatment of intra-abdominal infections. Other studies have shown good results with imipenem, cefotetan and piperacillin used as single agents. Piperacillin/tazobactam, a new combination broad-spectrum antibiotic and potent beta-lactamase inhibitor, can be used for the treatment of infections caused by piperacillin-sensitive micro-organisms as well as beta-lactamase-producing, piperacillin-resistant organisms. This broad-spectrum activity is appropriate for infections traditionally treated empirically by double or triple antibiotic therapy.
