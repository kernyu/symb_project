In ovarian cancer patients intraperitoneal chemotherapy confers pharmacokinetic advantages and appears an attractive way to improve the efficacy of certain antineoplastic agents. Intraperitoneal carboplatin and interferon alpha have been separately evaluated in ovarian cancer "with promising results". We report a phase I-II pilot trial of intraperitoneal carboplatin 400 mg/sqm plus interferon alpha 25 x 10(6) U q 28 d in 16 patients (pts) previously treated with intravenous cisplatin based chemotherapy. All the patients had relapsed (11 pts) or refractory (5 pts) disease; residual tumors were less than 2 cm in 10 pts and greater than 2 cm in 6 pts. Local and general toxicities were moderate, with neither WHO grade 4, nor neurotoxicity and ototoxicity. Myelotoxicity was the most frequent side effect. Among 14 evaluable pts, objective responses were observed in 6 pts (42.8%) including 3 pts with pathologically confirmed complete response (21.4%); six more pts presented prolonged disease-free survival. Response occurred in both categories of pts with greater than or less than 2 cm residual disease, also in pts refractory to prior intravenous cisplatin. The proper role of intraperitoneal treatment cannot be exactly defined without large randomized trials designed to compare intraperitoneal to intravenous drug administrations.
