We have fused the open reading frames of his3-complementing genes from Saccharomyces kluyveri and Schizosac-charomyces pombe to the strong TEF gene promotor of the filamentous fungus Ashbya gossypii. Both chimeric modules and the cognate S. kluyveri HIS3 gene were tested in transformations of his3 S. cerevisiae strains using PCR fragments flanked by 40 bp target guide sequences. The 1.4 kb chimeric Sz. pombe module (HIS3MX6) performed best. With less than 5% incorrectly targeted transformants, it functions as reliably as the widely used geniticin resistance marker kanMX. The rare false-positive His+ transformants seem to be due to non-homologous recombination rather than to gene conversion of the mutated endogenous his3 allele. We also cloned the green fluorescent protein gene from Aequorea victoria into our pFA-plasmids with HIS3MX6 and kanMX markers. The 0.9 kb GFP reporters consist of wild-type GFP or GFP-S65T coding sequences, lacking the ATG, fused to the S. cerevisiae ADH1 terminator. PCR-synthesized 2.4 kb-long double modules flanked by 40-45 bp-long guide sequences were successfully targeted to the carboxy-terminus of a number of S. cerevisiae genes. We could estimate that only about 10% of the transformants carried inactivating mutations in the GFP reporter.
