BACKGROUND: This study evaluated 6 types of glove materials for resistance to permeation by a 7.5% hydrogen peroxide liquid chemical germicide. METHODS: Based on American Society for Testing and Materials Method F739-96, a small piece of glove material was placed in the center of a dual chamber test cell. The challenge and collection chambers of the test cell were filled with the hydrogen peroxide test chemical and the collecting medium (deionized water), respectively. Chemical permeation was determined by measuring the concentration of hydrogen peroxide in the collection medium at various time intervals. RESULTS: Both the polyvinylchloride and disposable latex examination gloves at 4.5 mil thickness provided less than 30 minutes of protection from hydrogen peroxide. The natural rubber latex glove at 16.5 mil lasted for 8 hours without any detectable penetration. Neoprene (15 mil) and nitrile butyl rubber (18 mil) both provided excellent protection throughout the 8-hour test period. CONCLUSION: Disposable latex examination gloves should be used for short-term exposure to hydrogen peroxide solutions. Thicker rubber latex gloves provided adequate protection and necessary dexterity for conducting intricate tasks. The level of protection depends largely on the thickness and quality of the glove material.
