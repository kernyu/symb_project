Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) preconditioning induces cardiac resistance to subsequent LPS or ischemia. This study tested the hypothesis that resistance to LPS and resistance to ischemia are two manifestations of cardiac cross-resistance which may involve reprogramming of cardiac gene expression. Rats were preconditioned with a single dose of LPS (0.5 mg/kg ip). Cardiac resistance to LPS was examined with a subsequent LPS challenge. Cardiac resistance to ischemia was determined by subjecting hearts to ischemia-reperfusion. Total RNA was extracted from myocardium for Northern analysis of mRNAs encoding protooncoproteins, antioxidant enzymes, and contractile protein isoforms. Rats preconditioned with LPS 1-7 days earlier acquired cardiac resistance to endotoxemic depression. This resistance temporally correlated with resistance to ischemia. Pretreatment with cycloheximide (0.5 mg/kg ip) abolished resistance to both LPS and ischemia. LPS preconditioning induced the expression of c-jun and c-fos mRNAs. LPS also transiently increased mRNAs encoding catalase and Mn-containing superoxide dismutase. The expression of both alpha- and beta-myosin heavy chain mRNAs was upregulated, whereas the expression of cardiac alpha-actin mRNA was suppressed. We conclude that 1) LPS induces sustained cardiac resistance to both LPS and ischemia, 2) resistance to ischemia and resistance to LPS seem to be two mechanistically indistinct components of cardiac cross-resistance, and 3) the cardiac cross-resistance is associated with reprogramming of myocardial gene expression.
