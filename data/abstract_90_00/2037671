The E Test (AB Biodisk, Solna, Sweden) is a new method for performing antimicrobial susceptibility tests. It consists of an impervious carrier (5- by 50-mm strip) with a predefined antimicrobic gradient which is placed on an inoculated agar plate and processed like a disk diffusion test. Results are generated directly as MICs from a continuous concentration gradient covering 15 twofold dilutions, and MICs are read where the edge of the inhibition zone intersects the strip. We compared the E Test with disk diffusion, broth microdilution, and agar dilution tests by using a challenge set of 195 gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria for 14 antimicrobial agents. Also, disk diffusion, broth microdilution, and agar dilution tests were compared with each other. All test method comparisons gave greater than 94% agreement for the category of susceptibility. The E Test category agreement with disk diffusion and broth microdilution was 95.1%, and with agar dilution it was 95.2%. The E Test results were as reliable as the results obtained by the standard antimicrobial susceptibility testing methods.
