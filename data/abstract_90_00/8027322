Because mycoplasmas may be a cofactor in the progression of human immunodeficiency virus infection to AIDS, their susceptibilities to antibiotics need to be known in the event that appropriate therapy is required. The mycoplasmas studied were a stock culture strain of Mycoplasma fermentans, two strains of M. fermentans isolated from patients with AIDS, M. fermentans var. incognitus, Mycoplasma penetrans, and Mycoplasma pirum. The antibiotics tested were doxycycline, tetracycline, clindamycin, ofloxacin, erythromycin, azithromycin, and clarithromycin at levels consistent with the attainable levels in serum. By the macrodilution metabolic inhibition method, all six mycoplasma strains were susceptible to doxycycline, tetracycline, clindamycin, ofloxacin, azithromycin, and clarithromycin. M. penetrans was susceptible to erythromycin. The M. fermentans strains and M. pirum were resistant to erythromycin. The macrodilution metabolic inhibition method results showed agreement with the Sensititre Gram Positive MIC Panel results for tetracycline, clindamycin, and erythromycin. MICs of clarithromycin for all six mycoplasma isolates tested were low, indicating susceptibility.
