Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is recognised as an important cause of nosocomial infection. The spread of some MRSA epidemic clones is well documented. In Brazil, and more recently in Portugal, a considerable number of hospital infections has been caused by a unique multiresistant MRSA clone designated as the Brazilian epidemic clone. This paper describes the spread of this clone in hospitals in two cities in Argentina.
