Children with innate immunodeficiencies may be at high risk for early development of ganciclovir-resistant human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection after bone marrow transplantation (BMT). For early and frequent monitoring of the occurrence of ganciclovir resistance-associated mutations in codons of the UL97 gene, a panel of previously described restriction assays was expanded for use on codons 591, 592, and 603. This technique enabled detection of suddenly emerging ganciclovir-resistant HCMV after BMT in a 7-year-old child with a T cell defect. Resistance emerged among the isolation of a ganciclovir-sensitive HCMV strain 32 days after transplantation, the first detection of genotypical resistance at day 44, and the isolation of resistant HCMV (ID50>12 microM) at day 54. Simple and yet comprehensive methods for therapy surveillance may be important in this patient group, in which the restriction assays proved useful.
