BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis in HIV infected patients does not carry a worse therapeutic response rate. Treatment failure is usually due to incomplete schedule, with development of acquired resistance. Two patients with HIV infection and disseminated tuberculosis who developed fatal meningitis are presented. METHODS: In vitro studies of sensitivity to anti-tuberculous drugs were carried out, using the proportions method. RESULTS: Following a good initial evolution, both patients were readmitted with tuberculous meningitis resistant to isoniazide in both and to rifampicin in one of the patients. In one patient, the original strain (which was sensitive) was available. In this patient, changes in the treatment were performed in the initial phase. CONCLUSIONS: The importance of anti-tuberculous multiple therapy, particularly in the initial phases, for HIV positive patients is crucial. The lengthen of admission when good patient's compliance is in question, but also to avoid, whenever possible, changes in treatment are important measures in this stage. Meningitis may occur as a form of therapeutic failure and its cure may be difficult if the strains are resistant.
