Ceftriaxone is active against many gram-negative bacillary uropathogens. It achieves very high levels in urine and proximate tissue following single daily doses. Clinical and bacteriologic results in infections due to susceptible organisms have been excellent. Additional comparative studies with longer follow-up may assist in further delineating the relative role of ceftriaxone in management of infections of the urinary tract.
