The rates of muscle glucose uptake of lean and obese Zucker rats were assessed via hindlimb perfusion under basal conditions (no insulin), in the presence of a maximal insulin concentration (10 mU/ml), and after electrically stimulated muscle contraction in the absence of insulin. The perfusate contained 28 mM glucose and 7.5 microCi/mmol of 2-deoxy-D-[3H-(G)]glucose. Glucose uptake rates in the soleus (slow-twitch oxidative fibers), red gastrocnemius (fast-twitch oxidative-glycolytic fibers), and white gastrocnemius (fast-twitch glycolytic fibers) under basal conditions and after electrically stimulated muscle contraction were not significantly different between the lean and obese rats. However, the rate of glucose uptake during insulin stimulation was significantly lower for obese than for lean rats in all three fiber types. Significant correlations were found for insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and glucose transporter protein isoform (GLUT-4) content of soleus, red gastrocnemius, and white gastrocnemius of lean (r = 0.79) and obese (r = 0.65) rats. In contrast, the relationships between contraction-stimulated glucose uptake and muscle GLUT-4 content of lean and obese rats were negligible because of inordinately low contraction-stimulated glucose uptakes by the solei. These results suggest that maximal skeletal muscle glucose uptake of obese Zucker rats is resistant to stimulation by insulin but not to contractile activity. In addition, the relationship between contraction-stimulated glucose uptake and GLUT-4 content appears to be fiber-type specific.
