The in vitro activities of 12 beta-lactam agents against 100 thermophilic Campylobacter strains were tested. Beta-Lactamase production was detected in 88% of all strains tested. Clavulanic acid was the best inhibitor by susceptibility testing. The beta-lactams which displayed high levels of in vitro activity against Campylobacter isolates were imipenem, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, and cefepime and, to a lesser degree, amoxicillin, ampicillin, and cefotaxime.
