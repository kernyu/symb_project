One hundred and thirty three strains of Bacteroides fragilis group isolated from clinical specimen were tested for beta-lactamase activity against five beta-lactam antibiotics, ampicillin, cefaloridin, cefuroxime, cefotaxime and cefoxitin. The Minimal Inhibitory Concentration of antibiotics was determined using the agar dilution method. Beta-lactamase production was detected by a microbiological method in 128 of the 133 (96%) strains. The detected beta-lactamases had a broad-spectrum activity, hydrolyzing both penicillins and cephalosporins (101 strains). Some strains had a wide activity against beta-lactam antibiotics, including cefoxitin (7 strains); among these strains, 3 were found hydrolyzing imipenem.
