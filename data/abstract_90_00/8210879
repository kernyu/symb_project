Based on a survey, results on resistant tubercle bacilli in Switzerland during October 1987 through April 1991 are presented. In 94% of 2482 tuberculosis cases reported, susceptibility testing results have been available. The radiometric BACTEC technique was used in 76%. Resistance was detected radiometrically for INH in 7%, for rifampin in 1.9% and for ethambutol in 0.7%. The age-specific resistance among Swiss was 12% in the youngest and 3% in the oldest age group. In patients from South American and from Far Eastern countries, INH and rifampin resistance was the highest. Resistance was found in 5.7% of the Swiss and in 7.5% of all. In addition, suggestions for the surveillance of resistant tubercle bacilli have been made.
