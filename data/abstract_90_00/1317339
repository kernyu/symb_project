A mouse hepatitis virus-3 strain subcultured in our laboratory is a unique experimental model in which to study virus-induced liver steatosis. This strain produces massive lipid deposition not only in sensitive adult BALB/c mice but also (though less extensive) in virus-resistant adult A/J mice. Biochemical determinations have shown that this steatosis is characterized by an increased amount of neutral lipids (sterols and triglycerides) in infected livers of BALB/c mice and by a smaller increase in those of A/J mice. However, the relative percentage of cholesterol and triglycerides is similar in both strains. Liver phospholipid content was significantly decreased in both strains of mice. To discriminate between cytoplasmic and membrane cholesterol content in different types of liver cells, an ultrastructural study was performed with filipin, a specific cholesterol marker. This study shows on one hand an important increase in the cholesterol in the hepatocytes of BALB/c mice and a smaller increase in those of A/J mice, in agreement with biochemical data. However, marked cholesterol decrease and abnormal cholesterol distribution were observed in the endothelial liver cells of infected BALB/c mice. This decreased cholesterol content probably led to higher fluidity of these membranes, which could be related to the important drop in the number of endothelial cell fenestrae observed after mouse hepatitis virus-3 infection. Because in A/J infected mice neither a decrease in the amount and distribution of cholesterol nor decreased fenestration were observed in endothelial liver cells, these findings could be correlated with the resistance of these mice to the infection.
