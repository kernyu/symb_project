Nature, structure, occurrence and drug resistance of 160 strains of Y. pseudotuberculosis and 60 strains of Y. enterocolitica isolated from various sources within 1986-1988 were studied. In the strains of Y. pseudotuberculosis, the cell composition with respect to the requirements in calcium ions as well as the plasmid profiles with determination of the molecular weights of the plasmids in the antibiotic sensitive and resistant pathogens and R(+)-transconjugants were investigated. Some molecular genetic properties of the Yersinia R plasmids were also investigated. Antibiotic polyresistant strains of Y. enterocolitica were the most frequent donors of the R plasmids while the strains of Y. pseudotuberculosis were less frequently the donors, in the resistance pattern of which there were more frequent streptomycin and tetracycline resistance determinants. The conjugative R plasmids of Y. pseudotuberculosis were characterized by strict control of replication, repressed frequency of transfers, and a molecular weight of about 47 MD. Their replicones as a rule contained streptomycin and tetracycline markers determining resistance to streptomycin and tetracycline at the levels of 1250 and 156 micrograms/ml, respectively.
