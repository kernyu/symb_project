Thrombin-induced platelet microbicidal protein (tPMP) exerts potent in vitro microbicidal activity against pathogens commonly found in the bloodstream, including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Candida albicans. Localized platelet release of tPMP may be important in defense against infections involving the vascular endothelium caused by tPMP-susceptible organisms. In contrast, pathogens capable of surviving in the presence of tPMP could then exploit the platelet as an adhesive surface for attachment to damaged endothelium. To examine these hypotheses, we derived a tPMP-resistant (tPMP(r)) C. albicans strain from its tPMP-sensitive (tPMP(s)) parental strains were equivalent in vitro as assessed by genotyping (electrophoretic karyotype and restriction endonuclease analysis of genomic DNA), biotyping, germination, platelet aggregation, adherence to vascular endothelial cells, and growth characteristics. In addition, the tPMP(r) phenotype was stable following multiple in vitro and in vivo passages. We then investigated the in vivo relevance of tPMP susceptibility on endovascular infection using a rabbit model of endocarditis and hematogenous dissemination. Rabbits with transaortic catheters (n = 15 in each group) were challenged with either the tPMP(s) or tPMP(r) C. albicans strain. All rabbits developed C. albicans-induced endocarditis, as determined by the presence of infected vegetations. In rabbits challenged with tPMP(s) strain (P < 0.001). These results were seen in the absence of differences in either initial adherence of strains to cardiac valves or vegetation weights. Furthermore, although these C. albicans strains induced equivalent rates and extent of hematogenous renal infection, only the tPMP(r) strain disseminated hematogenously to the spleen (15 of 15 rabbits) versus 0 of 15 [tpmp(s) strain]; P < 0.0001). Thus, tPMP(r) C. albicans caused more-severe endocarditis and produced greater metastatic sequelae than the tPMP(s) counterpart.
