Larval and adult extracts from isolates of Haemonchus contortus were assayed for specific [3H]levamisole binding activity. All of the tissue preparations displayed [3H]levamisole binding sites. The sensitive isolate SE and resistant isolate RJ showed no differences in larval and adult binding data. Larval SE extracts had higher receptor density (Bmax = 648 fmol mg-1) and dissociation constant (Kd = 1.28 microM) for [3H]levamisole than larval extracts of the American isolate RUSA (Bmax = 87 fmol mg-1 and Kd = 0.15 microM). Extracts of adult SE and RUSA isolates contain as much as 327 fmol mg-1 of protein and 205 fmol mg-1 of protein, respectively, and similar dissociation constants (Kd = 0.77 microM and Kd = 0.81 microM, respectively). There was a good correlation between specific binding activity of larval and adult extracts in both SE and RUSA isolates. The nicotinic cholinergic antagonist alpha-bungarotoxin had no effects in either isolate on [3H]levamisole binding activity. The results confirm that levamisole acts at a cholinergic receptor in H. contortus, and suggest that target site modification could be involved in the development of levamisole resistance.
