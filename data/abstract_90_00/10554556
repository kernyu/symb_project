Eleven patients (12 ears) with acute otitis media associated with raised bone conduction were studied. The patients were from 19 to 70 years old and came to our hospital between November 1996 through May 1997. Pure tone audiometry revealed mixed hearing loss, but there was no bullous myringitis in all cases. They were treated by oral or intravenous antibiotics, steroids, and myringotomy. Bacteriological examination was done in seven cases, and revealed penicillin resistant Streptococcus pnumoniae in three cases. Complete recovery of hearing loss was obtained in 10 of 12 ears, but sensorineural hearing loss remained in 2 patients. Bacteriological examination and pure tone audiometry in acute otitis media are important for detecting the severity of the disease, determining the administration of steroids, and for the selection of antibiotics.
