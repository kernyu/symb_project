Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 showed increased phenotypic resistance to imipenem, panipenem, and biapenem specifically in the presence of salicylate. The antipseudomonal activity of carbapenems was reduced in proportion to the concentration of salicylate. This resistance was transient and nonheritable. The synthesis of the outer membrane protein D2 (OprD or OprD2) in P. aeruginosa PAO1 was inhibited by 4 to 32 mM salicylate in the bacterial growth medium, whereas no changes in any other outer membrane proteins were observed. These results indicate that salicylate suppresses the synthesis of OprD and therefore reduces the antipseudomonal activity of carbapenems. Under these conditions, one carbapenem--meropenem--is still active against P. aeruginosa, which indicates that meropenem can pass through the outer membrane via both the D2 channel and another undefined route(s).
