The in-vitro susceptibility pattern to newer beta lactams namely Ticer/Clav, Azlocillin, Piperacillin and Imipenem was determined with 50 clinical strains isolated from neutropenic patients with strains isolated from neutropenic patients with sepsis, with an objective of evolving a strategy for empirical antibiotic therapy for febrile neutropenic patients. The MIC90 value for Imipenem for the Gram negative bacilli tested, other than Pseudomonas was < 0.25 mcg/ml therapy revealing a high degree of susceptibility, while for Ps. aeruginosa and related species MIC50 and MIV90 values were 2.0 and 64.0 micrograms/ml respectively. A comparatively lower degree of susceptibility was found among Gram negative bacilli included in the study to ticar/clavu, azlocillin and piperacillin indicating a moderate degree of resistance to these antibiotics. The data from this study suggests that (i) Ureidopenicillins with an aminoglycoside should be effective therapy for proven Pseudomonas and other Gram negative sepsis in febrile neutropenic patients. (ii) Imipenem would be the antibiotic of choice in Gram negative bacterial sepsis in febrile neutropenic patients where the organism is resistant to cephalosporins and ureidopenicillins.
