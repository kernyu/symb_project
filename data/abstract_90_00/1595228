178 new cases of tuberculosis of the lungs and pleura have been treated within the period of four years (1985-1988) in military medical institutions of the Y.P.A. The patients were classified by random selection in two therapeutical groups. Two six-month regimens were applied with the same drugs except for the fourth one which was used in the initial period only (EHRZ and SHRZ). Both applied therapeutical combinations were equally successful. All patients achieved negative cultures at least three months after onset of chemotherapy. Relapses occurred in 4 (2.3%) of patients during the period of follow-up for at least 2 and the most 5.5 years after the end of therapy. The toxic effects were tolerable. The drug resistance was found in 25 of 134 (18.6%) patients, the most common to one drug.
