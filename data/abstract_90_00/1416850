During the second quarter each of 1988, 1989, and 1990, a French collaborative study group, including 12 university hospital laboratories, surveyed the resistance to beta-lactams of clinical isolates from hospitalized patients: consecutively, 10,641, 10,692, and 9,382 isolates were tested. The distribution of bacterial species over time was similar in each laboratory. The susceptibilities of microorganisms to amoxicillin, ticarcillin, cephalothin, cefoxitin, cefotaxime (CTX), ceftazidime (CAZ), aztreonam (ATM), and imipenem (IPM) were measured by the disk diffusion method in accordance with the recommendations of the Antibiogram Committee of the French Society for Microbiology. Five reference strains were included for quality control. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases were detected by the synergistic effect of the combination of clavulanic acid-amoxicillin with CTX, CAZ, and ATM in the double-diffusion test. A synergistic effect with CTX, CAZ, and ATM was detected for 1.5% of all strains, mainly those of Klebsiella pneumoniae (13.3%). For this species, the synergy test enabled the detection of roughly 50% of the resistant strains misclassified as susceptible on the basis of interpretative standards. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases disseminated in 1990 in most enterobacterial species but at a low frequency. Important variations in the percentages of resistant strains were observed in terms of bacterial species, hospitals, and wards. However, when the total number of strains was considered, the percentages of resistance to newer beta-lactams remained low.
