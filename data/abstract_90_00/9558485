The purpose of this study was to elucidate the differential contribution of catalase and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) to H2O2 scavenging in cultured human dermal fibroblasts. Responses of the cells in terms of both enzyme activities were examined by using two sorts of inhibitors, 3-amino-1H-1,2,4-triazole (AT) for catalase and DL-buthionine-[S,R]-sulfoximine (BSO) for GSH-Px, under exposure to H2O2 or ultraviolet (UV) B radiation. AT treatment resulted in a decrease in H2O2 scavenging activity, while BSO treatment did not affect H2O2 scavenging. When fibroblasts were exposed to a low concentration of H2O2 (100 microM). AT treatment resulted in a significant decrease in cell survival, but BSO treatment did not affect survival. At higher concentrations of H2O2 ranging from 500 microM to 1 mM, BSO-treated fibroblasts showed reduced survival. In addition, AT treatment was much more cytotoxic in the presence of UVB than BSO treatment. The intracellular levels of H2O2 in fibroblasts treated with AT or BSO were also determined. BSO-treated cells showed similar H2O2 levels to control cells, but the intracellular H2O2 levels of AT-treated fibroblasts were 1.4-fold higher than found in control cells. These results with human dermal fibroblasts indicate that catalase acts as a primary defence against oxidative stress from exogenous or endogenous H2O2 at low concentrations. In contrast, GSH-Px helps protect the cell from damage during exposure to high concentrations of H2O2.
