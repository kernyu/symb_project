Normal and malignant cell lines, sensitive and resistant to adriamycin, have been treated with H2O2 to look for the possibility of protection from the cytotoxic action of adriamycin on the cells. Pre-treatment of adriamycin-resistant cells with H2O2 partially protects them against the cytotoxicity of adriamycin.
