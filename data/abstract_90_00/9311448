The multidrug resistance (MDR)-neutralizing and cytotoxic properties of 16 novel tetramethylpiperidine (TMP)-substituted phenazines were compared with those of clofazimine and B669 using a P-glycoprotein (P-gp)-expressing undifferentiated, human leukemia cell line (K562/MMB). Unchlorinated TMP-substituted phenazine molecules were more cytotoxic than their chlorinated counterparts, while the halogenated molecules, especially those with chlorine atoms at position 3 on the aniline and phenyl rings, were less cytotoxic but more effective as chemosensitizing, P-gp-neutralizing agents. One of the TMP-substituted phenazines, B4121, increased the sensitivity of K562/MMB cells to vinblastine by 100-fold. TMP-substituted phenazines are a novel class of pharmacologic anti-cancer agents with both direct cytotoxic, as well as MDR-neutralizing anti-tumor properties.
