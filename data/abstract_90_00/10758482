The epidermal cells of hypocotyls from etiolated cucumber seedlings are not constitutively competent for elicitation of the rapid H2O2 defense response. However, elicitor competence developed while conditioning the surface-abraded seedlings by rotating them in buffer for 4 h. Competence development was greatly potentiated by inducers of systemic acquired resistance and suppressed by specific inhibitors of proteasome activity, clastolactacystin beta-lactone (LAC) and carboxybenzoyl-L-leucyl-L-leucyl-L-leucinal (LLL). In the freshly abraded seedlings, chitinase gene activation became evident approximately 4 h after elicitor addition. Accumulation of chitinase mRNA was enhanced upon conditioning prior to elicitation and was inhibited by LAC and LLL, indicating that the process which leads to H2O2 elicitation competence is also superimposed on the elicitation of chitinase mRNA. LAC and LLL caused an accumulation of ubiquitin-conjugated proteins and enhanced the expression of a proteasome alpha-subunit, suggesting that proteasome activity was specifically inhibited and that the effect observed on gene expression was not due to impaired gene induction in general. Together, our results suggest that the ubiquitin-proteasome system may play a crucial role in a process which switches the signaling pathway for diverse plant defense responses into a functional state, as is known for many basic cellular processes in both animals and yeast.
