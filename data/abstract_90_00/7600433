The therapeutic results of 41 cases of S. aureus infected burn wound (average 2.1% TBSA, approximately 200 cm2) treated with Mupirocin are reported in this paper. The effects of Mupirocin was obviously superior to that of SD-Ag used in control group. During the observation period the total effective rate of the studied group was 88.9% (control group: 70%, P < 0.05) and the bacterial clearance rate of S. aureus from the wound was 88.8% (control group: 40% P < 0.05). The sensitivity of 30 strains of S. aureus isolated from burn wounds to 11 varieties of antibiotics indicated that the sensitive rate to Mupirocin was as high as 92.68%, only lower that Vanconmycin. The bacteriological assay (MIC < or = 0.25 mg/L, MIC < or = 4 mg/L) also showed high sensitivity of S. aureus to Mupirocin. We suggest Mupirocin be the first choice of topical antibacterial agents for burn wound with S. aureus infection, especially for infection with MRSA.
