We have developed a PCR-based method to detect macrolide resistance and the virulence gene cagA in Helicobacter pylori within 24 h, thereby improving the lengthy process of culture-based approaches. Total DNA was prepared directly from stomach biopsy specimens. The procedure proved to be rapid and reliable and could be utilized for diagnostic purposes.
