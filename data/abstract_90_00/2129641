The effect of tripotassium dicitrato bismuthate (De-Nol) on the breakdown of the gastric mucus barrier was investigated by measuring the output of mucus glycoprotein in pentagastrin-stimulated secretion from 13 patients before and after treatment for peptic ulcer, and by examining the accumulation of dialysable peptides and amino acids (DPAA) in stimulated secretion from ten of these patients. The accumulation of DPAA was significantly reduced after De-Nol (by 54%) and to a greater extent than was the output of mucus glycoprotein (by 27%). These observations are consistent with a decrease in the rate of breakdown of the mucus barrier as a result of De-Nol treatment. De-Nol significantly reduced pepsin output (by 32%) in the same group of patients. Comparison of the change in pepsin output with the change in accumulation of DPAA in stimulated juice indicated that De-Nol increases the resistance of the mucus barrier to acid-pepsin proteolysis and/or inhibits the secretion of amino acids and peptides from gastric mucosa.
