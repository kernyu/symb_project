Thirty three patients with acute progressive chronic pulmonary tuberculosis who were admitted to be intolerable since they had gross damage and gained no benefits from chemotherapy due to the multidrug resistance of Mycobacteria tuberculosis were given an additional course of intravenous dissolved ozone administration (PO3). Before PO3 administration, more than half (57.4%) of the patients received only 1 or 2 antituberculous drugs (ethambutole and ethionamide or ethambutole and oprofloxacin). PO3 produced a pronounced disintoxifying effect, resulting in cessation of bacterial isolation. The stabilization of a tuberculous process was verified by clinical, X-ray, and laboratory studies in 75.8% of patients. This made it possible to perform bulky operations on the lung. When there was a postoperative progression of the underlying process in the single lung, chemotherapy was supplemented by intravenous PO3, which also promoted the stabilization of the process. The use of PO3 expands the spectrum of used agents and enhances the impact of chemotherapy in the treatment of patients isolating multidrug-resistant M. tuberculosis in both pre- and postoperative periods, this increases the rate of operability in the most serious patients.
