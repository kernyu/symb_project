The bactericidal activities of arbekacin (ABK), vancomycin (VCM), gentamicin (GM) and netilmicin (NTL) in mixed culture with Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were examined using an in vitro computer programmed pharmacokinetic simulation system and also the protective effect of these agents on systemic infection in neutropenic mice was examined. In a mixed culture of S. aureus No. 235 (MRSA) and P. aeruginosa E7, ABK showed a strong bactericidal activity and an inhibition of regrowth against both bacteria, and GM and NTL showed similar effects. On the other hand, VCM showed a bactericidal activity against S. aureus No. 235, but not against P. aeruginosa. In the protective study, ABK was evidently more effective than GM, NTL or VCM against a systemic mixed infection of mice with S. aureus No. 235 and P. aeruginosa E7. In brief, the ED50 values of ABK, VCM, GM and NTL were 19.5, > 100, 40.5 and 45.2 mg/kg, respectively.
