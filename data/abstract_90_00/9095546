Of the streptomycin-dependent strains, SD 510 isolated from Salmonella typhimurium TA 98 provided a sharp response to mutagens without any metabolic activation; This fact is in contrast to the original test of Ames in which S-9 mix is usually added for routine screening of mutagens. The desmutagenic activity of the Maillard reaction products of glycine with glucose and of lysine with glucose was studied. The Maillard reaction products were prepared by heating at various temperatures lower than 120 degrees C for 30 min at pH 7.0, and at 120 degrees C for 30 min under various pH conditions, and their desmutagenic activity against Trp-P1 toward the SD 510 Salmonella typhimurium TA 98 streptomycin-dependent strain was assayed in the absence of S-9 mix. This SD strain is effective with its strong response and would serve as a reliable indicator organism for assessing the desmutagenicity of Maillard reaction products in the presence or absence of S-9 mix.
