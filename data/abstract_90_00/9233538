Methanococcus maripaludis is a strict anaerobe that utilizes H2 or formate as an electron donor for CO2 reduction to methane. Recent progress in development of genetic systems in this archaebacterium makes it an excellent model system for molecular and biochemical studies. This progress includes development of methods for growth on solid medium, enriching auxotrophic mutants, efficient transformation, and random insertional inactivation of genes. Genetic markers for both puromycin and neomycin resistance are available. Lastly, a shuttle vector has been constructed from a cryptic methanococcal plasmid. These technical advances made it possible to utilize genetic approaches for the study of autotrophic CO2 assimilation in methanococci.
