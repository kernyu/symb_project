The emergence of antibiotic-resistant pathogens has been an ongoing concern of infection-control and infectious disease practitioners.

Efforts to contain the problem of infections caused by drug-resistant organisms have two objectives: to optimize antibiotic use and to prevent transmission through effective infection-control practices.
