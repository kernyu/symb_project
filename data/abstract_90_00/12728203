An epidemiological survey on 2859 bacterial strains was performed in the first nine months of 1998, to verify the predominant susceptibility to ciprofloxacin of the main microrganisms isolated in this period. Our results showed that the use of ciprofloxacin would probably decrease in future because of increasing resistance with respect to previous period. An increase in antimicrobial resistance occurred in some gram positive (as Enterococci) and especially gram negative strains such as Escherichia coli, that are common and frequent bacterial causes of infections in hospital and in the community. The study demonstrated that there are also interesting and important variations in resistance patterns with respect to previous studies
