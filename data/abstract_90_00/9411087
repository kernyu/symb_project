In the modern world, as refrigerated storage has replaced lactic acid fermentation methods of food preservation, we no longer ingest large quantities of live lactobacilli with our food, but relatively large numbers of potentially pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria instead. In the brave new world, antibiotics are used as growth-promoting additives in animal feed in every country but Sweden. The antibiotics used in Europe at low dosages, and exempt from prescription requirements, include macrolides, streptogramins and nitro-imidazoles. There is reason to believe that avoparcin, recently banned in Europe as an antibiotic animal feed additive, has contributed to the occurrence of vancomycin-resistant enterococci in humans. Animal foodstuffs production in Europe and the USA is so intensive that it provides very favourable conditions for the spread of bacteria. Pig, cattle and poultry breeding in Europe are beset by formidable difficulties in the form of Salmonella infections, which constitute not only a hygiene but also a clinical problem. Sweden, the bravest of brave new worlds, faces an increase in the influx of domestic animals and foodstuffs from other countries, and in general less restrictive regulations concerning food production and animal husbandry, but reduced powers of control. Thus, we may expect problems both with pathogens (traditional ones such as Salmonella, and potential ones such as food-spoilage Gram-negative bacteria), and with antibiotic-resistant bacteria in our food-stuffs, to become greater.
