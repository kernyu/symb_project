Fusidic acid was shown to be effective in vitro against 30 clinical isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis at concentrations of 32-64 mg/l, concentrations which are readily achieved in serum. All but one of 17 Mycobacterium avium complex strains were resistant to fusidic acid at concentrations up to 64 mg/l. However, synergistic effects were shown for 11 of the 17 strains when fusidic acid was combined with ethambutol. Five of the strains were fully susceptible to the combination of fusidic acid (64 mg/l) and ethambutol (4 mg/l). It is suggested that fusidic acid should be evaluated clinically as a potential supplementary drug for treatment of mycobacterial infections.
