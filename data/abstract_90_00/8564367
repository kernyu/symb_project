The presence of antibiotic resistant bacteria was revealed among bacteria isolated from non carbonated mineral waters bottled in plastic (PVC) and in glass containers. Heterotrophic plate count values ranged between < 10 and 4.3 x 10(3) and between < 10 and 1.2 x 10(4) colony forming units/ml for the waters bottled in PVC and glass, respectively. The greatest resistance to a single antibiotic, 39.1% of 320 isolates from mineral waters, was found for nalidixic acid. Resistance to the other antibiotics was as follows: ampicillin (26.2%), bacitracin (19.7%), cotrimoxazole (18.7%), streptomycin (15.0%), tetracycline (14.4%), gentamycin (11.6%), chloramphenicol and rifampin (9.7%). The strains resistant to two or more antibiotics (multiple antibiotic resistant, MAR) provided 51% of the total isolates. Identification of 127 MAR strains showed that in the mineral waters gram-positive cocci dominated. The second, third and fourth group of identified MAR phenotypes were, in order to importance, gram-negative non-fermentative rods, gram-positive rods and gram-negative fermentative rods. The importance of the antibiotic resistant bacteria in mineral water is discussed.
