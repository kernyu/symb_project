The determinants encoding resistance to kanamycin, neomycin and streptomycin on plasmid pWBG628 have been shown to undergo recombination independent transposition to the chromosome of Staphylococcus aureus. Transposition of the determinants to a target plasmid corresponded to transfer of a 4.5 kb element which has been designated Tn3854.
