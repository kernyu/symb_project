Psammaplin A, a natural bromotyrosine derivative from an associated form of two sponges (Poecillastra sp. and Jaspis sp.) was found to possess the antimicrobial effect on the Gram-positive bacteria, especially on methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The minimal inhibitory concentration of psammaplin A against twenty one MRSAs ranged from 0.781 to 6.25 microg/ml, while that of ciprofloxacin was 0.391-3.125 microg/ml. Psammaplin A could not bind to penicillin binding protein, but inhibited the DNA synthesis and the DNA gyrase activity with the respective 50% (DNA synthesis) and 100% (DNA gyrase) inhibitory concentration 2.83 and 100 microg/ml. These results indicate that psammaplin A has a considerable antibacterial activity, although restricted to a somewhat narrow range of bacteria, probably by inhibiting DNA gyrase.
