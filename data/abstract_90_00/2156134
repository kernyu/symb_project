The effects of polymyxins (Pmx) B and E on smooth and rough Proteus mirabilis strains were investigated. P. mirabilis mutant R4/028 which completely lacked 4-amino-4-deoxy-L-arabinose was sensitive towards both polymyxins, and the other P. mirabilis strains investigated were resistant. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Pmx-sensitive R4/028 strain, binds 50% more Pmx B than LPS derived from resistant P. mirabilis strains. The presence of iodoacetamide, N-ethylmaleimide and chloramphenicol rendered the Pmx-resistant P. mirabilis strains sensitive towards both polymyxins.
