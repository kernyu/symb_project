Infective, third-stage (L3) larvae of Haemonchus contortus isolates resistant to ivermectin (IVM) show a decreased sensitivity to IVM-induced paralysis in vitro. The inhibition of larval motility by IVM can be detected in L3 larvae incubated in the dark on an agar matrix containing IVM, by the failure of affected larvae to move when stimulated by exposure to light. Optimally, avermectin (AVM) potency is quantified after three cycles, each involving storage in the dark for 24 h followed by a brief exposure to light. For IVM-susceptible isolates, a 50% inhibition of motility (LP50) was achieved with IVM concentrations between 0.30 and 0.49 microM, while LP50 values in IVM-resistant isolates ranged from 0.8 to 2.6 microM depending on the in vivo resistance status of the isolate. A limited study of structure-activity relationships within the AVM class indicated that in vitro inhibition of L3 motility was consistent with the known in vivo efficacy of each analogue. Resistance factors for IVM-resistant isolates were dependent on AVM structure with the more polar AVM B2 analogue being a particularly sensitive probe of IVM-resistance status.
