A collection of 24 rifampin-resistant clinical isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis with characterized RNA polymerase beta-subunit (rpoB) gene mutations was tested against the antimycobacterial agents rifampin, rifapentine, and KRM-1648 to correlate levels of resistance with specific rpoB genotypes. The results indicate that KRM-1648 is more active in vitro than rifampin and rifapentine, and its ability to overcome rifampin resistance in strains with four different genetic alterations may prove to be useful in understanding structure-function relationships.
