Fat redistribution (lipodystrophy) and metabolic anomalies are reported increasingly in HIV-infected patients being treated with protease inhibitors. The incidence of these side effects ranges from 5% to 75% in such patients, who often complain of spontaneous fat wasting in the face, arms, or legs, with or without central obesity. Hyperlipidemia and insulin resistance are almost always associated with lipodystrophy. We review the metabolic complications of antiretroviral therapies and discuss possible therapeutic interventions.
