The implementation, monitoring, and impact of a program to restrict vancomycin use are described. A vancomycin restriction program was implemented in February 1995 at an acute care teaching hospital after guidelines for vancomycin use were established by a multidisciplinary group. Pharmacists reviewed each vancomycin order, suggested alternative treatments when vancomycin use did not comply with the guidelines, and set duration limits for all orders. Orders requiring greater clinical experience for review were referred to a pharmacist or a physician in the division of infectious diseases. The program was monitored by an infectious diseases pharmacist. Data collected after the program was established showed that the volume of vancomycin use decreased substantially. Problems in enforcing the restriction program included administration of vancomycin for surgical prophylaxis before the order reached the pharmacy, continuing use of vancomycin for initial empirical treatment of febrile neutropenic and immunocompromised patients, inadequate tracking of the evaluations, and deficiencies in the evaluations related to a need for continuing education of the pharmacists about the program. Use of vancomycin decreased after a pharmacy-enforced restriction program was implemented.
