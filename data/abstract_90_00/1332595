Transposition of TnV and Tn5lac into Myxococcus xanthus yielded 8,381 kanamycin-resistant mutants that were tested for antibiotic TA production. Twenty-four of the mutants were nonproducers of TA (less than 0.4 ng/ml), and 3 produced a higher level (2.5 micrograms/ml) than the parent strain (1.5 micrograms/ml). For most of the strains, there was 100% cotransduction between kanamycin resistance and the altered TA phenotype. Southern blot analysis of restriction digests of the mutant DNA indicated that the transposons were inserted at different sites on the M. xanthus chromosome. The TA genes were mapped by cotransduction between pairs of mutants following replacement of the initial insert of one of the pair with the tetracycline resistance transposon Tn5-132. Nine of the 13 nonproducers tested were linked over a 36-kb stretch of the chromosome. There was no linkage between one of the overproducers and any of the nonproducers tested.
