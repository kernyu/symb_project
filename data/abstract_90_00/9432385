SETTING: In 1990, a 6-month short-course regimen (2 SHRZ/4 RH) was introduced for the treatment of tuberculosis in Morocco. OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy of the national tuberculosis control programme, a prospective study of primary drug resistance was conducted from April 1992 to July 1994 in Casablanca. DESIGN: A total of 402 strains isolated from 402 patients living in Casablanca with no previous history of tuberculosis was included in the study. RESULTS: The overall rate of primary drug resistance to at least one drug was 23.9%; it was 19.7% to streptomycin, 11.4% to isoniazid, and 8.2% to both streptomycin and isoniazid. The rates of resistance to rifampicin and ethambutol were both less than 1%. The survey was divided into two periods of 14 months each. The rates of primary drug resistance increased from 21.1% to 27.6% during these two periods (Odds Ratio [OR] 1.43; 95% Confidence Interval [CI] 0.88 to 2.32); this increase occurred only for streptomycin (15.9% to 24.7%, OR 1.73; 95% CI 1.02 to 2.93). CONCLUSION: The rate of primary drug resistance of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in Casablanca has risen in recent years to an ominous level. Urgent measures are needed in order to interrupt this trend.
