114 strains of Salmonella were isolated from many samples in the Pediatric Hospital (Hopital d'Enfants Albert Royer) of Dakar between January 1985 and December 1991. The sensibility to antibiotics were tested, and we studied the production of beta-lactamase and the presence of plasmids in the resistant strains. 27 serovars of Salmonella were identified and Salmonella typhi predominates with 45%. Only 28% of the strains were susceptible to all of the antibiotics, and 17% were found multiresistant; 8% of the strains produce beta-lactamase and plasmids were found in 6 multiresistant strains.
