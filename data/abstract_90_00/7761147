Gram-negative bacilli that are resistant to commonly used antibiotics are a growing problem in seriously ill, hospitalized patients. Numerous outbreaks involving these organisms have been reported in intensive care nurseries and among critically ill adults. In endemic situations, the major reservoir for these pathogens is the patient; occasionally, transmission from patient to patient occurs through the hands of caregivers. Although the degree of antibiotic use probably plays some role in the emergence of antibiotic-resistant gram-negative bacilli, this relationship has not been uniformly demonstrated, and other factors intrinsic to the organisms themselves and to the critically ill patient may play an important role.
