Bullous Impetigo caused mainly by S. aureus is seen in high incidence in children. Three decades ago CEMs were much more effective for bullous impetigo than today. Recently, the causative S. aureus obtained resistance against not only PCs but multiple antibacterial drugs except a few agents. Therefore the therapy for the disease has become difficult, especially the first choice effective antibacterial drugs for general use. Sensitivity of antibacterial drugs against S. auresu isolated from skin lesions, including some MRSA was studied in 113 patients with bullous impetigo. The agents with high sensitivity against all strains were VCM (100%), MINO (100%), CLDM (96.5%), FMOX (96.3%) and against 39 MRSA strains were VCM (100%), MINO (100%), OFLX (92.3%), CLDM (87.2%) and FOM (82.1%). Clinically available antibacterial drugs for children are MINO granules and FOM drysyrup. Phage group and coagulase type of the S. aureus were simultaneously examined to elucidate which strains were causative or secondary infectious agents of the bullous impetigo.
