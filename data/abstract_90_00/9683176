The tumour promoting properties of carcinogenic 2-acetylaminofluorene (AAF) in rat liver are essentially unknown. We proposed that mitochondria are a target for the cytotoxic effects of 2-nitrosofluorene (NOF), a metabolite of AAF, since NOF induces a redox-cycle at complex I and complex III of the respiratory chain, and impairs respiration and oxidative phosphorylation. We now demonstrate that NOF is a potent inducer of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP) in isolated mitochondria. In the presence of Ca2+, NOF induced rapid swelling of mitochondria in a dose-dependent manner and depolarized the mitochondrial membrane. Permeability transition as well as depolarization were abolished completely by pre-incubation with the PTP inhibitor cyclosporin A. To study whether the PTP is involved in in vivo toxicity, rats were fed a diet containing AAF (0.04%) for 2 weeks. After isolation of mitochondria, permeability transition was induced by high Ca2+ concentrations (150-400 microM) or phosphate plus Ca2+. Swelling was determined as maximal rate of absorption decrease at 540 nm (delta A/delta t). Surprisingly, delta A/delta t-values of mitochondria from AAF-fed rats were significantly lower (16.3 +/- 4.8 x 10(3)/min) than of mitochondria from control animals (32.7 +/- 4.1 x 10(3)/min; P < 0.02). In the presence of phosphate (15 mM), delta A/delta t-values of mitochondria from AAF-fed rats were even lower (10% of control). Moreover, the membrane potential which was dissipated rapidly by the PTP-inducer NOF (30 microM) at a Ca2+ concentration of 80 microM in mitochondria from control animals, remained constant in mitochondria of AAF-treated rats. We therefore propose that the regulation of the PTP is altered on chronic AAF-feeding. The increased resistance of mitochondria against permeability transition may alter the threshold for apoptosis and thus suppress apoptosis. We also discuss the role of epigenetic modifications in early stages of carcinogenesis.
