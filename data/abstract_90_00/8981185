The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and minimum fungicidal concentrations (MFCs) of amphotericin B, flucytosine, miconazole, fluconazole and itraconazole against 21 isolates of Trichosporon beigelii in RPMI-1640 medium were determined using National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) methodology in microdilution method. Most isolates were sensitive to miconazole (MIC90 0.78 microgram/ml), fluconazole (MIC90 6.25 micrograms/ml), and itraconazole (MIC90 0.19 microgram/ml), with the former being the most active agent tested (MFC90 3.12 mu/ml). Although amphotericin B inhibited most strains (MIC range, 0.78-3.12 micrograms/ml), poor fungicidal activity was observed (MFC range, 1.56-12.5 micrograms/ml) showing a pattern of relative resistance in vitro. Flucytosine showed generally poor activity against most isolates tested. These in vitro findings confirm the resistance of T.beigelii to amphotericin B and suggest that azoles may be an alternative to the former for the treatment of disseminated trichosporonosis. However, in vivo studies would better validate these in vitro findings.
