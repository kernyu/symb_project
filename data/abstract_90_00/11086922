A highly potent anti-MRSA sesquiterpenoid has been isolated from Ulmus davidiana var. japonica, which has been traditionally used to treat infectious diseases in Korea. This naturally occurring antibiotic was identified as mansonone F (1). This compound has been found to be highly active specifically against MRSA and showed an MIC range of 0.39-3.13 microg/ml which is comparable to that of vancomycin.
