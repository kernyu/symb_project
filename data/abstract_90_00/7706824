The molecular mechanisms of resistance to streptomycin, rifampin, and isoniazid in 53 Mycobacterium tuberculosis clinical isolates were examined. Twenty-five of 44 streptomycin-resistant strains had mutations in the rpsL gene and 5 of these had rrs gene perturbations. The region of the rpoB gene that is associated with resistance to rifampin was altered in 28 of 29 rifampin-resistant strains. Mutations in known genetic markers of isoniazid resistance were detected in 25 of 42 isoniazid-resistant isolates: 20 strains had katG gene alterations and 5 had perturbations in the inhA operon. Of the 20 multiply resistant strains with reduced sensitivity to streptomycin, rifampin, and isoniazid, 11 had mutations in genetic markers associated with resistance to each of these three drugs. These studies suggest that the primary mechanism of multiple drug resistance in tuberculosis is the accumulation of mutations in individual drug target genes.
