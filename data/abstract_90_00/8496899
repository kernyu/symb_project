The efficacy of moxidectin at 0.2 mg kg-1 live body mass against the multiple anthelmintic resistant White River Krtz strain of H. contortus was determined and compared to that of ivermectin, a benzimidazole, a salicylanilide and levamisole. Moxidectin and levamisole were effective against this strain of H. contortus and reduced the arithmetic mean burdens of this parasite in the sheep by 99.98% and 99.59%, respectively, while the efficacy of ivermectin, albendazole and closantel was only 29.1%, 33.75% and 78.3%, respectively.
