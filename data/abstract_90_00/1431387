A total of 282 strains of Staphylococcus were isolated from University Hospital ward environment from April 1991 to January 1992 and drug-susceptibility tests were performed. The main isolates were 84 strains of S. epidermidis (30%), 65 strains of S. aureus (23%), and 58 strains of S. haemolyticus (21%). One hundred and thirty-six strains of all staphylococci (48%) and 13 of 65 strains of S. aureus (20%) were methicillin (DMPPC)-resistant. The DMPPC-resistant strains of S. aureus were multiple drug-resistant to three to seven antibiotics; ampicillin. cephaloridine, cephametazole, tetracycline, erythromycin, gentamicin, and methicillin, while the DMPPC-susceptible strains were resistant to less than two drugs. These results indicate that this routine testing, along with testing of the anterior nares of the medical staff, is necessary to prevent nosocomial transmission.
