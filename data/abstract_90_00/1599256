We report methods to generate protoplasts, to regenerate mycelia, and to transform Micromonospora echinospora. This actinomycete produces the unusual antitumor antibiotics, the calicheamicins. These protocols may be applied to other actinomycetes that have been difficult to transform. These methods also may facilitate the cloning of calicheamicin biosynthetic genes by genetic complementation.
