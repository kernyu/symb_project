Gas-liquid chromatographic (GLC) fatty acid profile correlation analysis was applied for the subgrouping of 169 coagulase-negative staphylococci collected during an outbreak of nosocomial sepsis in a hematologic unit. The fatty acid profile similarity index between six ciprofloxacin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis septicemia strains was as high as 98.39 +/- 0.68, indicating a high degree of resemblance. This finding corroborated the finding by conventional typing methods that the isolates shared the same strain characteristics and, therefore, could be derived from the same epidemiological origin. Further, the GLC fatty acid profiles were analyzed for coagulase-negative staphylococcal cutaneous isolates recovered from colonization cultures of the patients and personnel in that same unit. The similarity index between 88 ciprofloxacin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis skin isolates with similar plasmid profiles was as high as 95.47 +/- 3.78, whereas the correlation coefficient between 45 ciprofloxacin-susceptible Staphylococcus epidermidis skin isolates with different plasmid profiles was only 85.23 +/- 10.82. Cluster analysis grouped the ciprofloxacin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis isolates into one distinct cluster, while most of the ciprofloxacin-susceptible Staphylococcus epidermidis isolates were grouped into two separate clusters. When compared with the plasmid profiling, the GLC method congruously grouped 127 (87%) of the 146 Staphylococcus epidermidis isolates, thereby suggesting its potential value in subgrouping coagulase-negative staphylococci during nosocomial outbreaks.
