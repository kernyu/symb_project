We previously reported that tea catechin shows bactericidal activity against various bacteria including methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and that bactericidal catechin damages the lipid bilayer of bacterial cell membranes. Here we describe that oxacillin (MPIPC) shows antibacterial activity against MRSA in the presence of catechin below MIC. Twenty clinical isolates of MRSA were examined by a cup method. In the absence of catechin, MPIPC even at a concentration of 40 micrograms/ml did not show antibacterial activity against all isolates of MRSA. However, when catechin below MIC (25-100 micrograms/ml) was mixed with the agar medium, MPIPC (5-12.5 micrograms/ml) showed antibacterial activity against all MRSA isolates. By counting the numbers of viable bacteria in a broth culture, only MPIPC (5 micrograms/ml) or catechin (100 micrograms/ml) showed similar growth curves to the control. But addition of both MPIPC and catechin reduced the number of viable bacteria to 1/100-1/10000 after 24 hours of cultures. Besides MPIPC, in the presence of catechin below MIC methicillin (12.5 micrograms/ml), aminobenzylpenicillin (32 micrograms/ml), tetracycline (2.5 micrograms/ml), and chloramphenicol (12.5 micrograms/ml) showed antibacterial activities against multiple drug resistant MRSA to antibiotics mentioned above. These findings suggest a possible use of catechin in the treatment of MRSA infection.
