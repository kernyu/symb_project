During a ten month period (march-december 1989), all streptococcal strains isolated from clinical specimens sent to our laboratory were routinely tested for high-level resistance to aminoglycosides. High-level resistance was detected in 16 out of 475 streptococci: streptomycin (two strains), kanamycin (four strains), streptomycin and kanamycin (ten strains).
