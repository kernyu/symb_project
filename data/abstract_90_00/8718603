To delineate the mechanisms contributing to the high level of antimicrobial resistance often demonstrated by Xanthomonas maltophilia, plasmid DNA was isolated from 5 clinical isolates and analyzed. Purified plasmid DNA from a single isolate contained a 6.5 kb plasmid (pXM222) and a 5.6 kb plasmid, (pTHB). Transformation of pTHB into E. coli HB101 resulted in the expression of resistance to all penicillins tested and cefazolin.
