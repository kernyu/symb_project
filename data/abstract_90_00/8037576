Possible L-transformation of Shigella under the action of biseptol on an artificial nutrient medium was investigated. The L-forms were isolated from 6 out of 35 cultures. By the morphological properties the isolates were similar to the L-forms of Shigella flexneri induced by furazolidone. The growth of the L-forms proceeded by the pattern of the rapid mass L-conversion of bacteria and was accompanied by the development of resistance to biseptol. It was inhibited by folic acid added to the medium.
