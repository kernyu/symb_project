Acute otitis media (AOM) is an infection frequently found in children, but tends to be less frequent with age and its frequency in adults is only about 1%. The etiology of AOM in children is prevalently bacterial; numerous studies have shown the most common etiological agents. But the etiology in adults has not been well studied. The authors examined 40 cases of AOM in adults, the pathologic material was obtained by needle aspiration; in 32 samples there was bacterial growth. In the majority of the cases (94%) the bacteria isolated were the same as those found in children: S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae and B. catarrhalis; much rarer were S. pyogenes and S. aureus. On the potential beta-lactamase producing strains, this activity was measured. From our findings we believe that there is the necessity to have a rational antibiotic therapy (due to the difficulty in obtaining pathologic material) with active drugs for the probable etiological agents of AOM.
