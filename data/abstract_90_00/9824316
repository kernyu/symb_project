Two tobacco genes (TOGT) with homology to glucosyltransferase genes known to be induced by salicylic acid (SA) also responded rapidly to a fungal elicitor or to an avirulent pathogen. SA, although an efficient inducer, was shown not to be essential in the signal transduction pathway regulating TOGT gene expression during the resistance response. Recombinant TOGT proteins produced in Escherichia coli exhibited low, but significant, glucosyltransferase activity towards SA, but very high activity towards hydroxycoumarins and hydroxycinnamic acids, with glucose esters being the predominant products. These results point to a possible important function in defense of these glucosyltransferases in conjugating aromatic metabolites prior to their transport and cross-linking to the cell wall.
