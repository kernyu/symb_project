UNLABELLED: Nosocomial infections are a serious problem in treatment because they are caused by bacteria that have developed increased antibiotic resistance. DESIGN: to estimate the efficiency of ceftazidime in nosocomial treatment among children. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We treated 20 children aged 1-20 months, mainly in their first three months of life. They were hospitalized because of some other illness or diagnosis. During hospitalization they contracted a nosocomial infection: 16 urinary tract infections (mainly E. coli), 4 others pneumonia. Ceftazidime was the choice for empirical antibiotic therapy, before we obtained the patients' microbiological results. RESULT: We did not observe progress of pathologies which had been present when the nosocomial infection had begun, either during or after therapy. CONCLUSION: Ceftazidime is an efficient and safe antibiotic in treatment of nosocomial infection in young children.
