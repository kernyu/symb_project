Phagosomes contain class II MHC (MHC-II) and form peptide:MHC-II complexes, but the source of phagosomal MHC-II molecules is uncertain. Phagosomes may acquire nascent MHC-II or preexisting, recycling MHC-II that may be internalized from the plasma membrane. Brefeldin A (BFA) was used to deplete nascent MHC-II in murine macrophages to determine the relative contributions of nascent and recycling MHC-II molecules to phagocytic Ag processing. In addition, biotinylation of cell-surface proteins was used to assess the transport of MHC-II from the cell surface to phagosomes. BFA inhibited macrophage processing of latex bead-conjugated Ag for presentation to T cells, suggesting that nascent MHC-II molecules are important in phagocytic Ag processing. Furthermore, detection of specific peptide:MHC-II complexes in isolated phagosomes confirmed that BFA decreased formation of peptide:MHC-II complexes within phagosomes. Both flow organellometry and Western blot analysis of purified phagosomes showed that about two-thirds of phagosomal MHC-II was nascent (depleted by 3 h prior treatment with BFA) and primarily derived from intracellular sites. About one-third of phagosomal MHC-II was preexisting and primarily derived from the plasma membrane. BFA had little effect on phagosomal H2-DM or the degradation of bead-associated Ag. Thus, inhibition of phagocytic Ag processing by BFA correlated with depletion of nascent MHC-II in phagosomes and occurred despite the persistent delivery of plasma membrane-derived recycling MHC-II molecules and other Ag-processing components to phagosomes. These observations suggest that phagosomal Ag processing depends primarily on nascent MHC-II molecules delivered from intracellular sites, e.g., endocytic compartments.
