Antimalarial activities of tetracycline (TC) and erythromycin (EM), alone or in combination with artemisinin (Qinghaosu, QHS), were studied using chloroquine (CQ)-sensitive (D6) and -resistant (W2) strains of Plasmodium falciparum in vitro. The antimalarial potency of TC (IC50 = 9862 nM for the CQ-sensitive parasite, 32414 nM for the CQ-resistant one) or EM (IC50 = 45787 nM for the CQ-sensitive parasite, 33397 nM for the CQ-resistant one) was much less than that of QHS (IC50 ranging from 25 to 40 nM). The CQ-resistant falciparum parasite displayed a cross-resistance to TC, while both the drug-sensitive and -resistant parasites exhibited similar responses to EM. However, antimalarial potency of EM appeared to be less than that of TC against the drug-sensitive parasite. When TC was combined with QHS, an additive interaction was observed against the CQ-sensitive falciparum parasite, while synergism was found with the CQ-resistant parasite. When EM was tested in combination with QHS, a potentiating interaction occurred with both the CQ-sensitive and resistant falciparum parasite. The above results indicated that the QHS combination with either TC or EM may be a promising antimalarial preparation with low recrudescence compared to artemisinin used alone in clinical practice.
