Drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) has emerged as a worldwide problem. The annual incidence of TB has increased in Israel in the last decade, mainly due to successive waves of immigration. Few data are available on drug-resistant TB in Israel A 10-year retrospective review was conducted on all patients who had been infected with culture-proven Mycobacterium tuberculosis and had been admitted to our hospital. Forty-seven patients had culture-positive TB; 27 (57%) were male, 20 (43%) were female; mean age (+/- SD) was 56 +/- 23 years. Twenty patients (43%) had pulmonary TB. Three patients (6.4%) had single-drug resistance; 4 patients (8.5%) had multi-drug resistance. Six of the seven patients (86%) with drug-resistant TB had been diagnosed after 1990. Six of the 20 patients (30%) with pulmonary TB had drug-resistant organisms. Six of the 7 patients (86%) with drug-resistant TB had pulmonary infection, as compared to 15/40 (37%) of the patients with drug-susceptible TB (p < 0.001). Six of the 7 patients (86%) with drug-resistant TB had a history of TB. Fifteen percent (14.9%) of all new cases diagnosed with TB in our hospital in the last 10 years had drug-resistant M. tuberculosis. Thirty percent of patients with pulmonary TB had drug-resistant organisms. Drug-resistant TB has evidently emerged in Israel and poses a serious clinical and social threat. A strong case for directly-observed treatment in Israel should be made, especially since the incidence of TB here is still small.
