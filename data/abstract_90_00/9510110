We prospectively surveyed for rectal colonization with vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus among 93 high-risk pediatric patients who were hospitalized at least 5 (median, 20) days. Fifty-two patients (56%) had enterococcal colonization; none had active infection with Enterococcus. All enterococci were vancomycin-susceptible (minimum inhibitory concentration < or =4 microg/mL). Associated exposures included recent antibiotics (50, 96%), surgical procedures (26, 58%), and immunosuppression (15, 29%).
