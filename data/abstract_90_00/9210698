The in vitro activity of a new pneumocandin, L-743,872, was evaluated with 108 strains of Candida and compared with the activities of various antifungals. L-743,872 demonstrated the best activity against azole-susceptible and -resistant strains of C. albicans, C. glabrata, C. tropicalis, C. parapsilosis, and C. kefyr and less activity against C. krusei, C. lusitaniae, and C. guilliermondii.
