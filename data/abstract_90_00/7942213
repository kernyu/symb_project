Report of a retrospective study to evaluate susceptibility of Escherichia coli to quinolones covering the March-December 1992 interval. During this time, intra and extra-hospital strains were indistinctly studied in patients with urinary infections seen in a health district serving a total of 200.000 inhabitants. Resistance to Pipemidic acid, Norfloxacin and Ciprofloxacin was evaluated. The values found were 14.8% resistance to Pipemidic acid, 11.1% to Norfloxacin and 8.5% to Ciprofloxacin. It seems necessary to develop and apply methods addressed to minimize the appearance of quinolone resistance, which should be implemented in order to preserve the usefulness of these drugs.
