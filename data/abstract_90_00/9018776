BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Failure of gonococcal infections to respond to 500 mg of ciprofloxacin or 400 mg of ofloxacin has been reported from Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Recently, high rates of decreased susceptibility to the fluoroquinolones have been detected in penicillinase-producing Neisseria gonorrhoeae in the Republic of the Philippines. GOALS: To assess the diversity of antimicrobial-resistant gonococcal strains isolated from female sex workers in Manila and Cebu City in the Republic of the Philippines in 1994. STUDY DESIGN: Isolates of N. gonorrhoeae isolated from 92 female sex workers in Manila (n = 28) and Cebu City (n = 64), respectively, were characterized by plasmid profile, auxotype/serovar class, and antimicrobial susceptibility profile. RESULTS: Plasmid-mediated resistance to penicillin or tetracycline was identified in 79.3% (73/92) of the isolates: penicillinase-producing N. gonorrhoeae (65/92; 70.7%), tetracycline-resistant N. gonorrhoeae (6/92; 6.5%), and penicillinase-producing/tetracycline-resistant N. gonorrhoeae (1/92; 1.1%). A beta-lactamase plasmid of 3.9 megadaltons was discovered. Of 54.3% (50/92) of strains resistant to nalidixic acid, 84% (42/50) of strains had minimum inhibitory concentrations of > or = 0.125 microgram/ml ciprofloxacin; penicillinase-producing N. gonorrhoeae (possessing the 3.05-, 3.2-, 3.9-, and 4.4-megadalton beta-lactamase plasmids, respectively) accounted for 68% (34/50) of these strains. CONCLUSIONS: In the Republic of the Philippines, gonococcal isolates resistant to penicillin or tetracycline accounted for 85.9% (79/92) of the isolates examined and included strains exhibiting resistance to fluoroquinolones. All gonococcal infections should be treated with antimicrobial therapies known to be active against all gonococcal strains to reduce the spread of strains exhibiting decreased susceptibilities to fluoroquinolones.
