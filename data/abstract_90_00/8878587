The activities of novel iron chelators, alone and in combination with chloroquine, quinine, or artemether, were evaluated in vitro against susceptible and resistant clones of Plasmodium falciparum with a semimicroassay system. N4-nonyl,N1,N8-bis(2,3-dihydroxybenzoyl) spermidine hydrobromide (compound 7) demonstrated the highest level of activity: 170 nM against a chloroquine-susceptible clone and 1 microM against a chloroquine-resistant clone (50% inhibitory concentrations). Compounds 6, 8, and 10 showed antimalarial activity with 50% inhibitory concentrations of about 1 microM. Compound 7 had no effect on the activities of chloroquine, quinine, and artemether against either clone, and compound 8 did not enhance the schizontocidal action of either chloroquine or quinine against the chloroquine-resistant clone. The incubation of compound 7 with FeCI3 suppressed or decreased the in vitro antimalarial activity of compound 7, while no effect was observed with incubation of compound 7 with CuSO4 and ZnSO4. These results suggest that iron deprivation may be the main mechanism of action of compound 7 against the malarial parasites. Chelator compounds 7 and 8 primarily affected trophozoite stages, probably by influencing the activity of ribonucleotide reductase, and thus inhibiting DNA synthesis.
