A study was made of the effect of ionizing radiation on mitotic cycle and survival of the Chinese hamster cells of two clones-CHLV-79 RJK, and its derivative Vebr-30, resistant to ethidium bromide. Ethidium bromide resistant cells were more resistant to 1) lethal effects of gamma rays (by cell survival); 2) X-rays (by cell cycle recovery after irradiation of cells in a dose of 5 Gr); 3) colcemide treatment (by accumulation of cells in G2+M phase). These data may result from damaging a certain regulatory process, which may be involved in cell response to radiation damage and in repair of predominantly sublethal and partly lethal DNA lesions as well as of cell membrane structures.
