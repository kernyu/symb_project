Laboratory and clinical studies on panipenem/betamipron (PAPM/BP), a new carbapenem antibiotic, were carried out in the field of pediatrics and the following results were obtained. 1. The antibacterial activities of panipenam (PAPM) against clinically isolated organisms in our department were high overall. 2. After 30 minutes intravenous infusion of PAPM/BP at a dose of 10 mg/10 mg/kg in 1 and of 20 mg/20 mg/kg in 2 children, peak plasma levels of PAPM ranged from 33.21 to 75.66 micrograms/ml at the end of the infusion. The half-lives were 0.81 to 0.93 hours. The cumulative urinary recovery rates in the first 6 hours after the start of drip infusion ranged from 10.7 to 40.4%. 3. PAPM/BP was administered to 16 pediatric patients with various infections. The clinical and bacteriological efficacy rates were both 100%. 4. No side effects were observed. Abnormal laboratory test results were also mild; slight elevation of GOT, GOT/GPT and eosinophylia in 1 each and thrombocytosis in 2.
