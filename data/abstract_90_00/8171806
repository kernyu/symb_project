As a result of a recent European Union meeting on anthelmintic resistant nematodes of farm animals, a list was made of nine proposals for research and five to control anthelmintic resistance. The most important were the need to have standardised and new tests to monitor the development and spread of resistant nematodes in sheep, goats, horses, cattle and pigs, and for education of veterinary surgeons and farmers in the optimal control strategies to be used to delay the development of anthelmintic resistance in nematodes.
