A pyrimethamine-resistant line of Plasmodium berghei was derived by treating infected mice with high doses of pyrimethamine and selecting for recrudescence. This resistant line was compared with the parental pyrimethamine-sensitive line in order to ascertain whether drug resistance is associated with a biological advantage. Overall, the pyrimethamine-resistant line is quite similar to the sensitive line, except that it proceeds through sporogonic development more slowly than the pyrimethamine-sensitive parental line. However, under pyrimethamine pressure the sensitive line is unable to undergo the sporogonic cycle, whereas the resistant line is unaffected. These results indicate that the transmission of pyrimethamine resistance in this model is favored only under conditions of drug pressure.
