Determination of the MDR-phenotype in patients suffering from AML is an important hallmark of treatment outcome but is often complicated by technical problems in P-gp assessment. A PCR-MIMIC strategy was employed to construct PCR-fragments for a competitive and quantitative mdr1 reverse transcription-PCR-assay. Using K562 cells, which had been selected for drug resistance to the epipodophyllotoxin VP16, a stepwise increase of mdr1 levels depending on the concentration of VP16 was shown with the MIMIC technique. Comparison of mdr1 levels in drug selected K562 cells with the corresponding levels for P-gp and functional data indicated a mRNA threshold that has to be exceeded for the full expression of the MDR-phenotype. Subsequently mdr1 levels of 34 samples of de novo acute myeloid leukemia were determined with the PCR-MIMIC strategy. Ten patient samples could be identified with elevated mdr1 levels which were substantially lower than the levels observed in the MDR-cell line K 562 0.7 microM VP16. Outcome analysis revealed that eight of the ten patients had an unfavourable prognosis and did not achieve CR after induction chemotherapy. Coexpression of mdr1 and CD 34 was not associated with CR in all examined cases. Moreover all these patients had unfavourable cytogenetic aberrations. These data indicate a sensitive technique with applicability in patient material.
