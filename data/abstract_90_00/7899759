In France, the treatment of tuberculosis must take into account both the low rate of multiresistance and the relatively low cost of drugs (the cost of 6 months treatment is about equivalent to the cost of 1 day of hospitalization). A six-month regimen has been recommended in France since 1981. Streptomycin is no longer used routinely. A combination of rifampicin, isoniazid and pyrazinamide is the basis of initial treatment either in as a single medication (Rifater) or taken separately. Ethambutol is added at treatment onset, especially when there was a doubt about resistance. The second phase uses isoniazid and rifampicin, together (Rifanah) or separate.
