The kinetics of both intracellular and extracellular beta-lactamase production and the relationship between extracellular enzyme and in vitro susceptibility of Mycobacterium fortuitum to beta-lactam antibiotics have been studied. To this end we used a panel of stable nitrosoguanidine-induced mutants of M. fortuitum derived from the parental strain ATCC 19542 and differing in beta-lactamase production from 0.0001 to 278 U/liter in Mueller-Hinton broth. For overproducers of beta-lactamase (mutants A188, B180, C207, D316, and E31), MICs of benzylpenicillin, amoxicillin, ampicillin, and cephaloridine progressively increased with the amount of enzyme released into the medium, whereas MICs of imipenem and cefoxitin did not. The resistance of the mutants to amoxicillin was reduced up to 32-fold by clavulanic acid, whereas that to ampicillin was reduced 8-fold by sulbactam. These data suggest that the enzyme participated in the mechanisms of resistance to the beta-lactam antibiotics. However, for a mutant of M. fortuitum (gamma 27) with virtually nonexistent beta-lactamase production, the antibiotics still had relatively high MICs (for instance, benzylpenicillin and cephaloridine had MICs of 64 and 32 micrograms/ml, respectively). This suggests that, aside from beta-lactamase production, other mechanisms such as cell wall permeability and/or affinity for penicillin-binding proteins could coexist in M. fortuitum and explain its natural resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics.
