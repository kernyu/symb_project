From June to October 1995, the U.S. Army's 86th Combat Support Hospital was deployed in Haiti in support of the United Nations peacekeeping mission. The hospital's mission was to provide comprehensive health care to United Nations military and civilian personnel in Haiti. The hospital's laboratory, with microbiological and parasitological capability, was a critical asset in light of the infectious disease threats in Haiti. A total of 356 microbiological (5.4%) and 887 parasitological (13.4%) tests were performed, out of a total of 6628 laboratory tests. One finding was the discovery of antibiotic-resistant urinary isolates of Escherichia coli. These were from community-acquired infections and included strains resistant to ampicillin (6/15), trimethoprim+sulfamethoxazole (6/15), and ciprofloxacin (2/15). Ampicillin (8/15) and trimethoprim+sulfamethoxazole (3/15) resistance was also noted in Shigella spp. However, no chloroquine-resistant strains of malaria were encountered. Dengue virus, also mosquito borne, was a major pathogen. Antimicrobial-resistant nosocomial pathogens were also encountered. Deployed laboratories should be able to determine antimicrobial susceptibility and perform microbial identification to guide clinical management, conduct medical surveillance, and detect emerging resistance.
