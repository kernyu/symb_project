MarR negatively regulates expression of the multiple antibiotic resistance operon (marRAB) in Escherichia coli. In this study, it was demonstrated that sodium salicylate, plumbagin, 2, 4-dinitrophenol, and menadione-inducers of the marRAB operon in whole cells-all interfered with the repressor activity of MarR in vitro. It is proposed that these compounds can interact directly with MarR to affect its repressor activity.
