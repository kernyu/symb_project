Two chemically mutagenized agerminative variants of Candida albicans were used to immunize mice against challenge with highly virulent cells of the parent strain. Although both mutants (Vir- 3 and Vir- 13) resulted in nonlethal infection and could be recovered from mouse organs for many days after the intravenous inoculation of 10(7) to 10(6) cells, significant protection to systemic challenge with virulent C. albicans was induced by only one (Vir- 3) of the two variants. Anticandidal resistance in Vir- 3-infected mice was associated with the occurrence in vivo of strong delayed-type hypersensitivity to Candida antigen, detection in vitro of highly fungicidal effector macrophages, and presence in the serum of a large proportion of Candida-reactive antibodies of the immunoglobulin G2a isotype. Bulk cultures of purified CD4+ lymphocytes from mice infected with either mutant were compared for their ability to produce gamma interferon (IFN-gamma), interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-4, and IL-6 in vitro. After stimulation with specific antigen, CD4+ cells from Vir- 3-immunized mice released large amounts of the Th1-specific cytokines, IFN-gamma and IL-2, at a time when CD4+ cells from Vir- 13-infected mice predominantly secreted the characteristic Th2 cytokines, IL-4 and IL-6. These results were confirmed by quantitative analysis of cytokine-producing Th1 and Th2 cells. In addition, only mice infected with Vir- 3 displayed a high frequency of CD8+ cells with the potential for in vitro lysis of yeast-primed bone marrow macrophages. Purified CD4+ cells from Vir- 3-infected mice, but not a mixture of these cells with CD4+ lymphocytes from mice infected with Vir- 13, could adoptively transfer delayed-type hypersensitivity reactivity onto naive mice. Taken together, these data suggest that both Th1 and Th2 CD4+ lymphocytes may be activated during experimental C. albicans infection in mice.
