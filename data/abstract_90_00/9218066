Although there have been dramatic strides in the therapy of human immunodeficiency virus infection over the last few years, the number of infected people world-wide is tremendous and, at least in developing countries, continues to expand. Complications which involve the gastrointestinal tract are common in these patients, because the gut is a major site for involvement by opportunistic infections and neoplasms in patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. It is important to recognize the clinical spectrum of gastrointestinal diseases, as well as the appropriate and most cost-effective diagnostic strategies, as therapies for a number of these disorders are both widely available and high effective. This review summarizes the major gastrointestinal infections which are seen in patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, and their treatment.
