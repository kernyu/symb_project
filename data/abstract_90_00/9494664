As part of the multi-pronged strategy in the fight against burn infection, we conducted a retrospective study of the pattern of infection in our burn patients for a period of 15 months from January 1993 to March 1994. We studied culture and sensitivity reports to determine the incidence of each organism, their antibiotic sensitivity patterns and the time interval between the burns injury and the appearance of these organisms. Organisms like methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and multiply-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii constituted a problem in our patients. Other organisms that were isolated from our patients included Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter species and Klebsiella species. The infection control measures in our burns centre are aimed at combating the spread of gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. This study has helped to influence our antibiotic administration policy for treating infection in our centre based on the sensitivity patterns of the prevailing flora.
