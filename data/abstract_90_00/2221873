Nucleotide sequences related to four tet genes were studied by hybridization in 183 clinical Staphylococcus isolates. tet(K) predominated in strains resistant only to tetracycline, while tet(M) was responsible for combined tetracycline and minocycline resistance. In strains harboring both genes, they contributed additively. tet(L) was detected in only five strains, and no hybridization was observed with tet(O).
