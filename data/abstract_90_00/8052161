Rampant dental caries was induced in hyposalivated rats fed a high sucrose diet without infection of mutans streptococci, in which increased numbers of lactobacilli and S. aureus were demonstrated in the oral flora. Administration of either penicillin or piperacillin, effective against all isolates of lactobacilli, markedly inhibited the caries induction in these rats, while severe dental caries was induced in hyposalivated rats given vancomycin that is inhibitory against S. aureus. These results suggested that certain lactobacilli might induce dental caries in hyposalivated rats fed a sucrose diet. Three strains of Lactobacillus species isolated from the hyposalivated rats were made resistant to erythromycin. The caries-inducing activity of these erythromycin-resistant lactobacilli was studied in hyposalivated rats giving erythromycin in the drinking water at a concentration of 500 micrograms/ml. After a 61-day experimental period, severe dental caries was induced in hyposalivated rats infected with L. fermentum TY1R. On the other hand, low caries incidence was found in hyposalivated rats infected with either L. acidophilus TY7R or L. plantarum TY3R. These results indicate that L. fermentum may be one of causative agents of dental caries in hyposalivated rats fed a sucrose diet.
