Knowledge of local antimicrobial resistance patterns of bacteria is a valuable guide to empirical antimicrobial therapy. This paper reports the resistance patterns of more than 36,000 bacteria isolated between August 1991 and July 1992 in six Malaysian hospitals and discusses the implications of the results. A customized menu driven software programme was developed to analyse the results. Generally, resistance to the commonly used antibiotics like ampicillin, cloxacillin, cephalosporins, gentamicin, cotrimoxazole and tetracycline was high. Some differences in resistance rate amongst the six hospitals were also noted. Continuous surveillance of antimicrobial resistance in hospitals is encouraged for the effective control of the emergence of antimicrobial resistance.
