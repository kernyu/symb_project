Cold-provoked intensification of oxygen consumption was correlated with individual radioresistance of mice. There was a positive correlation between the parameters in normoxia and hyperoxia, and a distinct negative correlation in hypoxia. Radiosensitizer of hypoxic cells, metronidasol, severed the correlation no matter what level of oxygenation in the course of irradiation. The hypothesis for intracellular pO2 as a mediator of the dependence of individual radioresistance on the gas exchange reactivity has been put forward.
