A polymyxin B (PXB)-resistant mutant of Klebsiella pneumoniae O3 was isolated. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) extracted from the PXB-resistant isolate bound little PXB, although LPS from the parental strain did. The 31P nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrum of PXB-resistant type LPS showed that it contained much less of the phosphomonoesters and the pyrophosphate esters, and an increased amount of the phosphodiesters, compared to the parental type LPS. The decrease in the binding of PXB might be due to altered phosphate groups on the PXB-resistant type LPS, suggesting that it might explain the PXB-resistance of the mutant.
