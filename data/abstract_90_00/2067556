An electroporation protocol for the successful transfection of mouse lymphoblastoid cells has been developed. Two cell lines, a normal and a mutant sensitive to DNA cross-linking agents, were used. The optimum conditions of electroporation in terms of uptake of the fluorescent dye lucifer yellow coupled with low toxicity were established. Subsequently, these conditions were used to achieve stable transfection by a plasmid expression vector. The plasmid integration patterns were determined by Southern blot analysis.
