All the papers presented at the conference are reviewed and comparisons are made with past beliefs on the topic. Early childhood caries (ECC) is a serious public health problem in disadvantaged communities in both developing and industrialized countries in which under-nutrition is common. ECC involves the maxillary primary incisors within months after their eruption and spreads rapidly to involve other primary teeth. The early implantation of mutans streptococci, the use of a feeding bottle containing sugary solutions and prolonged breast-feeding, especially at night, are important predisposing factors. Attention is drawn to the need for more research into the factors which determine the resistance of the enamel and particularly the elucidation of the relationship established in several countries between early enamel caries, enamel hypoplasia, and perinatal under- or malnutrition. Primary preventive measures should be applied during the ante- and immediate post-natal periods. Secondary preventive measures include the use of chemotherapeutic agents such as fluoride, and antimicrobials. The most appropriate tertiary preventive measure is the atraumatic restorative technique (ART). Broadly based committees should be established by governments to address the issues of caries risk in young children. Parents and all personnel involved in infant health and welfare should be shown how to recognize early signs of the condition, as well as to promote early intervention and referral.
