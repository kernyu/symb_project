The anthelmintic efficacy of benzimidazoles, levamisole, closantel, ivermectin and moxidectin was evaluated on an institutional farm in Malaysia using faecal egg count reduction tests, controlled slaughter trials and an in vitro egg hatch assay. The results of this study indicated simultaneous resistance of Haemonchus contortus against benzimidazoles and ivermectin and of Trichostrongylus colubriformis against benzimidazoles and levaminsole on the same farm. Moxidectin was effective against the ivermectin resistant H. contortus.
