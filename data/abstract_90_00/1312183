Disk diffusion zone diameter breakpoint criteria for Tosufloxacin and Lomefloxacin were tentatively established by correlating MICs with 1-, 5- and 10 micrograms of Tosufloxacin disk inhibitory zone diameters and with 10 micrograms of Lomefloxacin disk of those to 418 clinical isolates representing 32 species. We recommend 5 micrograms disks for Tosufloxacin with the following breakpoints: Susceptible (MIC, less than or equal to 0.5 microgram/ml), greater than or equal to 22 mm; intermediate, 17 to 21 mm; and resistant (MIC, greater than or equal to 2.0 micrograms/ml), less than or equal to 16 mm. We recommend 10 micrograms disks for Lomefloxacin with the following breakpoints: Susceptible (MIC, less than or equal to 2.0 micrograms/ml), greater than or equal to 21 mm; intermediate, 16 to 20 mm; and resistant (MIC, greater than or equal to 8.0 micrograms/ml), less than or equal to 15 mm. Using these criteria for Tosufloxacin and Lomefloxacin, the occurrence rate of major errors in judging susceptibility and resistance was 0.48%.
