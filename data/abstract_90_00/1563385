Borderline oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (BORSA) may be misidentified as intrinsically methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in the clinical laboratory. Under disk diffusion testing conditions designed to maximize detection of MRSA (incubation at 32 degrees C, pre-induction with methicillin, or plating on 4% NaCl-supplemented agar), BORSA strains also tend to appear resistant to semisynthetic penicillins. Under these conditions, ampicillin/sulbactam appears to be more accurate than amoxicillin/clavulanic acid for differentiating BORSA from MRSA.
