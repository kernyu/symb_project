In 14 patients from which methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was isolated at the Department of Urology, Tone Chuo Hospital June, 1992 and October, 1993, the site of infection, background of patients, and drug resistance were analyzed. The 14 patients consisted of 11 males and 3 females between 45 and 85 years old with a mean of 71.6 years. The site from which MRSA was isolated was urine in 11, wound in 2, nasal cavity in 1, pharynx in 1, and renal fistula in 1 (detected at 2 or more sites in 2). The underlying condition was prostate hyperplasia in 2, prostate cancer in 4 (after radical prostatectomy in 1, complicated by bladder stone in 1), bladder tumor in 3, (during bladder instillation of BCG in 1), perirenal abscess in 2, renal pelvic tumor in 1, neurogenic bladder in 1, and after Boari's operation in 1. Urethral catheterization had been performed in 3. A fewer of 38 degrees C or above was noted in 3. Mixed infection was observed in 10, and was caused by Escherichia coli in 2, Proteus mirabiris in 1, Candida in 1, Klebsiella in 2, Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 2, and Serratia in 2. Four patients has previously been administered antibiotics, which were third generation cephems in 3 and penicillin in 1. The drug sensitivity was 100% for vancomycin (VCM), 30% for imipenam (IMP), 31% for minomycin (MINO), 31% for amikacin (AMK), and 7% for fosfomycin (FOM). As for chemotherapy, VCM+FOM+sulbactam/cefoperazone were administered to 6, and ceftazidime+ MINO were administered to 1.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
