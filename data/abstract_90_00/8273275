A broth microdilution technique is described for determining the antimicrobial susceptibility of Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae, using commercially prepared Sensititre plates. Twenty-five field isolates and two reference strains (J & 232), were tested against seven antimicrobials. Field isolates were tested in duplicate and reference strains, four times to estimate reproducibility. Ninety-seven percent of the duplicate MIC results for the field isolates were in agreement, or within one log2 dilution. Similar results were obtained with the reference strains. The isolates were susceptible to lincomycin-spectinomycin, tylosin and oxytetracycline or resistant to amoxycillin, apramycin and erythromycin. Susceptibility to furaltadone varied. This method retains the accuracy and reproducibility of broth MIC determinations, while avoiding the lengthy preparation of antimicrobial dilutions normally associated with more traditional methods.
