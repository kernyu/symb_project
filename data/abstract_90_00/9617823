During efforts for cloning disease resistance-responsive genes, a cDNA encoding a putative Nicotiana glutinosa glycine-rich RNA binding protein (ngRBP) was isolated from TMV induced cDNA library. Northern blot hybridization revealed that ngRBP gene is negatively regulated during early hours of TMV induced acute hypersensitive response (HR). Under greenhouse conditions induced expression of ngRBP gene was observed after 24 h following TMV infection. Salicylic acid and copper also induced ngRBP mRNA expression. Our findings are suggestive of some possible role for ngRBP in plant-pathogen interaction.
