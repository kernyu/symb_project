Identification of the main bacteria causing otitis media with effusion (OME) in a given population is essential. It indicates the degree of involvement of a given bacterium in a particular disease of that population. Knowledge of the most prevalent bacteria would initiate the search for the mode of acquisition of such bacteria and may aid in establishing appropriate control and prevention programs, which may decrease the incidence of OME. The rapid response of most OME to a variety of broad-spectrum antimicrobials deprives the clinician from knowing the particular bacteriologic agent prevailing in a community. With the emergence of resistant strains and the change over time of the relative distribution of bacteriologic agents known to cause OME, the identification of the bacterial etiology of OME in Lebanese children was initiated.
