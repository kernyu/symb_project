OBJECTIVE: Classify antibiotics according to their individual activity so as to identify those suitable for empiric therapy. METHODS: We studied bacterial strains isolated from patients with urethritis (n = 189) and upper genital tract infections (n = 163) between June 1994 and February 1995 in 3 hospital and 4 community laboratories. Upper genital tract infections were divided into two groups: proven infection on laparoscopy specimen (n = 79) and suspected infection with isolation of pathogen in cervical samples (n = 84). Pathogens isolated were: Chlamydia trachomatis in 36/12/15 cases respectively, Mycoplasma hominis in 12/20/13, Ureaplasma urealyticum in 55/30/15, Neisseria gonorrhoeae in 40/2/0, Haemophilus spp in 20/2/1, group B streptococci in 7/1/8, E. coli in 8/1/17 and miscellaneous in 11/8/15. The minimal inhibitory concentrations for all strains were determined in 4 laboratories for ofloxacin, erythromycin and doxycyclin against C. trachomatis, M. hominis and U. urealyticum, and for ofloxacin, erythromycin, doxycyclin, amoxicillin+clavulanate, cefotaxime and gentamicin against the other strains. The activity score (% susceptibility to each antibiotic weighted by the frequencies of each isolate in urethritis and upper genital tract infection based on recent French epidemiologic data) was calculated for each antibiotic. CONCLUSION: The antibiotics with the best empiric activity scores in urethritis were, in decreasing order: doxycyclin (90.4%), ofloxacin (88.1%), and erythromycin (50.2%). The most active combinations in upper genital tract infections were ofloxacin+amoxicillin (100%), doxycyclin+cefotaxime+metronidazole (95.9%) and doxycyclin+amoxicillin (95.3%).
