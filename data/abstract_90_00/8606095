The existence of interleukin-12-mediated innate immune responses to group B streptococci (GBS) was tested by examining T-lymphocyte-independent gamma interferon (IFN) production in cultured splenocytes from severe combined immunodeficiency mice. Splenocytes were cultured with killed or living GBS for 48 h, and then IFN was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Type III GBS as well as other extracellular bacterial agents of neonatal sepsis (staphylococci and enterococci) induced IFN production, which was enhanced by interleukin-2 and was inhibited by neutralizing antibodies to tumor necrosis factor alpha and to mouse interleukin-12. Interleukin-12 bioactivity was present in conditioned medium from GBS-treated adherent macrophages. Adherent peritoneal macrophages and bone marrow-derived natural killer cells from severe combined immunodeficiency mice cultured separately with GBS did not produce IFN, whereas cocultures did produce IFN. Functional macrophage activation was evident by nitric oxide production in GBS-treated splenocyte cultures. The results show that extracellular pathogens such as GBS, similarly to intracellular microbes, induce macrophage interleukin-12 and tumor necrosis factor alpha, which promote natural killer cell secretion of IFN, which then enhances innate phagocyte resistance mechanisms.
