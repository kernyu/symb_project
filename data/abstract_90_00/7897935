Auxotypes, serovars and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of various antibiotics are investigated on 85 gonococcal strains isolated from the patient with gonorrhea from 1984 to 1986 in Japanese Red Cross Medical Center. As to the auxotypes 33 strains were identified to be Proto, 33 to be Pro, 10 to be Arg and 9 to be PAU. No AHU strain was identified. Serovars were divided into 1A and 1B. MIC of 22 kinds of antibiotics including penicillins, cephems, spectinomycin, tetracycline and new quinolones were determined. Cumulative MIC curves were found to be shifted to the right according to the order of auxotypes Arg, PAU, Proto, Pro in the most antibiotics. Serovar 1A was found to have lower MIC as compared to 1B, though only 5 strain of 1A were in the study. Seventy-eight % of isolates were Proto or Pro, so-called Asian auxotype which were revealed to have higher MIC not only of penicillin but also of the other antibiotics. Nine strains were identified as PAU which was lately identified in Canada. This might suggest that gonococcal strains are spreading over the world in spite of the local predominance of auxotype distribution.
