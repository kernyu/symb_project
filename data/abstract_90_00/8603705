Amongst the chromogranin B (CGB) derived fragments naturally generated in bovine chromaffin granules and detected in the extracellular space, we recently identified a major peptide corresponding to the 614-626 sequence of CGB. This peptide, named secretolytin, shared an interesting sequence homology with the lytic domain of cecropins and displayed a potent antibacterial activity. The aim of the present study was to determine the structural features of secretolytin necessary for this biological activity. Our results suggest that an alpha-helical amphipathic structure common to secretolytin, cecropins and pig myeloid antibacterial peptide may account for the antibacterial activity.
