The yeast-mycelium dimorphism of the genus Benjaminiella poitrasii has been investigated. To understand the mechanism of dimorphism two stable yeast-phase mutants (Y-1 & Y-2) and one slow growing mycelial mutant (M-1) of B. poitrasii were isolated after NTG treatment of parent strain spores and studied for their biochemical characteristics. Effects of (i) kind and concentration of carbon source, (ii) presence of complex organic nitrogen and (iii) C:N ratio in the growth medium on the morphology of parent and mutant strains were carried out at 28 degrees C under shaking conditions. Ethanol induced morphological change and its reversal were studied in all the strains in order to elucidate the possible mechanism of morphogenesis.
