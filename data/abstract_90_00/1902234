Calcification is the principal cause of the clinical failure of bioprosthetic heart valves (BHV). Calcification occurs through an interaction of host and implant factors, mainly younger age and glutaraldehyde pretreatment, respectively. The hypothesis of this work was that an impaired balance between positively and negatively charged amino acids, due to the reaction with Lys and Hyl tissue-collagen residues, expose affinity sites to Ca++. We further hypothesized that regardless of the cause(s) of BHV calcification, positive charge modification of the tissues will prevent their propensity to calcify. Modification of BHV tissue was obtained by covalently binding protamine sulfate, a polybasic peptide, via formaldehyde and subsequent glutaraldehyde tissue crosslinking. Protamine-bound tissue exhibited stability properties (shrinkage temperature and resistance to collagenase digestion) similar to BHV tissue. Protamine-treated tissue was less permeable to Ca++, and reduced staining was observed with positively charged dyes, indicating the presence of positively charged functional groups in the modified tissue. Significant prevention of calcification was exhibited by the p-bound tissue in comparison to BHV tissue, 30.9 and 109 micrograms/mg calcium, respectively, after 30 days of subdermal implants in rats. The modification procedure resulted in stable, covalent links of approximately 10% w/w protamine with undiminished anticalcification properties, even after 1 year storage. The results support our hypotheses, and orthotopical heart valve replacements are required in order to completely evaluate the treatment efficacy and biocompatibility.
