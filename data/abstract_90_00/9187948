Resistance continues to spread in nosocomial pathogens in acute care hospitals and other key settings of managed health care systems. Appropriate control measures for such resistant organisms depend, in part, on the pathways by which resistance has arisen. Unfortunately, these pathways differ greatly from organism to organism and setting to setting. Although the epidemiology of resistant organisms sometimes is similar to that of susceptible organisms of the same kind, in some situations it may be quite different. This article highlights some of the pathways leading to the development of resistance in bacteria and the relevance of these mechanisms to measures for the control of resistant bacteria in hospital and community settings.
