The studies aimed at analysing the resistance to some beta-lactam antibiotics among E. coli and K. pneumoniae clinical isolates and at evaluating. The extended spectrum of beta-lactamases (ESBL) production in the isolates. The analysis included 137 E. coli strains and 52 K. pneumoniae strains, isolated from hospitalized patients and out-patients treated in the first trimester of 1998. The strains were identified using the ATB computer system. Antibiotic sensitivity of the isolates was determined by disc-diffusion tests. ESBL production capacity of E. coli and K. pneumoniae strains was estimated by double-disc and ATB BLSA tests. Most of the analysed E. coli strains were found to exhibit significant sensitivity to compound penicillin preparations containing beta-lactam inhibitor (Augmentin, Tazocin) and to the third generation cefalosporins, in contrast, K. pneumoniae strains much more frequently were resistant to the drugs. Among the obtained isolates, 3 (2.2%) E. coli strains and 21 (40.4%) K. pneumoniae strains produced ESBL but all the isolates proved sensitive to imipenem. In evaluation of ESBL production-detecting tests, the double-disc test was found to be more reliable than ATB BLSA test.
