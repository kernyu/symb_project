BACKGROUND: While studying cutaneous leishmaniasis in the central part of western Venezuela, we found four cases of disseminated American cutaneous leishmaniasis, three from the Lara State and one from Portuguesa State. METHODS: A clinical history was taken for each of these patients, followed by microscopic examination of the Giemsastained smears from their cutaneous lesions and by a Montenegro skin test. Serum from a skin lesion were grown in Novy-MacNeal-Nicolle medium (NNN). Hamsters were inoculated with suspension of tissues taken from the patient's lesions. Biopsies were taken for histopathologic examination. Isolates from cultures on NNN medium and from hamsters were subcultured in Schneider's medium for parasite identification, using molecular techniques. Treatment with injections of N-methyl glucamine antimonate, 25 mg/kg/day was prescribed for each patient for 20 consecutive days and, after a week of rest, a second course of injections was administered. RESULTS: Patients had disseminated papular, ulcerous, nodular, and ulceronodular lesions on the skin. Smears of the skin lesions from all of the patients showed abundant amastigotes within histiocytes or free in the tissues. The skin test was negative in two patients. On histopathologic examination of skin lesions, mainly numerous vacuolated histiocytes filled with amastigotes were observed. Isolates from all the patients were identified as Leishmania venezuelensis. One of the patients healed after treatment with N-methyl glucamine antimonate. The others were resistant to this therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis can be caused also by Leishmania venezuelensis. Patients with nodular lesions who presented a negative Montenegro skin test were more resistant to treatment with specific pentavalent antimonials.
