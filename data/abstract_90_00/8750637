We describe two patients who showed a very similar, but atypical course of acute myelogenous leukemia. They demonstrated skin nodules, spinal fluid and CNS involvement whereas bone marrow and blood remained clear. Nonetheless both had cytogenetic findings of trisomy 8 in the marrow and were resistant to a combination of cytarabine, idarubicin, fludarabine, and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor.
