A minocycline (MINO)-resistant mutant was isolated from Mycobacterium smegmatis strain Rabinowitschi. Polypeptide synthesis in the cell-free system prepared from the mutant was resistant to minocycline (MINO) because of alterated 30S ribosomal subunits. Upon two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, two proteins of 30S subunit were found to be altered. MINO resistance phenotype was transferred by mating to the recipient strain P-53. MINO resistance phenotype of a recombinant thus obtained was transferred by a different mating system to the recipient strain Jucho, once again. Ribosomal proteins of each of the donors, recipients and recombinants were analyzed and compared on 2-dimensional (2D) electrophoresis. Approximately 50 ribosomal proteins were observed in 70S ribosomes. Some proteins were differently electrophoresed in different strains. The 30S ribosomal subunits contained at least 19 proteins and 50S ribosomal subunits contained at least 23 proteins. Some proteins were easily washed off during dissociation of subunits in sucrose gradients. At least one protein (designated F) in both subunits was observed at the same position. One protein designated C in 30S subunits could be co-transferred to the recipient cells together with resistance phenotype at the frequency of 100% in the 30 recombinants examined so far. The other protein designated D in 30S subunits could be transferred at the frequency of 86-88%. Three other proteins in 50S subunits could be co-transferred to the recipient strain at a lower frequency. Minocycline resistance, therefore, could be mapped close to genes encoding the structure of ribosomal proteins in M. smegmatis.
