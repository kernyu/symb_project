The effects of polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) and/or clavulanic acid on the bactericidal activity of amoxicillin (at human serum achievable concentrations) against a serotype 3 penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae strain [minimal inhibitory concentration/minimal bactericidal concentration (MIC/MBC) values of penicillin, amoxicillin, and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (2:1) = 0.01/0.01 microgram/ml] and a serotype 9 penicillin-resistant strain [MIC/MBC of penicillin, amoxicillin, and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (2:1) = 1/2 microgram/ml] were studied. Against the penicillin-resistant strain, subinhibitory concentrations of amoxicillin reduced the growth rate; this effect was increased by the addition of clavulanic acid. A reduction of the penicillin-resistant initial inocula (3 x 10(6) cfu/ml) at subinhibitory concentrations was obtained only with amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid and PMNs. At suprainhibitory concentrations, both clavulanic acid and PMNs increased the bactericidal activity of amoxicillin, as evidenced by an increased reduction in the penicillin-resistant initial inocula. The combined effect of these antibiotics and immune defenses may help explain the maintenance of their clinical efficacy in respiratory tract infections, despite the increase in the incidence of penicillin-resistant pneumococci.
