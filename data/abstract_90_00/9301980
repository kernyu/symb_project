The incidence of nosocomial enterococcal infection has increased steadily over the past two decades. The treatment of patients with enterococcal infection has been complicated by the emergence of strains possessing high level resistance to aminoglycosides, penicillins and, most recently, glycopeptides. Several recent studies have evaluated alternative antimicrobial agents for use against strains resistant to some or all standard agents. In this report, we review the therapeutic options for the management of antibiotic-resistant enterococcal infection.
