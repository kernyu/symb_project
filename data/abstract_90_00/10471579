A total of 24,591 nonhuman salmonella strains isolated in Germany between 1986 and 1998 were examined for their resistance to nalidixic acid by an agar diffusion method. The rate of resistance (inhibition zone, </=13 mm) ranged from 0.2% in 1986 to a peak of 14. 8% in 1990. Between 1991 and 1998 the MICs for nalidixic acid-resistant strains ranged from more than 256 microg/ml for nalidixic acid to between 0.25 and 128 microg/ml for enrofloxacin. In the early 1990s a particularly high incidence of fluoroquinolone resistance (49.5%) was seen among isolates of Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium (Salmonella Typhimurium) definitive phage type 204c that mainly originated from cattle. Among isolates from poultry an increase in the incidence of nalidixic acid resistance to a peak of 14.4% was observed in 1994. This peak was due to the presence of specific resistant serotypes, mainly serotypes Hadar, Saintpaul, Paratyphi B (D-tartrate positive; formerly serotype Java) and Newport. Such strains exhibited a decreased susceptibility to enrofloxacin (MIC, 1 microg/ml). Among isolates from pigs the peak incidence of resistance was reached in 1993, with 7.5% of isolates resistant to nalidixic acid and enrofloxacin. The study demonstrates an increase in the incidence of strains that are resistant to nalidixic acid and that have decreased susceptibility to enrofloxacin after the licensing of enrofloxacin. In addition, the number of other serotypes that exhibited nalidixic acid resistance or reduced enrofloxacin susceptibility increased among the total number of isolates investigated between 1992 and 1998.
