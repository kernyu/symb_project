Recently rapid increase in the emergence of multiresistant Gram-positive pathogen such as MRSA, penicillin resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (PRSP), and vancomycin resistant Enterococcus (VRE). Whether quinolone antibacterial agent (quinolone) come to a promising drug or not for the treatment of these infectious diseases, it depend on an appropriate drug design of quinolones which have good toxicological and pharmacokinetic profile along with excellent antibacterial activities against these Gram-positive pathogens. In this chapter, we examine the possibility by following the history of the advances in quinolone research.
