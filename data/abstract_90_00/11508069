Ciprofloxacin was tested against 30 strains of M. tuberculosis; 2 (6.67%) of which were resistant. This is the first report of ciprofloxacin resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis from Bangladesh. All the 5 strains of NTM tested for said 5 anti-tuberculous drugs, were found resistant to more than one.
