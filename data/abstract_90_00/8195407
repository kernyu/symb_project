A simple, rapid susceptibility test is needed to determine the possible resistance of yeasts to commonly used antifungal agents. The BacT/Alert automated blood culture system was evaluated as one technology for development of such a test. Yeast nitrogen base was used as the growth medium, and amphotericin B was the test antifungal agent. Isolates of various Candida species, Torulopsis glabrata, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Cryptococcus neoformans were evaluated. The results suggest that detection of amphotericin B resistance of yeast isolates within 12 to 14 h after inoculation of test medium is possible.
