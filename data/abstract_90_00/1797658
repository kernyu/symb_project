National Salmonella & Escherichia Centre situated at Central Research Institute, Kasauli receives Salmonella strains from all over the country. Eight hundred and fourteen Salmonella strains belonging to 14 serotypes received during 1986 were studied for antibiotic resistance and Minimum Inhibitory concentration (MIC) with regard to ampicillin (A), chloramphenicol (C), furazolidone (Fz) and gentamicin (G). Resistance to ampicillin was found to be highest (80%) and furazolidone the least (0.1%). Similarly a large number of strains (31%) had very high MIC values greater than 640 mcg per ml for chloramphenicol, whereas only 3.4% strains were found to have MIC values greater than 640 mcg per ml for gentamicin. The present findings have been discussed in the light of similar data published from this Centre earlier and from other sources in India.
