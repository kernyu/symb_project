Falciparum malaria is one of the most common infectious illnesses in the world and can progress rapidly to coma and death in the nonimmune patient. The presentation is nonspecific, so blood smears must be made and read quickly. Proper therapy requires taking into account drug resistance, recognizing the signs of severe malaria, and proper treatment for complications. Long-sleeved clothing, bed nets, insecticides, and chemoprophylaxis can help prevent malaria, but the infection must be suspected in any traveler returning from an endemic area. This article reviews epidemiology, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of falciparum malaria in the temperate zone.
