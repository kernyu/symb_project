The prevention of infection in critically ill patients is a difficult and often frustrating task. Selective digestive decontamination may be a useful means of preventing infections in specific patient populations; however, not all critical care patients will benefit. In this article, mechanisms of antimicrobial resistance are discussed along with the consideration of specific measures to deal with this growing dilemma. Concerns about specific microorganisms, such as vancomycin-resistant enterococcus and multidrug-resistant Enterobacter species, are addressed. It is clear that the use of antimicrobial agents is not the only solution to the problem of infection in critically ill patients.
