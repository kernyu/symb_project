From December 1988 to March 1989 172 faecal samples from first and second year students at the University of Limburg, Maastricht, The Netherlands, were collected and analysed for the presence of Escherichia coli strains resistant to ampicillin, sulphamethoxazole, tetracycline, trimethoprim and nitrofurantoin. In addition, the antibiotic susceptibility (MIC) to these agents and six other compounds (i.e. aminoglycosides, nitrofurantoin, nalidixic acid and cephalothin) was determined. The prevalence of resistance of the samples analysed ranged from 86% (i.e. 148 out of 172) for sulphamethoxazole to 25% for trimethoprim. The prevalence figures for ampicillin, tetracycline and nitrofurantoin resistance were 76%, 47% and 29%, respectively. The percentages of the faecal samples with a high proportion of E. coli (greater than 50% of the total number of E. coli) resistant to ampicillin, tetracycline and sulphamethoxazole were 8%, 11% and 37%, respectively. For nitrofurantoin and trimethoprim the figures were 3% and 1%, respectively. Of the isolated E. coli (n = 797), 84% was resistant to ampicillin, 82% resistant to sulphamethoxazole. The lowest percentages (9%) were observed for both nalidixic acid and nitrofurantoin.
