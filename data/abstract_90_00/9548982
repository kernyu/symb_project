In Arabidopsis, NPR1 mediates the salicylic acid (SA)-induced expression of pathogenesis-related (PR) genes and systemic acquired resistance (SAR). Here, we report the identification of another component, CPR 6, that may function with NPR1 in regulating PR gene expression. The dominant CPR 6-1 mutant expresses the SA/NPR1-regulated PR genes (PR-1, BGL 2, and PR-5) and displays enhanced resistance to Pseudomonas syringae pv maculicola ES4326 and Peronospora parasitica Noco2 in the absence of SAR induction. cpr 6-1-induced PR gene expression is not suppressed in the cpr 6-1 npr1-1 double mutant but is suppressed when SA is removed by salicylate hydroxylase. Thus, constitutive PR gene expression in cpr 6-1 requires SA but not NPR1. In addition, resistance to P. s. maculicola ES4326 is suppressed in the cpr 6-1 npr1-1 double mutant, despite expression of PR-1, BGL 2, and PR-5. Resistance to P. s. maculicola ES4326 must therefore be accomplished through unidentified antibacterial gene products that are regulated through NPR1. These results show that CPR 6 is an important regulator of multiple signal transduction pathways involved in plant defense.
