A total of 446 Shigella strains consisting of 336 imported and 110 domestic strains isolated in Tokyo from 1990 to 1994 were examined for their species and serovar-distribution, and their drug-resistance. In both imported and domestic strains, S. sonnei was found to be the most prevalent species, followed by S. flexneri. In imported strains, however, the isolation frequency of S. flexneri, S. boydii and S. dysenteriae were higher than that of domestic strains, and the serovar of each species was distributed in a wider range than that of the domestic strains. Provisional new serovar Shigella strains were isolated from 8 imported cases and 2 domestic cases. The drug-resistance-test using 9 drugs (CP, TC, SM, KM, ABPC, ST, NA, FOM, and NFLX) showed that 82.7% of the imported strains and 89.1% of the domestic strains were resistant to any drugs examined. Drugs of a high resistant rate were SM, TC, ST for the both groups. Drug-resistance-patterns of the resistant isolates varied to 21 types. Among those, a triple drug-resistance-type with TC SM ST was found the most frequently in both groups. None of the strains were resistant to FOM or NFLX.
