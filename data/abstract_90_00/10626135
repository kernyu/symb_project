The minimum inhibitory concentrations of six broad-spectrum beta-lactam antimicrobial agents were determined in 1998 by use of the Etest versus a total of 823 bacteria in 11 Colombian hospital laboratories. These data were compared with results of a similar study conducted in 1997. The organisms tested included 532 recent clinical isolates of Enterobacteriaceae, 108 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 94 Acinetobacter species, and 89 oxacillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase production was noted among 27.8 to 33.9% of Escherichia coli isolates and 41.7 to 46.7% of Klebsiella spp. isolates. Hyperproduction of Amp C cephalosporinases was observed with 10.5 to 31.4% of isolates of Enterobacter spp., Serratia spp., and Citrobacter spp. An increase in resistance to all of the beta-lactams was observed among Enterobacteriaceae, Acinetobacter spp. and P. aeruginosa when 1998 results were compared with those obtained in 1997. The overall rank order of activity of the six beta-lactams tested in 1998 versus all clinical isolates was imipenem (93.2% susceptible) > cefoperazone/sulbactam (84.1%) > cefepime (80.9%) > ceftazidime (70.7%) > aztreonam (65.7%) > cefotaxime (65.6%). In contrast, the rank order of these same agents tested against a similar collection of Colombian isolates in 1997 was imipenem (96.6% susceptible) > cefepime (93.6%) > cefoperazone/sulbactam (90.5%) > cefotaxime (74.9%) > aztreonam (74.3%) > ceftazidime (73.2%).
