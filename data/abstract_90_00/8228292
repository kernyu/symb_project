The first study of the prevalence in Singapore of enterococci with high-level resistance to aminoglycosides has been made in the National University Hospital. From March to June 1992, 225 isolates were studied by means of three methods: (1) use of brain-heart infusion (BHI) agar incorporating the antibiotic; (2) microdilution of the antibiotic in broth; and (3) use of high content antibiotic discs. The BHI agar was the reference method. Of the total, 49 (22%) isolates were resistant to gentamicin, 86 (38%) to streptomycin, 82 (36%) to kanamycin and 93 (41%) to one or more of the agents. Results of the disc diffusion method correlated completely with the BHI agar method. The broth microdilution method showed a 100, 90 and 96% sensitivity in relation to gentamicin, streptomycin and kanamycin, respectively, and a specificity of 100% for all three aminoglycosides. Statistical significance (P < 0.01 to P < 0.001) was demonstrated in (1) a greater incidence of enterococci with high-level resistance to aminoglycosides among blood isolates; (2) gentamicin resistance predicting kanamycin high-level resistance; and (3) more resistance to gentamicin, streptomycin and kanamycin among Enterococcus faecium isolates compared to those of Enterococcus faecalis. Beta-lactamase activity was not detected.
