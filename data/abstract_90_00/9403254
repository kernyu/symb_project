The numbers of patients in intensive care units, with immunosuppression, and of elderly people increase in parallel with antibiotic-resistant microorganisms. Therefore the demand for an effective antisepsis increases. Moreover, it became evident that the pathophysiology and the outcome of infection are dependent on the properties of the microorganisms, e.g. synthesis of endo- and exotoxins, and on the host defense, the immune system. In addition to the microbicidal action, we studied the effects of povidone-iodine (PVP-I, Betaisodona) on the generation, release and activity of exotoxins (alpha-hemolysin, phospholipase C, lipase), as well as on granulocyte-derived tissue-destructive enzymes (elastase, beta-glucuronidase) and microbial-induced cytokine generation from human neutrophils. Our results clearly show that PVP-I does not only kill a wide range of bacteria but also inhibits the generation and release of bacterial exotoxins; furthermore, it also inactivates bacterial exotoxins as well as granulocyte-derived tissue-destructive enzymes and cytokines. These data support the usefulness and efficacy of PVP-I as an effective therapeutic agent to combat infection.
