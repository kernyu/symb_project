A total of 330 strains of psychrotrophic non-fermenting Gram-negative bacteria isolated from vegetables were studied. In spite of the wide range of antibiotic resistance occurring, less than 10% showed resistance patterns which included mezclocillin-ticarcillin-gentamicin or ceftizoxime-norfloxacin. Reductions of > 5 log10 in the numbers of cfu were found when these strains were exposed for 30 min to a quaternary ammonium compound (1% w/v).
