Infection with acyclovir-resistant herpes simplex-virus is now a clinical reality in patients with AIDS or who are otherwise immunocompromised. The most common mechanism of resistance is selection of mutants with inability to express thymidine kinase activity. Vidarabine, foscarnet and gancyclovir can be used to treat infections with acyclovir resistant virus. In recent years there have been many reports of drug resistance from the treatment of other virus infections too.
