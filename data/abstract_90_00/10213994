The susceptibility of Streptococcus agalactiae (S. agalactiae) clinical isolates of Juntendo University Urayasu Hospital, and type strain ATCC 13813 to beta-lactam antimicrobial agents was evaluated by means of macro-broth dilution MIC determination, killing kinetics and population analysis. When 10(6) cells of S. agalactiae were inoculated and cultured in Todd-Hewitt broth containing two-fold serial dilutions of penicillin, the viable cell count showed that about 10(2) cells survived irrespective of the penicillin concentration which ranged from 0.063 to 128 micrograms/ml. The result indicated that S. agalactiae had tolerance to penicillin (MICs were around 0.063 microgram/ml). Furthermore, the S. agalactiae strains were found to have a paradoxical response to penicillin in an acidic condition (pH 5.5). When the cell counts were performed at pH 5.5, about 10(2) cells survived at penicillin concentrations from 0.016 to 0.125 microgram/ml, while about 10(4) cells survived at the concentrations of 1 to 8 micrograms/ml. The antibiotic tolerance and paradoxical effects of S. agalactiae were also observed in killing kinetics. The ATCC 13,813 and 10 out of 11 clinical strains showed slow response to penicillin-mediated killing at pH 7.8 and ATCC 13,813 and one of the clinical strains showed a reduced response with increase in penicillin concentration at pH 5.5. These results suggested that the tolerance and paradoxical effect of S. agalactiae cells to beta-lactam antibiotics may be one of the reasons for frequent re-colonization of S. agalactiae at the time of delivery after the chemophylaxis in the 2nd trimester.
