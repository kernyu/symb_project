With numerous imipenem-resistant clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa as well as in vitro-selected resistant mutants, we have demonstrated, by a simple method with a powerful cephalosporinase inhibitor, BRL42715, the contribution of chromosomal cephalosporinase in resistance to imipenem in this species.
