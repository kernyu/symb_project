The epidemiological survey of APH (3') I and APH (3') II genes, at a time when the specific antibiotic pressure was very low, was carried out by DNA-DNA hybridization. The sample included 334 aminoglycoside resistant Gram-negative bacteria collected from patients of a General Hospital. Of these, 251 hybridized with the APH (3') I-probe and 19 with the APH (3') II-probe but only 190 strains showed high resistance levels (CIM greater than 64 micrograms/ml) for kanamycin, neomycin and paromomycin. These strains were isolated both from inpatients and outpatients with different infectious diseases. The APH (3') I-gene was dispersed among all the bacterial species and clinical specimens tested but the APH (3') II-gene was not found in Pseudomonas spp, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii and Enterobacter cloacae, nor in infected catheters. Several plasmids of different sizes carrying APH (3') genes were detected among different bacteria. Plasmids along with transposable elements (the probes used in this work were developed from Tn906 and Tn5) and the high consumption of other antibiotics whose resistance is carried by these bacteria might be playing an important role in the maintenance and dispersion of APH (3') genes.
