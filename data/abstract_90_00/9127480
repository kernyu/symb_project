A total of 47 clinical isolates and 52 poultry isolates of Campylobacter jejuni were characterized by their resistance to 16 antimicrobial agents and by plasmid profiles on agarose gel electrophoresis. Almost all isolates were susceptible to erythromycin, chloramphenicol, gentamycin and nitrofuratoin. Plasmids were detected in 19% of C. jejuni strains isolated from feces of children patients and in 36% of strains isolated from chicken. The presence of plasmid DNA was not found to be correlated with any definite resistance, despite of the number of resistant strains was also higher among poultry isolates. Plasmids, as well, does not seem to be essential for colonization of alimentary tract of pathogenic activity.
