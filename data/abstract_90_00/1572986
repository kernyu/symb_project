Presently, most Neisseria gonorrhoeae testing is based on beta-lactamase tests and agar dilution with common therapeutic agents. The National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) recently described a disk diffusion test that produced results similar to the reference agar dilution method for the antibiotic susceptibility of N. gonorrhoeae. We obtained 71 gonococcal isolates from active-duty males aboard a United States Navy vessel while deployed in the Western Pacific during 1989. In addition, 47 isolates of N. gonorrhoeae were obtained from sexually transmitted disease clinics within the branch clinic operations of the Naval Hospital, San Diego (SD), and tested. Antibiotic susceptibility tests by using the NCCLS agar dilution and disk diffusion techniques were compared. Among the Southeast Asia (SEA) isolates, 47% were beta-lactamase producers compared with 10.5% of the SD isolates. The mean MICs (SEA/SD) in micrograms per milliliter for both groups were as follows: penicillin, 88/15; tetracycline, 2.2/0.95; erythromycin, 1.2/0.49; ceftriaxone, 0.016/0.012; cefotaxime, 0.034/0.03; cefuroxime, 0.44/0.17; cefoxitin, 1.3/0.97; spectinomycin, 150/131; ciprofloxacin, 0.07/0.034; norfloxacin, 0.77/0.29; lomefloxacin, 0.15/0.0.056; and ofloxacin, 0.07/0.036. The established NCCLS interpretive criteria for both susceptibility methods appear applicable to domestic gonococcal strains. However, modifications may be necessary for the more antimicrobial agent-resistant SEA isolates on the basis of the clinical success and cure rates following the indicated single-dose regimens for the geographic region.
