From September 1997 to March 1998, forty patients with cerebral disorders were investigated. They were divided into two groups: one treated and the other untreated. Mupirocin calcium ointment (MCO) was applied three times a day for three days into the nasal cavities of the patients in the treated group. In order to check the growth of MRSA (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus), bacterial isolation culture from the nasal cavity was carried out on admission, one week after admission and one month after admission. MRSA was nor detected in isolation culture of any of the cases on admission. One week later MRSA was detected in isolation culture of one case of the 20 MCO treated patients and in three of the 20 untreated patients. There was no significant difference between treated and untreated groups. In isolation culture after one month, MRSA was recognized in four cases of 16 in the MCO treated group (three patients were discharged and one expired). On the other hand, it was recognized in eight cases of thirteen in the untreated group (seven cases were discharged). MRSA infection of the nasal cavity decreased significantly due to MCO treatment (p < 0.05). It is suggested that the nasal carriage of MRSA was prevented by intranasal application of MCO on admission.
