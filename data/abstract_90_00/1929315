We tested 75 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains for susceptibility to imipenem by using disk diffusion tests and broth microdilution tests with standard and heavy inocula. Population analysis was performed on isolates that appeared to be susceptible by these methods. All of the strains contained subpopulations of cells that are phenotypically resistant to imipenem.
