Detection of mutations in the rpoB gene of Mycobacterium tuberculosis has been reported to be an accurate predictor of rifampin resistance. DNA sequence analysis and screening methods such as single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis and dideoxy fingerprinting are labor-intensive, expensive, or yield results that may prove difficult to interpret. We evaluated the accuracy of a commercial line probe assay for rapid identification and characterization of mutations in the rpoB gene in 72 isolates of M. tuberculosis, including 50 rifampin-resistant and 22 rifampin-susceptible strains. Ten distinct rpoB mutations were identified. Concordances with automated sequencing results and phenotypic rifampin susceptibility testing results were 99% and 93%, respectively. The results demonstrate the line probe assay to be a rapid (as short as 1 day) and informative tool for the early detection and characterization of rpoB mutations associated with rifampin resistance in a clinical laboratory setting.
