Twenty-five isolates of beta-lactamase-negative strains of Neisseria gonorrhoeae exhibiting decreased susceptibilities to ciprofloxacin (MIC, > or = 0.125 microgram/ml) were isolated from men with uncomplicated gonococcal urethritis in Cleveland, Ohio, from January 1992 through June 1993. The strains belonged to three auxotype-serovar classes: Pro-IB-1 (2 isolates), Pro-IB-2 (21 isolates), and Pro-IB-3 (2 isolates). MICs for strains were in the intermediate or resistant categories for penicillin, the intermediate or susceptible categories for tetracycline (with the exception of one strain that had acquired the 25.2-MDa TetM-containing plasmid) and cefoxitin, and the susceptible categories for ceftriaxone and cefixime (MICs, < or = 0.25 microgram/ml) and spectinomycin (MIC, < or = 256 micrograms/ml). MICs for strains were also in the susceptible category for ofloxacin (MIC, 0.25 microgram/ml) and in categories higher than susceptible for ciprofloxacin (MICs, 0.125 to 0.25 microgram/ml) and ofloxacin (MIC, 0.5 microgram/ml). The diameters of zones of inhibition for these strains ranged from 31 to 39 mm for ciprofloxacin to 28 to 35 mm for ofloxacin. The persistence of these strains over an 18-month period supports the need for routine sentinel surveillance and monitoring of gonococcal isolates, particularly posttreatment isolates, for resistance to quinolones when these agents are used for the primary therapy of uncomplicated gonorrhea.
