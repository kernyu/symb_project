Gastroenteritis caused by a multidrug-resistant Salmonella typhimurium was diagnosed in a 12-week-old kitten. Although the kitten recovered from the acute episode after seven days, it continued to shed salmonella in its faeces for a further 12 weeks. Carriage was finally cleared by administering a 14-day course of treatment with parenteral enrofloxacin. The public health implications of an infection and subsequent carriage in a cat of a salmonella strain known to cause illness in humans is discussed.
