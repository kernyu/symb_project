The results of treating 322 patients with various forms of meningococcal infection accepted to a hospital within a year are presented. The patients were divided into 3 groups by the character of etiotropic therapy. The patients of group I were treated with benzylpenicillin and those of group 2 were treated with levomycetin sodium succinate. Group 3 included the patients, the therapy of whom with the above two antibiotics failed and they were subjected to treatment with cefazolin, cefotaxime, amikacin and other broad spectrum antibiotics. Benzylpenicillin generally proved to be the drug of choice in the antibacterial therapy of meningococcal infection. In comparison to levomycetin (chloramphenicol) it provide more rapid clinical recovery of the patients and normalization of the indices of the cerebrospinal fluid. Only failure of benzylpenicillin therapy was considered as an indication to the broad-spectrum antibiotics to be in the complex treatment of the patients. As additional methods for estimating the efficacy of antibacterial therapy it was recommended to employ calculation of the integral indices of hemograms (the leukocyte index of intoxication and the hematologic index of intoxication).
