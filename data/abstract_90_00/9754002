A 46-year-old man with a history of left upper lobectomy for pulmonary tuberculosis was admitted to our hospital because of dilated cardiomyopathy. During hospitalization, fever and weight loss developed. The cause was suspected to be a round mass inside a cavity and a neighboring infiltrative shadow in the left upper lung field as seen on chest radiography. A percutaneous needle biopsy was done, and examination of the specimen showed an aggregate of Aspergillus fumigatus hyphae. Fluconazole (FCZ) was injected through an intracavitary catheter every day, and was then given by mouth. Treatment with FCZ was effective temporarily. However, he was again admitted to our hospital because of lower extension of the cavity and deteriorated inflammatory findings. From the clinical course, chronic necrotizing pulmonary aspergillosis was diagnosed. Treatment with all available antifungal agents did not improve his condition. Although he had decreased cardiac function due to dilated cardiomyopathy, partial pulmonary resection was done. The cavity with the fungus ball was resected completely. As of the time of this writing, he remains free of aspergillosis.
