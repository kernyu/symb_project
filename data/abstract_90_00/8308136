We used the scheme of Lior to biotype 140 genetically identified Campylobacter strains. Our results confirmed previous studies and extended Lior biotyping to show that nine C. jejuni subsp. doylei strains (100%) were one biotype and nine C. jejuni subsp. jejuni nalidixic acid-resistant strains (100%) were C. jejuni biotype I or II. All C. jejuni subsp. jejuni hippurate-negative strains studied and 6 of 35 C. lari strains (17%) were grouped with C. coli biotypes. These findings may be useful in epidemiologic investigations.
