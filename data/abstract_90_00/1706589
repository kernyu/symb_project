The virus- and interferon-inducible human MxA (IFI-78k) gene is a homologue of the murine influenza resistance gene Mx1. Three overlapping human cosmid clones covering most of the gene including its promoter region were isolated. Sequencing the 5' MxA cDNA derived by RT-PCR (reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction) confirmed the most 5' putative transcriptional start site. The MxA promoter does not contain a TATA or CCAAT box but has three Interferon Stimulated Response Element (ISRE) motifs. Strong induction with type I interferons was demonstrated with a fragment containing only two ISREs in human L132 cells. This induced expression was not adversely affected by 2-aminopurine. However, the promoter showed constitutive expression in transiently or stably transfected murine LM cells.
