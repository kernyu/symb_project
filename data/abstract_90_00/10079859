The recent increase of the number of antimicrobials and isolation of antibiotic resistant strains from humans and environmental objects is indicative of the necessity of further investigation of antibiotic susceptibility of the representatives of the genus Vibrio pathogenic for man to provide rational therapy of the diseases due to them. Susceptibility of 160 strains of pathogenic vibrios of 9 species to 11 antibiotics and chemotherapeutic drugs was assayed by the method of serial dilutions in agar media. The isolates were shown to be highly susceptible to chloramphenicol, doxycycline, cefotaxime, nalidixic acid and ciprofloxacin which made it possible to consider them as the drugs of choice in the treatment of the diseases caused by the microorganisms. A tendency to form polyantibiotic resistant strains within every species of tested pathogenic vibrios was observed. It conditioned the prospects of further profound study of the phenomenon with the analysis of the genetic determination of antibiotic resistance markers in pathogenic vibrios.
