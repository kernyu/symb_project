The antibiotic sensitivity of 338 microbial cultures isolated from patients with inflammatory renal and urinary diseases was studied. 66.3 per cent of the isolates proved to be poly-resistant which corresponded to rurological patient specificity. It was shown that abactal (pefloxacin, LEK, Yugoslavia) had a higher antimicrobial activity than the nonfluorinated quinolones especially against Staphylococci and a lower antimicrobial activity than the fluorinated quinolones in vitro. The abactal sensitivity to Pseudomonas aeruginosa amounted only to 23 per cent which was likely to be due to development of cross-resistance to ofloxacin. 1/3 of the polyresistant isolates were sensitive to abactal. The activity of abactal weakly depended on the medium pH. The MBC was generally no more than 2 MICs.
