Several isolates of vancomycin-resistant Lactobacillus confusus from human sources have been described, but to our knowledge, no well-documented infection attributable to this organism has been published. A thumb abscess caused by this bacterium in a healthy 49-year-old male is reported here. He was successfully treated by surgical drainage and cephalothin.
