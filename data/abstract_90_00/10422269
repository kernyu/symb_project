Vaginal candidiasis continues to be a common cause of vaginal discharge, pruritus and other local complaints in women worldwide. Although numerous antimycotic agents are available for the treatment of yeast vaginitis there is little comparative data on the in vitro activity of these drugs. The objectives of this study were to isolate and identify the Candida species in the vagina and anus of patients treated in a gynaecology clinic, as well as determine the susceptibility to azolic compounds measured by the E-test method. Vaginal and rectal swabs were collected from 80 adult non-pregnant patients, seen at a gynaecological clinic, aged 18-59 years, with sexual activity, with and without vaginitis. The swabs were processed by methods routinely used for the detection of pathogenic yeasts. The susceptibility of the isolates to fluconazole, ketoconazole and itraconazole, was measured by the agar diffusion method (E-test), using RPM1 1,640 medium with 2% glucose and phosphate buffer. Candida species (33) strains were isolated from 17 patients at similar proportions from both anatomical sites, and 12 patients harboured 24 strains of C. albicans in the vaginal and rectal tracts. Twenty one percent of the strains of C. albicans were resistant to ketoconazole, 54% were resistant to itraconazole and 0% were resistant to fluconazole. The sensitivity of strains isolated from the two sites were similar, indicating that these are strains of the same phenotype.
