Lactococcus lactis strains isolated from vegetable products transferred the ability to ferment sucrose in conjugation experiments with the recipient strain L. lactis MG1614. Nisin production and sucrose fermentation were transferred together from two strains, but transfer also occurred from several other strains which did not produce nisin. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analysis showed that all transconjugants had acquired large chromosomal insertions at two main sites. Nisin sucrose transconjugants had gained inserts of 70 kb, while those that fermented sucrose without nisin production contained inserts of between 50 and 110 kb. Transconjugants from one donor had acquired a separate insertion of 55 kb which correlated with enhanced bacteriophage resistance, but contained neither nisin nor sucrose fermentation genes.
