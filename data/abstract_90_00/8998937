Goal of this contribution was a review concerning the different risks of application of drugs in food producing animals, excluding the development of resistance in pathogenic bacteria. Especially the risks of displacements of drugs and additives during the process of production of medicated feeds and its use under field conditions are concerned. Furthermore water medication and its problems of risks are presented. The onset of drug residues in food--inspite of the use of unmedicated feeds and water--is discussed for example as a consequence of contamination of feeds (especially in wet feeding systems in pigs), the surrounding and/or litters.
