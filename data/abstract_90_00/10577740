Because it is widely accepted that there is a significant difference in susceptibility to chronic infection by Toxoplasma gondii among inbred mouse strains with different genetic backgrounds, we compared the distribution of the protozoa in digestive organs at early stages of infection between resistant (BALB/c) and susceptible (C57BL/ 6) mice after peroral infection with Fukaya strain cysts. Furthermore, to determine the influence of interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) on the infectivity of the cysts to the digestive tract, homozygous IFN-gamma knockout mice were utilized. Quantitative competitive polymerase chain reaction (QC-PCR) was employed to assess the distribution of T. gondii in different organs at various times after ingestion of cysts. SAG1, a T. gondii-specific gene, was detected in the small intestine and the caecum in wild-type C57BL/6 mice and in the whole digestive tract in IFN-gamma knockout C57BL/6 at 24 hr after infection. No detectable reaction in QC-PCR was observed in BALB/c mice at 24 hr after ingestion of the cysts. Destruction of the IFN-gamma gene showed less effect on the resistance to infection in BALB/c mice, but remarkable augmentation of infectivity of T. gondii to the rectum and peripheral blood was observed in C57BL/6 mice.
