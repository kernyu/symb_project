Since the introduction of antibiotics, bacteria have not only evolved elegant resistance mechanisms to thwart their effect, but have also evolved ways in which to disseminate themselves or their resistance genes to other susceptible bacteria. During the past few years, research has revealed not only how such resistance mechanisms have been able to evolve and to rapidly disseminate, but also how bacteria have, in some cases, been able to adapt to this new burden of resistance with little or no cost to their fitness. Such adaptations make the control of these superbugs all the more difficult.
