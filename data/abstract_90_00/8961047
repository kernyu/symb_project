The increasing antimicrobial resistance among pathogens frequently isolated from patients with bacterial meningitis formed the rationale to perform a surveillance study to determine the prevalence of resistance in The Netherlands. Haemophilus influenzae strains (n = 316) isolated from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), 1125 meningococcal strains isolated from blood or CSF and 398 pneumococcal strains isolated from CSF in 1993 and 1994 were tested by the Etest for susceptibility to commonly prescribed antibiotics for the treatment of community-acquired meningitis. In H. influenzae strains ampicillin-resistance occurred in 7.0%, resistance to chloramphenicol in 2.2%, and resistance to both antibiotics in 0.9%. The prevalence of intermediate penicillin-resistance in meningococci was 3.3%. Resistance to rifampicin was rarely found (0.1%). Intermediate penicillin-resistance in pneumococci was found in only 0.5% of isolates. All 1839 isolates were susceptible to ceftriaxone. Based on these results, we conclude that empirical therapy of childhood community-acquired bacterial meningitis with amoxycillin and chloramphenicol is no longer justified in children who have not been vaccinated against H. influenzae type b. In vaccinated or older children and adults, amoxycillin is a rational choice for empirical treatment of meningitis. The prophylactic use of rifampicin in contacts of patients with meningococcal disease is still applicable.
