Pneumococcal osteomyelitis probably was more common in the pre-antibiotic era, but currently is rare. Sickle-cell disease and possibly, bone trauma and advanced age are predisposing factors for pneumococcal osteomyelitis. Bone infection usually occurs as a result of hematogenous spread from an infective focus, which often cannot be identified. In patients without evidence of other focci of infection, pneumococcal spondylodiscitis probably is caused by "primary" pneumococcal bacteriemia, originating in the oropharynx, especially if the patient has alterations that disrupt the oropharyngeal mucose. Whereas early in the antibiotic era, all Streptococcus pneumoniae strains were susceptible to penicillin, resistance to this antibiotic is on the rise, and in many parts of the world, it has emerged as a major problem. We report the case of a young patient with penicillin-resistant pneumococcal vertebral and intervertebral disk disease who had no evidence of pneumococcal infection elsewhere, and we discuss the possible mechanism of infection. We also review briefly the resistance to penicillin of S. pneumoniae and the treatment of choice.
