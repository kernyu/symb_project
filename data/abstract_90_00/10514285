The further development of allosteric HIV-1 RT inhibitors in the urea analogue series of PETT (phenylethylthiazolylthiourea) derivatives is described here. The series includes derivatives with an ethyl linker (1-5) and racemic (6-16) and enantiomeric (17-20) cis-cyclopropane compounds. The antiviral activity was determined both at the RT level and in cell culture on both wild-type and mutant forms of HIV-1. Most compounds have anti-HIV-1 activity on the wt in the nanomolar range. Resistant HIV-1 was selected in vitro for some of the compounds, and the time for resistant HIV-1 to develop was longer for urea-PETT compounds than it was for reference compounds. Preliminary pharmacokinetics in rats showed that compound 18 is orally bioavailable and penetrates well into the brain. The three-dimensional structure of complexes between HIV-1 RT and two enantiomeric compounds (17 and 18) have been determined. The structures show similar binding in the NNI binding pocket. The propionylphenyl moieties of both inhibitors show perfect stacking to tyrosine residues 181 and 188. The cyclopropyl moiety of the (+)-enantiomer 18 exhibits optimal packing distances for the interactions with leucine residue 100 and valine residue 179.
