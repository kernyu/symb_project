We evaluated an agar disk diffusion method for determining the susceptibility of Mycobacterium avium complex to clarithromycin. Isolates were inoculated onto the surface of a Middlebrook 7H11 plate, followed by the application of a 15-microgram clarithromycin disk. Zone sizes were read after 5-7 days of incubation. Zone sizes had a bimodal distribution; 40 isolates (10%) had no zone of inhibition, whereas the zone sizes for the remaining isolates ranged from 11 to 60 mm. Most isolates (37/40) having no zone of inhibition came from patients who had been treated previously with clarithromycin. Fifty-one isolates were also tested for clarithromycin susceptibility using a microdilution broth method. Defining susceptibility as a zone size of > 10 mm, disk diffusion test results agreed with the results by the microdilution broth method for 50 of 51 (98%) isolates tested by both methods. Agar disk diffusion is a promising method for the determination of clarithromycin susceptibility testing for M. avium complex.
