Doppler spectra were recorded at different cyclosporin A (CSA) levels (trough and peak) in 30 stable renal-transplanted outpatients: 15 with unimpaired renal function (plasma creatinine < 150 mumol/l) and 15 with renal impairment (plasma creatinine 150-350 mumol/l). Pulsatility (PI) and resistive indexes (RI) have been measured in the renal artery at the hilum and in the renal cortex. RI and PI were markedly increased (p < 0.0001) in the cortex at peak time while in the renal artery no significant changes were observed. These variations were statistically related with CSA blood levels (PI = p < 0.02; r = 0.54, RI = p < 0.05; r = 0.45). These effects were also found in the presence of renal damage. CSA dose-dependently reduces cortical blood flow, causing a persistent arteriolar vasoconstriction and a reduction in diastolic flow. This effect can be measured in man in a noninvasive and repeatable way using color Doppler sonograms.
