Twenty-two plant organs from eleven plants comprising five families were extracted and screened for antiplasmodial activity in vitro against Plasmodium falciparum 3D7 (chloroquine sensitive) and Dd2 (chloroquine resistant and pyrimethamine sensitive). Fifty nine percent of plant extracts from 22 extracts exerted activity on P. falciparum strain 3D7 with an IC(50) less than 50 microg/mL, whereas 43% of plant extracts showed an IC(50) value within 50 microg/mL on Dd2 strains. Plant extracts from Gardenia lutea, Haplophyllum tuberculatum, Cassia tora, Acacia nilotica and Aristolochia bracteolata possessed IC(50) values less than 5 microg/mL on both tested strains. Bioassay guided fractionation of A. nilotica revealed that the ethyl acetate extract possessed the highest activity (IC(50) = 1.5 microg/mL). Fraction 2 (R(f) = 0.75) prepared by preparative chromatography showed the highest activity on P. falciparum (IC(50) = 1.7 microg/mL). Phytochemical analysis indicated that the most active phase contained terpenoids and tannins and was devoid of alkaloids and saponins. The effect of plant extracts on lymphocyte proliferation showed low toxicity to the human cells. This plant has been subjected to long term clinical trials in folk medicine and is a promising plant.
