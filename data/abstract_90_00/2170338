Selection was performed for resistance to a phage, Ox2, specific for the Escherichia coli outer membrane protein OmpA, under conditions which excluded recovery of ompA mutants. All mutants analyzed produced normal quantities of OmpA, which was also normally assembled in the outer membrane. They had become essentially resistant to OmpC and OmpF-specific phages and synthesized these outer membrane porins at much reduced rates. The inhibition of synthesis acted at the level of translation. This was due to the presence of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) with defective core oligosaccharides. Cerulenin blocks fatty acid synthesis and therefore that of LPS. It also inhibits synthesis of OmpC and OmpF but not of OmpA (C. Bocquet-Pages, C. Lazdunski, and A. Lazdunski, Eur. J. Biochem. 118:105-111, 1981). In the presence of the antibiotic, OmpA synthesis and membrane incorporation remained unaffected at a time when OmpC and OmpF synthesis had almost ceased. The similarity of these results with those obtained with the mutants suggests that normal porin synthesis is not only interfered with by production of mutant LPS but also requires de novo synthesis of LPS. Since synthesis and assembly of OmpA into the outer membrane was not affected in the mutants or in the presence of cerulenin, association of this protein with LPS appears to occur with outer membrane-located LPS.
