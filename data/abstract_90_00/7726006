Clones derived from HIV variants previously characterized as resistant to Ro31-8959, an inhibitor of viral proteinase (PR), were sequenced. Substitution of glycine by valine at position 48 of the PR protein was found. None of the 20 clones derived from wild type HTLV-IIIB contain this mutation. Since such a position is located in a conserved region of PR, it is possible that the substitution can affect the interaction of the enzyme with the inhibitor.
