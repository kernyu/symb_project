PGG-Glucan [Betafectin], a highly purified soluble beta-(1-6)-branched beta-(1 3)-linked glucan isolated from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, has broad in vitro and in vivo anti-infective activities unrelated to cytokine induction. Here we present in vivo results on the anti-infective activity of PGG-Glucan against a multiple antibiotic resistant Staphylococcus aureus. PGG-Glucan (0.25-4 mg/kg) was administered intramuscularly to male Wistar rats 48 h, 24 h, and 4 h before and 4 h after intraperitoneal implantation of a gelatin capsule containing 10(8)S. aureus colony forming units (CFU). Blood samples were collected at various times after challenge to determine CFU levels, leukocyte counts and neutrophil oxidative burst activity; serum TNF-alpha, and IL-1beta levels were also evaluated. The 0.25 mg/kg PGG-Glucan dose had no effect on reducing blood CFU levels; however, PGG-Glucan doses of 0.5 mg/kg, 1 mg/kg, 2 mg/kg or 4 mg/kg significantly reduced blood CFU levels by 48 h after challenge. Reduced CFU levels correlated with significantly elevated absolute monocyte counts, absolute neutrophil counts, and neutrophil oxidative burst activity in the absence of any effect on TNF-alpha or on IL-1beta levels. In additional studies, effects on mortality and blood CFU levels were evaluated in rats treated with ampicillin (an antibiotic to which the S. aureus was resistant), PGG-Glucan, or both agents. Mortality and blood CFU levels were reduced most in combination-treated rats compared to saline control rats or rats treated with either ampicillin alone or PGG-Glucan alone. We conclude that in vivo (1) PGG-Glucan can enhance clearance of an antibiotic resistant S. aureus, (2) that this clearance is accompanied by an increase in monocytes and neutrophils as well as a potentiation of neutrophil oxidative microbiocidal activity without alteration of the proinflammatory cytokine response, and (3) PGG-Glucan can enhance the effectiveness of traditional antibiotic treatment.
