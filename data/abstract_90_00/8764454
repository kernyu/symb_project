Since the emergence of chemoresistant malaria in Africa at the end of the 1970's, many scientific papers have been published. However, terms used in chemoresistant studies and interpretation of tests are not always appropriate. Based on the usual operative definitions, this paper updates methods of chemoresistance study, interpretation of tests and the course of action to take in case of resistance. Our emphasis is on symptomatic people. We distinguish the clinical response and the parasitological response, two notions which are often confused. A diagram is presented for interpreting the different types of responses of in vivo testing in symptomatic people. For adequate case management of malaria, rigorous analysis of chemoresistant malaria and accurate interpretation of the test results are required.
