Susceptibility of 150 Corynebacterium isolates (91 strains of C.pseudodiphtheriticum and 59 strains of the ANF group corynebacteria) to 21 antibacterial drugs was determined by the method of serial dilutions in a solid medium. It was shown that the MIC of the drugs for the diphtheroids was within the ranges of < 0.015 to > 32.0 micrograms/ml. 66 per cent of the Corynebacterium strains circulating in St. Petersburg was resistant at least to 1 antibacterial drug. The Corynebacterium isolates with moderate resistance to erythromycin and lincomycin (57.3 per cent) and resistant to trimethoprime (16.7 per cent) were the most frequent. 8.0 per cent of the diphtheroids was resistant at least to 4 antibacterial drugs. No significant difference in the susceptibility of the ANF group corynebacteria and C.pseudodiphtheriticum to the drugs was observed. Gentamicin, rifampicin, tetracycline and doxycycline showed high activity against the corynebacteria at present circulating in St. Petersburg. When antibacterial therapy of the infection due to corynebacteria fails it is necessary to estimate antibioticograms of Corynebacterium pure cultures.
