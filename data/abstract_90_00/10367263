Susceptibilities to various antimicrobial agents were examined for Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Echerichia coli, Klebsiella spp., and Pseudomonas aeruginosa that were isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 9 hospitals during June 1997 to May 1998, and the results were compared with those obtained during the same period in earlier years. 1. E. faecalis The MIC90s of quinolones for E. faecalis isolated from uncomplicated UTIs have changed better state during the latest period. Among E. faecalis strains, those with high susceptibilities to ampicillin (ABPC) and minocycline (MINO) appeared to had decreased during period of 1995-1997, which recovered during the latest period. 2. S. aureus The sensitive strains of S. aureus to imipenem (IPM) and clindamycin (CLDM) had increased during the period of 1996-1997, but those have decreased again during the latest period. 3. E. coli The susceptibilities of E. coli to MINO have been better in the latest period with the MIC90 was ranged from 2 to 4 micrograms/ml. The susceptibilities to quinolones of E. coli isolated from complicated UTIs had decreased during the period of 1995-1997, but those have recovered during the latest period. 4. Klebsiella spp. Among Klebsiella spp. strains isolated from uncomplicated UTIs, those with low susceptibilities to almost cephems have increased in the latest period. To other antimicrobial agents, the susceptibilities of Klebsiella spp. did not show any changes during the latest period. 5. P. aeruginosa The susceptibilities to most agents of P. aeruginosa did not show any changes, the decreased susceptibilities to cefozopran (CZOP), carbapenems and monobactams of P. aeruginosa observed in 1996 appeared to have been retrieved in 1997. These susceptibility changes should be utilized in determining clinical treatments.
