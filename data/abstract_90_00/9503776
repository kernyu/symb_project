Between the end of November 1996 and the beginning of March 1997, there was an outbreak of Escherichia coli O26:H11 infection in Asahikawa. The strain produced only verotoxin type 1. The minimal inhibitory concentrations (microgram/ml) of the strain under aerobic condition and those of anaerobic were as follows: chloramphenicol (1.56, 0.78), minocycline (12.5, 3.13), kanamycin (3.13, 25), ampicillin (> 100, > 100), fosfomycin (12.5, 1.56), norfloxacin (0.1, 0.1), and cefaclor (6.25, 3.13). Forty-one episodes of antibiotic therapy to 32 children, who were treated in Asahikawa Kosei Hospital, Asahikawa Municipal Hospital, and Asahikawa Red Cross Hospital, were evaluated bacteriologically. In 26 episodes treated with fosfomycin, the pathogen from stools of 19 were eradicated, 4 were not eradicated, and 3 were isolated again within 2 weeks after the cessation of therapy. Eight episodes treated with norfloxacin and 5 episodes in kanamycin were all eradicated.
