The anti-recombinogenic substance (E)-5-(2-bromovinyl)-2'-deoxyuridine (BVDU) was tested for its ability to prevent adriamycin-induced mdr1 gene amplification and expression in mouse leukemia cells in vitro. F4-6 cells that were treated with stepwise enhanced doses of adriamycin acquired resistance against adriamycin. While 20 ng/ml adriamycin showed strong toxic effects in sensitive cells, the same dose was tolerated at the end of the long-term experiment following treatment with stepwise enhanced doses of adriamycin. In parallel experiments, 0.5 or 1 microg/ml BVDU was given together with adriamycin. BVDU prevented the formation of resistance against adriamycin treatment. Using differential PCR, the signal intensity of the mdr1a-specific band appeared markedly increased in adriamycin-resistant cells, while the signal intensities of the adriamycin + BVDU-treated cells resembled the intensity ratio of the untreated control cells. Beyond that, in resistant F4-6 cells increased expression of mdr genes was demonstrated by Northern blot analysis.
