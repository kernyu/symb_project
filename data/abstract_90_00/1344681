A study was carried out on 40 Mycobacterium fortuitum strains isolated from 39 symptomatic respiratory patients and 1 from a chronic skin ulcer, the susceptibility of whom to different antimicrobial agents was determined by the disk diffusion method. The strain showed sensitivity to aminoglucosides such as amikacin, gentamicin and kanamycin, and in all cases resistance to the penicillins ans cephalosporins used.
