The introduction of antibiotics heralded a new era in the chemotherapy of infectious diseases, but over the ensuing years bacterial evolutionary responses to the selective pressure of antibiotics have resulted in microorganisms resistant to virtually every known antibiotic. The consequences have been very important in clinical practice, as patients infected with a multi-resistant organism suffer increased morbidity and mortality and often require the use of expensive and potentially toxic antibiotic regimens in order to achieve effective, specific treatment.
