The emergence and dissemination of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) emphasizes the need for laboratories to be able to correctly detect them. The study described was conducted to evaluate the test methods presently available in Japan to discriminate between the isolates of VRE and those susceptible (VSE). Among the phenotypic test methods evaluated, an agar screening method which utilized 8 micrograms per ml of vancomycin in Mueller-Hinton agar plate appeared to have a sufficient accuracy. When 23 isolates of vanA positive, 31 of vanB positive, 4 of both positive and 60 of both negative were tested, the sensitivity and specificity to detect VRE were estimated to be 98.3% and 100%, respectively. Also, all the VRE isolates were interpreted as being resistant or intermediate by the E test recently approved in Japan, when the results were read after 48 hr-incubation. Whereas, two disk diffusion tests, Showa disk and NCCLS-based Sensi-disc, were evaluated, but both methods failed to discriminate between VRE and VSE, in particular, between the isolates with vanB positive and negative. The automated system, Vitek GPS-TA produced high frequencies of very major errors; 8.7% for vanA positives and 58% for vanB positives. A total of 1,214 enterococcal isolates from multisite laboratories in Japan, comprising 7 different species, were first tested onto agar screening test plates, but none of isolates represented phenotypic vancomycin resistance. With these results, it can be recommended to detect VRE in clinical microbiology laboratories as follows: First, all the enterococcal isolates will be tested onto the agar screening plates or by the E test. Then, if the isolate is interpreted as being resistant or intermediate, the laboratory should confirm whether it is positive for vanA or vanB by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) specified.
