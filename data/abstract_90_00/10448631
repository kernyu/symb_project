BACKGROUND: CMV retinitis is the most common manifestation of active CMV infection in patients with AIDS. Before ganciclovir became available, the prognosis of CMV retinitis was very poor. Meanwhile a number of strategies for the management of CMV retinitis have evolved. To date no antiviral agent has proved effective in preventing reactivation of retinitis. Therefore the available antiviral agents delay rather than prevent relapse of CMV retinitis. Each relapse produces a more serious disease and retinitis becomes progressively less manageable. METHOD: A review of current therapeutic strategies for the treatment of CMV retinitis with regard to the challenge of clinical resistance is given. CONCLUSION: Effective treatment of clinically resistant CMV retinitis must consider the individual conditions. Thus, it is probable, that integration of both local and systemic therapies may be required to reduce the frequency of reactivation and thereby to decelerate the progression of the disease.
