Adult female B6C3F1 mice were given a single ip dose of 0, 01, 1.0, or 10.0 micrograms/kg 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) and examined for immune function and host resistance 7-10 d later. Exposure to TCDD resulted in a significant dose-related decrease in induction of both IgM and IgG antibody-forming cells. This suppression was noted for both T-dependent and T-independent antigens. TCDD at a dosage of 10 micrograms/kg was shown to suppress production of antibody to viral hemagglutinin. In contrast, TCDD exposure had no significant effect on natural killer cell function, production of interferon, or various parameters of macrophage function. Assessment of host resistance revealed a significant increase in susceptibility to fatal infection with influenza virus, but no significant alteration in susceptibility to infection with the bacterium Listeria monocytogenes.
