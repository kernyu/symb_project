We evaluated the in vitro killing activities of ceftriaxone, imipenem, vancomycin, gentamicin, fosfomycin, and rifampin, alone and in combination, against 26 Streptococcus pneumoniae strains (penicillin G MICs, > 0.125 to 2 micrograms/ml) isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid of children with meningitis. The antibiotics were tested at clinically achievable concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid. After 5 h of incubation, imipenem was the most effective drug. None of the combinations had synergistic activity. Killing by beta-lactam antibiotics or vancomycin was enhanced by the addition of gentamicin, reduced by the addition of rifampin, and unaffected by the addition of fosfomycin.
