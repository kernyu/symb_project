This paper reports the results of 31P and 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies on the uptake and phosphorylation of 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (AZT) in the human CD4+ T-lymphoblastoid cell line CCRF-CEM (CEM-1.3) and in its AZT-resistant cell variant MT-500, isolated by prolonged culturing of CEM cells in the presence of increasing AZT concentrations. After 3 hr of incubation in the presence of 0.5 mM AZT, both AZT and its monophosphorylated form (AZT-MP) could be detected in the sensitive cell line in concentrations above the NMR detection levels. In another cell line, MOLT-4, which is less sensitive to AZT effects, the intracellular level of AZT-MP was much lower and was only slightly raised by increasing the concentration of AZT in the extracellular and intracellular compartments. In the AZT-resistant clone MT-500, characterized by a very low thymidine kinase (TK, EC 2.7.1.21) activity with respect to the parental clone, the intracellular AZT-MP concentration was below detection (<0.02 nmol/10(6) cells). Since, however, not only AZT-MP but also AZT signals failed to be detected in MT-500 extracts following cell incubation with AZT, it was concluded that a TK deficiency cannot be the exclusive mechanism of AZT resistance in these cells. The possible effects of additional mechanisms of drug resistance, such as specific AZT cell extrusion and limited permeation, are discussed, together with the new prospects offered by NMR spectroscopy to further evaluate the limiting steps for the utilization of antiretroviral nucleoside analogues.
