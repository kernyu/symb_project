This report summarizes the activities of quinupristin/dalfopristin (Q/D) and appropriate comparator antibiotics, including ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, gentamicin, rifampin, teicoplanin, and vancomycin, against selected gram-positive pathogens, including Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Streptococcus pyogenes. The study pathogens were obtained from 2 sources: (1) clinical isolates taken from patients participating in Q/D worldwide Phase III comparative and noncomparative (emergency-use program) clinical trials; and (2) other isolates collected from the laboratories of 45 geographically distinct medical centers around the world. Q/D was highly active, with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) < or = 1.0 microg/mL against most isolates, including those known to be resistant to methicillin, vancomycin, or erythromycin. Q/D was active (MICs < or = 1 microg/mL) against 95% of the vancomycin-resistant E. faecium strains, for example, whereas ciprofloxacin was active against 6%. Q/D was equally active against methicillin-susceptible or -resistant S. aureus strains (MIC90=1 microg/mL), as was vancomycin (MIC90=2 microg/mL), whereas ciprofloxacin was much less active against methicillin-resistant strains than against methicillin-susceptible strains (MIC90=32 vs 1 microg/mL). Given its spectrum of activity, Q/D may provide a viable option for the treatment of severe respiratory and skin and skin-structure infections caused by gram-positive bacteria, especially when strains with known or suspected resistance to other commonly used antibiotics are present.
