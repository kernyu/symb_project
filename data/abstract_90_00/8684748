OBJECTIVE: To determine the effects of the platelet-specific nitric oxide donor S-nitrosoglutathione on women with severe preeclampsia. METHODS: Ten women with severe preeclampsia or preeclampsia with severe fetal compromise at 21-33 weeks' gestation each received a 60-90-minute intravenous infusion of 50-250 micrograms/minute of S-nitrosoglutathione. Each was hypertensive, despite conventional oral antihypertensive therapy in eight. Maternal blood pressure, heart rate, platelet activation, uterine artery, and fetal Doppler indices were measured during the infusion. RESULTS: A dose-dependent reduction in mean arterial pressure from 125 mmHg (95% confidence interval [CI] 117-133) to 103.5 (95% CI 97-111) (P < .005) and an increase in pulse rate from 73.7 beats per minute (95% CI 64.3-84.5) to 89.1 (95% CI 81.2-97.8) (P < .02) was observed during the infusion. Mean uterine artery resistance index fell from 0.76 (95% CI 0.73-0.81) to 0.70 (95% CI 0.65-0.75) (P < .009). Platelet activation measured by P-selectin expression was reduced from 3.02% (95% CI 2.09-4.36) to 1.22% (95% CI 0.94-1.58) (P < .01). Fetal Doppler indices (umbilical artery, middle cerebral artery, and thoracic aorta) showed no significant changes during the infusion. CONCLUSION: S-nitrosoglutathione infusion reduced material mean arterial pressure, platelet activation, and uterine artery resistance without further compromising fetal Doppler indices. This study suggests that platelet-specific nitric oxide donors may prove beneficial in the management of severe preeclampsia.
