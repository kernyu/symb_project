This study was designed to provide baseline information on the sensitivity of 4 geographical isolates of Onchocerca volvulus microfilariae (mf) (Ghana forest, Ghana savanna, Cameroon forest and Guatemala) to ivermectin, and to develop an in vitro system with which to examine parasites for the possible development of drug resistance. Drug effects were best visualized in the presence of monkey kidney (LLCMK2) feeder cells in the culture system (MEM medium+20% serum), since mf maintained in the absence of cells declined in condition rapidly. Incubation of Ghana forest mf (+cells) in ivermectin (10(-5)-10(-10) M) caused a decrease in motility index (MI) scores in a concentration-dependent fashion; drug effects could be observed as early as 6 h, but cultures maintained for up to 8 d showed greater differences between control and drug groups with increasing time. All 4 O. volvulus isolates and O. lienalis (bovine) were compared for their response to ivermectin (10(-7) M): O. lienalis mf were significantly more sensitive (78%) reduction in MI scores on day 8) than the O. volvulus isolates (33.4-47.7% reduction). O. volvulus microfilariae ex utero generally displayed lower levels of motility and were slightly less inhibited by ivermectin than were skin mf. The in vitro system described can distinguish between the populations of mf studied on the basis of differing MI responses to ivermectin and, when combined with assays to test the infectivity of mf to blackflies following exposure to drug, will provide methods with which to examine parasites for the possible development of resistance.
