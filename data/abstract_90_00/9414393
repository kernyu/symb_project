Cryptophycin-8 was prepared by the conversion of the epoxide group on cryptophycin-1 to a chlorohydrin. In the studies reported here, cryptophycin-8 was evaluated for preclinical activity against subcutaneous tumors of both mouse and human origin. At the highest non-toxic single course treatment, the following results were obtained (Table A). Cryptophycin-8 was less potent than cryptophycin-1 by approximately 4-fold; however, it was both more water soluble and had greater therapeutic efficacy, as demonstrated by % T/C, tumor cell log kill values, range of dose effectiveness and host cures.
