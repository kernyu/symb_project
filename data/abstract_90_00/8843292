We have synthesized several 4-aminoquinolines with shortened side chains that retain activity against chloroquine-resistant isolates of Plasmodium falciparum malaria (W. Hofheinz, C. Jaquet, and S. Jolidon, European patent 94116281.0, June 1995). We report here an assessment of the activities of four selected compounds containing ethyl, propyl, and isopropyl side chains. Reasonable in vitro activity (50% inhibitory concentration, < 100 nM) against chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum strains was consistently observed, and the compounds performed well in a variety of plasmodium berghei animal models. However, some potential drawbacks of these compounds became evident upon in-depth testing. In vitro analysis of more than 70 isolates of P. falciparum and studies with a mouse in vivo model suggested a degree of cross-resistance with chloroquine. In addition, pharmacokinetic analysis demonstrated the formation of N-dealkylated metabolites of these compounds. These metabolites are similarly active against chloroquine-susceptible strains but are much less active against chloroquine-resistant strains. Thus, the clinical dosing required for these compounds would probably be greater for chloroquine-resistant strains than for chloroquine-susceptible strains. The clinical potential of these compounds is discussed within the context of chloroquine's low therapeutic ratio and toxicity.
