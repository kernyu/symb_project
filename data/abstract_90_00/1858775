The administration of 0.5 g (IM) of desferrioxamine every 12 hr for 3 days with 25 mg/kg (total dose for three days) of chloroquine abated the parasitemia of Plasmodium falciparum infected individuals more rapidly than chloroquine alone. Two patients with in vitro evidence of total or partial resistance to chloroquine also were successfully treated with the combination of drugs, and were free of parasitized red cells by day 7. Further clinical trials and development of desferrioxamine in the treatment of P. falciparum are warranted.
