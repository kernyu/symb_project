Nuclear DNA content was assessed in multidrug-resistant (MDR) cells by image and flow cytometry. Two human MDR cell lines (K562-Dox and CEM-VLB) obtained by in vitro drug selection and overexpressing mdr1 gene were compared to their respective sensitive counterparts (K562 and CCRF-CEM) and to the MDR hamster LR73-R cell line obtained by transfection of mouse mdr1 cDNA. Both cell lines obtained by selection displayed a decreased DNA content, as measured by image cytometry after Feulgen staining, or by flow cytometry after staining with propidium iodide, ethidium bromide, or Hoechst 33342. This decrease was not accompanied by changes in cell cycle phase distribution of cells. Moreover, image cytometry of cells stained after various hydrolysis times in 5 M HCl indicated that MDR cells displayed the same hydrolysis kinetics and sensitivity as drug-sensitive cells with a well-preserved stoichiometry of the Feulgen reaction. LR73-R cells transfected with mdr1 cDNA exhibited only a very limited change in propidium iodide staining as compared with sensitive LR73 cells, suggesting that mdr1 gene overexpression alone could not account for the alterations in DNA content observed in the selected MDR cells.
