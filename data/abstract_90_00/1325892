The chemistry, mechanism of action, antimicrobial spectrum, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, safety, drug interactions, and dosage and administration of lomefloxacin and temafloxacin, two new antimicrobials, are presented. Lomefloxacin and temafloxacin exhibit activity comparable to that of ciprofloxacin against the Enterobacteriaceae. Lomefloxacin has only modest activity against common gram-positive organisms. Temafloxacin exhibits increased activity against the streptococci and moderate activity against many anaerobes, as compared with ciprofloxacin. Lomefloxacin and temafloxacin have only moderate antipseudomonal activity. Their elimination half-lives are 6-10 hours and they have good oral absorption, excellent penetration into many tissues and fluids, and a better drug-interaction profile than other similar agents. Lomefloxacin has demonstrated comparable efficacy to other therapies in the treatment of lower respiratory-tract infections and urinary-tract infections (UTIs) and for prophylaxis before surgical procedures in the urinary tract. Temafloxacin has been shown to be effective in the treatment of lower respiratory-tract infections, infections of the skin and associated structures, uncomplicated and complicated UTIs, bacterial prostatitis, and gonococcal and non-gonococcal urethritis and cervicitis. The most frequent adverse effects with lomefloxacin are gastrointestinal upset and headache; with temafloxacin, gastrointestinal complaints. Lomefloxacin's dosage is 400 mg p.o. daily for 10 days for treatment of acute bacterial exacerbations in chronic bronchitis or simple cystitis and for 14 days for treatment of complicated UTIs. Lomefloxacin is a new oral fluoroquinolone that is indicated for the treatment of various bacterial infections. Temafloxacin, another new fluoroquinolone, appeared to have some favourable characteristics but was withdrawn from the market.
