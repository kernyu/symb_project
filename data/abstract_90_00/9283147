A 75-year-old female with diabetes mellitus, who was born and lived in West north Kyusyu, was admitted to our hospital, because of unconsciousness and loss of appetite. The physical examination showed neck stiffness and a high fever. The laboratory data showed accentuation of inflammatory reaction and azotemia and positive HTLV-1 antibody. The spinal fluid showed increase of cell count and amount of protein. A stool and sputum smear revealed rhabditis form larvae of the nematode. Antibiotics and ivermectin were administered for the bacterial meningitis and hyperinfection of the strongyloides, respectively. Consequently, meningitis and strongyloidiasis improved. It was considered that the patient was infected with strongyloides from her husband who serve in the army during World-War II, and hyperinfection of strongyloides resulted from the immunosuppressive state of diabetes mellitus. Ivermectin, and anti-strongyloides agent, was effective, and no side effects were seen. However, the therapeutic resistance in this case was associated with the positive HTLV-1 antibody.
