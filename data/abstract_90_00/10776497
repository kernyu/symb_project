A total of 983 patients samples (pus, urine, sputum, throat swabs, blood culture, CSF, vaginal swabs, ear swabs) were studied for a period of one year. The incidence of coagulase positive Staphylococci was highest in pus and the incidence of coagulase negative Staphylococci was highest in conjunctival swabs. Antibiotic Sensitivity pattern of routinely used antibiotics was studied. Coagulase positive Staphylococci was found to be most sensitive to Ciprofloxacin followed by Norfloxacin and Gentamycin. Coagulase negative Staphylococci showed maximum sensitivity to Ciprofloxacin followed by Norfloxacin and Chloramphenicol.
