A small plasmid of 4.4 kb encoding resistance to streptomycin (Smr) was detected in a multiresistant Staphylococcus hyicus culture from a piglet with exudative epidermitis. The plasmid-encoded properties were determined by interspecies protoplast transformation experiments. This plasmid was further characterised by restriction endonuclease analysis and a preliminary restriction map was constructed. The plasmid from S. hyicus that conferred streptomycin resistance was designated as pSAI-1. It showed some structural homology with the streptomycin-chloramphenicol resistance plasmid pSK68 from S. aureus of human origin. The MIC of streptomycin in resistance mediated by pSAI-1 was about 10 times higher than the MICs in resistance mediated by Smr plasmids from human S. aureus strains.
