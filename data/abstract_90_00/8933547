BACKGROUND: A vaccine for prevention of serogroup B meningococcal disease is not available in the United States, and indications for the use of mass chemoprophylaxis for control of meningococcal outbreaks are not well-defined. In response to an outbreak of six cases of enzyme type 5 serogroup B meningococcal disease among students at a middle school, we implemented a program of mass rifampin prophylaxis and evaluated the effectiveness of this preventive measure. METHODS: Oropharyngeal cultures were obtained from 351 of the 900 students before prophylaxis; 196 participants were recultured 3 weeks later. Meningococcal isolates were subtyped and tested for rifampin susceptibility, and risk factors for disease or carriage among students were evaluated. RESULTS: No cases occurred after prophylaxis. Before prophylaxis 10% (34 of 351) of students were meningococcal carriers and 3.4% (12 of 351) carried the epidemic strain. After prophylaxis 2.5% (5 of 196) were carriers and 1.0% (2 of 196) carried the epidemic strain. Rifampin was 85% effective in eradicating carriage, and the rate of acquisition of carriage during the 3-week period was low (0.5%). Carriage persisted after prophylaxis in 4 students; 3 of these postprophylaxis isolates were rifampin-resistant. Rifampin resistance thus developed in 12% (3 of 26) of preprophylaxis isolates. Disease/epidemic strain carriage was associated with enrollment in the school band and certain other classes. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggests that mass chemoprophylaxis may be effective and should be considered for control of school serogroup B meningococcal outbreaks. This approach is less likely to be effective for control of outbreaks affecting larger, less well-defined populations and is associated with the rapid development of antibiotic resistance.
