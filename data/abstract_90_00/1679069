Between 1959 and 1988, all Staphylococcus aureus strains (15 168 patients) isolated from blood in Denmark have been collected, investigated and stored, and clinical data has been obtained. Erythromycin resistance was found in 4.9% of these strains. The frequency of erythromycin resistance peaked at 25% in 1966, due to the spread in hospitals of multiresistant strains of the 83A complex. When these strains dominated, an increased mortality rate was seen in patients infected with erythromycin-resistant S. aureus. In contrast to most countries, erythromycin resistance in S. aureus declined to less than 5% in 1971, continued to fall to 1.3% in 1983, and has increased slowly to 2.4% in 1988. The decline was only due to a decrease of multiresistant strains. Erythromycin-resistant strains isolated in recent years are predominantly resistant only to penicillin and erythromycin and belong to many different phage type patterns. In Denmark, inducible resistance has occurred at a stable high frequency of approximately 90% of the erythromycin-resistant strains during the last 30 years. Erythromycin-resistant strains isolated today, however, have higher minimum inhibitory concentrations, and are rarely resistant to spectinomycin, in contrast to the strains isolated in the first half of the observation period.
