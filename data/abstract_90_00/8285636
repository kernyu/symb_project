The fluoroquinolone WIN 57273 showed identical bactericidal activities (MBC for 90% of the strains = 0.25 micrograms/ml) for bacteremic strains of Enterococcus faecalis with and without high-level gentamicin resistance. WIN 57273 was bactericidal in time-kill measurements with highly gentamicin-resistant, ciprofloxacin-susceptible strains of E. faecalis. However, WIN 57273 was indifferent with penicillin for gentamicin-resistant E. faecalis and was not bactericidal for ciprofloxacin-resistant E. faecalis.
