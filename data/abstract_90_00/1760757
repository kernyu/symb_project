For a given infection, each antibiotic will have a probability of producing a beneficial outcome. Decisions that increase the antibacterial activity of the therapeutic regimen against the bacterial infection will increase the probability of a beneficial outcome. Unfortunately, such decisions may increase the cost of therapy or the risks of toxicity. Finally, neonatal calves presented for therapy are not of uniform value. It is logical to employ different antimicrobial drugs and ancillary therapies when the value of the individual calf is considered. A constructive balance between efficacy, cost, and toxicity establishes the value of a therapeutic approach for the client.
