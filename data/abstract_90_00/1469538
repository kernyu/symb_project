The lipopeptide antimycotic agent, cilofungin, at a dose of 20 micrograms ml-1, inhibited beta 1-3 glucan synthesis in a drug-susceptible strain (3153; minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) < 1 microgram ml-1) as well as in a drug-resistant strain of Candida albicans (CA-2, derived from 3153 by nitrosoguanidine mutagenesis; MIC > 50 micrograms ml-1). This was demonstrated for both whole cells under growing and non-growing conditions, and during protoplast regeneration. However, time-effect experiments, during growth of a CA-2 culture initially exposed to an inhibitory dose of cilofungin, showed that this strain was able to progressively regain both glucan synthesis and a growth rate comparable to that of cultures that had not been treated with the drug. This recovery was not attributable to cilofungin instability or degradation within the CA-2 culture. Our study suggests the existence of an as yet unknown drug-related and/or cell-related factor(s) modulating the inhibition of glucan synthesis, and then contributing to the actual inhibitory effects of cilofungin in C. albicans.
