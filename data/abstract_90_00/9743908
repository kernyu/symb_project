An intramuscular preparation of imipenem/cilastatin (IPM/CS, 500 mg/500 mg) was administered to 59 patients with complicated urinary tract infections (UTI; cystitis and pyelonephritis) to evaluate its efficacy and safety. The obtained results are summarized as follows: In patients with cystitis, evaluations based on daily frequencies of administration were also performed. 1) According to the treating doctors, the drug showed an overall efficacy rate of 80% (45/56 patients). The efficacy rate was 89% in patients with cystitis treated by a u.i.d. regimen. Among patients treated by a b.i.d. regimen, the efficacy rate was 67% for cystitis cases and 84% for pyelonephritis cases. 2) When clinical efficacy was assessed according to the criteria for UTI drug efficacy evaluation, the drug was 'markedly effective' in 14 patients, 'effective' in 23, and ineffective in 11 patients, for an efficacy rate of 77% (37/48 patients). 3) The microbiological eradication rate was 88% (59/67 strains). The rate was 95% (20/21 strains) for Gram-positive bacteria and 85% (39/46 strains) for Gram-negative bacteria. The efficacy for Enterobacter faecalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was 100% and 73%, respectively. 4) As side effects, pain at the injection site was reported by one patient and abnormal laboratory test values were observed in 2 patients. All of these reactions were mild and resolved shortly after the completion of treatment. Based on these findings, it is concluded that this intramuscular preparation of IPM/CS is effective for treating complicated urinary tract infections.
