The novel 4(th) generation cephalosporin FK037 was in vitro compared to cefepime and cefpirome on 563 multiresistant nosocomial isolates including methicillin-susceptible (MSSA) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Their time-kill effect was studied on MSSA, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and isolates of Enterobacter cross-resistant to cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, and to ceftazidime, their interaction with amikacin being also evaluated on the latter isolates. Results revealed that FK037 possessed a superior antistaphylococcal activity on MSSA isolates to both other compounds being however equal active to cefepime and cefpirome on multiresistant enterobacteriaceae. Synergy was documented between 4(th) generation cephalosporins and amikacin on K. pneumoniae and on Enterobacter spp. cross-resistant to 3(rd) generation cephalosporins. In the latter species 4(th) generation cephalosporins remained inactive. The presented results support the need of clinical studies with FK037 as monotherapy for nosocomial infections based on the local surveillance data of the level of antimicrobial resistance of each hospital.
