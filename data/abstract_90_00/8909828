The objective of this study was to characterize the overgrowth and susceptibility of Enterococcus faecium, compared with that of other enterococci, in the feces of patients with hematologic malignancy. During a 52-week period, surveillance samples of feces were cultured weekly. Three hundred thirty-three samples were obtained from 92 patients. E. faecium outnumbered other enterococci in 170 (44%) of the samples, while the opposite was true in 119 (31%) of the samples. Fecal overgrowth of E. faecium (> or = 9.0 log10 cfu/g) was found in 62 samples (16%), while overgrowth of other enterococci was documented in 20 samples (5%) (P < .001). Treatment with third-generation cephalosporins preceded the overgrowth of E. faecium in 93% of the patients. Resistance of E. faecium isolates to ampicillin, high-level gentamicin, and vancomycin was detected in 41%, 4%, and 2% of the patients, respectively. There were 6 patients with enterococcal bacteremia (due to E. faecium in 5 and Enterococcus faecalis in 1) during the study period. The high prevalence of resistance to ampicillin and imipenem rendered few (if any) intravenous antibiotics able to prevent fecal overgrowth of E. faecium.
