BACKGROUND: Empirical treatment of pneumococcal upper and lower respiratory infections must be chosen on the basis of the susceptibility patterns of nasopharyngeal colonizing strains isolated from healthy carriers. METHODS: The susceptibility to erythromycin and clarithromycin was investigated by a conventional microdilution method among 103 pneumococci isolates recovered from healthy children (n = 63) and adults (n = 40) exhibiting decreased susceptibility to penicillin (MIC > or = 0.12 mg/l). RESULTS: 63% of penicillin -resistant pediatric isolates were susceptible to erythromycin and 78.9% were susceptible to clarithromycin . Among isolates with diminished susceptibility to penicillin , 77.7% were susceptible to erythromycin and 86.3% to clarithromycin . 90% of adult isolates were susceptible to erythromycin and to clarithromycin . Overall, clarithromycin exhibited a better activity than erythromycin . CONCLUSIONS: Clarithromycin , and to a lesser extent erythromycin , are good alternatives to penicillin in the empirical treatment of respiratory tract infections caused by pneumococci with diminished susceptibility to penicillin .
