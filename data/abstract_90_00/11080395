The final sigma 54 factor has been previously described to be involved in Listeria monocytogenes sensitivity to mesentericin Y105, a subclass IIa bacteriocin. Here, we identified the rpoN gene, encoding final sigma 54, of Enterococcus faecalis JH2-2 and showed that its interruption leads to E. faecalis resistance to different subclass IIa bacteriocins. Moreover, this rpoN mutant remained sensitive to nisin, a class I bacteriocin, suggesting that final sigma 54 is especially involved in sensitivity to subclass IIa bacteriocins.
