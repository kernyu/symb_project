The combination of ampicillin plus arbekacin produced synergistic killing against 8 of 13 vancomycin-, ampicillin-, gentamicin-, and streptomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium isolates that possess the high-level gentamicin resistance gene, aph(2")-Id. This combination may prove useful in treating infections caused by multiresistant enterococci.
