The results of mastitis bacteriology made by the National Veterinary and Food Research Institute in Finland during the past 50 years (1.15 million samples) are viewed in relation to simultaneous changes in dairy cow management. Although intensive preventive measures have been applied for decades, the prevalence of bovine mastitis has not decreased. Instead, pathogenic bacteria are becoming progressively less susceptible to the available therapy. In part this must be due to the emergence of antibiotic resistant strains of bacteria, but it seems that the bacterial spectrum has also changed. The incidence of Streptococcus agalactiae (group B streptococci) has decreased, while in contrast, the incidence of staphylococci, initially Staphylococcus aureus and later coagulase-negative staphylococci, has increased. Results suggest that external pressure, like changes in animal husbandry, including antimicrobial treatments and introduction of modern milking machines, act as selective forces on the bacterial species which cause bovine mastitis.
