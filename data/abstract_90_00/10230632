A preliminary exploration of analogues of 4,5-bis(3,5-dichlorophenyl)-2-trifluoromethyl-1H-imidazole, 1, as novel antibacterial agents was carried out to determine the basic features of the structure responsible for the observed biological activity. The presence of two aryl rings, the imidazole NH and either a good electron withdrawing group or an aldehyde or amino group at C-2 were required for good levels of activity against methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).
