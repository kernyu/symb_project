Newly hatched chickens are highly susceptible to infection during the first 2 weeks of life. The utilisation of cytokines as therapeutic agents in livestock animals, in particular poultry, has become more feasible with the recent cloning of cytokine genes and the progression of new technologies such as live vectors. We have constructed a live recombinant fowlpox virus (FPV) that expresses chicken myelomonocytic growth factor (fp/cMGF). Administration of fp/cMGF to chicks resulted in a marked and sustained increase in the number of circulating blood monocytes as well as an increase in their state of activation, as measured by enhanced phagocytic activity and elevated production of nitric oxide. We have recently cloned the gene for chicken interferon-gamma (ChIFN-gamma). Recombinant ChIFN-gamma was capable of protecting chick fibroblasts from undergoing virus-mediated lysis and induced nitrite secretion from chicken macrophages in vitro. Preliminary vaccination trials have indicated that co-administration of ChIFN-gamma with antigen (sheep red blood cells) resulted in enhanced secondary (IgG) antibody responses and allowed a 10-fold lower dose of antigen to be used. Furthermore, administration of ChIFN-gamma resulted in enhanced weight gain in chicks and improved their resistance to disease challenge. The ability of cytokines to combat infection and enhance vaccine efficacy makes them excellent candidates as a therapeutic agents and adjuvants.
