The anthelmintic efficacy of benzimidazoles, levamisole, rafoxanide and ivermectin was evaluated on an institutional farm in Kenya using faecal egg count reduction test, larval cultures and a controlled slaughter trial. The results of this study indicated simultaneous resistance of Haemonchus contortus against benzimidazoles, levamisole and rafoxanide and Trichostrongylus columbriformis and Oesophagostomum sp. against levamisole on the same farm. Injectable and orally administered ivermectin was effective against the benzimidazole and levamisole resistant H. contortus.
