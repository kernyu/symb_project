Reports of 1- to 2-log higher gene transfer levels in purified CD34+ cells or marrow CFU compared with levels in mature circulating blood cells after transplantation of retrovirally transduced primitive human hematopoietic cells have resulted in concern that transduced progenitors do not contribute proportionally to ongoing hematopoiesis (Kohn et al., 1995; Brenner, 1996). To study the issue in a relevant large animal, we analyzed samples of mature blood cells, marrow CD34-enriched cells and marrow CD34-depleted cells, and marrow CFU from a cohort of 11 rhesus transplanted with retrovirally transduced cells and followed for up to 5.5 years. They were transplanted with CD34-enriched bone marrow (BM) or G-CSF/SCF-mobilized peripheral blood (PB) cells transduced with vectors containing either neo, human glucocerebrosidase, or murine adenosine deaminase genes. There were no significant differences between the levels of vector sequences found in BM CD34+ cells, BM CD34- cells, PB granulocytes, or PB mononuclear cells (MNCs) in any animal. In four animals transplanted with SCF/G-CSF-primed BM cells and analyzed 3-6 months posttransplantation, the percentage of CFU containing the neo vector appeared to be 1 log higher than the representation of marked cells in the PB of these animals, but this discrepancy did not persist at time points greater than 6 months posttransplantation. The level of CFU marking was no higher than PB granulocyte or MNC marking at any time points in the other animals. Low levels of mature gene-modified cells probably reflect poor transduction of repopulating stem cells, not a block in differentiation or specific immune rejection of mature cells. This study represents the longest follow-up of primates transplanted with transduced hematopoietic cells, and it is encouraging that the levels of vector-containing cells appear stable for up to 5 years.
