Ciprofloxacin is a fluoroquinolone antimicrobial agent inhibiting bacterial DNA gyrase, with good in vitro and in vivo activity against many Gram-positive and Gram-negative ocular pathogens. It has low toxicity, low resistance rate and low minimum inhibitory concentration. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of ciprofloxacin in treating bacterial keratitis refractory to conventional therapy. Thirty patients with smear-proven bacterial ulcers were treated by conventional therapy. Of these, cultures were positive in 28 (93.3%) patients. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated in 13 (46.4%) patients, nontuberculous mycobacteria in nine (32.1%) and other bacteria in six (21.4%). Fifteen patients (50%) were cured with conventional therapy. Four patients (13.3%) underwent surgery due to impending corneal perforation. Eleven patients were shifted to ciprofloxacin therapy because of poor results with conventional treatment. Of these, eight (72.7%) patients were treated successfully. No adverse events were encountered except a white crystalline precipitate in two cases which resolved spontaneously after discontinuation of therapy. In view of its effectiveness and low toxicity, ciprofloxacin should be considered in treating bacterial keratitis which is refractory to conventional therapy.
