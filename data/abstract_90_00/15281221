The exposure of mammalian cells or tumors for weeks or months to low nonlethal doses of cytostatic drugs may induce multidrug resistance, which can be enhanced by a variety of DNA-damaging agents. Multidrug resistance to a variety of drugs has been observed. But in yeast, DNA-damaging agents have not yet been tested. As the appearance of resistance is the result of longterm exposure, we decided to extend the application of test substances to a period of up to 400 days. In such long-term experiments S. cerevisiae MP1 adapted to treatment with low doses of mutagens. Consistent results were obtained for both genotoxic and nongenotoxic carcinogenic substances, which implies that there may be a single pathway for carcinogens with different modes of action.
