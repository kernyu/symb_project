Sensitivity of 184 strains of four Preudomonas species that are of importance from the medical viewpoint was studied. It was shown that all the studied strains were resistant to cefazolin and ampicillin. Sulfomonomethoxine was active only against P. mallei. Gentamicin inhibited the growth of all the strains of P. mallei and 60 per cent of the strains of P. aeruginosa. Among the four studied strains, the causative agent of glanders was the least resistant to the chemotherapeutic drugs. Eleven out of the 16 studied drugs were active against P. mallei. The strains of P. pseudomallei, the organism causing melioidosis were sensitive to 6 drugs: ceftazidime, imipenem, doxycycline, minocycline, chloramphenicol and biseptol. The dime, ceftriaxone, cefsulodin, cefoperazone, cefotaxime, piperacillin and imipenem. The strains of P. cepacia were the most resistant to all the chemotherapeutic drugs studied and only biseptol was active in the concentrations attained in blood of patients (MIC50 12.5 mg/l). 10 to 70 per cent of the strains were sensitive to ceftazidime, imipenem, doxycycline, minocycline and rifampicin. Therefore, imipenem and ceftazidime were the most active drugs with respect to the causative agents of pseudomonoses. Biseptol, doxycycline and minocycline are also worthy note.
