The in-vitro activity of nisin, a 34-residue peptide produced by several Lactococcus lactis strains, and ranalexin, a 20-residue peptide isolated from the skin of the bullfrog Rana catesbeiana, alone and in combination with amoxycillin, amoxycillin-clavulanate, imipenem, clarithromycin, ciprofloxacin, rifampin and vancomycin was investigated against 40 nosocomial isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). All isolates were inhibited at concentrations of 1 to 32 microg/ml. Synergy was observed when the peptides were combined with other agents, with the exception of the beta-lactams. Finally, the consecutive exposures to each peptide did not result in selection of stable mutants with decreased susceptibility. Our finding show that nisin and ranalexin are active against MRSA, and that their activity is enhanced when they are combined with several antimicrobial agents.
