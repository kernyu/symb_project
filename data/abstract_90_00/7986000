An open, randomized comparison of ofloxacin (200 mg, every 12 h) given orally for 5 days and ceftriaxone (3 g, once daily) given intravenously for 3 days in the treatment of uncomplicated enteric fever was conducted in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. Salmonella paratyphi type A was isolated from six patients. Salmonella typhi was isolated from 41 patients; 63% of these isolates were resistant to multiple antibiotics: ampicillin, chloramphenicol, sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, and tetracycline. Of the culture-confirmed cases, treatment with ofloxacin resulted in complete cure of all 22 patients, whereas 18 of 25 patients treated with ceftriaxone were completely cured (P < 0.01). In the ceftriaxone group, there were six acute treatment failures and one relapse. Mean +/- standard deviation fever clearance times were 81 +/- 25 h for ofloxacin and 196 +/- 87 h for ceftriaxone (P < 0.0001). Short-course treatment with oral ofloxacin (5 days) is significantly better than that with ceftriaxone (3 days) and will be of particular benefit in areas where multiresistant strains of S. typhi are encountered.
