A novel gene, drp35, of Staphylococcus aureus, which was inducible especially with cell wall-affecting antibiotics, has been cloned. Analysis of differential hybridization with mRNAs enhanced in the presence of beta-lactams resulted in two positive clones that harbored a new gene encoding a 35,845-Da protein (Drp35) and the penicillin-binding protein 2 (PBP2). Immunoblot analysis revealed that the Drp35 protein band was evidently enhanced after 30 min in the presence of beta-lactams. The Drp35 expression was also enhanced with not only beta-lactams, but also vancomycin, bacitracin, and fosfomycin. Homology search revealed that Drp35 was a new protein. Our results revealed that it was specific in S. aureus and respondent to these agents in both methicillin-resistant and -sensitive strains of S. aureus.
