The medical records of 48 patients with culture-positive streptococcal endophthalmitis diagnosed between January 1977 and May 1990 were reviewed. The viridans group streptococci were isolated in 24 (50%) of the 48 cases, enterococci in 13 cases (27.1%), Streptococcus pneumoniae in six cases (12.5%), and beta-hemolytic streptococci in six (12.5%) of 48 cases. The clinical statuses of endophthalmitis cases by etiology were postoperative in 40 patients (83.3%), posttraumatic in six patients (12.5%), and miscellaneous in two patients (4.2%). Overall, 15 (31.2%) patients achieved 20/400 or better visual acuity. The streptococcal isolates demonstrated a 32.6% in vitro resistance to gentamicin sulfate, whereas all isolates were sensitive to vancomycin hydrochloride. The enterococci were often resistant to the cephalosporins, whereas the other streptococcal species were not.
