A-factor, 2-(6'-methylheptanoyl)-3R-hydroxymethyl-4-butanolide, is an autoregulator essential for streptomycin production and sporulation in Streptomyces griseus. S. griseus 2247 that requires no A-factor for streptomycin production or sporulation was found to have a defect in the A-factor-binding protein. This observation implied that the A-factor-binding protein in the absence of A-factor repressed the expression of both phenotypes in the wild-type strain. Screening among mutagenized S. griseus colonies for strains producing streptomycin and sporulating in the absence of A-factor yielded three mutants that were also deficient in the A-factor-binding protein. Reversal of the defect in the A-factor-binding protein of these mutants led to the simultaneous loss of streptomycin production and sporulation. These data suggested that the A-factor-binding protein played a role in repressing both streptomycin production and sporulation and that the binding of A-factor to the protein released its repression. Mutants deficient in the A-factor-binding protein began to produce streptomycin and sporulate at an earlier stage of growth than did the wild-type strain. These mutants produced approximately 10 times more streptomycin than did the parental strain. These findings are consistent with the idea that the intracellular concentration of A-factor determines the timing of derepression of the gene(s) whose expression is repressed by the A-factor-binding protein.
