Zalcitabine (ddC) is a nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitor with demonstrated clinical benefit in combination use. More widespread use of zalcitabine has been limited by a number of factors including peripheral neuropathy and three times daily dosing. However, screening for the risk factors for peripheral neuropathy may enable a reduction in the incidence of neuropathy to below 10%. Additionally, new data on the use of zalcitabine twice daily suggest, based on the long intracellular half-life of the active triphosphate, that this is feasible. Additionally, while limited data exist for zalcitabine in true HAART combinations, data from small trials suggest a similar proportion of responders to standard HAART regimens.
