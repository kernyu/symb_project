1. The ability of cell-free preparations from bovine lens to degrade fragments of alpha-crystallin has been studied. Crystallin fragments, produced by either chemical cleavage with cyanogen bromide or prolonged treatment with H2O2 and Cu2+ to produce hydroxyl radicals, were labelled with 125I and incubated with preparations obtained from lenses from animals of different age. 2. Results showed that the ability of the preparations obtained from the lens cores (the innermost part of the lens composed of enucleated non-dividing cells incapable of protein synthesis) to degrade crystallin fragments decreased with animal age. No such age-related correlation was obtained with preparations obtained from the cortex (the outer region of the lens surrounding the core). 3. The effect of incubation of the various lenticular preparations with H2O2 and Cu2+ on subsequent ability to catabolise crystallin fragments was also examined. Preparations from the oldest lenses were found to be the least resistant to free-radical attack. 4. The relative susceptibility of the crystallins and non-lenticular proteins to H2O2/Cu(2+)-mediated free-radical attack was examined. Not only were the various crystallins (alpha, beta and gamma) far more resistant to cleavage under these conditions, they also protected the non-lenticular proteins from free-radical-mediated attack. The comparative resistance of the crystallins to attack and their ability to protect other proteins appeared to be dependent on their structural integrity as prior denaturation with acid and/or cleavage with cyanogen bromide eliminated these properties. 5. It is suggested that crystallins (which show sequence homology to some heat-shock proteins) possess homeostatic functions which could protect other proteins (e.g. proteases) from certain forms of free-radical-mediated damage; crystallins may therefore be important in ageing in general where aberrant polypeptides accumulate.
