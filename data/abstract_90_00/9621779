Infections with multiresistant tubercle bacilli have also become a problem in the rich part of the world. The reasons are lack of compliance in patients with life style problems and ineffectiveness of the health system due to lack of fundings. During a four year period, 1993-1996 ten patients were seen in Denmark with tuberculosis due to multiresistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Nine were infected abroad, one developed MDR-TB during treatment in Denmark. It is possible to cure these patients, but it is expensive and takes a long time. In the future more cases created within Denmark are likely to be seen due to lack of funding for the tuberculosis programme and, depending on immigration, further cases created abroad are expected.
