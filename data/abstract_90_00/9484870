The in-vitro activity of grepafloxacin was compared with that of other antimicrobials against respiratory tract pathogens collected from 15 UK laboratories over the winter of 1995-96. Penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae was not encountered, but macrolide resistance was seen in approximately 10% of strains. Grepafloxacin (MIC90 0.25 mg/L) was four- to eight-fold more active than ciprofloxacin. Twelve percent of Haemophilus influenzae were beta-lactamase producers, macrolides were relatively inactive yet fluoroquinolones were highly active. Moraxella catarrhalis were highly susceptible to fluoroquinolones and macrolides. The activity of grepafloxacin against respiratory tract pathogens should make it a useful agent in the treatment of infections at this site.
