The analysis of gel banding patterns of penicillin-binding proteins was used to identify two clinical isolates of a coagulase-negative Staphylococcus species as Staphylococcus caprae, a species originally isolated from goat's milk. One of the isolates was further shown to carry mecA, the structural gene for methicillin resistance.
