Using 14 monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) in solid-phase ELISA it was found that influenza virus A/Hong Kong/1/68 (H3N2) mutants resistant to the antiviral compound mopyridone as compared to the mopyridone-sensitive mutant manifested significant changes in the antigenic structure (sites 1A, 2 and 3) of M1 protein. No differences in M1 were found between rimantadine-resistant and rimantadine-sensitive mutants of influenza virus A(H3N2).
