Foscarnet and ganciclovir appear to be of similar effectiveness in halting active infection when given as induction therapy and in forestalling progression of disease when given as maintenance therapy in persons with AIDS who have cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis. The primary dose-limiting toxicity of foscarnet is nephrotoxicity, whereas that of ganciclovir is neutropenia. The availability of two effective agents with different toxicities permits selection of initial treatment for CMV retinitis based on individual patient characteristics and provides an alternative for therapy if drug intolerance or viral resistance develops. An approach to treatment of first-episode and recurrent CMV retinitis based on patient and drug characteristics is presented. Case reports detailing the use of foscarnet and ganciclovir and problems encountered in patient management are discussed.
