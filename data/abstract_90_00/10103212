The in vitro activities of 13 fluoroquinolones (FQs) were tested against 90 Staphylococcus aureus clinical isolates: 30 wild type for gyrA, gyrB, grlA and norA and 60 with mutations in these genes. Clinafloxacin (CI-960), sparfloxacin, and grepafloxacin were the most active FQs against wild-type isolates (MICs at which 90% of isolates were inhibited, 0.06 to 0.1 microgram/ml). Mutations in grlA did not affect the MICs of newer FQs. grlA-gyrA double mutations led to higher MICs for all the FQs tested. Efflux mechanisms affected the newer FQs to a much lesser extent than the less recently developed FQs.
