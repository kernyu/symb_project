Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) produces two polyproteins, Pr55(Gag) and Pr160(Gag-Pol), that are cleaved into mature functional subunits by the virally encoded protease. Drugs that inhibit this protease are an important part of anti-HIV therapy. We studied the ordered accumulation of Gag and Gag-Pol processing intermediates by variably blocking the protease with HIV-1 protease inhibitors (PIs). Variable protease inhibition caused accumulation of a complex pattern of processing intermediates, which was the same after incubating HIV-1-infected cells with increasing concentrations of either one of the peptidomimetic inhibitors indinavir, saquinavir (SQV), ritonavir (RTV), nelfinavir, and SC-52151 or one of the nonpeptidomimetic inhibitors DMP450, DMP323, PNU-140135, and PNU-109112 for 3 days. The patterns of Gag and Gag-Pol processing intermediate accumulation were nearly identical when the following were compared: cell- versus virion-associated proteins, HIV-1-infected transformed cell lines versus primary human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and HIV-1(MN) versus HIV-1(IIIB) virus strains. RTV was a more potent inhibitor of p24 production in PBMCs than SQV by approximately 7-fold, whereas SQV was a more potent inhibitor in transformed cells than RTV by approximately 30-fold. Although the antiretroviral potency of HIV-1 PIs may change as a function of cell type, the polyprotein intermediates that accumulate with increasing drug concentrations are the same. These results support sequential processing of Gag and Gag-Pol polyproteins by the HIV-1 protease and may have important implications for understanding common cross-resistance pathways.
