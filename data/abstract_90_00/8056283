An energy-dependent efflux system for ethidium and related cations has been detected in Enterococcus hirae ATCC 9790. The system was partially expressed when the organism was grown on a complex medium but was induced by the addition of phosphonium ions and related compounds. Mutants showing constitutive expression of the efflux system have been isolated on the basis of increased resistance to ethidium.
