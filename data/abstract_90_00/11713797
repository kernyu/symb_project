Inhibition of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) replication by oligonucleotides is a complex process and may be implemented by an array of antiviral mechanisms. These include inhibition of virus adsorption to the host cell, inhibition of transcription via antisense or as the result of triple helix formation, and inhibition of viral encoded enzymes such as reverse transcriptase and integrase. Since the particular mechanism of HIV inhibition depends on the oligonucleotide (ON) sequence and the ON chemical modifications, the design and synthesis of potent HIV inhibitors has been an important and rewarding focus of ON research. In this era of great concern that HIV may rapidly display resistance to any antiviral compound with one mechanism of viral inhibition, oligonucleotides are potentially attractive alternatives for therapy. Several ONs have entered clinical evaluation in AIDS patients. At present Zintevir, which inhibits both HIV adsorption and HIV integrase, is in phase I/II clinical trials.
