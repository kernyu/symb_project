We have compared the effect of alpha 2-C and gamma recombinant interferons (rIFNs) on normal myeloid progenitors (N-CFU-GM), chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) progenitors (CML-CFU-GM) and leukemic progenitors (L-CFU) of acute non-lymphoblastic leukemia (ANLL) patients. Within 14 days of continuous exposure in culture, a dose-dependent inhibition of CFU-GM was seen for most normal subjects. Resistance to rIFNs was frequent in leukemic patients and even more in acute leukemia than in CML. Stimulation of clonogenic cell growth was seen for a minority of leukemic patients. When only the sensitive cases were considered, no difference in sensitivity was noticed between normal, CML and ANLL patients. A good correlation was observed between the activity or the lack of activity of alpha and gamma rIFNs.
