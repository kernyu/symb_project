This study in 12 cancer treatment centres across the United States was designed to evaluate the potential for increased resistance to amikacin with unrestricted use. An initial 3-month baseline period during which the use of amikacin was restricted and that of tobramycin and gentamicin unrestricted was followed by a period of at least 12 months when amikacin was the primary aminoglycoside. Resistance of Gram-negative bacilli to these aminoglycosides from hospitalized patients was monitored and compared for the two periods. Amikacin usage increased from a mean of 20.1% to a mean of 83.9% of aminoglycoside patient-days. A reduction in the use of tobramycin and gentamicin were observed with means of 66.1 and 10%, and 13.9 and 6.1%, respectively for the two periods. Resistance to amikacin was 0.85% at baseline and 1.3% at end-point which was not clinically significant (P = 0.614). Baseline resistance was 6.5 and 7.6%, while final resistance was 2.6 and 4.8%, respectively for tobramycin (P = 0.001) and gentamicin (P = 0.052).
