PURPOSE: To compare the effect of a dentifrice containing 0.3% triclosan and 1100 ppm fluoride and a control dentifrice containing 1100 ppm fluoride on plaque, gingiva and the oral microflora in a long-term study simulating clinical usage. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 159 subjects entered the clinical study and 80 were randomly selected to participate in the microbiological evaluation. 71 subjects completed the detailed evaluation of the oral microflora after 6 months use. Plaque was collected at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months, and examined by darkfield microscopy, Gram stain, immunofluorescence, and selective and non-selective media. Changes in antimicrobial susceptibilities were determined for the first 6-month period and for 6 months post-therapy for 68 subjects who completed the entire study. Susceptibilities of whole plaque samples and MIC values for two pre-designated common plaque organisms, A. viscosus and V. parvula were performed. RESULTS: Multivariate ANOVA and non-parametric analyses revealed no statistical differences for any factor tested. No detrimental shifts were found in either; (1) the compositional make up of the normal flora, (2) the periodontopathic or cariogenic flora, or (3) the opportunistic flora in either group of dentifrice users. Both treatments resulted in decreases in Gram positive cocci over time. There was a reduction in spirochetes in the triclosan/fluoride group as compared to the control group. No overgrowth in opportunists, periodontal pathogens, or cariogenic flora was found in either group. No increase in the proportion of the whole plaque flora resistant to triclosan was found nor was an increase in the MIC values of either A. viscosus or V. parvula in either group. Overall, there appeared to be a general decrease in plaque bacteria in both groups over the course of the experiment.
