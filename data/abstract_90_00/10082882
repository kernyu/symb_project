Hair cell loss and a non-functional epithelial reorganization appeared in the organ of Corti after acoustic or toxic damage. Moreover, in the drug damaged organ of Corti, transient atypical cells were recently described with characteristics of both immature hair cells and/or non-sensory epithelial cells. The phenotype of these atypical cells has been now investigated by using the galectine 1 (GAL-1) antibody. In the normal organ of Corti, this antibody recognizes all the epithelial cells except the sensory hair cells and their supporting cells. At PD 21, transient atypical cells were not stained by GAL-1 antibody, suggesting that they were originated from hair cells or their supporting cells. Later, the organ of Corti was substituted by an epithelial scare, GAL-1 stained. This study also emphasizes the particular resistance of the cochlear apex to degeneration after antibiotic intoxication.
