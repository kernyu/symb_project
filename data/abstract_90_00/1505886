Development of resistance to ivermectin in vitro is reported for the first time. Two strains of Caenorhabditis elegans D5 and D6 able to grow on agar plates after treating with up to 3 mg ivermectin per L were selected. The parent strain N2 was extremely sensitive to ivermectin, its growth being inhibited by treatment with 0.1-0.2 mg IVM per L.
