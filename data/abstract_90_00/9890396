Alcohol intake is often followed by coffee drinking because of the universal acceptance of its sobering effect. Such effects were found inconsistent on motor functions. However, it is common belief that caffeine will antagonize the intoxicating effects of alcohol. The independent actions of caffeine and alcohol are well documented, but combined effects of short-term administration are unknown. This experimental work was designed to study the effects due to short-term administration of caffeine and alcohol on the cardiovascular system. In phase I, 30 experiments were performed in our laboratories to study the dose-response curves of both the drugs. In phases II and III, 15 dogs were subjected to 30 experiments. In phase II, caffeine, 5 mg/kg, was given i.v., followed by ethanol, 400 mg/kg i.v., and in phase III, sequence of drug administration was reversed to study the effects on hemodynamics and coronary artery blood flow. Caffeine did not show significant changes in all the cardiovascular parameters, and ethanol administration caused nonsignificant increase in heart rate, mean arterial pressure, left ventricular systolic pressure, and left ventricular (LV) mechanical work and decrease in the maximal rate of first derivative of LV pressure, stroke volume, and systemic vascular resistance. Left ventricular end-diastolic, pulmonary artery mean and right atrial pressures, pulmonary vascular resistance, myocardial oxygen consumption, and as coronary flow reserve increased as compared with controls. Combined caffeine and alcohol had synergistic effects, but when the order of drug administration was reversed (i.e., alcohol was followed by caffeine), the effect was antagonistic.
