Chloroquine resistance of Plasmodium falciparum first and of P. vivax more recently, stimulated the search for new antimalarics. Chinese investigators have introduced new compounds obtained from extracts of Artemisia annua which possess an antimalaric active principle different from those of the drugs in use. In Mexico eight species of Artemisia have been described and among them just A. ludoviciana has been empirically used in the treatment of intermittent fever. To know whether mexican Artemisia had antimalaric activity several in vivo experiments were performed. Different type of extracts from two Artemisia species were prepared and assayed in five different doses on mice infected by Plasmodium yoelii yoelii, in a four-day test scheme. Here, only the results of the assays on ethanolic extract of A. ludoviciana are presented. The results of the in vivo experiments showed that the parasite reproduction was inhibited up to 98.6% at the fifth day, as compared with the controls; the ED50 was of 29.2 mg/kg and the SM50 of 28.7. We looked after the presence of artemisinin in the ethanolic extract, without success.
