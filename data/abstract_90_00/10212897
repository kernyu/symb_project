Since 1994, the combination of mefloquine and artesunate is the standard treatment for uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria in the population of displaced persons on the Western border of Thailand. As a result, the fall of mefloquine efficacy was stopped and the incidence of falciparum malaria reduced. This is attributed to the effects of the artemisinin derivatives on transmissibility. Similar trends were observed in Vietnam where artemisinin is widely used. Combination therapies that include an artemisinin derivative could have a major role in the control of malaria and the spread of drug resistance.
