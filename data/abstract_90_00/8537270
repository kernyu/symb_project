The in-vitro activities of two glycylcyclines, DMG-MINO and DMG-DMDOT, and several comparative agents were determined against 263 enterococci, 102 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and 55 Streptococcus pneumoniae recent clinical isolates. The glycylcyclines and teicoplanin were the most active agents against the enterococcal isolates. All methicillin-resistant S. aureus were susceptible to the glycylcyclines. Only DMG-DMDOT, ciprofloxacin, teicoplanin and vancomycin exhibited comparable activity against penicillin-susceptible, -intermediate and -resistant S. pneumoniae strains.
