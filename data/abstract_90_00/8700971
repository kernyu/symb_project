The genetic relationship of a group of copper (Cur) and streptomycin (Smr) resistance plasmids and their Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae hosts was examined. Each of these plasmids contained sequences homologous to the oriV and par sequences from pOSU900, a cryptic P. syringae pv. syringae plasmid. Analysis of restriction digest patterns of plasmid DNA indicated that the plasmids could be clustered into four groups; two of the groups contained multiple members which differed by only a few fragments. An analysis of the host P. syringae genotypes using the arbitrarily primed PCR technique and genomic DNA indicated that the host strains could be placed in groups similar to those resulting from analysis of plasmid DNA. Southern hybridization analyses of plasmid DNA indicated that each Smr plasmid contained sequences homologous to probes specific for the strA-strB Smr genes and the transposase and resolvase genes from Tn5393. All plasmids hybridized to two additional probes derived from P. syringae plasmid DNA, but none of the plasmids contained IS51 or IS801 sequences. Furthermore, Tn5393 was mobilized, presumably by transposition, between the incompatible plasmids pPSR5 and pPSR4 in P. syringae pv. syringae FF5. The variation in molecular structure of the closely related plasmids in this study is similar to that observed with antibiotic-resistance plasmids from clinical bacteria.
