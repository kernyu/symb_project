The pathophysiological impact of infections with chloroquine-susceptible (CQS) and chloroquine-resistant (CQR) strains of Plasmodium berghei in Mastomys natalensis was studied with respect to changes in polyamine profiles in various tissues. Both CQS and CQR infections produced similar changes in polyamine profiles of various tissues. Maximum increase was recorded in spleen followed by liver and lungs. Renal, cardiac and cerebral tissues did not register significant changes. An increase in spermidine level was more prominent as compared to putrescine and spermine, leading to an overall increase in spermidine/spermine ratio. This ratio is an important index of cellular proliferation. Liver did not show considerable change in the activities of ornithine decarboxylase and S-adenosyl methionine decarboxylase, the regulatory enzymes of the polyamine biosynthetic pathway. Spleen however, registered marked induction of both the enzymes which was more prominent in the CQS infection than CQR. Normal erythrocytes contained traces of polyamine while the erythrocytes loaded with P. berghei parasites exhibited appreciably higher polyamine levels. Spermidine was detected in about five-fold higher concentrations than putrescine and spermine which were detected in equimolar levels. Again, CQS as well as CQR P. berghei, exhibited qualitatively and quantitatively similar polyamine profiles thus ruling out a role of polyamines in CQ-resistance in malaria.
