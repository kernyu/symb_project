The amikacin resistance gene aac(6')-Im [corrected] from Citrobacter freundii Cf155 encoding an aminoglycoside 6'-N-acetyltransferase was characterized. The gene was identified as a coding sequence of 521 bp located down-stream from the 5' conserved segment of an integron. The sequence of this aac(6')-Im [corrected] gene corresponded to a protein of 173 amino acids which possessed 64.2% identity in a 165-amino-acid overlap with the aac(6')-Ia gene product (F.C. Tenover, D. Filpula, K.L. Phillips, and J. J. Plorde, J. Bacteriol. 170:471-473, 1988). By using PCR, the aac(6')-Im [corrected] gene could be detected in 8 of 86 gram-negative clinical isolates from two Belgian hospitals, including isolates of Citrobacter, Klebsiella spp., and Escherichia coli. PCR mapping of the aac(6')-Im [corrected] gene environment in these isolates indicated that the gene was located within a sulI-type integron; the insert region is 1,700 bases long and includes two genes cassettes, the second being ant (3")-Ib.
