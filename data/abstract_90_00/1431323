Skin scrapings from five different active sites were collected from 14 leprosy patients and inoculated into medium V. Skin scrapings from three leprosy patients were inoculated into medium V 1. All the cultures were incubated at 8-10 degrees C. M. tuberculosis H37Rv, pretreatment isolates and streptomycin resistant strains were inoculated into medium V, with and without antibiotics, and incubated at 8-10 degrees C as well as 37 degrees C. Smears were made from the M. leprae and M. tuberculosis cultures at 0 hours and at different time points. The number of bacilli in the smears were counted. There was no increase in the number of M. leprae or M. tuberculosis in any of the cultures.
