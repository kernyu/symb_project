A synergistic bactericidal effect between penicillin, vancomycin, and gentamicin has been described against enterococci highly resistant to beta-lactams and glycopeptides. Since such a synergy was also observed in vitro between ceftriaxone, teicoplanin, and gentamicin against Enterococcus faecium 70/90, the efficacy of different combinations including penicillin or ceftriaxone, vancomycin or teicoplanin, and gentamicin was compared in vivo in experimental endocarditis. In vitro, all four triple combinations provided a bactericidal effect. In rabbits, after a 5-day treatment, the ceftriaxone-vancomycin-gentamicin combination was the most effective, both in reducing the total bacterial titers and in eradicating the subpopulation resistant to the synergy. Compared with the 5-day regimen, 10- and 20-day regimens of ceftriaxone-vancomycin-gentamicin, each followed by a 3-day antibiotic-free period, increased the number of sterilized animals but failed to avoid the emergence of resistant bacteria, which occurred in 10%-20% of animals.
