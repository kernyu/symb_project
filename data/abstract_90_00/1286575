The susceptibility of 106 oral bacteria to meropenem, a new carbapenem antimicrobial, penicillin V, tetracycline and metronidazole was assessed by an agar dilution method. Meropenem was the most effective of the antimicrobials, with all strains tested being inhibited at < or = 1 mg/l. A number of strains were resistant to penicillin V, particularly Bacteroides gracilis, and tetracycline resistance was widespread amongst the streptococci tested. Metronidazole was extremely effective against obligate anaerobes. The results of this study suggest that meropenem has potential for use in the treatment of serious head and neck infections.
