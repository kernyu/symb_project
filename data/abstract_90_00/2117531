Of the 90 strains of Enterococcus spp. isolated in an Argentine laboratory in the period from January to July 1989, three were identified as beta-lactamase-producing Enterococcus faecalis. According to the literature reviewed, these appear to be the first beta-lactamase-positive strains of Enterococcus isolated outside the USA. They differed from most beta-lactamase-producing strains already described in that they were susceptible to low concentrations of macrolides. All three strains were resistant to high concentrations of aminoglycosides.
