The triterpene RPR103611 is an efficient inhibitor of membrane fusion mediated by the envelope proteins (Env, gp120-gp41) of CXCR4-dependent (X4) human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) strains, such as HIV-1(LAI) (LAI). Other X4 strains, such as HIV-1(NDK) (NDK), and CCR5-dependent (R5) HIV-1 strains, such as HIV-1(ADA) (ADA), were totally resistant to RPR103611. Analysis of chimeric LAI-NDK Env proteins identified a fragment of the NDK gp41 ectodomain determining drug resistance. A single difference at position 91, leucine in LAI and histidine in NDK, apparently accounted for their sensitivity or resistance to RPR103611. We had previously identified a mutation of isoleucine 84 to serine in a drug escape LAI variant. Both I84 and L91 are located in the "loop region" of gp41 separating the proximal and distal helix domains. Nonpolar residues in this region therefore appear to be important for the antiviral activity of RPR103611 and are possibly part of its target. However, another mechanism had to be envisaged to explain the drug resistance of ADA, since its gp41 loop region was almost identical to that of LAI. Fusion mediated by chimeric Env consisting of LAI gp120 and ADA gp41, or the reciprocal construct, was fully blocked by RPR103611. The gp120-gp41 complex of R5 strains is stable, relative to that of X4 strains, and this stability could play a role in their drug resistance. Indeed, when the postbinding steps of ADA infection were performed under mildly acidic conditions (pH 6.5 or 6.0), a treatment expected to favor dissociation of gp120, we achieved almost complete neutralization by RPR103611. The drug resistance of NDK was partially overcome by preincubating virus with soluble CD4, a gp120 ligand inducing conformational changes in the Env complex. The antiviral efficacy of RPR103611 therefore depends on the sequence of the gp41 loop and the stability of the gp120-gp41 complex, which could limit the accessibility of this target.
