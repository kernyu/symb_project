Gradient plates were used to investigate the effects of varying temperature, pH, and sodium chloride (NaCl) concentration on nisin inhibition of Staphylococcus aureus and Listeria monocytogenes, Nisin was incorporated into the plates of 0, 50, 100, 250, and 500 IU ml -1. Gradients of pH (3.7 to 7.92) at right angles to NaCl concentration (2.1 to 7% [wt/vol]) were used for the plates, which were incubated at 20, 25, 30 and 35 degrees C. Growth on the plates were recorded by eye and by image analysis. The presence of viable but nongrowing cells was revealed by transfer to nongradient plates. Lower temperatures and greater NaCl concentrations increased the nisin inhibition of S. aureus synergistically. Increasing the NaCl concentration potentiated the nisin action against L. monocytogenes; the effect of temperature difference was not so apparent. Between pH 7.92 and ca. pH 5, a fall pH appeared to increase nisin's effectiveness against both organisms. At more acid pH values (ca. pH 4.5 to 5), the organisms showed resistance to both nisin and NaCl at 20 and 25 degrees C. Similar results were obtained with one-dimensional liquid cultures.
