Gene engineering interferon made in Russia (reaferon, realdiron) was given to 40 patients with hairy-cell leukemia. Complete and partial remissions were achieved in 56% and 28% of the patients, respectively. Minimum effect was reported in 3% of the cases. In 5 cases with primary resistance or recurrences the authors used pentostatin which produced complete remissions in all the five patients.
