The glycopeptide antibiotic vancomycin has proved valuable in the treatment of staphylococcal and enterococcal infections, particularly those caused by strains resistant to other antibiotics. The emergence of high-level resistance to vancomycin within the enterococci, and its potential for transfer to other pathogenic Gram-positive cocci, has led to interest in developing new glycopeptide antibiotics with activity against vancomycin resistant organisms. The N-alkylated glycopeptide antibiotics, under development by Lilly Research Laboratories, represent a new series of compounds possessing these properties. The lead compound in this series, LY 333328, is reported to be in Phase I trials.
