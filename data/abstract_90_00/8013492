A multiply resistant serotype 23F pneumococcus was cultured from a 3-year-old child with otitis media and five carriers at the child's day-care centre in South Africa. Attempts to eradicate carriage with mupirocin failed. The strains were identical to the Spanish clone of multiply resistant pneumococci by serotype, antimicrobial susceptibility pattern, restriction analysis of the penicillin-binding protein 1A, 2B and 2X genes and by multilocus enzyme electrophoresis. The data suggest that this clone has acquired erythromycin resistance. A possible link between the index case and residence of a family member in Spain was found.
