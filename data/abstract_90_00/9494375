OBJECTIVE: Assessment of four eradicating patterns of 6 and 12 days duration with new triple therapies adapted to our environment. PATIENTS: After an endoscopic diagnosis of Duodenal or Gastric Ulcer, and the confirmation of the presence of Helicobacter pylori using a rapid urease test in antral biopsies, 274 patients were treated with one of four eradicating therapies, verifying its efficacy with the C-13 urea breath test, at least one month after the end of the treatment and 10 days after withdrawal of proton pump inhibitors. RESULTS: Maximum eradicating efficacy was achieved with Omeprazole (20 mg/12 hours), Clarithromycin (500 mg/12 hours) and Amoxycillin (1 g/12 hours), given for 12 days (96.6%), and Omeprazole (20 mg/12 hours), Tinidazole (500 mg/12 hours) and Clarithromycin (500 mg/12 hours), also given for 12 days (95.2%). The same drugs and doses, when given during six days, achieved percentages of 78.3% and 82.2% respectively. Results with Tinidazole suggest lack of resistance to this drug in the Community of Madrid.
