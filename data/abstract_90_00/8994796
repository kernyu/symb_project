Resistance to antibiotics is becoming a major problem worldwide. Exacerbating this situation is the fact that few new antibiotics are in the development pipeline, and, indeed, no novel class of antibiotics has been introduced into medical practice in more than 20 years. It is proposed that the solutions to the problem of antibiotic resistance will be found only through fundamental research that will probably use biotechnology as a tool. A variety of novel approaches being utilized in university laboratories and biotechnology companies are outlined. Two approaches in particular, namely, Synsorbs and recombinant cationic peptide antimicrobials, that have been developed through the Canadian Bacterial Diseases Network, a national research consortium, are discussed.
