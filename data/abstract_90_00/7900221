The prevalence of drug-resistant parasites in goats in West Malaysia has rarely been reported. Ten commercial goat farms were surveyed for resistance to anthelminthics by measuring the reduction in faecal egg counts (FECs) after treatment with levamisole, pyrantel pamoate and fenbendazole. Resistance to fenbendazole was seen in most farms; there was no evidence of resistance to levamisole but some resistance to pyrantel pamoate was detected on one farm. The significance of the findings are discussed.
