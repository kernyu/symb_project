A favourable outcome of a severe Cambylobacter fetus sepsis in a neonate is reported. The transmission was probably vertical. His mother experienced diarrhoea 15 days before birth. No infecting organism was isolated from maternal stools, but maternal antibody response was significant. Such a perinatal infection with meningitis and septicemia is uncommon. Bacteriological diagnosis requires an enriched medium and a long incubation. The diagnosis should be evoked in view of an anamnestic context, a negative culture or a resistance to antimicrobial drugs.
