Human epidermoid lung carcinoma xenografts with intrinsic and induced resistance were analyzed with regarding to different parameters. The xenografts with intrinsic resistance to vincristine (HXL 54) and induced drug-resistance sublines to vincristine (HXL 55/VCR), actinomycin D (HXL 55/AD) and cisplatin (HXL 55/DDP) were characterized in terms of the degree of resistance, cross-resistance, proliferation kinetics, tumorigenicity, keratin and P-glycoprotein expression. The results demonstrate that xenografts with intrinsic or induced resistance to vincristine or actinomycin D exhibit a similar general pattern of cross-resistance to that observed in multidrug-resistant cell lines. The resistance cannot be attributed to differences in proliferation kinetics. Development of resistance is associated with loss of tumorigenicity and features of differentiation, P-glycoprotein is little expressed in the resistant xenograft lines and corresponds well with the low grade of resistance.
