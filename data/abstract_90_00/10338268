Fosfomycin tromethamine is an oral antimicrobial indicated for the treatment of uncomplicated lower urinary tract infections (UTIs). This agent is active in the urine against common uropathogens that are associated with cystitis in women, including organisms resistant to other antibiotics. A single dose of fosfomycin tromethamine is well absorbed and produces a therapeutic concentration in the urine for one to three days. Comparative clinical trials suggest that a single 3.0-g dose of fosfomycin tromethamine is as clinically effective as 7- to 10-day treatment regimens of standard agents such as nitrofurantoin, norfloxacin, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole used to treat UTIs. Fosfomycin tromethamine is well tolerated and appears safe for use during pregnancy. Quality-of-life advantages, such as enhanced compliance and convenience, are also important aspects of fosfomycin tromethamine therapy.
