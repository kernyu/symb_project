Recent studies have implicated nucleotides in diverse and unexpected functions related to p53 levels, p53-dependent G0/G1 cell cycle arrest, and the role of dATP in the activation of the caspase-induced apoptosis. Using deoxyadenosine-resistant L1210 cells (ED2 and Y8) that had ribonucleotide reductase that was not sensitive to inhibition by dATP and also exhibited other metabolic alterations, the properties of these cells with respect to the role(s) of nucleotides in these functions were explored. In the ED2 and Y8 cells that did not express p53 protein, the pools of UTP, CTP, ATP, and GTP were markedly decreased. The decreased cellular levels of UTP and CTP did not result in these cells being more sensitive to either PALA or acivicin. The ED2 and Y8 cells did not block in G0/G1 in response to PALA treatment even though the basal cellular concentrations of UTP and CTP were reduced 50 to 80%. While it has been shown that dATP in combination with cytochrome c is involved in the apoptotic pathway, the concentration of exogenous deoxyadenosine required to induce apoptosis in the parental L1210 cells was far in excess of the concentration required to inhibit cell growth. Deoxyadenosine did not cause an increase in apoptosis in the deoxyadenosine-resistant Y8 cells. These data suggest that the new roles ascribed to nucleotides may be specific for the particular cell type under very specific conditions.
