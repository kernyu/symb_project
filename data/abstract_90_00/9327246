The activity of some third generation cephalosporins, aztreonam, imipenem, ciprofloxacin, and amikacin against isolates of Acinetobacter baumannii of various biotypes has been studied. The isolates, independently of the biotype, exhibited a broad multiresistance against cephalosporins. Ceftazidime was the most active and cefoperazone the least active compound. Aztreonam also showed low activity and no imipenem-resistant strains were found. Ciprofloxacin and amikacin were somewhat more active than cephalosporins, but resistant isolates were also frequent. Isolates of Biotypes 9 and 8 exhibited broader multiresistance than those of Biotype 6 and "other."
