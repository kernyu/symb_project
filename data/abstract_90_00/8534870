The ability of the antiangiogenic agents TNP-470 and minocycline, singly or in combination, to potentiate the antitumor effects of several cytotoxic therapies was assessed in the murine EMT-6 mammary carcinoma as well as in two drug resistant sublines of that tumor designated EMT-6/CTX and EMT-6/CDDP. The antiangiogenic agents alone or in combination did not alter the growth of the tumors. However, their administration along with cyclophosphamide, CDDP, or thiotepa substantially increased the tumor growth delay produced by these cytotoxic therapies in tumors responsive to the drugs--the increase was about 2-fold for TNP-470 and minocycline together. In drug resistant tumors, treatment with the antiangiogenic agents did not reverse drug resistance but did increase the effect of the cytotoxic drugs. Treatment with TNP-470/minocycline also increased the oxygenation of each of the three tumors. Thus, TNP-470/minocycline administration increased the efficacy of fractionated radiation therapy, especially when used along with a perflubron emulsion oxygen delivery agent/carbogen. These results indicate that treatment regimens including therapies directed toward the proliferating normal cells within a tumor mass as well as therapies directed toward the malignant cells can produce improved outcomes.
