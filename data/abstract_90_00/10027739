It has been reported that benfluorex ameliorates the insulin resistance induced by high-fat feeding when its administration is initiated at the same time as the change in diet. Here we have examined whether benfluorex reverses insulin resistance when this is established in middle-aged rats chronically maintained on a high-fat diet. Untreated 12-month-old rats that had been subjected to a high-fat diet for the last 6 months showed markedly lower insulin-induced stimulation of 2-deoxyglucose uptake by strips of soleus muscle and a reduced expression of GLUT4 glucose carriers in skeletal muscle. However, animals subjected to the same protocol but treated with benfluorex during the last month of high-fat feeding showed marked improvement in insulin-stimulated glucose transport by soleus muscle. Benfluorex treatment caused a substantial increase in the content of GLUT4 protein in white muscle; however, GLUT4 levels in red muscle remained low. Our results indicate: (i) that benfluorex treatment in middle-aged rats reverses the insulin resistance induced by high-fat feeding in soleus muscle; (ii) benfluorex is active even when it is administered once the insulin-resistant state is already established; (iii) reversion of muscle insulin resistance by benfluorex can occur independently of modifications in GLUT4 protein expression.
