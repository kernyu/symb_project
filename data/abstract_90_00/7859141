Ninety-three symptomatic HIV antibody positive patients were randomized to receive zidovudine (ZDV) 600 mg/day and acyclovir (ACV) 4,800 mg orally per day versus ZDV 600 mg/day plus placebo. Urine was obtained at 3-month intervals and cultured for cytomegalovirus (CMV) in diploid fibroblast cells. The percent of urine specimens positive for CMV was 7.1% in the ZDV group and 5.8% in the ZDV plus ACV group (p = 0.55); 27% of patients had at least one urine culture positive for CMV while taking ZDV, versus 20% of patients taking the combination of ZDV plus ACV (p = 0.52). We conclude that ACV at a dosage of 4,800 mg/day does not suppress CMV excretion in urine of symptomatic HIV antibody positive patients taking concurrent ZDV. Use of ACV did not appear to induce resistance of CMV to ganciclovir since the ID50 of isolates from the two treatment groups did not differ.
