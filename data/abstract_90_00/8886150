A total of one hundred and two cases of otitis media were screened for the isolation of bacterial flora of ears. Out of this, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae accounting for 41.2%, 25.5% and 13.3% respectively were isolated. A further two hundred and four sputum samples from cases of lower respiratory tract infections were screened. Moraxella catarrhalis, S. aureus, S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae constituting 20.9%, 37%, 30% and 21% were isolated in that order. Thirty-one point seven percent of the Moraxella catarrhalis isolates were beta-lactamase positive. Beta-lactamase M. catarrhalis were resistant to penicillin and ampicillin while the non-beta-lactamase producers were sensitive to these antimicrobial agents. However, both beta-lactamase producers and non-producers were resistant to trimethoprim but sensitive to erythromycin, tetracycline and amoxycillin. Staphylococcus aureus, S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae was also sensitive to penicillin while S. pneumoniae was also sensitive to erythromycin and H. influenzae to chloramphenicol.
