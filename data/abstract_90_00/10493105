To evaluate the contribution of cytochrome P450 (CYP450) metabolites of arachidonic acid in the increased renal vascular resistance and blunted pressure-natriuresis response exhibited by Lyon hypertensive (LH) rats, the effects of an intrarenal infusion of 17-octadecynoic acid (3 microM), an inhibitor of the formation of epoxyeicosatrienoic and 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids, were compared in 8-week-old LH and low blood pressure (LL) control rats. 17-Octadecynoic acid failed to affect renal function in LL rats. In contrast, it reduced renal vascular resistance and shifted the pressure-natriuresis relationship to lower pressures in LH rats. Blockade of thromboxane-endoperoxide (TP) receptors with GR 32191B prevented the renal vasodilator response to 17-octadecynoic acid but not its natriuretic action. Miconazole (1 microM), an inhibitor of epoxygenase activity, had no effect on renal function in LH rats. These results indicate that CYP450 metabolites of arachidonic acid, likely 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid, contribute to the resetting of the pressure-natriuresis relation in LH rats and that the renal vasoconstrictor effects of 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid in LH rats may be related to activation of TP receptors.
