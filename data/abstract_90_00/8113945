The use of antibiotic-impregnated polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) cement beads for the local delivery of antibiotics in the treatment of chronic osteomyelitis has become a standard orthopaedic practice. The increasing resistance to antibiotics of organisms associated with orthopaedic infections has led to interest in the incorporation of more effective antibiotics into PMMA cement. Ciprofloxacin, a synthetic fluoroquinolone, is potent against a broad spectrum of bacteria associated with osteomyelitis. In this study, strands of ciprofloxacin-impregnated PMMA cement beads were prepared with 0.2, 0.5, or 1.0 g of ciprofloxacin per 40 g of PMMA. The elution concentration of ciprofloxacin was at least 1-2 mcg/ml for 7 days (0.2 g), 30 days (0.5 g), and 42 days (1.0 g). This concentration is equivalent to the minimum inhibitory concentration for the common pathogens associated with osteomyelitis. Concurrent systemic and local ciprofloxacin therapy appears to be a method for the treatment of chronic osteomyelitis.
