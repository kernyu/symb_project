A total of 91 catalase--negative Gram-positive coccal isolates obtained from 245 clinical specimens in Lagos were characterized. Ten (11.0%) of the isolates were vancomycin resistant, they fermented glucose, sucrose, fructose, lactose, mannose, mannitol, ribose, salicin, sorbitol, arabinose and xylose with acid production. One of the isolates produced in addition gas inclusive and ethanol, thus identified as Leuconostoc mesenteroides. The ten vancomycin-resistant Gram-positive coccal organisms (VRGPC) showed variable sensitivity patterns to penicillin, tetracycline, erythromycin, ampicillin, streptomycin, chloramphenicol, cloxacillin and co-trimoxazole. The possible role of Leuconostoc spp. and VRGPC in clinical infections in hospital setting is still to be defined.
