An outbreak of extended spectrum beta lactamase producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (ESBLKp) in a neonatal unit was controlled using simple measures. Normally, the control of such infections can be time consuming and expensive. Seven cases of septicaemia resulted in two deaths. ESBLKp isolates were subtyped by pulsed field gel electrophoresis, and four of the five isolates typed were identical. Control of the outbreak was achieved by altered empiric antibiotic treatment for late onset sepsis and prevention of cross infection by strict attention to hand washing. Widespread colonisation of babies in the unit was presumed, so initial surveillance cultures were not performed. No further episodes of sepsis occurred.
