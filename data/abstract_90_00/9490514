A study was made of geno- and phenotypic changes, associated with of multidrug resistance development in murine 1F7 hybridoma cells, selected for adriamycin and ethidium bromide resistance (1F7-EBR and 1F7-ADR). In both cell lines overexpression of mdr1 gene was observed, while amplification of mdr1 gene was detected only in 1F7-ADR cells. Karyotypic analysis revealed in resistant cells the presence of a specific marker M45 absent from parental cells, thus suggesting its selective importance. The M45 length instability, as well as the presence of a distal typical homogeneously stained region in it provide an evidence for a link between M45 and mdr1 gene amplification. The frequency of double minute chromosomes in parental lines was the same as in multidrug resistant lines. In 1F7-ADR cells, in contrast with 1F7-EBR cells, the enhancement of immunoglobulin production and the increase in immunoglobulin gamma 2b heavy chain gene expression were observed, which correlated with a decline in DNA-topoisomerase II activity.
