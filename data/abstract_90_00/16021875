Pharmacological resistance is the decreased susceptibility of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) to antiviral drugs without evidence of genotypic or phenotypic resistance. It may be caused by a decreased activation of drugs and/or decreased drug penetration into compartments where viral replication occurs. Several issues related to drug activation and penetration into body compartments in light of pharmacological resistance are discussed in this paper. The affinity of antiviral drugs for the multidrug transporter P-glycoprotein (Pgp) and the potential clinical significance of research in this area are also presented.
