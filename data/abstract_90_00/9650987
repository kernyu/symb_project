We compared the line probe assay (LiPA) to sequence analysis for the detection of mutations conferring resistance to nucleoside inhibitors of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) reverse transcriptase (RT). Plasma samples from 40 patients who had received zidovudine, dideoxyinosine, and dideoxycytosine, alone or in combination, and who were enrolled in the ALTIS 2 clinical trial (lamivudine [3TC] plus stavudine) were tested at enrollment and at week 24. RT PCR products from plasma were used for LiPA, and DNA was used for sequence analysis. LiPA gave uninterpretable results for 8.5% of the analyzed codons corresponding to 63 samples, mainly for codons 41, 69, and 70. Several minor discrepancies between the two methods occurred, mainly due to the ability of LiPA to detect mixed populations while sequence analyses detect a single homogeneous population. LiPA is suitable for detecting mixed populations and easy to implement in clinical laboratories and might be useful for epidemiological surveys of primary HIV-1 resistance.
