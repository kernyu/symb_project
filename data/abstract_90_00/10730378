Over a period of 20 months we investigated 1366 vaginal specimens from pregnant women for GBS (group B streptococci) carrier in three microscopic patterns, evaluated by Nugent score system. More frequently we isolated GBS in group I intermedia (score 4-6)--20.8%, (when Lactobacillus spp. is missing--67.4%, without or associated with other nonanaerobic microorganisms (60.5%). All isolated GBS strains showed sensitivity to ampicillin and carbenicillin. Good sensitivity was found to cefazolin (92.4%) ant to cefuroxim (94.9%). The strains showed 13.7% resistance to erythromycin and 4.1% to clindamycin.
