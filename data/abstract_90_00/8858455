The evolution of imipenem resistance was evaluated in Pseudomonas aeruginosa sequentially isolated from 42 patients with cystic fibrosis. Susceptibility was determined using a commercial microdilution system and imipenem resistance was confirmed by the agar dilution technique. Resistance to imipenem increased during the years from 1988 to 1992. A total of 12 patients (28.5%) carried resistant strains (11.6% of the total P. aeruginosa isolates) but only two of them were treated with the carbapenem. The other patient under imipenem treatment did not harbour resistant isolates. Sixty-four per cent of the imipenem resistant isolates were also meropenem resistant and showed low susceptibility to the other beta-lactams and tobramycin and amikacin. Twenty-one strains were selected for biochemical study. Imipenem susceptible strains showed normal OprD in two strains and diminished OprD in two more. Five strains with MIC of imipenem of 4-8 mg/L lacked OprD while another two had a band with decreased density. All strains with MIC higher than 8 completely lacked this band in western-blot analysis. Imipenem MICs of 0.5-2 mg/L only slightly increased to 1-4 mg/L when a pattern of beta-lactamase derepression was observed. While those with imipenem MICs between 8-16 mg/L increased the imipenem MIC to 16-64 mg/L in the population with a beta-lactamase derepression phenotype.
