This surveillance study was conducted simultaneously at three centres across India. A total of 13,610 test samples from various sites were obtained. Microbiological methods employed were similar at the three centres. Identification of S aureus was based on the recognition of the production of coagulase with positive isolates being recorded as S aureus. Both tube coagulase tests and slide coagulase test were performed. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing of the isolated strains of staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis to various antimicrobial discs were carried out according to standardized disk diffusion method recommended by NCCLS. Of the total 739 cultures of S aureus, 235 (32%) were found to be multiply resistant with the individual figures for resistance being 27% (Bombay), 42.5% (Delhi) and 47% (Bangalore). MRSA is emerging to be a significant problem pathogen in the surgical setting with vancomycin probably the only reliable choice for these infections.
