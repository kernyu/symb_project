Single-crossover homologous integration in Lactobacillus sake was studied. Integration was conducted with nonreplicative delivery vector pRV300. This vector is composed of a pBluescript SK- replicon for propagation in Escherichia coli and an erythromycin resistance marker. Random chromosomal DNA fragments of L. sake 23K ranging between 0.3 and 3.4 kb were inserted into pRV300. The resulting plasmids were able to integrate into the chromosome by homologous recombination as single copies and were maintained stably. The single cross-over integration frequency was logarithmically proportional to the extent of homology between 0.3 and 1.2 kb and reached a maximum value of 1.4 x 10(3) integrants/micrograms of DNA. We used this integration strategy to inactivate the ptsI gene, encoding enzyme I of the phosphoenolpyruvate:carbohydrate phosphotransferase system, and the lacL gene, which is one of the two genes required for the synthesis of a functional beta-galactosidase. The results indicated that our method facilitates genetic analysis of L. sake.
