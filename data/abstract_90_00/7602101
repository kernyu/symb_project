Previously, we reported that the expression of hsp65 within and on host macrophages correlates closely with protection against infection with Toxoplasma gondii in mice. Herein, we propose that gamma delta T cells play a crucial role in the induction of hsp65 and also in the protective immune response to T. gondii. Intraperitoneal inoculation with this protozoan resulted in hsp65 being expressed on and in host peritoneal macrophages and resulted in an increase of T cells bearing the gamma delta receptor with Thy-1+ and Thy-1- phenotypes in the peritoneal cavity and spleen. When mice were depleted of gamma delta T cells by the administration of a mAb, hsp65 expression was markedly decreased. In contrast, the expression of this protein was rather enhanced and gamma delta T cells were prominently expanded in mice depleted of alpha beta T cells. The protection in mice treated with the mAb paralleled the magnitude of hsp65 expression. Mice depleted of gamma delta T cells died most frequently in the early stages of infection, whereas most of those depleted of alpha beta T cells survived the early stages of lethal infection with T. gondii. However, the latter group of mice did not definitely control the T. gondii infection in its late stages. IFN-gamma was not essential for either the expression of hsp65 or the resistance induced by gamma delta T cells, as demonstrated in mice treated with mAb to murine IFN-gamma. These findings indicated that gamma delta T cells having both the Thy-1+ and Thy-1- phenotypes contribute to hsp65 expression within and on macrophages in an IFN-gamma-independent manner. This, in turn, plays a role in the development of protective immunity during the early stage of this parasitic infection.
