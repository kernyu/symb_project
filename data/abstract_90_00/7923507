The antiseptic activity of Listerine and Cool Mint Listerine against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Candida albicans, human immuno deficiency virus (HIV) and oral bacteria was examined in this study. Exposure for 30 seconds to Listerine killed MRSA completely. Exposure for 30 seconds significantly decreased viable cells of C. albicans. More than 60% of HIV was inactivated by a 30 second exposure to 50% Listerine. Listerine exhibited a potent bactericidal effect against cariogenic and periodontopathic bacteria. Cool Mint Listerine had almost the same antiseptic effect against tested microorganisms. Listerine appears to be effective for killing etiologic microorganisms of opportunistic infection in the oral cavity.
