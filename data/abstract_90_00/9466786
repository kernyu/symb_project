A collection of genetically unrelated vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) including 50 vanA, 15 vanB, 50 vanC1, and 30 vanC2 VRE were used to evaluate the accuracy of eight currently available susceptibility test methods (agar dilution, disk diffusion, E-test, agar screen plate, Vitek GPS-TA and GPS-101, and MicroScan overnight and rapid panels). vanA VRE were detected by all methods. vanB VRE were often not detected by Vitek GPS-TA and MicroScan rapid (sensitivities, 47 and 53%, respectively), though the new Vitek GPS-101 was found to be a significant improvement. E-test and the agar screen were the only two methods detecting all VRE, including the vanC1/C2 VRE.
