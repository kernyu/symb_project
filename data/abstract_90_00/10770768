In this study, 176 clinical and environmental Vibrio cholerae strains of different O serotypes isolated in Thailand from 1982 to 1995 were selected and studied for the presence of class 1 integrons, a new group of genetic elements which carry antibiotic resistance genes. Using PCR and DNA sequencing, we found that 44 isolates contained class 1 integrons harboring the aadB, aadA2, blaP1, dfrA1, and dfrA15 gene cassettes, which encode resistance to gentamicin, kanamycin, and tobramycin; streptomycin and spectinomycin; beta-lactams; and trimethoprim, respectively. Each cassette array contained only a single antibiotic resistance gene. Although resistance genes in class 1 integrons were found in strains from the same epidemic, as well as in unrelated non-O1, non-O139 strains isolated from children with diarrhea, they were found to encode only some of the antibiotic resistance expressed by the strains. Serotype O139 strains did not contain class 1 integrons. However, the appearance and disappearance of the O139 serotype in the coastal city Samutsakorn in 1992 and 1993 were associated with the emergence of a distinct V. cholerae O1 strain which contained the aadA2 resistance gene cassette. A 150-kb self-transmissible plasmid found in three O1 strains isolated in 1982 contained the aadB gene cassette. Surprisingly, several strains harbored two integrons containing different cassettes. Thus, class 1 integrons containing various resistance gene cassettes are distributed among different V. cholerae O serotypes of mainly clinical origin in Thailand.
