AY 9944 [AY; trans-1,4-bis(chlorobenzylaminomethyl)-cyclohexane dihydrochloride], an inhibitor of sterol synthesis, was found to help restore the normal mitogenic responses and cytokine profiles of peripheral mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from AIDS patients in vitro. Compared to untreated cells, the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-infected PBMCs precultured in the presence of AY exhibited a normal rate of either mitogen-induced or recall- and superantigen-induced proliferation. After 2 weeks in the presence of the drug, the percentage of dead CD4(+) cells in HIV-1-infected cultures was comparable to that observed in uninfected cultures, while over the same time interval it increased by three- to fivefold in HIV-1-infected cultures maintained in the absence of AY. AY also stimulated by 2- to 12-fold interleukin-12 (IL-12) and (gamma interferon production. For IL-12, this effect appears to be related to an increase in corresponding IL-12 p35 and IL-12 p40 mRNA levels. Moreover, AY restored the expression of the IL-2 receptor, which was severely impaired in HIV-1-infected PBMCs. Although the drug has no direct antiviral effect (it does not significantly inhibit reverse transcriptase activity measured in vitro), it might be considered a potential therapeutic agent for HIV-infected patients, in that it may correct viral infection-related immune system defects by indirectly enhancing the level of resistance to HIV and opportunistic infections.
