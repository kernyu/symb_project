gyrA mutations in quinolone-resistant isolates of Aeromonas salmonicida have been detected by using PCR to amplify the quinolone resistance-determining region of gyrA and subsequent cloning and sequencing of PCR products. Comparison of nucleotide and derived amino acid sequences of PCR products from quinolone-susceptible and -resistant bacteria revealed a serine 83-to-isoleucine substitution in the gyrase A protein of resistant isolates. One of the resistant isolates differed from the other by a two- to fourfold-higher MIC of the fluoroquinolone enrofloxacin and carried an additional alanine 67-to-glycine substitution, which may contribute to the higher level of resistance.
