The in vitro activities of omeprazole and eight antimicrobial agents against 18 clinical strains of Helicobacter pylori isolated from a pediatric population were determined by an agar dilution method. Ampicillin and erythromycin were the most active agents in vitro. All strains were susceptible to azithromycin, ciprofloxacin, doxycycline, metronidazole, and tinidazole. One isolate demonstrated resistance to cefixime (MIC, greater than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml). H. pylori was inhibited by the proton pump inhibitor omeprazole.
