Antibiotic and antiseptic preparations, currently used in medical practice, have been tested on the same P. aeruginosa samples and compared by the amplitude of their minimal inhibiting concentration (MIC) values, determined as the average MIC values for the samples under test, by the proportion of variants resistant to the tested preparations, by the distribution of strains in the resistance spectrum, and by the pace of the increase of resistant variants under natural conditions in 5-10 years. On the basis of the results obtained in this study a conclusion has been made that in some cases of local application antiseptic preparations have advantages over antibiotics, especially in controlling hospital strains of microorganisms. The authors believe that the heterogeneity of microbial populations, as well as the frequency of the appearance of resistant variants and the activity of the mechanisms of their selection in hospitals, is of great importance in the development of new preparations, in the re-evaluation of currently used preparations and in the choice of the optimum preparation in concrete situations.
