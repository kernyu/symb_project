Genotypic analysis of resistance to isoniazid (INH) in Mycobacterium tuberculosis is complex due to the various genes potentially involved. Mutations in ketoacyl acyl carrier protein synthase (encoded by kasA) were present in 16 of 160 (10%) INH-resistant isolates (R121K [n = 1], G269S [n = 3], G312S [n = 11], G387D [n = 1]). However, G312S was also present in 6 of 32 (19%) susceptible strains. kasA analysis contributed marginally to the performance of INH genotypic testing in Singapore. The significance of kasA polymorphisms in INH resistance should be carefully established.
