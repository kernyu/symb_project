Tet(M) protein interacts with the protein biosynthetic machinery to render this process resistant to the tetracycline in vivo and in vitro (V. Burdett, J. Biol. Chem. 266:2872-2877, 1991). To understand this process more completely, a mutant of Escherichia coli which is altered in the ability of Tet(M) to confer resistance has been identified. This mutation maps to miaA and displays phenotypes characteristic of previously isolated miaA mutations. The miaA gene product modifies A37 adjacent to the anticodon of several tRNA species. Both the mutant isolated in this work and previously isolated miaA mutants confer tetracycline sensitivity in the presence of functional Tet(M), both share a slow growth phenotype, and in neither case is a wild-type phenotype restored in trans by F'112 carrying the 89- to 98-min region of the chromosome. These similar phenotypes further substantiate the assignment of the mutation described here to the miaA locus.
