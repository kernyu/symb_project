Enteropathogenic strains of Vibrio parahaemolyticus were isolated from shrimps, Penaeus monodon collected from the region of the Deltaic Sundarbans (West Bengal, India). About 63% of the isolated strains were resistant to ampicillin, cephalexin, and kanamycin. However, all these strains were sensitive to nitrofurantoin, nalidixic acid, tetracycline, and norfloxacin. The isolated strains were resistant to Ni2+] (75%), Cu2+ (87%), and Co2+ (37%), but all the strains were resistant against Cd2+, Zn2+, and Pb2+ at 10 mM concentration.
