This study uses a recently developed technique for preserving the ultrastructure of cells in the insect CNS during immunohistochemical processing for 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine incorporation into newly synthesised DNA. The results allow us to identify the proliferating cell classes in the regenerating blood-brain barrier. High resistance barrier cells do not label with the antibody but sheath cells clearly do. Intermediate cell types appearing during repair are identified. It is hypothesised that these cells generate matrix molecules for neural lamella repair and may represent transitional forms as invasive blood cells transdifferentiate into functional sheath cells.
