The median of survival among patients with multiple myeloma (MM) is about 30 months from the onset of treatment. Tumour burden and a range of other parameters, such as C-reactive protein levels, the plasma cell labelling index and beta2-microglobulin levels, can be used to assign patients to favourable and unfavourable prognostic groups. Conventional chemotherapy consists of melphalan and prednisone, and is as effective as moderately intensive cytotoxic drug regimens. Although second-line chemotherapy is initially effective, all patients eventually die. Maintenance therapy will interferon-alpha prolongs the plateau phase of the disease, but its effects on overall survival are minimal. One of the promising developments in the treatment of MM has been the introduction of high dosage chemotherapy, which can now be safely administered when stem cells are used for haematological recovery. Autologous bone marrow transplantation has been shown to produce a significant improvement in survival compared with conventional therapy. Several studies are under way that are examining the effects of multiple courses of high dosage chemotherapy together with peripheral stem cell support. Purging of autologous stem cell harvests will be performed in the near future to minimise contamination with myeloma cells. It is now feasible to use high dosage chemotherapy, with the support of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor-stimulated whole blood, in selected elderly patients. Besides the promising development of intensive therapy, a number of other treatment strategies have emerged, including treatment with monoclonal antibodies against interleukin-6 and multidrug resistance-modulating agents. Better supportive care can be provided for some patients by using epoetin (recombinant human erythropoietin), and the sequelae of lytic bone lesions can be ameliorated through the use of bisphosphonates.
