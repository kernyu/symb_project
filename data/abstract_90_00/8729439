Significant recent advances in the understanding of plant defense mechanisms include the isolation and characterization of resistance genes against bacterial, fungal and viral pathogens, the identification of genes involved in cell death, and the demonstration of the involvement of reactive oxygen species and salicylic acid in the signal-transduction pathways for expression of induced resistance.
