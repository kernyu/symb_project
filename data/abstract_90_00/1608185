In 225 children (135 boys, 90 girls) suffering from clinical relevant urinary tract infection the bacterial spectrum and resistance behaviour to routinely used antibiotics were evaluated. In 65.4% of the patients a significant bacteriuria was found: E. coli (34.6%), proteus (22.3%), klebsiella (14.6%), citrobacter (9.2%), enterobacter (5.4%) and pseudomonas (5.4%). In testing a high resistance of bacterias to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazol, ampicillin, and gentamycin was found, whereas good susceptibility was found to nitrofurantoin and nalidixin acid.
