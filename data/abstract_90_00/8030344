On the basis of vaginal secretion cultures in 520 pregnant women admitted for labour, the susceptibility to drugs was studied of bacteria present in it. Four basic antibiotic groups were taken into account: penicillin derivatives, tetracyclines, aminoglycosides, cephalosporins. A higher resistance to the studied drugs was found of Gram (+) than Gram (-) bacteria, while the highest susceptibility was found to cephalosporins, and the lowest to aminoglycosides. Of interest was the high sensitivity of microorganisms to penicillin derivatives, which is of significant importance in view of their slight side effects and relatively low treatment cost.
