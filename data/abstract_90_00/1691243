As human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) has become better understood, numerous drugs have been developed that act at virus-specific sites. These are challenging our ability to evaluate them thoroughly and rapidly. Zidovudine (AZT) remains the mainstay of anti-HIV-1 drugs. Recent controlled trials indicate it should be used early in infection (in those with CD4 cell counts less than 500/mm3) and in lower doses (500-600 mg/day). Prolonged AZT treatment in patients with AIDS, however, is often associated with viral resistance. Newer reverse transcriptase-inhibiting nucleoside derivatives are currently in phase II-III clinical trials. Other HIV-1 replicative sites under attack in clinical studies include binding and entry of virus, envelope protein glycosylation, and viral assembly and release. Agents that target HIV-1 proteinase, integrase, ribonuclease H, and products of regulatory genes such as tat are under development. Combination therapies that target different viral replicative sites likely will allow use of individual agents below their toxic concentrations and help prevent drug resistance. Innovative programs for expanded access to experimental drugs are needed that will permit expeditious clinical trials, optimize the gathering of useful information, and permit the widest access to promising treatments.
