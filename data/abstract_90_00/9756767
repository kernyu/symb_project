Multiple isolates of Cryptococcus neoformans, including those with fluconazole resistance, were tested to assess the in vitro activity of the new triazole TAK-187. MICs of TAK-187 were at least eightfold lower than those of fluconazole, and fungicidal concentrations for most isolates were 4 microg/ml or less. TAK-187 also was evaluated as intermittent therapy using two dosages in a rabbit model of experimental cryptococcal meningitis. Compared to daily treatment with fluconazole, as little as two doses of TAK-187 given 7 days apart were found to be effective. Plasma and cerebrospinal fluid TAK-187 concentrations were many times higher than MICs and fungicidal concentrations. Based upon its therapeutic efficacy and long half-life in the rabbit model, TAK-187 should be investigated for intermittent dosing in treatment or suppression of cryptococcal infections in humans.
