AIM: To determine the susceptibilities of Mycoplasma and Ureaplasma to (S)-(-)-9-fluoro-2,3-dihydro-3-methyl-10 -[4-(2-pyridyl)-1-piperazinyl]-7-oxo-7H-pyrido[1,2,3-de][1,4]benzoxazine -6-carboxylic acid (YH-6) and to compare it with those referential quinolones, macrolides, and tetracyclines. METHODS: The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) were determined by microdilution method in vitro. RESULTS: The MIC of YH-6 for Ureaplasma urealyticum (Uu: 250 micrograms.L-1), Mycoplasma hominis (Mh: 500 micrograms.L-1), M orale (Mo: 125 micrograms.L-1) and M salivarium (Ms: 125 micrograms.L-1) were closely similar to those of macrolides (erythromycin and leucomycin) and were 2-8 folds greater than those of ofloxacin (Ofl). Uu and Mh easily induced resistance to erythromycin and tetracycline. They did not easily form resistance to quinolone (YH-6, Ofl), josamycin and tylosin. Tetracycline-resistance (Tcr) or erythromycin-resistance (EMr) strains of Uu (or Mh) had cross-resistance to erythromycin or tetracycline. However, they had no cross-resistance to quinolone, josamycin and tylosin. CONCLUSION: YH-6 was a highly active quinolone against Mycoplasma, but could hardly induce resistance to Uu. EMr- or Tcr- strains of Uu (or Mh) had no cross-resistance to YH-6.
