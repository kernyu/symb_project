OBJECTIVE: To explore the clinical implication of reversal of multidrug resistance (MDR) by cyclosporin A (CsA) in refractory and relapsed acute leukemias. METHODS: The expression of p170 was assayed by immunocytochemical method (Avidin-Biotin Complex, ABC) using a monoclonal antibody JSB-1 against P-170. The P-170 positive cases were randomly divided into two groups:trial group (with CsA as revertant) and control group (without CsA), and the blood concentration of CsA was detected by HPLC. RESULTS: The complete remission rates were 53% and 20% in trial and control group, respectively (P<0.05), and the reversing effect was positively correlated with blood concentration of CsA. CONCLUSION: CsA might be a safe and effective revertant, and can be applied in the treatment of refractory and relapsed acute leukemia.
