The DNA fragment containing the acrA locus of the Escherichia coli chromosome has been cloned by using a complementation test. The nucleotide sequence indicates the presence of two open reading frames (ORFs). Sequence analysis suggests that the first ORF encodes a 397-residue lipoprotein with a 24-amino-acid signal peptide at its N terminus. One inactive allele of acrA from strain N43 was shown to contain an IS2 element inserted into this ORF. Therefore, this ORF was designated acrA. The second downstream ORF is predicted to encode a transmembrane protein of 1,049 amino acids and is named acrE. Genes acrA and acrE are probably located on the same operon, and both of their products are likely to affect drug susceptibilities observed in wild-type cells. The cellular localizations of these polypeptides have been analyzed by making acrA::TnphoA and acrE::TnphoA fusion proteins. Interestingly, AcrA and AcrE share 65 and 77% amino acid identity with two other E. coli polypeptides, EnvC and EnvD, respectively. Drug susceptibilities in one acrA mutant (N43) and one envCD mutant (PM61) have been determined and compared. Finally, the possible functions of these proteins are discussed.
