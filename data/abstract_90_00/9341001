The dynamics of the microflora in the foci of surgical infection in 54 patients was studied. Staphylococci and streptococci prevailed among the primarily isolated causative agents. In complicated forms of surgical infection of soft tissues the change of causative agents, mainly to gram-negative opportunistic microflora with a higher level of resistance to antibiotics and high antilysozyme activity, was observed more often than in noncomplicated forms of such infection.
