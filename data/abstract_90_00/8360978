Antimicrobial activity of clarithromycin (CAM) in comparison with other 6 macrolides was determined against 419 recent clinical isolates including Streptococci, Enterococci, Staphylococci, Moraxella, Haemophilus and Bacteroides strains. MICs80's of CAM against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae were 0.78, 0.10 and 0.10 microgram/ml, respectively. MICs80's against Moraxella catarrhalis and Haemophilus influenzae were 0.05 and 1.56 micrograms/ml, respectively. Laboratory-induced resistance to CAM in strains of S. pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis or methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus epidermidis occurred in stepwise fashion and at a very low rate. Adherence to silicon filter of strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa or S. epidermidis was strongly repressed by the addition of sub-MIC of CAM or other macrolides. Although tosufloxacin (TFLX) alone had no bactericidal activity against the sessile cells of P. aeruginosa strains tested, TFLX showed synergistic bactericidal activity when combined with sub-MICs of CAM or erythromycin.
