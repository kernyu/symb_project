44 patients with advanced breast cancer were treated with high-dose epirubicin (130 mg/sqm), because of its steep dose-response curve. Lonidamine and alpha interferon were administered as well with the aim of increasing epirubicin uptake and overcoming drug resistance. Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor support was provided. 14 complete responses and 22 partial responses were observed in 40 evaluable patients for a 90% overall response rate. Median duration of response was 12 months for complete responders, 7 months for partial responders. In two cases the complete response has lasted for more than two years. Myelosuppression, infection, and cardiac toxicity were the main treatment-related toxic effects. These results are encouraging enough to justify a randomized comparison of our chemotherapy program with standard regimens used in advanced breast cancer.
