One hundred and eight strains of Aeromonas from clinical and environmental samples were speciated. Seven species were identified, the most prevalent of which was A. hydrophila. Experimental studies in an animal model with 36 representative strains of different species revealed that all strains could cause significant fluid accumulation in rabbit ileal loops. Of 107 strains showing single or multiple antimicrobial resistance, the highest incidence of resistance was shown for beta-lactam antibiotics other than cefotaxime. Transferable resistance plasmids, encoding resistance to ampicillin, cephalexin, cefoxitin, erythromycin and furazolidone, either alone or in combination, were detected in 35 strains. A further proportion of strains could be cured of one or more resistance markers, including resistance to nalidixic acid, and this was accompanied by the loss of plasmid DNA. The plasmids ranged in size between 85.6 and > 1 50 kb.
