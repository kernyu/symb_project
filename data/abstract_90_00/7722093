The in vitro susceptibility of Staphylococcus aureus to eight fluoroquinolones, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, enoxacin, ciprofloxacin, lomefloxacin, tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin, and nadifloxacin was established by agar dilution tests, 71 isolates of methicillin-susceptible (MSSA) and 74 isolates of -resistant S. aureus (MRSA) isolated from skin infections. Among all of the fluoroquinolones, nadifloxacin exhibited the lowest MIC for both MSSA and MRSA. In addition, there were no resistant S. aureus, neither MSSA and MRSA, to nadifloxacin. With the exception of nadifloxacin, the incidence of MRSA resistant to fluoroquinolones has gradually increased in recent years. Over half of the MRSA strains were resistant to norfloxacin, ofloxacin, enoxacin, ciprofloxacin, and lomefloxacin.
