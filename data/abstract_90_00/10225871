Comparison of immune responses induced in cattle by virulent and attenuated strains of Mycobacterium bovis will assist in identifying responses associated with resistance or susceptibility to disease. Four strains of M. bovis, one which is virulent in guinea pigs (WAg201) and three which are attenuated in guinea pigs (an isoniazid-resistant strain [WAg405], ATCC 35721, and BCG) were compared for their abilities to induce immune responses in cattle and to grow in bovine lung alveolar macrophage cultures. Extensive macroscopic lesions were found only in cattle inoculated with the virulent M. bovis strain. Strong antibody responses to M. bovis culture filtrate, as well as persistently high levels of gamma interferon and interleukin-2 released from purified protein derivative (PPD)-stimulated peripheral blood lymphocyte cultures, were observed in the cattle inoculated with the virulent strain compared to those inoculated with the attenuated strains. All cattle inoculated with the virulent strain or two of the attenuated strains (WAg405 and ATCC 35721) elicited strong delayed-type hypersensitivity responses to PPD in skin tests, while animals inoculated with BCG induced only a weak response. The three strains which produced strong skin test responses proliferated well in bovine alveolar macrophages and induced high levels of proinflammatory cytokine mRNAs compared to BCG. Our study showed that skin test responsiveness to PPD correlated with the ability of the strains to grow in alveolar macrophages rather than to their pathogenicity in cattle.
