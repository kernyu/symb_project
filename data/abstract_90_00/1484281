The aim of this study was to determine if inability to complete a breath alcohol test successfully, using a Lion Alcolmeter SD-2 or Drager Alcotest 7110, was related to any of the standard parameters obtained from the lung function spirometry test. A total of 153 subjects referred to a clinical laboratory for routine lung function testing were tested using the Alcolmeter, 158 using the Alcotest, with 69 subjects completing tests on both instruments. Of the 153 patients who volunteered to use the Alcolmeter, 49 (32%) were unable to produce a valid test effort on this instrument. One subject failed to complete a satisfactory test using the Alcotest, and one was unable to master the technique. There was considerable overlap of the minimum value for each of the lung function parameters of those subjects who could or could not successfully complete the breath alcohol test. It is recommended that changes are made to both of the instruments, the techniques used and the legislation, to minimize the number of breath alcohol testing failures and to reduce the variability of the results.
