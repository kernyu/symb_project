We report the case of unusually early infection by Plasmodium vivax after autologous bone marrow transplantation in a 20-year-old female from Bangladesh affected by acute myelogenous leukemia in first complete remission (CR) who underwent autologous bone marrow transplantation in our center. During the aplastic phase she became febrile; broad spectrum antibiotics and antifungal therapy were without effect. Blood smears were examined and Plasmodium vivax was detected despite a very low number of red cells infected. Cloroquine therapy for 3 days was given followed by primaquine for 2 weeks in order to avoid possible cloroquine resistance. Fever disappeared within 48 h from initial treatment and the patient was discharged having completely recovered at day +30. Primary malaria infection in non-endemic areas is a very rare event. In this particular case, after excluding primary infection or blood transfusion-mediated infection, malaria was attributed to a recrudescence of a primary unidentified infection.
