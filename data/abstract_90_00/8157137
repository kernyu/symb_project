Antibiotics, in addition to killing or inhibiting the growth of microorganisms, may also affect the immune response in many ways. Such effects may be clinically relevant especially when an impairment of immunological functions is seen. This study was designed to analyse the influence of various groups of antibiotics on the host defence system by using different tests in vitro on human or animal cells and in vivo on an animal model. At the same time we analysed the antimicrobial effectiveness of the same antibiotics on over 2800 bacterial strains isolated from our clinical material. Preliminary findings show that a correlation exists between the effect of antibiotics on the immune response, especially the humoral response, and the appearance of resistance in bacteria to these antibiotics.
