Since chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium falciparum (CRPF) has emerged in Nigeria, we monitored the susceptibility of the parasite strain to a standard chloroquine (C25) dose in our Children's Emergency Unit. Chloroquine (CQ) is the drug of choice for malaria chemotherapy in Nigeria. The WHO 7-day in vivo evaluation and Rieckmann's microtitre technique (in vitro test) were used. 33 children of mean age 4.9 years were enrolled in the study. 27 (81.8%) of the in vitro cultures were successful. 16 (59.3%) of the successful isolates still showed schizogony at CQ concentration of 5.7 pmol/well and above. 28 (84.8%) of the children completed the in vivo study. 15 (53.6%) were parasitaemic on day 7 and/or day 14 and were regarded as parasitologic failures. The isolates from 14 of these children showed corresponding in vitro resistance of CQ concentrations equal to or above 5.7 pmol/well. The proportion of RIII (= 13.3%) appears to have increased as compared to 5.9% recorded in 1987. We conclude that there appears to be a good correlation between in vivo evaluation of parasitologic failures (53.6%) and in vitro resistance (59.3%). It thus appears that CRPF is definitely increasing in South-Eastern Nigeria. This can be expected not only to complicate malaria chemotherapy in the Children's Emergency Unit of the University of Calabar Teaching Hospital, but will contribute immensely to the deterioration of malaria therapy and control in Nigeria.
