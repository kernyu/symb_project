In patients with AIDS and recurrent oropharyngeal candidosis results of biotyping and serotyping were compared with antifungal susceptibility testing. Biotype B1 was found predominantly with 44.3% from 169 C. albicans isolates. Serotype A was seen in 150/169 C. albicans isolates. No close correlation between high MIC values (> or = 25 micrograms/ml) for C. albicans isolates against fluconazole nor a change to a particular biotype or serotype has been observed in recurrences of oral candidosis.
