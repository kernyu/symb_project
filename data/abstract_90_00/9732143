Sixteen selected isolates of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia varied in susceptibility to the combined phagocytic/serum bactericidal activity of fresh defibrinated human blood (65 vol%). Four representative isolates (X1, X11, X25, and X50), which differed in susceptibility to cefepime, ceftazidime, rifampin, and timentin, were subjected to checkerboard microtiter broth dilution tests involving combinations of cefepime plus timentin, ceftazidime plus ofloxacin, cotrimoxazole plus timentin, rifampin plus polymyxin B, and rifampin plus polymyxin B nonapeptide; all combinations yielded additive or synergistic effects against all four strains. Unexpectedly, the combination of cefepime plus timentin was bactericidally active against the two cefepime-resistant isolates. This finding was substantiated by blood/broth plus combined antimicrobial drug assays. Cefepime plus timentin effectively killed all four test strains. Ofloxacin combined with ceftazidime was bactericidally active against the test strains, including two isolates (X11, X50) with intermediate ofloxacin sensitivity. Cotrimoxazole plus timentin in blood, but not in broth, was bactericidal for the timentin-resistant isolate X25. As expected, various triple combinations of chemotherapeutic agents in blood and broth revealed polymyxin B plus rifampin, regardless of the third combination partner, to exert bactericidal activity against all test strains. Similarly, rifampin combined with ofloxacin and ceftazidime was bactericidally active in blood and broth. The observation that timentin combined with cefepime was effective against cefepime-resistant strains of S. maltophilia might prove of clinical relevance with regard to chemotherapy of nosocomial infections due to multiple-antibiotic resistant strains of this opportunistic pathogen.
