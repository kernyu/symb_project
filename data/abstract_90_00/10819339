CONTEXT: Children with chronic otitis media are at risk for nonsusceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae (NSP) infection. If these children undergo ventilating tube placement, there is an opportunity to culture middle ear fluid and the nasopharynx to determine carriage of NSP. OBJECTIVE: To determine the incidence of NSP carriage, NSP antibiotic susceptibility and risk factors for NSP carriage in children with chronic otitis media undergoing tube placement. DESIGN AND SETTING: Prospective cohort study in an academic medical center with recruitment of patients from an otolaryngology private practice and clinic. PATIENTS: Children < 18 years of age undergoing tube placement for chronic otitis media. INTERVENTIONS: Myringotomy and tube placement, with culture of middle ear fluid and nasopharynx. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The incidence of NSP cultured from the middle ears and nasopharynx of recruited subjects with the use of the minimum inhibitory concentration break points for penicillin susceptibility recommended by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards. RESULTS: S. pneumoniae was identified in at least 1 site from 23 of 300 study subjects (7.6%); of these 23, 12 case subjects (52.2%) harbored NSP. Of the risk factors assessed by preoperative questionnaire, only younger age was associated with NSP colonization (P < 0.0001). Of the six oral cephalosporins studied, cefpodoxime and cefuroxime showed good in vitro activity against S. pneumoniae isolates with intermediate penicillin resistance. CONCLUSIONS: Children with chronic otitis media undergoing tube placement may carry NSP and provide a means of monitoring the incidence of NSP and antibiotic susceptibilities for children with ear infections in their communities. Younger age is a risk factor for NSP carriage in this population.
