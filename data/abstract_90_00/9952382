In 1994, the Pediatric AIDS Clinical Trials Group (PACTG) Protocol 076 demonstrated a two-thirds reduction of perinatal human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 transmission with zidovudine chemoprophylaxis. However, zidovudine alone does not fully suppress HIV replication, and chemoprophylaxis with zidovudine alone might select for zidovudine-resistant viral variants, decreasing the efficacy of zidovudine prophylaxis and affecting future responses to combined antiretroviral regimens. Sixty-two HIV-infected pregnant women consecutively enrolled in the ongoing Swiss HIV and Pregnancy Study were prospectively evaluated for the presence or development of zidovudine resistance by analysis of codon 215 of the reverse transcriptase gene. Six women (9.6%) harbored a codon T215Y/F mutation, which is associated with high-level resistance to zidovudine. Postnatal evaluation was completed in all children of mothers harboring the mutation. None was HIV-infected. The observed prevalence of codon 215 mutations of 9.6% raises important concerns regarding the future use of the PACTG 076 regimen.
