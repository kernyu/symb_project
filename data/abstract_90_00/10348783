Antimicrobial resistance was characterized for 14 strains of Streptococcus mitis. HinfI restriction fragment length mapping of gyrA PCR amplicons from three ciprofloxacin-resistant isolates correlated with mutations associated with such resistance in other organisms. By using PCR, seven erythromycin-resistant strains were found to possess either the mef or ermB gene. Hybridization revealed tet(M) in seven tetracycline-resistant isolates.
