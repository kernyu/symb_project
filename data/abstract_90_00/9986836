Fifty-six isolates of four Aeromonas species, which have been documented as causative agents of human infections or isolated from human clinical specimens, were subjected to antimicrobial susceptibility testing using a MicroScan WalkAway conventional (overnight incubation) gram-negative panel. The four species tested and the number of isolates of each were as follows: Aeromonas jandaei, 17; A. schubertii, 12; A. trota, 15; and A. veronii biotype veronii, 12. All isolates of A. trota were susceptible to all antimicrobial agents tested, except cefazolin (20% of isolates were resistant) and cefoxitin (13% of isolates were resistant). All isolates of A. schubertii and A. veronii biotype veronii, as well as 88% of A. jandaei isolates, were resistant to ampicillin. Resistance to ampicillin-sulbactam ranged from 25% of A. schubertii strains to 100% of A. veronii biotype veronii strains. Cefazolin resistance ranged from 17% of A. veronii biotype veronii isolates to 59% of A. jandaei isolates. Imipenem resistance was detected in 65% of A. jandaei strains and 67% of A. veronii biotype veronii strains. A. jandaei displayed resistance to piperacillin and ticarcillin in 53 and 71% of the isolates, respectively. A. veronii biotype veronii strains were 100% susceptible to piperacillin and 100% resistant to ticarcillin. These antibiogram data may be useful in establishing the identification of these four species when members of the genus Aeromonas are isolated from human clinical sources.
