Enterobacter species have emerged as important nosocomial pathogens. Common reservoirs for these organisms include wounds and the gastrointestinal, urinary, and respiratory tracts. Enterobacter bacteremia typically occurs in patients with long-standing underlying illnesses who received antimicrobial agents before their bacteremia. The wide use of broad-spectrum antibiotics has contributed to the increased prominence of Enterobacter infections. Enterobacter species have a propensity to emerge resistant to the antibiotic therapy administered. Plasmid analysis, restriction endonuclease analysis of total cellular DNA, pulsed-field electrophoresis, and ribotyping can be valuable in investigating the spread of antibiotic-resistant strains.
