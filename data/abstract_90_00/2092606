The Authors review, on the basis of their experience, the literature data concerning chemo-antibiotic prophylaxis in gynaecological surgery. Prophylaxis is widely employed although some important aspects are still under evaluation: bacterial selection and resistance, benefit in case of abdominal hysterectomy or elective Cesarean section, risk of pseudomembranous colitis. The most effective drugs are Piperacillin/Mezlocillin given in a single dose preoperatively. The same drugs are useful in the treatment of postsurgical infections.
