The sequences of a conserved region in the A subunit of DNA gyrase corresponding to the quinolone resistance-determining region were determined for nine mycobacterial species and were compared. Although the nucleotide sequences were highly conserved, they clearly differentiated one species from another. The results of the phylogenetic analysis based on the sequences of the quinolone resistance-determining regions were compared with those provided by the 16S rRNA sequences. Deduced amino acid sequences were identical within the nine species except for amino acid 83, which was frequently involved in acquired resistance to quinolones in many genera, including mycobacteria. The presence at position 83 of an alanine for seven mycobacterial species (M. tuberculosis, M. bovis BCG, M. leprae, M. avium, M. kansasii, M. chelonae, and M. smegmatis) and of a serine for the two remaining mycobacterial species (M. fortuitum and M. aurum) correlated well with the MICs of ofloxacin for both groups of species, suggesting the role of this residue in intrinsic susceptibility to quinolones in mycobacteria.
