Six open reading frames (ORFs) of unknown function from Saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosome XV, three from the left and three from the right arm, were deleted in two diploid strains by the short flanking homology method (Wach et al., 1994). Transformants were selected as Geneticin (G418)-resistant colonies and correct integration of the kanMX4 cassette was checked by colony PCR. Following sporulation of the diploids, tetrads were dissected and scored for the segregation of the G418-resistant marker. We have developed a widely applicable method for the construction of gap repair plasmids to obtain the cognate clones for each of the disrupted ORFs. The 5'- and 3'-flanks of the ORF in question are linked by a unique restriction endonuclease. When the plasmid is cut at this site it can be used to obtain, by selection for the appropriate antibiotic resistance, long flanking homology (LFH) cassettes containing the cognate clone or the disrupted allele. The LFH cassette containing the cognate clone or the disrupted allele can be released from the gap-repaired plasmid by cutting at the inserted flanking restriction sites. One of the six ORFs (YOR319w) corresponds to an essential gene whose product is part of the spliceosome complex. Haploid as well as homozygous and heterozygous diploid disruptant strains for each of the five non-essential ORFs were subjected to growth test on different media at 15 degrees C, 30 degrees C and 37 degrees C. Disruption of YOR322c causes osmotically sensitive growth on YEPD at 37 degrees C and the product of YOL091w appears to play a role in sporulation since the homozygous diploid disruptant has lost the ability to sporulate.
