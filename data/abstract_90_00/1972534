Using a variety of mutagenic methods, we have generated a series of ciprofloxacin-resistant mutants derived from Escherichia coli strains which overproduce the DNA gyrase A protein. Many of these mutants are found to overexpress a 60 kD protein which is shown to be highly homologous in terms of N-terminal amino acid sequence to the E. coli heat-shock protein, GroEL. Other evidence confirms that the 60 kD protein is unrelated to DNA gyrase and is similar, but not identical, to GroEL.
