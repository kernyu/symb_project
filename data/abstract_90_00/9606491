Antibiotic susceptibility of 1479 Vibrio cholerae 01 strains isolated from humans between 1991 and 1995 was studied. The antibiotics used belonged to different chemical groups. The assay method was that of serial dilutions in solid media. The isolates showed high susceptibility to tetracyclines, gentamicin, erythromycin, rifampicin, ampicillin, carbenicillin and cefazolin. The susceptibility to kanamycin and monomycin was moderate and that to chloramphenicol, streptomycin and polymixin B was low. The time and area peculiarities of the circulating cultures were observed. The susceptibility of the isolates was either changing or unchanging. The constant susceptibility levels were detected with respect to gentamicin, erythromycin, monomycin, kanamycin, streptomycin and polymyxin B. The susceptibility changing in time was shown with respect to tetracyclines, rifampicin and chloramphenicol. A gradual increase in the resistance to betalactams with greater numbers of the plasmid resistance pattern strains was recorded. Regular surveillance of the changes in the V.cholerae 01 antibiotic susceptibility is needed to timely correct the treatment and prophylaxis regimens.
