Bacteremia due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is most likely to occur in compromised patients with prolonged hospitalization who are receiving antibiotics, particularly beta-lactam ones. The clinical picture of MRSA bacteremia is almost the same as that of bacteremia due to methicillin-sensitive S. aureus. There seems to be no significant difference in prognosis between the two types of staphylococcal bacteremia when patients in the same disease category are considered. Vancomycin is at present the only antibiotic for the treatment of MRSA bacteremia. It is therefore important to use the drug adequately so as to prevent its adverse effects and delay the appearance of resistant organisms.
