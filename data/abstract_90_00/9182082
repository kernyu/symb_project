Cefuroxime axetil is a cefuroxime ester that can be administered by mouth. Two dosage forms (tablets and granules) have been developed for oral administration. We evaluated the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of these forms in an open cross-over study involving 12 healthy volunteers receiving single doses of 250 mg. The bioavailability of the two forms was different, the observed peak concentration and time-concentration curve values of the tablet form being, respectively, 39 and 27% higher than those of the granule form. However, ex vivo studies of serum bactericidal activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae showed no significant differences between the two formulations. This is in keeping with the fact that the bactericidal activity of samples from only six subjects gave evaluable data for Haemophilus influenzae; although small differences were found between the two formulations, further investigations are required. The pharmacodynamic approach is becoming an essential element in determining the equivalence of antibiotic dosage forms.
