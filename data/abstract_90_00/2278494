Data on the amounts, nomenclature and trends in the dynamics of the use of chemotherapeutic drugs in medicine and agriculture in the RSFSR in 1971-1983 were examined. It was shown that the amounts of their use for these purposes permanently increased. The levels of the use of antibacterial drugs in agriculture markedly exceeded (1.5 to 9 times in different years) those in medicine. On the whole tetracyclines, penicillins and nitrofurans were the drugs most widely used in both medicine and agriculture. The proportions of their use amounted to 39.7-61.2, 9.8-28.1 and 8.3-17.9 per cent, respectively. The use of chloramphenicol and aminoglycosides was somewhat lower, i.e. 10.6-15.8 and 6.5-9.2 per cent, respectively. The proportion of the use of the drugs of other groups did not exceed 2.1 per cent. It was stated that the chemotherapeutic drugs used in medicine for treatment of patients were widely used for nonmedical purposes. Among them are tetracyclines, chloramphenicol, aminoglycosides and lately nitrofurans. The levels of the use of some chemotherapeutic drugs and variability in their MICs for the Shigella populations tested were compared. It was concluded that the level of the drug use was not the only factor influencing development of the resistance in Shigella spp.
