In a collection of 43 indole-positive Klebsiella clinical isolates, which were initially identified as Klebsiella oxytoca, there were 18 isolates which exhibited a pattern characteristic of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) resistance. This study aimed to confirm their identity by biochemical tests and by PCR and to determine the genetic basis for their resistance to the beta-lactams and broad-spectrum cephalosporins. Chromosomal beta-lactamase genes were analyzed by PCR, and plasmid-mediated beta-lactamase genes were analyzed by conjugation and transformation. There were 39 isolates which grew on melezitose but failed to grow on 3-hydroxybutyrate, confirming them as K. oxytoca. PCR analysis of their beta-lactamase genes divided these isolates into two groups, the bla(OXY-1) group and the bla(OXY-2) group. Each group had beta-lactamases with different isoelectric points; the bla(OXY-1) group had beta-lactamases with isoelectric points at 7.2, 7.8, 8.2, and 8.8, and the more common bla(OXY-2) group had beta-lactamases with pIs at 5.2, 5.4 (TEM-1), 5.7, 5.9, 6.4, and 6.8. A pI of 5.2 was the most frequently detected and accounted for 59% of all the bla(OXY-2) beta-lactamases. Hyperproduction of clavulanate-inhibited chromosomal beta-lactamases was detected in 17 K. oxytoca isolates, resulting in an ESBL phenotype. K. oxytoca isolates having a plasmid-mediated genetic basis for their ESBL phenotype were not found, confirming that, in K. oxytoca, plasmids are rarely involved in conferring resistance to the newer cephalosporins. Four isolates proved to be isolates of K. planticola in which the beta-lactamase genes failed to react with the primers used in the PCR. One K. planticola isolate contained a transferable plasmid harboring the SHV-5 beta-lactamase gene and showed an ESBL phenotype, while the other non-ESBL K. planticola isolates contained chromosomal beta-lactamases with isoelectric points at 7.2, 7.7, and 7.9 plus 7.2.
