The authors report a case of massive wear of carbon fiber-reinforced polyethylene used as an insert in a knee prosthesis. The finding, which was studied under a scanning electron microscope, in agreement with mechanical resistance and laboratory testing reported in the literature, confirms that this composite material (poly-two) is not more advantageous to use that ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene in terms of wear, despite favorable experimental premises.
