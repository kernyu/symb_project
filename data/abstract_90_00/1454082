Yersinia pseudotuberculosis strain 140-P isolated from soil in the Far East was found to harbour an R-plasmid different from the plasmids that had been isolated from the bacteria previously. A new R-plasmid pLD140 is conjugation proficient and codes for the cellular resistance to streptomycin, tetracycline and sulfonamides. The plasid belongs to incompatibility group IncP. Its restriction endonucleases BamHI and SalI profile is different from the ones of the plasmids belonging to the RP4 family.
