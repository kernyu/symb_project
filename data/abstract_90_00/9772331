The increased incidence of tubercular diseases in industrialized countries appears to be due to several factors, including development of resistance to the most commonly used specific chemotherapeutic substances, unsuitable control programmes, HIV infection, the increased influx of immigrants, and homelessness. Different forms of cutaneous tuberculosis are caused by different species of mycobacteria (e.g., Mycobacterium tuberculosis, M. bovis, M. avium). Determining the species of mycobacteria is relevant when disease is suspected to be linked to the type of employment of the patient, mainly because the clinical features do not always indicate which species is the cause of the infection. Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MT) usually infects through the lung, but in rare cases can penetrate the skin or mucous membranes. Skin transmission can be exogenous by inoculation, or endogenous by diffusion (lymphatic or hematic) or by contiguity. The immunologic status of the patient is a crucial factor which influences the clinical variants and the course of disease itself. Here we report a case of an illegal immigrant who presented with a bilateral, symmetrical ulcer on the neck.
