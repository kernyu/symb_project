Of 121 recent clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 22% were resistant to ciprofloxacin, 50% to ofloxacin and 69% to pefloxacin. Resistance to these drugs was commonest among urinary isolates (P less than 0.03). Cross-resistance was noted between fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides or beta-lactams.
