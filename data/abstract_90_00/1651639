The data on the influence of imuthiol on humoral and cell-mediated immunity developing after immunization against tetanus are presented. Experiments were made on 166 guinea pigs with the use of imuthiol in doses of 25 and 125 mg/kg and tetanus toxoid in doses of 1.5 and 6.0 BU/kg. The dynamic observation of the animals lasted 30 days. The data of the passive hemagglutination test and the neutralization test indicated that imuthiol had considerable influence on the formation of humoral immunity. The results of skin reactions with tetanin, in vitro cell reactions, as well as resistance tests, showed that imuthiol exerted influence on delayed hypersensitivity, the mechanisms of cell-mediated resistance and survival after challenge. The data on the influence of imuthiol could be registered even at early stages after immunization, the immunostimulating action of the preparation reaching its maximum with tetanus toxoid used in a dose of 6.0 BU/kg and imuthiol, in a dose of 125 mg/kg.
