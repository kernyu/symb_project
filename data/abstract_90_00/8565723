Sulperazone (SLP), a combination of sulbactam (beta-lactamase inhibitor) with cefoperazone (CFP), was studied in vitro for its sensitivity to multi-resistant strains of bacteria isolated from burn wounds. The results showed that the sensitive rate of gram-negative bacteria to SLP was 77.3% (n = 163), higher than that of CFP (45.0%, n = 169) (P < 0.01). The rate of pseudomonas aeruginosa which was common among the gram-negative bacteria was 88.9% (n = 45), much higher than that of CFP (71.7%, n = 46) (P < 0.05). The rate of bacterium anitratum was 100%, and it was resistant to CFP (P < 0.01). The sensitive rate of gram-positive bacteria to SLP was 37.5% (n = 128) but to CFP was 24.6% (n = 126) (P < 0.05). The rate of staphylococcus aureus which was common in gram-positive bacteria was 42.6% (n = 61), much higher than that of CFP (21.3%, n = 61) (P < 0.05). It is indicated that sulbactam inhibits most beta-lactamases produced by common bacterial pathogens and makes antibiotics restore the sensitivity to resistant strains. Sulperazone is promising in the treatment of burn infection.
