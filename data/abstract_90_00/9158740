Comparison of several cell wall-related properties of the ATCC 9790 strain and the R40 strain, a penicillin-resistant, PBP5 overproducing strain, and Rev14, a penicillin-hypersensitive, PBP5-deficient strain, is consistent with a role of the genetic element, psr, in the global regulation of lysozyme sensitivity, autolytic capacity, and wall-rhamnose-containing polysaccharide content. These parameters appear to be independently regulated by a system that involves psr in a currently unknown manner.
