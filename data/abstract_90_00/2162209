In the presence of H2O2, solutions of Fe2+ were applied to brain homogenate and isolated myelin from adult SWV control mice and the shiverer dysmyelinating mutant mouse as a source of a reactive oxygen species (Fenton reaction). Under these conditions, lipid peroxidation was initiated and measured as thiobarbituric acid-reactive oxidation products (TBAR). This was accompanied by 85% inhibition of myelin-associated Na+,K(+)-ATPase and 25% inhibition of 5'-nucleotidase. In contrast, CNPase activity was not altered. Studies on the shiverer mutant brain revealed that in spite of hypomyelination and prevalence of premature, myelin-like membranes in the homogenate, the myelin-related enzymes reacted as normal enzymes to peroxidation. Differences in the resistance of Na+,K(+)-ATPase to peroxidation in the brain homogenate and myelin suggest that the myelin enzyme is extremely sensitive to reactive oxygen toxicity.
