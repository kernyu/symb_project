We found a Factor (factor T) in aged mixtures of tungstate and phosphate which greatly enhanced the antibacterial effects of beta-lactams upon methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Factor T suppressed penicillinase production and the amount of penicillin-binding protein-2' in the membrane fraction, thus sensitizing MRSA strains to beta-lactams. In addition, Factor T caused a metachromatic reaction and prolonged the blood coagulation time, indicating that it is a heparin-like polyanion. Since Factor T becomes ineffective in the presence of a polycation, a charge interaction may play an important role in the enhancing effect. One possibility is that Factor T non-specifically inhibits several anion-sensitive enzymes. Factor T inhibited several nucleotide-interacting enzymes, but not most serum enzymes.
