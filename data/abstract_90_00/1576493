Aspects of selective decontamination as an antibiotic prophylaxis in general surgery are discussed with respect to the respiratory tract and wound infection. The high rate of nosocomial infection encountered in surgical patients, who experience up to 71 per cent of all such infection, is considered. The infection rate increases to 70-80 per cent after 1 week in the surgical intensive care unit, while the infection-related mortality rate rises to up to 60 per cent. The endogenous origin of nosocomial infection suggests the importance of maintaining colonization resistance to prevent colonization with Gram-negative micro-organisms, especially using selective decontamination which eliminates potentially pathogenic micro-organisms while leaving colonization resistance intact. Selective decontamination has proved effective in decreasing infection rates by 50-80 per cent, and is especially successful in respiratory tract infection. Possible adverse effects and future indications for selective decontamination are discussed.
