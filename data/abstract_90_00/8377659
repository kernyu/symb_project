The survival abilities of methicillin-resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus were compared with those of sensitive strains. Absorbent cotton was inoculated with 10(8) cells of each strain tested and stored at 30% humidity at 25 degrees C. The numbers of cells of sensitive strains decreased significantly to well below those of resistant strains after 4 weeks, while cells of resistant strains remained above 10(3) after 14 weeks.
