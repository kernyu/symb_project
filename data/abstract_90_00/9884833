Fifty-five Staphylococcus haemolyticus specimens isolated from patients and neonatal intensive care unit staff were tested for susceptibility to 12 antimicrobial agents. There were 34 multidrug-resistant isolates which were resistant to oxacillin, ampicillin, cefazolin, cefmetazole, imipenem, and gentamicin. These isolates had a higher frequency of resistance to tobramicin and ofloxacin, and relatively high MICs (2 to 4 micrograms/mL) for vancomycin, although none of the isolates were vancomycin resistant. To investigate hospital-acquired colonization and infection by multiresistant S. haemolyticus, we examined all isolates by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) after SmaI and SstII digestion, and detected an endemic PFGE pattern in multiresistant isolates. The results suggested that local spread of multiresistant S. haemolyticus was hospital acquired, and that the hospital staffs functioned as a reservoir.
