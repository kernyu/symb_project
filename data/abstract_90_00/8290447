In early 1983 we experienced a small scale epidemic of Staphylococcus aureus coagulase type IV in the premature infants unit. Children had bacteraemia or impetigo. The microorganism was resistant to methicillin, erythromycin and lincomycin and was susceptible to tetracycline, chloramphenicol and cefmetazole. The results of coagulase typing and antimicrobial sensitivities indicated that these cases represented nosocomial infection with MRSA. The source and route of the infection were investigated, and measures were taken to prevent bacterial spread from carriers and to keep instruments and environments clean. As the source of infection was not identified, we tried wiping the body surface of the premature infants with a diluted IsodineR solution (10% povidone-iodine; 1:100 dilution) in order to prevent colonization of the microorganism on the body surface. As a result, no additional MRSA infection occurred in the premature infant unit. During the subsequent 6 years of frequent surveys of carriers and wiping the appropriate body surface with diluted IsodineR solution we have had no recurrence of MRSA. None of the premature infants wiped with IsodineR solution showed any objective abnormalities, although laboratory testing disclosed an elevated blood iodine level and a transient mild reduction of T4 in some infants.
