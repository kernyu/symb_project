Pseudomonas aeruginosa has been regarded as one of the most stubborn pathogens that easily acquire resistance to various antimicrobial agents. Recently, several clinical isolates that have acquired multiple-resistance to carbapenems, fluoroquinolones, and newly developed aminoglycosides such as amikacin have been reported. Thus, the "drug-resistant P. aeruginosa" was designated as a "class 4 pathogen" in the new "Law Concerning the Prevention of Infectious Diseases and Medical Care for Patients with Infections" in Japan. It is generally considered that no medical facility can escape from severe attack by both multiple-drug resistant gram-positive cocci such as MRSA and gram-negative rods including P. aeruginosa in the 21st century. Therefore, emergency countermeasures should be anticipated to prevent further proliferation of these multiple-drug resistant pathogens.
