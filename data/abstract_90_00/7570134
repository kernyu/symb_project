Data on bacterial resistance in patients seen by general practitioners are usually not readily available. The objective of this paper is to present the antimicrobial resistance pattern of bacteria isolated from patients seen by private practitioners in the Klang Valley. A total of 18 clinics participated in this study. From mid August 1991 to end of June 1993, 2,823 specimens were received. Throat swabs and urine specimens constituted 56% of all the specimens. A large proportion of the specimens (55%) yielded no growth or just normal flora. The common bacteria encountered were Staphylococcus aureus (18.4%), Escherichia coli (16.2%), Klebsiella spp (13.7%) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (9.3%). The S. aureus strains were mainly isolated from wound, pus and ear swabs. Not one out of the 218 strains tested was resistant to methicillin. In vitro susceptibility tests showed that 91% were resistant to penicillin while 23% were resistant to tetracycline and 13% to erythromycin. Eighty-two percent of the E. coli were isolated from urine. It was also the most common isolate from urine. Fifty percent of these strains were resistant to ampicillin, 33% to cotrimoxazole, 17% to cephalothin, 21% to ampicillin-sulbactam, 18% to amoxycillin-clavulanic acid while only 2.3% were resistant to nalidixic acid and nitrofurantoin and none to cefuroxime. Generally the gram negative bacilli encountered in general practice are less resistant to the third generation cephalosporins and aminoglycosides when compared to the hospital strains.
