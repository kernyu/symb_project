Annual epidemics of bacillary dysentery have been a public health problem in Burundi for the last 14 years. Recent civil unrest, resulting in the displacement of large numbers of people into refugee settlements, has aggravated the situation. We report the results of a nationwide, health-centre based, sentinel site survey to check the drug resistance of Shigella dysenteriae type 1 (Sd1), the causal organism of such epidemics. Shigella spp. (of which 97% were Sd1) were isolated from 73% of the 126 specimens collected from six main sites around the country. There was no difference in culture results from fresh and frozen stool specimens. Overall Sd1 resistance to commonly available antibiotics (sulfamethoxazole + trimethoprim, ampicillin, tetracycline, and chloramphenicol) varied from 77% to 99% and was fairly uniformly distributed over the country. All Sd1 isolates were susceptible to newer drugs, such as ciprofloxacin and ceftriaxone. Resistance to nalidixic acid, the current first line of treatment for bacillary dysentery in Burundi, varied from 8% to 83% in the different sentinel sites; global resistance was 57%.
