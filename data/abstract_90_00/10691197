In a rabbit model of meningitis caused by a pneumococcus highly resistant to penicillin (MIC, 4 microg/ml), meropenem, a broad-spectrum carbapenem, was bactericidal (-0.48+/-0.14 deltalog10 cfu/ml h) and slightly superior to ceftriaxone (-0.34+/-0.23 deltalog10 cfu/ml x h) and vancomycin (-0.39+/-0.19 deltalog10 cfu/ml x h). Although the combination of vancomycin with ceftriaxone was significantly more active than ceftriaxone alone (-0.55+/-0.19 deltalog10 cfu/ml x h), only an insignificant gain was observed by the addition of vancomycin to meropenem (-0.55+/-0.28 deltalog10 cfu/ml x h).
