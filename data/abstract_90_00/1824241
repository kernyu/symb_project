Two auxotrophic mutants of S. rimosus and S. griseus were obtained through nitrosoguanidine treatment. The equal volume of two protoplast containing 10(9)/ml were mixed and put in the fusion chamber of Shimadzu somatic hybridizer-SSH-C11. Fifteen seconds after protoplast pearl chains were formed through electrophoresis under high-frequency electric field (800 V/cm 1 MHz), it was turned into high DC pulse field (6 kV/cm) for 20 seconds immediately to make the protoplast to be fused. Colonies were raised on regeneration medium R3. 34971 colonies were selected and transferred to basic medium containing two antibiotics. Nine of them were prototrophic fusant with double resistance. They had good biological characteristics of parent strain, such as faster growth rate, higher productivity and stronger microbial activity. Bioautographic result showed that it can produce bioactive characteristics that their parents do not have.
