The development of resistance accounts for therapy failure in the majority of advanced cases of neuroblastoma in children. A new transplantable murine C-1300 neuroblastoma cell line was developed in vitro, by repeated exposure of a sensitive cell line to increasing, but sublethal, doses of Homoharringtonine (HHT). The ED50 of the highly resistant cells for HHT, using a standard agar colony assay, is 480 ng/ml, compared with 13 ng/ml for the sensitive parental line. The resistant cells have cross-resistance to a number of other agents, including adriamycin, vinca alkaloids, melphalan, and CCNU. Western blot analysis revealed progressive increases in P-glycoprotein, parallel to the graded development of resistance with a 29-fold elevation in the highest resistant cells. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) indicated that resistant cells have a significantly lower uptake of HHT than parental sensitive cells. cyclosporine A (CsA) and dipyridamole (DPM) could modulate the acquired resistance and completely restore the cytotoxic effects of HHT and adriamycin as determined by the clonogenic assay. The reversal of resistance by CsA and DPM was dose dependent. With the relative low toxicity of dipyridamole and CsA in doses required for modulation of resistance, these agents may be candidates for clinical utilization in chemotherapy of resistant neuroblastoma.
