A comparative study of cefixime (CFIX), a new oral cephem antibiotic, was carried out at the Department of Urology, Nagoya University Hospital and its four affiliated hospitals to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of two dosage regimens of CFIX, given either in twice daily doses (BID group) or once daily dose (UID group), in the treatment of acute uncomplicated cystitis. Forty six female patients (BID group) were administered the daily dose of 200 mg in two divided doses for 3 days, 30 female patients (UID group) were administered 200 mg once daily for 3 days. The clinical efficacy was evaluated in 33 cases from the BID group and in 22 cases from the UID group, respectively, according to the criteria recommended by the Japan UTI Committee. In the BID group, the clinical efficacy was evaluated as excellent in 18 cases, moderate in 13 and poor in 2, with an overall clinical effectiveness rate of 94%. In the UID group, it was evaluated as excellent in 9 cases, moderate in 12 and poor in 1, with an overall clinical effectiveness rate of 96%. Safety was monitored in 71 patients, and only one case of stomatitis was seen in the UID group. This findings suggest that 200 mg once daily dosing regimen of cefixime is as effective as 100 mg twice daily dosing regimen in treatment of acute uncomplicated cystitis, and is well tolerated in terms of safety.
