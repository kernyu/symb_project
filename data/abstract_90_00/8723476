A novel, probably chromosomally encoded, aminoglycoside phosphotransferase gene was cloned on a 2,996-bp PstI fragment from Pseudomonas aeruginosa and designated aph (3')-IIb. It coded for a protein of 268 amino acids that showed 51.7% amino acid identity with APH (3')-II [APH(3') is aminoglycoside-3' phosphotransferase] from Tn5. Two other open reading frames on the cloned fragment showed homology to a signal-transducing system in P. aeruginosa.
