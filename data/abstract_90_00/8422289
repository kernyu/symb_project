In the search for new therapeutic concepts in lung cancer chemotherapy, suramin, a potential anticancer drug which evades multidrug resistance, was tested in vitro on 25 lung-derived cell lines, either non-tumorigenic cells, or established cell lines from five different tumour types. Suramin treatment resulted in a time- and dose-dependent decrease in [3H]thymidine incorporation, except in one adenocarcinoma cell line where DNA synthesis was highly stimulated. [3H]Leucine incorporation was less affected, indicating that suramin acted cytostatically rather than cytotoxically. Our results show that suramin affected DNA synthesis of the different types of lung derived cells, including non-tumorigenic and tumour cell lines, to a similar extent.
