The susceptibility of 46 pneumococcal isolates collected during October 1989 to May 1995 from National Taiwan University Hospital and Taipei Municipal Yang Ming Hospital was studied. Among these isolates, the resistant rate of penicillin G was 21.7%; the penicillin G-resistant strains were more frequently resistant than the penicillin-sensitive strains to other beta-lactam antimicrobial drugs. The minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) of penicillin G for all isolates were equal to, or one dilution higher than, minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs). Three strains were false positive for penicillin resistance among isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae screened with oxacillin. On the other hand, resistance to penicillin G was often independent of resistance to erythromycin. Vancomycin was the most active agent tested.
