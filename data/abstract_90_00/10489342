A chimeric gene encoding a fusion protein consisting of the DNA-binding domain of the immediate-early (IE) protein of pseudorabies virus (PRV) and a tail-truncated VP16 of herpes simplex virus 1, lacking the transcription activation domain, has been shown to repress transcription of the PRV IE gene, resulting in the inhibition of PRV growth in vitro. To assess the antiviral potential of the fusion protein in vivo, transgenic mice containing the chimeric gene under the control of the virus- and interferon-inducible Mx 1 promoter were generated. A transgenic mouse line showed marked resistance to PRV infection when the mice were challenged intranasally with PRV. Inhibition of PRV replication was also observed in monolayers of embryonic cells prepared from the transgenic mice. In the cells infected with PRV, transcription of the PRV IE gene was repressed. The present results indicate that the chimeric gene is able to exert a significant antiviral effect against PRV infection in vivo.
