Three patients with corneal ulcers had gram-positive cocci isolated on initial scrapings. There was no response to topical fortified aminoglycosides or cephalosporins. Cultures revealed methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus that was sensitive only to topical vancomycin eye drops. Because the microbiologic spectrum is similar, vancomycin should be considered instead of a cephalosporin in the treatment of corneal ulcers to cover methicillin-resistant S. aureus and S. epidermidis.
