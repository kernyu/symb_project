Suspected tropical malaria is an acute emergency. Immediate effective pharmacological treatment is of the essence. As in the case of prevention, various antimalarials are now available for treatment. Complicated tropical malaria requires treatment in hospital and intensive monitoring. The risk of infection and serious illness leading to a fatal outcome can be considerably reduced by suitable chemoprophylaxis or the use of stand-by medication for self-treatment, which, however, must be matched to resistance zones and the incidence of the four species of Plasmodium, in particular Plasmodium falciparum.
