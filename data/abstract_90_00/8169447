The present study is the first report of the epidemiological survey carried out as a part of the Praziquantel resistance project which is one of the projects of Schistosomiasis Research Project (SRP) in Egypt. The results of the study, which has been carried out in 3 villages, revealed that praziquantel is effective as an antischistosomal drugs and reduced egg count significantly. However at the end of the study some cases remained infected in spite of the three treatment regimens. Several factors can be responsible, among them is the presence of resistance strains, which will only be elucidated in the subsequent steps of the project, when identification of resistant strains in experimental animals will be carried out.
