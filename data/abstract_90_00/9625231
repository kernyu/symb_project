Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has become a frequent cause of nosocomial infection, its increasing prevalence posing serious therapeutic and infection control problems within the hospital environment. MRSA is a major challenge to the burn patient, with potential to cause significant morbidity and mortality. Burn patients have been shown to become colonised and infected more readily than other patient groups. Extensive burn injuries are particularly susceptible to infection as a result of the disruption of the normal skin barrier and accompanying depression of immune responses. Extended hospitalisation and antibiotic therapy have been identified as additional risk factors for MRSA carriage and infection. Microbial surveillance, epidemiological studies and the introduction of strict infection control regimes can reduce the prevalence of MRSA but may be insufficient for eradication or prevention of outbreak situations. Recognition of the clinical importance of MRSA to the burn patient highlights the need to take appropriate measures to minimise transmission and infection in this vulnerable group of patients.
