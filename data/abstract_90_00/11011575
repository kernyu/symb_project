Aerobic microbes in ENT departments were studied. The following strains were isolated: Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Enterococcus, Acinetobacter, Klebsiella, Pseudomonas, Flavobacter, Citrobacter, Enterobacter, Escherichia, Aspergillus, Candida. 54.5% of the isolated strains were of hospital origin. Comparative evaluation of antibiotic resistance has shown a wide spectrum of resistance of the isolated microorganisms to antimicrobial drugs, among those to the drugs used in the ENT departments.
