The central causative event in infectious, familial, and sporadic forms of prion disease is thought to be a conformational change that converts the cellular isoform of the prion protein (PrPC) into the scrapie isoform (PrPSc) that is the primary constituent of infectious prion particles. To provide a model system for analyzing the mechanistic details of this critical transformation, we have previously prepared cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells that stably express mouse PrP molecules carrying mutations homologous to those seen in familial prion diseases of humans. In the present work, we have analyzed the kinetics with which a PrP molecule containing an insertional mutation associated with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease acquires several biochemical properties characteristic of PrPSc. Within 10 min of pulse labeling, the mutant protein undergoes a molecular alteration that is detectable by a change in Triton X-114 phase partitioning and phenyl-Sepharose binding. After 30 min of labeling, a detergent-insoluble and protease-sensitive form of the protein appears. After a chase period of several hours, the protein becomes protease-resistant. Incubation of cells at 18 degrees C or treatment with brefeldin A inhibits acquisition of detergent insolubility and protease resistance but does not affect Triton X-114 partitioning and phenyl-Sepharose binding. Our results support a model in which conversion of mutant PrPs to a PrPSc-like state proceeds in a stepwise fashion via a series of identifiable biochemical intermediates, with the earliest step occurring during or very soon after synthesis of the polypeptide in the endoplasmic reticulum.
