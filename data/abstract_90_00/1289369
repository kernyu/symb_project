OBJECTIVE: The effect of selective decontamination of the digestive tract (SDD) on Intensive Therapy Unit (ITU)-acquired enterococcal infection and colonization was studied. Changes in the predominant species isolated and resistance patterns to antimicrobial agents were also studied. DESIGN: Three groups were investigated: historical control (HC), contemporaneous control (CC) and patients receiving SDD (topical polymyxin, amphotericin B and tobramycin throughout ITU stay with intravenous ceftazidime for the first 3 days only). SETTING: Adult general ITU with 7 beds. PATIENTS: Patients with a nasogastric tube in situ and who were likely to remain in ITU for 48 h or longer were recruited. RESULTS: Enterococcal infections occurred in 3 of 84 HC patients and 2 of 91 CC patients. There were no unit-acquired enterococcal infections in the SDD group. There were 140 episodes of enterococcal colonization occurring in 112 patients, with significantly more in the SDD and CC groups (p < 0.05. There were no significant differences in antibiotic sensitivities between the three groups. Enterococcus faecalis was the most frequently isolated species. CONCLUSION: SDD does not predispose to enterococcal infection but does encourage colonization in patients receiving the regimen and other patients in ITU at the same. There is a complex interaction of factors which influence faecal flora and the likelihood of patients becoming colonized or infected with enterococci.
