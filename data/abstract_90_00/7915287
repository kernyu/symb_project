Staphylococcus aureus strains resistant to mupirocin (MIC > 4000 mg l-1) were recovered from children and staff at a school for children with eczema and/or asthma or cystic fibrosis after mupirocin had been used to treat eczematous lesions. At least three distinct strains of S. aureus were involved and resistance was shown to be due in most isolates to a transmissible plasmid. The need for monitoring the extended use of this valuable antibiotic is emphasized.
