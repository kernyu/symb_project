Twelve clarithromycin-resistant Helicobacter pylori isolates (100% of resistant isolates examined) from seven different patients each contained an A-->G transition mutation within a conserved loop of 23S rRNA. A-->G transition mutations at positions cognate with Escherichia coli 23S rRNA positions 2058 and 2059 were identified. Clarithromycin-susceptible H. pylori isolates from 14 different patients displayed no polymorphisms in a conserved loop within domain V of 23S rRNA. The study is the first to report mutations in H. pylori associated with resistance to an antimicrobial agent used in established peptic ulcer treatment regimens.
