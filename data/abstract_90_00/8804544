We report a case of Fusarium solani infection in a 2 1/2-year-old girl with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and severe neutropenia. The infection, initially limited to her sinuses, became disseminated, as evidenced by the development of a characteristic cutaneous lesion on her left leg after a cumulative dose of amphotericin B of 18.3 mg/kg. Amphotericin B lipid complex (ABLC), 5 mg/kg/day, in conjunction with repeated surgical debridement of the sinuses and correction of neutropenia with granulocyte colony stimulating factor (GCSF), led to clinical and mycologic cure.
