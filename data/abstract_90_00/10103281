Forty-seven Enterococcus faecium strains from different sources were evaluated by restriction endonuclease analysis (REA) of total chromosomal DNA. Strains from chicken, pork, and humans were clearly divided into separate clusters, whereas strains from different countries, strains with different antibiotic resistance profiles, or clinical and healthy-subject strains were not.
