The beta-lactam susceptibilities of 65 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae for which penicillin MICs covered a broad range were assessed. The order of potency was amoxicillin (AMX) = amoxicillin-clavulanate (AMC) > penicillin G > cefpodoxime (CPO) > cefuroxime (CXM) > cefprozil > cefaclor > loracarbef > cefixime. No decrease in susceptibility was seen following repeated subculture of two penicillin-susceptible strains of S. pneumoniae in AMX, AMC, cefaclor, or loracarbef, whereas repeated exposure to CPO and CXM resulted in 4- to 32-fold decreases in susceptibility for both strains. When one of these strains was exposed to concentrations of CPO, CXM, AMX, and AMC achieved in the serum of humans following the administration of an oral dose, all agents were rapidly bactericidal, with no decrease in susceptibility up to 72 h. This was consistent with antibiotic concentrations exceeding the MICs for 100% of the dosing interval. For a penicillin-resistant strain, MICs were exceeded for 29% of the 12-h dosing interval for 500 mg of AMX, 42% of the interval for AMC with 875 mg of AMX and 125 mg of clavulanate (875/125 mg of AMC) 21% of the interval for 500 mg of CXM, and 0% of the interval for 200 mg of CPO. Consequently, only 875/125 mg of AMC produced a sustained bactericidal effect. A four- to eightfold reduction in susceptibility to CPO and CXM and cross-resistance with cefotaxime, but not penicillin or AMC, were selected following exposure to simulated serum CPO and CXM concentrations. In addition, AMX and AMC were the only agents which consistently produced a >99% reduction in bacterial numbers in time-kill studies using concentrations of antibiotic achieved in middle ear fluid for all three strains of penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae tested.
