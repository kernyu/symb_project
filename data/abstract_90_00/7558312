Acquired cellular resistance against Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) infections involves the induction of Th1 type gamma interferon (IFN-gamma)-producing T cells. Interleukin-12 (IL-12) is a cytokine involved in the control of IFN-gamma production by T cells and NK cells. The role of IL-12 in the response to MAC infection was investigated. Depletion of endogenous IL-12 by injection of monoclonal antibody prior to and during intranasal infection with MAC resulted in an 150- to 550-fold increase in bacterial load in lung, spleen, and liver homogenates by 10 weeks postinfection. Depletion of IL-12 abrogated the ability of spleen cell cultures to produce IFN-gamma in response to stimulus with live MAC. IL-12-depleted mice showed a 75% decrease in the number of inflammatory cells entering the lungs following intranasal infection with MAC, with significant reductions in cytotoxic activity and nitric oxide production by lung cells. This work suggests that IL-12 plays a major role in the activation of IFN-gamma-producing cells during MAC infection.
