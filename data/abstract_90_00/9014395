A study was undertaken to determine the level of chloroquine sensitivity in P. falciparum strains prevalent in a rural, tribal-belt of Bharuch district, Gujarat during 1992-93. Of the 32 cases for which the 7-day follow-up was completed, only in one RII level of resistance was noted, with the mean parasite clearance time in the remaining cases being 1.87 days. Thus, chloroquine continues to be effective in treatment on falciparum malaria in this area.
