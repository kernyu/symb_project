BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: High-dose chemotherapy and autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT) has become the standard approach for most patients with relapsed or refractory Hodgkin's disease. Disease status at transplant has been correlated with outcome following ABMT. In light of this, we employ mini-BEAM (BCNU, etoposide, cytarabine and melphalan) salvage therapy in order to achieve a state of minimal residual disease prior to transplantation. DESIGN AND METHODS: From February 1992 to June 1998 twenty-four patients receiving mini-BEAM therapy for resistance or relapse of their Hodgkin's disease were included. Four patients had obtained no response with initial chemotherapy (refractory), eight had obtained an incomplete response, seven were in first relapse and five in second or subsequent relapse. Fifteen patients received mini-BEAM as first salvage chemotherapy regimen. The remaining nine patients had previously been exposed to a median of one salvage regimen. Patients received a median of three cycles of mini-BEAM. RESULTS: Sixteen patients achieved complete remission and four partial remission, yielding an overall response rate of 83%. No significant differences in response were observed between patients who received mini-BEAM as initial salvage therapy and those who had received a prior salvage regimen. Eighteen out of the twenty responding patients went on to intensive therapy and peripheral blood stem cell transplantation. With a median follow-up of 52 months, the cumulative probability of 7-year overall survival is 71% for the responders and that of the 6-year disease-free survival is 42%. No treatment-related deaths were observed. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Mini-BEAM is an effective salvage regimen with moderate toxicity that may be useful for cytoreduction prior to stem cell procedures.
