The results of the long-term follow up of the sensitivity of S. aureus in our catchment area to nine commonly used antibiotics indicate that unaltered state of sensitivity to OXA, SPI, GEN, CFT, LIN (97.2%-99.5%). In coagulase negative staphylococci tested with 11 antibacterial substances the authors recorded a decline of sensitivity KAN, LIN, SPI, ERY by 15.7% to 24.8% From five tested antibiotic combinations to a group of strains of S. aureus (n = 87-117) the combination CFT + GEN was most effective having a synergic action on 64.3% strains. No antagonistic effect was recorded.
