Thirty-six of 36 strains of Enterobacter cloacae and E. aerogenes with inducible beta-lactamase developed resistance when cefoxitin (inducer) was added to cefuroxime disks. Constitutive beta-lactamase producers (n = 23) were all resistant to cefuroxime. Cefuroxime resistance correlated with the amount of induced or constitutive beta-lactamase. Cefuroxime was a better indicator of induced resistance than cefamandole, cefazolin, cephalothin, ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, ticarcillin with or without clavulanic acid, or cefotetan. Induction by addition of cefoxitin to disks occasionally reduced zone sizes but not enough to change interpretations for ceftazidime, ceftizoxime, aztreonam, cefoperazone with or without sulbactam, and piperacillin with or without tazobactam. Most enterobacters were resistant to cefmetazole. The cefoxitin inducer-cefuroxime indicator method can be used in routine clinical laboratories to detect latent resistance due to chromosomally mediated inducible beta-lactamase in enterobacters.
