The carbapenemase gene (cfiA) was detected in 12 (6.9%) out of 175 clinical isolates of Bacteroides fragilis from Nottingham, three times the frequency reported from France. Only one gene copy was present in all cases. Eleven (6.3%) of the cfiA-positive isolates were susceptible to imipenem or meropenem (MIC < 8 mg/L); strains of this type have the potential to convert to high-level resistance. One isolate (0.6%) displayed resistance to both carbapenem antibiotics and was associated with specific carbapenemase activity six times that of the sensitive isolates.
