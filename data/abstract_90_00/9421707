Drug-resistant tuberculosis remains a worldwide problem. New laboratory methods have improved our ability to more rapidly identify resistant strains, but the most effective approach is to prevent the appearance of resistance by appropriate choice of antibiotics and directly-observed therapy. Mycobacterium tuberculosis is treated with familiar and unique drugs; consequently, mechanisms of resistance have some unique features. All drug resistance thus far identified develops by mutational events rather than acquisition of resistance genes from other bacteria. An agenda is presented for countering the appearance of further drug resistance in mycobacteria.
