A retrospective study of the characteristics of MRSA (methicillin resistant S. aureus) in Kagoshima University Hospital and its ENT department was reported. There were 231 samples (104 strains) MRSA in all S. aureus 448 samples from Jan. to Sep. 1989 in Kagoshima University Hospital, in which 58 strains (55.8%) were coagulase type II and 35 strains (33.7%) were type VII. The much more predominant numbers of MRSA were observed in all the cases inpatients clinics in surgery, pediatrics, urology, gynecology and dermatology than internal medicine as well as outpatients clinics. In ENT department of this hospital, only 15.4% of all S. aureus were MRSA. On the other hand, bacteriological survey showed 26% of MRSA out of all S. aureus which were detected at Tokyo clinical research center on otorrhea in the patients with chronic otitis media as multicenter clinical trial of Japan. Two cases involved by MRSA after postoperative administration of many types of antibiotics were also demonstrated. These MRSAs were producing type II coagulase and very high concentrations of MICs to many antibiotics were observed. But these cases were not severe and MINO (minocyclin) or GM (gentamicin) were so effective. The effect of combined therapy of some antibiotics or antimicrobial agents was discussed briefly.
