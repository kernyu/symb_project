The activity of chloroquine and quinine, alone and in combination with desferrioxamine (7 mumol/liter), was evaluated in vitro against susceptible and resistant clones of Plasmodium falciparum by a semimicroassay system. The addition of desferrioxamine had no effect on the activity of chloroquine against both clones. Desferrioxamine had no effect on the activity of quinine against the susceptible clone but had slightly enhanced quinine action against the resistant clone. Further development of desferrioxamine as an antimalarial drug may be of limited interest.
