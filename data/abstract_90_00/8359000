From June to August 1991, there was an outbreak of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections in an intensive care unit in a general hospital in Sao Paulo, Brazil. We obtained 14 isolates from 14 patients, 11 from tracheal aspirate, and 3 from surgical wound exudates. These strains were typed by serotyping, pyocin typing, and pulsed-field electrophoresis (CHEF) of chromosomal DNA (chrDNA), and the different typing methods were analyzed. These three methods demonstrated seven identical strains. We also performed an extensive antibiogram (33 drugs) in all 14 isolates. The incidence of resistance to aminoglycosides, extended-spectrum beta-lactams, and quinolones was very high among the seven identical isolates; however, the antibiogram profile differed significantly among the isolates. Our results suggest that a unique strain caused several cross-transmitted infections during this period of time, and the emergence of antimicrobial resistance has been occurring before and after the establishment of the epidemic strain by selective drug use. The chrDNA fingerprinting proved to be versatile and precise for epidemiologic investigations of P. aeruginosa infections.
