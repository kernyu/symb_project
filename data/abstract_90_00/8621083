A Bacillus Calmette Guerlin (BCG) DNA fragment was identified which conferred hypersensitivity to isoniazid (INH) upon Mycobacterium smegmatis (Ms) when present on a multicopy plasmid. The gene cluster present on this fragment contains the genes encoding ribosomal proteins L36 (rpmJ), S13 (rpsM), S11 (rpsK) and S4 (rpsD), as well as the gene encoding initiation factor-1 (infA), an open reading frame of unknown function (ORFX) and a putative promoter region. The rpsM gene, from either BCG or Ms is necessary and sufficient to produce the INH-hypersensitive phenotype in Ms, but the gene cluster has no effect on INH sensitivity when introduced into BCG on a multicopy plasmid. The presence of rpsM on a multicopy plasmid also causes an increase in catalase/peroxidase (Kat/Prx) activity in Ms. The overproduction of S13 may induce a stress response, resulting in increased expression of katG (encoding Kat/Prx) in Ms, thereby causing hypersensitivity to INH.
