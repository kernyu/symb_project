1 New thiazolidinediones BM13.1258 and BM15.2054 were studied with regard to their PPARgamma-agonistic activities and to their acute and chronic effects on glucose metabolism in soleus muscle strips from lean and genetically obese rats. 2 Both BM13.1258 and BM15.2054 revealed to be potent PPARgamma-activators in transient transfection assays in vitro. 3 In insulin-resistant obese rats, but not in lean rats, 10 days of oral treatment with either compound increased the stimulatory effect of insulin on muscle glycogen synthesis to a similar extent (insulin-induced increment in micromol glucose incorporated into glycogen g-1 h-1: control, +1.19+/-0.28; BM13.1258, +2.50+/-0.20; BM15.2054, +2.55+/-0.46; P<0.05 vs control each). 4 In parallel to insulin sensitization, mean glucose oxidation increased insulin-independently in response to BM13.1258 (to 191 and 183% of control in the absence and presence of insulin, respectively; P<0.01 each), which was hardly seen in response to BM15.2054 (to 137 and 124% of control, respectively; ns). 5 Comparable effects on PPARgamma activation and on amelioration of insulin resistance by BM13.1258 and BM15.2054 were therefore opposed by different effects on glucose oxidation. 6 In contrast to chronic oral treatment, acute exposure of muscles to BM13.1258 or BM15.2054 in vitro elicited a distinct catabolic response of glucose metabolism in specimens from both lean and obese rats. 7 The results provide evidence that BM13.1258 and BM15.2054 can affect muscle glucose metabolism via more than one mechanism of action. 8 Further efforts are required to clarify, to what extent other mechanisms besides insulin sensitization via the activation of PPARgamma are involved in the antidiabetic actions of thiazolidinediones.
