It was established in experiments on CBA mice and outbred rats that acute dichloroethane (0.75 LD50) intoxication leads to decrease of antiinfectious immunological and nonspecific resistance of the organism, antibody production, and cell immune response evaluated according to the delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) reaction. Administration of the antidote acetyl-cysteine increased suppression of the reactions under study (with the exception of DTH), while dipiroxim weakened it. The dipiroxim effects are associated with reactivation of immunocyte alpha-naphthyl-AS-acetatesterase by this compound (and possibly also of other types of esterases of immunocompetent cells).
