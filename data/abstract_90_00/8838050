The antimicrobial susceptibility of 775 isolates of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, recovered in Barbados over a five-year period, was studied by disc diffusion. Sensitivity to penicillin declined from 56% in 1990 to 38% in 1994. The prevalence of beta-lactamase production rose from 30% to 50% during this period and sensitivity to tetracycline declined from 96% to 46%, while co-trimoxazole and spectinomycin sensitivities varied. Ceftriaxone, norfloxacin and erythromycin were the only compounds tested to which sensitivity remained uniform. The results confirm the current recommendations by several agencies that ceftriaxone or an oral fluoroquinolone should be considered the drug of choice for the empirical treatment of gonorrhoea.
