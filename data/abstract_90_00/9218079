AIM: To evaluate the efficacy of a 7-day regimen of clarithromycin 250 mg b.d., amoxycillin 1 g b.d., and lansoprazole 30 mg b.d. as a treatment for Helicobacter pylori infection. METHODS: H. pylori status of dyspeptic patients was assessed by 13C-urea breath test and at endoscopy by histology, culture and rapid urease testing of gastric biopsies. Fifty-one H. pylori-positive patients were treated with the above regimen. H. pylori status was reassessed by 13C-urea breath test not less than 28 days after completing treatment. Adverse events and compliance were evaluated. RESULTS: On an intention-to-treat basis. H. pylori infection was cured in 77% (95% CI: 65-88%) of patients. Minor side-effects including diarrhoea, nausea and taste disturbance were reported by 64% of patients. Ninety-five per cent of patients consumed > 95% of tablets. Metronidazole resistance was 29% but all cultures were sensitive to amoxycillin and clarithromycin. CONCLUSION: This 7-day treatment with low-dose clarithromycin was moderately effective in curing H. pylori infection. Although compliance was excellent, there was a high frequency of minor adverse events.
