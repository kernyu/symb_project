In order to assess the sporocidal activity of chlorine and peracetic acid (PAA), alone and in combination, against a spored biofilm, the biofilms of two species (Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633 and Bacillus megaterium ATCC 8245) were formed on inert support (tygon). A sporulation kinetic of these bacteria in biofilm was established. Sporocidal properties of chlorine and PAA were compared against free spores, spores fixed by drying and spores in biofilm. The combination of these two products was also tested. Minimal sporocidal concentrations (MSC) of the two products towards free spores were determined (contact time 5 mn). The efficacy of these MSC were evaluated in terms of contact time on adhered spores and on spores in biofilm. Chlorine and PAA exhibited an excellent sporocidal activity. The combination of PAA and chlorine, tested by checkerboard micromethod, was found to be synergistic in case of free or adhered spores. The spored biofilm showed a high resistance. The combination of these two products revealed then only an additive effect.
