Cyclosporine (CSA) causes an acute vasoconstriction of renal artery and a significant increase in renal endothelin release. Pentoxifylline, a vasodilator, has been suggested to prevent CSA toxicity. To study the effect of pentoxifylline treatment on CSA-related vasoconstriction and endothelin release, a model of renal autoperfusion in the dog was used. Oral pentoxifylline at the dose of 400 mg three times daily for 3 days was given to 15 dogs. Pure powder CSA (10 mg) was injected into the isolated renal artery perfused at constant flow; changes in perfusion pressure reflected variations in vascular resistance. In the pentoxifylline-treated group (15 dogs), the infusion of CSA caused an average increase of 27 +/- 8 mm Hg in renal perfusion pressure, compared with 60 +/- 10 mm Hg in a control group of 8 untreated animals (p < or = 0.05). Plasma concentration of endothelin in the renal vein increased from an average of 1.2 +/- 0.2 pg/mL before to 2.4 +/- 0.5 pg/mL after CSA administration (p < or = 0.05) in the control group, whereas it did not change significantly in the pentoxifylline-treated group. Thus, oral pretreatment with pentoxifylline significantly decreased the renal vasoconstriction and endothelin release due to CSA administration.
