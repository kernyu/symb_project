Assessing the surgically treated progressive abscesses of the head and neck from 1991 to 1993 at our clinic of maxillofacial surgery, a surprising percentage of the microbiologically isolated germs showed resistance against the recommended antibiotics of first choice. The location of the abscesses, the microbiological spectrum and the clinical course are analysed and compared with the literature. Preventing possible severe complication of progressive abscesses of the head and the neck an additional parenteral antibiotic therapy in high doses combined with the surgical treatment is recommended. Common dentoalveolar infections without progressive tendency are sufficiently treated surgically without administration of antibiotics.
