Vibrio cholerae causes epidemic diarrhea throughout the world. Fluid replacement is the primary therapy for cholera; however, high mortality rates often necessitate the use of antibiotics. V. cholerae, like most bacteria, has developed resistance to some antibiotics. In the early 1990s a new serotype strain, Bengal 0139, began a new wave of cholera epidemics. Bengal isolates showed unique trends in antimicrobial resistance. Many clinical laboratories use automated antibiotic susceptibility testing for V. cholerae. It is important to know if automated susceptibility test results for V. cholerae coincide with reported trends in antibiotic susceptibility. In the present study, we used the Vitek automated susceptibility system to determine the susceptibilities of 79 V. cholerae O1 isolates, 100 O139 isolates, and 112 non-O1 isolates. Vitek susceptibilities for V. cholerae showed a good correlation with preestablished epidemiological data. Although the new O139 serogroup showed a trend of increased resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and nitrofurantoin, it was more susceptible to ampicillin than previous serogroup O1 and non-O1 strains. Regardless of serogroup, > or = 98% of the V. cholerae isolates tested were susceptible to most antibiotics tested by us. It is important to continue susceptibility testing of all new isolates of V. cholerae because of emerging resistant strains. However, V. cholerae remains susceptible to most of the available antibiotics.
