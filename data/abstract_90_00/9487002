Scientific knowledge and technology will continue to rapidly expand, having a profound effect upon patient care and research. As economic resources become more limited, new strategies will be formulated leading to innovative management approaches based upon a clearer understanding of host-pathogen interactions. Information management and a strong scientific research infrastructure will provide the necessary foundation for new discoveries. Funding for applied and basic research will flow from academic-industry-government partnerships in various combinations.
