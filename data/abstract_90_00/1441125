Six cashmere goat herds in Scotland were surveyed to assess the prevalence of anthelmintic resistance and the species of nematode involved. Resistance was determined in vivo by a faecal egg count reduction test and in vitro using an egg hatch assay and specific faecal egg identification techniques. Benzimidazole resistance was present in five of the herds, insufficient eggs were obtained from the other herd to draw firm conclusions. Teladorsagia (Ostertagia) species predominated in four of the five herds in which resistance was detected and Haemonchus contorus was the dominant species in the other.
