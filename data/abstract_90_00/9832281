We evaluated a strategy designed to improve useful activity of ciprofloxacin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Following changes in antimicrobial agent use made by the institutional Pharmacy and Therapeutic Drug Committee, monthly drug usage and microbial susceptibility records from June 1992 through October 1995 were reviewed. From July 1992 through October 1992 (Period 1), ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin usage represented 95 and 5% of total quinolone doses; from December 1992 to March 1993 (Period 2), ciprofloxacin represented 19%; from July 1993 to October 1993 (Period 3), ciprofloxacin usage represented 85%; from July 1994 to October 1994 (Period 4), ciprofloxacin represented 95%; and from July 1995 to October 1995 (Period 5), ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin respectively represented 98 and 2% of total quinolone doses. Comparison of the anti-pseudomonal activity of the two fluoroquinolones to ofloxacin use, ciprofloxacin use and total quinolone use during the entire observational period showed the highest (negative) correlation with ofloxacin use versus ofloxacin activity (y = -15.04x + 1367.99, r2 = 0.06, w = 0.126). Increased use of quinolones plus a change to primarily ofloxacin usage appeared to adversely affect the activity of both ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin against P. aeruginosa.
