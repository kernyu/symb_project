In conclusion, diarrheal illnesses remain a major clinical problem for patients infected with HIV-1, particularly those with AIDS. Opportunistic enteric pathogens for which there is no effective treatment, the emergence of new opportunistic agents, and the enlarging patterns of drug resistance continue to challenge us. However, better understanding of HIV-1-induced mucosal immunosuppression, sound clinical judgement, careful diagnostic evaluation, development of newer antimicrobial agents, and judicious patient management should help us meet this challenge.
