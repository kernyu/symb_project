A certain number of HIV-infected patients (about 17% in our series) manifest symptoms of cortisol resistance--weakness, weight loss, hypertension, chronic fatigue and intense mucocutaneous melanosis--symptoms which are also typical of Addison's disease. The diagnosis of cortisol resistance is determined through the increased plasma and urinary cortisol values and limited increases in ACTH values. Compared with patients with primary glucocorticoid resistance, AIDS patients have no symptoms of mineral-corticoid or androgen excess, only of glucocorticoid deficiency at target tissues. Mononuclear leukocytes from these patients show receptor changes which consist of an increased receptor number and decreased receptor affinity for glucocorticoids. They also show defective glucocorticoid-induced inhibition of [3H]thymidine incorporation. Glucocorticoid-resistant AIDS patients have a characteristic persistent increase in interferon-alpha production. The inverse correlation between plasma values of interferon-alpha and the receptor affinity for glucocorticoids clearly suggests that interferon production is regulated by the glucocorticoid receptor: the smaller the glucocorticoid effect on lymphocyte cells is, the greater interferon production is. Owing to the antiviral effect of interferon-alpha, it is possible that glucocorticoid-resistant AIDS patients have greater defences against viral infection than other AIDS patients. As interferon-alpha is melanogenetic, its increased production may also explain the intense skin pigmentation found in patients with the glucocorticoid-resistance syndrome.
