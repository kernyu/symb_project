This study investigates the chromosomal alterations involved in the acquisition of PALA resistance of LoVo colorectal cancer cells homozygous for wild-type TP53 before and after transfection with a 143Ala-mutated TP53 gene. PALA resistance was always associated with an increased number of CAD gene copies, but gene amplification sensu stricto was rarely observed. Interestingly, distinct chromosome patterns were found in relation to the TP53 status of the cells. In parental LoVo cells, the CAD copy number was increased through gains of normal chromosome 2 whereas in transfectant clones, resistance mostly occurred through chromosome rearrangements. The relationship with the two different cytogenetic patterns described in colorectal tumors is discussed.
