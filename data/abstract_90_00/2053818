The use of ampicillin, benzylpenicillin, gentamicin, erythromycin, cefamezine or cephaloridine in combination with levamisole aimed at increasing their efficacy and correcting the adverse reactions was studied. Immunological activity of the antibiotics was comparatively characterized by using standard methods. It was shown that the character of the antibiotic effect on the basic factors of nonspecific resistance and immunity was heterogeneous. Schemes for using the antibiotics in combination with levamisole for correcting the detected disorders in the immunity status of the experimental animals were developed.
