The current standard of Helicobacter pylori treatment has been confirmed by the studies presented at the Lisbon workshop--that is, one of three one week proton pump inhibitor (PPI) based triple therapies comprising a twice daily standard dose of a PPI in combination with two of the following antimicrobial agents: clarithromycin, amoxycillin, or a nitromidazole. This standard of treatment is also highly efficacious and cost-effective in routine community practice. The current data confirm the equivalence of ranitidine bismuth citrate to PPI, and of azithromycin to clarithromycin. The optimum dose for azithromycin has not yet been defined. There is some evidence that in certain regions treatment for more than one week may be advantageous. The reasons are still not clear. However, microbial resistance may be one important factor, as it has a substantial effect on treatment outcome and the prevalence of resistance varies considerably in different areas. The negative impact of resistance is increased by shortening the treatment time. At present, there is no general necessity to test for resistance before treatment. However, before selection of a second line treatment, testing for resistance is recommended.
