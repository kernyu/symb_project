In this study, the expression of polymorphic and non-polymorphic MHC antigens in Ewing's tumor (ET) cells was examined by surface staining, Western blots and transcriptional analysis. Cell lines derived from Ewing's tumors largely lack polymorphic HLA class Ia antigens of both the HLA-A and the HLA-B loci but binding of monomorphic HLA antibodies indicates significant expression of HLA-C locus antigens and/or HLA class Ib molecules. HLA Ib molecules encoded by the HLA-E, -F or -G loci with a molecular mass of less than 44 kDa were not detected in lysates of either constitutive or TNF-alpha plus IFN-gamma treated ET cells. Two representative ET cell lines with either detectable HLA-A, -B antigens (A673) or absolutely non-detectable HLA-A, -B antigens (SK-ES-1) were further subjected to transcriptional analysis. A673 mRNA hybridized with HLA-A, -B, -C and HLA-E-specific probes in Northern blots. By contrast, mRNA specific for HLA-A, -B, -C was negative in SK-ES-1 but TNF-alpha plus IFN-gamma reconstituted HLA-A, -B, -C transcription in this cell line. HLA-E was transcribed in A673 but not in SK-ES-1. Combining mRNA and surface expression of HLA class Ia molecules results in a highly variable pattern of defective HLA class I expression in this type of neuroectodermal tumor. The involvement of the ET-specific fusion transcript EWS/Fli-1 in modulating the HLA-A and -B locus antigens is likely to occur by the upregulation of c-myc in these tumors. The exceptionally constant expression of HLA-C or some other non-A, non-B antigens (reactive with defined monoclonal antibodies) implies important consequences on tumor-cell resistance against specific CTL and NK activity in vivo.
