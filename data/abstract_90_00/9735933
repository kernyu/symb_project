Five cases of blackwater fever (BWF) are described, all of whom had a history of recent quinine therapy. In two cases a second haemolytic crisis was induced by halofantrine, in one case also a third. Increasing frequency of this syndrome with its dramatic clinical presentation is to be expected as imported P. falciparum infection, parasite resistance to chloroquine and the use of quinine and other related antimalarials become more frequent.
