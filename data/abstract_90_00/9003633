Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) pol mutations are responsible for HIV-1 resistance to current antiretroviral drugs. HIV-1 RNA extraction with QIAamp HCV kit spin columns (Qiagen, Chatsworth, Calif.) followed by reverse transcription-PCR successfully recovered a 1,008-bp pol fragment from the plasma of 31 of 34 HIV-1-infected patients that was suitable for sequencing and recombinant-virus studies. The minimum HIV-1 RNA concentration required for gene recovery was 30 to 40 copies/ml, which was similar to the minimal HIV-1 RNA concentration required when phenol-chloroform or silica beads are used for RNA extraction.
