Bacterial resistance to antimicrobial agents is a common problem observed in hospitals. We characterized a clinical isolate of Klebsiella pneumoniae (R-3455) which was resistant to high concentrations of broad spectrum beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones, chloramphenicol and tetracycline. Conjugation experiments showed that the multiresistance could be transferred to Escherichia coli J53-2 receptor strain. The transconjugant X-3455 was resistant to all antibacterials assayed in R-3455, except to fluoroquinolones. We found that both strains R-3455 and X-3455 produced a beta-lactamase which was sensitive to clavulanic acid. Southern hybridization and PCR analysis showed the presence of at least, a TEM type beta-lactamase gene in both strains.
