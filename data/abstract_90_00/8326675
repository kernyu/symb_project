In order to study antibacterial activities of ofloxacin (OFLX), minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of OFLX were determined against clinical isolates obtained from ophthalmic institutes all over the country and those isolated and identified from patients with various ocular infections during three years from September 1989 until August 1992, and the results were compared with those of the control drugs. The following results were obtained. 1. Compared with the reports by others presented from 1984 through 1986, increases were observed for strains with moderate or low susceptibilities to OFLX such as Staphylococcus spp., Corynebacterium spp., Serratia spp., and glucose-nonfermentative Gram-negative rods ((G) NF-GNR). 2. Although incidence of resistance to OFLX increased among the above strains, remarkably low frequencies was observed for the occurrence of highly resistant strains to OFLX with MIC value > 100 micrograms/ml. 3. The antibacterial spectrum of OFLX covered (G)NF-GNR, and the activity of OFLX was superior to those of aminoglycosides, penicillins and cephems used as the control drugs. 4. Low incidence of highly resistant strains to OFLX and its broad antibacterial spectrum suggested the usefulness of a 0.3% OFLX ophthalmic solution in achieving concentrations exceeding MIC for a prolonged period of time.
