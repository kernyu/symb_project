Retrospective examination of case records and laboratory findings related to 155 patients discharged from the Urological Department of the All-Union Oncology Research Centre, Academy of Medical Sciences of the USSR within a period of 3 months showed that 41.9 per cent of the oncourological patients had infectious processes requiring antibacterial therapy. Among 80 infectious episodes 62 or 77.5 per cent were of intrahospital origin. There was a relationship of the frequency of the infections to localization of the tumor process, a patient's age, the treatment character and some diagnostic and treatment procedures. 70 per cent of the hospital infections were urinary and 15 per cent referred to suppuration of the operative wounds. The predominant causative agents of the complications were Pseudomonas spp., Klebsiella tribe, Proteus spp. and Enterococci with the highest levels of resistance to antibacterial drugs. The drugs of choice for treating the infections in that group of the patients were ofloxacin and cefotaxime. Aminoglycosides, semisynthetic penicillins, cephalosporins and urological antiseptics were used in accordance with antibioticograms. In the treatment of severe gram-negative infections dioxydin was used. Since hospital infections in oncourological patients are usually caused by hospital multiple resistant strains of microorganisms, often present in associations, the adequate antibacterial therapy requires constant bacteriological surveillance providing not only the choice of the most efficient drug but also early correction of the therapy after the pathogen change.
