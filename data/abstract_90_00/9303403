MexA-MexB-OprM is an efflux system in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. OprM overproduced from the cloned gene was able to complement OprM-deficient mutants but did not alter the resistance of a wild-type P. aeruginosa strain to the different antimicrobial agents tested. This suggests that OprM cannot function by itself to efflux antibiotics, including beta-lactams targeted to the periplasm.
