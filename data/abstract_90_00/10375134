Lactobacillus casei strain Shirota (LCS) is a probiotic bacterium used in the production of fermented milk products and lactic acid bacteria preparations. To investigate the survival of LCS in the gastrointestinal tract, we have developed a selective medium and specific monoclonal antibodies to isolate and identify this strain. Selective LLV agar medium was prepared by modifying LBS medium, a selective medium for lactobacilli, through the replacement of glucose with lactitol as a carbon source and vancomycin as a selective antibiotic. Culture in LLV agar medium followed by ELISA using monoclonal antibodies specific for LCS was able to detect the organism in faeces. Using this method, we studied the faecal recovery of LCS in individuals who drank 125 ml of fermented milk which contained 10(10) live LCS for 3 days. The mean recovery was about 10(7) live bacteria per gram of faeces, indicating that LCS survived transit through the gastrointestinal tract after ingestion of the fermented milk.
