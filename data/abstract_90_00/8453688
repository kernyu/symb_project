Eight patients, of whom four had acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and four had chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) blast crisis, were treated with a combination of cytosine arabinoside (ARA-C: 1,600 mg/m2 in three patients, 1,200 mg/m2 in five patients), tetrahydrouridine (THU: 2,800 mg/m2 in two patients, 2,646 mg/m2 in one patient, 2,100 mg/m2 in five patients), and carboplatin (900 mg/m2 in four patients, 720 mg/m2 in one patient, 450 mg/m2 in three patients). As a result of this treatment, five of the eight patients became aplastic. Two of the four patients with CML blast crisis reverted to the chronic phase and two of the four patients with acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL) attained a remission (one partial remission and one complete remission). The major toxicities included myelosuppression, unacceptable hepatotoxicity, and diarrhea. Pharmacokinetics studies revealed that the addition of carboplatin did not significantly change the disposition of ARA-C. ARA-C levels were not significantly changed in comparison with those obtained in a prior study of ARA-C with THU (ARA-C plasma levels at 3 h, 2630 +/- 1170 ng/ml).
