G3361/CP cells, a cisplatin (CDDP)-resistant subclone of the human melanoma cell line G3361, overexpress wild-type p53 protein and demonstrate an increase in the percentage of cells in G0--G1 arrest compared to parental cells. Exposing G3361/CP cells to human recombinant IFN-alpha2a reduces the high basal levels of p53, releases G3361/CP cells from G0-G1 into S phase, and abrogates CDDP resistance. These findings suggest that recombinant IFN-alpha2a disrupts p53-mediated cell cycle regulation to restore CDDP sensitivity in G3361/CP cells.
