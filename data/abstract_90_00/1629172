The Streptomyces mycarofaciens mdmB gene encodes a 3-O-acyltransferase that catalyzes the addition of acetyl and propionyl groups to position 3 of the lactone ring in 16-member macrolide antibiotics like midecamycin and spiramycin. A putative O-methyltransferase gene (mdmC) is immediately downstream of mdmB, and both of these genes are closely linked to the mdmA midecamycin resistance gene.
