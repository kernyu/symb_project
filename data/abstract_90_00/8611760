Arabidopsis thaliana and Nicotiana tabacum were transformed to blasticidin S (BS) resistance with BSD (the BS deaminase gene from Aspergillus terreus) using the Agrobacterium-mediated transformation method. Expression of BSD allowed direct selection of transformants by the fungicide, and both kinds of transgenic plants showed high level of resistance phenotype at 100 ppm of BS sprayed on the leaves. Using Botrytis cinerea, the causal fungus of gray mold disease, it was exemplified that application of BS could control the disease in transgenic tobacco with negligible phytotoxicity.
