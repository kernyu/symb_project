74 episodes of bacterial sepsis in 70 patients were analysed from July 1988 to June 1989. The incidence of sepsis is 0.7% of the whole admitted patients. Compared to a similar previous study from April 1982 to March 1983, the incidence of sepsis decreased (P less than 0.01), and the incidence of nosocomial sepsis remained unchanged, whereas its mortality decreased (P less than 0.05). The host defenses are important in predisposing to sepsis and determining prognosis. Antibiotic sensitivity test revealed that some bacterial strains were resistant to new beta-lactam antibiotics.
