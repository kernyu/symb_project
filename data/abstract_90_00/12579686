PURPOSE: To investigate the changes of bacterial strains in the conjunctival sac before and after intraocular surgery, as well as clinical effects of preoperative antibiotic agents. METHODS: One hundred and thirty-three eyes with intraocular surgery included 68 eyes with cataract surgery, 39 eyes with glaucoma surgery, 20 eyes with retinal detachment surgery and 6 eyes with vitretomy. Bacterial culture and pharmacologic sensitivity test were performed on the conjunctival smear from the 133 eyes with intraocular surgery before and after the operation and the anterior chamber aspirate from the 68 eyes with cataract surgery after the operation. RESULTS: At the time of admission, 61 eyes(45.8%) of 133 eyes with intraocular surgery were culture-positive conjunctival smears with the following identified: Staphlococcus aureus: 23 eyes; Staphlococcus epidermidis: 25 eyes; Gram-positive rods: 13 eyes. 8 eyes(6%) had culture-positive conjunctival smears before disinfection, (Staphlococcus aureus: 3 eyes; Staphlococcus epidermidis: 5 eyes). One eye(1.5%) had culture-positive Staphylococcus epidermidis in anterior chamber aspirate of 68 eyes with cataract surgery at conclusion of surgery. Also, 4 eyes(3%) were culture-positive conjunctival smears after surgery. All the bacterial strains of the group were sensitive to Tobramycin, Gentamycin, Cephradinum(Velosel), Vancomycinum and Rifampin, but they were resistance to Tetracyclinum, Chloromycetin, Erythromycin and Ofloxacin. Eye Science 1999; 15: 267-269. CONCLUSION: In order to prevent bacterial endophthalmitis after intraocular surgery, installation of an useful antibiotic eye drop before the surgery is important.
