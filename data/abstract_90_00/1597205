The influence of pefloxacin, 400 mg twice daily for ten days, on microbial colonization resistance was investigated in six healthy volunteers. In three volunteers impairment of colonization resistance was indicated by a significant increase in the faecal concentration of yeasts. In two of them, impairment of colonization resistance was confirmed by facilitation of colonization by a challenge strain of Klebsiella pneumoniae in the early post-treatment period. It is concluded that pefloxacin impairs colonization resistance in some volunteers. However, during pefloxacin therapy, overgrowth by aerobic bacteria is prevented by the very high antimicrobial concentration in faeces, and after therapy it is prevented by rapid restoration of colonization resistance.
