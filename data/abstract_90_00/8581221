As previously reported, we found that the fixation rate and thermal denaturation (shrink) temperature of the diepoxide-fixed tissue could be controlled by varying the concentration of the fixative as well as by adding alcohol and/or sodium chloride to the solution. In contrast to prior experience, however, we now found that the epoxide-fixed leaflets exhibited significantly higher resistance to mineralization compared to controls, but only when the tissue had not been exposed to phosphate ion.
