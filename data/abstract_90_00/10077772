Two hundred and thirteen clinical strains of coagulase-negative staphylococci isolated in Japan between 1980 and 1997 were analyzed for glycopeptide susceptibility by determining MIC using both Mueller-Hinton agar (MHA) and Brain Heart Infusion agar (BHIA) plates. Of 37 Staphylococcus epidermidis strains isolated between 1980 and 1981, all were susceptible to vancomycin and teicoplanin on both MHA and BHIA. However, of 122 isolates of Staphylococcus epidermidis isolated between 1994 and 1997, 1 (0.8%) was intermediate to vancomycin on MHA and 39 (32%) were intermediate on BHIA, while 3 (2.5%) and 27 (22.1%) were intermediate or resistant to teicoplanin on MHA and BHIA, respectively. It was demonstrated that the susceptibilities of the strains in 1990s to vancomycin and teicoplanin were significantly decreased compared with those in 1980s. Population analysis was performed with six strains each of Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus haemolyticus (three with vancomycin MIC > or = 8 micrograms/ml and three with vancomycin MIC < or = 4 micrograms/ml using BHIA). The population curves of the Staphylococcus epidermidis strains showed a homogeneous pattern of susceptibility. Whereas, those for two Staphylococcus haemolyticus strains (vancomycin MIC = 8 micrograms/ml using BHIA) showed a typical heterogeneous pattern. Vancomycin-resistant mutants (MIC > or = 32 micrograms/ml) were obtained with a high frequency of 10(-4)-(-5) from the strains by one-step selection with 16 micrograms/ml of vancomycin.
