The clinical microbiology laboratory is strategically positioned to recognize changing patterns in bacterial resistance to antimicrobials. This requires the application of accurate testing methods and a methodological survey of drug-resistance patterns among clinically important bacteria. This information can be assembled into comprehensive international databases, using a common format to facilitate monitoring.
