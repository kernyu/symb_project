If variation in azole resistance is due to inherent differences in strains of Candida albicans, as a predominantly clonal organism, then correlation between multilocus genotypes and drug resistance would be expected. A sample of 81 clinical isolates from patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus in Toronto, Canada, plus 3 reference isolates were genotyped at 16 loci, distributed on all linkage groups, by means of oligonucleotide hybridizations specific for each of the alleles at each locus. These multilocus genotypes were significantly correlated with DNA fingerprints obtained with the species-specific probe 27A, indicating widespread linkage disequilibrium in the genome. There were 64 multilocus diploid genotypes and 77 DNA fingerprint types delineated in this sample. Neither the multilocus genotyping nor DNA fingerprinting alone identified all of the 81 types identified by the combination of these two methods. Multilocus genotypes were not predictive of fluconazole resistance, suggesting that resistance is gained or lost too quickly to be predicted by linkage with neutral markers.
