The members of the Interplanetary Society (Pus Club) have made significant contributions to the understanding of the pathogenesis of infective endocarditis (IE). Although the incidence of IE has essentially remained unchanged, the spectrum and characteristics of patients potentially affected by this disorder are expanding. Moreover, in addition to the typical microorganisms implicated in IE, there are increasing reports of new or atypical pathogens causing IE, including those that are resistant to standard antibiotic therapy. The infectious diseases community is challenged to continue to provide effective antimicrobial regimens for IE and to further develop diagnostic and surgical strategies to identify and treat patients with this disorder. New information is available regarding the demographics, diagnostic methods, and therapeutic options for the management of IE.
