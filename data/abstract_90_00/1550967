In a double-blind randomized comparative study, 75 patients were treated with amorolfine cream 0.125, 0.25 or 0.5%. At the end of treatment clinical cure rates of 80, 76 and 84%, respectively, and mycological cures of 72, 64 and 76% were obtained. At 2 months posttherapy follow-up relapse rates were 0, 12 and 12%, respectively. There was no significant difference between the three groups in terms of clinical and mycological response, duration of treatment or tolerance. In a double-blind parallel study, 40 patients were treated topically with either 0.5% amorolfine cream or 1% bifonazole cream. The percentages of combined clinical and mycological cures were 83.3 and 78.95%, respectively. There was no significant difference in terms of tolerance and clinical and mycological cure rates. All treatments were applied once daily. Posttreatment MIC values did not indicate development of resistance to either amorolfine or bifonazole.
