The beta-lactamase gene from a periodontal strain of Eikenella corrodens, resistant to penicillins and streptomycin, was inserted into pBGS9 and transformed into Escherichia coli DH5 alpha. A 4.7-kb insert of pJML1, one of the transformants, was partially sequenced and found to contain the right section of transposon Tn3 from the middle of the TnpR resolvase gene to the right inverted repeat RI(R), including the TEM-1 gene. Sequences identical to RSF1010 were found on either side of the Tn3 sequence. pJML1 also contained a streptomycin resistance gene, probably identical to that of RSF1010. A portion of the pJML1 insert was not homologous to either Tn3 or RSF1010 but was homologous to the chromosomal DNA of E. corrodens ATCC 23834. It is assumed that the insert of pJML1 was derived from the chromosomal DNA of E. corrodens EC-38.
