The underlying immunopathogenic mechanism of CVID has been suspected to involve a chronic viral infection or an autoimmune condition. However, formal proof of viral infection is lacking. Measurement of MxA-protein in leucocyte lysates is a sensitive test for evaluating the activation of the host's interferon system. Both viral infections and autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) strongly induce MxA-protein in peripheral leucocytes. We therefore examined 15 patients with longlasting hypogammaglobulinaemia for MxA-protein induction in vivo: 13 patients suffered from CVID, one from hyper-IgM syndrome, and one patient had chronic B lymphocytic leukaemia associated with immunoglobulin deficiency and chronic papilloma virus infection (condylomata accuminata). Only the latter patient exhibited a strong MxA-protein expression; two CVID patients were borderline positive, and the remaining 12 patients including the hyper-IgM syndrome were MxA-protein-negative. There was no relationship between MxA expression and low CD4/CD8 ratios or increased CD8/CD57+ T cell counts, although both conditions are often observed in CVID as well as in chronic viral infections. When exposed in vitro to interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha), peripheral blood leucocytes of four MxA-negative patients were capable of producing normal amounts of MxA-protein. Taken together, these results argue against a viral or autoimmune pathogenesis of CVID.
