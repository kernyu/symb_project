Biotyping, slime production, antibiograms, extrachromosomal DNA banding and total DNA restriction analysis were used to characterize Staphylococcus epidermidis strains causing cerebrospinal fluid shunt infections in 11 patients. Infections considered to be community acquired and those acquired in the first 2 weeks of hospital admission were due to oxacillin-susceptible isolates. Multiply resistant strains were isolated from patients who were in hospital for more than 1 month before tube implantation. Slime was detected in staphylococci for 54% of cases, but its expression varied. Strains from different patients could be differentiated from one another by the extrachromosomal DNA bandings and total DNA restriction patterns, but isolates from the same patient were usually similar. During the period of external drainage, epidemiological markers were useful in differentiating persistence of infection from contamination or re-infection by a new strain.
