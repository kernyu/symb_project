Murine Mx1 protein, an interferon-inducible nuclear protein present in inbred mouse Mx+ strains, confers resistance to influenza virus infection. The purified Mx1 protein was found to carry the activities of both GTPase and GTP-binding. Enzymatic properties of the Mx1-associated GTPase were examined using the Mx1 protein purified from Escherichia coli expressing Mx1 cDNA. The Mx1 protein exhibited a substrate preference for GTP. The Vmax of ATP hydrolysis was about 7.6% the rate of GTP hydrolysis. The hydrolysis of CTP and UTP was virtually negligible. The Km for GTP hydrolysis was 667 microM and the rate was 13.8 mol GTP hydrolysis per min per mol Mx1 protein. The enzymatic properties of Mx1 protein-associated GTPase were compared with those of the GTPase super-gene family and the Mx-related family.
