The sensitivity of 95 strains of N. gonorrhoeae to antibiotics was determined. In 1990, among 18 strains of N. gonorrhoeae, 7 (38.90%) were resistant to Penicillin G, 3 (16.66%) to Gentamicin, 8 (44.44%) Kanamycin, 8 (44.44%) Midecamycin. In 1992, among 77 strains of N. gonorrhoeae, 61 (79.22%) were resistant to Penicillin G, 38 (49.35%) to Gentamicin, 62 (80.52%) to Kanamycin, 54 (70.13%) to Midecamycin, 56 (72.72%) to Ampicillin 60 (77.92%) to Erythromycin, 22 (28.57%) to Cefazolin, 18 (23.37%) to Cefotaxime. The results showed that Cefazolin and Cefotaxime were the most effective antibiotics, Gentamicin was the next.
