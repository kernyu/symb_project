An epidemic outbreak of Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA) infections affecting liver transplantation patients was detected in our hospital. In this study we describe the special characteristics of the infections and the results of prophylactic treatment with Vancomycin. Between april 1990 and december 1991, 47 patients with mean age of 54.4 +/- 10 years underwent liver transplantation. The patients were included in two chronological groups: 1) Group I: 20 patients not treated prophylactically with Vancomycin; 2) Group II: 27 consecutive patients treated with Vancomycin. Systematical cultures of body fluids for bacteria and fungi were done in every patient, and were repeated after 24 hours. The cultures were repeated again in case of sepsis. Group I patients had a significantly higher frequency of MRSA infections than group II patients. Furthermore, in patients with MRSA infection, independently of the group, duration of transplantation (p < 0.01), reoperations (p < 0.001) and prophylactic treatment with Vancomycin (p < 0.001) were significative factors. In conclusion, Vancomycin appears to be an elective prophylactic antibiotic in case of high risk of MRSA sepsis after liver transplantation.
