Among 418 blood culture isolates of viridans group streptococci obtained between 1995 and 1997, the in vitro rates of nonsusceptibility to penicillin, erythromycin, tetracycline, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole were 28, 29, 24, and 14%, respectively. The most prevalent group (125 strains) was Streptococcus mitis, followed by Streptococcus sanguis (56 strains). For 236 (56%) strains resistant to one or more antibiotics, the ciprofloxacin MIC at which 90% of the isolates were inhibited (MIC(90)) was 4 microg/ml, whereas the MIC(90)s of trovafloxacin, grepafloxacin, and gatifloxacin were 0.25 microg/ml.
