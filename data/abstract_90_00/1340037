Among S. typhimurium and S. agona strains isolated during the period from 1971 to 1987, the biotypes, colicine types and resistance patterns were determined for 734 S. typhimurium and 631 S. agona strains. Among 734 S. typhimurium strains 65 biotypes were disclosed with prevalence of biotypes 1a (28.34%), 1b (29.84%) and 9 bi (18.28). Concerning S. agona, the biotype 1a represented by 87.16%, was the commonest clone among our strains. Although colicine typing added little information to characterize these serotypes, it should be usefull when applied in epidemiological study of outbreaks. It was observed multiply antimicrobial resistance mainly among human strains, particularly from nosocomial origins.
