Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis are organisms that frequently cause conjunctivitis, keratitis and endophthalmitis. MRSA comprised about 25% of the S. aureus isolated from ocular infections; most were from compromised host. MRSA was resistant to penicillins, cephems and macrolides but was sensitive to amikacin, netilmicin, minocycline and ofloxacin. Ofloxacin-resistant strains, however increased rapidly. Topical vancomycin, arbekacin and minocycline were used when commercially available antibiotics were inadequate.
