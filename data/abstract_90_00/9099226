Six derivatives of sixteen-membered macrolides possessing 4-O-acyl-alpha-L-cladinose as a neutral sugar were synthesized via 3"-methylthiomethyl ether intermediates in reasonable yield. Introduction of a methyl group on the 3"-hydroxyl group of midecamycin A1 was effective for enhancing its antibacterial activity. All these derivatives exhibited excellent therapeutic effects in mice, and some of them showed improved pharmacokinetics compared with the natural antibiotics (mycarose type) in mice. Facile synthesis of 9-O-acylated analogues are also described.
