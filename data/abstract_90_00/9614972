The technique of X-ray diffraction has been successfully applied to enzymes associated with peptidoglycan biosynthesis. The technique has taught us a great deal about the structures and catalytic mechanisms of penicillin-binding proteins and beta-lactamases. An insight into the structural basis for antibiotic resistance is given.
