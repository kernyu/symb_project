BACKGROUND: Cyclosporine A (CyA) is ususally the immunosuppressive drug of choice in organ transplantation; however, some side effects have limited its use. Tacrolimus is a novel immunosuppressive drug that is more potent than CyA, and has been used as a rescue agent following heart transplantation when the use of CyA is undesirable or inefficient. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Since 1996, 14 heart transplant recipients under CyA were switched to tacrolimus therapy, for refractory rejection or intolerance, to conventional immunosuppression. RESULTS: After a mean of 35+/-7 months of treatment, tacrolimus was substituted for CyA therapy. The reason for substitution was refractory rejection in six patients, gingival hypertrophy in five patients, hypertrichosis in one patient, severe arterial hypertension in one patient and hepatotoxicity in one patient. Five patients underwent a successful rescue therapy and one patient died of refractory rejection despite the use of tacrolimus. All patients with CyA side effects recovered with tacrolimus. After conversion from CyA to tacrolimus, the number of episodes of acute rejection decreased from a mean of 0.42+/-0.17 to 0.14+/-0.09 episodes/patient/month under CyA and tacrolimus therapy (P=0.11), respectively. The mean dose of prednisone was 0.18+/-0.06 mg/kg/day before compared with 0.06+/-0.01 mg/kg/day after conversion from CyA to tacrolimus (P=0.09). Creatinine serum levels averaged 124+/-7 mmol/L under CyA treatment compared with 113+/-7 mmol/L with tacrolimus therapy (P=0.002). CONCLUSION: In patients with refractory rejections or intolerance to CyA after heart transplantation, conversion to tacrolimus-based immunosuppression is safe and effective.
