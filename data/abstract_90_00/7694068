Of the class of the 1-[(2-hydroxyethoxy)methyl]-6-(phenylthio)-thymine (HEPT) derivatives, several congeners were found to inhibit (at 50% effective concentrations ranging from 0.02 to 0.6 microgram/ml) the replication of mutant human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) strains that had been selected for resistance against bis(heteroaryl)piperazine, tetrahydroimidazo[4,5,1-jk] [1,4]benzodiazepin-2(1H)-thiones (TIBO), nevirapine, [2',5'-bis-O-(tert- butyldimethylsilyl)-beta-D-ribofuranosyl]-3'-spiro-5''-(4''-amino- 1'',2'' -oxathiole-2'',2''-dioxide) (TSAO), or pyridinone and showed amino acid substitutions at positions 100, 103, 106, 138, and 181, respectively. When HIV-1 strains were selected for resistance against three different HEPT derivatives [i.e., HEPT and its derivatives 5-ethyl-1-ethoxymethyl-6-benzyluracil(E-EBU) and 5-ethyl-1-ethoxymethyl-6-(3,5-dimethylbenzyl)uracil (EBU-dM)], HEPT selected for the mutation 188-Tyr-->His, E-EBU for 181-Tyr-->Cys, and E-EBU-dM for 106-Val-->Ala, in the reverse transcriptase of the mutant viruses. These virus strains showed markedly decreased sensitivity to HEPT derivatives. Moreover, the HEPT-resistant virus strains also proved cross-resistant to virtually all other HIV-1-specific inhibitors, including TIBO, nevirapine, and TSAO.
