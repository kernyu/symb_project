The effects of pyronaridine and chloroquine on mature Plasmodium falciparum gametocytes were compared in 161 patients treated with chloroquine or pyronaridine. Neither pyronaridine nor chloroquine showed gametocytocidal activity. The relative risks of post-treatment gametocytemia after pyronaridine and chloroquine treatment in the presence of chloroquine-resistant isolates were 1.25 and 11.5, respectively, suggesting that the use of chloroquine was associated with a high risk of favoring post-therapeutic gametocytemia in chloroquine-resistant infections.
