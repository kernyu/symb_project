A continuous-culture system was developed to study changes in the structure of Staphylococcus epidermidis populations exposed to subminimum inhibitory concentrations of erythromycin. Continuous-culture experiments were carried out in a dextrose-free, tryptic soy broth medium supplemented with lactic acid and sodium lactate (MTSB-D). The multiresistant (penicillin-, tetracycline-, and erythromycin-resistant) S. epidermidis strain NRC853 was subjected to a series of experiments: (i) growth individually in continuous culture in the absence and presence of erythromycin and (ii) growth in mixed culture with the erythromycin-susceptible S. epidermidis strain NRC852 in the absence and presence of erythromycin. Strain NRC853 produced colony morphology variants during continuous culture in the presence of 0.05 and 0.1 microgram of erythromycin per ml. Variants (A, B, and C) were different from their wild-type parent on the basis of colony size, sector pattern, and/or the ability to transmit light. A variants rapidly lost a 2.7-MDa tetracycline resistance plasmid. B and C variants formed an ermC plasmid multimer series from unit size to a 16-mer and exhibited an approximately twofold increase in erythromycin MIC over that of the wild-type parent. They slowly lost the tetracycline resistance plasmid. The small-colony B variant demonstrated an increased virulence in the neonatal mouse weight gain test and an increase in fibronectin binding compared with the wild-type parent. The presence of a competing strain drastically increased the frequency of all variants.
