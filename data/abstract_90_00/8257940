1. After immunization, adult A/J mice are resistant and BALB/c mice are susceptible to MHV3 infection. After IFN gamma activation, only macrophages originating from A/J mice were able to partially restrict MHV3 growth. 2. When the binding of MHV3 and interferon (IFN) gamma to solubilized cytoplasmic and membrane macrophage proteins of mice was determined by ELISA, there was more binding of MHV3 to proteins extracted from BALB/c macrophages than to proteins extracted from A/J macrophages. When the proteins were obtained from IFN gamma-activated macrophages, decreased MHV3 binding was observed only in proteins originating from A/J macrophages. 3. ELISA showed a comparable binding of IFN gamma to A/J or BALB/c macrophage proteins. When the proteins were obtained from IFN gamma-activated macrophages, only IFN gamma-binding to A/J macrophage proteins was increased. 4. The results indicate a different expression and IFN gamma modulation of MHV3 receptors in macrophages from A/J and BALB/c mice, which directly correlated with their acquired resistance or susceptibility to MHV3 infection.
