The activity of eight antibiotics was studied against fifty Escherichia coli strains resistant to ampicilline from positive urine cultures. We compared the in vitro activity and the inhibitory power of urine. Three antimicrobial agents are the most active: pefloxacin, ofloxacin and cefotaxime. Then in activity order: pipemidic acid, cefixime, cefuroxime, amoxicilline-clavulanic acid and cefalotine.
