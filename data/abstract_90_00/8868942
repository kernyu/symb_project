We report here the case of a patient with myelodysplasia and concomitant tuberculosis. Refractory anemia with blasts excess diagnosis was based upon morphological and cytogenetical criterias (del 20q), and tuberculosis was diagnosed on a cervical lymph node biopsy. Hematological data remained stable without any specific treatment for several months, cell counts even normalized under antituberculosis tritherapy. Clinical and hematological worsening appeared 3 years later, 1 year after discontinuation of antituberculosis therapy. It was characterized by progressive bone marrow failure and transformation in acute myeloid leukaemia. Concomitantly tuberculosis relapsed. The association of antituberculosis therapy and polychemotherapy (daunorubicine and aracytine) did not allow to obtain a hematological remission. The relationship between tuberculosis and myelodysplasia is discussed.
