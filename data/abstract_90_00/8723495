Four strains of Candida albicans, isolated from two patients with AIDS who had undergone prolonged fluconazole therapy for oral candidiasis, were studied in a model of disseminated murine candidiasis. Pre- and posttreatment isolates from each patient were genetically related, and the fluconazole MICs for the strains had increased significantly, from 0.25 to 32 micrograms/ml for the strains isolated from patient 1 and from 1.0 to 16 micrograms/ml for the strains isolated from patient 2. Mice were infected intravenously and were treated orally with fluconazole. For survival studies, mice were treated from day 1 to day 10 postinfection and were observed through day 30. The fluconazole dosages were as follows: 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, and 5.0 mg/kg of body weight twice a day. For tissue burden studies, two groups of mice (each group received fluconazole at 0.25 or 5.0 mg/kg) were treated from day 1 to day 7 and were sacrificed 1 day later for quantitative tissue cultures of the spleen and both kidneys. For pretreatment isolates from both patients, all fluconazole dosing regimens were effective at prolonging survival compared with the survival of the control groups. For posttreatment isolates, only fluconazole at 5.0 mg/kg was effective at prolonging survival. Both fluconazole dosing regimens used in the tissue burden studies significantly reduced the counts of the pretreatment isolate from patient 1 in the spleen and kidney, while fluconazole at 5.0 mg/kg was effective at reducing the counts of the posttreatment isolate. For both isolates from patient 2, only fluconazole at 5.0 mg/kg was effective at reducing the counts in the spleen and kidney. The study indicates that C. albicans mutation to resistance to fluconazole may play a critical role in fluconazole-refractory oral candidiasis in AIDS patients.
