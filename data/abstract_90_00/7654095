Susceptibility of 180 strains of anaerobic organisms to ampicillin, cefoperazone and their combinations with sulbactam, as well as that to cefoxitin, imipenem and metronidazole was studied with the method of serial microdilutions. 100 per cent of the strains was susceptible to the ampicillin + cefoperazone combination. Only 1 strain of Bacteroides fragilis was resistant to imipenem. 73.4 and 57.8 per cent of the B. fragilis strains were susceptible to cefoxitin and cefoperazone respectively. No resistance to metronidazole was detected. 100 per cent of the strains belonging to Bacteroides spp. fragilis (gr.) and Prevotella spp. was resistant to all the antibiotics except ampicillin. Gram-positive anaerobic cocci were susceptible to all the antibiotics. The strains of Actinomyces spp. and Propionibacterium acnes were resistant to metronidazole. Only 48.7 per cent the Actinomyces strains was susceptible to cefoxitin.
