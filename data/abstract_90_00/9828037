The reemergence of tuberculosis and closely related diseases as significant public health problems is briefly reviewed with particular emphasis on the exacerbating role of AIDS and multiple drug resistance. Screening methods available for discovering new chemical entities active against resistant strains are discussed and their use in screening extracts and compounds for activity is illustrated with a number of newly discovered structures being presented. In particular, the properties of the potent and structurally novel indoloquinazolinone alkaloid, tryptanthrin, is described. Many analogs of this lead structure were synthesized by combinatorial and multiple parallel synthetic techniques and evaluated in vitro and in vivo for their potential in the chemotherapy of human infections.
