Possible involvement of reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide in the pathogenesis of human essential hypertension was investigated. It was observed that both superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide production by polymorphonuclear leukocytes and the plasma levels of lipid peroxides are higher in uncontrolled essential hypertension compared with normal controls. Nitric oxide levels measured as its stable metabolite nitrite, as an index of nitric oxide synthesis, revealed its levels to be low in hypertensive patients. Superoxide anion, hydrogen peroxide, lipid peroxides and nitric oxide levels reverted to normal values after the control of hypertension by drugs. The concentrations of anti-oxidants such as vitamin E and superoxide dismutase were found to be decreased in patients with uncontrolled hypertension. Several anti-hypertensive drugs inhibited lipid peroxidation in vitro. Angiotensin-II, a potent vasoconstrictor, stimulated free radical generation in normal leukocytes which could be blocked by calmodulin antagonists. These results suggest that an increase in free radical generation and a simultaneous decrease in the production of nitric oxide and anti-oxidants such as SOD and vitamin E occurs in essential hypertension. This increase in free radical generation can inactivate prostacyclin and nitric oxide and decrease their half life which can lead to an increase in peripheral vascular resistance and hypertension.
