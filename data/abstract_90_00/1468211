The effect of topical amikacin or topical ciprofloxacin on Mycobacterium fortuitum keratitis was studied in a rabbit model. Two strains of M fortuitum were used: ATCC-6841 [for which mean inhibitory concentrations (MICs) indicated in vitro sensitivity to both drugs] and a cutaneous isolate from a human infection (for which MICs indicated relative in vitro resistance to amikacin but in vitro sensitivity to ciprofloxacin). Both drugs reduced the number of organisms in eyes infected with either strain (all p values < or = 0.01), but in no cases were organisms eliminated from eyes after 4 days of treatment. Amikacin was more effective in reducing the number of organisms in corneas infected with ATCC-6841 than in corneas infected with the patient isolate (p = 0.004), whereas ciprofloxacin was equally effective for treatment of both strains (p > 0.10). These results suggest that topical amikacin or ciprofloxacin may be useful in the treatment of M fortuitum keratitis. However, neither drug was shown to be more effective for treatment of either strain studied (all p values > 0.3).
