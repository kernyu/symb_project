To identify plant defense components that are important in restricting the growth of virulent pathogens, we screened for Arabidopsis mutants in the accession Columbia (carrying the transgene BGL2-GUS) that display enhanced disease susceptibility to the virulent bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. maculicola (Psm) ES4326. Among six (out of a total of 11 isolated) enhanced disease susceptibility (eds) mutants that were studied in detail, we identified one allele of the previously described npr1/nim1/sai1 mutation, which is affected in mounting a systemic acquired resistance response, one allele of the previously identified EDS5 gene, and four EDS genes that have not been previously described. The six eds mutants studied in detail (npr1-4, eds5-2, eds10-1, eds11-1, eds12-1, and eds13-1) displayed different patterns of enhanced susceptibility to a variety of phytopathogenic bacteria and to the obligate biotrophic fungal pathogen Erysiphe orontii, suggesting that particular EDS genes have pathogen-specific roles in conferring resistance. All six eds mutants retained the ability to mount a hypersensitive response and to restrict the growth of the avirulent strain Psm ES4326/avrRpt2. With the exception of npr1-4, the mutants were able to initiate a systemic acquired resistance (SAR) response, although enhanced growth of Psm ES4326 was still detectable in leaves of SAR-induced plants. The data presented here indicate that eds genes define a variety of components involved in limiting pathogen growth, that many additional EDS genes remain to be discovered, and that direct screens for mutants with altered susceptibility to pathogens are helpful in the dissection of complex pathogen response pathways in plants.
