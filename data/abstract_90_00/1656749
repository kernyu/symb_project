Nosocomial pathogens frequently are resistant to antimicrobial agents. Although methicillin-resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus continue to be a major problem in many hospitals, several new types of resistance determinants have been noted among organisms causing hospital-acquired infections. The mechanisms include extended spectrum beta-lactamases in gram-negative bacilli; resistance to beta-lactams, glycopeptides, and high levels of aminoglycosides among enterococci; quinolone resistance in isolates of methicillin-resistant S. aureus; and the spread of multiple resistance genes simultaneously in gram-negative organisms via Tn21-related genetic elements. These novel mechanisms of resistance complicate the treatment of nosocomial infections by limiting the number of effective antimicrobial agents available to the clinician. It is important for infection control practitioners and microbiologists to work together to detect and control the spread of resistant pathogens in the hospital setting.
