Radiation-inactivation studies were performed in order to elucidate the oligomeric nature of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) expressed in brain capillaries and renal brush border membranes (BBMs). Irradiation of renal BBMs resulted in a dose-dependent loss of P-gp, which corresponded to a target size (TS) of 255 and 211 kDa, as detected by Western blot and [125I]arylazidoprazosin labeling, respectively. Similar TSs were determined for P-gp expressed in brain capillaries. These TSs correspond to approximately twice the size (120 kDa) of deglycosylated P-gp. Furthermore, the estimated TS for P-gp was not significantly different when renal BBMs were incubated with SDZ-PSC 833 (PSC) prior and during exposure to ionizing radiation. To confirm these results, the size of P-gp was evaluated from its mobility on blue-native polyacrylamide gels followed by Western blot analysis. Using this method, an apparent molecular size of 334 and 264 kDa was determined for P-gp in brain capillaries and renal BBMs, respectively. This corresponds to approximately twice the size of the glycosylated monomeric subunit of P-gp in brain capillaries (162 kDa) or renal BBMs (140 kDa). P-gp expressed in renal BBMs isolated from rats which had been treated daily with cyclosporin A (CsA) or PSC also migrated as a 264 kDa protein. These results suggest that P-gp exists mainly as a dimer in normal tissues and that resistance modulators such as CsA and PSC do not alter its oligomeric state.
