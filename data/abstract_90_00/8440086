Between February and July 1989, stool samples from 100 diarrhoeic patients were screened for Aeromonas species. For isolation, alkaline peptone water was used for enrichment and xylose desoxycholate citrate agar as differential and selective medium. Only one sample (1%) yielded Aeromonas hydrophila having come from a 2-month old baby. No other enteric pathogens were isolated from the positive stool sample, a strong indication that A. hydrophila was responsible for the diarrhoea in the baby. Of nine antimicrobial agents used the lone A. hydrophila isolate was resistant only to ampicillin.
