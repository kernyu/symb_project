The cell death response known as the hypersensitive response (HR) is a central feature of gene-for-gene plant disease resistance. A mutant line of Arabidopsis thaliana was identified in which effective gene-for-gene resistance occurs despite the virtual absence of HR cell death. Plants mutated at the DND1 locus are defective in HR cell death but retain characteristic responses to avirulent Pseudomonas syringae such as induction of pathogenesis-related gene expression and strong restriction of pathogen growth. Mutant dnd1 plants also exhibit enhanced resistance against a broad spectrum of virulent fungal, bacterial, and viral pathogens. The resistance against virulent pathogens in dnd1 plants is quantitatively less strong and is differentiable from the gene-for-gene resistance mediated by resistance genes RPS2 and RPM1. Levels of salicylic acid compounds and mRNAs for pathogenesis-related genes are elevated constitutively in dnd1 plants. This constitutive induction of systemic acquired resistance may substitute for HR cell death in potentiating the stronger gene-for-gene defense response. Although cell death may contribute to defense signal transduction in wild-type plants, the dnd1 mutant demonstrates that strong restriction of pathogen growth can occur in the absence of extensive HR cell death in the gene-for-gene resistance response of Arabidopsis against P. syringae.
