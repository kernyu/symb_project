The treatment of Helicobacter pylori (H.p.) infection is based on the recommendations of the Maastricht consensus conference 1996. The main indications for eradication of H.p. are peptic ulcer disease, gastritis with severe histological abnormalities, low grade gastric MALT lymphoma and a history of resection for gastric cancer. The results of recent studies demonstrate that the symptoms of non-ulcer dyspepsia are not improved by H.p. eradication. A family history of gastric cancer and an earlier operation for peptic ulcer are considered advisable indications for the treatment of H.p. infection. Triple therapies consisting of a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) or ranitidine bismuth citrate plus 2 antibiotics are established as effective and well-tolerated first line regimens. The most important antibiotics are clarithromycin and amoxicillin. The efficacy of metronidazole is impaired by an increasing rate of resistant strains. Only few new antibiotics are currently tested in clinical trials. After the failure of a first anti-H.p. treatment it is advisable to change antibiotics according to the probability of resistance, to increase dosage and duration of treatment and to include bismuth compounds in the second line regimen. An alternative option after failed triple therapies may be a high dosage and prolonged dual regimen with a PPI and amoxicillin or quadruple therapy consisting of a PPI, bismuth subcitrate, tetracycline and metronidazole.
