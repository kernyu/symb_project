From January 1991 to July 1993, 58 patients with MRSA infections in our clinic at Wakayama Medical College and six affiliated hospitals were administered with arbekacin (ABK). The clinical results were as follows: 1. The clinical efficacy rates of ABK were 84% in pneumonia, 100% in both wound infections and hepatobiliary tract infections, and 85% in total. The bacteriological efficacy rate was 83%. 2. Regarding the administration route, the clinical efficacy rates were 60-79% by the intravenous treatment and inhalation therapy. Especially by the local administration with ABK, MRSA was eradicated in all cases. 3. The sufficient efficacy was obtained by the treatment of ABK alone (89%) and by the combined treatment with ABK (82%) and another antibiotics. From these results, it is concluded that ABK is useful for the treatment of MRSA infections after gastrointestinal surgery.
