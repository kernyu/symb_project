BACKGROUND: The decision to institute antibiotic therapy is often empirical and based on historical precedent. As respiratory tract infections are the commonest reason for prescribing antibiotics and bacterial resistance to many drugs is increasing, it is important to look at the evidence for using antibiotics. OBJECTIVE: This article reviews the various components of the respiratory tree addressing the indications for instituting antibiotic therapy and the most appropriate antibiotic. DISCUSSION: The information contained in this article is based on the 10th edition of the Therapeutic Guidelines: Antibiotics. It is acknowledged that the decision of when and which antibiotics to prescribe must be made on an individual basis, however, by considering the broader ramifications of antibiotic use and the evidence of outcome studies, the decision can be based on a more rational approach.
