A total of 114 opportunistic bacteria were isolated from 65 swabs from burn sepsis. P. aeruginosa (53.8%) was the most common agent followed by S. aureus (38.4%), Klebsiella Spp. (27.6%), Proteus (18.4%), E. coil (10.7%) and others. The infection was monobacterial in 25 cases (38.4%) and polybacterial in 49 cases (61.5%). P. aeruginosa was predominated in both monobacterial and polybacterial infections. Ciprofloxacin (42.9%) was found to be the most effective antibacterial agent. Results indicate that resistance in burn isolates is higher and increasing day by day.
