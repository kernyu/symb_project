Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of rokitamycin (R) were evaluated by agar dilution for 914 bacterial strain isolated in 4 hospitals and classed as a function of susceptibility and resistance to Macrolides-Lincosamides-Streptogramines group (MLS). MICs of R ranged from 0.06 to 1 microgram/ml (mode MIC 0.25-0.5) on Staphylococci susceptible to MLS and on MLSB inducible strains; R was inactive on MLSB constitutive strains. MICs of R ranged from 0.008 to 0.5 microgram/ml (mode MIC 0.06 to 0.25) for Streptococci and Pneumococci susceptible to erythromycin (E) and from 0.06 to greater than 128 for strains resistant to E. Enterococci susceptible to E were inhibited by 0.06 to 0.5 microgram/ml (mode MIC 0.5) and strains resistant to E by 0.25 to greater than 128. Haemophilus were inhibited by 0.5 to 0.65 microgram/ml (mode MICs of R ranged generally from 0.016 to 0.5 microgram/ml (mode MIC 0.12) for C. perfringens and from 0.016 to 1 (mode MIC 0.06) for B. fragilis. Thus, R was shown to be among macrolide antibiotics of resistance strains. Its activity was superior to that of other products of this group spiramycin, josamycin, miokamycin, particularly on Gram positive cocci. R had a good activity on Neisseria, Branhamella, anaerobes and, as others macrolides, was poorly active on Haemophilus.
