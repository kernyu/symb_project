The problem of international spread of bacterial resistance requires development of a strategy at worldwide or at least at European level. Clinically relevant monitoring systems for resistance and use of antibiotics have to be implemented to support the guidelines on prescription of antibiotics. Every hospital should establish an 'antibiotics team' controlling the prescription of antimicrobials and the observance of local formulary agreements. Veterinary use of growth promoting antimicrobials related to substances used in human medicine should be terminated. Future research should be aimed at resolving the problem of resistance to antimicrobials.
