Clinical, microbiological and immunological examinations were made of ailing children with localized (fauces) and spread (fauces, skin, intestine) staphylococcal lesions. The clinicogenealogical analysis revealed considerable hereditary aggravation as regards immune pathology, the presence of immunopathological diatheses, and a high level of dysembryogenesis stigmas in the given children's group. S. aureus and S. epidermidis were identified. In ailing children, the authors proved the persistence of ubiquitary staphylococcus, giving rise to the deficiency of immune factors consumption as related to the characteristics of antigenic adaptation of such children. Immunologic tolerance was found to fail at one of the crucial periods of immunity, with the opsonocytophagic component appearing to be the site of application of the suppressant action of Staphylococcus.
