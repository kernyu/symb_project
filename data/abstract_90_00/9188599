Two rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) Mx cDNAs were cloned by using RACE (rapid amplification of cDNA ends) PCR and were designated RBTMx2 and RBTMx3. The deduced RBTMx2 and RBTMx3 proteins were 636 and 623 amino acids in length with molecular masses of 72 and 70.8 kDa, respectively. These proteins, along with the previously described RBTMx1 protein (G. D. Trobridge and J. A. Leong, J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 15:691-702, 1995), have between 88.7 and 96.6% identity at the amino acid level. All three proteins contain the tripartite GTP binding domain and leucine zipper motif common to Mx proteins. A monospecific polyclonal antiserum to an Escherichia coli-expressed fragment of RBTMx3 was generated, and that reagent was found to react with all three rainbow trout Mx proteins. Subsequently, endogenous Mx production in RTG-2 cells induced with poly(IC) double-stranded RNA was detected by immunoblot analysis. The cellular localization of the rainbow trout proteins was determined by transient expression of the RBTMx cDNAs in CHSE-214 (chinook salmon embryo) cells. A single-cell transient-transfection assay was used to examine the ability of each Mx cDNA clone to inhibit replication of the fish rhabdovirus infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNV). No significant inhibition in the accumulation of the IHNV nucleoprotein was observed in cells expressing either trout Mx1, Mx2, or Mx3 in transiently transfected cells.
