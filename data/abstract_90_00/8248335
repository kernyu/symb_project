Photodynamic therapy (PDT) generates reactive oxygen species that are responsible for the initial cytotoxic events produced by this treatment. An extended (16 h) porphyrin incubation prior to light irradiation increased expression of the 75, 78 and 94 kDa glucose-regulated stress proteins (GRP), as well as the cognate form of the 70 kDa heat shock protein. However, these stress proteins were not induced following isoeffective PDT doses using a short (1 h) porphyrin incubation protocol. In the current study, Chinese hamster fibroblasts were used to examine sensitivity to adjunctive PDT and adriamycin as previous reports indicate a correlation between stress protein synthesis and a decrease in adriamycin cytotoxicity. Treatments that either induced GRP (i.e. PDT with an extended porphyrin incubation or exposure to the calcium ionophore A23187) or did not induce GRP (i.e. PDT with a short porphyrin incubation or UV irradiation) were followed at increasing time intervals with a 1 h adriamycin incubation. A time-dependent decrease in adriamycin cytotoxicity was observed when cells were first exposed to either of the PDT protocols or to A23187. Alterations in intracellular drug levels did not account for the change in adriamycin sensitivity. Likewise, intracellular glutathione concentrations and antioxidant enzyme activities were not significantly altered following PDT or A23187. Parameters associated with altered adriamycin sensitivity included a decrease in the percentage of S phase cells following PDT and A23187 as well as a depletion of intracellular ATP after PDT using the extended porphyrin incubation. These results demonstrate that PDT can be added to the growing list of diverse stresses producing transient resistance to adriamycin and that stress protein induction is not universally associated with all oxidative treatments inducing this resistance.
