To determine the role of neutrophil elastase in asthmatic responses, we studied the effect of ONO-5046, a specific neutrophil elastase inhibitor, on antigen-induced asthmatic responses in allergic sheep. Pulmonary resistance (RL) was measured for 8 h after antigen challenge. Measurements of airway responsiveness to methacholine and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were obtained 8 h after challenge. Antigen challenge caused early and late increases in RL, airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR), and recruitment of neutrophils and eosinophils along with increases in TXB2 and LTB4 in BALF. ONO-5046 treatment significantly reduced both early and late bronchoconstriction, neutrophil recruitment, increases in LTB4 in BALF, and AHR. ONO-5046 post-treatment significantly reduced the increase in RL 8 h after antigen challenge. Another neutrophil elastase inhibitor, FR 134043, significantly reduced both early and late bronchoconstriction. ONO-5046 had little effect on calcium ionophore-induced LTB4 release from isolated neutrophils and whole blood obtained from drug-treated sheep. These findings suggest that neutrophil elastase is involved in antigen-induced bronchoconstriction and AHR mediated by neutrophil accumulation and 5-lipoxygenase products in allergic sheep.
