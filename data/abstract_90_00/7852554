The number of ampicillin-resistant enterococci (ARE) was noted to be increased at our teaching hospital. To determine the risk factors for acquiring this organism and to compare clinical outcomes, over a 5-month period 38 patients infected or colonized with ARE were compared with 76 patients, infected or colonized with ampicillin-susceptible enterococci (ASE). Risk factors included nosocomial acquisition, duration of hospitalization, admission to a medical service, prior antimicrobial therapy, and combination therapy for at least 7 days. The mortality rate of patients infected or colonized with ARE was higher than that of patients infected or colonized with ASE (34 versus 14%; P = 0.03), but most deaths did not appear to be related to enterococcal infection. Over a 2-year period, 16 patients with ARE bacteremia were also compared with 23 patients with ASE bacteremia. The risk factors associated with ARE bacteremia also included nosocomial acquisition, duration of hospitalization, and prior antimicrobial therapy. The mortality of patients with ARE bacteremia was also higher than that of patients with ASE bacteremia (81 versus 30%; P = 0.003), with most deaths being due to the underlying disease or a complication of it. Typing of ARE isolates by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis showed that two genotypes predominated in our institution. A prolonged hospital stay, exposure to multiple antimicrobial agents, and perhaps nosocomial transmission are important factors in acquiring ARE. The presence of ARE may also be a marker for poor outcome.
