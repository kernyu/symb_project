In order to evaluate antimicrobial activity of cefetamet (CEMT), minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of CEMT and control drugs were determined against Gram-negative rods mainly from complicated urinary tract infections examined in our laboratory from April to September of 1994. The results are summarized as follows; 1. The obtained strains were Citrobacter diversus 20, Citrobacter freundii 30, Enterobacter aerogenes 20, Enterobacter cloacae 30, Serratia marcescens 30, Proteus mirabilis 30, Proteus vulgaris 20 and Morganella morganii 30 strains, a total of 210 strains. 2. Excluding some resistant strains, the MIC-distribution showed showed that CEMT had strong antimicrobial activities against those strains from the MIC-distribution of this investigation. Compared to reports on CEMT in 1989, the MIC80 of CEMT in this investigation against clinical isolates were similar. The MIC50's of CEMT against E. aerogenes, S. marcescens, P. mirabilis, P. vulgaris and M. morganii in the previous examination were equal to or similar to the current results, but the MIC50's against C. freundii and E. cloacae were lower than the value of this report. The detection frequency of highly resistant strains of C. freundii and E. cloacae to cefteram and cefixime were similar to that of CEMT-resistant strains. Multiple drug resistant strains, among these bacterial species seemed to be increasing. 3. Compared to oral antibacterial agents of oxime cephems that were used in the past, CEMT showed higher peak values of urinary excretion concentration and higher blood levels were sustained for a longer period of time. CEMT-PI will be effective against urinary tract infections.
