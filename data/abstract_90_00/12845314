Urinary tract infections represent a very frequent pathology. An epidemiologic survey on 6632 urine samples has been performed in the years 1995/96 to verify the bacterial incidence and susceptibility to antimicrobial drugs in this period, and variations in the resistance patterns with respect to a previous study. The results suggest the importance of a constant epidemiological surveillance in the community setting.
