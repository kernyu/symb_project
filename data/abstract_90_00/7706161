Three hundred and forty-eight isolates of Candida spp. from patients treated at a regional infectious diseases unit for AIDS, immunocompromised patients admitted to the Hope Hospital and isolates referred from around the North West of England were tested for their in-vitro susceptibility to amphotericin B, fluconazole and flucytosine using standardized methods. Candida albicans comprised 73% of isolates, Candida glabrata 10% and Candida parapsilosis 7%. Ninety-six percent of isolates were susceptible to amphotericin B and resistance to > or = 12.5 mg/L fluconazole was found in 61 (17.5%) of the 348 isolates tested. Among isolates from patients with AIDS the incidence of fluconazole resistance was 33% whereas in other patients the incidence was only 11%. Flucytosine resistance was seen in only 12 (3.4%) isolates, 11 of which were C. albicans and in 6.5% of isolates from patients with AIDS. Resistance to fluconazole and flucytosine is now sufficiently prevalent among Candida spp. isolated from patients with AIDS to warrant routine susceptibility testing of yeast isolates.
