Antibiotic susceptibility of ten bacteria i.e. Neisseria catarrhalis, Salmonella typhi, S. enteritidis, Haemophilus influenzae, Bacillus subtilis, Pseudomonas fluorescence, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus vulgaris, Staphylococcus aureus and E. coli to twenty antibiotics i.e. cefpirom (30 mcg), ceftriaxone (30 mcg), erythromycin (15 mcg), doxycycline (30 mcg) lomefloxacin (10 mcg), sisomicin (30 mcg), vancomycin (30 mcg), augmentin (30 mcg), ampicillin (30 mcg), cotrimoxazole (25 mcg), cefotaxime (30 mcg), Chloramphenicol (30 mcg), cephalexin (30 mcg), tetracycline (30 mcg), ciprofloxacin (5 mcg), nitrofurantoin (300 mcg), nalidixic acid (30 mcg), pefloxacin (10 mcg), norfloxacin and ofloxacin (5 mcg) was studied to evaluate the antimicrobial efficacy of recently introduced second and third generation antibiotics. All the test strains were sensitive to pefloxacin, erythromycin, augmentin and chloramphenicol. Maximum resistance to cefpirom excluding E. coli and S. typhi and co-trimoxazole except S. typhi, Pseudomonas aeruginosa was observed, occasional resistance was seen against ceftriaxone, vancomycin and cefotaxime.
