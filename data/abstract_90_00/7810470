Genital herpes affects over 30 million persons in the United States. Genital herpes has three distinct presenting syndromes, depending on the patient's immune status with regard to the herpes simplex virus. Current diagnostic strategy relies on clinical findings and the selective use of viral culture. Acyclovir is the drug of choice for the treatment of genital herpes. Drug resistance is an increasing problem, requiring the use of newer agents. Treatment of the immunocompromised patient is a special area of concern. In addition to the medical aspects in the treatment of genital herpes, psychosocial requirements should also be addressed.
