From January 1998 to June 1999, 302 clinical isolates of Streptococcus pyogenes were collected from 10 microbiology laboratories in Portugal. All strains were highly sensitive to penicillin (MIC90 = 0.012 mg/liter). The prevalence of erythromycin resistance was 35.8% and of tetracycline resistance 41.4%. The majority (79.6 %) of erythromycin-resistant strains were of the MLSB constitutive resistance (CR) phenotype with high-level resistance to erythromycin (MIC90 >256 mg/liter) and to clindamycin (MIC90 >256 mg/liter), 16.7% showed the M phenotype with low-level erythromycin-resistance (MIC90 = 24 mg/liter) and susceptibility to clindamycin, and four isolates showed a phenotype characterized by low-level erythromycin resistance (MIC90 = 8 mg/liter) and high-level clindamycin resistance (MIC90 >256 mg/liter), not previously described. Erythromycin resistance was not associated with invasive strains. Only minor discrepancies between disk diffusion and E-test methods were observed. T serotyping was very useful for the epidemiological characterization of the strains. The most prevalent T types were T1, T4, T9, T12, T13, and T28. A statistically significant association with resistance patterns was found: T12 with erythromycin resistance MLS(B) CR phenotype (p< 0.001), T4 with erythromycin resistance M phenotype (p<0.001), and T13 with tetracycline resistance (p<0.01). Because of the high prevalence of resistance, careful surveillance of S. pyogenes isolates in Portugal is essential, routine antimicrobial susceptibility testing in clinical microbiology laboratories should be strongly encouraged, antibiotic prescription should be reviewed, and macrolides should no longer be used in the empirical therapy of acute pharyngitis.
