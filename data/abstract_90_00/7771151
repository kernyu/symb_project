Wide circulation of antibiotic-resistant Vibrio cholerae strains again gives prominence to the problem of etiotropic therapy. The results of the treatment of 428 persons infected with V.cholerae (237 cholera patients and 191 Vibrio carriers) in different regions of Daghestan during the outbreak of epidemic in 1994 are presented. The main criterion of the effectiveness of antibacterial therapy was the determination of the percentage of bacterial relapses. The sensitivity of 118 V.cholerae strains to different antibacterial preparations was studied by the method of serial dilutions. After the clinical use of chloramphenicol 29.7% of bacterial relapses were registered, the in vitro resistance of V. cholerae being 32-64 mkg/ml. After the use of tetracycline 16.5% bacterial relapses were registered with in vitro resistance being the same. The use of the combination of these preparations gave 15% of bacterial relapses. Furazolidone gave 4.3% of bacteria relapses, while after the use of ciprofloxacin 2.8% of bacterial relapses were registered with in vitro sensitivity equal to 0.25-0.5 mkg/ml. Ciprofloxacin was recommended for the treatment of cholera patients and furazolidone, for the treatment of Vibrio carriers.
