In 142 strains of Staphylococcus aureus randomly isolated from clinical samples in a year, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) accounted for 79.6% (113/142). MRSA in the samples from the respiratory, burning and hematological departments came to 92.0% (23/25), 84.6% (11/13) and 83.3% (30/36) in proportion respectively. 79.6% of MRSA strains were isolated from the patients in whom the infections were confirmed to be hospital-acquired. All the strains of Staphylococcus aureus examined were resistant to penicillin G and ampicillin, but sensitive to vancomycin. Twenty hospital-acquired strains of MRSA showed a resistance to all detected antibiotics (multi-drug resistance, MDR), but vancomycin; strains of methicillin-sensitive ones, however, showed on MDR. In 45 strains of Staphylococcus aureus isolated from swabs of fingers of 62 medical workers, 31 (68.9%) were methicillin-resistant. The resistant similarity of shares of strains between medical staff and patients indicated a potential role that medical workers play in spread of nosocomial infections.
