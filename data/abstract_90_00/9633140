OBJECTIVE: To assess the frequency of Candida species others than Candida albicans isolation, in patients with chronic as well as relapsing vaginitis. To analyze the clinical pictures and the treatments routinely employed in patients with Candida albicans infection, compared to those with other Candida species infection, in a Primary Care Clinic. DESIGN: Prospective, comparative, transverse study. SETTING: Primary health center from January, 1995 to May, 1997. MATERIAL: Two hundred and thirty four women (234) in ages between 16 and 55 years, with cervicovaginitis and a positive culture to any species of Candida, were the subject of the present study. RESULTS: From the total of 234 patients studied, 142 (60.5%) were infected by Candida albicans and 92 (39.5%) by other Candida species; no difference in symptomatology was recorded in both groups. Nistatine alone or combined with imidazole derivatives were the antimycotics more commonly employed, with Candida albicans resistance of 9.6% in the first case and 11.2% in the second one. CONCLUSIONS: It is stressed the importance that has the identification of Candida species causing vaginitis. It is also acknowledged the well handled treatment, despite of the species to be treated.
