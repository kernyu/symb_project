The presence of quinolone efflux pumps was analyzed in clinical isolates of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. The presence of the protein Omp54, which is associated with the expression of multidrug resistant systems, was also tested. Western blot analysis of outer membrane proteins demonstrated that Omp54 was expressed in strains with high-level resistance to quinolones, whereas those strains with low MIC values did not express this protein. This result shows that Omp54 has an important role in the phenotype of quinolone resistance in clinical S. maltophilia isolates. Biochemical analyses have shown that clinical S. maltophilia strains are capable of quinolone efflux (namely norfloxacin, ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin). Quinolone efflux is dependent on the integrity of membrane potential. These data indicate the presence of active quinolone efflux pump systems in clinical S. maltophilia isolates.
