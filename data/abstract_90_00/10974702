The aim of this work was the construction of a cassette, i.e., a non-replicative molecule formed by linkage of an antibiotic resistance gene and a multiple cloning site. This cassette would allow the cloning and analysis of a wide range of replicons. The aac(6')-lc amikacin gene was isolated and ligated to the multiple cloning site of the pUC18 vector. This construction was HindIII digested and cloned in the HindIII site of the vector. The resulting pHJ13 clone conferred to the recipient cells the ability to grow in presence of amikacin (cassette marker) and ampicillin (vector gene). By restriction analysis, the cassette orientation was established. Cassette versatility is provided by the presence of the unaltered multiple cloning site segment, and also because it allows sequencing of any replication origin inserted. Cassette functionality was demonstrated by ligation to a replicative region of H plasmid pHH1457. Presence of the ori region from pHH1457 and the aac(6')-lc gene was confirmed in E. coli transformed clones. The incompatibility properties of the pHH1457 and its capability to replicate in a Poll defective strain were preserved in the pHJII14 construct. Currently, the amikacin cassette is being used in the characterization of H Complex plasmids.
