Antibiotic-impregnated beads are used in the dead bone space following debridement surgery to deliver local, high concentrations of antibiotics. Polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA), 2,000-molecular-weight (MW) polylactic acid (PLA), Poly(DL-lactide)-coglycolide (PL:CG; 90:10, 80:20, and 70:30), and the combination 2,000-MW PLA-70:20 PL:CG were individually mixed with clindamycin, tobramycin, or vancomycin. Beads were placed in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and incubated at 37 degrees C. The PBS was changed daily, and the removed PBS samples were stored at -70 degrees C until the antibiotic in each sample was determined by microbiological disk diffusion assay. Nondissolving PMMA beads with tobramycin and clindamycin had concentrations well above breakpoint sensitivity concentrations (i.e., the antibiotic concentrations at the transition point between bacterial killing and resistance to the antibiotic) for more than 90 days, but vancomycin concentrations dropped by day 12. ALl PLA, PL:CG, and the 2,000-MW PLA-70:30 PL:CG biodegradable beads release high concentrations of all the antibiotics in vitro for the period of time needed to treat bone infections (i.e., 4 to 8 weeks). Antibiotic-loaded PLA and PL:CG beads have the advantage of better antibiotic elution and the ability to biodegradable (thereby averting the need for secondary surgery for bead removal) compared to the PMMA beads presently used in the clinical setting.
