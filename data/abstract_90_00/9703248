Clinically-isolated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strain 743 exhibited resistance to tetracycline as judged from the active efflux of the drug. The efflux of tetracycline was inhibited by an uncoupler, carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP), and minocycline. Inhibitors of the efflux pump were examined in this strain to determine the cellular accumulation of tetracycline. Out of seven compounds examined, three caused a significant increase in the cellular concentration of tetracycline by inhibiting the efflux pump. Two of them seem to be energy inhibitors. Ro 07-3149 inhibited the efflux pump without affecting the energy state, and exhibited very low antibacterial activity but showed weak synergy with tetracycline.
