Hydroxyurea has been extensively used in medical practice, mainly for treating chronic myelogenous leukemia, sickle cell anemia, and other diseases. In light of its ability to inhibit DNA synthesis and to induce cell cycle arrest through inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase, the effects of hydroxyurea on replication of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) have been investigated. In vitro hydroxyurea has been shown to block HIV-1 reverse transcription and/or replication in quiescent peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and macrophages. Hydroxyurea was also found to be synergistic with the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor didanosine and to inhibit HIV-1 replication in activated PBMC; this inhibition may be due to a reduction in deoxynucleoside triphosphate pool sizes. Finally, hydroxyurea has been shown to sensitize didanosine-resistant mutants. Hydroxyurea may therefore be useful for limiting the spread of didanosine-resistant HIV-1 variants. The favorable toxicity profile of hydroxyurea and the lack of significant overlapping toxicities with some of the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, as well as their distinct mechanisms of action, have provided further rationale for use of these agents in combination therapies.
