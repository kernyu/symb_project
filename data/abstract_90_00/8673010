The stress response to reactive oxygen species is an important defence system which can reduce their potential to induce biomolecule damage. In this investigation the effect of exposing Molt-3 lymphoblastoid cells or peripheral blood lymphocytes to a non-toxic dose of hydrogen peroxide (10 microM) was studied. Cellular response to a subsequent high dose of hydrogen peroxide (100-200 microM) was assessed by measurement of growth, viability, proliferation and DNA damage (lymphocytes only) and intracellular activities of the enzymes, superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase and catalase (Molt-3 only). The results indicate that pretreatment of lymphocytes with 10 microM hydrogen peroxide can elicit a response which is protective against DNA damage normally inducible in these cells by subsequent exposure to toxic doses of hydrogen peroxide. It appears from the results with Molt-3 cells that altered activities of glutathione peroxidase may contribute to this enhanced resistance to hydrogen peroxide.
