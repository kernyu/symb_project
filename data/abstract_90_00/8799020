Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) is becoming an important cause of nosocomial infections. An outbreak of VRE in a burns unit, if it ever occurs, will be a catastrophe as vancomycin-resistance can potentially be transferred to other organisms like methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. We report a case of VRE in our burns centre in which it was detected and the patient isolated from other patients early. Measures to control the occurrence of VRE include the restriction of the use of vancomycin and the practice of other established infection-control measures.
