Two hundred and ten pneumococcal isolates underwent ceftizoxime disk (30 micrograms) screening to predict cephalosporin resistance. Forty-six isolates failed screening with 36 (78%) demonstrating intermediate/resistant MICs. Sensitivity and specificity were 100 and 95%, respectively. The ceftizoxime disk screen is an effective method of identifying potentially cephalosporin-resistant isolates.
