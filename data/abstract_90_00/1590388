The influences of intravascular ethanol on gastric mucosal integrity and its relation to gastric circulation were investigated in rats. Ulcer formation of the gastric mucosa correlated with the blood ethanol concentration in the presence of 150 mM HCl in the rat stomach. Furthermore, the gastric mucosal hemoglobin concentration (IHb) and hemoglobin oxygen saturation (ISO2), estimated using organ reflectance spectrophotometry, decreased in a concentration-dependent manner with blood ethanol. In isolated, vascularly perfused rabbit stomach, various concentrations (10-400 mM) of ethanol infused into the celiac artery increased the perfusion pressure and released endothelin-1 (ET-1) from the gastric vasculature in a concentration-dependent manner. Moreover, a significant correlation existed between changes in the perfusion pressure and ET-1 concentration in effluents from the gastric vasculature. Furthermore, anti-ET-1 antibody reduced 100 mM ethanol-induced vasoconstriction in a concentration-dependent manner. The results indicate that intravascular ethanol increases the susceptibility of gastric mucosa to injury induced by intraluminal HCl by causing gastric vasoconstriction mediated by ET-1. Thus intravascular ethanol may play an important role in the mechanism of ethanol-induced gastric mucosal injury.
