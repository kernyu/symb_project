A practical approach to detect and identify ceftazidime-hydrolyzing extended-spectrum mutants of OXA-10 beta-lactamase is presented. Large numbers of bacteria were screened by colony hybridization, a 720-bp part of blaOXA was amplified by PCR from the hybridization-positive isolates, and the products were digested by PvuII and HaeIII.
