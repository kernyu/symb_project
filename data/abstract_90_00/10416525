OBJECTIVE: To study the long-term effect of triple-drug therapy initiated at the time of primary HIV-1 Infection and to evaluate the persistance of replication-competent virus in responding patients. METHODS: Prospective open-label pilot study. Patients received a combination of zidovudine, didanosine and lamivudine. Viral sequencing of the reverse transcriptase gene was performed before therapy and during follow-up. HIV-1 RNA and DNA as well as CD4 and CD8 T lymphocyte subsets were measured in blood and in lymph node biopsies during therapy. Isolated blood CD4 T cells were cultured in conditions that improved HIV isolation. Three patients received in vivo interleukin-2 and gamma-interferon in order to try to identify intracellular pools of replication-competent virus. SETTING: A tertiary care general hospital. PATIENTS: Fifteen patients observed within 28 days following the acute retroviral syndrome. RESULTS: After a mean follow-up of 27.5+/-2.9 months, plasma RNA remained < 20 copies/ml (four patients), fluctuated between 20 and 120 copies/ml (six patients) or rebounded (five patients). M184V and/or T215Y mutations were demonstrated in two of these last five patients. Proviral DNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) decreased by an average of -1 log after 16+/-3 months, reaching undetectable levels in three patients. The culture of isolated CD4 T cells yielded virus in all but two patients. These last were characterized by a waning antibody reactivity on the Western blot, undetectable proviral DNA in PBMC and undetectable RNA in lymph nodes. Cytokine administration in vivo had no effect in one patient and unmasked plasma RNA in the other. Stopping therapy in the first patient led to a rebound in plasma RNA. CONCLUSION: Despite a lack of detectable plasma viral activity in some patients after 3 years of triple nucleoside therapy administered since the acute retroviral syndrome, replication-competent virus can still be demonstrated.
