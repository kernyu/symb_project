OBJECTIVE: To assess the prevalence of antibiotic resistance and serotype distribution among pneumococci in England and Wales in 1990 and 1995. DESIGN: Observational surveys in March 1990 and March 1995. During two weeks in each survey period all pneumococci isolated in public health laboratories in England and Wales were collected and assessed for sensitivity to antibiotics and the distribution of serogroups or serotypes. SETTING: The network of public health laboratories throughout England and Wales. SUBJECTS: 1127 individual patient isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae obtained during the two surveys. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Sensitivity or resistance to a range of antibiotics; serogroup or serotype. RESULTS: The prevalence of intermediate or full resistance to penicillin increased from 1.5% in 1990 to 3.9% in 1995 and resistance to erythromycin increased from 2.8% to 8.6%. About 92% of isolates belonged to serogroups or serotypes included in the currently available pneumococcal vaccine. CONCLUSION: Resistance to penicillin and erythromycin has increased among pneumococci in England and Wales. Continued surveillance to assess further increases in the prevalence of pneumococcal resistance to antibiotics is essential.
