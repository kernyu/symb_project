A cell suspension culture was established from a transgenic petunia (Petunia hybrida L.) plant which carried genes encoding neomycin phosphotransferase II (nptII) and beta-glucuronidase (uidA, GUS). Two selection experiments were performed to obtain cell lines with increased resistance to kanamycin. In the first, two independently selected cell lines grown in the presence of 350 micrograms/ml kanamycin were eight to ten-fold more resistant to kanamycin than unselected cells. Increased resistance was correlated with amplification of the nptII gene and an increase in nptII mRNA levels. Selection for kanamycin resistance also produced amplification of the linked GUS gene, resulting in increased GUS mRNA levels and enzyme activity. Selected cells grown in the absence of kanamycin for twelve growth cycles maintained increased copy numbers of both genes, and GUS enzyme activity was also stably overexpressed. In a second selection experiment, a cell line grown continuously in medium containing 100 micrograms/ml kanamycin exhibited higher nptII and GUS gene copy numbers and an increase in GUS enzyme activity after eleven growth cycles. In this cell line, amplification of the two genes was accompanied by DNA rearrangement.
