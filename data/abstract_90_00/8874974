A survey of the susceptibility of gram-negative bacilli isolated from cancer patients to broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents was conducted. The organisms were isolated from all patient specimens submitted to the microbiology laboratory during a 3-month study period. Overall, the least resistance was observed against cefoperazone/sulbactam, ciprofloxacin, and imipenem. Of these, cefoperazone/sulbactam has had limited usage at our institution. Drugs used more frequently (piperacillin, aztreonam, cefoperazone, ceftazidime) were associated with greater levels of resistance. Imipenem and ciprofloxacin have enjoyed wide usage but the level of resistance remains low.
