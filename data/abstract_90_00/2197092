Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae resistant to fluoroquinolones were isolated from an infected Hickman catheter in a 43-year-old diabetic patient who had previously been treated with a 24-day course of ciprofloxacin (200 mg/12 h i.v.). MICs and MBCs of nalidixic acid, norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, pefloxacin and fleroxacin were determined for the strains using the methodology recommended by the NCCLS. Both strains were resistant to all the quinolones tested. Since long-term treatment with quinolones might favour the emergence of quinolone resistance or colonization with quinolone-resistant organisms, it is important to monitor for the development of bacterial resistance during therapy with the new fluoroquinolones.
