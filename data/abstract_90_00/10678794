Improvements in the treatment of compromised patients have resulted in their prolonged survival in a debilitated state. Patients have repeated courses of antibiotics and become colonised with multiresistant pathogens during a stay in the intensive care unit. Surgical wound infections can then be very difficult to treat. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus is now common although wide variations in prevalence exist between countries and regions. Klebsiella spp with multiple resistance is a common cause of septicemia and can be associated with cephalosporin use. Acinetobacter spp and vancomycin-resistant enterococci can cause infections resistant to all readily available antibiotics. The prevalence of infection with each of these pathogens is increasing. Control measures should include hand washing, universal precautions for infection control, source isolation, restrictive antibiotic policy and antibiotic rotation. Although new agents currently in trials may be effective in the long term, the future for antibiotic treatment or prophylaxis of surgical infections is in doubt.
