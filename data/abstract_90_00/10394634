The accumulation of chitinase and its involvement in systemic acquired disease resistance was analyzed using acibenzolar-S-methyl and salicylic acid (SA). Resistance against scab (pathogen: Cladosporium cucumerinum) and the accumulation of chitinase were rapidly induced in cucumber plants after treatment with acibenzolar-S-methyl. In contrast, SA protected the plants from C. cucumerinum and the accumulation of chitinase was induced only on the treated leaves. The accumulation of chitinase in response to inoculation with the pathogen was induced more rapidly in cucumber plants previously treated with acibenzolar-S-methyl than in plants pretreated with SA or water. Thus, it appears that a prospective signal(s), that induces systemic resistance, can be transferred from leaves treated with acibenzolar-S-methyl to the untreated upper and lower leaves where systemic resistance is elicited. In contrast, exogenously applied SA is not likely to function as a mobile, systemic resistance-inducing signal, because SA only induces localized acquired resistance.
