WIDE-SPECTRUM beta-LACTAM PRODUCERS: A French survey demonstrated that Enterobacter aerogenes is currently the preferential host for this plasmid, apparently more so in general hospitals than in University hospitals. CANDIDEMIA: The highest rate of positive blood tests for candida was found in anti-cancer centers. VANCOMYCIN-RESISTANT STRAINS: Reduced susceptibility of methicillin-resistant staphylococci to vancomycin appears to be rather frequent (approximately 10% of strains isolated in one Japanese hospital). It is important to recognize germ populations with a homogeneous or heterogeneous pattern of resistance. In addition, a Spanish survey demonstrated that a large number of inpatients or outpatients harbor vancomycin-resistant enterococci. THE ACINETOBACTER ISSUE: In order to limit the emergence of multiresistant strains and control epidemics, a strong prevention program must be associated with an adapted policy for antibiotic use.
