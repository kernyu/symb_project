Intravitreal corticosteroids in the treatment of bacterial endophthalmitis remain controversial. We utilized an experimental rabbit model of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis endophthalmitis (i) to calculate the intravitreal vancomycin concentration in rabbit eyes receiving intravitreal vancomycin alone or in combination with intravitreal dexamethasone and (ii) to determine whether an intravitreal steroid has any effect on intravitreal vancomycin levels. All right eyes were infected and all left eyes were uninfected. The rabbits were divided into two treatment groups: (i) 32 eyes (group I) were injected with intravitreal vancomycin, 1.0 mg (0.1 ml); (ii) 32 additional eyes (group II) were injected with intravitreal dexamethasone, 400 micrograms (0.1 ml), in addition to vancomycin. Measurement of intravitreal vancomycin concentration was performed following sacrifice, utilizing a microbiologic agar diffusion assay. Analyses of intravitreal vancomycin concentrations were performed by using model-independent parameters, with area under the concentration-time curves derived by trapezoidal approximation. The intravitreal vancomycin concentration was significantly lower in both uninfected and infected group II eyes (P less than 0.002). Analysis of intravitreal vancomycin concentration-time relationships was performed by using a nonlinear least-squares regression program; data best fit a one-compartment model. In addition, no vancomycin-dexamethasone interaction could be demonstrated. The reduced level of intravitreal vancomycin in the presence of intravitreal dexamethasone may have important clinical implications.
