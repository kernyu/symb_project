The activity of cefoperazone with and without sulbactam was studied in vitro and in vivo against strains of methicillin-resistant and methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus. Cefoperazone with or without sulbactam was inactive in vitro against the methicillin-resistant strain and was bound by penicillin-binding protein 2a with an IC50 of 190 mg/L (the concentration that reduced radio-labelling with 3H-penicillin by 50%). Cefoperazone was hydrolysed by beta-lactamase in vitro but sulbactam improved cefoperazone activity in a rabbit model of aortic valve endocarditis caused by a beta-lactamase producing methicillin-susceptible strain.
