Cholangitis/cholangiopathy associated with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is characterized by chronic abdominal pain, low-grade fever, cholestasis, and sometimes areas of focal or diffuse dilatation of the bile ducts that may be apparent on noninvasive imaging studies. Although the etiology of this biliary disease may be multifactorial, it appears to be the result of immunosuppression and/or secondary opportunistic infections rather than a direct cytopathic effect of HIV itself. Various opportunistic pathogens, including cytomegalovirus, Cryptosporidium, Campylobacter fetus, and Candida albicans, have been implicated as causes of HIV-associated cholangitis. We report an unusual case of polymicrobial cholangitis and liver abscess in a patient with HIV infection.
