Phenotypic characteristics of 12 paired, Salmonella serotypes isolated from healthy and ill chickens were compared. Variables compared included antibiotic resistance profiles, production of colicins and siderophores, mannose-sensitive hemagglutination of erythrocytes, resistance to serum complement, carbon source utilization, presence and transmissibility of R plasmids, and invasiveness in primary chicken kidney cell culture. Differences were found between pairs for utilization of carbon sources, mannose-sensitive hemagglutination of erythrocytes, and invasiveness in cell culture.
