BACKGROUND: To facilitate the interpretation of data used in infection control and epidemiology, a novel data presentation format (the aromagram) has been developed and modified. METHODS: Aromagrams were developed with a personal computer-based graphics application. Aromagrams were based on antimicrobial susceptibility data from all specimen submitted to the University of California San Diego Medical Center's clinical microbiology laboratory between July 1992 and December 1994. RESULTS: The aromagrams created displayed both bacterial species-specific and antimicrobial agent-specific susceptibilities. Additional modified aromagrams incorporated costs of antimicrobial agents and temporal trends in susceptibility of individual species to selected antibiotics. CONCLUSIONS: The aromagram is a unique format for data presentation that can be used to illustrate antimicrobial susceptibilities (specific to both organisms and antimicrobial agents), temporal trends in susceptibility data, and antimicrobial costs. Aromagrams may be used to display data useful to infection control and epidemiology professionals and to clinicians.
