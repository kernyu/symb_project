Since the introduction of antibiotics in the 1940s, antibiotic resistance has become an increasing problem. Today, multiple-antibiotic resistance is commonly associated with a number of clinically important pathogens and is therefore an important issue in clinical nursing practice. Epidemiological studies identify a number of important factors associated with increases in antimicrobial resistance. These include patterns of antimicrobial use, changes in medical and veterinary care and social practices affecting the transmission of microbes. Bacterial mechanisms of antibiotic resistance and the genetics of resistance-gene transfer are explored, with the intention of developing nurses' knowledge and understanding of control measures.
