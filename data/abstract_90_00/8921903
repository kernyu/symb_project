Gene replacement was achieved by homologous recombination in Mycobacterium smegmatis (Ms) using a cloned segment of the polA gene (encoding the DNA polymerase I) disrupted within the region encoding the C-terminal DNA polymerase domain by a kanamycin-resistance marker. The Ms polA755:aph mutant thus generated displayed a phenotype of hypersensitivity to DNA damage induced by UV irradiation and by hydrogen peroxide challenge.
