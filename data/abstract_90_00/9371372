We evaluated the in vitro activities of clinafloxacin, CL331,002, LY333328, quinupristin dalfopristin, and eperezolid (formerly known as U-100,592) against four strains of enterococci. All regimens tested resulted in the growth inhibition of each isolate. Against the three clinafloxacin-susceptible strains, clinafloxacin tested alone was the most active treatment, decreasing the bacterial inoculum by more than 3 log10 CFU/ml after 24 h in time-kill curve studies.
