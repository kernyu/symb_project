Cyclosporine (CYA) reduces the renal synthesis of prostaglandins of the E series (PGE). Analogue of PGE1 have been shown to mitigate the vasoconstriction and abnormal renal function of experimental acute CYA nephrotoxicity. We examined the hypothesis that the orally bioavailable PGE analogue enisoprost (EP) would improve renal function in renal transplant recipients chronically exposed to CYA. In a randomized double-blind study, 40 patients at two centers who were being monitored for 3 to 30 months after renal transplantation, were allocated to receive either EP 100 micrograms orally four times daily or placebo (P) for 2 weeks. CYA dosing was fixed at existing levels. There could be no evidence of concurrent acute renal injury, including that of acute rejection. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was measured by the clearance of radiolabeled DTPA, while effective renal plasma flow (ERPF) was measured as the clearance of p-aminohippuric acid (PAH). The acute effects of EP were examined twice, by comparing immediate postdose to predose values for GFR and ERPF on day 1 and again on day 14. Chronic effects were examined by comparing baseline (predose) values only for GFR and ERPF between days 1 and 14 and by an examination of creatinine clearances (CCR) on days 0, 14, and 21. At enrollment, patients were well matched for renal function (CCR:EP 47 +/- 5 v P 49 +/- 4 mL/min/1.73 m2; P = NS). Baseline demographics were similar, although patients treated with EP were older (46 +/- 2 v 36 +/- 3 years, mean +/- SEM, P = 0.003). CYA doses and blood levels did not change significantly.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
