The efficacy of ivermectin, fenbendazole and levamisole was determined in lambs individually infected with 5000 third stage larvae of Teladorsagia (Ostertagia) species isolated from a herd of goats with a history of benzimidazole resistance and where the efficacy of ivermectin had also suffered an apparent decline. Efficacies, calculated using geometric means, for groups where treatments were directed against adult worms were 90.3 per cent (ivermectin), 43.4 per cent (fenbendazole) and 100 per cent (levamisole). The efficacy of ivermectin against immature stages was 83.2 per cent. Ivermectin was highly effective (99.9 per cent) against a known susceptible ovine strain of Teladorsagia.
