A genome project for the species Caenorhabditis elegans has demonstrated the presence of eight cDNAs belonging to the major intrinsic protein (MIP) family. We previously characterized one of these cDNAs known as C01G6.1. C01G6.1 was confirmed to be a water channel and newly designated as AQP-CE1 [Am. J. Physiol. 275 (1998) C1459-C1464]. In this paper, we examined the function of another MIP protein encoded by F40F9.9. This cDNA encodes a 274-amino acid protein showing a high sequence identity with mammalian aquaporin-8 (AQP8) water channel (35%) and d-TIP (34%), an AQP of Arabidopsis. The expression of F40F9.9 in Xenopus oocytes increased the osmotic water permeability (P(f)) 10.4-fold, and the activation energy for P(f) from Arrhenius plot was 4.7 kcal/mol, suggesting that F40F9.9 is a water channel (AQP-CE2). AQP-CE2 was not permeable to glycerol or urea. Oocyte P(f) was reversibly inhibited by 58% after an incubation with 0.3 mM HgCl(2). To identify the mercury-sensitive site, four individual cysteine residues in AQP-CE2 (at positions 47, 132, 149, 259) were altered to serine by site-directed mutagenesis. Of these mutants, only C132S had a P(f) similar to that of the wild-type together with an acquired mercury resistance, suggesting that Cys-132 is the mercury-sensitive site. Similar results were obtained by the mutation of Cys-132 to alanine (C132A). Replacement of Cys-132 with tryptophan decreased P(f) by 64%, but P(f) was still 2.5 times higher than that of the control. Cys-132 is located in the transmembrane helix 3, close to the transition to the extracellular loop C. These results suggest that the transmembrane helix 3, including Cys-132, might participate in the aqueous pore formation, or, alternatively, that Cys-132 might contribute to the construction of the AQP protein.
