We describe here the PCR amplification of a DNA fragment (mtp1) from Mycobacterium smegmatis using primers derived from consensus sequences of the ABC family of transporters. The fragment encodes amino acid sequences that exhibited significant homology with different ABC transporters. Amino acid sequence alignment of the full length gene with other transporters identified the ABC protein as the B-subunit of the phosphate specific transporter. Strikingly, a M. smegmatis colony which exhibited a high level of ciprofloxacin resistance showed mRNA level overexpression of mtp1. Thus this is the first report in any prokaryote indicating differential expression of an ABC transporter in a fluoroquinolone resistant colony.
