BACKGROUND: The treatment of nosocomial infections caused by Acinetobacter baumannii has been hindered by the easiness of this species to acquire antimicrobial resistance. AIM: To study surface hydrophobicity, the presence of capsule and antimicrobial susceptibility of nosocomial Acinetobacter spp strains. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Ninety four Acinetobacter spp strains isolated from a public hospital of Santiago, between July 1995 and April 1996, were studied. RESULTS: Compared to Acinetobacter genospecies 3 isolates, A baumannii isolates exhibited greater antimicrobial resistance, was uniformly susceptible to imipenem and highly resistant to other antimicrobials of clinical use. Most strains of biotypes 8 and 9 were hydrophilic and encapsulated, whereas those of infrequent biotypes and of Acinetobacter genospecies 3 were, with few exceptions, hydrophobic and not encapsulated. CONCLUSIONS: Capsule production might confer a greater virulence to Acinetobacter baumannii biotypes 8 and 9, and explain their higher prevalence in the studied hospital.
