Increased resistance of Neisseria gonorrhoeae to penicillin has been reported from many centres around the world since the introduction of antibiotic therapy in the 1940s. This study reports the temporal changes in gonococcal penicillin sensitivity over a 3-year period. All patients with a diagnosis of gonorrhoea in the city of Edinburgh, Scotland between 1990 and 1992 were included in the study. Penicillin sensitivity of isolates was analysed in relation to the sex and sexual orientation of the patient and the antibiotic therapy given. Four hundred and twenty-seven new patient episodes of infection occurred of which penicillin sensitivities were available in 426. Eleven episodes of PPNG infection occurred. Chromosomally mediated penicillin resistance did not increase over the study period. No differences were evident in the sensitivity of isolates from homosexual and heterosexual patients. Unlike many other areas the relative resistance of N. gonorrhoeae is not increasing in Edinburgh at present. This may relate to local antibiotic policies combined with intrinsic characteristics of N. gonorrhoeae itself. Unlike previous reports there did not appear to be any increased resistance to penicillin in isolates from gay men.
