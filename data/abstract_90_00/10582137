Docetaxel is one of the most active single agents for the treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer. Given the preclinical indications for synergy and the lack of cross-resistance with other active agents in this disease, clinical trials of docetaxel combinations have been undertaken. Phase I and II clinical trials of docetaxel in combination with cisplatin, carboplatin, gemcitabine, vinorelbine, or thoracic radiation for patients with non-small-cell lung cancer were reviewed. The endpoint for phase I trials was to define the phase II doses for the docetaxel combinations where overall response rates, median and one year survival were the endpoints. Five phase I-II studies of docetaxel and cisplatin have reported response rates ranging from 21% to 48%. Median survival times ranged from 8 to 13 months, and one-year survivals from 32% to 58%. Combining docetaxel with vinorelbine resulted in a 37% response rate and a median survival of 9.4 months. Docetaxel in combination with gemcitabine produced a response rate of 53%. The adverse events of these combinations were manageable. Responses have also been reported in studies of docetaxel administered with carboplatin or thoracic radiation therapy. Combinations of docetaxel with platinum, vinorelbine, gemcitabine, and radiation were active in non-small-cell lung cancer with acceptable adverse effects. Phase III trials are currently in progress to further define the role of docetaxel combinations in the first-line treatment of this disease.
