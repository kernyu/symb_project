A growth-limiting medium was used for further studies on growth phase-dependent shifts in susceptibility of Candida albicans to direct lethal miconazole action. Restricted nutrition did not affect development of susceptibility. Reestablishment of resistance toward stationary phase was not a physiological response to nutrient exhaustion. Resistance developed even at low population density if cells were in physiological transition to stationary phase with glucose available.
