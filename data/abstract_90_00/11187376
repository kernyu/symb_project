The incidence of tuberculosis (TB) has more than doubled in the Baltic States during the last decade and is now 10-15 times higher than in Sweden. It is also a serious problem in Russia. Strains resistant to one or several of the anti-tuberculous drugs are common as is multi-drug resistance (MDR), i.e. strains resistant to the two most effective drugs rifampicin and isoniazid. MDR-TB is very difficult to treat; the mortality rate is high. Initiatives have been taken in the Nordic countries in order to help to control and improve the situation by way of supportive measures.
