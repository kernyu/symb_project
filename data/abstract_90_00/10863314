As a result of preventive measures during pregnancy and improved antiretroviral combination treatment, the problem area of HIV infection in childhood has undergone a change in recent years. Thanks to intensive cooperation between obstetricians and pediatricians, mother-to-child transmission of HIV in Germany has been decreased to less than 2%. Improvements in the diagnosis of HIV infection in childhood, infected children have been identified very early, and started on antiretroviral treatment, and prophylactic measures initiated. In the case of life-long anti-HIV treatment beginning in childhood, the same problems as those seen in adults must be expected (development of resistance, adherence, adverse effects).
