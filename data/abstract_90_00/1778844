Samples from different types of domestic milk products including cheese, kishfa and gaymer were assessed for bacteriological quality over a 4-month period. A total of 400 samples were randomly selected across Mosul city and tested for faecal coliform counts, enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) and enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC). Faecal coliforms were present at levels greater than 10(2) cfu/g in 72.5% and less than 10(2) cfu/g in 27.5% of samples. Of the 430 E. coli strains isolated from the 400 samples of milk products, 138 were serotypes of EPEC. These were found in 81 (40.5%) samples of cheese, 35 (23.8%) of kishfa and 22 (29.7%) of gaymer. During this period, 26 strains of ETEC were also isolated, all of which demonstrated heat-labile or heat-stable toxins. The high proportion of strains of three groups of E. coli showing resistance to antibiotics is discussed in relation to widespread use of antibiotics and the possible public health implication.
