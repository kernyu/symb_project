All Candida albicans isolates in Norwegian microbiological laboratories in 1991 judged clinically important (except vaginal isolates) were collected. The isolates were tested for susceptibility to fluconazole with an agar dilution test and a commercially available agar diffusion test. A total of 212 strains (95%) were susceptible to fluconazole, and MICs for most of the strains (92%) were < or = 1.56 micrograms/ml. The agar diffusion test using a 15-micrograms tablet and a 48-h incubation period separated resistant from susceptible strains with a wide margin. The only exception was a strain for which the MIC was 6.25 micrograms/ml. The difference in zone size between the resistant and the susceptible populations of strains was 11 mm. Accordingly, it appears that the agar diffusion test is an appropriate method for detecting fluconazole resistance. The 12 fluconazole-resistant isolates originated from eight AIDS patients with oral or esophageal Candida infections. Seven of the patients had been given fluconazole for 1 month or more, often as self medication. Four had infections that were clinically resistant to fluconazole; one additional patient responded only when the dose was increased. All isolates recovered from these patients were analyzed by multilocus enzyme electrophoresis. The 12 C. albicans isolates belonged to five electrophoretic types, but three of four patients attending one hospital had isolates belonging to one electrophoretic type. One possible explanation for this finding could be that a nosocomial spread of resistant strains has occurred.
