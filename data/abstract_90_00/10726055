The treatment of chronic hepatitis C is aimed at eliminating viral replication in order to prevent further evolution towards cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Virological parameters include hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype, qualitative viraemia, quantitative viral load and the characteristics of HCV quasi-species heterogeneity. These parameters can be used to predict and monitor the response to therapy, in order to help clinicians to tailor treatment of chronic hepatitis C and to better understand the molecular mechanisms underlying HCV resistance to antiviral drugs. Current knowledge on these various issues is reviewed in the present article.
