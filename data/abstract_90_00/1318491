A marked level of cell-mediated immunity (CMI) to Salmonella typhimurium-infection in mice, as determined by acquired resistance, delayed-type hypersensitivity, interleukin-2 production and interferon-gamma production, was induced by immunization with porin or viable cells but not with killed cells of S. typhimurium LT2. When the up-regulation of immune system to each immunogen was studied by comparing increases of Ia-bearing macrophages, the immunization with porin or viable cells, but not killed cells, could stimulate the immune system for more than 14 days. Interleukin-1 (IL-1) production of macrophages to each immunogen was also examined; the result showed that immunization with porin or viable cells could induce a notable level of IL-1 production, while killed cells could not. However, when the abilities to induce these immune responses were compared between UV-killed and heat-killed cells, UV-killed cells were superior to heat-killed cells. These results suggested that the ineffectiveness of immunogen that lacked CMI-inducing ability might be ascribed to the denaturation of antigen and the insufficient inductions of Ia-bearing macrophages and IL-1 production.
