OBJECTIVE: In HIV-infected adults prolonged monotherapy with zidovudine may be associated with the appearance of HIV strains with decreased zidovudine sensitivity, owing to specific mutations in the reverse transcriptase (RT) gene, and this has been suggested to be a reason for reduced zidovudine efficacy. This study was undertaken to determine the appearance of mutation at codon 215 of the RT gene in proviral DNA from PBMCs in HIV-infected children. DESIGN: A prospective, open study. SETTING: A University Pediatric Department. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Nineteen HIV-infected symptomatic children were treated with zidovudine for a median of 24 months. Clinical and laboratory controls for HIV infection status were performed monthly. Mutant proviral sequences were evaluated at the start of therapy, every 3 months during the first 6 months of therapy, and every 6 months thereafter. Clinical outcome was defined as stable or deteriorating. RESULTS: No child had proviral sequences mutant at codon 215 before starting zidovudine. Ten of 13 children who had received zidovudine for more than 6 months developed mutant proviral sequences. All the children (10 of 10) with mutant proviral sequences had a deteriorating clinical condition, compared to none of those (0 of 9) without mutation at codon 215. CONCLUSION: The appearance of HIV-1 codon 215 mutation seems to be strongly associated with zidovudine therapy and with clinical progression of HIV disease in children.
