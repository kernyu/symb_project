The extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESbla) gene on R-plasmid harbored in E. coli C3773, a transconjugant of the clinical isolate of Ent. gergoviae 3773 from our hospital, was cloned and two fragments were subcloned into M13. The nucleotide sequences of two fragments were determined. The primary structure of this ESbla deduced from nucleotide sequence had only a Gly-->Ser change at position 234 in comparison with SHV-1, which was supposed to be responsible for extended-spectrum activity and resistance to 3rd generation cephalosporins. The result suggested that the ESbla appearing in our hospital was SHV-2.
