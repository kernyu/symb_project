A total number of 6840 blood cultures were taken from 1753 patients hospitalized in the Children's Memorial Health Institute since 07.1992 to 11.1995. Among 6840 blood samples 679 (10.2%) were culture positive and 745 microorganisms were detected; 83.5% Gram(+) bacteria, 9.1% Enterobacteriaceae rods, 1.6% nonfermenters, anaerobes - 3.1% and yeast 2.1%. Fifty two percent of all isolated strains were represented by CoNS. These bacteria were isolated mainly from children hospitalized in cardiology, cardiosurgery, neurosurgery, gastroenterology departments and dialysis unit. We found 68% methicillin resistant strains of CoNS. S. aureus was isolated from blood of children on parenteral nutrition, peritoneal fluid from patients on CAPD, and from blood of children with osteomyelitis/arthritis. Fourty percent of the S. aureus strains were methicillin resistant. Nonfermenters and Enterobacteriaceae rods were isolated predominantly from ICU and gastroenterology department. High percentage of these strains were multiresistant to various antibiotics: penicillins, I and II generations cephalosporins, aminoglycosides and others.
