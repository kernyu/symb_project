Beta-Lactamase-producing, aminoglycoside-resistant strains of Enterococcus faecalis have been isolated from different geographic areas and are endemic at our institution. We report the isolation of a beta-lactamase-producing, aminoglycoside-resistant strain of E. faecium. The beta-lactamase was plasmid mediated and transferable with high frequency into a plasmid-free E. faecalis recipient strain. MICs suggested that the E. faecium strain also contained intrinsic (chromosomal) resistance to penicillins.
