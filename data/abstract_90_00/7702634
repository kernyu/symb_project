A number of antiherpesviral 5-substituted derivatives of 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosyluracil (araU) were significantly resistant to phosphorolysis by rat liver extract (S-9), but were gradually deglycosylated in a 2% enterobacteria cell suspension. The relative order of the resistance conferred by the different C-5 substituents was: 5-propynyl > 5-(E)-2-bromovinyl > 5-(E)-2-chlorovinyl > 5-methyl > 5-iodo. The 2'-fluoro derivatives of araU were completely resistant to phosphorolysis by both liver extract and enterobacteria, whereas the corresponding ribofuranosyl and 2'-deoxyribofuranosyl nucleosides were easily phosphorolysed by S-9, and were immediately cleaved in a 1% enterobacteria cell suspension. These findings suggest that antiherpesviral 5-substituted araU analogues can be relatively stable in vivo, when injected intravenously, and that degradation of 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosyl-5-(E-2-bromovinyl)uracil (sorivudine) following oral administration is due primarily to the action of enterobacteria.
