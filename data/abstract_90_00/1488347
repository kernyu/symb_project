The clinical efficacy and safety of intravenously administered imipenem/cilastatin in the treatment of 45 patients with severe bacterial septicemia due to intra-abdominal abscesses, respiratory and urinary tract as well as skin, soft tissue and bone infections was studied in the prospective and open trial. The in vitro antimicrobial activity of imipenem has been assessed on the basis of 909 bacterial strains isolated from patients treated and non-treated with imipenem/cilastatin. Among them were 526 Gram-negative, 370 Gram-positive aerobic bacteria and 13 Gram-negative anaerobic bacteria (Bacteroides sp.). Pathogen susceptibility to imipenem was determined with a disc-diffusion technique using Merck, Sharp Dohme sensitive discs containing 10 mcg of imipenem. Highly sensitive to imipenem were 96.8% of Gram-negative 82.7% of Gram-positive aerobic bacteria and 100% of Bacteroides sp. All patients, in whom evident foci of infection e.g. intra-abdominal abscesses were discovered, were operated on. The dosage of imipenem/cilastatin ranged from 1.5 to 2.0 g/24 h. Clinical cure and bacteriological elimination was achieved in 39 (86.7%) of patients while 6 (13.3%) showed marked clinical improvement. Before and during therapy, aerobic and anaerobic cultures were taken from accessible sites. All specimens were worked up using conventional bacteriological techniques. Before during and after therapy, samples for hematology, biochemistry and urinanalysis were obtained. Adverse clinical effects were noted in 2 (4.4%) patients. One had nausea and vomiting which were probably related to rapid infusion and disappeared after increasing the administration time, and one had transient diarrhea. In conclusion, imipenem/cilastatin was a well tolerated and effective drug in the treatment of life-threatening surgical infections.
