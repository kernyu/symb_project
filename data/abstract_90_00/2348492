The ultrastructure of 5 griseofulvin-resistant fungi of favus was studied by image processing with microcomputer. It was found that the cell walls of the fungi consisted of 8 layers, and the inner layer containing cytoplasm was loose. It was also found that all structures within the cytoplasm possessed a 1-3 layers integral envelope with chromatins in the nucleus. These might be contributing factors in the development of resistance to griseofulvin. This multiple-layered, thick cell wall might act as a barrier responsible for the impermeability of the cell to griseofulvin.
