Chloroquine-phosphate was suspended in various lipophilic and hydrophilic suppository bases in an amount of 250 mg/2.0 g. The authors studied the solidity and the disintegration time of the suppositories as well as the in vitro drug liberation with a membrane diffusion method. The effect of the storage time and the storage circumstances on the stability of the suppositories was observed. Tropics-resistance studies were also carried out at a temperature of 45 degrees C and at a relative humidity content of 75%, thus these suppositories may be used for the treatment of malaria. The Witepsol H 15 base was found to be the best in all respect for use in countries with a continental climate. Finally a function relationship was found between the concentration of the pharmacon and the diffusion time with linear regression analysis.
