Antimicrobial activities of meropenem (MEPM), imipenem (IPM), panipenem (PAPM), ceftazidime (CAZ), cefozopran (CZOP), aztreonam (AZT), norfloxacin (NFLX) and tetracycline (TC) against clinically isolated Gram-negative bacilli [271 strains of Enterobacteriaceae and 242 strains non-fermentative Gram-negative bacteria (NFB)] were investigated. Among carbapenem antibiotics, MEPM showed the lowest MIC90, which activity was about four-hold higher than those of IPM and PAPM. The activity of IPM was equal or slightly superior to that of PAPM. Resistance to IPM (> 16 micrograms/ml) was observed in 3 strains of Enterobacteriaceae (1.1%) and 14 strains of NFB (5.8%). It is conceivable that these strains produce metallo-beta-lactamase. Referring to the correlation among MICs of MEPM, IPM and PAPM, 3 strains in 3 species of Enterobacteriaceae showed cross resistance to carbapenems; while 14 strains of NFB showed cross resistance to MEPM and IPM, 15 strains to MEPM and PAPM, and 29 strains to IPM and PAPM, and all of these strains were Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Fifteen of 29 strains of IPM-resistant and 77 of 92 strains of PAPM-resistant P. aeruginosa were susceptible to MEPM. Thirty-three strains (12%) of the Enterobacteriaceae were resistant to CAZ and AZT (> or = 32 micrograms/ml) and these were considered as ESBL-producing strains.
