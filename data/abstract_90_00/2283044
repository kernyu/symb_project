The erythromycin resistance plasmid pSM752 carrying the cloned streptokinase gene, skc, was introduced by protoplast transformation into Streptococcus equisimilis H46A from which skc was originally cloned. Cells transiently supporting the replication of pSM752 gave rise to an erythromycin-resistant clone designated H46SM which was plasmid free and produced streptokinase at levels approximately twice as high as the wild type. Southern hybridization of total cell DNA with an skc-containing probe provided evidence for the duplication of the skc gene in the H46SM chromosome. The results, which have some bearing on industrial streptokinase production, can be best explained by a single cross-over event between the chromosome and the plasmid in the region of shared homology leading to the integration of pSM752 in a Campbell-like manner.
