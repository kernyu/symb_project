Bacteria expressing R67-plasmid encoded dihydrofolate reductase (R67 DHFR) exhibit high-level resistance to the antibiotic trimethoprim. Native R67 DHFR is a 34,000 M(r) homotetramer which exists in equilibrium with an inactive dimeric form. The structure of native R67 DHFR has now been solved at 1.7 A resolution and is unrelated to that of chromosomal DHFR. Homotetrameric R67 DHFR has an unusual pore, 25 A in length, passing through the middle of the molecule. Two folate molecules bind asymmetrically within the pore indicating that the enzyme's active site consists of symmetry related binding surfaces from all four identical units.
