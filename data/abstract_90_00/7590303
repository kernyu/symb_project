A common approach to identify and clone biosynthetic gene from an antibiotic-producing streptomycete is to clone the resistance gene for the antibiotic of interest and then use that gene to clone DNA that is linked to it. As a first step toward cloning the genes responsible for the biosynthesis of thiostrepton (Th) in Streptomyces laurentii (Sl), the Th resistance-encoding gene (tsnR) was cloned as a 1.5-kb BamHI-PvuII fragment in Escherichia coli (Ec), and shown to confer Th resistance when introduced into S. lividans TK24. The tsnR-containing DNA fragment was used as a probe to isolate clones from cosmid libraries of DNA in the Ec cosmid vector SuperCos, and pOJ446 (an Ec/streptomycete) cosmid vector. Sequence and genetic analysis of the DNA flanking the tsnR indicates that the Sl tsnR is not closely linked to biosynthetic genes. Instead it is located within a cluster of ribosomal protein operons.
