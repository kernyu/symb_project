Urinary tract infections (UTIs) occur more commonly in the elderly than in younger adults. The frequency of concomitant chronic illness and decreased resistance in this age group confers increased rates of morbidity and mortality, and manifestations are often atypical. Diagnosis requires careful interpretation of urine culture results and a determination of the infection as asymptomatic bacteriuria, uncomplicated UTI, or complicated UTI. This, in turn, guides therapeutic measures, including the use of oral antibiotics.
