We carried out clinical and bacteriological studies on clavulanic acid/amoxicillin and amoxicillin in pediatric sinusitis at 11 general practice settings. The results are summarized as follows. 1. The major isolated organisms from content of middle meatus were Streptococcus pneumoniae 32.2%, Haemophilus influenzae 32.0% and Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis 25.1%. Similar results were observed for the major isolates from nasopharynx. 2. 62.1% of S. pneumoniae isolated were drug resistant S. pneumoniae (PISP, PRSP) and they were increasing year by year. 3. Drug resistant S. pneumoniae was isolated from 38.6% of all cases. 4. Regarding MIC90, CVA/AMPC showed superior antimicrobial activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis. 5. The clinical efficacy, bacteriological efficacy and utility of CVA/AMPC-treated group were 78%, 58% and 72.8%, respectively, and they were significantly superior to AMPC-treated group. 6. Adverse reactions were observed in 11.2% of CVA/AMPC group, involving diarrhea and stool loose and there was no statistical deference from those of AMPC group.
