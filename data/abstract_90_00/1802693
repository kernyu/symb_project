The purpose of the study was to determine whether vancomycin-resistant strains of Staphylococcus haemolyticus could be selected regardless of the initial MIC of vancomycin. Twenty-one bloodstream isolates of Staphylococcus haemolyticus were studied by broth and agar selection methods. The broth method selected strains for which MICs of vancomycin ranged from 4 to 32 micrograms/ml and MBCs from 16 to greater than 128 micrograms/ml. The agar method selected strains for which MICs ranged from 8 to 32 micrograms/ml and MBCs from 8 to greater than 128 micrograms/ml. For comparison, seven strains of Staphylococcus epidermidis were evaluated by the agar selection method. Final MICs of vancomycin ranged from 8 to 16 micrograms/ml; MBCs ranged from 16 to 64 micrograms/ml. Clearly, in vitro exposure to vancomycin can select strains of Staphylococcus haemolyticus and Staphylococcus epidermidis for which MIC values are beyond the susceptible breakpoint.
