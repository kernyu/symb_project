A case of severe electric burns complicated by multiple antibiotic resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa not responding to various antibiotics administered systemically is presented. Citric acid (3%) was used successfully to eliminate Pseudomonas aeruginosa from burn wounds and infection was completely controlled in 14 days. Citric acid treatment is evidently of value in the clinical control of burn wound colonization caused by difficult strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
