The naturally occurring plasmid pSTS7 from Staphylococcus epidermidis mediated resistance to tetracycline via a tetL gene and to kanamycin and neomycin via an aadD gene. Plasmid pSTS7 showed partial restriction map and sequence homology to the previously described tetracycline resistance plasmid pNS1981 from Bacillus subtilis and to the kanamycin/neomycin/bleomycin resistance plasmid pUB110 from S. aureus. Sequence analysis of the regions flanking the two resistance genes in pSTS7 led to the identification of a novel site for interplasmid recombination which could explain the derivation of pSTS7 from the incompatible pNS1981- and pUB110-like parental plasmids under tetracycline-selective pressure.
