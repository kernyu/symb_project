Using two strains of Salmonella enteritidis, one susceptible and one resistant to ampicillin, we studied the efficacies of ampicillin, gentamicin, ampicillin plus gentamicin, ofloxacin, and cefotaxime for the treatment of experimental salmonella endocarditis. Rabbits were treated for 3 days with dosages of antibiotic selected to achieve concentrations in serum equivalent to those obtained in humans during therapy. Aortic salmonella endocarditis seemed to be very difficult to treat, and all antimicrobial regimens failed to achieve the complete sterilization of cardiac vegetations. In vitro studies did not accurately predict the in vivo response to therapy, and no correlations regarding the synergistic activity of the combination of ampicillin plus gentamicin were observed. For the ampicillin-susceptible S. enteritidis isolate, ampicillin and cefotaxime produced the greatest reduction in the number of organisms in vegetations, with no significant differences between them. For the ampicillin-resistant strain, the combination of ampicillin with gentamicin produced a synergistic effect that was not anticipated by the in vitro studies. Both cefotaxime and ofloxacin were effective in reducing the number of microorganisms in the vegetations, although the reduction produced by cefotaxime was less that that produced against the ampicillin-susceptible strain. Monotherapy with gentamicin exhibited only modest activity against the ampicillin-susceptible S. enteritidis strain.
