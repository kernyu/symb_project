Four classes of drugs are reviewed: blood schizontocides acting only on the hemoglobin-digesting blood stages, the antifolates which attack tetrahydrofolate synthesis in all the growing stages, antimitochondrials affecting synthesis and electron transport, and 8-aminoquinolines which interfere with redox processes. Drug efflux via a multidrug resistance membrane protein, and the production of a protein competing with the drug for the target hemin are thought to be responsible for resistance to blood schizontocides. Structural changes in target enzymes are responsible for easily-developed resistance to antifolates and antimitochondrials. The judicious use of drug combinations can help to avoid development of resistance and combat resistant infections, but new drugs are urgently needed.
