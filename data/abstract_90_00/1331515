Three independently isolated mutants of human cytomegalovirus strain AD169 were found to be resistant to ganciclovir at a 50% effective dose of 200 microM. Phosphorylation of ganciclovir was reduced 10-fold in mutant-infected cells compared with AD169-infected cells. All three mutants were also determined to be resistant to the nucleotide analogs (S)-1-[(3-hydroxy-2- phosphonylmethoxy)propyl]adenine (HPMPA) and (S)-1-[(3-hydroxy-2-phosphonylmethoxy)propyl]cytosine (HPMPC) and hypersensitive to thymine-1-D-arabinofuranoside (AraT). Single base changes resulting in amino acid substitutions were demonstrated in the nucleotide sequence of the DNA polymerase gene of each mutant. The polymerase mutation contained in one of the mutants was transferred to the wild-type AD169 background. Ganciclovir phosphorylation in cells infected with the recombinant virus produced by this transfer was found to be equivalent to that of AD169-infected cells. The ganciclovir resistance of the recombinant was reduced fourfold compared with that of the parental mutant; however, the recombinant remained resistant to HPMPA and HPMPC and hypersensitive to AraT. The ganciclovir resistance of the mutants therefore appears to result from mutations in two genes: (i) a kinase which phosphorylates ganciclovir and (ii) the viral DNA polymerase.
