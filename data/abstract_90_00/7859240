Twenty-five patients with typhoid fever, who were resistant to amoxicillin and chloramphenicol, were successfully treated with ofloxacin. Ofloxacin was administered at a dosage of 200 mg three times daily for 7 to 10 days. In a few seriously ill patients, a dosage of 400 mg three times daily for 3 days, followed by 200 mg three times daily for 4 to 7 days, was administered. This study confirmed the presence of resistant strains of Salmonella typhi. These strains were resistant to the commonly used drugs, chloramphenicol and amoxicillin. Ofloxacin was found to be well tolerated and effective in treating typhoid fever.
