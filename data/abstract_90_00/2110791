The influence of recombinant bovine interferon gamma (rBoIFN-gamma) treatment on resistance of clinically normal and dexamethasone-treated calves to Haemophilus somnus infection was evaluated. Four groups of 6 calves each were treated with saline solution (controls), dexamethasone (0.04 mg/kg of body weight/for 3 days), rBoIFN-gamma (2 micrograms/kg for 2 days), or dexamethasone and rBoIFN-gamma (aforementioned dosages). All treatments were started 24 hours before intrabronchial challenge exposure with 5 x 10(9) colony-forming units of H somnus. Rectal temperature and WBC count were monitored daily. Two of the dexamethasone-treated calves died of pneumonia 4 days after challenge exposure and were necropsied. All other calves were euthanatized and necropsied 7 days after challenge exposure. All calves had pneumonia of variable intensity. Dexamethasone-treated calves had increased volume of pneumonic lung (P less than 0.05) and increased severity of pneumonia, compared with control calves. Recombinant bovine interferon gamma treatment resulted in reduction in pneumonic lung volume and severity of pneumonia in dexamethasone-treated calves (P less than 0.05), although it did not influence severity of pneumonia in nondexamethasone-treated calves.
