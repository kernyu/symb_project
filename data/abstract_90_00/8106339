The Escherichia coli strain known as GC2553, FB8, UTH1038, or K12S (Luria), considered an F- lambda- wild-type strain, is shown here to carry a cryptic mutation, ftsR1, causing nonlethal filamentation during exponential growth in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth at 42 degrees C and the inability to grow in salt-free LB broth at 42 degrees C. The ftsR1 mutation is completely suppressed in genetic backgrounds which increase RelA-dependent synthesis of the nucleotide ppGpp, i.e., argS201 (Mecr) and alaS21 (Mecr) mutations, affecting aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, or the presence of a plac-relA' plasmid. These backgrounds also confer resistance in LB broth to the beta-lactam mecillinam, an antibiotic which specifically inhibits penicillin-binding protein 2 and, in wild-type cells, causes an indirect block in cell division. Furthermore, the ftsR1 mutant (but not an isogenic ftsR+ strain) is sensitive to mecillinam in minimal glucose medium at 37 degrees C. Since the division block caused by mecillinam can be overcome by overproduction of the cell division protein FtsZ, we tested the effect of plasmid pZAQ (carrying the ftsZ, ftsA, and ftsQ genes) on the ftsR1 mutant; it suppressed the filamentation in LB broth and the mecillinam sensitivity on minimal glucose medium at 37 degrees C but not the growth defect in salt-free LB broth at 42 degrees C. Genetic analysis indicated that the full phenotype of the ftsR1 mutant is due to a single mutation in the rpoB gene (90 min), coding for the beta subunit of RNA polymerase; we call this allele rpoB369(Fts). We propose that the rpoB369(Fts) mutation alters the specificity of the polymerase and that the mutant enzyme can recover normal activity in the presence of high salt concentrations or via interaction with the nucleotide ppGpp.
