One of the resistance mechanisms to folate-based thymidylate synthase (TS) inhibitors is the increase in TS activity in tumor cells. Human B lymphoblastoid cell line (W1L2) was made resistant to a lipophilic non-polyglutamatable TS inhibitor (ZM249148), and the subline (W1L2:R179) showed a 20-fold increase in TS enzyme activity with concomitant overexpression of TS mRNA. To overcome the resistance, we designed a ribozyme that can cleave the CUC sequences in a triple tandemly repeated sequence of TS mRNA. Expression of this ribozyme in W1L2:R179 cells transfected with Epstein Barr virus-based expression vector resulted in sensitization to TS inhibitors concomitantly with a decrease of TS expression. The ribozyme expressed in transfectants was shown to be functional in cleaving artificial TS RNA in vitro.
