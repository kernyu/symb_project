Fluconazole is a new antifungal drug which is now very often used for the treatment of yeasts infections: mucocutaneous candidosis, systemic candidosis and cryptococcosis. Some resistance seems to occur in clinical practice. It turns out now that it must be necessary to test the drug susceptibility in vitro of the yeast strains isolated from patients. Unfortunately, a current laboratory technique to test this agent doesn't exist. In this work a useful method for Minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) evaluation in a commercial available broth medium, and a technique for testing fluconazole disks on an agar medium are studied. 150 strains of different yeasts species are tested. A regression curve is performed to correlate the two methods.
