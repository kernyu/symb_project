The same point mutation in the human cytomegalovirus UL97 open reading frame was found in three independently isolated ganciclovir-resistant mutants of strain AD169. Point mutations in the DNA polymerase genes of these strains have been previously identified (N.S. Lurain, K.D. Thompson, E.W. Holmes, and G.S. Read, J. Virol. 66:7146-7152, 1992). All three strains are, therefore, double mutants. To determine the contribution of the UL97 mutation to the high ganciclovir resistance of these mutants, the mutation from the ganciclovir-resistant strain D6/3/1 was transferred to the wild-type strain AD169 to produce the recombinant R6HS. The ganciclovir resistance of R6HS is 4-fold lower than that of D6/3/1 but 10-fold higher than that of AD169. R6HS, like AD169, is sensitive to the nucleotide analogs (S)-1-[(3-hydroxy-2-phosphonylmethoxy) propyl]adenine and (S)-1-[(3-hydroxy-2-phosphonylmethoxy)propyl]cytosine. Ganciclovir phosphorylation in R6HS-infected cells was at the same reduced level as that found in cells infected with the parental mutant D6/3/1. The same G-to-T transversion at nucleotide 1380 in the UL97 coding sequence is present in both R6HS and D6/3/1. This mutation results in the substitution of isoleucine for methionine at amino acid residue 460. In an alignment of the R6HS UL97 amino acid sequence with the amino acid sequences of a wide range of protein kinase family members, methionine 460 lies within a highly conserved region which may function in nucleotide binding and phosphate transfer.
