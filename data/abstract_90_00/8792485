A total of 134 cases of salmonella infections have been noted during the past 10 years in our hospital. Cases of non-typhoidal salmonellosis increased gradually but infections due to Salmonella typhi did not show the same trend. Gastroenteritis was the most prevalent diagnosis in patients below 1 year of age and non-typhoidal bacteraemia and localized infections were the most prevalent in patients over 50 years. Diabetes mellitus was an important underlying disease especially in patients with localized infections (86%). Travelling history played an important role in cases of enteric fever. The susceptibility pattern in non-typhoidal salmonella changed markedly over the study period; multiple drug resistance was noted. The susceptibility pattern of S. typhi showed no significant change. Seven deaths due to salmonella infections were noted (5.2%); all due to non-typhoidal salmonellosis, especially serogroup B. Age above 50 years, localized infection, infection with serogroup B and diabetes were poor prognostic factors.
