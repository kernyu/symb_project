The influence of the glutathione precursor, l-2-oxothiazolidine-4-carboxylic acid (OTZ), on the function of human peritoneal mesothelial cells in vitro, in conditions that mimic the in vivo effect of peritoneal dialysis solutions on mesothelium, was studied. Mesothelial monolayers were exposed to dialysis fluids (Dianeal 1.36 or Dianeal 3.86; Baxter Healthcare Corp, Round Lake, IL) that were diluted gradually with pooled-effluent dialysate obtained from patients undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis. In vitro exposure of mesothelium to standard dialysis fluid enhances their susceptibility to injury by hydrogen peroxide. OTZ added to dialysis solution in concentrations of 1 mmol/L prevented the toxic effect of hydrogen peroxide, probably by increasing intracellular glutathione. Mesothelial cells exposed to dialysis fluid become activated, evidenced by increased release of interleukin-6 and hyaluronan. OTZ used in concentrations of 1 mmol/L reduced that effect. Furthermore, the addition of glucose to the culture medium in a concentration of 45 mmol/L inhibits the proliferation of mesothelial cells; the presence of OTZ, 1 mmol/L, partially prevents the inhibitory effect of glucose. The results presented in this report show that by augmenting the intracellular concentration of glutathione in mesothelial cells by the addition of OTZ to the dialysis fluid, we can increase their resistance to the acute toxicity of free radicals and long-term toxicity of glucose. In addition, mesothelial cells with an increased glutathione level are less activated after their exposure to dialysis fluid.
