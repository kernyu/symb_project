76 Str.pneumoniae strains isolated from different clinical disease forms were studied for the sensitivity to antimicrobial drugs using the diffusimetric method and the dilution in agar method (MIC to penicillin). The results revealed that 44.74% of pneumococci were sensitive to penicillin, the remaining pneumococci being resistant; 18.42% showed a high resistance (MIC > or = 2 micrograms/ml). A close relationship was seen between sensitivity to penicillin on the one hand and the Pneumococcus origin and serotype on the other. As concerning the multiresistance to antimicrobial drugs, 47.4% of the strains presented resistance to > or = antibiotics belonging to different classes, the most frequent resistance pattern being P, E, Te, SxT. The most active antimicrobial drugs were vancomycin, amoxiclave, rifampicin, followed by ceftriaxone and amoxicillin.
