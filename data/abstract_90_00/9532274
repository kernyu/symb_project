A method was developed to load the surface of a central venous catheter with silver to prevent bacterial colonization. Silver confers a broad antimicrobial activity with a relatively low risk of resistance. Catheters were incubated with a silver nitrate solution in different concentrations. The solvent, incubation temperature and incubation period were varied to examine the influence on the catheter loading. With increasing incubation temperature, time and concentration of silver nitrate, higher rates of silver elution were observed by atomic absorption spectroscopy. Furthermore, by using ethanol-water as a solvent instead of pure water, the amount of silver bound to the catheter surface was enhanced. The release of silver from the catheter surface is mainly controlled by first order kinetics. Antimicrobial efficacy of the modified catheter, in comparison to unloaded catheters, was tested in a stationary and a dynamic model with different microorganisms. Adherence experiments with Candida albicans showed almost complete inhibition of growth during a period of 72 hours, including initial adherence. While initial adherence of bacteria could not be prevented, these experiments showed an excellent reduction of bacterial colonization. In a perfusion model, adhesion of E. coli could be reduced for at least seven days. Further studies are planned to examine prolonged antimicrobial effects.
