Recombinant interleukin-4 (IL-4) profoundly inhibits the proliferative response of chronic lymphocytic leukemic B cells (B-CLLs) to recombinant interleukin-2 (IL-2). In the present study, we confirmed and extended these data by showing that IL-4 strongly suppresses the [3H]thymidine incorporation by B-CLLs stimulated by recombinant tumor necrosis factor alpha, recombinant interferon alpha, IL-2, and low molecular weight B cell growth factor in the absence of costimulant. Recombinant interleukin-4 inhibits spontaneous DNA synthesis suggesting that it also interferes with the autocrine proliferation of these cells. Kinetic studies indicate that IL-4 suppresses rather than shifts the peak of cytokine-induced DNA synthesis. Moreover, IL-4 blocks the progression of B-CLLs in or into G1 stage of the cell cycle as shown by the inhibition of cytokine-induced [3H]uridine incorporation. Finally, IL-4 pretreatment of B-CLLs prevents their subsequent proliferative response to the above cytokines, indicating that IL-4 confers to the B-CLLs a state of resistance to numerous stimulatory cytokines. The antiproliferative effects of IL-4 suggest that this lymphokine may have important therapeutic implications for the B-CLL patients.
