A new gene, dhfrIX, coding for a trimethoprim-resistant dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), was found in porcine isolates of Escherichia coli. The new enzyme, DHFR IX, containing 178 amino acids, showed an amino acid similarity of about 26% with DHFR I and the chromosomal DHFR of E. coli K-12. The dhfrIX gene was observed to occur on two distinctly different transferable plasmids, although a fragment of about 2.9 kb, including dhfrIX, had an identical restriction enzyme digestion map in each case. The new plasmid-borne dhfrIX gene mediates resistance to a drug level of only about 250 micrograms/ml, as compared with more than 1,000 micrograms/ml for the more frequently encountered dhfrI gene. The new plasmid-borne trimethoprim resistance gene could have been selected and spread as a consequence of the extensive use of trimethoprim in veterinary practice in Sweden. It will be important to try to follow its possible occurrence in human pathogens as well.
