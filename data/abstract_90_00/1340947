One hundred thirty two strains of acinetobacter isolated between october 1989 and march 1991 at the San Juan de Dios Hospital, Santiago de Chile were included in this study. One hundred twelve isolates were obtained from patients and 20 from the hospital environment. Among the 112 clinical isolates, 108 (96.4%) were identified according to the new classification proposed by Bouvet and Grimont in 1986 as A. baumannii, and four as acinetobacter genospecies 3. The 20 strains obtained from the hospital environment corresponded to A baumannii. No differences in the activities of the antimicrobial agents were found between clinical and environmental strains of A baumannii. Imipenem was the most active antimicrobial drug against A baumannii followed in descending order by sulbactam ampicillin and ceftazidime. The other antimicrobials tested showed poor activity against these strains as revealed for the MICs 50 and 90 in the resistance range.
