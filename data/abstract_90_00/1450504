A 76-year-old man who was admitted to the hospital because of chronic renal insufficiency and chronic hepatitis died of Corynebacterium group JK pneumonia, after showing a slight improvement by treatment of Staphylococcus aureus with sulbactam/cefoperazone and minocycline. Transtracheal aspiration (TTA) just before his death revealed numerous gram-positive bacilli phagocytized by many neutrophils and more than 10(8) colony forming units (CFU)/ml of Corynebacterium group JK. A drug susceptibility test showed Corynebacterium group JK was resistant to many antibiotics, with the exception of vancomycin and amikacin.
