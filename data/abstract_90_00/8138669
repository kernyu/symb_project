We treated 125 patients with strongyloidiasis (78 males and 47 females) by 2 oral doses of ivermectin (6 mg) at 2-week interval, and obtained the following results: 1. Eradication rate after treatment was 86.4% (108 of 125 patients), responsively. Out of the total 17 patients were resistant (non-responsive) to treatment, 8 patients received a further course of ivermectin and all Strongyloides stercoralis in their feces were eradicated. 2. Side effects were observed in 7.2% of the patients after the first dose treatment and in 3.2% after the second dose. But all symptoms were mild and self-limited. Although liver disfunction developed in 13.6% of the patients, no symptoms occurred and no special treatment was required. 3. Positive rate of anti-HTLV-I antibody in the resistant group was significantly higher (80.0%) than in the eradicated group (29.2%) and in the stool-negative group (0%). 4. Although eosinophils before treatment in the eradicated group was significantly higher than that of controls, there was no significant difference between the resistant group and controls. IgE levels in the resistant group was significantly lower than in the eradicated group. We would like to conclude that IVM is the best drug for treatment of the patient with Strongyloides stercoralis not only from this results but also our previous reports which had investigated the clinical efficacy on thiabendazole, mebendazole and albendazole.
