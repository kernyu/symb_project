Trimetrexate represents one of a number of new antimetabolites that have been studied in malignant, rheumatological and infectious disease. Methotrexate, the classical antifolate agent, is active in a broad spectrum of clinical settings, but its use is limited ny pre-existing or acquired cellular resistance. Trimetrexate is an agent that does not require uptake by the folate carrier transport system, a major mechanism of cellular resistance both in vitro and in vivo. Both dihydrofolate reductase inhibition and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) assays can be used to determine drug concentrations. Clearance of trimetrexate has been reported to follow biphasic or triphasic patterns. Elimination is primarily by biotransformation with less than 5% of the drug excreted renally in an unchanged form. Both active and inactive metabolites have been found, but the precise metabolic pathways have yet to be defined. The role of trimetrexate in the treatment of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia is limited to compassionate use, as clinical studies have shown cotrimoxazole (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole) to be superior to trimetrexate. However, in a wide spectrum of malignant processes, trimetrexate appears to have a role either as a high-dose single agent, with calcium folinate (leucovorin calcium) rescue, or in combination with other antineoplastic agents. However, further trials are needed to fully establish the efficacy of trimetrexate in these settings. Increased knowledge of the pattern of resistance for individual tumours and tumour types may result in trimetrexate becoming more widely used clinically.
