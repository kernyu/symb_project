Coartemether is a fixed 1:6 ratio of artemether and lumefantrine (benflumetol), a joint development between Novartis Pharma and the Academy of Military Medical Sciences (Beijing, China). It is well tolerated and has a high efficacy against uncomplicated and drug resistant falciparum malaria by oral administration. The preclinical profile of coartemether revealed no prohibitive toxicological, teratogenic or mutagenic findings. No evidence of neurotoxicity was seen in oral preclinical studies. It shows a negative response to the induction of resistance and prevents recrudescence. Clinically, coartemether shows a rapid onset of antiparasitic action, resolution of symptoms, no clinical neurotoxicity and excellent parasite clearance.
