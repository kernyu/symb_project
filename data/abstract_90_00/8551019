Twenty-two isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, recovered from patients over a period of about one year, exhibited low level resistance to mupirocin, developed a salmon pink colour on culture and 21 had the same phage-type. However the plasmid profiles and associated antibiotic resistances differed. Digestion of cellular DNA with SmaI showed that two isolates from a single patient had a markedly different pattern to the remainder, and that six others differed by one band, though these formed groups of one and five isolates. This episode apparently represents a small outbreak of colonization or infection, which would have been missed but for the unusual pigmentation of the isolates recovered, and illustrates the difficulties of relying on a single typing system.
