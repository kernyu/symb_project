The objective of prophylactic antibiotherapy is to reduce the frequency and complications of post operatory infections. The pharmacokinetic and microbiologic profiles of antibiotics are well codified. They must: to have a bacterial activity on frequently encountered germs and those susceptible to develop; not to create resistance nor serious side effects; to have a good tissular diffusion. Moreover, their cost must be economically acceptable. When indicated principally in clean, clean contaminated and contaminated surgery, prophylactic antibiotherapy must be of short duration, not exceeding 24 to 48 hours, habitually in monotherapy; the validity and efficiency concepts are hence no more contested; prophylactic antibiotherapy has neatly reduced the consumption and an important hospital budget wastage in antibiotics on one side, and the duration and cost of hospitalisation on the other side.
