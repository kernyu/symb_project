Mechanisms and transferability of beta-lactam resistance in 50 ceftazidime resistant strains of Enterobacteriaceae was studied. These strains were selected from 1991 E. coli, 1035 Enterobacter spp., 168 Citrobacter spp. and 1371 Klebsiella spp., isolated from patients hospitalized in ICUs and in the pediatric and urology departments of six hospitals in Bratislava during the years 1994-1996. The selected strains expressed the resistance not only to ceftazidime (50/50) but also to ampicillin (50/50), ceftriaxone (50/50), cefotaxime (49/50) and cefoxitin (45/50). The mechanism of resistance in all 50 strains was the production of beta-lactamases by conjugation, using either ceftazidime or cefotaxime for the selection of transconjugants and by isolation of R-plasmids ranging from to 55-87 kb from donor strains and from transconjugants. A total of 21 isolates possessed chromosomally encoded resistance and 25 clinical isolates and their transconjugants expressed ESBL sensitive to clavulanate. Selected E. coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates expressed the presence of TEM and SHV enzymes determined by isoelectric focusing. The possible trends in the development of antimicrobial resistance in Slovakia in the future are indicated.
