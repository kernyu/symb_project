We studied the microbiological characteristics of Enterococcus faecium SF 68 (an oral vaccine) assessing post-antibiotic effect of ampicillin and growth curves in different media. Results showed a good resistance of the microorganism tested which has important implications in clinical practice. The growth ability of Enterococcus faecium SF 68 was similar on all media tested.
