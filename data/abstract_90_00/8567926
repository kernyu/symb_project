A nonisotopic hybridization assay for human immunodeficiency virus genotypic zidovudine resistance determination is described. Biotinylated PCR product was hybridized with enzyme-labeled probes for wild-type or resistant mutant sequences and detected colorimetrically or chemiluminescently in a microplate format. Changes in mutant-to-wild-type ratios allow for the monitoring of longitudinal patient samples.
