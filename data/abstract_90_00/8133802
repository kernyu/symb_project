Vibrio cholerae O139 (synonym Bengal), a novel serovar of V. cholerae, is the causative agent of large outbreaks of cholera-like illness currently sweeping India and Bangladesh. Eight randomly selected V. cholerae O139 isolates were studied for their biological properties, which were compared with those of V. cholerae O1 and other V. cholerae non-O1. The V. cholerae O139 isolates were characterized by the production of large amount of cholera toxin, hemagglutination, weak hemolytic properties, resistance to polymyxin B, lysogeny with, and production of, kappa type phage (4/8 isolates only), and resistance to both classical and El Tor-specific phages. Thus, V. cholerae O139 isolates had an overall similarity with V. cholerae O1 El Tor.
