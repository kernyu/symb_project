Variants of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 that display 500- to 1,000-fold resistance to the (-) enantiomer of 2'-deoxy-3'-thiacytidine and approximately 4- to 8-fold resistance to 2',3'-dideoxycytidine and 2',3'-dideoxyinosine have been generated through in vitro selection with the former compound. The polymerase regions of several of these resistant viruses shared a codon alteration at site 184 (ATG-->GTG; methionine-->valine), a mutation previously associated with low-level resistance to 2',3'-dideoxycytidine. The biological relevance of this mutation for the (-) enantiomer of 2'-deoxy-3'-thiacytidine was confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis with the HXB2-D clone of human immunodeficiency virus type 1.
