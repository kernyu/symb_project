Antibiotic susceptibility of 898 Staphylococcus strains isolated in 9 medical centres of Moscow and St. Petersburg was tested. The frequency of methicillin resistant staphylococci (MRS) ranged from 0 to 40 per cent for Staphylococcus aureus and from 0 to 65.9 per cent for coagulase negative staphylococci (CNS). The highest frequencies of MRS were in hematologic, oncologic and traumatologic units as well as in intensive care units for newborns. The frequencies of MRS in St. Petersburg were much lower than those in Moscow. Among the methicillin susceptible staphylococci the frequency of the isolates that produced beta-lactamases amounted to 81 per cent for S. aureus and to 60 per cent for CNS. Practically 100 per cent of the isolates was susceptible to ampicillin/sulbactam and cephalosporins of the 1st, 2nd and 3rd generations. 86-99 per cent of the isolates was susceptible to erythromycin, clindamycin, tetracycline, gentamicin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxasole. All the MRS isolates were susceptible to vancomycin. 95, 84 and 70 per cent of the S.aureus strains were susceptible to fusidin, rifampicin and ciprofloxacin, respectively. The susceptibility of the CNS isolates was somewhat lower.
