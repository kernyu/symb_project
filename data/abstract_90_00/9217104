The kinetics of inhibition of Listeria innocua strain Lin11 in a nutrient broth containing either nisin, pediocin AcH, or enterococcin EFS2 at concentrations ensuring a 2-3 log reduction of the population were first investigated. The rate of inhibition differed considerably between the bacteriocins. At the time that maximum viability loss occurred in the cultures containing either nisin (12 AU ml(-1)) or pediocin AcH (50 AU ml(-1)) the survivors resumed growth, although the medium retained most of its initial inhibitory activity. The survivors displayed increased resistance not only toward the bacteriocin they were in contact with, but toward the two other bacteriocins under study.
