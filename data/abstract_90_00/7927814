Escherichia coli strains (n = 678 and n = 670) isolated from faecal samples from 90 and 93 healthy volunteers of two cities, Weert and Roermond respectively, were analysed for their susceptibility to 12 antimicrobial agents during a 15-week period. Significant differences between both cities in the distribution of the MIC values were observed for apramycin, chloramphenicol, kanamycin, neomycin, nitrofurantoin, sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim. For Weert (n = 678) the antibiotic resistance percentages varied from 0.4% for nalidixic acid to 26.7% for sulfamethoxazole. For Roermond (n = 670) the figures varied from 0.6% for nitrofurantoin to 37.5% for sulfamethoxazole. Resistance to amoxicillin/clavulanate was not found in either city. The most frequent pattern was resistance to sulfamethoxazole only, followed by resistance to oxytetracycline, streptomycin and sulfamethoxazole. In each individual there was only a small variation in resistance patterns of the isolates, i.e. the majority had one (n = 51) or two (n = 63) patterns with a maximum of five during the 15-week period. A fully susceptible pattern was found in the strains from 38 individuals.
