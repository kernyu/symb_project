Endothelial cells are attractive targets for gene transfer because of their immediate contact with the bloodstream, and, therefore, they might serve as vehicles for therapeutic drug delivery. Recently, we and others reported that endothelial cells of animal origin efficiently express both secretory and nonsecretory recombinant proteins. We now show that human endothelial cells are also capable of expressing a recombinant gene following transduction with retroviral vectors. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells were transduced with either the N2 or the SAX vector. Following selection with G418, cells transduced by both vectors were found to express neophosphotransferase activity, the product of the neomycin resistance gene. The fact that a recombinant gene can be readily inserted and efficiently expressed into human endothelial cells suggests that these cells may be able to serve a role in human gene therapy.
