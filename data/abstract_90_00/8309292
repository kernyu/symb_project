The authors have compared the susceptibility of bacterial strains isolated from clinical material in 1990 and 1991 to the most frequently used cephalosporins: cefuroxime, ceftazidime and cefotaxime. The highest susceptibility in 1990 was to cefotaxime, which was seldom used at that time, unlike cefuroxime and ceftazidime. In 1991 an increase in the number of strains resistant to cefotaxime was found, in parallel with a further rise in resistance to cefuroxime and ceftazidime. Frequent use of an antibiotic in a certain region favours the development of resistance. This observation calls for rational therapy with antibiotics, supported by regular studies of susceptibility of the strains in the region.
