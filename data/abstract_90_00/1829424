In a search for Schizosaccharomyces pombe mutants resistant to the antifungal agent papulacandin B, a morphological mutant was isolated. The mutant is round shaped in contrast to the rod shaped parental strain. This morphological defect segregated as a recessive Mendelian character and was not observed in other papulacandin B resistant mutants belonging to the same complementation group. The mutation mapped in the right arm of S. pombe chromosome III very close to pap1 marker. Mutant cell walls were more susceptible to alkali extraction and Novozyme degradation than those from the wild-type. A specific reduction in the cell wall galactomannan fraction was the only significant difference detected as compared to the wild-type strain. Levels of beta (1,3)-glucan and mannan synthases as well as other enzymic periplasmic mannoproteins were very similar in wild type and mutant strains.
