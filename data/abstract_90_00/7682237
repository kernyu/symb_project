Ligation of the T cell membrane Ag CD28 with mAb 9.3 or with its natural ligand B7/BB1 on accessory cells has been shown to provide a helper signal for stimulation through the TCR/CD3 complex. The present study was undertaken to investigate whether CD28 could function as an accessory signal receptor in the generation and effector phase of CTL activity. Purified resting human T cells were activated for 3 to 4 days with immobilized anti-CD3 mAb as the primary stimulus, and CTL activity was then measured by an anti-CD3-redirected 4-hr 51Cr release assay on Fc gamma R-bearing P815 target cells. When the concentration of immobilized anti-CD3 mAb as the primary signal for CTL generation was below threshold, CTL activity could be generated by addition of mAb 9.3 to the cultures. At optimal concentrations of immobilized anti-CD3, the addition of anti-CD28 did not further enhance the generation of CTL activity, but under these conditions generation of CTL activity was almost completely resistant to cyclosporin A (CsA) as a result of CsA-resistant IL-2 production. When 3T6 mouse fibroblasts, transfected with Fc gamma RII and B7, were used as accessory cells, anti-CD3 and B7 were also found to generate cytotoxic activity. Cytotoxic T cell generation under these conditions could be blocked by anti-B7 mAb, but was totally resistant to CsA. CTL activity could be generated by CD3 and CD28 ligation in both CD4(+) and CD8(+) subpopulations. Finally, we found that the activity of CTL lines (isolated from ascitic fluid of a patient with ovarian carcinoma and cultured in IL-2) was higher on B7-transfected targets than on the B7(-) targets. We conclude that CD28 ligation provides a major accessory signal for the CsA-resistant generation of CTL activity and that CD28-B7 interaction also enhances cytotoxic effector functions of CTL. These findings might have important implications for immunotherapeutic interventions.
