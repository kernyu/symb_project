Encapsulated Klebsiella pneumoniae strains frequently induce fatal nosocomial pneumonia. Cefodizime (CEF) as an antibiotic is suspected to enhance host resistance against various microbial invasions through interactions with bacteria and host cells. To investigate the influence of CEF on the pulmonary response to Klebsiella that does not merely result from direct bacterial clearance by the drug, we inoculated mice with heat-killed fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled K. pneumoniae. CEF upregulated (P < 0.01) the early Klebsiella-induced secretion of tumor necrosis factor alpha, as well as the number (P < 0.01) and phagocytic efficacy (P < 0.001) of alveolar macrophages. By contrast, the late polymorphonuclear neutrophil recruitment (P < 0.05) and levels of interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1alpha) (P < 0.05) and IL-6 (P < 0.05) were reduced. The stimulation of an early immune response by CEF followed by late reduction in inflammation may be beneficial against bacterial pneumonia.
