The genetic basis of macrolide resistance was characterized in 59 Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates. All isolates were collected in 1995 and 1997 and were from invasive infections. The majority of the isolates (54 of 59 isolates) were erythromycin and clindamycin resistant (MLS(B)-phenotype) and carried the ermAM gene. Five isolates were erythromycin resistant but clindamycin susceptible (M-phenotype). Using PCR the mefE gene was detected in these five isolates. Contrary to the situation found in Canada and the USA, mefE-mediated erythromycin resistance in S. pneumoniae is uncommon in Belgium.
