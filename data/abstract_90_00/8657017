To examine the efficacy of sisomicin (SISO) incorporated into fibrin glue (FG) for the prevention of graft infection in animal models, the susceptibility to infection of Dacron grafts (control) and SISO-FG Dacron grafts following the inoculation of Staphylococcus aureus or S. epidermidis was compared. The results showed that SISO-FG Dacron grafts displayed resistance to graft infection.
