This study concern the distribution and sensibility towards some antibiotics of 318 Staphylococcus aureus strains isolated in bacteriological samples coming from la Rabta hospital units. The study of distribution shows that 75% of these strains are isolated in bacteriological samples coming from surgery and intensive care unit dermatology unit, and ear nose and throat unit. The bacteriological samples are matter, blood, and intensive care materials. The study of sensibility found a high frequency of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus. These strains are also resistant towards macrolide and lincosamide. MLSB resistance is the predominant phenotypic aspect. It was also observed that all of Staphylococcus aureus gentamicin resistant strains were also resistant toward methicillin. At last is seems that pritinamicin, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, and ofloxacin, are good alternatives for treatment of staphylococcus aureus infections diseases.
