A trial has been conducted of recombinant alpha 2-interferon (reaferon) used in 32 patients with Ph'[correction of Rh']-positive chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). A chronic stage was in 3, transient in 3 and blast in 1 patients. 25 CML patients were newly diagnosed. The treatment lasted from 2 months to 3 years. Clinicohematological remission was confirmed conventionally and by the degree of Ph'-positive clone reduction. An attempt is made to clarify the mechanism underlying the resistance to reaferon basing on the immunological data (detection of antireaferon neutralizing antibodies). The authors propose a combined treatment (myelosan plus reaferon) of CML which has obvious advantages over myelosan monotherapy.
