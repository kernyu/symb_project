The accepted model for the penetration of beta-lactam antibiotics into gram-negative bacteria is that proposed by Zimmermann and Rosselet (Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 12:368-372, 1977). The model assumes (i) that diffusion of the antibiotic molecules across the outer membrane obeys Fick's law and can be characterized by a permeability constant for any given combination of organism and drug, (ii) that drug hydrolysis within the periplasm obeys Michaelis-Menten kinetics, and (iii) that a steady state is rapidly attained between drug uptake and hydrolysis. The model has allowed accurate prediction of antibiotic MICs for Escherichia coli strains from a knowledge of their beta-lactamase production and permeability characteristics. It has been suggested that the model is inappropriate for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but attempts to confirm this have been bedevilled by experimental difficulties in estimating permeability coefficients for this species. In the present study, we tested a prediction of the model that the overall resistance of P. aeruginosa transconjugants containing a plasmid-encoded beta-lactamase should continue to depend partly on permeability. Transconjugants with PSE-4 beta-lactamase were constructed in host strains with widely different levels of intrinsic, presumably impermeability-determined resistance. Contrary to the prediction of the model, all the transconjugants developed identical overall levels of resistance to substrate beta-lactams, such as azlocillin and cefoperazone, irrespective of the initial levels of intrinsic resistance of the recipient strains. We conclude that the model is inappropriate for P. aeruginosa, and possible explanations for the organism's behavior are discussed.
