The fungal wheat pathogen Mycosphaerella graminicola was transformed to carbendazim and hygromycin B resistance. A beta-tubulin gene from a M. graminicola strain resistant to the fungicide carbendazim was cloned and used to transform a sensitive strain to carbendazim resistance. Hygromycin B-resistant transformants (up to 8 per microgram of transforming DNA) arose at a higher rate than beta-tubulin transformants (up to 0.6 per microgram of DNA). Transformants were able to infect wheat and were morphologically similar to recipient strains.
