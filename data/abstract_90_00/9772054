OBJECTIVES: Rabeprazole is a new fast acting proton pump inhibitor that has recently been proven to be effective in the treatment of peptic ulceration and reflux esophagitis. The aim of this study was to evaluate rabeprazole in combination with antibiotics for the eradication of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) in patients with chronic active gastritis with or without peptic ulcer disease. METHODS: Seventy-five H. pylori-infected patients were randomized in a double-blind fashion to receive a 7-day treatment regimen consisting of: RAC, RAM, RCM, or RC (R=rabeprazole 20 mg b.d., A=amoxycillin 1 g b.d., C=clarithromycin 500 mg b.d., M=metronidazole 400 mg b.d.). Randomized patients were H. pylori-positive by gastric biopsy urease test, histology and 13C urea breath test (13C-UBT). H. pylori eradication was assessed by 13C-UBT, 4 and 8 wk after finishing treatment. Endoscopy with histology and culture for antibiotic sensitivity testing was performed pretreatment and if treatment failed. RESULTS: On an intention-to-treat analysis, treatment success was: RCM 100%, RAC 95%, RAM 90%, and RC 63%. The most common side effects were loose stools, headache, and taste disturbance, but there were no serious adverse events related to the study medication. The two patients failing RAM treatment had metronidazole-resistant strains before and after treatment. None of the pretreatment H. pylori isolates from six patients failing RC were clarithromycin resistant, but three of five successfully cultured posttreatment had developed clarithromycin resistance. CONCLUSION: Rabeprazole-based triple therapy with two antibiotics for 1 wk is safe and effective in eradicating H. pylori. Dual therapy with clarithromycin is less successful, and the majority of treatment failures develop clarithromycin resistance.
