Among 698 Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates, 475 were penicillin susceptible and > 99% of those were susceptible to 0.5 microgram of cefixime per ml; other pneumococci were tentatively assumed to be resistant to cefixime. A 1-microgram oxacillin disk was more reliable than a 5-micrograms cefixime disk for predicting susceptibility to cefixime.
