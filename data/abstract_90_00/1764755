The authors report the results of a valuation of paludometric indices during mai 1990 in Democratic Sao Tome e Principe Republic (RDSTP). These investigations (parasitic index and spleen index) suggest that malaria is mesoendemic in these area. Plasmodium susceptibility to chloroquine at posology of 25 mg/kg per os was evaluated (WHO standard 7 days field test). Among 58 children, ranging from 5 to 11 years old, resistance at level R I was observed in 9% of cases, at level R II in 14%. Among 10 strains of P. falciparum, 9 were chloroquine resistant in vitro. 2 strains were also less sensible to quinine.
