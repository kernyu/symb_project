The objective of this study was to evaluate the in vitro activity of sparfloxacin, levofloxacin, ofloxacin, and ciprofloxacin against contemporary strains of streptococci. Susceptibility testing of a panel of 300 recent clinical isolates of streptococci (100 each of beta-hemolytic, viridans group, and Streptococcus pneumoniae) using reference broth microdilution methods was performed, and the results were compared. Sparfloxacin was the most active of the four tested fluoroquinolones, inhibiting 99-100% of all isolates at concentrations of < or = 1 microgram/ml, and was two- to eightfold more potent than the three comparative agents. Levofloxacin was also quite active, inhibiting 98-100% of the isolates at concentrations < or = 2 micrograms/ml. Both sparfloxacin and levofloxacin possess an improved spectrum and potency against contemporary strains of streptococci compared to currently available fluoroquinolones.
