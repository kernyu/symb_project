Tn5096 was constructed by inserting an apramycin resistance gene, aac(3)IV, into IS493 from Streptomyces lividans. By using conventional and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, Tn5096 and related transposons were shown to insert into many different locations in the Streptomyces griseofuscus chromosome and in two linear plasmids. On insertion into the target site CANTg, 3 bp appeared to be duplicated. Independent transpositions were obtained by delivery of the transposon from a temperature-sensitive plasmid. The frequency of auxotrophy among cultures containing transpositions was about 0.2%.
