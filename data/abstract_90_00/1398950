Increased resistance to infection with Brucella abortus 2308 resulted when recombinant murine gamma interferon (rMuIFN-gamma) was given to mice both before and during infection but not when given only before infection. Mice given rMuIFN-gamma had enhanced peritoneal and splenic macrophage bactericidal activity against B. abortus. Treatment of mice with rMuIFN-gamma plus indomethacin did not further enhance resistance to infection or macrophage bactericidal activity compared with that after treatment of mice with rMuIFN-gamma alone.
