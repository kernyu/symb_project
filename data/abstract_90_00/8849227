The N-(4E,8E)-5,9,13-trimethyl-4,8,12-tetradecatrien-1- ylpyridinium and N-(4E,8E)-5,9,13-trimethyl-4,8,12-tetradecatrien-1- ylpicolinium cations were evaluated for their ability to inhibit 2,3-oxidosqualene-lanosterol cyclase activity in Candida albicans. Both compounds inhibited fungal growth, were fungicidal, and resulted in the accumulation of squalene epoxide concurrent with a decrease in ergosterol, monomethyl sterols, and lanosterol, as was expected for the specific inhibition of 2,3-oxidosqualene-lanosterol cyclase activity. These compounds are electron-poor aromatic mimics of a monocyclized transition state or high-energy intermediate formed from oxidosqualene, which may explain their selective action.
