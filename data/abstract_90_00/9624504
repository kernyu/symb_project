The nucleotide sequence of a newly identified amikacin resistance gene, aac(6')-Iq (551 bp), is reported. It has 68.4 and 94.4% homology with the aac(6')-Ia gene and the recently described aac(6')-Ip gene, respectively. Analysis of its flanking sequences indicated that it is in the first cassette of a class I integron and has an attC site (59-base element) 108 bp in length.
