Amikacin resistance was studied in 380 bacterial strains of Enterobacter, Klebsiella, Serratia, Pseudomonas and E. coli isolated in clinics of the Moscow Region. It was shown that 69 isolates were resistant to amikacin. Plasmid DNA was detected in 10 amikacin resistant isolates. Three of them belonging to Klebsiella and 3 belonging to E. coli contained plasmids controlling resistance to amikacin. The plasmids isolated from the strains of Klebsiella determined as well resistance to kanamycin and streptomycin but did not control resistance to sisomicin, tobramycin and gentamicin while the plasmids isolated from the strains of E. coli determined resistance to amikacin, kanamycin, gentamicin, tobramycin and sisomicin.
