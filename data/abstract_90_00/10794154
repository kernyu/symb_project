A total of 217 strains representing all 14 currently described genomic species in the genus Aeromonas were tested for susceptibility to 69 antimicrobial agents by a microdilution method. All species were susceptible to tetracyclines, quinolones, chloramphenicol, and most of the aminoglycosides and the cephalosporins, but were resistant to lincosamides, vancomycin, teicoplanin and some penicillins. In general, no significant differences were found that correlated with the taxonomic designation or the origin of the isolates tested. The microdilution method proved to be easy to perform allowing susceptibility testing of extensive strain collections for a large number of antimicrobial agents.
