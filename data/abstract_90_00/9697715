A major problem with the use of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) protease inhibitors as monotherapy has been an unacceptably high rate of emergence of resistance. To examine possible influences on the time to emergence of resistance, 24-week data were examined from five studies in which indinavir had been administered as monotherapy or as a component of combination therapy. Monotherapy data indicated a correlation between the level of HIV-1 RNA achieved and the risk of emergence of resistance: the lower the level, the lower the risk. When combination and monotherapy regimens were compared, the group receiving indinavir + lamivudine + zidovudine had a significantly lower risk of resistance, even after adjusting for the minimum HIV-1 RNA level achieved. The findings indicate that if at all possible, HIV-1-infected patients should receive combination chemotherapy to minimize the emergence of resistance to the protease inhibitor portion of the regimen. The goal of therapy should be to decrease the HIV-1 RNA load to a less-than-detectable level.
