The involvement of a carrier for sinefungin (SF) uptake in Leishmania donovani promastigotes is indicated by saturation kinetics, competition studies and SF accumulation against a 270-fold concentration gradient across the cell membrane. Whether SF uptake occurs via nucleoside- or AdoMet-carrier systems was investigated by competition experiments and comparison of the uptake of various molecules in wild-type and SF-resistant cells. Results show that SF did not inhibit purine or pyrimidine uptake whereas it competitively inhibited AdoMet uptake. Furthermore, the uptake of nucleosides in SF-resistant cells is similar to that in wild-type cells, whereas uptake of SF and AdoMet is lower.
