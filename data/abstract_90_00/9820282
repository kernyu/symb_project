Chondrosarcomas are alleged to be resistant to chemotherapy. A retrospective review of our experience primarily with dedifferentiated chondrosarcomas treated with chemotherapy was performed to reevaluate the efficacy of chemotherapy for this tumor. There were 18 patients: 14 stage IIB and four stage III. Seventeen patients had dedifferentiated chondrosarcoma. The median age at diagnosis was 57 years. Fourteen of the patients underwent wide excision of the tumor, two underwent amputation, and two had no surgery. The femur and the pelvis were the most common locations of the primary tumor. Chemotherapy for 11 of the patients consisted of cisplatin and doxorubicin. Survival was analyzed with the Kaplan-Meier method; the median survival was 12 months. The hypothesis that chondrosarcomas express P-glycoprotein was tested. Expression of P-glycoprotein was evaluated by immunostaining with use of the C494 and C219 antibodies on 41 benign and malignant cartilage tumors, six of which were from the patients in the chemotherapy group. Immunostaining revealed that 37 of 41 cartilage tumors expressed P-glycoprotein. The rate of survival of patients with high-grade chondrosarcoma treated with chemotherapy is poor. P-glycoprotein expression is common in benign and malignant cartilage lesions. The lack of response to chemotherapy may be related to the expression of P-glycoprotein.
