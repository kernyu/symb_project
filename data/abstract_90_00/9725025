We have examined the influence of subinhibitory concentrations of several antifungals, the different glucose and ammonium sulphate concentrations in the culture medium as well as the strain variability on the expression in vitro of stress mannoproteins reactive with salivary sIgA in C. albicans and other Candida spp isolates. Irrespective of the conditions used, no reactivity with salivary sIgA was observed in yeast cells grown at 25 degrees C. However, when grown at 37 degrees C, all of the 10 C. albicans strains, but only 9 out of 28 non-C. albicans isolates studied showed reactivity with salivary sIgA. Cells grown at 37 degrees C in medium containing maximum concentrations of glucose and ammonium sulphate expressed the antigens reactive with sIgA during longer periods of time than the cells grown in medium with minimal concentrations of the same compounds. The regulatory role showed by the concentration of glucose and ammonium sulphate on the antigenic expression was subordinated, nevertheless, to the most important factor, the temperature of incubation. Only isolates showing low susceptibility expressed the antigens reactive with sIgA under the influence of subinhibitory concentration of antifungals. However, induced resistance to one of the antifungals tested (5 fluorocytosine) allowed the antigenic expression at elevated subinhibitory concentrations even in previous susceptible strains. In conclusion, in addition to the temperature, factors such as characteristics of the strain, the concentration of glucose and ammonium sulphate in the culture medium and the resistance to antifungals played a role on the expression of C. albicans antigens reactive with sIgA, which could be of clinical relevance in the course of infection.
