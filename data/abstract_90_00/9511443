The results of comprehensive study of clinical, hematological, immunological, and bacteriological parameters in irradiated rats and dogs are presented. There is a growth of the automicroflora with decreases in leukocytes by 30-40%, lysozyme, beta-lysine, phagocytosis, total serum bactericidal activity by 10-20%. The appearance of pathogenic properties and resistance of Escherichia coli to antibiotics was observed with 60-70% reductions in the activity of nonspecific antiinfectious resistance and with 75-85% falls in neutrophils. This causes clinical manifestations of infectious complications. The appearance of hemolytic properties of Escherichia coli promotes the development of hemorrhagic complications at the sites of its natural habitation. The changes found in different periods after irradiation in the hematologic, immunological, and particularly bacteriological parameters may be criteria for predicting infectious complications and using therapeutical features in time.
