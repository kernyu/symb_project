BACKGROUND: Many bacteria have become resistant to commonly-used antibiotics. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of a cadexomer iodine wound dressing on methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). METHOD: Partial thickness wounds were made on the backs of three pigs and inoculated with a known amount of MRSA. Wounds were treated with either cadexomer iodine dressing or vehicle dressing (without iodine), or they were left untreated. Three wounds from each treatment group per animal were cultured using quantitative scrub techniques after 24, 48, or 72 hours of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The cadexomer iodine dressing significantly reduced MRSA and total bacteria in the wounds as compared to both the no treatment control and vehicle. No significant differences were observed in the number of bacteria recovered between the no treatment control and cadexomer (vehicle) treated wounds. Cadexomer iodine may be an effective agent for preventing proliferation of MRSA in wounds.
