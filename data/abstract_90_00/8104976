A total of 1896 isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa resistant to aminoglycosides and isolated during the period 1983-1989 in two Belgian general hospitals were included in this study. The most frequently encountered O serotypes were O4, O11, O12 and non-typable isolates. The majority of the isolates showed resistance to extended spectrum beta-lactam antibiotics (cefotaxime, ceftriaxone and cefepime). However, a low degree of resistance was found for ceftazidime. By contrast, amikacin and isepamicin, remained active on a significant number of aminoglycoside resistant isolates. In both hospitals, impermeability and AAC(3)II enzyme production were the most prevalent aminoglycoside resistance mechanisms. There were marked differences between the two hospitals with regard to the distribution of the O-serotypes and resistance profiles.
