The in vivo and in vitro response of Plasmodium falciparum to chloroquine was conducted in Ankazobe, a village located in the high plateau area. These studies confirmed the low level of chloroquine-resistance. The in vivo data indicate the absence of increase resistance during the 2 years study. Chloroquine is still the drug of choice for the treatment of malaria attack in this area.
