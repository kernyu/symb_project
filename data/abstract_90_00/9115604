A 3-year-old male from Bolivia who sustained a full-thickness 80 per cent TBSA burn complicated by smoke inhalation on the 28 March 1995 was admitted to our burn centre on 6 April 1995. On 11 April the patient's wounds were colonized with a Serratia marcescens sensitive only to ciprofloxacin and imipenem. Sputum cultures revealed the same phenotypic S. marcescens. Two patients who were admitted days later had the same phenotypic S. marcescens. Their TBSA burns ranged from 54 to 80 per cent. Both were injured in early April. Sputum and wound cultures were also positive for S. marcescens. Precautionary measures were instituted immediately. All potential reservoirs were cultured. Cultures were negative for S. marcescens. Patient therapy was maintained via strict isolation. The first patient died on 17 May. The two remaining patients survived and were discharged colonized with S. marcescens. However, the biotype of the initial S. marcescens was different from the latter two. Early recognition of a multiresistant S. marcescens resulted in negating the spread of this agent to other patients.
