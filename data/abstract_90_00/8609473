Nucleotide sequences of regions of the envelope (env) and polymerase (pol) genes of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) proviral DNA were obtained from sequential blood and autopsy samples from an AIDS patient who had been treated with zidovudine for 9 months. Phylogenetic analyses showed that a reduction in genetic heterogeneity of the env regions of viruses present in the proviral blood population occurred during therapy, and this coincided with an increased pol gene heterogeneity. Differences were observed in different organs obtained post mortem for both the env and pol coding regions. The cardiac blood proviral population consisted mainly of variants which possessed sequences containing mutations at position 215 of the pol gene, associated with drug resistance. By contrast, the brain population consisted entirely of zidovudine sensitive genotypes, and this organ also harboured variants with genetically distinct env sequences. The lymph tissues obtained after death held more diverse proviral env and pol populations, containing both zidovudine sensitive and resistant genotypes.
