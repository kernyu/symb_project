Certain MHC class I molecules on target cells are known to inhibit the cytotoxic action of NK cells. By using monoclonal antibody (mAb) Cho-1, we have found inhibitory non-MHC class I cell surface molecules that are noncovalently-associated with 200 kDa and 40 kDa antigens. Poly I-C-induced rat NK cells were not cytotoxic to rat fetus-derived fibroblast WFB cell line. In contrast, NK cells were cytotoxic to H-ras oncogene-induced transformants of WFB, W14 and W31. FACS analysis indicated that mAb Cho-1 reacts with WFB, but not with W14 and W31 cells. Thus, this antigen may disappear concomitantly with cell growth and transformation. Cho-1 antigens were also expressed on other NK-resistant lines, such as mouse BALB3T3 fibroblast, EL-4 lymphoma and human fibroblast HEPM. However, they were not expressed on NK-sensitive mouse YAC-1 and H-ras transformant (Brash) of BALB3T3 cells. Furthermore, treatment of target cells with IFN-gamma clearly induced the cell surface expression of Cho-1 antigens, and conferred a resistance to NK cytolysis on target cells. These data strongly suggest that Cho-1 antigen expression may correlate with target cell susceptibility to NK cells. Indeed, treatment of NK-resistant WFB as well as HEPM cells with F(ab')2 fragments of mAb Cho-1 resulted in the acquisition of susceptibility to NK cytolysis. Cho-1 antigens may be novel molecules that regulate the NK resistance of cells.
