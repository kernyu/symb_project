The in vitro sensitivity of nine Trichomonas vaginalis isolates to commonly employed 5-nitroimidazoles (metronidazole, nimorazole, ornidazole and tinidazole) was evaluated in absence and in presence of sub-inhibitory concentrations of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Co-incubation with H2O2 and 5-nitroimidazole compounds decreased the MIC values of the strains exhibiting cross-resistance to these drugs. It was suggested that H2O2 produced in the inflammatory process during trichomonal infection could enhance the therapeutic effect of 5-nitroimidazole drugs.
