Clostridium ramosum, C. innocuum, and C. clostridioforme are frequently isolated from clinical specimens including blood. Because of Gram stain variability, a lack of spores, and atypical colonial morphology, identification of these species is often difficult. Three anaerobe identification kits were evaluated for their abilities to identify these species. For comparison, 11 strains of C. perfringens were evaluated in parallel. By using profile numbers and codebooks, the correct genus and species were identified, as follows: with the RapID ANA II kit, 100% (20 of 20) of C. ramosum isolates, 24% (5 of 21) of C. innocuum isolates, and 50% (10 of 20) of C. clostridioforme isolates; with the AnIDent kit, 60% (12 of 20) of C. ramosum isolates, 28% (6 of 21) of C. innocuum isolates, and 90% (18 of 20) of C. clostridioforme isolates; with the ATB32A kit, 70% (14 of 20) of C. ramosum isolates, 0% (0 of 21) of C. innocuum isolates, and 40% (8 of 20) of C. clostridioforme isolates. Profile numbers that overlapped several species were obtained as follows: with the RapID ANA II kit, 0% of C. ramosum isolates, 76% of C. innocuum isolates, and 40% of C. clostridioforme isolates; with the AnIDent kit 40% of C. ramosum isolates, 62% of C. innocuum isolates, and 5% of C. clostridioforme isolates; with the ATB32A kit, 15% of C. ramosum isolates, 52% of C. innocuum isolates, and 25% of C. clostridioforme isolates. One strain of C. innocuum was misidentified by the AnIDent kit, and the remainder yielded profile numbers that were not listed in the codebooks. The MICs of 11 antimicrobial agents including penicillin G, metronidazole, clindamycin, cefoxitin, cefotetan, imipenem, meropenem, amoxicillin-clavulanate, ampicillin-sulbactam, piperacillin-tazobactam, and vancomycin were determined by the agar dilution method. All C. perfringens strains were susceptible to all antimicrobial agents tested. Various levels of resistance to cefoxitin, cefotetan, and penicillin G were noted with C. ramosum, C. clostridioforme, and C. innocuum. In addition, resistance to clindamycin was noted with C. ramosum (5%) and C. innocuum (10%). Most strains of C. innocuum were only moderately susceptible to vancomycin (MIC at which 90% of strains are inhibited, 4 micrograms/ml).
