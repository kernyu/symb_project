UNLABELLED: Neisseria meningitidis is the most prevalent micro-organism involved in paediatric bacterial meningitis in the Barcelona area in children over 3 mo of age and it is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in Spain. A total of 498 strains of N. meningitidis, obtained between the years 1986 and 1997 from children with sepsis and/or meningitis, were characterized according to their serogroup and penicillin resistance; their distribution in serotypes and subtypes was studied from 1990. A decreasing tendency in the number of annual isolates was observed in this period. Most isolates belonged to serogroups B (403 strains) and C (77 strains). Serogroup C accounted for 1.8% of the strains in 1986 and 57.1% in 1997. The most prevalent phenotype between 1990 and 1996 was B:4:P1.15. but C:2b:P1.2,5 was the most prevalent in 1997. Overall penicillin-resistance rates ranged from 9.1% in 1986 (when a non-susceptible strain was isolated for the first time in the Hospital Sant Joan de Deu, Barcelona, Spain) to 71.4% in 1997, and it was more common among strains belonging to serogroup C (52% of resistant strains) than to serogroup B (22.1 % of resistant strains). The penicillin-resistance level was low, MIC always < or = 0.5 microg/ml. The present increase in N. meningitidis group C isolates, mainly C:2b:P1.2,5, and the availability of preventive measures for this highly pathological and resistant phenotype, argues strongly for the establishment of an epidemiological monitoring system. Detection of penicillin resistance should be standardized worldwide in order to unify data from all laboratories. CONCLUSION: A shift between serogroups B and C is observed in Barcelona from 1986 to 1997, as well as a rapid distribution of decreased penicillin susceptibility.
