Treatment of Vibrio cholerae el tor strain SLH22(J) with nitrofurantoin induced dose-dependent prophage 'kappa', the maximum induction being 6-fold the spontaneous induction level. UV-inactivated 'kappa' phages were Weigle reactivated, the maximum Weigle factor being 1.8 and 2.0 respectively in nitrofurantoin and UV pretreated el tor strain H218 Smr. Nitrofurantoin treatment also caused significant filamentation of the el tor strain H218 Smr and mutation of these cells from ampicillin sensitivity to ampicillin resistance. The levels of the four SOS-like responses induced by this drug were low but significant.
