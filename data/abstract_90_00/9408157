The resistance pattern of 2816 isolates from 17631 blood cultures and the etiology of isolates causing bacteremia and fungemia among 14591 admissions were investigated in an 80-bed single cancer institute during seven years (1990-1996) under the same empiric therapeutic antibiotic policy but with different prophylactic strategies. No change was found in the proportion of Gram-positive versus Gram-negative bacteria isolated from bacteremias (70% vs. 30%) during the past seven years. Furthermore, the proportion of coagulase-negative staphylococci and enterococci was about the same before and after the introduction of ofloxacin in prophylaxis. However, the proportion of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia causing bacteremia increased. There was no increase in Candida krusei and Candida glabrata after the introduction of fluconazole into our prophylactic regimen in 1992. Penicillin-resistance in viridans streptococci increased after penicillin was introduced into prophylaxis in acute leukemia in 1993. Until 1995 no quinolone-resistant Enterobacteriaceae were observed. Susceptibility to quinolones did not significantly change within the past seven years in Enterobacteriaceae after their introduction to prophylaxis in 1991, but Pseudomonas aeruginosa decreased from 90 to 58.2%. Glycopeptide resistance in enterococci and staphylococci was minimal in the observed period (0.9-4.3%).
