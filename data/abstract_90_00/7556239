The susceptibility of 2,426 gram-negative bacteria obtained from 18 Spanish hospitals to ciprofloxacin was evaluated. Among different medical centers, susceptibility to ciprofloxacin ranged from 83 to 100% for Enterobacteriaceae, from 35 to 100% for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, from 0 to 100% for Xanthomonas maltophilia, Acinetobacter spp. and other gram-negative non-fermenting bacilli, and from 33 to 100% for Campylobacter spp. All clinical isolates of Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae were susceptible to ciprofloxacin.
