The development of pleiotropic drug resistance (PDR) in vivo in solid tumour models suggests that a similar process may occur in the clinic. A subline of the Ridgway osteogenic sarcoma (ROS)--a murine subcutaneously-growing solid tumour--with moderate resistance (1.5 fold) to actinomycin D was selected by repeated suboptimal treatment with this drug in vivo. This subline (ROS/ADX/G2) showed cross-resistance to vincristine (3.5 fold) and etoposide (over 5.1 fold) but not to doxorubicin. The resistance could in all cases be partly or completely overcome by treatment with non-cytotoxic doses of verapamil or clomipramine. Resistance to actinomycin in this model was associated with lower (up to 3.2 fold) drug accumulation into tumours which could be increased (up to 2.8 fold) by treatment with 25 micrograms/g verapamil. These data support clinical trials of the use of membrane-active agents to overcome PDR.
