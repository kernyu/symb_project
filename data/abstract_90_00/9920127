All episodes of bacteraemia during a 15-year period (1981-1995) in the County of Northern Jutland, Denmark, were analysed with regard to antibiotic resistance. A total of 8840 isolates from 7938 episodes of bacteraemia was identified. Over time, no changes in bacterial aetiology were noted. Three isolates of Staphylococcus aureus were methicillin resistant (0.2%) and six were gentamicin resistant (0.4%). Among coagulase-negative staphylococci a 14% increase in resistance to penicillin was observed (95% confidence intervals, CI: 2-26%). Likewise, the frequency of resistance to methicillin, gentamicin and erythromycin increased, the corresponding figures being 38% (CI: 26-50%), 26% (CI: 14-38%) and 32% (CI: 16-50%), respectively, whereas a 14% decrease in resistance to streptomycin was recorded (CI: 4-24%). A 20% (CI: 2-37%) increase of coagulase-negative staphylococci resistant to three or more antibiotics was observed. The frequency of ampicillin resistance increased by 9% among Escherichia coli (CI: 4-13%) and by 10% (CI: 6-14%) in all Enterobacteriaceae. Among Enterobacteriaceae the level of resistance to third-generation cephalosporins, carbapenems, aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones remained low (<1%). The frequency of resistance to three or more antibiotics remained fairly stable among Enterobacteriaceae, although a slight increase was noted among E. coli (5%; CI: 0-10%) The recommended regimen for empirical antibiotic treatment in this region (a combination of penicillin G or ampicillin and an aminoglycoside) provided an overall coverage of 94% (CI: 94-95%), although a slight decrease was noted at the end of the period. In conclusion, acquired antibiotic resistance was maintained at a low level compared with most other European countries and regions during the 15-year period studied.
