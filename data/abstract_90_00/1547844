One hundred and twenty-eight shigella strains isolated from newborn and infant human faecal specimens at Kaohsiung Medical College Hospital in Taiwan were serogrouped, serotyped and examined for drug-resistance patterns and for the presence of plasmids. Forty-seven per cent of the isolates were found to belong to the Shigella sonnei serogroup, 41% to the S. flexneri group, 9% to the S. boydii group and 3% to the S. dysenteriae group. The serotype with the greatest number of strains was S. sonnei I. (29%) followed by S. flexneri 1 (27%). Each strain was tested for resistance to 11 antimicrobial agents. Eight-eight per cent of the strains were resistant to tetracycline, 87% to chloramphenicol, 84% to streptomycin, 52% to ampicillin, 25% to nalidixic acid, 29% to kanamycin, 11% to cephalothin, 11% to neomycin, 10% to cotrimoxazole, 1% to amikacin and none to gentamicin. The most prevalent resistance pattern was ApCmSmTc (28%). Clinical isolates demonstrating multiple resistance were found to harbour a large transmissible plasmid of 45-75 MDa while isolates without multiple resistance did not. Two large virulence plasmids of 123 and 110 MDa were found in 12 strains of S. flexneri and 4 strains of S. sonnei phase I. Small plasmids of 4.5, 4.2, 3.5, 2.8, 2.5. 2.0 and 1.5 MDa were also present in all strains. These small plasmids were species specific and can be used as marker plasmids to identify species.
