Antibacterial substances (ABS) in the hemolymph of Astacus leptodactylus were studied by agar-plate lysis and inhibition tests. The results demonstrate ABS against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. ABS against Gram-positive bacteria were identified as a lysozyme with a molecular weight of 14 kDa, heat resistance (< 50 degrees C) and lability to freezing. ABS against Gram-negative bacteria lost 50% of their activity at 50 degrees C and completely at 70 degrees C but were stable to freezing. Both ABS are inducible; they are produced and stored in the granular and semigranular hemocytes. Lysozyme is found in treated and untreated animals, ABS against Gram-negative bacteria only after induction.
