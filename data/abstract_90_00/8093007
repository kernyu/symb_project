Previously, we identified a core undecapeptide of sapecin B having antimicrobial activity. Based on the structure of this peptide, we systematically synthesized peptides consisting of terminal basic motifs and internal oligo-leucine sequences and examined their antimicrobial activities. Of these peptides, RLKLLLLLRLK-NH2 and KLKLLLLLKLK-NH2 were found to have potent microbicidal activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, methicillin-resistant S. aureus and Candida albicans in liquid medium. We also synthesized the D-enantiomer of KLKLLLLLKLK-NH2. This enantiomer was resistant to tryptic digestion and persisted longer in the culture medium, showing greater antimicrobial activity than the original peptide.
