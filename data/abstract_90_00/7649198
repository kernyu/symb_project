A case of pneumonia caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae occurring in a patient receiving pristinamycin is reported. Despite empirical treatment with pristinamycin, 2 g/day for five days, the patient's condition worsened. Protected brush specimen and blood cultures permitted isolation of Streptococcus pneumoniae. MIC testing indicated that the strain was susceptible to pristinamycin and resistant to erythromycin and penicillin. Streptococcus pneumoniae was eradicated by cefotaxime, and pneumonia resolved. This case underlines the fact that pristinamycin may not be suitable for the treatment of multiresistant pneumococcal infections.
