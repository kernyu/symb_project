The in vitro susceptibility to amphotericin B, fluconazole, itraconazole and ketoconazole of 545 Candida strains from patients treated at the University Hospital of the Canaries was determined by means of a microdilution test. The distribution of the species was as follows: Candida albicans (342), Candida tropicalis (70), Candida glabrata (68), Candida parapsilosis (65). Of Candida albicans isolates, 8.5% and 7.6% showed resistance to itraconazole and fluconazole respectively. Of C. tropicalis isolates 34.3%, 27.1% and 2.9% were resistant to itraconazole, fluconazole and ketaconazole respectively. For C. glabrata, 10.3% and 4.4% of the isolates under study demonstrated resistance to fluconazole and itraconazole respectively. Only 4.6% and 1.5% of C. parapsilosis isolates demonstrated resistance to fluconazole and itraconazole respectively. C. tropicalis was the most resistant strain and C. parapsilosis the most sensitive. The greatest percentages of resistance in vitro were seen with the triazoles.
