The frequency of decreased antibiotic susceptibility among 534 Gram-negative aerobic bacilli from patients admitted to intensive care units at eight hospitals in Sweden during 1997 was evaluated. MICs of cefepime, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, imipenem and piperacillin-tazobactam were determined using Etest. Reduced susceptibility (resistant and intermediate/indeterminate susceptible strains) was defined according to the MIC breakpoints of the British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy (BSAC), the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) and the new species-related breakpoints of the Swedish Reference Group for Antibiotics (SRGA). The BSAC/NCCLS/SRGA breakpoints for susceptible category (mg/L) of Enterobacteriaceae are: cefepime, not available (NA)/8/0.5; ceftazidime, 2/8/2; ceftriaxone, NA/8/0.5; ciprofloxacin, 1/1/0.12; gentamicin, 1/4/2; imipenem, 4/4/1; and piperacillin-tazobactam, NA/16/16. The most frequently isolated organisms were Escherichia coli (n = 160; 30%), Klebsiella spp. (n = 84; 16%), Enterobacter spp. (n = 77; 14%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 64; 12%) andProteus spp. (n = 28; 5%). Decreased susceptibility among E. coliusing the BSAC/NCCLS/SRGA respective breakpoints (%) were: cefepime, NA/0/2; ceftazidime, 2/2/2; ceftriaxone, NA/1/2; ciprofloxacin, 2/2/8; gentamicin, 21/0/3; imipenem, 0/0/2; and piperacillin-tazobactam, NA/4/4. Corresponding levels of decreased susceptibility (%) among Klebsiellaspp. were: cefepime, NA/0/5; ceftazidime, 2/1/2; ceftriaxone, NA/1/10; ciprofloxacin, 4/4/19; gentamicin, 25/2/5; imipenem, 0/0/0; and piperacillin-tazobactam, NA/10/10; and among Enterobacter spp. were: cefepime, NA/1/19; ceftazidime, 30/29/30; ceftriaxone, NA/30/36; ciprofloxacin, 3/3/15; gentamicin,18/0/0; imipenem, 0/0/5; and piperacilllin-tazobactam, NA/27/27. In conclusion, the species-related SRGA breakpoints detected Gram-negative isolates with decreased susceptibility in comparison with the native population with higher frequency than did the NCCLS breakpoints. The BSAC breakpoints for susceptible organisms were similar to NCCLS for ciprofloxacin and imipenem, and similar to SRGA for ceftazidime but lower than both NCCLS and SRGA for gentamicin, causing a much higher frequency of decreased susceptibility to gentamicin.
