Thoracic actinomycosis is a rare infection but sensitive to penicillin G which is the antibiotic of choice. We report a case of thoracic actinomycosis which was characterised by a relapse, probably linked to antibiotic resistance following treatment with Tetracycline. This relapse presented as diffuse nodular dissemination, of miliary type, of which there are only a few examples in the literature.
