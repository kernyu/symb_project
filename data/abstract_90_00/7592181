Options for treating disseminated Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) disease have improved. However, efficacy is not always certain, resistance is common and rapidly bactericidal agents would improve efficacy and prevent resistance. Certain oxazolidinones were tested against MAC strains and inhibited growth at expected serum concentrations or lower. Activity correlated with hydrophobicity and one agent was bactericidal at concentrations two to five times greater than the MIC.
