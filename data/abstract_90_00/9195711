The present study investigated the influence of supplementation with cotton seed cake on the resistance of the Small East African breed of goats to primary and secondary challenges with Trypanosoma congolense and on their response to chemotherapy with diminazene aceturate. The supplemented group received 300 g of cotton seed cake per day in addition to about 500 g of fresh napier grass which was available to the unsupplemented group. It was observed that the supplemented infected (SI) group tended to sustain higher intensities of parasitaemia than the unsupplemented infected (USI) group particularly during the primary challenge and both groups showed longer prepatent periods to secondary challenge than to primary challenge. Infection caused a significant reduction in the rate of live body weight gain in the USI group compared with the unsupplemented control (USC) group whilst the SI group grew at the same rate as the supplemented control (SC) group. This effect was observed both during primary and secondary challenges. Following primary challenge, both infected groups developed similar degrees of anaemia, but the packed red cell volume (PCV) levels in the SI group improved towards the end of the first challenge and were also significantly higher than those of the USI group during the second challenge. After treatments at 56 and 126 days after infection (DAI), the greatest response was observed in PCV values. The response of the SI group was superior to that of the USI group and by 4 weeks after treatment the PCV values of the SI and SC groups were similar while those of the USI group were significantly lower than those of the USC group. It is concluded that supplementation with cotton seed cake plays an important role in the rate of live weight gain, and rate of recovery from anaemia produced by trypanosome infection in goats.
