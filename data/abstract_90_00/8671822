BACKGROUND: Cyclosporin (CsA) is a potent immunosuppressive drug whose main side-effect is nephrotoxicity. In the kidney, CsA induces vasoconstriction with a decrease in renal blood flow (RBF) and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and a significant increase in renal vascular resistance (RVR). CsA enhances platelet-activating factor (PAF) synthesis in mesangial cells in vitro. PAF, a secondary mediator of anaphylaxis and inflammation, exhibits vasoactive properties in the kidney similar to those of CsA. METHODS: The in situ autoperfused rat kidney model was used to investigate whether PAF plays a role in the haemodynamic injury induced by CsA. RESULTS: In this model, CsA (40 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg i.v.) induced a significant decrease in RBF and in GFR and an increase in RVR. BN 52021, a potent and specific PAF antagonist (20 mg/kg i.v. bolus dose) induced a significant increase in GFR (137 +/- 32% of initial value, P < 0.05). BN 52021 (20 and 10 mg/kg) also significantly prevented the decline in RBF and GFR induced by CsA. CONCLUSIONS: We have demonstrated that the PAF antagonist BN 52021 can minimize the alteration of renal function induced by CsA.
