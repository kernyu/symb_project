Sixty-seven clinical isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae (40 of serotype 23F, 19 of serotype 19F, and 8 of serotype 6B) with decreased susceptibilities to penicillin and erythromycin were characterized by antimicrobial susceptibility patterns; DNA restriction endonuclease cleavage profiles of the penicillin-binding protein genes pbp1a, pbp2b, and pbp2x; random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) patterns generated by arbitrarily primed PCR; and chromosomal macrorestriction profiles based on pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. A total of 22 clones (identical or closely related pulsotypes and identical RAPD patterns) were identified; 14 clones of 23F, 6 of 19F, and 2 of 6B. Three 23F clones (26 isolates) and one 19F clone (9 isolates) expressed high-level resistance to penicillin, cefotaxime, and erythromycin (MICs >/= 256 microg/ml). These data strongly suggest that multiple high-level penicillin-, extended-spectrum cephalosporin-, and macrolide-resistant clones of S. pneumoniae have been disseminated in Taiwan.
