In this study we investigated the antifungal susceptibility of 285 strains of Candida albicans isolates at Kinki University Hospital from March 1995 to December 1996. The antifungal agents tested were fluconazole, miconazole, intraconazole, amphotericin B and flucytosine. The susceptibility testing were performed according to the broth microdilution method standardized by National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (M27-T). Most isolates of C. albicans showed relatively a low MIC value and the MIC90S were calculated at 1 microgram/ml; fluconazole, 0.125 microgram/mg; miconazole, 0.06 microgram/ml; itraconazole, 1 microgram/ml; amphotericin B, 0.25 microgram/ml; flucytosine. There was only one strain that showed high resistance against fluconazole and it showed cross-resistance against miconazole and itraconazole. There were two flucytosine resistant strains. The MICs of amphotericin B were tightly clustered and resistant strain were not observed.
