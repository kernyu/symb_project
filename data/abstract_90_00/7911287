A total of 36 clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus (29 fluoroquinolone-resistant strains and 7 fluoroquinolone-susceptible strains) were studied for the presence of point mutations in the gyrA gene by nonradioisotopic single-strand conformation polymorphism (Non-RI SSCP) analysis with silver stain. Direct DNA sequencing analysis of the PCR-amplified DNA fragments confirmed the results obtained by Non-RI SSCP analysis and revealed that fluoroquinolone resistance is closely associated with six types of mutations in the gyrA gene, of which three types of mutations were newly identified: (i) Ser-84-->Leu and Glu-88-->Gly, (ii) Ser-84-->Leu and Glu-88-->Lys, and (iii) Glu-88-->Gly. Furthermore, the novel ATT-->ATC mutation at codon 86 (silent mutation) was seen in only one fluoroquinolone-susceptible strain. All seven mutational types were separated from the wild type in a single electrophoretic step within 3 h after PCR amplification. Thus, we conclude that this new technique is a rapid, simple, and useful screening method for the genotyping of gyrA mutations associated with fluoroquinolone resistance.
