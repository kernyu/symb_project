The in-vitro susceptibilities of 1658 blood culture isolates to ciprofloxacin and 13 other antimicrobial agents were determined, and compared with the results for isolates obtained before and after the availability of ciprofloxacin in 1989. Only six (0.6%) of 995 Enterobacteriaceae were resistant to the fluoroquinolones tested; all of the ciprofloxacin-resistant strains were isolated after 1989 (P = 0.04). No significant increase in ciprofloxacin resistance was found in Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Acinetobacter spp. No resistance to ciprofloxacin was found in 124 Staphylococcus aureus isolates prior to 1989, but five (2.4%) of 208 S. aureus strains recovered after 1989 were ciprofloxacin-resistant (P = 0.16). Rates of resistance to ciprofloxacin and other antimicrobial agents commonly used to treat bacteraemic infections have remained relatively low in this Canadian teaching hospital over the past 16 years.
