Cefpirome, cefoperazone and ceftazidime were tested for their in-vitro activity against Enterococcus faecalis and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) isolates. Cefpirome was the most active cephalosporin followed by cefoperazone. Ceftazidime had only very limited activity against these strains. In experiments with cefpirome/vancomycin and cefoperazone/vancomycin combinations, synergy was detected against most MRSA strains and some enterococci. Antagonism did not occur.
