BACKGROUND: The aim of our study was to compare two 1-week, low-dose triple therapies for Helicobacter pylori eradication. METHODS: One hundred consecutive patients, suffering from dyspeptic symptoms with H. pylori infection, were randomly allocated to 7 days of treatment with omeprazole 20 mg o.m. plus clarithromycin 250 mg b.d. and either tinidazole 500 mg b.d. (group A: n = 50, 19 with peptic ulcer) or amoxycillin 1000 mg b.d. (group B: n = 50, 20 with peptic ulcer). H. pylori-status was evaluated by means of histology, culture and urease test, at entry and 8 weeks after treatment. RESULTS: Three patients did not complete the treatment. H. pylori eradication was obtained in 35 patients from group A (73%) (95% CI, 55-82%) and in 40 patients from group B (82%) (95% CI, 66-90%). On intention-to-treat analysis, the rates of eradication were similar. Side-effects occurred in seven patients from group A (14.58%) and in four patients from group B (8.33%), but none discontinued therapy because of side-effects. CONCLUSION: Both triple 1-week, low-dose omeprazole therapies gave good eradication rates with infrequent side-effects.
