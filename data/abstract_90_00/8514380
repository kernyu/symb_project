Mice were protected against a lethal infection with Listeria monocytogenes when treated with low doses of an anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody (MAb). Injection of anti-CD3 MAb induced rapid production of endogenous tumor necrosis factor (TNF) in the spleens and endogenous gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) in the bloodstreams and spleens of mice. Administration of anti-Thy1.2 MAb or a combination of anti-CD4 MAb and anti-CD8 MAb resulted in suppression of anti-CD3 MAb-induced endogenous cytokine production and antilisterial resistance. Alternatively, in vivo depletion of anti-CD3 MAb-induced TNF and IFN-gamma by the simultaneous administration of antibodies against TNF and IFN-gamma suppressed anti-CD3 MAb-induced antilisterial resistance. Moreover, injection of anti-complement receptor type 3 (Mac-1, CD11b) resulted in inhibition of anti-CD3 MAb-induced antilisterial resistance. These results suggest that the preventive effect of anti-CD3 MAb might be due to activation of phagocytes by TNF and IFN-gamma induced by stimulating CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells with the MAb. Furthermore, treatment with anti-CD3 MAb did not inhibit establishment of acquired resistance against secondary infection with L. monocytogenes.
