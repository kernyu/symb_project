The presence of correlation between the quantitative content of individual carboxylic acids and aromatic compounds of microbial origin in feces and the degree of the antagonistic activity of feces was proved in experiments on conventional laboratory rats receiving therapeutic doses of tetracyclin and pefloxacin for 8 days. Antagonistic activity was regarded as one of the factors of the colonization resistance of the intestine to the invasion of opportunistic microorganisms, and microbial metabolites studied in this work were regarded as factors contributing to the persistence of these microorganisms.
