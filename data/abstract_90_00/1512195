The high-level streptomycin resistance strA1 gene of Haemophilus influenzae Rd was cloned in plasmid pAT4 as a 2.1-kbp EcoRI insert. It was later replaced in pAT4 by the wild-type strA+ gene. Plasmid pAT4 carrying the strA+ gene is highly unstable and renders chromosomally resistant recipients sensitive to streptomycin. The strA+ gene and the instability factor both reside on a 500-base HindIII-EcoRI subfragment. The two biological activities are also expressed in Escherichia coli. Both wild-type (strA+) and mutant (strA1) genes were sequenced. They show considerable nucleotide homology with the E. coli strA+ gene and its product.
