We studied 214 patients with culture proven community acquired infections. A total of 219 organisms were isolated, of which 68.2% were Escherichia coli, 10.1% Klebsiella sp and 5.5% Proteus mirabilis. Gram positive cocci accounted for 10.5% of organisms isolated. The majority of organisms isolated were sensitive to nalidixic acid (81.1%), nitrofurantoin (80.7%), cephalexin (74.7%) and trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole (65.0%). Resistance to ampicillin was common (49.8%), as such the use of ampicillin in community acquired urinary tract infections will result in a high failure rate.
