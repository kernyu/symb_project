Our knowledge regarding the pathogenesis of infections relative to the oral cavity is rapidly expanding, similar to our overall understanding of how infectious diseases impact our daily lives. The complexity of the flora within the oral cavity is quite unique and often makes diagnosis difficult; however, it is becoming more apparent that accurate diagnostic testing is important from the standpoint of focusing appropriate therapy on pathogens within this crucial body site, and avoiding overuse of antimicrobial agents in settings of infection where they have no demonstrated benefit. New diagnostic methods are being developed to detect pathogens and rapidly delineate resistance patterns. Many will be based on new genetic assays, but they must be cost effective, sensitive, and specific. Another growing challenge is to provide adequate lab support to outpatient offices and clinics, without compromising the specimen culture or turnaround times. So many patients are being seen away from hospital laboratories that we need ways to diagnose sinusitis, pharyngitis, abscess, and other infections of the oral cavity without killing the anaerobes and other significant facultative bacteria, and without ruining the direct stains by overgrowth or inflammatory cell degradation during specimen transport. These results need to be available quickly enough to give useful information for office diagnosis in order to effect therapy. To optimize both diagnosis and treatment, a key to the future will be better communication between the clinical practitioner and laboratory, with an increasing emphasis on training expertise in medical microbiology and infectious diseases.
