The use of PCR made it possible to obtain data on the occurrence of genital mycoplasms in subjects with different pathological states of their urogenital system. The detection rate of U.urealyticum was 10.7-25.1% in males and 23.0-61.9% in females. The detection rate of Mycoplasma hominis was 6.2-11.4% in males and 3.8-22.9% in females. The detection rate of M.genitalium was 6.2-29.6% in males and 4.7-30.0% in females. The study carried out by means of amplification test systems for the detection of genes controlling resistance to tetracycline (tet-M and tet-O) and to erythromycin (erm) demonstrated that U.urealyticum contained the tet-determinant in 60% of cases and M.hominis, in 57.14% of cases. As revealed with the use of PCR techniques, the occurrence of erythromycin-resistant Ureaplasma strains was not high and was equal to 2.1%.
