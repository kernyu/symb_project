During the period 1983-1988 the incidence of peritonitis in patients undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) in Nottingham fell from 2.0 to 1.2 episodes/patient/year. Cefuroxime, given intraperitoneally for 10 days, as recommended in published guidelines, failed to cure 35% of episodes of peritonitis, although only 7% of the pathogens responsible for these episodes were resistant in vitro. Cefuroxime is probably no longer appropriate as first line treatment of CAPD peritonitis.
