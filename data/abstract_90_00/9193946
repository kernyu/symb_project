Two laboratory strains (USDA strain No. 68 isolated from the eastern shore of Maryland 15 years ago and a University of Guelph strain isolated from an Ontario broiler house 23 years ago) and 3 recent field strains of Eimeria maxima [isolated in Maryland (MD), North Carolina (NC) and Florida (FL)] were tested for their ability to induce cross-protective immunity and their sensitivities to a variety of anticoccidial compounds. To assess immunological cross-protection, 1-day-old chicks were inoculated and subsequently challenged at 10 days of age, testing all possible combinations of initial inoculating (immunizing) and subsequent challenge strain. Six days post-challenge, chicks were killed and weight gains and lesion scores were determined and compared to sham inoculated and challenged, and sham challenged age-matched controls. The 2 laboratory strains and the NC strain were fully cross-protective against each other by both these measures. In contrast, the MD and FL strains induced complete protection only against the homologous strain. Reciprocally, no other strains protected chicks completely against the FL and MD strains. Drug sensitivity studies using 10 different anticoccidial formulations at prescribed drug levels showed significant differences between the 2 laboratory strains and the 3 recently isolated field strains; more recent isolates from commercial broiler houses demonstrated complete or partial resistance to a wider range of anticoccidial compounds. No correlation was seen between cross-protection and sensitivities to anticoccidials.
