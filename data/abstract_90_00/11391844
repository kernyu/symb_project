In a population-based study involving 4019 patients in 20 peripheral health facilities in Nigeria, the outcome of presumptive malaria treatment with MSP was compared to that of CQ. The study was conducted between January 1995 and January 1996. Patients aged 6 months or more with a clinical diagnosis of malaria based on history of fever and axillary temperature > 37.5 degrees C were either treated with MSP (250 mg mefloquine, 500 mg sulphadoxine, and 25 mg pyrimethamine per tablet) or CQ (150 mg chloroquine base per tablet). The clinical cure rate was assessed by the disappearance of clinical signs and symptoms over a 7-day period. Tolerability was assessed by the incidence of adverse events (adverse drug reaction and intercurrent illness). The result shows that the clinical care rate of suspected malaria was 97.6% with MSP and 85.6% with CQ. The incidence of adverse event was 9.5% with MSP and 9.2% with CQ. The withdrawal rate was 2.0% with MSP and 5.0% with CQ; 3.5% of the patients in the CQ group withdrew due to adverse events compared to 0.47% with MSP. In conclusion it was observed that in addition to superior efficacy of MSP over CQ, fever clearance rate with MSP was comparable to that of CQ. The study also demonstrated that two tablets maximum dose of MSP is safe and effective in a large population of Nigeria malaria patients.
