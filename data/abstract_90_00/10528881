A total of 510 isolates of Micrococcaceae, 500 of staphylococci and 10 micrococci, detected in 485 (3.3%) of 14,860 consecutive blood cultures obtained from patients at a Swedish university hospital and 2 local hospitals were identified to species level and investigated for antibiotic susceptibility. The 5 most frequently isolated species were Staphylococcus epidermidis (54.8%), S. aureus (28.0%), S. hominis (3.4%), S. warneri (3.2%) and S. haemolyticus (2.8%). All isolates of S. aureus were oxacillin sensitive. Great diversity in antibiotic resistance among coagulase negative staphylococci between hospitals and different ward units in the university hospital was observed. The frequency of antimicrobial resistance among S. epidermidis correlated with the antibiotic consumption at different ward units, in particular for ciprofloxacin (p < 0.001) and co-trimoxazole (p < 0.004). The study emphasizes the importance of monitoring antibiotic consumption and resistance patterns of nosocomial staphylococci in order to avoid emergence and spread of multi-resistant bacteria within the hospital environment.
