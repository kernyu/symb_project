The purpose of this review article is to establish a relationship between pharmacological properties and clinical efficacy of the most widely used broad-spectrum veterinary anthelmintics. The impact of drug pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics on anthelmintic efficacy and resistance is discussed. We review the clinical pharmacokinetics of the currently available anthelmintics used in livestock-imidazothiazoles, tetrahydropyrimidines, benzimidazoles/pro-benzimidazoles, salicylanilides (closantel) and avermectin-type compounds. Understanding the pharmacokinetic and metabolic behaviour of broad-spectrum anthelmintics in the host, and factors modulating that behaviour, is highly important for maximizing anthelmintic utility and efficacy.
