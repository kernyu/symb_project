Short-term aldosterone (10(-6) M, 2.5 h) induces in A6-C1 cell epithelia an increase in Na transport, which is due to the in situ activation of the apical Na channel and, presumably, the basolateral Na pump (Na,K-ATPase). We have now directly measured the effect of aldosterone on the transport activity of endogenous Na pumps and hybrid Na pumps containing an exogenous alpha 1 subunit by measuring the pump current (Ip) across epithelia apically permeabilized with amphotericin B. Aldosterone (2.5 h) had no significant early effect on the maximal Ip, nor on the Na concentration required for half-maximal activation. In contrast, it increased the Ip at physiological intracellular Na concentrations (1.7-fold at 5 mM Na). This effect was blocked by the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide. Hybrid pumps containing the transfected cardiotonic steroid-resistant alpha 1 subunit of Bufo marinus were also stimulated by aldosterone (2.5 h). A long aldosterone treatment (4 days) increased the maximal Ip produced by the endogenous pumps 1.5 to 2.1-fold. In conclusion, aldosterone acts on Na pumps containing an alpha 1 subunit in two ways. During its early phase of action it stimulates their transport activity by increasing their apparent Na affinity at physiological intracellular Na concentrations. In the long term it produces an increase in the maximal transport capacity, which corresponds to the known increase in the number of Na pumps.
