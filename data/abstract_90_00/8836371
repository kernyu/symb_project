OBJECTIVES: To determine tilmicosin concentrations in serum and tissues of rabbits given a single dose of 25 mg of tilmicosin/kg of body weight. To examine the effects of tilmicosin treatment (25 mg/kg, s.c.) in rabbits with pasteurellosis. PROCEDURE: After receipt of tilmicosin, healthy New Zealand White female rabbits (n = 3 at each time) were euthanatized at 2, 4, 8, 24, 48, and 72 hours for collection of blood samples and tissue specimens; 4 rabbits served as untreated controls. Rabbits (male and female) with pasteurellosis (n = 42) also were treated. Tilmicosin concentration was determined in serum, lung, and uterine tissues. Rabbits with pasteurellosis were treated with tilmicosin. Response was monitored, using bacteriologic culturing and antibiotic resistance and susceptibility testing, and by scoring clinical signs of disease. RESULTS: Serum tilmicosin concentration reached 1.91 +/- 0.18 micrograms/ml after 2 hours, decreased to 0.77 +/- 0.07 microgram/ml by 8 hours, and was below minimum inhibitory concentrations for Pasteurella multocida at 24 hours. Terminal half-life in serum was 5.97 hours. Lung and uterus concentrations were 14.43 +/- 1.34 and 11.57 +/- 0.09 ppm at 2 hours, and were 5.10 +/- 1.05 and 8.87 +/- 1.66 ppm at 24 hours, respectively. 69% (29/42) of rabbits with pasteurellosis responded favorably in 3 days. Second treatment was required in 31% (13/42), and 5 of these rabbits had clinical signs on day 6; 2 of these 5 had improved. Treatment success rate was 93% (39/42). Of the rabbits that were culture positive on day 0, 35% (6/ 17) remained positive on day 3. 1 of 6 rabbits was culture positive on day 6. CONCLUSION: Tilmicosin (25 mg/kg, s.c.) was an effective treatment for pasteurellosis in New Zealand White rabbits. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Tilmicosin treatment of pasteurellosis in rabbits is useful in research rabbits and in those destined for meat production. A single dose of antibiotic minimizes stress-associated handling.
