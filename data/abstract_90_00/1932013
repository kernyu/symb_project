R67 dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) is a novel protein that provides clinical resistance to the antibacterial drug trimethoprim. The crystal structure of a dimeric form of R67 DHFR indicates the first 16 amino acids are disordered [Matthews et al. (1986) Biochemistry 25, 4194-4204]. To investigate whether these amino acids are necessary for protein function, the first 16 N-terminal residues have been cleaved off by chymotrypsin. The truncated protein is fully active with kcat = 1.3 s-1, Km(NADPH) = 3.0 microM, and Km(dihydrofolate) = 5.8 microM. This result suggests the functional core of the protein resides in the beta-barrel structure defined by residues 27-78. To study this protein further, synthetic genes coding for full-length and truncated R67 DHFRs were constructed. Surprisingly, the gene coding for truncated R67 DHFR does not produce protein in vivo or confer trimethoprim resistance upon Escherichia coli. Therefore, the relative stabilities of native and truncated R67 DHFR were investigated by equilibrium unfolding studies. Unfolding of dimeric native R67 DHFR is protein concentration dependent and can be described by a two-state model involving native dimer and unfolded monomer. Using absorbance, fluorescence, and circular dichroism techniques, an average delta GH2O of 13.9 kcal mol-1 is found for native R67 DHFR. In contrast, an average delta GH2O of 11.3 kcal mol-1 is observed for truncated R67 DHFR. These results indicate native R67 DHFR is 2.6 kcal mol-1 more stable than truncated protein. This stability difference may be part of the reason why protein from the truncated gene is not found in vivo in E. coli.
