Closantel is an anthelmintic which associates with plasma albumin and is useful for the control of sheep parasites, such as Haemonchus contortus, that ingest blood. However, the utility of closantel for parasite control has been threatened by the emergence of resistance. The mechanisms of resistance are unknown. A closantel-resistant and a closantel-susceptible isolate of H. contortus were compared with respect to the distribution and metabolism of closantel. Neither strain appeared to metabolise closantel in vitro or in vivo. Following treatment of infected sheep with radioactively labelled closantel, isotope levels in closantel-resistant adult H. contortus were significantly lower than in susceptible worms. This reduced accumulation of drug could contribute to closantel resistance by mechanisms such as reduced feeding, failure to dissociate the drug-albumin complex in the gut or increased efflux of closantel from resistant worms.
