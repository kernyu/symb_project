After cross-patient infection occurred with the Clinitron bed, we looked for a way to deliver an antibiotic agent into the inner environment of the Clinitron bed through the filtering system in a manner that would sterilize the contaminated microspheres. Multiple cultures of the contaminated microspheres from the Clinitron air-fluidized bed were done, and the infecting microorganisms were identified. The appropriate antibiotic powder was delivered through the filter system of the bed, and the microspheres were recultured after treatment. After an antibiotic powder was administered, the microspheres cultured were sterile. We found that the Clinitron bed can be safely, easily, and inexpensively sterilized and reused by the administration of antibiotic agent through the air filter system. Furthermore resistant bacteria can be treated with antibiotic agent sparingly used in a clinical setting because of toxicity.
