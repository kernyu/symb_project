The use of organomercurials in liquid detergents and disinfectants promoted resistance to mercury among bacteria. Dental amalgam and industries using mercury are the main source of human exposure to mercury vapor. Release of mercury from dental amalgam contributes to the enrichment of the intestinal flora with mercury resistance plasmids which may be associated with antibiotic resistance. The aim of our study was to evaluate the frequency of E. coli strains resistant to mercury and other antimicrobial agents currently used in therapy. The bacterial mercury and ampicillin, cephalexin, cefotaxime, gentamicin, tetracycline and chloramphenicol resistance was tested against 363 E. coli strains obtained from faeces and urine between 1999-2000. According to the guidelines suggested by NCCLS (1998), minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined on Mueller-Hinton agar, using the dilution technique with an inoculum of about 10(5) CFU. The MICs were read after 18 h incubation at 37 degrees C as the lowest concentration that inhibited the development of visible growth. Plasmids in enterobacteria may carry genes encoding resistance to both mercury and antibiotics. Among the tested E. coli strains, mercury resistance rose to 29.2%. Mercury resistance in E. coli is significantly linked to multiresistance to antimicrobial agents. Between 91.5-23.6 of mercury chloride resistant isolates were also resistant to the tested antibiotics. The increased use of non antibiotic antimicrobial agents is a possible selection factor for antibiotic-resistant strains in clinical and domestic environments.
