The presence of primary zidovudine (AZT)-resistance (mutation T215Y/F) or lamivudine (3TC)-resistance (mutation M184V) was evaluated in 90 drug-naive patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) between 1987 and 1997. The proportion of mutant strains in proviral samples or plasma viral samples was determined using a differential hybridization assay. Mutation T215Y/F was found in five (5.6%) patients infected between 1994 and 1997, whereas none of these patients harbored the mutation M184V. The T215Y/F mutation was present in the virus and/or provirus and persisted for at least two years. In one patient, the mutant provirus was associated with only wild-type free virus. Four of these patients were followed, and two were treated subsequently to a regimen containing AZT but with low response. The persistence of primary resistance mutations might depend on the proportion of these mutations at the time of infection, although mutant provirus might not give rise to replicating variants.
