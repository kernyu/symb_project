The eukaryotic expression vector, pFNeo, confers resistance to the antibiotic G418 and directs hematopoietic-specific expression of proteins under the control of the long terminal repeat from the Friend spleen focus-forming virus. Here, we report the entire nucleotide sequence of pFNeo. We have also constructed and sequenced a pFNeo-based expression vector (pMH-Neo) that carries an improved multiple cloning site region for easier subcloning. The utility of both vectors was demonstrated by transfection of murine T-cell hybridomas by electroporation. Transfection with either pFNeo or pMH-Neo yielded a high frequency (1 in 2 x 10(4)) of G418-resistant cell lines.
