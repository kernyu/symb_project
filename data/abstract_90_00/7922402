Three fluoroquinolone antimicrobials (norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and ofloxacin) could be used to prevent or treat infections in intensive care unit patients. All of these fluoroquinolones are particularly active against Gram-negative, aerobic bacteria. However, the pharmacokinetic properties of each fluoroquinolone are unique. Furthermore, only ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin are available for intravenous administration. Based on current, available information: a) fluoroquinolones are not endorsed for inclusion in selective decontamination protocols; b) fluoroquinolones are endorsed for empiric therapy of suspected Gram-negative bacterial infections based on local microorganism susceptibility patterns; and c) fluoroquinolones are endorsed for treatment of microbiologically documented infections based on their distribution properties, low rate of toxicity, and rapid bactericidal effect.
