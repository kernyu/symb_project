Sixty-two Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates were tested for pyrazinamidase activity, and their pyrazinamide susceptibility was determined by the radiometric method. Sequencing of pncA genes in the 23 resistant strains revealed mutations in 16 pyrazinamidase-negative strains, 11 of which had not been previously described. Six isolates containing wild-type pncA might possess alternative resistance mechanisms.
