Using a 3H-glucose incorporation assay, antifungal sensitivity testing undertaken on an isolate of Candida albicans cultured from the blood of a bone marrow transplant patient documented resistance to amphotericin B but sensitivity to fluconazole and itraconazole. Information obtained from in vitro antifungal sensitivity testing can be used to direct in vivo antifungal therapy. Widespread application of standardized in vitro antifungal sensitivity testing is needed.
