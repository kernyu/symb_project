OBJECTIVES: To determine the resistance of two dentin-bonding agents (DBAs) and a dentin desensitizer to simulated dental erosion. METHODS: Twenty teeth in each of three groups of selected premolars, with exposed cervical dentin, were treated with one of three dentin surface treatment systems: Gluma Desensitizer (Heraeus Kulzer (UK) Ltd), One Coat Bond (Whaledent (UK) Ltd), and Optibond FL (Kerr (UK) Ltd) and exposed to water (control) and an erosive challenge (Coca Cola) for 14 days. Sequential tracings of the specimens were taken, superimposed and the mean reduction in densensitizer or DBA thickness and or tooth loss determined. RESULTS: A mean loss of 77 microns (s.d. 14.6 microns) of tooth tissue over the untreated sites following 14 days exposure to Coca Cola was observed. The application of DBAs, as opposed to Gluma Desensistizer alone, over exposed dentin surfaces afforded substantial protection against erosion by Coca Cola over the period of study. The mean change in vertical profile of teeth treated with a DBA was 20 microns (s.d. 14.7 microns), almost four times less than that seen over untreated sites. SIGNIFICANCE: With the exception of Gluma Desensitizer, which was lost completely, One Coat Bond and Optibond FL demonstrated levels of acid dissolution resistance, which would be of potential value clinically.
