The acyclic purine nucleoside phosphonates, a newly described class of broad-spectrum antiviral agents, effectively inhibit human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) replication in vitro and in animal AIDS models. 9-(2-Phosphonylmethoxyethyl)adenine (PMEA) is currently being evaluated in clinical trials in patients with AIDS. In this study, we investigated the efficacy of PMEA and a related analog, 9-(2-phosphonylmethoxypropyl)diaminopurine (PMPDAP), against HIV-1 isolates exhibiting various degrees of resistance to zidovudine (azidothymidine [AZT]). HIV isolates highly (approximately 50 to 200-fold) resistant to AZT were found to be about two- to eightfold less susceptible to PMEA. A comparable degree of cross-resistance to PMPDAP, a structurally related analog of PMEA, was also observed. However, the 50% effective dose values of PMEA or PMPDAP against a panel of HIV isolates showing intermediate levels (approximately 8 to 25-fold) of AZT resistance was indistinguishable from the 50% effective dose values of PMEA (0.7 to 1.7 versus 2 microM) or PMPDAP (0.4 to 1.4 versus 0.8 to 1 microM) against HIV isolates from patients who had not previously used AZT. In addition, we were unable to generate PMEA- (or PMPDAP)-resistant HIV-1 variants by > 30 serial passages of the virus in the presence of increasing concentrations of PMEA. Careful analysis of HIV-1 isolates from patients previously treated with AZT for cross-resistance to PMEA are needed to evaluate the significance of these observations.
