Thirty-one isolates of Stomatococcus mucilaginosus were cultured from the blood (n = 6), throat (n = 23) and sputum (n = 2) of 18 hospitalized patients, 13 of whom were neutropaneic and five of whom were non-neutropaneic. Antibiotic susceptibility testing, performed by means of a broth microdilution method, showed that the minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of ciprofloxacin were > or = 4 mg/l for the isolates collected from neutropaenic patients. All these patients received ciprofloxacin as part of their prophylactic regimen. In contrast, the MICs for four of five isolates collected from non-neutropaenic patients, none of whom were receiving ciprofloxacin, were < or = 2 mg/l. In addition, 14 of the 31 isolates were cultured from seven neutropaenic patients, admitted to the same ward over a 12-week period. To evaluate possible cross-acquisition of strains between patients, cluster analysis of all 31 isolates was performed using phenotypic characteristics, MIC values and acid production from carbohydrates (API 50 CH). Overall, 22 isolate clusters were distinguished. In five of 18 patients, two or more isolates were cultured which belonged to different clusters. In only one patient, identical isolates were cultured from blood and from the throat. All six isolates of cluster 7 were cultured within the aforementioned 12-week period from three neutropaenic patients. These data support the possibility of cross-acquisition of strains between patients although its frequency seems to be low.
