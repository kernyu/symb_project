Humoral and cell-mediated immune responses of inbred BALB/c male mice were assayed for differential reactivities associated with behavioral sidedness, which was evaluated by spontaneous rotational behavior in a circular cage model system. Mice with left-turning preference had lower in vivo primary IgM and IgG anti-Keyhole Limpet Hemocyanin (KLH) antibody responses, delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) responses, and host-resistance against the intracellular bacteria, Listeria monocytogenes, than mice with right-turning preference. The only immune parameter not shown to be associated with turning preference was the secondary humoral immune response to KLH. The weak innate immune response of left-turners for clearance of Listeria showed close intercorrelation with elevated serum IL-6 levels. Serum corticosterone and splenic norepinephrine levels were differentially increased and decreased by infection, respectively. We suggest that the observed differential immune reactivities of individual animals with same age, gender, and genetic background are associated with functional asymmetries within the brain, that the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and sympathetic innervation are involved in the regulatory brain: immune interconnection after infection, and that the HPA axis and sympathetic nervous system are involved in the brain laterality effects on immune responses.
