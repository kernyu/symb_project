The Bacteroides-Cytophaga-Flavobacterium branch of the eubacterial phylogenetic tree contains a diverse group of bacterial species. Techniques for the genetic manipulation of Bacteroides spp. are well developed (A. A. Salyers, N. B. Shoemaker, and E. P. Guthrie, Crit. Rev. Microbiol. 14:49-71, 1987). Recently we developed techniques to genetically manipulate the gliding bacterium Cytophaga johnsonae (M. J. McBride and M. J. Kempf, J. Bacteriol. 178:583-590, 1996). We now demonstrate that some of these techniques allow genetic manipulation of a number of environmentally or medically significant bacteria in this group. The Bacteroides transposon Tn4351 was introduced into Cytophaga hutchinsonii, Cytophaga succinicans, Flavobacterium meningosepticum, Flexibacter canadensis, Flexibacter sp. strain FS1, and Sporocytophaga myxococcoides by conjugation. Tn4351 integrated itself into the host chromosomes and conferred erythromycin resistance. We isolated several auxotrophic mutants of Flavobacterium meningosepticum following Tn4351 mutagenesis. The C. johnsonae-Escherichia coli shuttle vector pCP11 functioned in C. succinicans but not in the other bacteria. pLYL03 did not replicate in any of these bacteria and should function as a convenient suicide vector. The identification of a system of gene transfer, a selectable marker, a suicide vector, and a transposon that functions in these diverse bacteria allows genetic manipulations to be performed.
