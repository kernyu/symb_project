1. In the present study, the precursors of endothelin-1, endothelin-2 and endothelin-3 were tested for their pressor and bronchoconstrictor properties in the anaesthetized guinea-pig. In addition, the effects of big-endothelin-1 and endothelin-1 were assessed under urethane or ketamine/xylazine anaesthesia. 2. When compared to ketamine/xylazine, urethane markedly depressed the pressor and bronchoconstrictor properties of endothelin-1 and big-endothelin-1. 3. Under ketamine/xylazine anaesthesia, the three endothelins induced a biphasic increase of mean arterial blood pressure. In contrast, big-endothelin-1, as well as big-endothelin-2 (1-38), induced only sustained increase in blood pressure whereas big-endothelin-3 was inactive at doses up to 25 nmol kg-1. 4. Big-endothelin-1, but not big-endothelin-2, induced a significant increase in airway resistance. Yet, endothelin-1, endothelin-2 and endothelin-3 were equipotent as bronchoconstrictor agents. 5. Big-endothelin-1, endothelin-1 and endothelin-2, but not big-endothelin-2, triggered a marked release of prostacyclin and thromboxane A2 from the guinea-pig perfused lung. 6. Our results suggest the presence of a phosphoramidon-sensitive endothelin-converting enzyme (ECE) which is responsible for the conversion of big-endothelin-1 and big-endothelin-2 to their active moieties, endothelin-1 and 2. However, the lack of bronchoconstrictor and eicosanoid-releasing properties of big-endothelin-2, as opposed to endothelin-2 or big-endothelin-1, suggests the presence of two distinct phosphoramidon-sensitive ECEs in the guinea-pig. The ECE responsible for the systemic conversion of big-endothelins possesses the same affinity for big-endothelin-l and 2 but not big-endothelin-3. In contrast, in the pulmonary vasculature is localized in the vicinity of the sites responsible for eicosanoid release, an ECE which converts more readily big-endothelin-1 than big-endothelin-2.
