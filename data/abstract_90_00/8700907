Membrane preparations enriched in plasma membrane vesicles prepared from promastigotes of Leishmania tarentolae were shown to accumulate thiolate derivatives of 73As(III). Free arsenite was transported at a low rate, but rapid accumulation was observed after reaction with reduced glutathione (GSH) conditions that favor the formation of As(GS)3. Accumulation required ATP but not electrochemical energy, indicating that As(GS)3 is transported by an ATP-coupled pump. Pentostam, a Sb(V)-containing drug that is one of the first-line therapeutic agents for treatment of leishmaniasis, inhibited uptake after reaction with GSH. Vesicles prepared from a strain in which both copies of the pgpA genes were disrupted accumulated As(GS)3 at wild-type levels, demonstrating that the PgpA protein is not the As(GS)3 pump. These results have important implications for the mechanism of drug resistance in the trypanosomatidae, suggesting that a plasma membrane As(GS)3 pump catalyzes active extrusion of metal thiolates, including the Pentostam-glutathione conjugate.
