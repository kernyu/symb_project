In an attempt to determine the effect of hyperinsulinemia on sympathetic function, release of norepinephrine (NE) from isolated aorta by insulin was measured in Wistar rats with insulin resistance. Insulin resistance was produced when the hypoglycemic action of glibenclamide at a dose of 10 mg/kg was almost abolished in rats that received daily injections of long-acting insulin for 15 days. Moreover, the stimulatory effect of insulin on glucose uptake was markedly reduced in both skeletal muscle strips and white adipocytes obtained from these rats with insulin resistance. However, the stimulatory effects of insulin at concentrations from 5 to 15 U/l on the release of NE from the aortic strip of insulin-resistant rats were not modified in the same manner but only slightly reduced compared with that of normal rats. These results suggest that insulin desensitization was produced later in sympathetic nerve terminals than in other organs in insulin-resistant rats and this may be helpful to explain the sympathetic hyperactivity associated with diabetes in clinics.
