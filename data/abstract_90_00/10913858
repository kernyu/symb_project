We investigated whether cellular responses to various stress conditions are regulated in synchronization with the ultradian rhythm of respiratory-fermentative metabolism which is coupled to the cell cycle rhythm in continuous cultures of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The cellular resistance to heat oscillated with a peak at the late respiro-fermentative phase, which approximately corresponds to the unbudding period of the cell cycle. Cellular resistance to H(2)O(2) and that to the superoxide-generating agent menadione oscillated in the same phase as that of heat resistance. The resistance to cadmium and that to 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene, an uncoupler of energy metabolism in mitochondria, both oscillated with a peak advanced by about 80 degrees relative to that of heat resistance, approximately covering the respiro-fermentative phase. Thus, cellular resistance to various stresses in S. cerevisiae oscillated in synchronization with the metabolic oscillation in the continuous culture.
