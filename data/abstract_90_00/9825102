The effect of lomefloxacin in combination with isoniazid, pyrazinamide, streptomycin or ethambutol on the process of tuberculosis and concomitant nonspecific pathological processes in the lungs was investigated in the treatment of 69 patients with newly diagnosticated acute progressive destructive tuberculosis of the lungs and isolation of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. It was shown that lomefloxacin provided rapid disappearance of the disease clinical signs and bacillus isolation in the patients with tuberculosis due to the tubercle bacilli susceptible or resistant to the main antituberculosis drugs, acceleration of the resolution of the infiltrates and caseous lesions in the lungs and elimination of the pathological processes in the bronchi. The tolerance of lomefloxacin was satisfactory and it did not affect the tolerance of the other antituberculosis drugs.
