A cystic fibrosis patient was infected by Stenotrophomonas maltophilia over at least 15 months. The bacteria became increasingly resistant to antimicrobial agents. Determination of restriction fragment length polymorphism and ribotyping showed that resistance was due to changes in that S. maltophilia rather than to infection by another strain.
