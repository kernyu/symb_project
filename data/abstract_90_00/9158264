The clinical features and response to therapy with ciprofloxacin were studied in two groups of patients: those infected by susceptible strains of Salmonella typhi and others infected by multidrug-resistant strains. There was no significant difference in the clinical presentation, laboratory findings and outcome between the two groups. Patients infected with multidrug-resistant strains, however, defervesced in significantly longer time (5.5 days) than those infected by susceptible strains (4.35 days) (p = 0.031). In areas with high prevalence of multidrug-resistant Salmonella infection, empiric treatment with quinolones or third-generation cephalosporins of all patients with suspected typhoid fever until the results of culture sensitivity tests are available may lead to better outcome.
