The 11-chloro-quinoline derivatives 3 react with 4-aminophenol and the mono- and bis-phenol-Mannich-bases 6 to yield the 10H-indolo[3,2-b]quinoline-11-yl-amines 4 and 7. The amodiaquine analogue 7a as the best of all compounds shows a comparable activity with choroquine and inhibits a multiresistant Plasmodium falciparum strain at the same concentration. Compound 7e from the cycloquine-type was selected for an in vivo antitumor screening programme.
