Twelve field-collected populations of German cockroaches, Blattella germanica (L.), were examined for resistance to dietary abamectin at 40 ppm. Half of these populations had significantly increased resistance ratios compared with the VPI-susceptible strain, but the highest value was only 2.4. Feeding inhibition was variable but nevertheless pronounced in all 12 strains. Feeding-choice tests with two strains revealed that each strain consumed treated and untreated food about equally. Mortality was reduced in both strains. Cross-resistance from cyclodiene resistance was not found. Low-level selections with abamectin did not result in increased resistance. Whereas resistance to abamectin does not appear to be a problem at present, two potential resistance mechanisms were identified and are discussed briefly.
