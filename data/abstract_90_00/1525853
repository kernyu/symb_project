The PAR1/SNQ3 gene of S. cerevisiae, which increases resistance to iron chelators in multi-copy transformants, is identical to the YAP1 gene, a yeast activator protein isolated as a functional homologue of the human c-jun oncogene by binding specifically to the AP-1 consensus box. The observed H2O2-sensitivity of par1 mutants has been attributed to an increased sensitivity to reduced oxygen intermediates. Accordingly, par1 mutants did not survive an elevated oxygen pressure and were very sensitive to menadione and methylviologene, two chemicals enhancing the deleterious effects of oxygen. The specific activities of enzymes involved in oxygen detoxification, such as superoxide dismutase, glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase and glutathione reductase, were decreased in par1 mutants and increased after PAR1 over-expression. As in the case of oxygen detoxification enzymes, the cellular levels of glutathione were similarly affected. These observations indicate that PAR1/YAP1/SNQ3 is involved in the gene regulation of certain oxygen detoxification enzymes. The finding that H2O2 promotes DNA-binding of human c-jun is consistent with a similar function for PAR1/YAP1/SNQ3 and c-jun in cellular metabolism.
