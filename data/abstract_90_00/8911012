Romurtide given orally enhanced the nonspecific resistance against microbial infections and hematopoiesis up to the levels achieved by subcutaneous (s.c.) injection of the compound in mice. Oral romurtide conferred protection and, in consequence, enhanced therapeutic efficacy of antibiotics against systemic infections in mice. The leukocytosis followed by the elevations of colony stimulating activity in serum and the colony forming unit of granulocyte-macrophage (c.f.u.-GM) in femoral bone marrow was observed as successive event in mice treated orally with romurtide. To obtain a comparable potency to s.c. injection of the compound at a dose of 0.1 mg per mouse, oral application required doses of 3 and 10 mg per mouse for stimulating the nonspecific resistance to infection and hematopoiesis, respectively.
