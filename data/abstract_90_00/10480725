The occurrence of parasitic helminth species as well as infection intensities are markedly influenced by the type of swine production system used. The present review focusses mainly on the situation in temperate climate regions. Generally, over the past decades there has been a decrease in the number of worm species and worm loads in domestic pigs due to a gradual change from traditional to modern, intensive production systems. The reasons for some species being apparently more influenced by management changes than others are differences in the basic biological requirements of the pre-infective developmental stages, together with differences in transmission characteristics and immunogenicity of the different worm species. Control methods relevant for the different production systems are discussed. Outdoor rearing and organic pig production may in the future be confronted with serious problems because of particularly favourable conditions for helminth transmission. In addition, in organic farms preventive usage of anthelmintics is not permitted.
