Formaldehyde (FA), a chemical with low toxic potential, is used as sole selective agent for transformation in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Neither stable auxotrophic markers in recipient cells nor defined synthetic media are needed when multicopy vector YFRp1, containing the yeast SFA gene, is employed for yeast transformation. The SFA gene gives stability to the vector and its yeast (and other) passenger genes when transformants are propagated in complex media supplemented with 3-5 mM-FA. Use of inexpensive FA and non-synthetic, undefined media will lower the cost of yeast transformant propagation considerably and thus make feasible large-volume industrial application of transformants containing YFRp1 derivatives.
