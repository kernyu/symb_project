New quaternary ammonium salts [N-alkyl-N-2-hydroxyethyl-N,N-dimethylammonium ethyl phosphate (21, 22), isopropyl phosphate (23), n-butyl phosphate (24) and N-alkyl-N-2-hydroxy-3-phenoxypropyl-N,N-dimethylammonium ethyl phosphate (25, 26), isopropyl phosphate (27), n-butyl phosphate (28) and bis(N-alkyl-N-2-hydroxy-3-phenoxypropyl-N,N-dimethylammonium) malate (29), fumarate (30), succinate (31), adipate (32) and N-alkyl-N-2-hydroxy-3-phenoxypropyl-N,N-dimethylammonium tartrate (33)] were synthesized by alkylation of the corresponding trialkylammonium salts with various epoxy compounds. The new quaternary ammonium salts showed much greater bactericidal activities and antirusting effects than those of benzalkonium chloride. They had also good compatibilities since no precipitate was observed if the solution of any anionic surface active agents were added to the solution of these new quaternary ammonium salts. This property is the same as that of amphoteric surface active agents.
