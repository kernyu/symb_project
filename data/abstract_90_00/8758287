OBJECTIVE: To study the serotype epidemiology and patterns of antibiotic susceptibilities of salmonellae isolated in Hong Kong over an eleven-year period. METHODS: The laboratory information of 22 733 strains of salmonellae isolated from diarrhea stool samples of 7 public hospitals, 5 out-patient clinics and 2 public health laboratories and reported to the Salmonella surveillance system in Hong Kong from 1983 to 1993 were analysed. RESULTS: The yearly total number of isolates has remained steady, while an increasing proportion of cases occurred in the > 25 years age group with a substantial decline in the < 1 age group. Males were significantly more affected than females, particularly in those < 15 years old. S. typhimurium and S. derby were the two most commonly isolated serotypes throughout the period. An outbreak of S. portsmouth occurred which accounted for 15.3% of total isolates in that year. S. enteritidis has doubled in the last 2 years, while S. typhi has more than halved over the 11-year period. The S. enteritidis increase was seen mostly in the > 25 age groups, with those < 5 years little affected. Antibiotic susceptibility tests showed the typhoid and paratyphoid bacilli remained fully antibiotic sensitive, while non-typhoid non-paratyphoid isolates showed increasing resistance to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, and cotrimoxazole. CONCLUSIONS: Laboratory monitoring of salmonella serotypes causing diarrhea and their antibiotic susceptibilities is essential as population movements and industrial activities increase in the southern parts of China.
