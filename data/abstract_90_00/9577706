The paper presents the results of the study of species composition and biological signs of microflora of the ejaculate obtained from infertile males. The strains of the microorganisms were characterized by high adhesive capacity and multiple resistance to antibiotics. High antilysozyme activity in staphylococci and enterobacteria isolated from the sterile patients was registered. The correlation between spermatozoa motility, lysozyme level in the ejaculate and bacterial ability to inactivate lysozyme is demonstrated the hypothesis about the role of persistent properties of bacteria in pathogenesis of male infertility is discussed.
