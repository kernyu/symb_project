1. In anaesthetized cats and dogs, local intra-arterial injection of noradrenaline and alpha, beta-methylene adenosine 5'-triphosphate (mATP) reduced both nasal arterial blood flow and nasal mucosal volume (a measure of capacitance vessel function). The responses to mATP were not modified by pretreatment with the adrenoceptor antagonists phentolamine and propranolol or the purinoceptor antagonist suramin. The vascular effects of noradrenaline were not altered by suramin, but were virtually abolished by adrenoceptor antagonists. 2. After adrenoceptor blockade, frequency-dependent reductions in nasal arterial blood flow with sympathetic nerve stimulation were reduced by 25 and 39% in cats and dogs, respectively; whereas the volume response was reduced by 56% in cats and 54% in dogs. The remaining non-adrenergic sympathetic nerve-evoked vascular responses were not influenced by suramin. 3. During desensitization to mATP induced by local intra-arterial infusion for 5 min, the remaining non-adrenergic nasal blood flow and volume responses to sympathetic nerve stimulation were reduced in the dog but not in the cat. 4. It is suggested that both adrenergic and non-adrenergic mechanisms are involved in the sympathetic control of the nasal mucosa vascular bed of both species. Since desensitization to mATP markedly reduces the remaining non-adrenergic nasal vasoconstriction evoked by sympathetic nerve stimulation in the dog, ATP is a possible sympathetic mediator in the nasal vascular bed in this species.
