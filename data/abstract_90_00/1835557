Purulent pericarditis is an infrequent complication of infections originating in another body location. Symptoms and signs are often absent; a high index of awareness is required for its diagnosis. A patient recovering from extensive necrotic-hemorrhagic pancreatitis presented with tamponade due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) purulent pericarditis, further complicated by MRSA endocarditis. Treatment included pericardectomy, IV vancomycin and teicoplanin.
