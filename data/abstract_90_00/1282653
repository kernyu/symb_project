Cyclosporin A (CsA), which is an immunosuppressive drug of helper T lymphocytes, diminished a resistance of mice to influenza virus infection. Mice inoculated intravenously with trehalose-6,6'-dimycolate (TDM, a glycolipid component of the cell wall of Mycobacterium) in an oil-in-water emulsion (TDM emulsion) recovered the resistance to influenza virus infection impaired by CsA. Number of antibody-producing cells was markedly reduced in CsA- and/or TDM-treated mice. Interferon production in lung of TDM-treated mice was augmented; however, it was extremely reduced not only in CsA-treated mice, but also in CsA- and TDM-treated mice. Activities of natural killer cells of CsA- and/or TDM-treated mice were not different from that of control mice. Numbers of lymphocytes in lung of TDM-treated mice and CsA- and TDM-treated mice were more predominantly increased than that of control mice. Analysis of lung lymphocytes by flow cytometry revealed no difference between the populations of L3T4+ T lymphocytes and Lyt-2.2+ T lymphocytes in CsA- and/or TDM-treated mice and the populations in control mice. However, the population of gamma delta T cell receptor positive (gamma delta TCR+) lymphocytes increased markedly in lung of TDM-treated mice and also CsA- and TDM-treated mice. In vitro experiments showed that macrophage cultures treated with TDM emulsion released a mediator(s) which activates T lymphocytes, but not B lymphocytes. These and our earlier results suggest that the recovered anti-influenza virus resistance of CsA-treated mice by treatment with TDM emulsion was caused by elicitation of macrophages with TDM, then activation of T lymphocytes, especially gamma delta TCR+ lymphocytes.
