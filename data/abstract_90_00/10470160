A series of 2-triazenothiophene derivatives was prepared and tested to evaluate their biological activity. Two compounds inhibited the proliferation of leukemia, lymphoma and solid tumor-derived cell lines at micromolar concentrations, whereas none of the compounds were active against HIV-1. Compound 3c inhibited DNA, RNA and protein synthesis, and was also effective against KB cells resistant to etoposide and vincristine. The compounds were inactive against fungi and bacteria.
