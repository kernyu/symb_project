Streptococcus pneumoniae (the pneumococcus) is believed to have developed resistance to penicillin by the production of altered forms of penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) that have decreased affinity for penicillin. Sixty-eight clinical isolates of serogroup 6 and 19 pneumococci (MICs, < 0.015 to 8 micrograms/ml) were randomly selected from hospitals across South Africa which are at substantial geographic distance from each other. The polymerase chain reaction was used to isolate the penicillin-binding domain of PBPs 2B and 2X from the chromosomal DNAs of the bacteria; the purified PBP DNA was digested with restriction enzymes, the fragments were end-labelled and separated on polyacrylamide gels, and the DNA fingerprints were visualized following autoradiography. Fingerprint analysis revealed that at least 19 PBP 2B gene variants occur in the serogroup 6 and 19 pneumococci. The PBP 2B gene revealed a uniform profile among penicillin-susceptible isolates, with variation from this profile occurring only in isolates for which MICs were > or = 0.06 micrograms/ml. Analysis of the PBP 2X gene revealed a greater diversity in the population with 26 variant genes, including some diversity among susceptible isolates. Discrete profiles of both genes were found only within narrow bands of the penicillin MIC, so that the gene pattern predicted the MIC. PBP 2X gene variation and the lack of variability among PBP 2B genes in pneumococci inhibited at low MICs confirm that PBP 2X alteration may be responsible for low-level penicillin resistance, while alterations in both PBP 2B and PBP 2X are required for high-level resistance. The extensive diversity of PBP genes in South African serogroup 6 and 19 strains suggests that altered PBP genes have arisen frequently in this population.
