The yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) PDR5 gene product encodes a 160-kDa protein related to the large ABC family of transporters, including the human MDR1 multidrug resistance p-glycoprotein. Loss of function mutations in PDR5 result in chloramphenicol hypersensitivity. A pdr5::Tn5 loss of function mutant exhibits a markedly impaired efflux of chloramphenicol compared with that of an isogenic PDR5 (wild-type) control.
