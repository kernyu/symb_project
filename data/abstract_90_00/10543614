A novel fusion gene consisting of the open reading frame of a double-mutant (Phe22-Ser31) dihydrofolate reductase (dmDHFR) cDNA fused to the open reading frame of cytidine deaminase (CD) was constructed and characterized for the purpose of conferring simultaneous resistance to methotrexate (MTX) and cytosine arabinoside (ara-C). The kinetic properties of purified recombinant dmDHFR-CD fusion protein were compared with those of purified CD and dmDHFR. The fusion protein was found to retain enzymatic properties of both dmDHFR and CD, in that the Km and Kcat values of purified dmDHFR-CD protein were found to be virtually identical to those of CD and dmDHFR alone. Retrovirus-mediated expression of dmDHFR-CD in NIH 3T3 cells conferred significant resistance (10- to 12-fold) against MTX and ara-C, compared with mock- and single gene-infected cells and the level of resistance obtained was similar to that of cells expressing both CD and dmDHFR from a retroviral bicistronic vector. Infection of mouse bone marrow cells with the dmDHFR-CD construct also showed high levels of resistance to MTX and ara-C in a CFU-GM assay. This fusion protein confers resistance to two antineoplastic agents that differ in their mechanism of action, and may be useful in the design of gene transfer strategies for protection of target cells against multiple drugs. Since high-dose ara-C and MTX are used in the treatment of lymphomas, this vector may be of value in protecting human hematopoietic progenitor cells from the toxicity of these antimetabolites.
