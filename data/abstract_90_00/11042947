This article describes the meaning of the term clinical breakpoint. This is followed by a discussion of the parameters that need to be considered when setting valid breakpoints for active substances in veterinary medicine; in doing so we closely follow equivalent regulations and guidelines on the establishment of breakpoints in human medicine. Along with pharmacokinetic data and the results of clinical efficacy tests, susceptibility data of relevant organisms play a key role in the establishment of breakpoints. Published breakpoints are currently only available for a few modern drugs in veterinary medicine.
