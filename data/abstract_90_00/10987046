To determine potential usefulness of antimicrobial agents and to guide their prescription in the treatment of leprosy plantar ulcers, we conducted an in vitro study about germs' nature and sensitivity to antibiotics. We took samples of plantar ulcers secretion from 107 patients at Marchoux Institute. 92.5% of those ulcers were infected. These samples revealed 145 strains of micro-organisms among those, Staphylococcus aureus (70 strains) and genus Pseudomonas (41 strains) were the most frequent. These bacteria were resistant to several antibiotics currently used at Marchoux Institute (tetracycline, penicillin, cotrimoxazol and erythromicin). Antibiotics, efficient at 80% on tested strains, were expensive for patients. They cannot be recommended for the treatment of local infections. These results outline that the main treatment in plantar ulcers is based upon antiseptic solutions and keeping feet at rest. Antibiotherapy in case of extension of local infection would be based on the results of a previous study of sensitivity.
