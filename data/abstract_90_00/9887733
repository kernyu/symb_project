This study analysed 656 wound samples from patients with chronic wounds in order to determine the bacterial flora and patterns of antibiotic use and resistance. Almost all wounds (95.1%) were colonised with at least one bacterial species; 26% of all patients were on antibiotic treatment. The total number of bacterial isolates resistant to antibiotics was low.
