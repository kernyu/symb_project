Effects of short-chain aliphatic alcohols C1-C3 on the rest potential, entrance membranous resistance and spontaneous activity of the neuromuscle synapse of the muscle cells of the diaphragm of the Wistar rats have been studied. The standard electrophysiologic method of intracellular recording was used. Taking into account effects of the increased chain length on the studied parameters, the equimolar alcohol concentrations (0.2 M) were used. The studied alcohols have caused increased rest potential as well as the entrance membranous resistance of the muscle cell. They cause increased spontaneous activity of the neuromuscular synapse and later the shape of the postsynaptic signals. The effects are more manifested if the alcohol chain is longer.
