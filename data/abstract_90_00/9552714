The objective is to compare antibiotic resistance amongst gonococci isolated from different patient groups in Harare, Zimbabwe. Antimicrobial susceptibilities of Neisseria. gonorrhoeae were determined by disc sensitivity tests. The MICs for penicillin, kanamycin, ceftriaxone, norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin were determined using E-test strips. There were 147 isolates from symptomatic men, 47 isolates from symptomatic women, 29 isolates from asymptomatic women and 41 isolates from female commercial sex workers. A total of 119 (45%) isolates were PPNG and 23 (16%) non-PPNG isolates had a penicillin MIC > 0.64 mg/l. Over 90% of isolates were resistant to TMP/SMX and 16% were resistant to tetracycline. Resistance was uncommon against kanamycin (6%), erythromycin (2%) or ceftriaxone ( < 1%). For kanamycin, the MIC90 was 32 mg/l, for ceftriaxone the MIC90 was < 0.032 mg/l for non-PPNG and < 0.064 mg/l for PPNG. For norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin the MIC90 was < 0.064 mg/l for both PPNG and non-PPNG. Isolates from the commercial sex workers showed a significantly increased prevalence of PPNG, of penicillin-tolerant non-PPNG and of tetracycline resistance. Four of the 41 isolates from sex workers showed multiple resistance (to penicillin, TMP/SMX, tetracycline and kanamycin) compared to 1/223 isolates from other groups (OR = 24.0). Antimicrobial resistance is common amongst gonococci in Harare, especially with isolates from commercial sex workers. In order for STD treatment to be implemented as an effective strategy in HIV control, continued monitoring of resistance patterns is essential.
