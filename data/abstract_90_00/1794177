A 20-year-old woman developed cutaneous Mycobacterium kansasii infection following steroid infiltration of two plaques of lichen simplex. The organism was resistant to many standard antituberculous drugs and following sensitivity studies treatment with erythromycin was begun. This has been effective and well tolerated. Treatment of atypical mycobacteria with drugs not traditionally associated with antituberculous activity is being increasingly reported and, so far, resistance has not been a problem. Erythromycin has good tissue penetration with excellent activity against M. kansasii and should be considered in the therapy of similar cases.
