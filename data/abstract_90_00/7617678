Studies from our laboratory demonstrated that conditioned resistance to the syngeneic YC8 lymphoma was established by multiple conditioned stimulus (CS)/unconditioned stimulus (US) associations. The conditioned stimulus used was exposure to the odor of camphor for 1 h and the unconditioned stimulus was an injection of DBA/2 spleen cell alloantigen that shares minor histocompatibility determinants with the YC8 lymphoma. To demonstrate a cellular basis for immune resistance to the YC8 tumor, BALB/c mice primed with DBA/2 spleen cell alloantigen were conditioned using a single trial CS/US association paradigm. Conditioned animals showed a measurable conditioned elevation of the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) response to the YC8 tumor. Control groups in which the CS and US were not given in the proper sequence were unable to mount a conditioned response. These studies show that a secondary CTL response can be upregulated by the central nervous system (CNS).
