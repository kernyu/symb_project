We have carried out a limited survey in vivo of the efficacy of chloroquine (n = 39) and pyrimethamine-sulfadoxine (n = 29) as treatments for falciparum malaria in Kaling, Turkana District, northern Kenya. Both treatments were effective, achieving clinical cure (> 75% reduction in parasitaemia on day 2 with clinical improvement, and negative blood slide on day 7) in both children and adults. A limited entomological survey suggested that the main malaria vector in this area was Anopheles arabiensis.
