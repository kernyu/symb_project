Topically applied ophthalmic antibacterial preparations are widely used in the treatment of patients with superficial ocular infections. In addition, they are frequently used to augment treatment for intraocular infection administered systemically or via local instillation. Direct application delivers high concentrations of antimicrobial agents to the surface of the eye conveniently, quickly and with minimal systemic exposure to the agent. However, antibacterials are rapidly dissipated from the tear film and intraocular penetration of topical antibacterial agents is generally poor, necessitating intensive application for successful treatment of corneal infections. Therapeutic concentrations are rarely achieved at other sites in the eye. This article reviews what is known of the pharmacokinetics of topical ocular agents and how this information can be used to optimise ocular persistence and penetration and minimise systemic absorption of antibacterials. A review of the features of the most commonly employed topical antibacterials suggests that for the treatment of uncomplicated bacterial conjunctivitis there is little difference between the various agents in terms of clinical efficacy, although chloram-phenicol should be used with care because of its potential haematological toxicity. Carefully considered therapy is imperative for bacterial keratitis; fortified beta-lactam/aminoglycoside combinations are often used for these infections. The fluoroquinolones appear promising, but caution is necessary in treating keratitis of unknown aetiology with these agents alone because of inherent and emerging acquired resistance among Gram-positive bacteria.
