Leukotrienes are thought to be involved in allergen-induced airway responses. To test this hypothesis we used a newly described 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor, zileuton, and examined its effect on antigen-induced early and late bronchial responses, airway inflammation and airway hyperresponsiveness in allergic sheep. Early and late responses were determined by measuring specific lung resistance (SRL) before and serially for 8 h after antigen challenge. Airway inflammation was assessed by bronchoalveolar lavage performed before, 8 h after and 24 h after antigen challenge. Airway responsiveness was measured before and 24 h after challenge by determining the dose of inhaled carbachol that caused a 400% increase in SRL (PD400%). The sheep (n = 8) were challenged with Ascaris suum antigen once after vehicle treatment (methylcellulose) and once after treatment with zileuton (10 mg/kg in methylcellulose, p.o.) given 2 h before antigen challenge. Trials were separated by at least 21 days. Zileuton had no effect on the early bronchoconstrictor response to antigen but the drug inhibited the late bronchial response by 55% (P less than 0.05). Unlike the control trial, there was no significant increase in bronchoalveolar lavage eosinophils at 8 h post challenge in the zileuton-treated sheep. Furthermore, zileuton treatment blocked (P less than 0.05) the airway hyperresponsiveness seen 24 h after challenge. Ex vivo formation of leukotriene B4 was inhibited over several hours after a single oral dose of zileuton, indicating that the compound was acting as a 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor in vivo. These results suggest that 5-lipoxygenase metabolites contribute to allergen-induced late responses, airway inflammation and airway hyperresponsiveness in this animal model of asthma.
