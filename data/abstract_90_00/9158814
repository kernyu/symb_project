Antimicrobial resistance in pneumococci is well established. Of major concern is the development of resistance to penicillin; however, reduced susceptibility to other commonly used agents such as chloramphenicol, erythromycin, and tetracycline has also been observed with increasing frequency. We wish to report the isolation of a clinical strain of Streptococcus pneumoniae with intermediate susceptibility to penicillin (minimum inhibitory concentration, 1 mg/L), which was also resistant to numerous other antimicrobial agents.
