Aminoglycoside resistance was investigated in six clinical isolates of Stenotrophomonas (Xanthomonas) maltophilia by studying the uptake kinetics and by using a radiochemical method to detect aminoglycoside modifying enzymes. Furthermore, the lipopolysaccharides (LPS) were extracted and characterized by SDS-PAGE and chemical analysis. Dansyl-polymyxin displacement experiments confirmed the availability of anionic binding sites. Growing cells of the isolates bound dansyl-polymyxin but were not lysed.
