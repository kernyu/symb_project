Multiple resistance to albendazole, thiophanate, levamisole and orally administered invermectin was detected in an isolate of Haemonchus contortus in sheep on a farm where benzimidazole resistance had already been identified. Following a faecal egg count reduction test, this was confirmed by both critical and controlled anthelmintic tests. Different groups of sheep infected naturally or given an experimental infection with the benzimidazole-resistant isolate were treated with the recommended doses of various anthelmintics. Compared to the control group, the percentage reductions in the faecal egg counts of sheep treated with albendazole, thiophanate, levamisole and ivermectin varied between 38.2% and 79.1% and the residual worm counts between 27.3% and 57.5%. The results indicate the presence of multiple anthelmintic resistance in this isolate of H. contortus. Sheep treated with closantel showed 100% reductions in faecal egg and worm counts, indicating that this drug was very effective against the population of H. contortus on the farm.
