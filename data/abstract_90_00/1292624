The antibiotic treatment is proved to be an effective supplement for the surgical therapy of odontogenic soft-tissue infections. For the use of antibiotics the knowledge of the oral bacterial flora and its state of resistance is very essential. In a catamnestic study the clinical records of 250 patients with orofacial infections, who were under stationary treatment in the Dept. of Maxillofacial Surgery, University Clinic Gottingen, were analyzed. The results show, that the bacterial flora has not changed basically during the last decade. Predominantly mixed aerobic and anaerobic infections can be found. Increasing importance must be attached to penicillin-resistant Staphylococci and anaerobic pathogens. Penicillins must be further considered as antibiotics of the first choice. For an extension of the antimicrobial activity the combination with a betalactamase inhibitor is useful.
