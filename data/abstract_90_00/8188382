Susceptibility of mice to infection with Yersinia enterocolitica has been shown to be related to neither the Ity locus encoding for resistance to Salmonella typhimurium and other pathogens nor the H-2 locus. Recent studies in our laboratory have demonstrated that T-cell-mediated immune responses are required for overcoming primary Yersinia infection. In the present study, we investigated the course of infection with Y. enterocolitica and the resulting immune responses in Yersinia-susceptible BALB/c and Yersinia-resistant C57BL/6 mice. In the early phase of infection, the clearance of the pathogen was comparable in both strains of mice, suggesting similar mechanisms of innate resistance. Splenic T cells from Yersinia-infected C57BL/6 mice exhibited marked proliferative responses and produced gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) upon exposure to heat-killed yersiniae. By contrast, the Yersinia-specific T-cell response in BALB/c mice was weak, and IFN-gamma production could not be detected before day 21 postinfection. T cells isolated from C57BL/6 mice 7 days after infection mediated immunity to Y. enterocolitica but those from BALB/c mice did not, while at 21 days postinfection T cells from both strains mediated protection. Neutralization of IFN-gamma abrogated resistance to yersiniae in C57BL/6 mice but to a far smaller extent in BALB/c mice. Administration of recombinant IFN-gamma or anti-interleukin-4 antibodies rendered BALB/c mice resistant to yersiniae, whereas this treatment did not significantly affect the course of the infection in C57BL/6 mice. These results indicate that the cellular immune response, in particular the production of IFN-gamma by Yersinia-specific T cells, is associated with resistance of mice to Y. enterocolitica.
