The post-antibiotic effect (PAE) of RP 59500, a new streptogramin antibiotic, was determined for Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus pyogenes. A 30 min exposure of Staphylococcus aureus to 5 micrograms/ml of RP 59500 produced a PAE of 1.9-6.9 h, and a 60 min exposure of 2.5 micrograms/ml produced a PAE of 3.2-8 h. A 30 min exposure of 5 micrograms/ml of RP 59500 of coagulase-negative staphylococci produced a PAE of 2.5-7.5 h. PAEs of constitutively erythromycin-resistant staphylococcal isolates were shorter than were the PAEs of highly susceptible isolates. A 30 min exposure to 5 micrograms/ml of RP 59500 produced a PAE of 7.5-9.5 h for Streptococcus pneumoniae and a PAE of greater than 18 h for Streptococcus pyogenes. RP 59500 produced a longer PAE with Staphylococcus aureus than did vancomycin, oxacillin or erythromycin. These results suggest that RP 59500 may be administered less frequently than would be suggested by its half-life.
