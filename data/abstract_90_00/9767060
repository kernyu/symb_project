Antibiotic-resistant strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae are becoming more prevalent throughout the world; this has resulted in modifications of treatment approaches. Management of bacterial meningitis has the greatest consensus. Strategies for treating other systemic infections such as pneumonia, bacteremia, and musculoskeletal infections are evolving, in part related to the availability of new antibiotics which are active in vitro against isolates resistant to penicillin and the extended-spectrum cephalosporins. However, there are currently very limited data related to the clinical efficacy of these new agents. The studies upon which current recommendations are based are reviewed. Otitis media represents the single most common infection due to S. pneumoniae. Recommendations for treatment of acute otitis media due to drug-resistant strains and the rationale for these recommendations are discussed.
