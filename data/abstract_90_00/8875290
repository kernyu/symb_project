During the closing years of the 20th century, there has been an unprecedented number of newly recognized infectious agents and a resurgence of infectious diseases only recently thought to be conquered. These problems have been compounded by the increasing number of pathogens that have evolved resistance to antimicrobial agents. Hospitals and other institutional settings occupy a pivotal niche in the emergence of infectious agents due to factors such as the large concentrations of ill and immuno-compromised persons, evolving technologies in healthcare settings, routine breeches of host defense mechanisms, and frequent use of antimicrobial agents. Any comprehensive strategy to address emerging infectious diseases must incorporate provisions for healthcare settings, including efforts to enhance surveillance, response capacity, training, education, applied research, and routine implementation of prevention measures.
