One hundred four recent clinical isolates of Enterococcus species were screened for vancomycin resistance by using inocula of 10(5) or 10(6) CFU dispensed by pipet and by use of a cotton swab dipped in a 0.5 McFarland standard organism suspension applied to the surface of brain heart infusion agar containing 6 micrograms of vancomycin per ml. The three inoculation methods were equivalent in the detection of nonsusceptible isolates. The use of swab inoculation was convenient and less costly than the use of micropipets.
