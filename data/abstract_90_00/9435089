The biodegradation by Rhizobium huakuii PMY1 of up to 10 mM phosphonomycin as a carbon, energy, and phosphorus source with accompanying P(i) release is described. This biodegradation represents a further mechanism of resistance to this antibiotic and a novel, phosphate-deregulated route for organophosphonate metabolism by Rhizobium spp.
