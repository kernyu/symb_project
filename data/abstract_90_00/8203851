The glycylcyclines designated CL 329,998 and CL 331,002 are N,N-dimethylglycylamido derivatives of minocycline and 6-demethyl-6-deoxytetracycline, respectively. In vitro activities of these two antimicrobial agents were compared with those of tetracycline, minocycline, and seven other antimicrobial agents against 412 gram-positive organisms. Both new drugs were significantly more active than minocycline against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MICs for 90% of isolates tested, 0.25 and 0.5 microgram/ml versus 4 micrograms/ml). CL 329,998 inhibited all streptococci, lactobacilli, and Leuconostoc spp. at concentrations of < or = 0.5 microgram/ml, with CL 331,002 slightly less active against some species. All enterococci, including minocycline-resistant and multidrug-resistant isolates, were inhibited at < or = 0.5- and < or = 1.0-microgram/ml concentrations of the new drugs, respectively. Only bacteriostatic activity was evident by time-kill curves. The two glycylcyclines demonstrated activities in vitro that were superior to those of minocycline against several gram-positive bacterial species, and at relatively low concentrations, they inhibited isolates resistant to both tetracycline and minocycline.
