In our attempt to isolate mutant cell lines resistant to Newcastle disease virus (NDV) we developed an improved procedure for enrichment of NDV-resistant cells from mouse FM3A cells and isolated a novel NDV-resistant mutant cell line, Had-2, with characteristics different from Had-1, a previously reported NDV-receptor-deficient mutant strain. Had-2 cells adsorbed NDV normally but the accumulation of viral mRNAs and proteins was inhibited. Had-2 cells had to be grown at higher cell densities in order to be NDV-resistant, and it was revealed that they did not exhibit NDV-resistance when grown at lower cell densities. A conditioned medium prepared from a culture of Had-2 cells grown at high cell density was able to make a low-density culture NDV-resistant. The activity of the conditioned medium to induce NDV-resistance was completely neutralized by addition of both anti interferon (IFN)-alpha and anti IFN-beta antibodies, indicating that Had-2 cells were constitutively releasing IFNs, though their levels were rather low. Had-2 cells were also characterized by an increased sensitivity to IFNs as compared with the parental FM3A cells, since the conditioned medium containing IFNs did not render FM3A cells resistant to NDV.
