Ceftazidime use at our institution, a 580-bed county teaching hospital, has steadily increased since its addition to the formulary in 1986. In response to this increased use and because the institutional antibiogram showed increased resistance by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (from 10 to 28% resistant), the P & T Committee requested that a drug use evaluation (DUE) of ceftazidime be conducted. Analysis of this retrospective pilot study showed that 87% of ceftazidime use was inappropriate. To further evaluate ceftazidime use, to identify problems not assessed during retrospective review, and to correct problems while patients were receiving the drug, a concurrent ceftazidime use evaluation was conducted. The methods and results of the concurrent review are presented below.
