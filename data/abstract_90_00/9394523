A strain of Schistosoma mansoni (R1) was isolated from patient previously submitted to four treatments with oxamniquine, and to another one with praziquantel. The results obtained with chemotherapeutic test, by using oxamniquine in mice infected with the strains R1 and LE (standard), showed an evident resistance to the drug in worms of the strain R1. Thus, at the dose of 250 mg/kg oxamniquine, all mice (17) infected with the LE strain did not show surviving worms, whereas 12 out of 17 mice infected with the R1 strain presented surviving worms. At the dose of 200 mg/kg, the LE strain showed recovery rates of 1.06% and 20.58%, whereas the R1 strain presented 18.57% and 61.14%, for male and female worms, respectively. At the dose of 100 mg/kg, the recovery of male worms was 2.6% for the LE strain, and 29.9% for the R1 strain. At the same dose, the recovery of females did not show statistically significant differences between the two strains (LE = 76.38%, R1 = 79.12%). Praziquantel showed similar antischistosomal activity against both studied strains, when administered at the dose of 500 mg/kg.
