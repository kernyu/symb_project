In a randomized controlled study of malaria prophylaxis, dapsone-pyrimethamine at a weekly dosage of dapsone 50-100 mg with pyrimethamine 6.25-12.5 mg or placebo was administered to 166 school children for 17 weeks. Fortnightly parasitological controls revealed 28 infections in the placebo group and none in the dapsone-pyrimethamine group. It is concluded that weekly dapsone-pyrimethamine is effective for the prophylaxis of falciparum malaria in Mozambique.
