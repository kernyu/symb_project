From January 1988 to November 1992, 107 (3.5%) of 3074 postneonatal children admitted to the Children's Emergency Room, University of Maiduguri Teaching Hospital, Nigeria, had sporadic pyogenic meningitis; 66 (61.7%) were aged < or = 12 months. Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis and Haemophilus influenzae together were responsible for 77.3% (58) of 75 culture-proven cases, 13.4% (10) had Enterobacteriaceae, 5.3% (4) had Staphylococcus aureus and 4% (3) untyped alpha-haemolytic streptococci. Fifty percent of 62 bacteria were resistant to ampicillin, 47.2% of 36 to penicillin and 10.7% of 56 to chloramphenicol; none of 21 bacteria was simultaneously resistant to all three antibiotics. Up until 1992, we have encountered treatment failure with a regimen containing chloramphenicol in only 2 of 53 patients; the 2 patients had coliform meningitis. Non-meningococcal bacteria are an important cause of sporadic pyogenic meningitis in sub-Saharan Nigeria and chloramphenicol is the most appropriate initial drug of choice at the present time for the management of sporadic meningitis.
