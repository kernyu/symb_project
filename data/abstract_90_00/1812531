A study was made on 198 Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains isolated at a pediatric intensive care unit from January to August 1988, using pyocin typing and antibiotic typing as markers. The most frequent circulating pyocin types were 31.83 and atypical 23578. The germ showed high resistance in vitro to the antimicrobial drugs used and the resistance patterns were distributed in 19 different antibiotic types.
