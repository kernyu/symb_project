BACKGROUND: Use of antibiotics for acute respiratory infection (ARI) of presumed viral etiology is a worldwide problem. The World Health Organization (WHO) has provided guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of ARI for developing countries. METHODS: Specially trained observers applied the WHO criteria to study the diagnosis and treatment of ARI given by 100 randomly selected health care workers (HCWs) in a rural county in China. A total of 750 cases of ARI were evaluated. RESULTS: Before the parents sought medical care, 47% of children in the county hospitals, 25% of those in the townships and 18% of those in the villages had already received antibiotics, available without prescription. Among the HCWs antibiotic abuse (antibiotics for presumably viral disease) was detected in the treatment of 97% of cases, and severe abuse (such as prescription of two incompatible antibiotics) was detected in 37%. Most (197 of 200) patients with bacterial disease received antibiotics, but inappropriate antibiotic treatment (dose or type) was observed in 63% of these cases. HCWs with university training and those with higher test scores on knowledge and attitude prescribed antibiotics more judiciously than those lacking those attributes. CONCLUSIONS: Abuse of antibiotics for ARI is a serious and costly problem in rural China, potentially leading to widespread antibiotic resistance. Educating HCWs in the management of ARI and proper use of antibiotics has high priority in China.
