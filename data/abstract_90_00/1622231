New strains with enhanced resistance to monensin were developed from Prevotella (Bacteroides) ruminicola subsp. ruminicola 23 and P. ruminicola subsp. brevis GA33 by stepwise exposure to increasing concentrations of monensin. The resulting resistant strains (23MR2 and GA33MR) could initiate growth in concentrations of monensin which were 4 to 40 times greater than those which inhibited the parental strains. Resistant strains also showed enhanced resistance to nigericin and combinations of monensin and nigericin but retained sensitivity to lasalocid. Glucose utilization in cultures of the monensin-sensitive strains (23 and GA33) and one monensin-resistant strain (23MR2) was retarded but not completely inhibited when logarithmic cultures were challenged with monensin (10 mg/liter). Monensin challenge of cultures of the two monensin-sensitive strains (23 and GA33) was characterized by 78 and 51% decreases in protein yield (milligrams of protein per mole of glucose utilized), respectively. Protein yields in cultures of resistant strain 23MR2 were decreased by only 21% following monensin challenge. Cell yields and rates of glucose utilization by resistant strains GA33MR were not decreased by challenge with 10 mg of monensin per liter. Resistant strains produced greater relative proportions of propionate and less acetate than the corresponding sensitive strains. The relative amounts of succinate produced were greater in cultures of strains 23, GA33, and 23MR2 following monensin challenge. However, only minor changes in end product formation were associate with monensin challenge of resistant strain GA33MR. These results suggest that monensin has significant effects on both the growth characteristics and metabolic activities of these predominant, gram-negative ruminal bacteria.
