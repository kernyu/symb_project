This document includes the recommendations from the Spanish antibiogram committee (The MENSURA group, Mesa Espanola de Normalizacion de la Sensibilidad y Resistencia a los Antimicrobianos, under the auspices of the Sociedad Espanola de Quimioterapia and Sociedad Espanola de Enfermedades Infecciosas y Microbiologia Clinica) for the selection of antimicrobials for susceptibility testing. Separate tables for each group of organism with proposed susceptibility and resistance breakpoints are updated and comparatively presented with those of other groups, such us NCCLS, CA-SFM and BSAC. The susceptibility breakpoint tends to identify the fully susceptible population, which probably lacks any specific resistance mechanism. The analysis of MIC distributions for different homogeneous populations (same species) is used to define breakpoints for susceptibility. The resistance breakpoint is based on pharmacological and clinical data obtained when the corresponding antibiotic is administered with a conventional schedule. The primary objective of the Spanish MENSURA group is to contribute to the international consensus on the establishment of breakpoints.
