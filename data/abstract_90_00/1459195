Several studies have shown that expression of exogenous wild-type p53 is detrimental to the growth of cell lines with absent or mutant p53. In this study, wild-type p53 cDNA expression plasmids were transfected into A549 lung carcinoma cells which had previously been shown by sequencing to contain wild-type p53. When a constitutively expressed wild-type p53 plasmid containing the neomycin resistance gene was transfected into these cells, no G418-resistant colonies contained the exogenous p53 cDNA even though the neomycin resistance gene was integrated. When cells were transfected with a dexamethasone-inducible wild-type p53 cDNA expression plasmid, induction of p53 expression resulted in a decreased growth rate and a decreased proportion of S-phase cells. Continuous treatment with dexamethasone resulted in continued p53 expression for 16 days, but beyond that time expression ceased and could not be reinduced. These data indicated that although the A549 cell line could proliferate in the presence of endogenous wild-type p53 there was a strong selection pressure against continued expression of additional exogenous wild-type p53.
