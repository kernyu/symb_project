Over 10,000 research scientists attended the ICAAC meeting in Toronto, Canada. The continued increase in the rate of resistance in bacteria and fungi and the underlying mechanisms of resistance were the focus of many presentations this year. So, too, were the attempts to combat this emerging resistance crisis. Many papers described new modifications to older antimicrobials, novel classes of antimicrobials and the potential use of new antibacterial and antifungal targets.
