Binding affinity of penicillin-binding proteins (PBP) of Staphylococcus aureus for several beta-lactam antibiotics was examined in a methicillin-susceptible strain and in two methicillin-resistant strains, one heterogeneous and one homogeneous, to determine relationships between PBP binding and expression of resistance. PBPs 1-4 had similar affinities in all three strains. PBP 2a affinities were similar in both resistant strains. For the susceptible strain and for the susceptible subpopulation of cells in the heterogeneous strain, growth inhibition correlated with binding to PBPs 1-3, suggesting that these PBPs mediate susceptibility in both. For resistant cells, growth inhibition correlated only with binding to PBP 2a, suggesting that this is the target in resistant cells. Determination of binding affinity for PBP 2a or the concentration that inhibits growth of the most resistant subpopulation of cells should be included in evaluation of beta-lactam antibiotics for potential activity against methicillin-resistant strains of S. aureus.
