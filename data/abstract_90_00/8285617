The activities of antituberculosis agents were evaluated in a murine tuberculosis model using a drug-resistant isolate. A multidrug-resistant clinical isolate from a recent outbreak of tuberculosis in the New York State correctional system was used for infection. Approximately 10(7) viable Mycobacterium tuberculosis ATCC 49967 (strain CNL) organisms were given intravenously to 4-week-old female outbred mice. Treatment was started 1 day after infection and given for 4 weeks. Spleens and lungs were homogenized, and viable cell counts were determined. Statistical analysis indicated that ethionamide, sparfloxacin, ofloxacin, capreomycin, clarithromycin, and clofazimine are active in the murine test system with this multidrug-resistant tuberculosis isolate. Sparfloxacin is the most active quinolone. Despite in vitro resistance, isoniazid has moderate activity. In vitro susceptibility data coupled with evaluation of agents against drug-resistant isolates in the murine system should provide information necessary to design clinical trials for treatment of infections with these organisms.
