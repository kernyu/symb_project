The efficacy of single administration of NY-198 in the treatment of gonococcal infections was studied employing male patients with gonorrheal urethritis and female patients with gonorrheal cervicitis. The clinical efficacy was evaluated on the basis of the efficacy rates which was estimated on each observation day for each patient. In the male patients, NY-198 was administered in a dose of 200 mg in 25 cases and a dose of 400 mg in 65 cases. The rate of eradication of N. gonorrhoeae (i.e. efficacy) on the 3rd day of administration was 96% in the 200 mg administration group and 100% in the 400 mg administration group. On the 7th day after administration, the eradication rate was 100% in both the 200 mg and 400 mg administration groups. When the eradication rate on the 7th day was statistically estimated for patients who returned to the hospital only on the 3rd day, it was 97.9% in the 200 mg administration group. In the female patients, NY-198 was administered in a dose of 200 mg to 4 cases and a dose of 400 mg to 5 cases. The eradication rate on each observation day was 100% in both dosage groups. In conclusion, single administration of NY-198 in a dose of 200 mg or 400 mg was highly effective, and considered to be a therapeutic method highly useful clinically.
