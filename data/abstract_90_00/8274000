We isolated three nikkomycin-resistant mutants of the dimorphic fungus M. rouxii which were physiologically characterized regarding their response to yeast-phase inducing conditions and their sensitivity to bacilysin. Mutant strains G21 and G23, showed a qualitatively normal, though delayed, dimorphic transition and partial cross-resistance to bacilysin. Mutant strain G27 showed an altered dimorphism, producing a high proportion (50%) of hyphal cells, and a wild-type sensitivity to bacilysin. Cell-free extracts from this mutant exhibited an activity of both basal and protease-activated chitin synthetase which was overexpressed as compared with the parental strain and mutants G21 and G23. Results are discussed in terms of the different genetic background of the mutants.
