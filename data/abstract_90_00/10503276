Yersinia enterocolitica has been described as expressing two types of chromosomal beta-lactamase, the broad spectrum enzyme A and the inducible cephalosporinase enzyme B. Nevertheless, not all Y. enterocolitica strains express both enzyme A and enzyme B; Y. enterocolitica strains of the less commonly isolated biotype 2, serotype O:5 (27) lack the enzyme A. Also, no other members of the Enterobacteriaceae have been demonstrated to produce enzyme A. Detection of this enzyme could therefore be a useful laboratory tool in distinguishing common pathogenic strains of Y. enterocolitica from other Enterobacteriaceae. A simple test by disc diffusion on agar for the recognition of enzyme A expression in Y. enterocolitica was evaluated. The test was based on the resistance to ticarcillin conferred by enzyme A and the highly effective inhibition of this enzyme by clavulanic acid. A typical additional zone of inhibition between the zones of inhibition around a ticarcillin 75 micrograms disc and an amoxycillin/clavulanate 3 micrograms disc was indicative of the presence of enzyme A. By contrast, a large zone of inhibition around the ticarcillin disc without an additional zone of inhibition, reflected the absence of enzyme A.
