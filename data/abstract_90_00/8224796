The lacticin 481-producer (Lct+), L. lactis subsp. lactis (L. lactis) CNRZ 481 harbours 5 plasmids of 6.5, 7.5, 20, 37 and 69 kb. Novobiocin treatment of L. lactis 481 led to the appearance of lacticin 481 deficient variants which had all lost the 69 kb plasmid. Conjugal transfer of the lacticin 481 structural gene (lct) into the plasmid free strain L. lactis IL1441 yielded Lct+ transconjugants at a 10(-4) frequency, which carried a plasmid with an apparent size of 120-130 kb. Southern hybridization analyses showed that the lct gene was located on the 69 kb plasmid in L. lactis 481 and on the 120-130 kb plasmid in the transconjugants. The lct gene was in higher copy number in transconjugants than in the parental strain resulting in two-fold higher lacticin 481 production in the former strain.
