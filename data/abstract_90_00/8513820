The killing kinetics of cefuroxime against 25 Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates with penicillin MICs of < 0.1, 0.1-1.0 and 2 mg/l were studied in an in vitro model simulating the serum concentration profile in healthy adults following a single intramuscular injection of 500 mg. Cefuroxime was bactericidal against the isolates with exquisite or slightly diminished susceptibility to penicillin (-4 and -3.9 log10 cfu/ml killing, respectively) during the 6 h incubation period. In contrast, there was only a 2.8 log10 cfu/ml reduction in the initial inoculum of six of the eight isolates resistant to penicillin (MIC 2 mg/l). The two remaining penicillin-resistant isolates (cefuroxime MIC 8 mg/l) only showed a 2 log10 cfu reduction in the initial inoculum.
