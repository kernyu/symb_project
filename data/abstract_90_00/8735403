Otitis media with effusion (OME) is a common condition in paediatric ENT practice. Whilst surgical management is in many cases the mainstay of treatment for resistant OME, the use of antibiotics has been advocated by some authorities. Over one quarter of middle ear effusions analysed in this study contained potentially pathogenic bacteria. Antibiotics may be of value in the treatment of OME in these children.
