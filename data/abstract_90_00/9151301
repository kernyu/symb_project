Treatment of animals with big endothelin-1 (bET) causes pulmonary hypertension and bronchoconstriction, both in vivo and in perfused lungs. The biological activity of bET requires proteolytic cleavage to ET-1 by endothelin converting enzymes (ECE) and possibly other proteases such as neutral endopeptidase 24.11 (NEP 24.11). Since the role of NEP 24.11 in the physiological activation of bET is unclear, we investigated the effects of the selective NEP 24.11 inhibitor thiorphan on bET-induced vaso- and bronchoconstriction in the isolated perfused rat lung. We also studied the effects of phosphoramidon and (S)-2-biphenyl-4-yl-1-(1H-tetraol-5-yl)-ehtylaminomethylphosphonic acid (CGS-26303), i.e. agents which block not only NEP 24.11 but also ECE. The bET-induced vasoconstriction was much less prominent than the bronchoconstriction, i.e. after exposure for 110 min vascular and airway conductance were decreased by 33% and 80% respectively. The small bET-induced vasoconstriction was attenuated to a similar degree by pretreatment with any of the three protease inhibitors. However, thiorphan up to a concentration of 10 microM had only little effect on the bET-induced bronchoconstriction, while 10 microM phosphoramidon or CGS-26303 provided half-maximal and 100 microM phosphoramidon complete protection in this model. This profile of inhibitor action suggests that in rat lung ECE is the major enzyme responsible for activation of bET.
