111 neonates with acute respiratory insufficiency and/or severe pneumopathy (pneumonia, bronchopneumonia) occurring in the first 10 hours after birth were investigated during January 1990-September 1991 for the group B streptococci presence. 430 samples from these neonate cases: throat and nose exudates, necroptic material from died neonates (pulmonary, blood, bronchial secretion) and their mothers (lochia, vaginal and uterine secretion) were examined. 33% of the neonates and their mothers were positive with the same GBS. 65.30% from the GBS strains belonged to serotype Ia and 34.70% to Ib. 24.48% from the GBS strains were resistant to Penicillin G by diffusimetric method with a corresponding MIC of 0.1 UP/ml (22.12%) and 0.5 UP/ml (2.65%).
