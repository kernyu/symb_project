The outcome of a department of pharmacy-initiated "streamlining" study designed to promote cost-conscious modifications of empirically selected antibiotic therapy is described. Two hundred forty-one evaluable adult patients started on restricted-use antibiotics at this university-affiliated community private teaching hospital were enrolled in a 9-week prospective streamlining study. Patients were alternately assigned to a Control (i.e., no pharmacist-initiated streamlining recommendations offered based on culture and susceptibility reports) or a Pharmacist Intervention group (i.e., pharmacist offers recommendations to streamline therapy). A statistically significant greater number of patients had their empiric antibiotic treatment courses modified to more appropriate antibiotic choices after receipt of culture and susceptibility reports among private prescribers in the Pharmacist Intervention group (83%) than in the Control group (38%) (p = .006). Additionally, pharmacists were overall successful in gaining prescriber acceptance for 64% of recommended changes of empiric antibiotic treatment courses before the receipt of culture and susceptibility reports (e.g., dose and/or frequency changes). There was no program effect observed with respect to improved physician response to microbiologic data that would allow streamlining empirical antibiotic choices in the Housestaff (i.e., medical or surgical residents), or infectious disease consultant prescriber groups. Projected overall annual cost savings that would be achieved as a result of continued efforts by pharmacists directed at streamlining empirical "restricted" antibiotic regimens is approximately +40,000.
