We evaluated the effect of coculture of virulent and avirulent strains of Mycoplasma pulmonis with mononuclear cells from resistant and susceptible strains of mice on natural killer (NK) cell activity against YAC-1 cells in a standard 4-h 51Cr-release assay. Endogenous NK activity was minimal in the specific-pathogen-free-mice without an external stimulus. There was no correlation between in vivo virulence of the mycoplasmas or host resistance and the in vitro stimulation of NK cell activity. Only two of the avirulent strains of M. pulmonis tested induced significant increases in NK cell activity, and virulent M. pulmonis increased activity only in cells from susceptible C3H/HeN mice.
