To clone the mammalian gene(s) associated with a novel lipophilic antifolate resistance provoked by the antiparasitic drug pyrimethamine (Assaraf, Y. G., and Slotky, J. I. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 4556-4566), differential screening of a cDNA library from pyrimethamine-resistant (PyrR100) cells was used. This library was screened with total cDNA from wild-type and PyrR100 cells. Surprisingly, several differentially overexpressed cDNA clones were isolated from PyrR100 cells, many of which mapped to the mitochondrial genome. Several lines of evidence establish mitochondria as a new target for the cytotoxic activity of pyrimethamine. (a) At > or = 10 microM, pyrimethamine inhibited mitochondrial respiration in viable wild-type cells. (b) Electron microscopy revealed degenerated mitochondrial membrane cristae in PyrR100 cells. (c) Some mitochondrially encoded transcripts were prominently elevated, whereas the normally stable 12 S/16 S rRNA was decreased in PyrR100 cells. (d) Metabolic pulse-chase labeling suggested an increased turnover rate of mitochondrially synthesized proteins in PyrR100 cells. (e) The specific activity of the key respiratory enzymatic complex cytochrome c oxidase was reduced by 6-fold in PyrR100 cells. (f) Consequently, the rate of respiration in intact PyrR100 cells was reduced by 3-fold. We conclude that pyrimethamine and possibly lipophilic analogues of methotrexate possess a folinic acid nonrescuable toxicity involving disruption of mitochondrial inner membrane structure and respiratory function, thereby establishing a new organellar target for the cytotoxic effect elicited by lipid-soluble antifolates.
