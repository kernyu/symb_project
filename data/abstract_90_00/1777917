Long-term ingestion of sublethal n-butanol doses by rats led to a noteworthy increase in the resistance of in vitro brain ribosomal function to the acute inhibitory action of ethanol and isopropanol. Withdrawal of n-butanol did not change this adaptation process immediately. The step affected seems to be the elongation of polypeptide chains. The dependence of in vitro translation on incubation temperature was affected by the adaptation process, the translation system of chronic animals being less stimulatable than that of control animals at low temperature.
