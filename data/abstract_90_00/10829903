Six hundred and eighty five blood cultures from children clinically diagnosed as enteric fever yielded 176 salmonella strains showing isolation success rate of 25.7%, S. typhi were 164 (93.2%), S. paratyphi A 5 (2.8%), S. choleraesuis 4 (2.3%) and S. typhimurium 3 (1.7%). Antibiogram of 164 isolates of S. typhi showed triple drug resistance (TDR) in 156 strains (95.1%) to chloramphenicol, ampicillin and cotrimoxazole, and sensitivity of 90.2% and 95.1% to norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin respectively. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of chloramphenicol were between 360 mcg and 640 mcg per ml. Phage types of 38 strains of TDR S. typhi were predominantly E1 and 0 with prevalences of 47.4% and 36.8% respectively in this region. All children with S. typhi isolates sensitive to quinolones in Vitro responded well to these drugs with almost no relapse and hence, the newer generation of quinolones could be considered as the first choice in the primary treatment of enteric fever.
