P388 murine leukemic cells 28.6-fold resistant to vincristine were cross-resistant to doxorubicin and etoposide. Although the intracellular ara-CTP in P388 murine leukemic cells resistant to vincristine (P388/VCR) was significantly higher than that in the parent cells, the cytotoxic effect of ara-C was not significantly different between the parent and resistant cells. Therefore, we investigated the DNA synthesis in P388/VCR and its parent cell line using the permeable cell system. The DNA synthesis in P388/VCR cells was less sensitive to ara-CTP and dTTP than that in P388 parent cells. These results suggested that the characteristics of DNA polymerase in P388/VCR cells might change when the cells developed multiple drug resistance.
