A suppression of bacterial growth of three Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains after 30 min treatment with imipenem at supra-inhibitory concentrations (post-antibiotic effect; PAE) was observed. Imipenem (4x MIC) showed PAEs in the range of 0.5-0.9 h for stains studied. The PAEs manifested by imipenem at 8x MIC concentration varied between 2.4 and 4.0 h. Supra-inhibitory concentrations of imipenem did not affect the profiles of the outer membrane proteins of the stains. The treated strains revealed the same protein bands (45, 38, 35 and 23 kD) compared with controls.
