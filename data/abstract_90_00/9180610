We report here two cases of Saudi patients who acquired chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium falciparum locally, without any history of foreign travel, blood transfusion, or drug abuse. Both were satisfactorily treated, the first with quinine and a pyrimethamine-sulfadoxine combination, and the other with quinine and tetracycline. These two cases suggest either the possible establishment of chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum in Saudi Arabia, or the beginning of the spread of resistant strains from countries with established resistance to this country. Diligent notification of cases by attending physicians to the Ministry of Health will help to achieve effective control.
