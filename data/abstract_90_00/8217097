Herpes virus infections are responsible for morbidity and mortality among immunosuppressed patients. During the last decade substantial advances have been achieved through improvement of diagnostic techniques, development of effective antiviral agents and the use of different strategies for prophylaxis and treatment. Cytomegalovirus infection and disease can today be prevented and treated effectively; however, antiviral resistance is beginning to emerge as a potential major clinical problem. Similarly, infections with herpes simplex virus and varicella-zoster virus can be effectively treated, but antiviral resistance has also emerged for these viruses. Two new herpes viruses, human herpes viruses 6 and 7, have been discovered, and it is possible that these viruses can also cause significant problems in immunosuppressed individuals. New antiviral agents will be needed during the next decade to allow further advances in the treatment of herpes virus infections.
