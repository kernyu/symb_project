Twenty-two extended-spectrum betalactamase-producing strains of enterobacteriaceae recovered in the authors' hospital were tested using the Rapid ATB E coupled with the API V2.1.1. expert system. The expert system detected 90.9% of ESBL-producing strains. Two strains producing a SHV2 and a CTX1, respectively, escaped detection by the expert system despite concomitant resistance to aminoglycosides.
