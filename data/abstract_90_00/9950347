Six in vitro methods for the detection of anthelmintic resistance were compared using benzimidazole/levamisole-resistant Haemonchus contortus and benzimidazole/levamisole/ivermectin-resistant Ostertagia circumcincta as well as susceptible strains of both parasite species. The degree of resistance to thiabendazole and levamisole was compared by (1) an egg hatch assay, (2) an egg hatch paralysis assay, (3) a larval development assay, (4) a larval paralysis assay (5) a larval paralysis assay with physostigmine and (6) larval micromotility assay. The degree of resistance for each assay was expressed as resistance factor--RF. For the detection of thiabendazole and levamisole resistance, the larval development test was observed as the most sensitive to measure quantitatively a degree of resistance between susceptible and resistant strains. For this test the RF for thiabendazole and levamisole was 14.3 and >32.5, respectively in H. contortus strains and 21.1 and 3.5 in strains of O. circumcincta. Egg hatch assay was also found to be sensitive and accurate in determining of resistance to benzimidazole. For measurement of levamisole resistance the egg hatch paralysis assay and larval paralysis assay were found to be able to distinguish between strains, but some disadvantages of these techniques make it unsuitable for field detection of levamisole resistance. Other in vitro assays as larval paralysis assay with physostigmine and larval micromotility assay were also investigated. Significant differences in paralysis of the larvae were observed using larval paralysis assay.
