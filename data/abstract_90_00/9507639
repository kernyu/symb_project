Improvements in transformation techniques and the isolation of many genes whose transcripts or protein products either have antimicrobial or insecticidal activity or are involved in the synthesis of products with such activities have provided valuable tools for engineering resistance in plants. Future exploitation of this technology should provide an environmentally friendly alternative to traditional disease and pest control measures.
