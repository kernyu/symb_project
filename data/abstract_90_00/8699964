The effect of disinfectants on biofilm cells of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was evaluated. Eradication of biofilm cells of MRSA by chlorhexidine gluconate, benzalkonium chloride, alkyldiaminoethyl glycine and sodium hypochlorite required a much longer time than that of planktonic cells in suspensions. Benzalkonium chloride (0.1%) and alkyldiaminoethyl glycine (0.1%) were ineffective for eradication of biofilm cells even after 1 h, but were effective for eradication of planktonic cells within 20 s. Sodium hypochlorite (0.01%) was also ineffective for eradication of biofilm cells even after 30 min, but was lethal to planktonic cells within 20 s.
