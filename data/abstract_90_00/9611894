The authors investigated the effectiveness of 6 different disinfectants at recommended concentrations on strains of rare types of filamentous micromycetes: Scedosporium apiospermum and Exophiala dermatitidis (isolated from ophthalmomycoses), Fusarium dimerum (isolates from nosocomial fungaemia) and strains of Fusarium moniliforme and Stachybotrys alternans (isolates from the environment and potential producers of mycotoxins). The tested strains were mostly sensitive also to an alcoholic solution, to a preparation containing glutaraldehyde, with inorganic peroxocompounds, with peroxoacetic acid; the lowest effectiveness was found in the preparation containing active chlorine and the most resistant strain was Scedosporium apiospermum.
