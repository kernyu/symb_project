In order to know the sensitivity of Candida and Crytococcus to amphotericin B, main drug for the treatment od systemic mycosis, it was determined the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) in 90 clinical isolates of Candida and Crytococcus by a micromethod for the broth dilution. According to the results, Crytococcus neoformas was more sensitive then Candida albicans (geometrical means 0.24 and 0.41 respectively). Only one resistant strain was found (CMI = 16 micrograms/mL), corresponding to the Candida krusei species. The introduction of this technique in the Mycology Laboratory of the "Pedro Kouri" Institute of Tropical Medicine will allow to establish the sensitivity patterns and to detect the possible appearance of resistance in the main species of pathogenic fungus for men in our environment.
