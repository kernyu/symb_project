OBJECTIVE: To investigate the possibility of interhospital spread of multiresistant Staphylococcus aureus in Sao Paulo, Brazil. DESIGN: We evaluated 13 nosocomial S aureus strains selected because of resistance to oxacillin and ciprofloxacin. SETTING: The strains were collected between March 1991 and September 1991 from four different hospitals in Sao Paulo. Two were teaching hospitals, and two were private hospitals. PATIENTS: Each strain was isolated from a different patient. All patients were hospitalized when the strains were isolated. INTERVENTIONS: The strains were typed by restriction endonuclease analyses of plasmid DNA (REAP) using EcoRI, HindIII, RsaI, and AluI and by extended antibiogram profile (34 drugs). RESULTS: All strains had identical plasmid and antibiogram profile. They demonstrated the same plasmid pattern as previously described in one of the hospitals studied. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest the dissemination of a unique oxacillin- and quinolone-resistant strain of S aureus in several hospitals of Sao Paulo, Brazil.
