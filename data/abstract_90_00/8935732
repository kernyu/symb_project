Resistance to antimicrobial agents is an evolving process, driven by the selective pressure of heavy antibiotic use in individuals living in close proximity to others. The intensive care unit (ICU), crowded with debilitated patients who are receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics and being cared for by busy physicians, nurses, and technicians, serves as an ideal environment for the emergence of antibiotic resistance. Problem pathogens presently include multiply resistant gram-negative bacilli, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and the recently emerged vancomycin-resistant enterococci. The prevention of antimicrobial resistance in ICUs should focus on recognition via routine unit-based surveillance, improved compliance with handwashing and barrier precautions, and antibiotic-use policies tailored to individual units within hospitals.
