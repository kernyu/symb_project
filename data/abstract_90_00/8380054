Studies were performed to determine whether novobiocin can be used to enhance cisplatin (CDDP) cytotoxicity in a human small-cell lung carcinoma cell line, GLC4/CDDP, resistant to CDDP. Continuous incubation with novobiocin enhanced the cytotoxicity of CDDP treatment 1.9-fold in the parental cell line GLC4, but had no effect on its cytotoxicity in the resistant cell line GLC4/CDDP. Short incubation with novobiocin enhanced the cytotoxicity of CDDP treatment in GLC4 and GLC4/CDDP by a factor of 4.1 and 2.8, respectively. Using the latter schedule, the amount of CDDP-induced DNA interstrand cross-links (DNA ISC) at 4 hr as well as at 24 hr after novobiocin and CDDP treatment was higher in GLC4 than in GLC4/CDDP. In this case, the amount of DNA ISC had increased 1.6-fold in GLC4 and 1.3-fold in GLC4/CDDP at 4 hr, and 2.7-fold and 1.4-fold, respectively, in these cell lines at 24 hr after treatment compared to CDDP treatment alone. Our results suggest an effect of novobiocin on the formation of DNA ISC. The decreased efficacy of novobiocin, an inhibitor of DNA topoisomerase (Topo) II catalytic activity, in GLC4/CDDP may be due to the increased Topo II activity previously found in the resistant cells. In the present study, we showed that increased Topo II activity was not due to changes in amounts of Topo II in nuclei or nuclear extracts of GLC4/CDDP. Further analysis of the chromatin, that includes Topo II, showed that the chromatin in nuclei of GLC4/CDDP was more sensitive to micrococcal nuclease digestion than GLC4. In addition, the amount of a 56-kDa protein was increased 2-fold in nuclei and nuclear matrices from GLC4/CDDP. The reduced efficacy of novobiocin to increase the CDDP cytotoxicity as well as the formation of DNA ISC in GLC4/CDDP compared to GLC4 may be due to changes in the chromatin structure of the resistant cells.
