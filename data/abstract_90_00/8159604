We attempted to characterize the susceptibility of high-level, gentamicin-resistant (HLGR, minimum inhibitory concentration [MIC] > 2000 micrograms/ml) enterococcal blood isolates and evaluated a small subset of these isolates for bactericidal synergy. Thirteen Enterococcus faecalis and three Enterococcus faecium isolates that were HLGR were prospectively collected. Standard broth macrodilution techniques were used to determine the MICs and minimum bactericidal concentrations to a variety of antibiotics. Two isolates were evaluated for synergy by time-kill curve methods using combinations of penicillin and streptomycin, teicoplanin and rifampin, and vancomycin and ciprofloxacin. Teicoplanin was the most active antibiotic tested, with all isolates exhibiting susceptibility to this agent. Four E. faecalis isolates and one E. faecium isolate expressed only low-level resistance to streptomycin (LLSR, MICs 32-64 micrograms/ml). Penicillin and streptomycin produced bactericidal synergy in the LLSR isolate. The other antibiotic combinations did not result in bactericidal synergy in the two isolates tested. For HLGR enterococci that are only LLSR, the combination of penicillin-streptomycin appears to provide adequate bactericidal activity. Teicoplanin may potentially be useful for streptomycin-resistant HLGR isolates.
