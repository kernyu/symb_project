This paper discusses three observations of atypical forms of tuberculosis epiglottitis. In two patients, clinical manifestations were similar to abscess formation of acute epiglottitis and in one patient productive inflammation of the epiglottis and its ulceration resembled epiglottis carcinoma. In all the patients these were advanced pathologies that developed together with pulmonary tuberculosis. This indicates that ENT doctors must be very careful when treating patients with atypical epiglottis that shows resistance to anti-inflammatory therapy.
