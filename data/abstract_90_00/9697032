The adherence of P. aeruginosa to collagen membrane, sponge, and to a new anti-infective COLL dressing and the susceptibility of the organisms attached to the biomaterials to amikacin were investigated in vitro. After 17 h of attachment, the bacteria demonstrated an increased resistance to amikacin compared with their free-floating counterparts. Amikacin, even at a concentration exceeding 150 times the minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) for the strain tested, did not eradicate the attached bacteria from the surface of collagen membrane. However, when the drug at a high concentration (over 16 times the minimal inhibitory concentration, MIC) was present in the incubation medium before it had been inoculated with P. aeruginosa, a reduction of 2 log10 units in the organisms adherent to the surface of collagen membrane was observed. We conclude that slow release of the antibiotic from the COLL dressing could control the bacterial colonization on the surface. In fact, the released amikacin at the final concentration of 32 times the MBC reduced the number of adherent bacteria by 6 log10 units. In contrast, ciprofloxacin at the same final bactericidal concentration completely eradicated the bacteria from the surface of COLL dressing. However, as ciprofloxacin is not recommended for use as a topical antimicrobial agent, a further search is needed to find an agent with a similar anticolonization activity.
