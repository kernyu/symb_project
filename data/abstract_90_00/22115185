Microbial biofilms are notably recalcitrant towards treatment with antibiotics, biocides or disinfectants that would adequately control the same organisms growing in planktonic mode. Much of this resistance has been attributed to an organisation of the biofilm cells within exopolymer matrices. Whilst such exopolymers are unlikely to hinder the diffusion and access of antimicrobial agents to the underlying cells, they will chemically quench reactive biocides such as chlorine and peroxygens, and bind highly charged antibiotics, such as tobramycin and gentamycin, thereby providing some protection to the more deep lying cells. Extracellular enzymes, bound within the glycocalyx and able to degrade the treatment agents, will further reduce the access of susceptible compounds. Diffusion limitation however, is unlikely to be the sole moderator of the resistance properties of microbial biofilms. In addition, gradients of oxygen and nutrients established across the biofilm community will cause growth rates to be much reduced at points remoted from the accessible nutrient. Slow growth rates, and the associated induction of stringent responses further contribute towards this resistance. Finally, there have been recent demonstrations that attachment of microorganisms to surfaces promotes the expression of genes that are not normally expressed in planktonic culture. Whether or not the expression of such genes alters the phenotype in a manner which alters the response of the cells to antimicrobial agents remains to be demonstrated.
