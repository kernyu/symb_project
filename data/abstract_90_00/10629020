Syn 2190, a 1,5 dihydroxy-4-pyridon monobactam inhibitor of AmpC enzymes, was tested against beta-lactamase-producing bacteria with piperacillin, piperacillin-tazobactam and ceftazidime as partner drugs. In the presence of conalbumin as an iron chelator, Syn 2190 potentiated these drugs against most AmpC producers, although Klebsiella spp. with plasmidic AmpC enzymes were an exception. Potentiation was much weaker without conalbumin, suggesting that Syn 2190 exploits a ferric uptake pathway, as do catecholic cephalosporins. Syn 2190 had little ability to potentiate partner drugs against strains with other beta-lactamase types but, with conalbumin, increased the activity of piperacillin-tazobactam against Escherichia coli transconjugants producing various class A or D enzymes.
