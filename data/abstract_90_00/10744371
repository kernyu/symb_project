Seventeen multiple-antibiotic-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates were collected from two patients hospitalized in the same intensive care unit. They showed a parallel acquisition of resistance to antibiotics and they were, therefore, thought to have a common clonal origin. These strains were typed by biotyping, serotyping, plasmid profile, three different PCR-based techniques, and macrorestriction analysis to determine their relationship. Only the use of PCR techniques and macrorestriction analysis allowed an accurate identification of the clones and revealed that each patient was infected by A unique multidrug-resistant strain. Therefore, there was no cross-infection or reinfection with a new strain.
