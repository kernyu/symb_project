To investigate the potential use of E. coli cytosine deaminase (CD) gene instead of the commonly used HSV-TK gene in the gene therapy of brain tumors, we constructed a retrovirus vector carrying the CD gene. We then transduced a rat glioma cell line C6 with CD gene by the retrovirus vector. Transduction of the CD gene made C6 cells become highly sensitive to the anti-fungi drug 5-fluorocytosine (5FC). IC50 for 5FC was 6,000 microM in CD-negative cells, while it was 3 microM in CD-positive cells. Mixed cellular assay showed that CD-positive cells had a strong "bystander effect" on CD-negative cells when exposed to 5FC. Significant anti-tumor effects were observed in nude mice bearing s.c. tumors derived from CD-positive cells when these animals were given 250 mg/kg 5FC twice a day for 20 consecutive days. A marked decrease in tumor weight occurred when a mixture containing 50% CD-positive and 50% CD-negative C6 cells was injected s.c., followed by 5FC treatment, suggesting the bystander effect in vivo. Concerning the pharmacokinetics of 5FC, especially its high oral bio-availability and good penetration into cerebrospinal fluid, we suppose that the combination of CD-gene transfer and 5FC oral administration may have potential use in the gene therapy of brain tumors.
