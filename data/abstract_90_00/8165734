Two cases of relapsing malaria infection by Plasmodium vivax from Guatemala are presented in patients treated with current standard doses of chloroquine and primaquine. The difficulties in recognizing resistance to chloroquine versus poor response to standard primaquine schedules are discussed. The recent recommendations of adopting a schedule of 6 mg/kg as a total dose of primaquine proved in our cases to be effective in obtaining a radical cure of the infection.
