Recent trends in the development of resistance of the Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae to antibiotics were investigated, using a questionnaire delivered to participants at a meeting of the Kinki District Society of Infections. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) accounted for 55.4% of all isolated S. aureus, and more than 80% of MRSA was detected within hospitals. In outpatients, MRSA was often detected in pus, while in hospitalized patients, MRSA was often detected in sputum. Further, MRSA was accompanied by some other organisms (most frequently Pseudomonas aeruginosa) in 64.7% of MRSA positive patients. The sensitivity of MRSA to vancomycin (VCM) was 100%, to sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (ST) 99.2%, and to arbekacin, 98.6%. In contrast, Penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (PRSP) accounted for 42.4% of all isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae. About 50% of PRSP was detected in out-patients. For both hospitalized patients and outpatients, PRSP was most frequently detected in sputum. PRSP was accompanied by some other organisms (most frequently Haemophilus influenzae) in 49.3% of PRSP positive patients, PRSP had high sensitivity to cephems, carbapenems and VCM.
