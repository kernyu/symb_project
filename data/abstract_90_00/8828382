A 71-year-old woman with active aortic prosthetic endocarditis due to Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE) and subannular mycotic aneurysm and paravalvular leakage and acute mitral regurgitation underwent emergent surgical treatment. The mycotic aneurysm was closed using a prosthetic patch after surgical debridement. Re-aortic valve replacement with a 21-mm Hancock II prosthesis was performed at the paraannular position by utilizing the patch. Mitral valve was also replaced with a 27-mm Hancock II prosthesis. Antibiotic therapy was provided by vancomycin combined with rifampicin and gentamicin. The following regimen was given, vancomycin 1 g i.v. q12h for 6 weeks plus gentamicin 80 mg/day i.v. for 4 weeks plus rifampicin 450 mg/day orally for 6 weeks. Vancomycin and gentamicin doses were modified appropriately according to the monitored serum levels in the patient with renal failure. Postoperative course was uneventful. The patient is doing well 11 months after surgery and no recurrence of infection has been seen. We conclude that prompt surgical removal of the infected sources and appropriate antibiotic therapy based on the bacteriology may be the only curative treatment for uncontrolled infection at the active phase of MRSE prosthetic endocarditis.
