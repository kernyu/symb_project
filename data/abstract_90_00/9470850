Hexadecylphosphocholine (HePC) is a new etherphospholipid derived substance with pronounced antineoplastic activity. So far the mode of action of this compound has not been resolved. Therefore, we decided to approach this problem by generating HePC resistant sublines of susceptible cells. The human leukaemia cell line HL 60 was successfully adapted to high concentrations of HePC over a period of 14 months. The resistant cell line HL 60 R shows similar functional characteristics as the original HL 60. Both lines can be induced to terminal differentiation into a granulocytic phenotype by DMSO. In this process, normal HL 60 cells also become resistant towards HePC. Determinations of cellular membrane lipid composition did not show significant changes, which would explain the resistance mechanism. Analysis of cellular proteins by 2D-gelelectrophoresis revealed two 50 kDa proteins expressed in HL 60 and differentiated HL 60 cells, which were not expressed in HL 60 R. Reversion of resistance of HL 60 R after prolonged cultivation without HePC led to re-expression of the two proteins, indicating at a possible involvement of these proteins in HePC sensitivity.
