Erythromycin and other macrolides have enjoyed a renaissance in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s secondary to the discovery of "new' pathogens such as Chlamydia, Legionella, Campylobacter and Mycoplasma spp. Erythromycin is an important therapeutic agent in the paediatric age group for several reasons: (a) it exhibits proven efficacy for a wide range of infections (upper and lower respiratory tract infections, skin/skin structure infections, prophylaxis of endocarditis/acute rheumatic fever/ophthalmia neonatorum and pre-colonic surgery, campylobacteriosis, chlamydial and ureaplasmal infections, diphtheria, whooping cough, streptococcal pharyngitis) and gastrointestinal (GI) dysmotility states; (b) intravenous formulations are widely available; and (c) it is available in a number of formulations as a generic product, which is likely to result in significant cost savings. Nevertheless, erythromycin and similar earlier macrolides are characterised by a number of drawbacks including a narrow spectrum of antimicrobial activity, unfavourable pharmacokinetic properties and poor GI tolerability. Newer macrolides such as clarithromycin and azithromycin are useful in serving the needs of paediatric patients who are erythromycin-intolerant or who have infections caused by organisms that are intrinsically erythromycin-resistant, or for which a high percentage of strains are resistant (e.g. Haemophilus influenzae, Helicobacter pylori, Mycobacterium avium complex). In addition, these newer macrolides may be considered as alternatives to oral amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, second or third generation cephalosporins, or erythromycin plus sulphonamide in this patient population. Selection between specific macrolides and between macrolides and other antibiotics in the paediatric population is likely to depend, at least for the immediate future, on separate comparisons of product availability, cost, effectiveness and tolerability profiles.
