A total of 114 gram-negative fecal isolates from domestic pigs in herds with different histories of antimicrobial agent exposure were screened for the presence of plasmid DNA and specific tetracycline resistance determinants. More than 84% of the isolates harbored plasmid DNA, which ranged in size from 2.1 to 186 kb. A total of 78 isolates (68.4%) were resistant to tetracycline at concentrations greater than 4 micrograms/ml. Plasmid DNAs from about 56% of the tetracycline-resistant isolates hybridized with DNA probes for class A, B, C, and D tetracycline resistance determinants. The class B determinant was the most common determinant (35% of the isolates), followed by the class C determinant (12%) and the class A determinant (1%). About 9% of the isolates contained two determinants on plasmids. None of the plasmids from isolates hybridized with the class D determinant probe. The class C determinant was the most prevalent determinant on plasmids in isolates from pigs not exposed to antimicrobial agents for more than 146 months, while the class B determinant was more prevalent on plasmids in isolates from pigs exposed to either subtherapeutic or therapeutic levels of antimicrobial agents. Most tetracycline resistance determinants were localized on plasmids which were more than 30 kb long. A great number of wild-type tetracycline-resistant Escherichia coli strains were found with the class E determinant on their chromosomes. This study revealed a high prevalence of tetracycline resistance determinants in the fecal flora of pig herds whether or not they were fed with antibiotics.
