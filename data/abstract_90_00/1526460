Tetracycline resistance in Mycoplasma hominis and Ureaplasma urealyticum has been associated with the tetM determinant and has recently been increasing in incidence. We report here a rapid method for detection of the tetM determinant based on the use of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to amplify a 397-bp DNA fragment from the tetM gene and verification of specificity using the restriction enzyme TaqI. Analysis of 42 U. urealyticum and 49 M. hominis isolates indicates that the PCR method may be clinically useful for determination of tetracycline sensitivity, as tetM is presently the only known determinant associated with tetracycline resistance in these two organisms. All of the tetM-positive M. hominis isolates were sensitive to doxycycline, indicating that tetM does not necessarily confer resistance to this antibiotic.
