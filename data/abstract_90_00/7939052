The susceptibility of 2196 fresh clinical isolates to twelve different oral compounds was assessed in five Swiss microbiology institutions during summer 1992. A standardized microdilution system including all other material necessary was employed to assess the antibacterial activity of penicillin G, ampicillin, ampicillin + sulbactam, amoxycillin + clavulanic acid, cefadroxil, cephalexin, cefaclor, cefuroxime, cefetamet, doxycycline, erythromycin and clindamycin. The aminopenicillins (including the beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations) were highly active against the streptococci, in combination with a beta-lactamase inhibitor they covered the majority of the bla+ E. coli and Proteus mirabilis and between 60 to 80% of the Klebsiella spp. and Proteus vulgaris isolates. All the cephalosporins exhibited good activity against the streptococci, they were active against Gram-negative fermentative rods to a varying degree. Cefetamet was also active against many cefaclor and cefuroxime-resistant isolates. A considerable part of the species studied exhibited resistance to doxycycline; the observed resistance of S. agalactia, P. mirabilis, and Morganella morganii agreed with previous findings. Most of the Streptococcus spp. were inhibited by erythromycin and clindamycin. There were only single penicillin resistant S. pneumoniae isolates in the five Swiss centers. Taking account of the above particulars the epidemiology of antimicrobial resistance in Switzerland can be considered satisfactory.
