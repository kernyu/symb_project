The susceptibilities of 50 unique vancomycin-susceptible (n = 15) and vancomycin-resistant (n = 35) enterococci to 6 antimicrobials were compared. Teicoplanin was consistently the most active agent for all strains. Ampicillin and imipenem were active primarily for vancomycin-sensitive Enterococcus faecalis. Clinafloxacin and ciprofloxacin showed poorer activity compared to prior studies, suggesting that the emergence of quinolone resistance is now occurring in enterococci.
