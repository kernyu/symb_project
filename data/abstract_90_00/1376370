Interferon (IFN)-stimulated gene factor 2 (ISGF2) plays a role in transcription of the beta IFN (IFN-beta) gene and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) and may function as a central mediator of cytokine responses. Constitutive ISGF2 transgene expression resulted in substantial resistance to three RNA virus families. This phenotype was not a consequence of IFN production and may have arisen directly through ISG expression. ISGF2 acted generally as a positive transcription factor through binding sites from several genes, in the context of transient cotransfection. Constitutive transcription of the endogenous IFN-beta gene, and several genes that are normally induced by either IFN-alpha or IFN-gamma, or only by IFN-alpha, was elevated in cells that constitutively express an ISGF2 transgene. However, constitutive and virus-induced levels of IFN-beta mRNA were unaffected in such cell lines.
