Fifty children in the first decade of life, and suffering from multiple drug resistant kala-azar, confirmed by demonstration of amastigotes in aspirates of bone marrow or spleen were treated with amphotericin B in gradually increasing dosage to a total dose of 20 mg/kg. All patients had classical features of severe kala-azar, and had taken more than one course of antimony and pentamidine, and three patients had taken one additional course of ketoconazole besides many courses of antimony and pentamidine. The clinical response started just after first infusion in 8 patients, and the patients became afebrile. By 5th infusion, all looked better and 18 patients became afebrile. By 15th infusion all patients were afebrile and cheerful. Their spleens became smaller and body weights and total white cell counts increased. Forty eight patients had parasitological cure at the end of treatment, and only 2 patients required an additional 5 infusions for parasitological cure. All patients were ultimately cured. No one relapsed within six months of follow up. All patients had shivering, rigor and rise of temperature on the day of infusion, which could be minimized with prior administration of low dose of hydrocortisone, but could not be eliminated. Eighteen patients had loose motions during treatment, while 14 patients had decrease in appetite which improved quickly when the treatment was over. Fourteen patients had transient rise of blood urea, in six patients serum creatinine also increased and 16 patients had a minor fall in serum potassium.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
