The effects of various doses of Thymopentin, the synthetic 5 aminoacid fragment of thymopoietin injected on d -4 and d -1 on murine host resistance to Listeria monocytogenes were tested. The experiments did not reveal any regular dose-effect relationship; i.e. no or only marginal (more often small negative rather than positive) effects were observed on clearance and on resistance neither during the T cell independent first hour or the first 2 days of infection in euthymic or thymus deficient nude mice, nor during the T cell dependent phase after 2 days of infection in euthymic mice. Also survival of mice was not increased in a regular dose-effect relationship with dose ranges of Thymopentin from 0.3 ng-30 mg per 30 g mouse; furthermore, injections of 3 micrograms per 30 g mouse for varying time intervals from -3 days before up to 6 days after infection had no protective effect. Thus Thymopentin apparently does not induce measurable macrophage activation directly or cannot increase macrophage activation mediated by T cells in euthymic mice nor does it induce adequate T cell responses in nude mice to promote improved resistance to Listeria.
