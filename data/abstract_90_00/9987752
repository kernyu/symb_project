Single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) method was used for nucleotide sequence variation analysis of the gyrase A subunit quinolone resistance determining region (gyrA QRDR) in a laboratory and clinical strains of M. hominis. The couple of primers selected for this region amplified specific product in clinical material. M. hominis cultures growing in the presence of different concentrations of ciprofloxacin were studied by the SSCP method. Ser(83) to Leu mutation described previously was detected in the presence of quinolone in concentrations of at least 10 mcg/ml. In addition, 11 clinical samples were tested. In all cases the results of SSCP were confirmed by direct sequencing of the region. In 2 cases the sequences of gyrA QRDR in clinical strains were the same as in the laboratory strain. A Ser(83)-Leu mutation was identified in 1 clinical sample, while in others nucleotide substitutes did not lead to changes in amino acid sequences. These data demonstrate high informative value of the SSCP method for evaluating nucleotide variation in gyrA QRDR and quinolone resistance of M. hominis.
