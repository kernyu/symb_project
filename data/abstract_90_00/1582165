A mannitol-salt medium supplemented with 0.002% tellurite (MSOT) supported the growth of 104 of 109 strains of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) while suppressing 74 of 102 strains of mannitol-positive, methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci. MSOT was equally or more sensitive and more differential than a similar formulation without tellurite for the isolation of MRSA from the skin and nares of hospitalized patients. Only S. haemolyticus produced dark gray-to-black colonies on MSOT similar to those of MRSA. MSOT is a useful adjunct to other nonselective culture formulations for the isolation of MRSA from contaminated sources.
