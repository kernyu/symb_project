The authors tried to standardize the method of assessment of the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of antimycotics for the evaluation of the sensitivity of opportunistic causal agents of mycoses. They paid attention to factors which cause deterioration of the reproducibility of tests and lead to intra- and interlaboratory variability of results. In conjunction with this the authors drew attention to the lack of uniformity of views on the application of these tests in clinical practice. In the author's view the reservation pertaining in particular to an inadequate correlation of results in vitro and in vivo do not cast doubts on the expedience of laboratory assessment of sensitivity. Testing of systemic antimycotics with a low pharmacotherapeutic index and a relatively high frequency of secondary resistance is particularly justified. In those instances assessment of MIC values is a significant component of monitoring of adequate antifungal chemotherapy, in particular when antimycotics are administered for prolonged periods to patients with altered immunity.
