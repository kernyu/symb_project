The in vitro susceptibility of Ureaplasma urealyticum (Uu) and Mycoplasma hominis (Mh) was evaluated in a multicentric study performed in seven hospitals from different geographic areas in France. During a three month period, 324 Uu and 72 Mh clinical isolates were tested using a system ready for use, SIR Mycoplasma (Sanofi Diagnostics Pasteur). For Uu, the percentage of strains intermediate (I) or resistant (R) was as follows: doxycycline (3), minocycline (2.5), lymecycline (6.7), erythromycin (72, most I), josamycin (0.9), clindamycin (88), pristinamycin (0.3), ofloxacin (34, most I). For Mh, the percentage of strains I or R was respectively: doxycycline (2.7), minocycline (5.5), lymecycline (15.2), erythromycin (100), clindamycin (1.4), ofloxacin (2.7), josamycin (0) and pristinamycin (0). Comparable results were observed in the different geographic areas. The frequency of acquired resistances does not justify modifications in the usual treatment of genital mycoplasma infections but leads to monitor their susceptibility to antibiotics.
