Fifty-eight Indian patients with visceral leishmaniasis who did not respond or relapsed after 30 days of consecutive sodium stibogluconate therapy were randomised to treatment with amphotericin B lipid complex (ABLC) using a total dose of 7.5 or 10 mg/kg. Treatment induced a prompt clinical response in all patients with resolution of fever and regression in spleen size. Fever and chills developed during ABLC infusion, but it diminished with successive infusions. Fourteen days after treatment, 26 of 28 (93%) patients in the 7.5 mg/kg group and all 30 (100%) in the 10 mg/kg group had splenic aspirate parasite density scores of 0 and were considered apparent clinical and parasitologic responders. Four and three patients in the 7.5 and 10 mg/kg groups respectively relapsed during six months of followup; thus, overall 22 of 28 (79%) patients treated with 7.5 mg/kg and 27 of 30 (90%) treated with 10 mg/kg were definitive cures. All initial non-responders and relapses were retreated successfully with higher dose of ABLC. These results confirm the efficacy of short-course ABLC therapy for antimony-unresponsive Indian patients with visceral leishmaniasis. Since treatment with a total dose of 7.5 mg/kg did not appear to increase efficacy (79% vs. 84% induced by 5 mg/kg in a prior study), initial treatment with a total dose of 5 mg/kg followed by retreatment of any non-responders represents a potentially less costly approach in patients who fail antimony therapy. Though high cure rates are achieved with > or = 10 mg/kg total dose of ABLC, treatment using lower doses with retreatment of non-responders or relapses with higher dose can result in considerable savings.
