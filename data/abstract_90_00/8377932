In the present study, we have investigated the effects of an activation of the ascending serotonergic pathway on the cerebral blood supply to a number (63) of well-defined neuroanatomical structures. To this end, we have measured the local cerebral blood flow during electrical stimulation of the dorsal raphe nucleus. Measurement of regional blood flow was performed in the conscious rat through the use of the [14C]iodoantipyrine autoradiographic technique. Stimulation of the dorsal raphe nucleus induced increases (> 15% compared to control) in cerebral blood flow in 17 structures of which statistical significance (P < 0.05) was achieved in nine; raphe stimulation significantly decreased flow in three regions. The greatest increases (+71 and +46%) were found in the frontal sensorimotor and posterior parietal cortices. Other increases were noted in relay stations of the extrapyramidal and limbic systems. Stimulation induced a decrease in two regions of the primary auditory system and in the lateral habenular nucleus. These results show that activation of the serotonergic pathway in the conscious rat effects regional cerebral blood flow heterogeneously, differing from the widespread increase in glucose utilization that we previously observed using the same experimental paradigm. Statistical analyses indicated that activation of the dorsal raphe nucleus resulted in a global modification of the flow-metabolism ratio. Moreover, in 19 out of 31 regions analysed, this ratio is significantly altered as compared to control. The dichotomy between raphe-induced changes in flow and glucose-metabolism could be explained by one or both of two hypotheses; firstly there could be a direct serotonergic innervation of cerebral resistance vessels; secondly, during raphe stimulation it could be that glucose use is not the primary determinant of tissue perfusion.
