ABT-538, a new protease inhibitor, appears to increase CD4 counts and viral load in HIV-infected persons. In a four-week placebo-controlled trial, investigators noted a CD4 count increase between 75 and 100 among participants in all four dosage groups. Dosages were either 300 mg, 400 mg, 500 mg or 600 mg, administered twice daily. Researchers still need to determine how long the CD4 increase will last and whether viral resistance will emerge.
