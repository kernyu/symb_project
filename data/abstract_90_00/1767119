The case notes of all deaths due to tuberculosis registered at the Institute of Pneumophysiology at Bucharest have been reviewed. Out of 273 patients registered, the diagnosis of tuberculosis was retrospectively confirmed 260 times on either bacteriology or histology and was not confirmed by analysis of the medical notes on 13 cases. Of the 260 cases (70% males) the ages range from 18 to 75. There was 95 new cases of tuberculosis, 68 were relapses and on 97 occasions it was chronic form. Resistant bacilli were isolated 79 times (63%). Intolerance to treatment was noted in 95 patients (36%) and an incomplete treatment occurred in 84 patients (32%). The death occurred before treatment could be instituted in 33 patients. Tuberculosis was multicavitatory in 192 cases (74%), was bilateral in 214 cases (82%). From the last admission on 140 patients whose bacteriology was available for studies 112 (80%) were positive on direct examination. Compared to another enquiry carried out in Bucarest between 1961 and 1968 on 350 deaths due to tuberculosis, it appeared that the patients in the more recent period were suffering from a more severe form of tuberculosis. The above facts witness the efforts made in Rumania to achieve an early diagnosis and treatment in the management of tuberculosis.
