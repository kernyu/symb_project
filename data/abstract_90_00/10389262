Samples were collected from 150 adult cats, processed for isolation of Staphylococcus species and tested for susceptibility to penicillin G, gentamicin, oxacillin, enrofloxin and tetracycline. Methicillin resistance was also determined. One hundred and four isolates were obtained (69.3% of samples). Coagulase-negative species were most common, and the most frequently isolated (33 samples) species was Staph. felis. Other coagulase-negative species, such as Staph. haemolyticus, Staph. simulans, Staph. epidermidis and Staph. saprophyticus were also isolated. Coagulase-positive staphylococci were obtained from 30 cats, and the only species recovered in this group was Staph. intermedius. Resistance to antibiotics was frequently observed, with 68.2% of the isolates showing resistance to at least one drug. Resistance to Penicillin G was observed in 68 of the 104 isolates (65.4%), 23 samples were resistant to oxacillin (22.1%), 33 to tetracycline (31.7%) and 24 to enrofloxin (23.1%). Gentamicin was the most active antimicrobial agent. The role of these microorganisms in the saliva of cats is discussed.
