Ideal treatment of HIV-1 infections should include an agent that can reverse the capacity of the virus to evade destruction by hiding in sanctuaries and by frequently mutating the epitopes it displays. The rapid proliferation of virions during the years of symptomatic quiescence obligates rapid replacement of CD4+ lymphocytes that leads to a gradual attrition of the T lymphocytes needed to control infections. In vitro evidences suggest that, given systematically, certain mitogenic lectins would interfere with HIV-1 invasion of CD4+ cells by blocking gp120 molecules on the viral membrane before activating T lymphocytes subsequent to binding with their Ti/CD3 molecules. The nonspecific nature of antiviral effector cells generated by this activation should circumvent HIV-1 mutations at the same time it reconstitutes depleted T lymphocytes, stimulates myelopoiesis, and reinforces resistance to malignancies and infections prevalent with the immunodeficiency state. Properly coordinating these effects with appropriate combinations of reverse transcriptase and protease inhibitors could theoretically expedite complete elimination of HIV in a timely fashion that shorten the required treatment duration and excludes the detrimental effects of virus mutations. The proper sequence of this treatment should be maximum reduction of the HIV-1 load with drug combinations, control of complicating infection by other means to reduce mitogen-induced tissue necrosis, and addition of systemic PHA-L4 administration regulated to maintain a 5-10 micrograms/mL serum concentration. The antiviral regimen should be continued an undetermined time beyond when HIV-1 is no longer detectable, and systemic L4 administration until satisfactory immunologic and hematologic competences are re-established. Partially-matched mitogen-activated adoptive leukocyte therapy might be additionally helpful.
