There are three main reasons for using antimicrobial agents in pig production: animal welfare, carcase quality and economics. The need to treat sick animals and to mitigate the effects of infection is of paramount humanitarian importance. The reduction of the pathological effects of infection is an essential aspect of carcase quality and of possible value in the control of potential zoonoses. It is beyond dispute that the judicious use of antimicrobial agents improves growth efficiency. In addition there are economic benefits to be gained from the control of infection in terms of improved carcase quality and reduced mortality. When antimicrobial agents are used, careful consideration must be given to their choice. An understanding of the disease complexes of pig herds, of pharmacokinetics and of methods of administration is necessary to achieve safe and cost-effective medication. Bacterial resistance to antimicrobial agents in pig production is of importance only in special circumstances where eradication of a disease is being attempted. Veterinarians specialising in pig production are concerned that there is a climate of restriction of use and availability of suitable agents which could jeopardize animal health and welfare.
