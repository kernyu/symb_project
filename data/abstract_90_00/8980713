Lung cell populations may be directly exposed to environmental airbone toxicants such as ozone (O3). Since pulmonary macrophages (M phi) play a pivotal role in host pulmonary immunocompetence, their function in this regard may be compromised by pollutant exposure thereby giving rise to an increased incidence of pulmonary disease. The current in vitro study was designed to provide some insight into possible mechanisms by which O3 induces decreased host pulmonary resistance against microbial pathogens. Specifically, this study investigated the impact of an acute O3 exposure upon the ability of a cultured mouse M phi cell line (WEHI-3) to interact with, and respond to, the major M phi-activating cytokine, interferon-gamma (IFN gamma). The results of this study indicate that WEHI-3 exposure to 1 ppm O3 for 4 h reduced both the binding of, and responsivity to, IFN gamma. Among the functional parameters affected by this inability to properly bind/respond to IFN gamma were: reactive oxygen intermediate production, phagocytic activity, and cellular calcium ion elevation; IFN gamma-enhanced expression of surface histocompatibility antigens was unaffected by O3 exposure. The reduced activity of any one of these critical M phi functions could provide a basis for previously-documented increases in microbial pathogen survival in the lungs, and overall compromise of host health following O3 exposure.
