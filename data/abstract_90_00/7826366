We examined drug sensitivity of human T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia H9 cells chronically infected with simian immunodeficiency virus (SIVmac) and found that the retrovirus-infected H9 cells showed 8.2-fold resistance to 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine (Ara-C). In the infected cells, Ara-CTP levels decreased to 20% of that found in uninfected H9 cells after 3 h incubation at Ara-C concentration of 1 microM, and 8.1-fold increase of cytidine deaminase activity was observed in the infected H9 cells. A competitive inhibitor of cytidine deaminase, 3, 4, 5, 6-tetrahydrouridine (THU), at 100 microM reversed Ara-C resistance in the infected cells. These results indicate that inducing increased cytidine deaminase activity by SIVmac infection conferred Ara-C resistance to H9 cells. An understanding of these cellular differences in drug sensitivity may aid in the development of therapeutic strategies against retrovirus-infected cells.
