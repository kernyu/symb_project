During 21 month study of bacterial conjunctivitis among 121 children in two health care centres in Calabar, Nigeria, a total of 90 (74.4%) cases were culturally confirmed. Neonates had the highest age-specific attack rates with 48 (53.3%) cases. Neisseria gonorrhoeae, the predominant pathogen, was recovered from 32 (35.6%) infections; 21 (65.6%) of them from neonates. Cultures of genital swabs of consenting parents of infected neonates as well as those of three female children aged 2-12 years with concurrent vulvo-vaginitis yielded N. gonorrhoeae. Younger women, mostly primi-gravidae were more frequently found to have benefited from peri-natal health care services than older multi-gravidae. Nevertheless, such access to health care services did not appear to influence the frequency of gonococcal conjunctivitis in neonates from the two maternal groups (P < 0.01). Sexual abuse and contaminated fomites were the possible modes of gonococcal infection transmission to older children. Overall, 22 (68.8%) strains of gonococci were resistant to penicillin; 19 (59.4%) were penicillinase-producing Neisseria gonorrhoeae (PPNG), while 5 (15.6%) had chromosomally-mediated resistance. All isolates were sensitive to erythromycin. This study recommends a review of gonorrhoea surveillance in pregnancy to include routine examination of cervical swabs just before delivery.
