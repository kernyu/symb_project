Infections are an increasing problem in the elderly population, because of the often atypical presentation and the more frequent occurrence of complications, which lead to increased morbidity and mortality. The increased prevalence of infections in the elderly is due to a number of factors: increased exposure to micro-organisms (especially in nursing homes); degeneration of various organs (atherosclerosis, pulmonary emphysema, diverticulosis, prolapse); decreased immune response; concomitant diseases (e.g. diabetes mellitus) and (or) use of medication. There is often a delay in the diagnosis because the presentation of infection in the elderly is frequently atypical and symptoms are attributed to old age, rather than to infection. Treatment may be hampered by increased resistance of micro-organisms, interaction with other drugs and toxicity problems.
