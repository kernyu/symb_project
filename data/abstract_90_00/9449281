Against penicillin-susceptible pneumococci, the activity of sanfetrinem was similar to those of penicillin, amoxicillin, cefotaxime, imipenem, and meropenem, while against penicillin-resistant strains, sanfetrinem and the carbapenems exhibited superior activity (MICs at which 90% of strains are inhibited, < or =1 microg/ml). PBP 1a in the penicillin-susceptible strain and PBP 1a and PBP 2b in the more resistant isolates seemed to be the essential penicillin-binding proteins for imipenem and sanfetrinem.
