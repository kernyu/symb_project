Polyradiculopathy caused by cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a rare but serious neurological disorder that occurs late in the course of HIV-1 infection and is potentially treatable with antimicrobial agents active against CMV. We describe a patient with CMV infection caused by a strain that was resistant to ganciclovir. This case demonstrates one potential mechanism of therapeutic failure and illustrates the potential pathogenicity of strains that are resistant to antiviral drugs.
