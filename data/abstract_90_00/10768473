The SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program was established to monitor the occurrence and antimicrobial susceptibility of bacterial pathogens via an international network of sentinel hospitals. Twenty European hospitals referred a total of 887 urinary tract infection (UTI) isolates to the European SENTRY reference laboratory during the period October-December 1997. Ninety percent of the referred species were represented by Escherichia coli (52%), Enterococcus spp. (12%), Klebsiella spp. (7%), Proteus spp. (7%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (7%), and Enterobacter spp. (5%). The susceptibility of E. coli isolates to penicillins was less than 60%, while almost all of the isolates were susceptible to piperacillin/tazobactam (98% susceptibility), cephalosporins (98%), and carbapenems (100%). Amikacin was the best aminoglycoside (99.8% susceptibility). The susceptibility to quinolones was only 88-89%, with highest levels of resistance observed for isolates from Portugal, Italy, England, The Netherlands, and some centers in France, Spain, and Poland. The susceptibility of Klebsiella spp. to the newer generations of cephalosporins was 82-95% and to the carbapenems 100%. Amikacin was again the best aminoglycoside (94% susceptibility). The susceptibility of Enterobacter spp. to any beta-lactam antibiotic was poor, except for the carbapenems (100% susceptibility) and cefepime (90% susceptibility), while the susceptibility to aminoglycosides was 80-89%. Proteus spp. showed complete susceptibility to cefepime, ceftriaxone, the carbapenems, and piperacillin/tazobactam, while the susceptibility of P. aeruginosa isolates was poor, with best results for the carbapenems (susceptibility 89%), piperacillin/tazobactam (susceptibility 84%), and amikacin and ticarcillin (susceptibility to both 80%). Enterococcus spp. showed the highest susceptibility to vancomycin (98%), teicoplanin (98%), and ampicillin (94%).
