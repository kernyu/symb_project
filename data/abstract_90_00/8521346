The objectives of this study were to determine the carriage rate of Yersinia enterocolitica in the tonsils of slaughter hogs, and to characterize them with regard to phenotypic and virulence-associated properties. Of 202 pigs examined from an abattoir in Prince Edward Island, 85 were culture positive for Y. enterocolitica. Sixty-seven percent of isolates belonged to serotype O:3, and 20% were serotype O:5. All isolates produced urease and 95% of O:3 isolates showed virulence-associated characters of autoagglutination at 37 degrees C and lack of fermentation of esculin and salicin. All isolates were tested for crystal violet binding, calcium dependency, and virulence plasmids. Eight isolates (5 belonging to serotype O:3, 2 belonging to O:5,27, and 1 belonging to O:7,8) were tested in addition for the production of heat-stable enterotoxin (ST), and iron-chelating siderophores. Of the 57 O:3 isolates, 93% were positive for crystal violet binding and calcium dependency and 98% possessed a 40-45 MDa plasmid. Four of the 5 O:3 isolates tested for ST related to Escherichia coli STa in a commercial enzyme immunoassay were positive. Six of the 8 isolates belonging to 3 different serotypes produced large orange halos around the colonies on a chrome-azurol-s agar assay medium, for siderophores. Antimicrobial susceptibility tests of all 85 isolates against 16 drugs showed 100% susceptibility against 12 drugs, including trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and tetracycline.
