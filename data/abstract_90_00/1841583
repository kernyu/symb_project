Two cases of endogenous Pseudallescheria boydii endophthalmitis are presented. One patient had severe pulmonary fibrosis but no history of ocular trauma and no clinical or laboratory evidence of immunocompromise. Despite therapy with repeated intravitreal miconazole nitrate injections and systemic fluconazole, enucleation of the globe was required, and the patient eventually died with disseminated pseudallescheriasis. The other patient was an immunosuppressed cardiac transplant recipient who also received systemic fluconazole therapy. The infected eye eventually required evisceration, but there was no evidence of disseminated pseudallescheriasis before his death of unrelated causes.
