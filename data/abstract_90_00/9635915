Antimicrobial resistance in nosocomial isolates is of increasing concern to the clinician, particularly in intensive care units. With more expensive drugs and prolonged periods of hospitalization required, resistance can result in increased healthcare costs. For the patient, infection with multiply resistant strains of bacteria is associated with high mortality rates. This review focuses on the prevalence of nosocomial infections throughout Europe, with particular emphasis on the prevalence of resistance to common antimicrobial agents. The beta-lactams are the most frequently prescribed antimicrobials, and the growing importance of extended spectrum beta-lactamases and the hyperproduction of chromosomal beta-lactamase by stably derepressed mutants in the development of microbial resistance are discussed. Given that the most common reason for modification of an initial empiric antibiotic treatment is the isolation of microorganisms not susceptible to the initial choice of treatment, the results from two European multicenter trials comparing the efficacy of the carbapenems, meropenem, and imipenem/cilastatin, for the treatment of serious nosocomial infections, are appraised. In light of these results, it can be concluded that the carbapenems are effective as initial empiric monotherapy for nosocomial infections because of their broad spectrum of efficacy and stability to beta-lactamases.
