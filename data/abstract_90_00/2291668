The frequency of trimethoprim resistance among Escherichia coli isolates from urine samples collected at Turku City Hospital, Turku, Finland, remained at 40% during 1984 to 1988. The proportion of highly resistant (MIC, greater than or equal to 1,024 micrograms/ml) isolates increased, however, and most of these harbored the type I dihydrofolate reductase gene. Only a few isolates possessed type II or VII genes.
