It has been suggested that the invasion of microbes into the catheter tract occurs mainly at the time of catheter insertion. To investigate whether the presence of an antimicrobial environment during the initial period after insertion is sufficient to reduce the risk of subsequent catheter colonization and infection, we evaluated the use of benzalkonium chloride-heparin bonded (BZK-hep) central venous catheters, which exhibit short-lived surface antimicrobial activity, using a rat subcutaneous model. Bacterial adherence on these catheters was determined, seven days after challenging the insertion site with 10(6) cfu of Staphylococcus aureus. A chlorhexidine-silver sulphadiazine impregnated catheter (Arrowg+ard), with longer lasting surface antimicrobial activity, and a hydrophilic coated catheter ('Hydrocath'), were evaluated simultaneously for comparison. Unlike Arrowg+ard antiseptic catheters, BZK-hep 'Hydrocath' and control catheters had significant bacterial adherence on their surface. Arrowg+ard catheters were colonized in 19% of the animals compared with 100% in all the other groups (P < 0.05; mean cfu cm-2: control = 1.3 x 10(6), BZK-hep = 4.3 x 10(5), Hydrocath = 2 x 10(5), Arrowg+ard = 71). Our results indicate that catheters with short-lived surface antimicrobial activity are unlikely to provide long-term protection against catheter-related infection. The efficacy of Arrowg+ard catheters may be due to the initial high rate of kill and prolonged antimicrobial activity.
