The effect of oxytetracycline-medicated feeds on antibiotic resistance in gram-negative bacteria from fish intestines and water in catfish ponds was investigated. In experiments in the fall and spring, using ponds with no previous history of antibiotic usage, percentages of tetracycline-resistant bacteria in catfish intestines obtained from medicated ponds increased significantly after 10 days of treatment. In the fall, resistance of the intestinal and aquatic bacteria returned to pretreatment levels within 21 days after treatment. In the spring, resistance declined after treatment but remained higher than pretreatment levels for at least 21 days in intestinal bacteria and for 5 months in aquatic bacteria. Plesiomonas shigelloides, Aeromonas hydrophila, and Citrobacter freundii were isolated frequently in both spring and fall; Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Edwardsiella tarda, and Enterobacter spp. were isolated primarily in the spring. Oxytetracycline treatment did not affect the distribution of bacterial species in the fall but may have accelerated a shift toward greater prevalence of members of the family Enterobacteriaceae in the spring. Multiple antibiotic resistance did not appear to be elicited by oxytetracycline treatment.
