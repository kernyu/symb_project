The paper presents the current approaches to chemotherapy in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis and shows the main reasons that do not allow one to achieve high outcomes of treatment. These involve the drug resistance of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the morphological features of a specific process in the lung, the higher incidence of acutely progressive types of pulmonary tuberculosis in particular; tuberculosis-contaminant diseases (diabetes mellitus, gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal diseases, and non-specific respiratory diseases, etc.). Recommendations how to eliminate the reasons for ineffective treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis are given.
