Although the MICs of 3'-hydroxy-5'-(4-isobutyl-1-piperazinyl)benzoxazinorifamycin, or KRM-1648 (KRM), for Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) were significantly lower than those of other drugs, its in vivo activity was very weak. Beginning 28 days after inoculation, beige mice that had been infected intravenously with 1.87 x 10(7) CFU of MAC 101 were administered KRM alone, clarithromycin (CLARI) alone, or CLARI plus KRM six times weekly for 16 weeks. In contrast to the mice treated with CLARI-containing regimens, the mortality and the mean spleen weights of mice treated with KRM alone (either 10 or 20 mg/kg of body weight per dose) did not differ significantly from those of untreated mice, their numbers of CFU were very much greater than pretreatment values, and multiplication of MAC was only slightly inhibited. Although monotherapy by KRM selected KRM-resistant mutants, the selection was very weak; the mean number of CFU and the frequency of KRM-resistant mutants increased by no more than 1 order of magnitude after 16 weeks of treatment with KRM at 20 mg/kg per dose. Selection of CLARI-resistant mutants was inhibited but not completely prevented by treatment of the mice with CLARI plus KRM. These results indicate that KRM displayed only a weak bacteriostatic effect against the isolate tested in the beige mouse model; its ability to enhance the antimicrobial effect of CLARI or to prevent emergence of CLARI-resistant mutants was very limited.
