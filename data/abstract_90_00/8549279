The role of quinolones in sexually transmitted diseases is still being defined. In vitro and in vivo efficacy of established agents against gonorrhoea after a single oral dose is well established, although problems with emerging resistance have been identified. However, among these agents only ofloxacin is reliably active against Chlamydia trachomatis infection, and only as a course of treatment. Preliminary trials with sparfloxacin are encouraging. Other new agents show potentially useful in vitro activity, but clinical studies are awaited. To date, clinical activity of quinolones in bacterial vaginosis has been disappointing. The efficacy of newer agents with anaerobic activity will be of interest. Chancroid can be cured with ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin; resistance has been reported, but is not yet clinically significant. Ofloxacin appears to be effective therapy for pelvic inflammatory disease, without the need for additional anaerobe cover. The possibility of improved clinical efficacy justifies further in vitro and in vivo studies.
