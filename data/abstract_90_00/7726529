The resistance of Campylobacter jejuni strains to the fluoroquinolones is increasingly frequent, and in our area it reaches nearly 50%. We studied the susceptibilities of 60 of these strains to 11 oral antibiotics. All strains except one were susceptible to the macrolides tested, with azithromycin being the most active agent tested. Of the rest of the antibiotics studied, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, clindamycin, and fosfomycin displayed good in vitro activities. Knowledge of the susceptibilities of these microorganisms to a varied group of oral agents is necessary in view of the appearance of multiresistant strains, such as those included in our series.
