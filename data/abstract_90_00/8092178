We present a sixth human case in which primary human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) infection occurred, despite antiretroviral prophylaxis, after accidental inoculation of infected blood. In the prior five instances, variables such as large virus dose, late administration of antivirals, viral resistance to zidovudine, and pre-existent immunosuppression, may have played a role in the treatment failure. In this case, high-dosage oral zidovudine was given within minutes of the accident and replaced 2 1/2 days later with interferon alpha and dideoxyinosine (ddl). Despite aggressive treatment, HIV-1 infection was demonstrated in blood, spleen, and brain tissue at autopsy 16 days later. Of the tissues studied, detection of HIV-1 was most prominent in the spleen. Double-label immunocytochemistry confirmed the morphologic impression that while some of the infected spleen cells were CD3-positive T cells, the majority were macrophages. Thus, current single or dual (zidovudine, ddl-interferon) therapies for accidental HIV-1 inoculation may not be effective in preventing early infection. Further trials in animals appear warranted to evaluate protection by other strategies, such as passive immunity or combinations of agents that penetrate the brain and attack HIV-1 viral replication at differing sites.
