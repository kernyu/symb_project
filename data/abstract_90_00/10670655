The secretion of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-4, IL-5, and IL-10 by antigen-stimulated lymph node cells, eosinophil maturation, and the antibody isotypes produced were examined during intraperitoneal infection of susceptible (B10.A) and resistant (A/Sn) mice with Paracoccidioides brasiliensis. Lymph node cells from resistant mice produced early and sustained levels of IFN-gamma and IL-2, whereas susceptible animals secreted low to undetectable amounts of these type 1 cytokines. Both mouse strains presented late and transient production of IL-4, whereas IL-10 was produced constantly throughout the course of disease. Resistant animals produced increasing levels of IL-5 in the chronic phase of the infection (from the eighth week on), whereas susceptible mice showed two peaks of IL-5 production, at the first and twelfth weeks after infection. Only the susceptible strain presented medullary and splenic eosinophilia concomitant with the raised IL-5 production. In resistant mice, the levels of IgG2a antibodies were significantly higher than those observed in susceptible mice, which preferentially secreted IgG2b and IgA isotypes. Taken together, these results demonstrate that a sustained production of IFN-gamma and IL-2 and a predominant secretion of IgG2a antibodies are associated with resistance to P. brasiliensis. In contrast, the production of low levels of IFN-gamma, early secretion of high levels of IL-5 and IL-10, eosinophilia, and a preferential secretion of IgG2b and IgA isotypes characterize the progressive disease in susceptible animals.
