Multidrug resistance represents a form of pleiotropic drug resistance that has a prognostic value in untreated AML. It may affect the outcome of current chemotherapy protocols. Therefore, MDR1 expression should be systematically investigated in prospective studies. In addition, restoration of drug sensitivity may be attempted by adding drug resistance modifying agents such as cyclosporins to standard chemotherapy. The clinical value of such an approach has to be established in currently ongoing phase III studies.
