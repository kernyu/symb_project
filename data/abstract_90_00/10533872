Taiwan has high prevalence of antibiotic resistant, community-acquired respiratory pathogens. We investigated whether there was a high frequency of antibiotic use in the community. Antimicrobial activity in urine was detected in 55.2% of 1182 patients on arrival at an emergency department, 25.1% of 203 internal medicine out-patients, 7.6% of 471 high school students, and 7.4% of 202 people at a centre for senior citizens.
