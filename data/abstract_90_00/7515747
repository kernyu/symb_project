The effects of eight prospective absorption enhancers on the nasal mucosa in rabbit have been assessed using an in vitro Ussing chamber technique. Sodium taurodihydrofusidate (STDHF), sodium deoxycholate (DC), polyoxyethylene-9-lauryl ether (BL-9), lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) were found to possess relatively high protein leaching activity, while sodium glycocholate (GC), sodium taurocholate (TC) and EDTA had relatively low activity. The permeation of fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled dextran (FD, M.W. 9400) as a model drug across the nasal mucosa was found to be greater in the presence of these enhancers. Their enhancement ratio was found to be in the order of BL-9 > STDHF > SDS > LPC > DC > EDTA > GC > TC, which correlated with the protein leaching activity. The differences in protein leaching and enhancement ratio dependent on the magnitude of change of membrane resistance (delta Rm), indicating that these enhancers damaged the membrane and increased FD permeation. delta Rm thus appears to be a useful indicator by which one can estimate nasal mucosa damage by the enhancers.
