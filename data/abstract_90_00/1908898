Ticarcillin- and tobramycin-resistant strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were shown to have a markedly increased sensitivity to antibiotics enclosed in liposomes. This was demonstrated by growth inhibition of two resistant P. aeruginosa strains in the presence of the liposome-enclosed ticarcillin and tobramycin at 2 per cent and 20 per cent of their respective minimum inhibitory concentration. The liposome-enclosed antibiotic was as effective against the beta-lactamase-producing strain as against the non-beta-lactamase producing strain. Entrapment efficiency of the two antibiotics with the dehydration-rehydration vesicle (DRV) method was largely superior to other methodologies used. Kinetic studies with DRV demonstrated that tobramycin and ticarcillin-loaded liposomes still contained 83 per cent and 67 per cent of drug respectively after 24 h at 37 degrees C.
