Four patients with deep mycoses were treated with itraconazole. Two patients had chromoblastomycosis, one patient each had aspergillosis and Rhinofacial zygomycosis. These patients were either resistant to or showed poor response to Amphotericin B and/or ketoconazole. After the initial clinical and mycological evaluation, itraconazole was given in a daily dose of 200 mg orally. All patients responded to the drug very well. No adverse effects attributable to itraconazole were detected.
