The multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP) is a drug efflux membrane pump conferring multidrug resistance on tumor cells. In order to look for compounds that can lead to reversal of such a resistance, the antituberculosis compound rifampicin, belonging to the chemical class of rifamycins, was examined for its effect on MRP activity in human multidrug resistant lung cancer GLC4/ADR cells. Rifampicin was shown to increase accumulation of the MRP substrate calcein in GLC4/ADR cells in a dose-dependent manner by inhibiting its MRP-mediated efflux from the cells; it also enhanced intracellular retention of another substrate of MRP such as the anticancer drug vincristine in the resistant cells. By contrast, the antituberculosis drug did not alter cellular levels of accumulation of either calcein or vincristine in parental drug-sensitive GLC4 cells. Other rifamycins such as rifamycin B and rifamycin SV were also demonstrated to increase intracellular accumulation of calcein in GLC4/ADR cells. These results therefore indicate that rifamycins, including rifampicin, probably constitute a new chemical class of modulators down-regulating MRP-mediated drug transport.
