Mycobacterial diseases often require prolonged therapy with multidrug regimens. Fluoroquinolones have excellent bactericidal activity against many mycobacteria; achieve effective serum, tissue, and intracellular levels following oral administration; and produce few adverse effects. These properties have led to the increasing use of fluoroquinolones for the treatment of mycobacterial infections. We reviewed clinical studies and reports involving the use of fluoroquinolones for mycobacterial diseases. Ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, sparfloxacin, and pefloxacin exhibit clinical efficacy against mycobacterial diseases, especially tuberculosis and leprosy. Fluoroquinolones have generally been administered in regimens that include other agents. However, when a fluoroquinolone has been found to be the sole active agent in a multidrug regimen, the ready emergence of resistance to fluoroquinolones has been recognized, just as when they have been used as monotherapy. Therefore, to forestall the emergence of resistance to fluoroquinolones during the treatment of mycobacterial diseases, these drugs should always be used in combination with at least one other active agent, and they should be used only when effective alternative drugs are not available.
