The increase in disease-causing organisms resistant to standard drug therapy has captured the attention of the medical community and the lay press. Drug resistance in rapidly growing bacteria can be detected within a short period. However, in the case of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, detection may take weeks. This paper examines the current methods available to determine drug susceptibility in M tuberculosis. These laboratory methods can be used as a model to assist the clinician in making rational decisions when managing patients with potentially resistant bacterial infections.
