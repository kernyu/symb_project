The new oxazolidinone antimicrobial agents U100592 and U100766 demonstrated good in vitro inhibitory activity against clinical strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis regardless of methicillin susceptibility. Both agents appeared bacteriostatic by time-kill analysis. Stable resistance to low multiples of the MIC of either drug could be produced only in methicillin-resistant S. aureus.
