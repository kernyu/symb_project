We surveyed 387 clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) obtained from 26 hospitals isolated in 1993 to determine whether they became resistant to arbekacin (ABK). Twenty-five ABK-resistant MRSA (6.5%) were isolated from 9 hospitals. Analysis of genomic DNA fingerprinting by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis was used to confirm the classification by resistance patterns, phage typing and other biological characters. After digestion with endonuclease SmaI, two or three types of restriction patterns were found in ABK-resistant MRSA isolated from each hospital. We concluded that ABK-resistant MRSA may spread through nosocomial MRSA infections.
