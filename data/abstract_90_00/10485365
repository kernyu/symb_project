Anthelmintic-resistance has emerged as a problem in several animal industries. In the horse, cyathostome resistance to all available treatments except for the avermectin/milbemycins means that these drugs provide the cornerstone of control. Ivermectin has been available for several years; the related compound moxidectin is more recent. Although we do not know for sure, aspects of moxidectin such as its persistent action and its efficacy against mucosal stages of cyathostomes, may enhance the rate of development of resistance. On the other hand, selection pressure would be reduced if the persistence of moxidectin allows it to be used less frequently in the field. Reduced anthelmintic usage and surveillance of egg reappearance period are the most useful tools in managing resistance.
