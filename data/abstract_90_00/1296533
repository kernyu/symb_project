Activity patterns of membrane-bound enzymes of an antibiotic sensitive strain of Staphylococcus aureus 8325-4 and its variants containing the plasmids of resistance to penicillin, tetracycline, erythromycin and chloramphenicol were studied. It was shown that acquiring of resistance to the above mentioned antibiotics influenced cellular energy metabolism. The resistant strains exhibited an increase in the specific activity of NADN, malate and succinate oxidases, intensification of the ATP-hydrolyzing activity, changes in the activity of definite dehydrogenases and a decrease in the specific content of cytochromes. No changes in the composition of respiration carriers were detected.
