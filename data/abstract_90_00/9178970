A 40-year-old male was admitted to our hospital on August 30, 1994 to receive a new ulcerative colitis (UC) therapy, leukocytapheresis (LCAP). On the admission day, he had bloody stool 5 to 6 times/day, abdominal pain, slight fever, and hypoproteinemia. His UC type was moderately severe left-sided colitis with pseudopolyposis. Prior to admission to our hospital, his condition had not improved for about 9 months, despite drug therapies such as salicylazosulphapyridine, intravenous high dose prednisolone, protease inhibitor, intraarterial hydrocortisone sodium succinate, 4 series of pulse therapies with metylpredonisolone, enema of corticosteroid, azathioprine (Imuran), and cyclosporine at another hospital. Thus he was introduced to our college hospital and treated by LCAP since September 1. After 10 LCAP sessions, remission was observed and the patient discharged on December 23. Until he was later operated on for heavy bleeding after he had discontinued treatment and had drunk heavily, he had maintained remission for 13 months with LCAP only once a month even after we gradually decreased the other medical supports and stopped all of them. After LCAP, the normalization of high percentage of leukocytes presented HLADR+ and lymphocytes presented CD 11 a+ CD 8+ was also observed. This suggests LCAP intercepts the excess immune reaction in UC by removing leukocytes.
