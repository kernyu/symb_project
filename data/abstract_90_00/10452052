100 separate Staphylococcus aureus (S. a) isolates at Beijing Jishuitan Hospital during Oct. 1994-Apr. 1995 were submitted to determine the proportion of methicillin-resistant S. a (MRSA) and susceptibility test to 12 antibiotics. MIC determinations of the antibiotics were performed. Also, production rate of enterotoxin was measured with RPLA method. The results showed that MRSA constituted 60% of all cultures. (Burns Dept. 67.4%, Internal Medicine 62.5%, Orthopedics Dept. 44%). The antibiotics with resistant rate of MRSA below 50% included vancomyin (3.3%), norvancomyin (5%) and amikacin (21.5%). The production rate of enterotoxin was 100% in MRSA and 20% in MSSA (methicillin-sensitive S. a). In this group, 35% of MRSA and 5% of MSSA produced more than 2 types of enterotoxin.
