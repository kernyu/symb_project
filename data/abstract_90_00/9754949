We report on a cross-sectional study of virological and immunological surrogate markers of HIV infection in 115 patients for whom a determination of the pol 215 and pol 41 zidovudine (ZDV) resistance mutations had been described between January 1995 and February 1996. The patients received ZDV alone or a combination of ZDV and zalcitabine or didanosine. A total of 55, 15 and 45 patients exhibited a wild (W), a mixed (MIX) or a mutant (M) genotype at codon pol 215, respectively; 85, 10 and 20 patients exhibited a W, a MIX or a M genotype at codon pol 41, respectively. Patients exhibiting the pol 215 M genotype had lower CD4 cells, higher plasma viral load and higher proviral burden than patients exhibiting the pol 215 W genotype. Patients who had variants exhibiting both pol 215 M and pol 41 M or MIX genotypes had significantly worsened surrogate marker values than patients having variants only carrying the pol 215 M genotype. These observations demonstrate that the two mutations additively associate with pejorative surrogate markers.
