The incidence of tuberculosis has continued to decline in the Swedish-born population, but there has been an increase in the foreign-born population, especially among young adults and children. Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis is still rare in Sweden. The annual number of patients with culture confirmed atypical mycobacteria, especially of M. avium-intracellulare, has increased. The increased incidence of atypical mycobacteria observed in non-BCG vaccinated Swedish children seems to be related to the restricted BCG policy brought into force in 1975.
