The present study was undertaken to compare the efficacy and safety of a new regimen of cefaclor (25 mg/kg BID) with amoxicillin-clavulanate and erythromycin TID at standard doses for the treatment of pediatric patients with acute pharyngotonsillitis (APT). A total of 673 children (age range, 2 to 12 years) with signs and symptoms of APT were enrolled; 245 of these children who had a positive throat culture for group A beta-hemolytic streptococci (GABHS) entered the study and were randomly assigned to receive cefaclor 25 mg/kg BID, amoxicillin-clavulanate 15 mg/kg TID, or erythromycin 15 mg/kg TID. A 10-day antibiotic course was prescribed for each patient. Clinical and bacteriologic responses were assessed at the end of treatment (day 10) and at the follow-up visit (day 30). All GABHS strains isolated from throat cultures were tested for in vitro sensitivity to the antibiotics used in the study. Side effects (mainly nausea) were rare and mild in each group and did not require discontinuation of therapy. No GABHS strain was resistant to cefaclor or to amoxicillin-clavulanate; 37.9% of the strains were resistant to erythromycin. The results indicated that cefaclor given BID seems to be as effective as amoxicillin-clavulanate given TID (cure rate, 91.9% and 90.5%, respectively) and more effective than erythromycin given TID (cure rate, 76.8%) for the treatment of patients with APT. Erythromycin resistance among GABHS is an emerging problem in many geographic areas.
