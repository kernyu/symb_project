To evaluate the incidence and the significance of resistance to erythromycin among clinical isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae, we identified and prospectively followed all hospitalized patients in a 27-month period who had the organism isolated from any clinical sample. Patients who had an infection caused by pneumococci resistant to erythromycin (minimum inhibitory concentration, > 1 microgram/mL) were compared to those with infections caused by erythromycin-susceptible organisms. The incidence of erythromycin resistance among pneumococci doubled over the study period (from 7.6% in 1988 to 15.2% in 1992). Most strains (94%) showed resistance to multiple antibiotics, including other macrolides. By multivariate analysis, an age of < 5 years and nosocomial acquisition of the infection were independent risk factors for erythromycin resistance. Among patients with pneumococcal pneumonia caused by erythromycin-resistant organisms, 9 patients treated with third-generation cephalosporins were cured, while therapy with erythromycin failed for 2 of the 6 patients to whom it was administered. The rapid and significant increase of erythromycin resistance among clinical isolates of S. pneumoniae points to the need for routine surveillance of pneumococcal resistance.
