In a volunteer pharmacokinetic study mean peak serum concentrations of lomefloxacin of 7.19 mg/l were obtained 1.5 h after an oral dose of 400 mg. Women had higher concentrations than men. Urinary excretion was 34% in 6 h and 63% in 24 h and the mean peak concentration was 699 mg/l. Saliva concentrations were 37% of those in serum. Lomefloxacin was detectable in the faeces up to seven days after the last dose. The major effect of lomefloxacin on the faecal flora of volunteers following a four day course of 400 mg once daily was the elimination of strains of Enterobacteriaceae and an increase in the numbers of Gram-positive cocci, mainly streptococci. There was no effect on anaerobic bacteria or yeasts. Lomefloxacin was well tolerated and no side effects were recorded. No bacterial resistance was detected after treatment.
