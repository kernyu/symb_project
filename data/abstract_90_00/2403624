Vanuatu, which formerly was known as the New Hebrides, is an archipelago in the southwest Pacific Ocean with a tropical humid climate. The national health system and the state of health of the population generally are satisfactory. The main diseases of public-health importance are malaria and tuberculosis. Their epidemiology and control are discussed. An epidemic of Plasmodium falciparum malaria, which commenced in 1980, is described; this possibly can be explained by an increase in chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum over the same period. Other diseases also are reviewed. Many tropical diseases of great significance elsewhere are not of much significance in Vanuatu. Medical advice for visiting travellers is provided.
