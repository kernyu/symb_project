OBJECTIVE: To observe the mutations of rpsL gene in M. tuberculosis streptomycin-resistant isolates, and to develop a new method for detecting drug resistance. METHOD: Detecting the rpsL genes with PCR-SSCP and analyzing their codons 43 by PCR-RFLP. RESULTS: Strain H37Rv was used as a control. In 22 M. tuberculosis clinical isolates, the rpsL PCR fragments from 5 drug-susceptible isolates had no differences in the SSCP profiles with strain H37Rv, and were restricted by Mbo II. 11 of the 13 streptomycin-resistant isolates showed apparent differences in the SSCP profiles and were not digested with Mbo II. 1 of the 4 other drug-resistant isolates also had apparent SSCP differences and was not digested by Mbo II. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggested that the rpsL gene mutation was frequently observed in M. tuberculosis streptomycin-resistant isolates, and usually situated at codon 43, PCR-SSCP and PCR-RFLP might become a simple, rapid and reliable diagnostic test for drug resistance.
