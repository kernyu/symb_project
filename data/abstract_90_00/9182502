Antibiotic susceptibility of four Pseudomonas species i.e. P.aeruginosa, P.cepacia, P.mallei and P.pseudomallei was studied under conditions of different temperature and pH of the medium (within the physiologically possible deviations). It was shown that along with the general tendencies (lowered MICs at the medium alkalization) there were obvious species differences in the effect of the physicochemical factors on the Pseudomonas antibiotic resistance. The results of the study may to a certain extent serve as an explanation of the lack of coincidence of the chemotherapy efficacy with the data on the drug in vitro estimation.
