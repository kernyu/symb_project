We determined the MICs of 63 quinolones against 14 selected reference and clinical strains of the Mycobacterium avium-Mycobacterium intracellulare complex. Sixty-one of the compounds were selected from the quinolone library at Parke-Davis, Ann Arbor, Mich., including N-1-tert-butyl-substituted agents. T 3761 and tosufloxacin were also tested. The activities of all 63 compounds were compared with those of ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin. The results showed 45 of the quinolones to be active against the M. avium-M. intracellulare complex, with MICs at which 50% of the strains were inhibited (MIC50s) of less than 32 micrograms/ml. Twenty-four of these quinolones had activities equivalent to or greater than that of ciprofloxacin, and nine of them had activities equivalent to or greater than that of sparfloxacin. The most active compounds were the N-1-tert-butyl-substituted quinolones, PD 161315 and PD 161314, with MIC50s of 0.25 microgram/ml and MIC90s of 1 microgram/ml; comparable values for ciprofloxacin were 2 and 4 micrograms/ml, respectively, while for sparfloxacin they were 1 and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. The next most active compounds, with MIC50s of 0.5 microgram/ml and MIC90s of 1 microgram/ml, were the N-1-cyclopropyl-substituted quinolones, PD 138926 and PD 158804. These values show that the tert-butyl substituent is at least as good as cyclopropyl in rendering high levels of antimycobacterial activity. However, none of the quinolones showed activity against ciprofloxacin-resistant laboratory-derived M. avium-M. intracellulare complex strains. A MULTICASE program-based structure-activity relationship analysis of the inhibitory activities of these 63 quinolones and 109 quinolones previously studied against the most resistant clinical strain of M. avium was also performed and led to the identification of two major biophores and two biophobes.
