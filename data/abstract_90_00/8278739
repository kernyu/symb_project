Resistant populations of the Bacteroides fragilis group bacteria (two reference ones and two isolated from human and Callithrix penicillata marmoset) were obtained by the gradient plate technique, to clindamycin, penicillin G, metronidazole and mercuric chloride. All the four tested strains were originally susceptible to the four antimicrobial drugs at the breakpoint used in this study. MICs determination for the four cultures gave constant values for each antimicrobial, on the several steps by the gradient plate technique. The intestinal human B. fragilis strains showed three DNA bands, that could be representative of only two plasmids in the closed covalently circular (CCC) form with molecular weights of approximately 25 and 2.5 Md. The results do not permit an association between the presence of plasmid in the human strain with the susceptibility to the studied drugs. The four strains were beta-lactamase negative in the two methods used, and no particular chromosomal genetic resistance marker was demonstrated. The resistance (MIC) observed, after contact with penicillin G and mercuric chloride, were two-fold in the four tested strains.
