In-vivo as well as in-vitro studies were carried out at regular intervals from 1979 to 1988 to monitor chloroquine resistance in P. falciparum in Bokajan and Manja PHC of Karbi Anglong district, Assam. The results showed no significant change in resistance status in the area. Intensified antivector measures, withdrawal of chloroquine pressure and prompt detection and treatment of P. falciparum cases with alternative drugs helped bring down the higher grades of resistant parasites by 1984, which however could not be maintained. The results of in-vitro tests correlated well with those of in-vivo tests. The Karbis seemed to have better immunity against the strain of P. falciparum than the non-Karbis residing in the area. However, there was no difference in the rate of sensitive and resistant cases detected amongst the two groups.
