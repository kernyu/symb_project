One of the mechanisms of isoniazid resistance to Mycobacterium tuberculosis has been proved to be the chromosomal deletion of katG. Based on this finding, 22 isoniazid-resistant isolates of M. tuberculosis obtained in Japan and Yemen were analysed for katG by polymerase chain reaction and catalase activity. Only six (27%) of the 22 isolates were compatible with the mechanism (lack of amplification of katG and loss of catalase activity). In contrast, eight isolates (36%) were katG positive but catalase activity-negative and eight (36%) were positive for both factors, indicating that isoniazid resistance is multifactorial and the deletion of katG was not the major cause of resistance in the isolates examined in this study.
