The sensitivity of P. falciparum to chloroquine, pyronaridine, artesunate and piperaquine (CQ, PD, AT, PQ) was assayed using in vitro microtechnique in south Yunnan in 1990. The resistance rates were 98.7% (75/76), 27.6% (16/58), 13.8% (9/65) and 97.7% (43/44) respectively, and ID50 were 125.0, 19.0, 4.7 and 243.3 nmol/L, respectively. The resistance rate against CQ showed no change as compared to the rates against CQ 5 and 9 years ago; but the ID50 was lower. CQ-resistant P. falciparum showed a marked cross-resistance to PQ, but not to PD and AT. AT-resistant P. falciparum exhibited cross-resistance to the above-mentioned three drugs. PD-resistant P. falciparum showed no cross resistance to AT, but showed cross resistance to CQ and PQ. In comparison with chloroquine-coated plates, the plates coated with pyronaridine, artesunate or piperaquine gave similar results as the former, which were shown by the rise in schizont inhibition rates along with the rise in drug concentration. It indicates that pyronaridine-, artesunate-, and piperaquine-coated plates can be used in the assay of sensitivity of P. falciparum to the three drugs.
