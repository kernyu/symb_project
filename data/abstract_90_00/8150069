The molecular epidemiology of the aacC1 and aacC2 genes, encoding 3-N-aminoglycoside acetyltransferases AAC(3)I and AAC(3)II, respectively, was studied by DNA-DNA hybridization. The sample included 315 gentamicin-resistant Gram-negative bacilli collected over a six-month period from patients attending a Spanish Hospital. The aminoglycoside resistance phenotype of these strains was also determined. The aacC1 probe hybridized with 39 strains, the aacC2 probe with 146 strains and both probes hybridized with 26 strains. The aacC1 gene was most frequently detected in Pseudomonas aeruginosa whereas the aacC2 gene was most frequently detected in enterobacteria and Acinetobacter spp. Strains harbouring aacC genes were isolated from both in- and outpatients with different infectious diseases, mainly urinary tract infections. As inferred from the results of Southern hybridization, both genes showed a wide horizontal dispersion among plasmids and bacteria.
