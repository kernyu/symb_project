Plasmids associated with resistance to streptomycin, to streptomycin plus chloramphenicol or to tetracycline in Staphylococcus hyicus isolated from the skin of pigs have been compared, by restriction endonuclease digest patterns, with similar staphylococci from human sources and with published DNA base sequences. Several plasmids from Staph. hyicus have proved to have a very similar structure to those described from Staph. aureus but others appeared very dissimilar. This confirms the opinion that staphylococci from animal skin share a pool of plasmids with those from human skin but may also possess some of quite different structure.
