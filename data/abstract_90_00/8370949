A 45-year-old renal transplant patient presented with a recent history of small reddish nodular lesions on thighs, back and face. Biopsy of the nodules revealed numerous hyphae. Trichosporon beigelii was isolated from the biopsy specimen. Marked improvement occurred after 2 weeks' treatment with fluconazole, although its MIC was 16 mg/l.
