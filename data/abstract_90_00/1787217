A colony of azamethiphos-resistant house flies, Musca domestica (L.), was obtained from Denmark and further selected in the laboratory with azamethiphos for four generations. LD50s for various insecticides were determined and compared with those of a susceptible house fly strain. The selected flies showed cross-resistance to all insecticides evaluated. The flies were highly resistant to most organophosphorus, carbamate, and chlorinated hydrocarbon insecticides except prothiophos, p,p'-DDT, and the pyrethroids. We conclude that the main mechanisms responsible for resistance are presumed to be factors other than acetylcholinesterase sensitivity and nerve sensitivity due to knockdown resistance.
