The data on the mechanisms of microbial resistance to fluoroquinolones are presented. Comparison of the susceptibility levels of the microorganisms isolated on the territory of Russia showed that among the gram-negative opportunistic isolates 84 per cent was susceptible to ofloxacin, 45 per cent to ampicillin/sulbactam, 70 per cent to cefotaxime, 80 per cent to ceftazidime, 85 per cent to amikacin and 62 per cent to gentamicin. Among the Salmonella, Shigella and Vibrio cholerae isolates no strains were resistant to ofloxacin. Among the Salmonella isolates from patients more than 30 per cent was resistant to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, trimethoprim/sulmethoxasole and tetracycline. Among the Salmonella isolates 65 to 90 per cent was resistant to the antibiotics. Among the V.cholerae isolates 59 per cent was resistant to trimethoprim/sulmethoxasole.
