The aim of this in vitro study was to determine the effect on impact fracture resistance of three methods for restoration of root-treated lower incisor teeth with otherwise intact natural crowns. In a control group (Group I) laterally condensed gutta-percha filled the entire root canal, whereas part of the root filling was removed to enable insertion of a 1 mm diameter post in the other two groups. Stainless steel posts were placed in Group II and experimental carbon fibre reinforced carbon (CFRC) in Group III. A composite resin luting agent was used to lute the posts, and standardized composite resin restorations were placed in each access cavity. Fifteen specimens of each group were tested to failure with a single impact force applied at 90 degrees to the mid-point inciso-cervically on the labial surface. The peak force, peak energy, and first peak total energy required to fracture each specimen were recorded. The results showed no significant difference between the three groups, nor was a difference in the mode or site of fracture observed. The results suggested that there is no advantage from the point of view of fracture mechanics in 'restoring' intact root-treated teeth with either stainless steel or carbon fibre reinforced carbon rods.
