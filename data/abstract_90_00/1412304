Widespread use and misuse of antiinfectiva have resulted in a problem of drug resistance linked to treatment of infectious diseases. In developing countries especially, the sale of such drugs is poorly controlled and the pharmaceutical industry is dumping obsolete products. Intensive marketing, lack of diagnostic facilities and receptive local cultural attitudes to new "wonder drugs" such as antibiotics, have resulted in dramatic unnecessary use of such. Therefore the ideal strategies for treatment of infectious diseases guided by microbiological diagnosis and resistance pattern are violated in most developing countries, leading to excessive use of antiinfectiva and development of resistance. This has serious consequences for the infections that cause most cases of infant mortality, namely malaria, diarrhoeas and infections of the respiratory tract. Improvements in this vicious circle of drug use and resistance can only be made by attacking several factors simultaneously. There is a need for general information, stricter legislation, essential drug lists, national drug policies, better knowledge of local resistance patterns, better diagnostic facilities, better knowledge about local beliefs about drugs and better communication to local health workers and the community.
