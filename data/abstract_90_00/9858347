BACKGROUND: Fluoroquinolones are one of the most widely used treatments for gonorrhoeae. Changes in the susceptibility of Neisseria gonorrhoeae to these agents may threaten their use. GOAL OF THIS STUDY: To report several resistant strains (>1 mcg/ml) isolated in the western United States and to evaluate the prevalence of strains with reduced susceptibility (ofloxacin 0.25 mcg/ml, ciprofloxacin 0.06 mcg/ml). STUDY DESIGN: The microbiology and epidemiology of three resistant strains were characterized and 12,761 other strains were evaluated for fluoroquinolone susceptibility as part of the Gonococcal Isolate Surveillance Project of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. RESULTS: Fluoroquinolone-resistant strains may appear sporadically. The prevalence of isolates with reduced susceptibility to fluoroquinolones remains low in the Southwest region of the United States. CONCLUSIONS: Continued active surveillance is needed to detect and control the spread of quinolone-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae.
