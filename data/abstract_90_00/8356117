Two versatile Clostridium perfringens-Escherichia coli shuttle vectors were constructed. Each plasmid carried a single antibiotic resistance gene which was expressed in both organisms. The plasmid pJIR750 encoded resistance to chloramphenicol and pJIR751 encoded resistance to erythromycin. Each plasmid contained the pUC18-derived multiple cloning site and the lacZ' gene which enabled direct screening for recombinants in E. coli. These plasmids should prove invaluable for the genetic manipulation of C. perfringens.
