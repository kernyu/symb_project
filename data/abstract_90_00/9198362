We investigated the hemodynamic, renal, and hormonal effects of cyclosporin A (CyA) treatment (6 mg/kg per day) for 4 weeks in 12 patients with nephrotic syndrome (8 women: 4 men, aged 36-66 years, 3 cases of focal glomerular sclerosis: 9 cases of membranous nephropathy). To evaluate the effects of CyA on the diurnal variation of blood pressure (BP), 24-h non-invasive BP monitoring was performed using model ABPM-630 (Nihon Colin, Tokyo, Japan) before and during CyA treatment. As indices of hemodynamics, intra-arterial pressure was monitored and cardiac output was measured by the dye-dilution technique using a cuvette at 0 and 4 weeks after treatment. CyA ameliorated urinary protein excretion and hypoproteinemia from 3.5 +/- 0.9 to 2.2 +/- 0.7 g/day, and serum protein concentration from 4.9 +/- 0.2 to 5.5 +/- 0.2 g/dl after 4 weeks' treatment. Endogenous creatinine clearance, 24-h urinary sodium excretion, and plasma renin activity decreased significantly at 1 week. CyA treatment raised casual BP from 122 +/- 4/75 +/- 2 to 140 +/- 5/87 +/- 3 mmHg after 1 week and to 146 +/- 4/90 +/- 2 mmHg after 4 weeks. Before treatment 24-h ambulatory BP monitoring showed BP reduction at night (116 +/- 5/68 +/- 3 mmHg) compared to the daytime (124 +/- 5/75 +/- 2 mmHg). The diurnal variation of BP disappeared during CyA treatment; mean daytime and nighttime pressures were 135 +/- 4/81 +/- 2, 132 +/- 5/80 +/- 3 mmHg at 1 week and 139 +/- 5/83 +/- 3, 131 +/- 6/80 +/- 3 mmHg at 4 weeks, respectively. On hemodynamic study; a 4-week treatment with CyA increased mean arterial pressure from 91 +/- 3 to 104 +/- 3 mmHg, total peripheral resistance index from 2.1 +/- 0.1 to 2.5 +/- 0.1 x 10(3) dyne.sec.cm-5.m2, and unchanged heart rate and cardiac index. Serum Mg concentration decreased from 2.1 +/- 0.1 to 1.7 +/- 0.1 mg/dl. These results suggest that CyA-induced hypertension is characterized by the loss of nocturnal decline in blood pressure, which is accompanied by volume retention after 1 week and systemic vasoconstriction after 4 weeks.
