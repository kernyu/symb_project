Inflammatory fibrosarcoma is a rare condition in childhood. In the abdominal location, its behaviour is often aggressive and potentially metastasizing. We report a case of a 3-year-old female with abdominal inflammatory fibrosarcoma who relapsed after 1 month from radical surgery. Chemotherapy was ineffective, and we registered a brief stabilisation of disease only with alpha-IFN. Our case confirms the potential malignancy of this tumour and its resistance to treatment. It is noteworthy that the therapy with alpha-IFN improved the quality of life in this child for 4 months.
