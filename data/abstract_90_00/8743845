The sensitivity to a given number of antibiotics of 205 strains of enterococci, isolated for a period of one year was studied. The enterococci were isolated from materials, sent for microbiological examination in different clinical settings 55 strains of enterococci from the lower genital tract were tested (vaginal and cervical secretions), 36 strains from the upper genital tract (lochia, peritoneal aspirates, IUD), 8 strains from wounds (perineal and abdominal), 37 strains from urine and 69 strains from the newborns. There was a high sensitivity towards carbenicillin--92.7% towards azlocillin 91.2% and towards ampicillin--83.9% The strains, isolated from gynecologic patients showed increased resistance towards aminoglucosides--49.5% towards gentamycin and 46.5% towards amicacin. The resistance towards gentamicin in the newborns was 68.1%. The strains from urine were resistant to cyprofloxacine in 29.7%. All the enterococci tested were practically resistant to cefamandole and oxacilline. The author suggests that for initial therapy in proven or suspected enterococcal infection carbenicilline, azlocillin and ampicillin. They are suitable both for gynecologic patients and newborns. The aminoglucosides have to be administrated after testing because of the significant resistance found for the different strains. The same is true for erythromycin and cyprofloxacine
