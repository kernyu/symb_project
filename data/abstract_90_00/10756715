Strain 101/1, isolated from petroleum wastewater sediment was classified as Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In wild type condition the strain tolerated phenol in concentration 1,000 mg/L under aerobic conditions and 800 mg/L under denitrifying conditions. As a result of adaptation to phenol the resistance of the strain to the compound increased to 1,600 and 1,400 mg/L, respectively. Maximum phenol activity under aerobic and denitrifying conditions was 350 and 65 mg/L x day-1, respectively. Under denitrifying conditions a reduction in incubation temperature from 30 degrees C to 20 degrees C resulted in two-fold drop in phenol activity of the adapted strain and reduction in tolerance to phenol by 400 mg/L.
