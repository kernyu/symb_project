The in vitro activity of sparfloxacin was compared with those of tosufloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and fleroxacin against 730 bacterial isolates representing 49 different species. Sparfloxacin and ciprofloxacin had similar spectra of activity, but sparfloxacin was less active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and more active against many gram-positive cocci and anaerobic bacteria. Tosufloxacin MICs were generally 8- to 16-fold lower than those for sparfloxacin or ciprofloxacin. All four fluoroquinolones were active against nalidixic acid-susceptible strains of the family Enterobacteriaceae (MIC for 90% of the isolates [MIC90], less than or equal to 0.25 micrograms/ml) but nalidixic acid-resistant strains were less susceptible (MIC90, greater than or equal to 4.0 micrograms/ml). Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates, MIC90s were 1.0 micrograms/ml for tosufloxacin, 2.0 micrograms/ml for ciprofloxacin, and 4.0 micrograms/ml for sparfloxacin. Against Enterococcus faecalis, sparfloxacin and ciprofloxacin MIC90s were 1.0 and 2.0 micrograms/ml, respectively. MIC90s for ciprofloxacin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus were 0.016 micrograms/ml for tosufloxacin, 0.06 micrograms/ml for sparfloxacin, and 0.5 micrograms/ml for both ciprofloxacin and fleroxacin. With four species of gram-negative bacilli, mutants resistant to two to four times the sparfloxacin MIC occurred spontaneously at frequencies of 10(-7) to 10(-9): single-step high-level resistance was not observed. In vitro-selected sparfloxacin-resistant mutants displayed cross-resistance to other quinolones, as did clinical isolates of ciprofloxacin-resistant S. aureus. Tosufloxacin MICs with broth microdilution methods were four- to eightfold greater than those obtained with agar dilution methods. The two procedures gave comparable results when sparfloxacin or ciprofloxacin was being tested.
