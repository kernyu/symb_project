BACKGROUND: The demographic and subsequent economic pressures in developing nations have contributed to the increasing levels of antibiotic resistance among both commensal flora and pathogenic bacteria. As empirical options are diminishing daily, the role of ciprofloxacin in pediatric infections is becoming increasingly significant. OBJECTIVE: The levels of resistance among various enteric pathogens are described, and the efficacy and safety of ciprofloxacin in treating infections such as shigellosis, cholera and Escherichia coli gastroenteritis are discussed. The findings of a large study of invasive salmonellosis in children in rural Africa are briefly presented, including the role of ciprofloxacin in multiresistant invasive disease. In addition the role of ciprofloxacin as a chemoprophylactic agent in the control of meningococcal disease is discussed. RESULTS: The efficacy and safety of ciprofloxacin in children were found to be similar to those observed in adults for gastrointestinal infectious diseases. Overall the data presented confirm that ciprofloxacin is a safe and efficacious agent for use in children in the developing world. CONCLUSION: Ciprofloxacin has been shown to be safe and efficacious in children in developing countries. Subsequently a priority for both the pharmaceutical industry and regulatory authorities in developing nations is to prevent fluoroquinolone misuse and development of antibiotic resistance.
