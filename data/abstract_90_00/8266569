The binding of adriamycin and ethidium bromide coupled to sepharose beads with intracellular and serum immunoglobulins is detected. These drugs do not bind with Fab and Fc fragments of immunoglobulin. The binding of ethidium bromide to immunoglobulins is competitive. Possible adaptive features of this phenomenon are discussed.
