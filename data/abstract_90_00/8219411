There is considerable evidence of a relationship between the central nervous system and the immune system, and that several drugs with primary action at the central nervous system can affect different immune responses. In an attempt to obtain a better understanding of the interaction between ethanol's effects and immune functions, we used two mouse lines selected according to their high (HGP) or low (LGP) antibody production. These animals were injected with ethanol (20% w/v, 3.6 g/kg, ip); the latency for the loss of the righting reflex (LORR) and the time for the recovery of the righting reflex (RORR) were measured. Body temperature of both lines was also recorded before the injections and at RORR. Blood samples were taken at RORR to determine blood ethanol concentration. The results showed that the HGP mice presented shorter latency for sleep, longer sleeping time, and lower blood ethanol levels than the LGP mice. These data suggest that the HGP line is more sensitive to the effects of ethanol, and provide an additional approach for studying interactions between the immune and the central nervous systems.
