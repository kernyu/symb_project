Health, one of our most unassailable human values, transcends all geographic, political, and cultural boundaries. The health problems of the rapidly growing 80% of the world's population that live in the tropical developing countries of Asia, Africa, and Latin America pose major threats to industrialized as well as developing regions. These threats can be divided into three areas, or three "E"s: (1) emerging, reemerging, and antimicrobial-resistant infections; (2) exploding populations without improved health; and (3) erosion of our humanity or leadership if we ignore the growing health problems of the poor. Our assessment of current trends in global population distribution and resource consumption; DALY calculations, causes, and distribution of global mortality and morbidity; and the misperceptions about and maldistribution of resources for health point to the critical importance of addressing tropical infectious diseases and global health for preservation of democracy and civilization as we know it.
