In a prospective study of pneumococcal carriage in 200 Malawian children under 5 years of age, 47.5% were carriers. The carriage rate was highest in those aged 3-12 months and did not vary with family size, nor was it higher in those who had recently been admitted to hospital. Nasopharyngeal swabs were significantly more efficient than throat swabs in detecting carriers (p < 0.001) but nasopharyngeal swabs alone would have missed seven (8%) carriers. Pneumococcal isolates from 22% of carriers and from eight cases of meningitis and one of empyema showed intermediate resistance to penicillin (MIC 0.1-1.0 mg/l). All were sensitive to the 3rd-generation cephalosporin cefotaxime but one of the penicillin-resistant pneumococci and two of the clinical isolates had increased MICs of cefuroxime (0.5 mg/l).
