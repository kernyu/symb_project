An outbreak of gentamicin, ciprofloxacin-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa in an intensive care unit, was investigated. The majority of isolates were from sputum and the organism was not isolated from any other patient in the hospital, except those admitted to the unit. A prospective study was set up, and the organism was found to be associated with contaminated quivers, used to store suction tubing between use on ventilated patients. Once the quivers were disinfected and changed between patients daily, the outbreak stopped. Suction of ventilated patients may be an important source of contamination of the respiratory tract with nosocomial pathogens. It is important that infection control teams regularly review procedures to ensure the correct practices are being followed, so that nosocomial outbreaks of infection may be prevented.
