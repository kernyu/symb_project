The effects of dehydration/rehydration on two strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae: S600, a metabolically engineered xylose-utilising strain, and H158, the non-xylose-utilising host strain; and on the naturally xylose-utilising yeast Pachysolen tannophilus CBS 4044, were compared after glucose and xylose utilisation respectively. The yeast strains differed in their ability to excrete and accumulate intracellular xylitol. A high intracellular xylitol content before and after dehydration coincided with a higher viability after a dehydration/ rehydration cycle. The intracellular trehalose content increased during dehydration in all three yeast strains, but this did not correspond to enhanced cell viability after dehydration/rehydration. The results are discussed in relation to the ability of xylitol and trehalose to structure water.
