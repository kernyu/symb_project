A system for surveillance of drug resistance of etiologically important microorganisms in obstetric units and burn and sepsis centres was developed. Realization of the system with various methods is possible in case of permanent control and comparison of the results. The overwhelming majority (up to 90 per cent) of the etiologically important microorganisms were multiresistant. An information bank was filed. It could be used as a basis for developing principles of strategy and tactics in rational antibiotic therapy.
