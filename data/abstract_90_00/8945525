Resistance and susceptibility to Candida albicans infection have been shown to be dependent upon the activation of CD4+ T helper (Th) type 1 or Th2 cells, respectively. To study the type, kinetics, and cytokine dependency of CD4+ Th-cell responses in low-level C. albicans infection, susceptible mice were infected with sublethal doses of C. albicans and assessed for parameters of CD4+ Th-dependent immunity. Interleukin (IL)-12 and gamma interferon were always produced early in infection regardless of the pathogen load. In contrast, production of IL-4, and hence Th2-cell reactivity, was strictly dose dependent, being induced at the higher dose of the fungus. Production of IL-12 correlated with a successful control of infection in mice exposed to the lower doses of C. albicans but not with the development of acquired immunity. An antigenic stimulus appeared to be required for IL-12 to induce a protective anticandidal response. Cytokine depletion in vivo revealed that neutralization of IL-4 was protective early but not late in infection, suggesting a different role for IL-4 in the induction versus maintenance of an ongoing anticandidal Th response. Late in infection, an exacerbative effect was also observed upon IL-12 neutralization. These results indicate that the fungal burden and timing of cytokine appearance greatly influence CD4+ Th induction and effector functions in mice with candidiasis.
