Two models of helminthiases (nippostrongyliasis and trichocephaliasis) were used to reveal the therapeutical activity of leukinferon (LF). In experimental nippostrongyliasis, the efficacy of LF was similar to that in infected young rats and mice whose sensitivity and resistance to infections were different. In the model of trichocephaliasis, the therapeutical effect of leukinferon was noticeably higher in C57BL/6 mice resistant to T. muris than in sensitive mice strains. In intact animals, LF brought about similar lymphocytic prestimulation depending on their sensitivity to infection. The infection itself also caused increased LF levels comparable to those observed during LF administration to intact animals. LF-induced differences in cell prestimulation were especially great as infection progressed in animals whose sensitivity to host helminths was opposite. The levels of splenocytic LF was higher in resistant hosts (non-inbred mice with nippostrongyliasis and C57BL/6 mice with trichocephaliasis) that under the similar experimental conditions in animals (rats with nippostrongyliasis and DBA/2j mice with trichocephaliasis sensitive to host helminths).
