The purpose of this study was to determine whether sustained local production of murine IFN-beta (mIFN-beta) could inhibit the tumorigenicity and metastasis of human and murine tumor cells implanted into nude mice. Human melanoma cells (A375SM), renal carcinoma cells (SN12PM6), and colon carcinoma cells (KM12SM) were transfected with mIFN-beta or a control neomycin resistance vector. All cell lines grew well in culture. Tumor cells were injected into the subcutis, kidney, spleen, or lateral tail vein of nude mice. Parental or control transfected cells produced local tumors and experimental or spontaneous lung metastases, whereas mIFN-beta-transfected cells did not. In vivo survival experiments using [125I]IdUdR-labeled cells showed that by day 7 after s.c. implantation, all IFN-beta-transfected cells died. IFN-beta transfection prevented the outgrowth of parental or control-transfected cells only when they were injected together with transfected cells into one site, suggesting that IFN-beta promoted a local lysis of the bystander cells. Similar indirect antitumor activity was demonstrated in various human (KM12SM and SN12PM6) and murine (CT-26 colon carcinoma, RENCA renal cell carcinoma, and 3LL Lewis lung carcinoma) tumors. The IFN-beta-transfected tumor cells stimulated a high level of nitric oxide production by murine macrophages under in vitro and in vivo conditions, which correlated with the vigorous nonspecific antitumor activity. Collectively, these results demonstrate that local production of IFN-beta can eradicate tumor cells of different histology by inducing inducible nitric oxide synthase expression in infiltrating cells.
