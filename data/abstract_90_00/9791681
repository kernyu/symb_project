Antibiotic susceptibility of 446 Enterococcus isolates from 9 medical centres of Moscow and St. Petersburg was tested. Among the isolates 386 belonged to E.faecalis, 48 to E.faecium and 12 to the other species. All the isolates were susceptible to vancomycin. As for E.faecalis 84 and 85 per cent of the isolates were susceptible to ampicillin and ampicillin/sulbactam respectively (no production of beta-lactamases), the frequency of high resistance to aminoglycosides amounted to 44 per cent with respect to streptomycin and to 25 per cent with respect to gentamicin, 75 per cent of the isolates was susceptible to ciprofloxacin. As for E.faecium and the rare species of Enterococcus more than 70 per cent of the isolates was resistant to ampicillin and ampicillin/sulbactam, the frequency of high resistance to aminoglycosides exceeded 60 per cent, 17 and 25 per cent of the isolates were susceptible to ciprofloxacin.
