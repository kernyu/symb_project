We conducted a survey of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) among 16805 Escherichia coli and 9794 Klebsiella pneumoniae clinical isolates recovered from 196 separate medical institutions during the period January 1997 to January 1998. Using the criteria for minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of oxyimino-cephalosporins of >/=8 microg ml(-1) and confirmation by double-disk test, we detected 15 E. coli and 34 K. pneumoniae isolates producing ESBLs. Genotypes of ESBLs determined by PCR with type-specific primers included one TEM-derived and 24 SHV-derived ESBLs, in addition to 24 Toho-1-type ESBLs, one of the major types of ESBLs reported in Japan. Nucleotide sequence analysis of SHV-specific PCR products revealed that SHV-12 was the dominant type of SHV-derived ESBL. In addition, we also identified TEM-26 and SHV-2. This is the first report characterizing TEM- and SHV-derived ESBLs in Japan.
