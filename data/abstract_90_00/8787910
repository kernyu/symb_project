The phenotype of Klebsiella pneumoniae HEL-1 indicates a plasmidic cephamycinase gene (blaCMY-2). Its sequence shows one open reading frame coding for a protein of 381 amino acids. CMY-2 is classified as class C beta-lactamase that is closely related to the plasmidic enzymes BIL-1 and LAT-1 and the chromosomal AmpC of Citrobacter freundii. The blaCMY-2 gene possibly was translocated onto a plasmid of C. freundii which spread to K. pneumoniae.
