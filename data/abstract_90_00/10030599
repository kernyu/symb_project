This study examines the efficacy of the bonding of rifampicin, vancomycin or gentamicin to gelatin-coated knitted polymer meshes to prevent perioperative infection. Antibiotic bonding was obtained by soaking the meshes for 15 min in a solution containing 20 mg ml(-1) of rifampicin or 10 mg ml(-1) of vancomycin or gentamicin. A polymer mesh was implanted in a subcutaneous pouch in 16 rabbits: four received a rifampicin-soaked mesh, four received a vancomycin-soaked mesh, four received a gentamicin-soaked mesh, and four received an untreated mesh (control group). At the time of implantation, all the meshes were contaminated locally with 10(8) colony forming units of Staphylococcus aureus. Meshes were harvested one week later and submitted to bacterial counts. At the time of explantation, none of the antibiotic-soaked meshes were infected, whereas all the untreated meshes were infected. These results show that antibiotic soaking evidently prevents perioperative infection of gelatin-coated knitted polymer meshes in this model.
