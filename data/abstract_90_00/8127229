Four benomyl-resistant mutants isolated from Metarhizium anisopliae were 10 to 500 times more resistant than the original MT strain. The resistance markers analysed in three of these mutants were due to three different mutations and no additive effect of these genes was observed in double mutants. The four mutants presented normal conidiation in the presence or absence of benomyl and no sensitivity or resistance to temperature. Probably M. anisopliae has a mechanism of benomyl resistance differing from those of Aspergillus nidulans and Neurospora crassa.
