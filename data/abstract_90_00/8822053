Antibacterial activity of pazufloxacin (PZFX) against 65 strains of Shigella spp., 13 strains of Salmonella spp., 7 strains of Escherichia coli, 4 strains of Vibrio parahaemolyticus, 4 strains of V. cholerae O1, 2 strains of Aeromonas spp., 4 strains of Plesionomas shigelloides and 3 strains of V. cholerae non-O1 isolated from patients of infectious enteritis and carriers was compared with that of ofloxacin (OFLX), ciprofloxacin (CPFX), tosufloxacin (TFLX) and nalidixic acid (NA). The MIC90 of PZFX against Shigella spp., Salmonella spp. and E. coli were 0.025, 0.025 and 0.025 micrograms/ml, respectively. The MIC90 of PZFX against Shigella spp. was comparable to that of CPFX, 2-fold higher than that of TFLX and 4-fold lower than that of OFLX. Against Salmonella spp., MIC90 of PZFX was comparable to TFLX and 2- to 8-fold lower than those of CPFX and OFLX. PZFX showed the highest antibacterial activity between the drugs tested. Against other species, the MIC90 values of PZFX were < or = 0.006-0.1 micrograms/ml. No NA-resistant isolates were observed. The antibacterial activity of PZFX against stocked strains (clinical isolates from Aug 1989 to Feb 1991), containing 51 strains of Shigella spp., 50 strains of Salmonella spp., 19 strains of E. coli, 12 strains of V. cholerae O1 and 13 strains of V. parahaemolyticus, was also investigated. The MIC90 of PZFX of each strains were 0.05 micrograms/ml for Shigella spp., 0.05 micrograms/ml for Salmonella spp., 0.1 micrograms/ml for E. coli, 0.0125 micrograms/ml for V. cholerae O1, 0.2 micrograms/ml for V. parahaemolyticus, respectively. As shown above, PZFX has strong antibacterial activity against isolates from infectious enteritis and this suggests the usefulness of PZFX for the treatment of these patients and carriers.
