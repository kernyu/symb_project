To assess the opinions of healthcare workers (HCWs) about a satellite videoconference as a means of earning continuing education credit, a telephone survey was conducted in September 1998, 1 month after a live interactive satellite videoconference on antimicrobial use and resistance. There were 180 registered sites in 45 states surveyed, representing 1,589 viewers: 764 nurses (48.1%), 201 physicians (12.6%), and 624 other HCWs (39.3%). Continuing education credit was requested by 51% of nurses, 31% of physicians, and 27% of all other HCWs. Although preferred learning formats varied, 70% of respondents said it was important to offer continuing education credit. Furthermore, 31% of the respondents stated that the videoconference influenced institutional strategies. We concluded that satellite videoconferences are a method to reach audiences around the world efficiently and effectively, provide the latest information, facilitate interaction, and meet some of the demand for continuing education credit for HCWs.
