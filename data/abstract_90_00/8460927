The in vitro activity of RP59500, a streptogramin antibiotic, against 146 clinical isolates of vancomycin-resistant gram-positive bacteria was examined. Five strains of the species Enterococcus casseliflavus and Enterococcus gallinarum, for which the MIC of vancomycin was 8 micrograms/ml, were also studied. Twenty-eight vancomycin-susceptible strains of Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium were included for comparison. The drug was highly active against Leuconostoc spp., Lactobacillus spp., and Pediococcus spp. (MICs, < or = 2 micrograms/ml). RP59500 was more active against vancomycin-susceptible strains of E. faecium than E. faecalis (MICs for 90% of the strains [MIC90s], 1.0 versus 32 micrograms/ml). Vancomycin-resistant strains of E. faecalis were as resistant to RP59500 as vancomycin-susceptible strains (MIC90, 32 micrograms/ml), but some vancomycin-resistant E. faecium strains were relatively more resistant to the new agent (MIC90, 16; MIC range, 0.5 to 32 micrograms/ml) than were vancomycin-susceptible organisms of this species.
