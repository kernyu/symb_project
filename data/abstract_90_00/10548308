Strongyloidiasis, a human intestinal infection with Strongyloides stercoralis, is difficult to treat with drugs. The factors influencing this phenomenon remain unclear. To determine the host factors involved in response to treatment, 46 patients with strongyloidiasis were treated with albendazole, followed-up for 1 year, and separated into two groups: cured and non-cured. Serum levels of specific IgA, IgE, IgG, IgG1, and IgG4 antibodies were estimated using S. stercoralis antigen. Significantly higher titers of IgG4 antibody were observed in the non-cured group than in the cured group (P = 0.016). A total of 88 patients were typed for HLA-DRB1 alleles and analyzed for serum levels of antibody. The S. stercoralis-specific IgG4 antibody titers were significantly higher in the HLA-DRB1*0901-positive group than in the negative group (corrected P = 0.044). These results suggest that HLA-DRB1*0901 is a possible genetic marker for resistance to treatment of S. stercoralis that is associated with elevation of S. stercoralis-specific IgG4 antibody titer.
