The best combination of primers and the annealing temperature of multiplex PCR for Campylobacter jejuni, Campylobacter coli, and Campylobacter lari were examined. The multiplex PCR was able to detect type strains of the three species. All results of identification of wild strains (30 strains of C. jejuni, 20 strains of C. coli, and 4 strains of C. lari) by the multiplex PCR coincided with those of the conventional biochemical identification tests, suggesting that the multiplex PCR can simultaneously differentiate C. jejuni, C. coli, and C. lari from wild strains of campylobacters easily and rapidly. Campylobacters were detected from sparrow feces by the multiplex PCR and antimicrobial sensitivities of the strains were determined to discuss the role of sparrows in contamination of broilers with C. jejuni. Three out of 13 strains of C. jejuni isolated from sparrow feces showed quinolone resistance. From the frequent use of quinolones for treatment of industrial animals like chickens, pigs, and cows, the three strains of quinolone-resistant C. jejuni in sparrows must have been originated from those industrial animals. Sparrows that have quinolone-resistant C. jejuni were considered to have contacted with industrial animals or thier feed. It may be presumed, on the contrary, that C. jejuni in sparrows could be a potential source of contamination of broilers.
