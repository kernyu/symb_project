We present experimental procedures describing the creation of perforated patches by use of amphotericin B. In 13 different cellular preparations, access resistances below 10 M omega were achieved and with blunt electrode tips, access resistances of 3-4 M omega were possible. In addition to using the techniques to measure whole cell currents, we have used them to measure single channel currents in a new "outside-out patch" preparation and we have utilized them to measure the resting voltage of epithelial monolayers. We conclude that these new approaches can provide a substantial increase in versatility and quality for many kinds of electrophysiological measurements.
