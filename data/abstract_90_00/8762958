BACKGROUND: Resistance to antimonial drugs is rarely observed in immunocompetent patients. CASE REPORT: A 1-year-old girl was admitted suffering from persistent fever. A diagnosis of visceral leishmaniasis was made. The patient was given two courses of meglumine antimoniate (Glucantime) (60 mg/kg/d for 15 days) and one course of 12 injections of pentamidine (4 mg/kg). She relapsed 8 months later and failed to respond to Glucantime. Immunological tests performed during the relapse showed a suppression of the T cell response to Leishmania antigen and no production of interferon gamma. The patient was then successfully given liposomal amphotericin B (3 mg/kg/d for 10 days). She was asymptomatic 9 months later and had acquired specific cellular immunity against Leishmania. CONCLUSION: Deficient cell-mediated immunity and interferon gamma production are some factors responsible for decreased sensitivity to antimonial drugs. The WHO recommendations treating visceral leishmaniasis with prolonged administration of Glucantime may prevent relapses. Liposomal amphotericin B could be an alternative treatment.
