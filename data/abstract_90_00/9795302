Amoxicillin and clavulanic acid, combined in a 4:1 ratio, caused a significant (longer than 0.5 hours) postantibiotic effect (PAE) for the S. pneumoniae stains tested. These strains were from a different serotype (3, 6 and 9) and also had different susceptibility to penicillin. The duration of the PAE depended both on the strain and the amoxicillin/clavulanic acid concentration used. It is significant that for the serotype 9 strain, which was both penicillin and amoxicillin resistant, the duration of the PAE was between 1.5 and 2.2 hours. These results agree with those observed by other authors as to the effectiveness of amoxicillin/clavulanic acid against S.pneumoniae.
