Pyomyositis is a primary infection of skeletal muscle. We report the case of a previously healthy six-year-old who suffered from pyomyositis in the right lower back. He presented with lower back pain and low-grade fever for one week. After a series of laboratory and imaging studies, the diagnosis of right multifidus muscle pyomyositis with abscess formation was made. The patient recovered rapidly after incision and drainage therapy, accompanied by antibiotic treatment. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus was cultured from the abscess discharge. It was strongly suspected that herbal medicines and common cold medication the patient had been prescribed before admission to our hospital produced a masking effect that delayed the diagnosis.
