Susceptibility of 206 H. influenzae isolates was evaluated by disk diffusion method for 11 antimicrobial agents. No isolates were found to be resistant to third-generation cephalosporins, amoxicillin+clavulanic acid, gentamicin and ciprofloxacin. Four untypable isolates (1.9%) were beta-lactamase producing ampicillin-resistant; one of these was also resistant to chloramphenicol. The rate of resistance against rifampin was 0.5 percent.
