Currently, most of the subjects presenting with Plasmodium falciparum malaria in France come from areas where chloroquine resistance has already been reported. Treatment of uncomplicated malaria should consist of oral administration of either quinine or mefloquine or halofantrine. In children, halofantrine seems to be the treatment of choice at any age. The prognosis of cerebral malaria depends on how fast the diagnosis is made and the treatment is undertaken. The detection of clinical and biological risk factors is crucial. The treatment of cerebral malaria is based on quinine perfusion administered according to pharmacokinetic data.
