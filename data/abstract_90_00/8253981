A total of 374 clinical isolates of Enterococcus spp. were characterized to determine the species distribution and vancomycin resistance. The ability of the Vitek system (bioMerieux Inc, Hazelwood, St. Louis, Mo.) to identify enterococci to the species level and to recognize vancomycin resistance by using computer software version 7.1 was evaluated. Conventional methods were used for identification and agar dilution was used for susceptibility testing, the results of which were as follows (presented as number of vancomycin-resistant isolates/number of members of that species identified): 219/234 E. faecium, 9/112 E. faecalis, 2/3 E. mundtii, 0/1 E. durans, 0/1 E. hirae, 0/1 E. raffinosis, and 0/1 E. avium. Ten enterococci were in the vancomycin-intermediate category (six E. gallinarum, two E. casseliflavus, and one each of E. faecium and E. faecalis). The Vitek GPI card correctly identified 98% of E. faecium isolates, 99% of E. faecalis isolates, and only two isolates of other enterococcal species. The GPS-TA card was 98% sensitive and 95% specific for the detection of vancomycin resistance, generating a total of four very major (1.6%) and five minor errors (1.3%).
