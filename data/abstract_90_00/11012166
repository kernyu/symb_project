Transfer of drug resistance genes to hematopoietic cells is being studied as a means to protect against the myelosuppression associated with cancer chemotherapy and as a strategy for the in vivo selection and amplification of genetically modified cells. The goal of this study was to test if retroviral-mediated gene transfer of a dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) variant (L22Y) could be used for in vivo selection of transduced myeloid cells and to determine what proportion of transduced cells was required for protection from myelosuppression. Based on previous work suggesting that selection with antifolates may also require inhibition of nucleoside transport mechanisms, mice transplanted with DHFR-transduced bone marrow cells were treated with trimetrexate and the nucleoside transport inhibitor prodrug nitrobenzylmercaptopurine riboside phosphate. In vivo selection of transduced myeloid progenitors was seen in the bone marrow and in circulating mature peripheral blood cells following drug treatment. These results show that the novel combination of the L22Y-DHFR cDNA, trimetrexate and nitrobenzylmercaptopurine riboside phosphate can be used to select for transduced myeloid cells, and that this approach warrants further study in large animal models. A bicistronic vector containing a human CD24 reporter gene was used to determine the number of modified cells needed for chemoprotection. Partial protection from neutropenia was seen when greater than 10% of myeloid cells expressed the vector, and high levels of protection were obtained when the proportion exceeded 30%. These results suggest that gene transfer may be useful for myeloprotection in certain pediatric cancers, but that more efficient gene transfer will be required to apply this approach to adult cancer patients.
