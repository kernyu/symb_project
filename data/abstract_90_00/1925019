We describe the isolation and characterization of new mutants in the cell cycle of Escherichia coli. The mutants were selected as gain of function mutants that are able to maintain more than the normal number of chromosomes. Our increased ploidy mutants were isolated as resistant to camphor vapours, which selects for cells with more chromosomes than normal. The mutants (called mbr for moth-ball-resistant) map to four chromosomal locations: mbrA at 68 min; mbrB at 88.5 min; mbrC at 89.5 min; and mbrD at 90 min. To investigate the nature of these cell cycle mutants, we have coupled them with defects in recA, to test for induction of the SOS response, and dam, to determine if methylation is required for mbr function. Based on the results of these and other tests, we have made a preliminary placement of the mbr mutants within the context of the cell cycle. mbrA mutations appear to be defective in the coupling of the DNA replication cycle to the cell division cycle, and as such, may define a new link between the two processes. mbrB does not seem to be able to coordinate the cell cycle and the growth rate of the cell. mbrC appears to be defective in partitioning of chromosomes. mbrD, which may be allelic to rpoB (a subunit of RNA polymerase), appears to be defective in either chromosomal partitioning or the later stages of DNA replication.
