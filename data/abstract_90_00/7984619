The paper gives cytochemical findings of the lysosomal cationic system of neutrophilic granulocytes in the blood of 188 patients with various pulmonary tuberculoses. In infiltrative pulmonary tuberculosis which was first detected, the decrease in the activity of the lysosomal cationic system of neutrophils was adequate to the extent and severity of the process. The permanent increase in the antimicrobial potential of neutrophilic granulocytes in patients with fibrous and cavernous pulmonary tuberculosis is a defense response of the body, however with constantly progressive tuberculosis, there is inhibition of this defense system, which becomes an unfavourable sign. It can be assumed that the parameters of the activity of bactericidal systems in the neutrophilic granulocytes reflect, to a greater extent, both the activity of this system and the resistance of the whole body.
