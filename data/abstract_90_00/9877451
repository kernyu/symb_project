Little is known about the potential of immunomodulatory agents to lower tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) synthesis in tissues of nonmonocytic origin. We studied effects of diverse drugs on the formation of immunoreactive TNF-alpha in the human hepatoma cell lines HepG2 and Hep3B, in which TNF-alpha production was induced by treatment (3 h incubation periods) with interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta, 300 pg/ml) or phorbol myristate acetate (PMA, 100 nmol/l). TNF-alpha production in IL-1beta-stimulated or PMA-stimulated hepatocyte cultures was not altered following the addition of dihydrocortisone (< or = 1 microg/ml), dibutyryl-cAMP (db-cAMP, < or = 100 micromol/l), adenosine (< or = 1 mmol/l), thalidomide (< or = 25 microg/ml), or cyclosporine (< or = 300 ng/ml). TNF-alpha production was inhibited by taurolidine (> or = 300 microg/ml), but this inhibition was associated with reduced cell viability. Pentoxifylline (1 mg/ml) did not influence PMA-induced TNF-alpha production, but it augmented IL-1beta-induced TNF-alpha production. Measurements of TNF-alpha mRNA by RT-PCR indicated that pentoxifylline exerted its effect posttranscriptionally. Additional studies with PMA-treated human whole blood cultures confirmed that pentoxifylline, db-cAMP, and adenosine reduced TNF-alpha production by leukocytes. These results provide first evidence to assume cell type-specific effects of immunomodulatory drugs on TFN-alpha synthesis, which may be relevant with respect to their clinical application.
