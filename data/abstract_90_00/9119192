Candida albicans strain NCPF 3363 was isolated from a British patient with chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis (CMC) and confirmed to be resistant to azole antifungal compounds. In this study we investigate the molecular basis of resistance and show that azole tolerance in NCPF 3363 was associated with reduced intracellular accumulation of drug and not reduced affinity for the target site, as previously indicated. Relative impermeability or the presence of transporters related to those responsible for multidrug resistance are implicated in the mechanism of resistance.
