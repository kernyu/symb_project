We report the existence of high resistance to Melarsoprol and low resistance to Suramin in 11 Trypanosoma rhodesiense species. They were isolated from humans in the Tete province, Mozambique, and kept in mice at the Maputo National Health Institute. The preliminary results obtained with Suramin administered intracranially, are also reported.
