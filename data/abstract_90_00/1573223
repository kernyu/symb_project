Malaria is an old but still current parasitosis. Transmitted by the bite of the female anopheles, it can be revealed by more or less serious symptoms according to the species of Plasmodium. Plasmodium falciparum is responsible for the serious forms. It is the most frequent species, resistant to 4 amino-quinolein and sulfamides in some areas. P. vivax and P. ovale, usually harmless, are not so widely geographically spread as P. falciparum; and apparently are not drug resistant but they expose patients to the risk of relapses. During pregnancy, the choice of a curative and prophylactic therapy must take into account the supposed or confirmed species, the place of the stay and the duration of the exposure. On this case the authors call to mind the epidemiological criteria necessary for early diagnosis, the antimalarial drugs that can be used in pregnant women and draw attention to immuno-allergic and the classical secondary effects of quinine, which can also occur with chloroquine.
