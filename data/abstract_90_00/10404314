Glutaraldehyde-resistant Mycobacterium chelonae have been isolated from endoscope washer disinfectors and endoscope rinse water. The mechanism of glutaraldehyde resistance is not well understood. Two spontaneous, glutaraldehyde-resistant mutants of the sensitive type strain, NCTC 946, were investigated. The colony morphology of the two mutants differed from that of the the type strain: colonies of the former were dry and waxy whereas those of the latter were smooth and shiny. Increased resistance to glutaraldehyde of the mutants was matched by small increases in the MICs of rifampicin and ethambutol but not isoniazid. Both mutants showed increased surface hydrophobicity. No changes were identified in the extractable fatty acids or the mycolic acid components of the cell wall but a reduction in each of the resistant strains in the arabinogalactan/arabinomannan portion of the cell wall was detected.
