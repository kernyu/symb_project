In vitro activities of seven fluoroquinolones against 140 clinical Acinetobacter baumannii isolates representing 138 different strain types were determined. The rank order of activity was clinafloxacin > gatifloxacin > levofloxacin > trovafloxacin > gemifloxacin = moxifloxacin > ciprofloxacin. The 31 outbreak-related A. baumannii strains were significantly more resistant than were 109 sporadic strains.
