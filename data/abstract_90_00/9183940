Despite much recent progress, antiviral chemotherapy has still to meet some major challenges: residual cytotoxicity of much antiviral drugs; emergence of viral strains resisting to the most specific antiviral drugs; inability of the most active antiviral drugs to suppress latent viral infections. Several approaches using gene therapy (e.g. hybridons, ribozymes, or dominant negative mutants) might theoretically provide efficient solutions against viral latency.
