A total of 54 patients with culturally proven tropical dermatomycoses, comprising 23 with various types of dermatophytoses, one with foot infection due to Trichosporon beigelii and one with foot infection due to Geotrichum candidum, two with candidosis of the groin and 27 with pityriasis versicolor, were included in a clinical trial of efficacy of 1% isoconazole cream (Travogen, Schering, Berlin, Germany). Five patients were not evaluable. A clinical and mycological cure was achieved in 29 cases in 3-4 weeks. In 15 (31%) of the remaining patients treatment was required for 5-6 weeks, while another three patients required treatment for 8 weeks. In two patients the disease proved to be resistant to treatment with the drug.
