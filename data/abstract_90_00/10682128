Patients harbouring drug-resistance viruses usually suffer a rise in serum viraemia after a variable period of time. We have investigated the relationship between the appearance of resistant genotypes and the viral load of each patient after treatment. Our objective was to assess the association between human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) RNA plasma levels and the number of drug resistance-associated point mutations after treatment. A total of 150 patients from three reference centres in Spain (Madrid, Barcelona and Seville) from a previous study (Erase Study) were included. Patients had at that time undergone antiretroviral treatment with nucleoside analogues for at least 1 year (zidovudine/didanosine; zidovudine/zalcitabine; zidovudine/zalcitabine/lamivudine; zidovudine/didanosine/lamivudine). In this study, plasma viraemia in these patients was quantified and a line probe assay was used to determine the genotype of the virus. Viral load was significantly higher in patients harbouring virus with more than three mutations than in those individuals who harboured wild-type strains (P < 0.05). Surprisingly, when patients with viral load < 500 copies/ml (13/150) were analysed, only two carried wild-type strains, whereas three had virus with more than three point mutations. The viral load of six samples was assayed using an ultrasensitive test (detection limit < 20 copies/ml). Of the three samples where viral load was < 20 copies/ml, one patient harboured wild-type virus, whereas two carried mutant virus strains. These results suggest that even in patients with undetectable viral loads by conventional methods, viral replication may continue and mutations develop. Therefore, standard values of plasma viraemia for measuring the effectiveness of the treatment should be reconsidered when patients are on antiviral regimens of just two or three nucleoside analogues.
