10/84 strains (11.9%) of Neisseria meningitidis isolated from blood and/or cerebrospinal fluid in children 1986-1987 had reduced sensitivity to benzylpenicillin (MICs 0.1-0.4 mg/l). Group C meningococci predominated among these strains. The clinical course was satisfactory in all cases regardless of the antibiotic treatment used, although the time to abatement of fever was prolonged compared to that of children infected with susceptible strains.
