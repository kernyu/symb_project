From the results of recently-published in-vitro studies, we have reviewed the activities of novel quinolones which are currently available, either commercially or for investigative purposes, against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the atypical mycobacteria (principally the Mycobacterium avium complex, Mycobacterium chelonae, Mycobacterium xenopi, Mycobacterium marinum and Mycobacterium fortuitum) and Mycobacterium leprae. We have also evaluated the effects of the various methods for determining the susceptibilities of the mycobacteria on the in-vitro activities of these agents. Sparfloxacin, Win-57273, ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin were the most active agents overall. The in-vitro activities, efficacies in animal models, tissue and cell penetration and results of preliminary clinical investigations suggest that some of the newer quinolones might be effective alternatives to standard anti-tuberculous agents for the treatment of patients with infections caused by mycobacteria, particularly when there is resistance to the latter group of drugs.
