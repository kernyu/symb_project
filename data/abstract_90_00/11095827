The incidence of infection with multidrug-resistant or pan-resistant gram-positive bacteria has drastically limited or eliminated the conventional antimicrobial options available to clinicians. Quinupristin-dalfopristin, a unique parenteral streptogramin that lacks cross-resistance with other antimicrobials, has shown clinical efficacy against many of these important bacteria. This review focuses on quinupristin-dalfopristin"s mechanism of action, in vitro spectrum of activity, clinical efficacy and toxicity, and likely future role in the management of serious gram-positive infections.
