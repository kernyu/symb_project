The genes crucially determining the therapeutic response of chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML) to interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) are unknown. Recently, two independent IFN-alpha signalling pathways were identified: the classic pathway mediates induction of 2'-5' oligoadenylate synthetase (2-5 OAS), p68 kinase and IFN regulatory factor-2 (IRF-2), whereas the alternate pathway leads to activation of IFN regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1). We investigated whether deficient or imbalanced expression of components of these two pathways is associated with resistance of CML cells to antiproliferative action of IFN alpha/beta. Constitutive and IFN-induced transcript levels of IFN-dependent genes in mononuclear cells, granulocytes, monocytes, lymphocytes and CD34+ cells of chronic-phase CML and blast crisis patients were assessed by Northern blot techniques and were correlated with subsequent clinical responses to IFN therapy. Our results demonstrated that IFN-alpha or -beta treatment in vitro and in vivo leads to an enhanced expression of IRF-1, IRF-2. RNase L, p68 and 2-5 OAS which was independent of the degree of cellular differentiation and clonal evolution of CML. Neither the magnitude of induction of these genes nor the IRF-1/IRF-2 mRNA balance differed between chronic-phase CML patients responding or failing IFN-alpha therapy. These results indicate that failure of IFN-alpha treatment is not due to defects in mRNA induction of the above-mentioned candidate genes for the direct antiproliferative response to IFN type I.
