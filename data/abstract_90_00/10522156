Thioridazine (Th), which is therapeutically used in psychiatric patients, was found to possess conspicuous antimicrobial activity when tested against 316 strains belonging to a number of Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria. Although Staphylococcus aureus, Vibrio chloerae and V. parahaemolyticus were found to be most sensitive, Th was highly bactericidal against S. aureus and bacteriostatic for vibrios and other Gram negative organisms. In the study of antiplasmid/curing effect of Th on twelve multiply antibiotic and Th resistant bacteria, it was observed that elimination of R plasmids was facilitated by choice of optimal concentration of Th. Significant elimination of single and combined antibiotic resistance occurred in E. coli and Shigella flexneri and not in S. aureus.
