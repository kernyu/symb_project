The object of the study was a strain of Streptomyces hygroscopicus producing bialaphos, an antibiotic used as a herbicide, which is promising and ecologically safe. Molecular cloning of a bialaphos resistance gene (bar) was performed in the recipient strain, S. lividans TK64, within the 2.0-kb DNA fragment with the plasmid pIJ699. Introduction of a bar gene into another strain producing bialaphos, i.e. S. viridochromogenus Tu494, led to its higher constitutive resistance to bialaphos. The results confirmed the data on different regulation of bar (S. hygroscopicus) and pat (S. virido-chromogenus) resistance genes.
