For the treatment of atopic dermatitis, a variety of therapies are used including folk medicine. At present, there is no single treatment which is effective to cure the symptoms of atopic dermatitis completely in all patients. We are drawing attention to the high isolation rate of Staphylococcus aureus when starting disinfectant treatment combined with topical steroid therapies for the purpose of killing S. aureus. As a result, we examined many patients in whom almost a complete remission was obtained even after short periods of therapy, though it had been difficult to obtain improvement by conventional treatments. In many patients, IgE values and reagin antibody titer decrease dramatically soon after starting treatment. As a disinfectant, 10% povidone-iodine solution was used. We investigated also the effect of iodine contained in the povidone-iodine solution on the thyroid gland.
