OBJECTIVE: To document the incidence of high-level gentamicin resistance (HLGR) in enterococcal isolates at Johannesburg Hospital. DESIGN: Survey of laboratory isolates. SETTING: Academic hospitals. BACTERIAL STRAINS: Consecutive samples of enterococcal isolates. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The incidence of HLGR in enterococcal isolates. RESULTS: The incidence of HLGR was 26.5% of Enterococcus faecalis isolates and 20% of E. faecium isolates grown during the study period. CONCLUSIONS: High-level gentamicin resistance is common among enterococci isolated at Johannesburg Hospital, and this observation must be considered in defining strategies for the management of invasive enterococcal infections in the future.
