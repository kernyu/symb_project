Sixteen multiple drug resistant strains of Salmonella typhi belonging to Vi-phage types E1 (14) and O (2) and isolated in Southeast India in 1991 were characterized. All strains were resistant to chloramphenicol and the majority to trimethoprim and ampicillin. In all strains these resistances were encoded by plasmids of the H1 incompatibility group with molecular weights ranging from 110 to 120 megadaltons. Physicians in European countries should be aware that treatment may fail if patients with typhoid fever who have recently returned from the Indian sub-continent are given first-line treatment with chloramphenicol, trimethoprim or ampicillin. With the possible exception of young children, ciprofloxacin is currently the best choice for treatment of such patients.
