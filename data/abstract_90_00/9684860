Piericidin is a potent inhibitor of the mitochondrial and bacterial type I NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductases (Complex I) and is considered to bind at or close to the ubiquinone binding site(s) of the enzyme. Piericidin-resistant mutants of the bacterium Rhodobacter capsulatus have been isolated and the present work demonstrates that a single missense mutation at the level of the gene encoding the peripheral 49-kDa/NUOD subunit of Complex I is definitely associated with this resistance. Based on this original observation, we propose a model locating the binding site for piericidin (and quinone) at the interface between the hydrophilic and hydrophobic domains of Complex I.
