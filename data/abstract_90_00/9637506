Activation of cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) by TNF has been shown to be an important component of the signaling pathway leading to cell death. The role of cPLA2 in the cytotoxic action of TNF was investigated in a panel of human leukemic cell lines. TNF could activate cPLA2 only in U937 and HL60 TNF-sensitive leukemic cells, but not in KG1a, CEM, and CEM/VLB100 cells that are relatively resistant to TNF. Pretreatment with 4-bromophenacyl bromide, a cPLA2 inhibitor, rendered U937 and HL60 cell lines resistant to the cytotoxic effect of TNF. Immunoblot and reverse-transcriptase PCR demonstrated that cPLA2 expression was detectable at both transcriptional and translational levels in all leukemic cell lines studied, although CEM and CEM/VLB100 cells expressed cPLA2 mRNA and protein at lower levels. The protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide, increased TNF-induced cPLA2 activity and cytotoxicity in both CEM and CEM/VLB100 cell lines. Low levels of cPLA2 activity in the KG1a cell line could be activated by the cPLA2 activator mellitin, or the calcium ionophore A23187. The data suggest that cPLA2 activity is involved in TNF-induced cytotoxicity in leukemic cells. Resistance to TNF-induced cytotoxicity may involve either protein inhibitors that act upstream of cPLA2 in the TNF-signaling pathway or constitutive defects of cPLA2 itself, possibly involving calcium utilization.
