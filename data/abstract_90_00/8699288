The ability of many different species of bacteria to resist the inhibitory action of antimicrobial agents has become a global problem. As the magnitude of the problem continues to increase, it is imperative that healthcare professionals, particularly nurses who administer antimicrobial agents on a daily basis, become familiar with the causes of antibiotic resistance and the ways in which the emergence of resistance can be prevented or minimized. It also is important that the proper use of antimicrobial agents and the problems associated with misuse be conveyed to patients receiving intravenous therapy, particularly those receiving therapy outside of traditional healthcare settings. This article will highlight some of the factors leading to the development of resistance in bacteria and the problems facing the medical community and the public regarding the spread of resistant bacteria in hospital and community settings.
