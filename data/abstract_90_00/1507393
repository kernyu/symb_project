Since methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is resistant to multiple antibiotics, only a limited number of antibacterial agents shows efficacy against this bacteria. Therefore, combination therapy is often attempted for MRSA infections. Most of the MRSA strains recently isolated, however, have been found to show very high resistance, and some of the antibiotics which had previously been effective have been failing to produce good responses in increasing numbers of patients. Thus, the drugs used for combination therapy in MRSA infections need to be reevaluated. We assessed the bacteriological efficacy of cefotiam (CTM) plus minocycline (MINO) therapy against MRSA in an in vitro system (CTM shows relatively strong antibacterial activities against MRSA with moderate resistance, and MINO shows strong antibacterial activities against highly resistant MRSA. 1. Against MINO-susceptible MRSA strains, CTM + MINO demonstrated potent antibacterial activities at MINO concentrations of MIC or sub-MIC levels, irrespective of the MIC of CTM against MRSA strains being tested. 2. Against MINO-resistant MRSA strains (strains for which MICs of MINO exceeded the upper limit of the clinically expected plasma MINO level), CTM + MINO showed no significant antibacterial activity. These results suggested that the effect of this combination was dependent on the antibacterial activity of MINO. Therefore, the usefulness of this combination in patients with MRSA infections can be predicted based on susceptibilities of involved strains to MINO. 3. The potent antibacterial effect of this combination against MINO-susceptible MRSA strains was considered to be the result of damage to the cellular membrane by MINO and the subsequent antibiotic effect of CTM.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
