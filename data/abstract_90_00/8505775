Plasmodium falciparum susceptibility to chloroquine was investigated in 10 areas of Burkina Faso in the rainy seasons in 1990-1991. The 7-days in-vivo test was carried out from August to November on children aged 2-8 years with monospecific P. falciparum infection (asexual parasitaemia > 800 microliters-1 of blood), axillary temperature < 37.5 degrees C, and a negative Bergqvist urine test for 4-aminoquinolines. Among 2190 children screened, 366 were selected. Blood samples were collected on days 0, 2, 4 and 7 by finger-prick, and 100 microscopic fields of thick and thin smears were examined for parasite density and species identification. Chloroquine was given under supervision at the standard dose of 25 mg kg-1 over three days (days 0, 1 and 2) with an observation period of one hour after treatment. Parasitaemia did not clear in 63 cases (17.2%) with a 13.4% RII response and 3.8% RIII response. The results do not seem to indicate a decline in the sensitivity of P. falciparum to chloroquine in Burkina Faso during the past two years.
