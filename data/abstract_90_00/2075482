A double-blind comparative study of Fanismef-mefloquine/sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine (MSP) and Lariam-mefloquine (MEF) for the treatment of falciparum malaria, was carried out at malaria clinics in Kanchanaburi, in western Thailand, in the years 1987 and 1988. The cure rates obtained were 96% for the MSP group and 93% for the MEF and there was no significant difference. Vomiting and diarrhea were common side effects in both the MSP and MEF groups. Less common side effects were epigastric pain, minor skin rashes and dizziness. Significant differences in vomiting and epigastric pain only occurred in the patients who did not have these symptoms before treatment: vomiting MSP 23%, MEF 8%, epigastric pain MSP 22% and MEF 11%.
