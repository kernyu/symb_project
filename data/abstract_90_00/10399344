Plaunotol was tested for possible antibacterial activity against twenty strains of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and fourteen strains of methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA) which had been isolated from the skin of patients with atopic dermatitis under growth-promoting conditions. Plaunotol was effective against all strains tested. The dose of plaunotol for 50% inhibition of growth (ID50) ranged from 2.5 to 16 micrograms/ml for strains of MRSA and from 2.5 to 7.0 micrograms/ml for those of MSSA. These results suggest that plaunotol may be useful in the prevention of infection by MRSA and in skin care for patients with atopic dermatitis.
