The unilateral follicular conjunctivitis with corneal marginal infiltrates represents a clinical picture typical for two different types of bacteria: chlamydiae may cause a keratoconjunctivitis always combined with urethritis or colpitis; on the other hand staphylococci may be the reason for the same clinical features, whereas the marginal corneal infiltrates are caused in these cases by immunological reactions to the bacterial toxins. After harvesting material for bacterial investigations or direct immunofluorescence test for the detection of chlamydial antigen, 2-3 days are necessary until the results of the examinations are ready. From January 1991 until the end of 1991 a total of 60 patients with the diagnosis of chlamydial infection underwent ophthalmological investigations at our outpatient clinic. In our study we compared the efficacy and safety of topical tetracyclines and 0.3% norfloxacin solution in the treatment of chlamydial keratoconjunctivitis. Within the bacterial genus, staphylococci (S. aureus, S. epidermidis and S. saprophyticus) were the most frequently isolated organisms (60%). Nearly one third of the staphylococci were resistant to tetracyclines. Therefore there are two indications to postulate norfloxacin as a practicable alternative: at the beginning of therapy until the results of the bacterial investigation are available and in the case of persisting bacterial superinfection.
