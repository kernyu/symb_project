A comparison was made between the blood schizontocidal action in mice of racemic mefloquine hydrochloride and the free bases of its (+)- and (-)-enantiomers (Ro 13-7224 and Ro 13-7225) against chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium yoelii ssp. NS. The racemic hydrochloride was two to three times as active against this parasite in mice as either of the enantiomer free bases, which were of similar activity to each other. Under drug selection pressure, the parasites acquired resistance in approximately the same time for each of the three compounds.
