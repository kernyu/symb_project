We have previously demonstrated using immunocytochemical, histochemical, and biochemical techniques that ischemia in vivo and ATP depletion in vitro result in dissociation of Na(+)-K(+)-adenosinetriphosphatase (ATPase) from the actin cytoskeleton and redistribution to the apical domain in renal proximal tubule cells. To directly evaluate whether apical Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase retained Na+ pumping activity, a rapidly reversible model of cellular ATP depletion in confluent LLC-PK1 cells grown on semipermeable membranes was utilized. Tight-junction integrity, monitored by electrical resistance, was lost during ATP depletion and reestablished during 2 h of ATP repletion. Total cellular Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase activity and total surface membrane [3H]ouabain binding remained constant, but specific apical [3H]ouabain binding increased (7 vs. 26 fmol/filter, P < 0.01). Apical [3H]ouabain binding returned to baseline during 5 h of ATP repletion. Apically applied ouabain was then used to selectively inhibit apical Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase. It had no effect on apical-to-basolateral Na+ flux under physiological conditions (1.3 +/- 0.61 vs. 1.27 +/- 0.46 meq.filter-1.30 min-1), but it increased the apical-to-basolateral flux in ATP-depleted and then repleted monolayers (0.39 +/- 0.12 vs. 0.83 +/- 0.27 meq.filter-1.30 min-1, P < 0.01), implying that apical Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase retained Na+ pumping activity. Together, these data imply that ATP depletion induces loss of surface membrane polarity resulting in redistribution of functional proteins to the alternate domain.
