Teicoplanin, a new glycopeptide antibiotic similar to vancomycin, was evaluated in treating 36 hospitalized patients suffering from various Gram-positive infections. The 36 patients received teicoplanin once daily as a mean intravenous injection of 550 mg/day (range 200-800 mg/day). Previous antimicrobial therapy was used in 28% of patients. The mean duration of therapy was 7.5 days (range 3-38 days). The overall clinical success rate was 94%. 24/36 patients (66%) had positive microbiology. Elimination of the pathogens was seen in 75% of all evaluable cases. Four patients with early prosthetic valve endocarditis due to coagulase negative Staphylococcus (3 patients) and Propionibacterium acnes (1 patient) had a favorable clinical and microbiological outcome. No adverse drug reactions were observed. Teicoplanin is safe and effective in the therapy of many different infections caused by Gram-positive bacteria.
