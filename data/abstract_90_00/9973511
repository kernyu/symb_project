Astrocytes are a major cellular component of the brain that are capable of intense proliferation and metabolic activity during diverse inflammatory brain diseases (such as multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's dementia, tumor, HIV encephalitis, or prion disease). In this biological process, called reactive gliosis, astrocyte apoptosis is frequently observed and could be an important mechanism of regulation. However, the factors responsible for apoptosis in human astrocytes are poorly defined. Here, we report that short term cultured astrocytes derived from different brain regions express significant levels of CD95 at their surface. Only late passage astrocytes are sensitive to CD95 ligation using either CD95 mAb or recombinant CD95 ligand. Blocking experiments using caspase inhibitors with different specificities (DEVD-CHO, z-VAD-fmk, and YVAD-cmk), an enzymatic activity assay, and immunoblotting show that CPP32/caspase-3 play a prominent role in CD95-induced astrocyte death. In contrast, early passage astrocytes are totally resistant to death, but a significant increase in astrocytic IL-8 secretion (p < 0.001, by Wilcoxon's test for paired samples) is observed after CD95 triggering. Production of IL-8 contributes to the resistance of astrocytes to CD95 ligation. Furthermore, in the presence of IFN-gamma, resistant astrocytes became sensitive to CD95-mediated death. These data suggest that microenvironmental factors can influence the consequences of CD95 ligation on astrocytes. Therefore, we propose that CD95 expressed by human astrocytes plays a pivotal role in the regulation of astrocyte life and death and may be a key factor in inflammatory processes in the brain, such as reactive gliosis.
