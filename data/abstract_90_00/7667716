A survey on the use of antibiotics in surgical prophylaxis was carried out in seven Malaysian hospitals. Details of antibiotic prescriptions were obtained through questionnaires completed by the prescriber. A total of 430 such prescriptions was analysed. A large number of different antibiotic regimens were used for a variety of surgical procedures. The majority of prescriptions (70%) were issued for procedures where such prophylaxis was probably not necessary. Antibiotics were also often prescribed for durations that were longer than necessary. There is an urgent need to educate surgeons and standardize surgical prophylactic regimens in order to reduce cost and combat the emergence of antibiotic resistance.
