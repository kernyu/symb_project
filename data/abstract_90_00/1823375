An effect of Na2EDTA and tetracycline (oxytetracycline and doxycycline) resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was tested. The strains were isolated from clinical specimens. The tests were performed in vitro by serial dilutions of the drugs in liquid medium. MIC for Na2EDTA, tetracyclines and a combination of Na2EDTA and tetracyclines was determined. It was shown that the combination of oxytetracycline or doxycycline with Na2EDTA caused changes in sensitivity of Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa resistant to these antibiotics. After an application of the mixture of various concentrations of tetracycline and Na2EDTA it was observed that, with the reduction of the effective Na2EDTA dose by about half, the lowest concentrations of tetracyclines inhibiting the growth of resistant bacteria were 2-64 times lower than MIC values of antibiotics without Na2EDTA.
