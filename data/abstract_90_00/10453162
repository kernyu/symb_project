Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus from nasal discharge was identified in 37 (2.5%) cardiovascular patients operated between 1995 and 1997; 25 male and 12 female, ranging from 1 to 83 years (mean 63); 2 were excluded because of Arbekacin or Isodine-gel treatment. The first 17 were treated with Vancomycin inhalation (V group) and eradication was considered to have been achieved when 3 consecutive negative cultures were obtained; the subsequent 18 were treated with Mupirocin (M group) and eradication was determined by 1 negative culture. In post-eradication electively operated 13 V and 15 M, postoperative MRSA infection was observed in one M (wound infection); the interval from the first nasal culture to the operation was 68 +/- 58 in V and 32 +/- 12 days in M, respectively (p < 0.05). In the remaining 7 who had to undergo emergency surgery while waiting for eradication because of progression of symptoms (2 V) or prior to instituting treatment (2 V, and 3 M), postoperative MRSA infection was observed in 2 M (both pneumonia). No deaths from infection were observed. Though the time required for conversion of the nasal culture was longer in V (13 +/- 20) than in M (7 +/- 1 days) differences were not significant. Mupirocin is easier to use, eradication can be achieved generally within a week.
