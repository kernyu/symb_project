Within the framework of a national multicentric study between 1989 and 1992, 118 strains of betalactamase producing Haemophilus influenzae were isolated. Biotyping demonstrated the predominance of biotypes I, II and III, with 22, 36 and 24% of the strains, respectively. Encapsulated strains accounted for 13% of the total; all, but one, were serotype b. The antimicrobial susceptibility test (dilution method) of the 118 ampicillin--resistant strains showed: 33.9% resistance to tetracycline, 29.7% to chloramphenicol, 10.2% to erythromycin, 9.3% to trimethoprim, 0.8% to rifampicin, and 29.7% of multiresistance. All strains were susceptible to augmentin, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone and ceprofloxacin. Ninety strains were screened for resistant plasmids. A large plasmid (30-50 Mdal) was isolated in 38.9% of the strains and a small plasmid (3-4.4 Mdal) in 10%. No plasmid was found in 51% of the strains. Isoelectric focusing of 54 beta-lactamases showed that all were type TEM-1 (pI = 5.4), with the exception of one, which was type TEM-2 (pI = 5.6).
