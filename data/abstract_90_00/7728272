Various aspects of ionizing radiation action on microorganisms and course of endo- and exogenous infections are considered. The immune response is discussed from the standpoint of its significance in development of infectious-inflammatory processes under conditions of radiation of a microorganism and higher radiation background. Quantitative and functional changes in the immune system of the organism subjected to radiation are discussed in detail and peculiarities of these changes under low doses of radiation are shown. The analysis of the data obtained has confirmed a decrease of the natural resistance of organism to various infectious agents of endo- and exogenous origin under the effect of ionizing radiation; the main reason of that is disturbance of the immunity system, particularly at the cellular level.
