The network of genes which mediates multiple drug resistance in yeast includes, among others, the PDR1 gene, which encodes a putative regulator of gene expression, and PDR5, a locus whose amplification leads to resistance. We demonstrate that disruption of PDR5 causes marked hypersensitivity not only to cycloheximide but also to sulphometuron methyl and the mitochondrial inhibitors chloramphenicol, lincomycin, erythromycin and antimycin. Genetic analysis of double mutants containing an insertion in PDR5 (pdr5:Tn5), which renders cells hypersensitive to cycloheximide, and a pdr1 mutation, which confers resistance to this inhibitor, indicates that the expression of resistance requires a functional PDR5 gene. The same interdependency is observed for chloramphenicol, but not for oligomycin, lincomycin, erythromycin or sulphometuron methyl. Northern analysis of PDR1 and PDR5 transcripts reveals that the 5.2 kbp PDR5 transcript is overexpressed in pdr1 (resistant) mutants, but underexpressed in a disruption of PDR1. These observations provide strong experimental support for our former proposal that the PDR5 gene is a target for regulation by the PDR1 gene product.
