Two cases of acute coalescent mastoiditis with subperiosteal abscess are presented. Cultures from both abscesses resulted in bacteria resistant to commonly prescribed oral antibiotics. Historical perspectives on acute mastoiditis as well as the emergence of multi-drug resistant bacteria will be discussed. Current diagnostic evaluation and effective therapy for acute mastoiditis will also be reviewed.
