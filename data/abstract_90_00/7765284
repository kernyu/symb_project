Oryzacystatin (OC) is a proteinaceous cysteine proteinase inhibitor involved in the biodefense of rice seeds. To create transgenic rice plants with increased OC activity, we introduced an OC expressing vector into rice protoplasts and obtained transformed calli. The expression vector contained a bacterial inaA DNA fragment in the 3'-noncoding region as a tag to distinguish the introduced DNA from the intrinsic OC gene. The OC vector and a selection marker gene conferring hygromycin resistance were used together to transfect into rice protoplasts. A number of hygromycin-resistant calli were obtained and studied by polymerase chain reaction and genomic Southern blotting to find if the exogenous OC gene had been integrated. The calli were studied by northern blotting as well to examine mRNA expression. The results showed that integration and expression of the introduced OC gene occurred in 51% and 27%, respectively, of 156 subcultures from 15 hygromycin-resistant calli. As a final step, transgenic rice plants were regenerated from the calli expressing OC. Leaves and seeds from the plants had higher OC activities than those from nontransgenic plants.
