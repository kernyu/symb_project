The search for new antimalarial drugs is important for many reasons, specially because of the resistance of plasmodia. Some clinical and laboratory studies have recently indicated that quinolones, currently in use for treatment of bacterial infections, have antimalarial activity. So, we evaluated the possible action of ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin and pefloxacin in mice experimentally infected by Plasmodium berghei, by the oral route. Taking into account parasitemia and mortality, we came to conclusion that these drugs are not effective, as judged by the methods used.
