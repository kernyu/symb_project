We studied 122 stool samples collected from 25 patients with hematologic malignancies who received prophylactic norfloxacin. Fecal samples were obtained at admission and twice weekly thereafter during prophylaxis. Fluoroquinolone-resistant Escherichia coli strains were isolated from the feces of 10 (40%) of the patients; two patients had fluoroquinolone-resistant E. coli strains prior to beginning norfloxacin treatment, and in the other eight patients, the strains appeared subsequently. One patient developed fluoroquinolone-resistant E. coli bacteremia after 10 days of norfloxacin administration.
