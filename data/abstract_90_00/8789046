The macrolide-azilide susceptibility testing (agar dilution, disk diffusion, Etest) criteria for 105 Neisseria gonorrhoeae strains were evaluated. In addition, the potencies of azithromycin, clarithromycin, and erythromycin were studied. The most active macrolide-azilide agent was azithromycin (MIC at which 90% of the isolates are inhibited [MIC90], 0.5 microgram/ml) compared with clarithromycin (MIC90, 1.5 to 2 micrograms/ml) and erythromycin (MIC90, 2 to 4 micrograms/ml). The Etest (AB Biodisk, Solna, Sweden) was observed to produce MIC results very similar to those of the reference agar dilution test (GC agar base), with 100% of the results within 1 log2 dilution step of the reference MICs. The disk diffusion test zone diameters for all three drugs correlated at an acceptable level (r = -0.81 to -0.92) with the reference agar dilution MICs. Interpretive criteria for susceptibility were proposed for azithromycin at a MIC of < or = 2 micrograms/ml and a disk diffusion test zone of > or = 25 mm. No category for resistance was proposed because of the paucity of strains for which MICs were > 2 micrograms/ml. These tentative criteria should be further validated by correlations with clinical trial data for gonococcal strains (as they emerge) that have azithromycin MICs above the proposed susceptible category range.
