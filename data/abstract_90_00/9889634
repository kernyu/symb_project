The article presents information gained from a survey among Norwegian hospitals in March 1997 concerning their treatment of infections with Helicobacter pylori. Altogether 52 hospitals answered the questionnaire. A combination of proton pump inhibitors, metronidazole and clarithromycin was used by 59% as first choice and urea quick test (94%) and urea breath test (42%) as the primary diagnostic procedures, whereas serology was in little use (17%). Besides ordinary ulcer disease, indications for treatment were: ulcer induced by non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs (79%), gastrooesophageal reflux (37%), non-ulcer dyspepsia (14%) and cancer prophylaxis (14%). The gastro group at the Department of Pharmacotherapeutics at the University of Oslo invited specialists from all health regions to discuss indications for treatment of H pylori, the diagnosis and the role of general practitioners. The extensive use of clarithromycin might be doubtful due to development of resistance. Indications for treatment of H pylori other than ulcer disease and mucosa associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma are still uncertain. Uncritical use of serological tests in primary care should be discouraged. At present there is no uniform strategy for the diagnosis and treatment of H pylori infection, and a coordinated strategy between general practitioners and specialists is needed.
