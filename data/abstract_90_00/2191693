The beta-lactamase types present in 75 ampicillin and carbenicillin resistant E. coli were characterized using isoelectric focusing (IEF). The strains were isolated from patients with urinary tract infections from two geographically different areas of Denmark: 38 strains from Copenhagen and 37 strains from North Jutland. For 19 of the strains from Copenhagen and 18 of the strains from North Jutland, their beta-lactamase activity against nitrocefin and ampicillin, carbenicillin, benzylpenicillin, cloxacillin and cephaloridine was examined by a micro-iodometric and an UV-spectrophotometric assay. The strains from Copenhagen showed greater activity (p less than 0.001) against nitrocefin than the strains from North Jutland. The rate of hydrolysis of ampicillin was greater for the strains from Copenhagen than for the strains from North Jutland. Ninety-three per cent of the strains produced plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases, of which the most prevalent, TEM-1, was produced by 97 per cent of these strains, and OXA-1 by 3 per cent.
