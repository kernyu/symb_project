Actinomycetoma is a chronic disease that affects subcutaneous tissue. We present a case of a patient with abdominal actinomycetoma caused by Nocardia brasiliensis resistant to different treatments over several years, who also presented phagocyte immunodeficiency. He received two cycles (23 day cycles) of cefotaxime, 1 g every 8-h, and amikacin, 500 mg every 12 hours. Immunomodulation was carried out with levamisole 300 mg per week, during 4 weeks and bacterial antigen (at a concentration of 600,000,000 bacteria per mL), twice for a week during 20 months. The importance of susceptibility testing and immunological function investigation in this type of patients is discussed.
