Two oxazolidinones (U100592 and U100766), trovafloxacin, and a streptogramin combination (dalfopristin-quinupristin) were highly active in vitro against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, including methicillin-resistant strains. Trovafloxacin was more active than ciprofloxacin. Time-kill synergy studies demonstrated indifference for the oxazolidinones combined with vancomycin and rifampin against methicillin-resistant staphylococci. Spontaneous resistance was observed with all agents.
