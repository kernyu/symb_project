In Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium ovale malaria, some of the liver stage parasites remain dormant. The activation of these dormant forms (called hypnozoite) can give rise to relapse weeks, months or years after the initial infection. To prevent relapses, a course of primaquine may be given as terminal prophylaxis to patients. Different strains of Plasmodium vivax vary in their sensitivity to primaquine and, recently, cases of relapse of Plasmodium vivax after this standard primaquine therapy were reported from various countries. We reported a case of primaquine resistant malaria which initially was thought to be relapsed caused by loss of terminal prophylaxis.
