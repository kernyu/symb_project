The protein-D2 porin of Pseudomonas aeruginosa is lacking in carbapenem or fluoroquinolone-resistant strains and hence was thought to facilitate the diffusion of these antibiotics. We examined the effect of several antibiotics on the single channel conductivity of protein-D2 in planar lipid bilayers and found that fluoroquinolones and carbapenems at concentrations of around 1 mM caused closure of the protein-D2 channel. Tetracycline, ampicillin, piperacillin, and latamoxef did not exert any detectable effect on the protein-D2 channel activity.
