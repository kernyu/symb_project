Investigations were carried on with model cream with O/W and W/O emulsion type and three selected tooth pastes produced by Pollena-Lechia. Own "conservation test" was applied for a period of 28 days basing on methods recommended by PN-80/C-77022 for cosmetics. Applied test microorganisms were recommended by National Institute of Hygiene for investigation of disinfecting agents and strains of bacteria and fungi isolated from cosmetics. Initial level of contamination amounted to 10(6) cells/g. Following biocides were used: Nipagin A, M and P, Kathon CG, Sepicide Cl, Chlor-hexidine gluconate, Myacide SP, Bromochlorophene, Germall 115, Gropol, benzalkonium bromide, Cetrimide, Irgasan DP-300 and Bronopol. Most effective biocides for creams with W/O emulsion type effective during 5 days were Gropol and Bronopol in concentration of 0.01% and Kathon CG in concentration of 0.05%. For tooth pastes optimal biocide was Sepicide Cl in concentration of 0.3% which was cidal in time of 4 days. Out of tested microorganisms most resistant to mentioned biocides were Pseudomonas aeruginosa i P. putida isolated from cosmetic creams.
