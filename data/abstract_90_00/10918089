Given the current concern about multiresistance to drugs in tuberculosis, the data from a large study in two different centers are presented. At the Hospital Universitario Reina Sofia de Cordoba 71,359 clinical isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis were processed and at the Centro de Referencia de Micobacterias 2,350 cultures were studied. The percentage of total multiresistance at the Hospital Universitario was 6&#37; from 1996-1998, and 6.7&#37; at the Centro de Referencia in 1998. Although these figures are high, they are lower than in previous years and could indicate the beginning of a decreasing trend, following years of increasing in the 1990s.
