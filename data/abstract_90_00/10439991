In order to prevent the spread of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), the epidemiology of this micro-organism must be defined. The prevalence of colonization with VRE in various population groups in Berlin was investigated and the risk factors associated with VRE colonization assessed. In a cross-sectional study, rectal swabs were taken from seven population groups (healthy students, outpatients, home nursing patients, normal care and critical care patients of a community hospital and university hospital). Every one completed a questionnaire (age, gender, previous hospital stays, antibiotic therapy). Rectal swabs were examined for the presence of normal gut flora and VRE. All VRE isolates were typed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). VRE colonization prevalence ranged from 0.9% (students) to 4.2% (nursing-home patients) in non-hospitalized subjects; in hospitalized patients prevalence ranged from 1.8% (regular care ward of a community hospital) to 16.3% (ICU patients of a university hospital). Location (university hospital, OR = 3.5) and age (> or = 60 years, OR = 2.2) were independent risk factors for VRE colonization. Within one population group, isolates with identical PFGE patterns were found in up to three people; one strain was found in four subjects belonging to different groups. Our findings suggest that VRE are imported from the community into hospitals with subsequent spread within the institution.
