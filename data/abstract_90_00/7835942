Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) is known to play a major role in resistance to Salmonella typhimurium infection. In this study, the IFN-gamma production in spleens of mice infected with S. typhimurium was analysed at the single cell level using an ELISPOT method. The in vivo IFN-gamma production during the early phase of infection with virulent and avirulent S. typhimurium strains was examined in four mouse strains. Data show that infection with a virulent strain of S. typhimurium caused a much greater enhancement in the frequency of IFN-gamma-producing cells in innately resistant (ltyr) mice (CBA and DBA/2) than in susceptible (ltys) mice (C57BL/6 and BALB/c). In contrast, infection with an avirulent strain of S. typhimurium induced a clear increase in the number of IFN-gamma-producing cells in susceptible mice which was even greater than in resistant ones. These results indicate that both the host genetic background and bacterial virulence play a critical role in the regulation of IFN-gamma production during the early phase of S. typhimurium infection.
