Quantitative susceptibility testing of clinical isolates of streptomycin-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis demonstrated that there is a close correlation between the molecular resistance mechanism and the in vitro activity of streptomycin: mutations in rpsL were mainly associated with high-level resistance, mutations in rrs were associated with an intermediate level of resistance, and streptomycin-resistant isolates with wild-type rpsL and rrs exhibited a low-level resistance phenotype. Investigations of streptomycin-resistant isolates with wild-type rpsL and rrs revealed that (i) there is no cross-resistance to other drugs and (ii) a permeability barrier may contribute to resistance, because resistance was significantly lowered in the presence of a membrane-active agent.
