OBJECTIVE: To investigate if there is a difference in response to tuberculosis treatment between HIV seronegative and HIV seropositive patients following two months of intensive phase tuberculosis treatment. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: St. Francis Leprosy Centre, south-east Uganda. SUBJECTS: Four hundred fifty seven patients with never previously treated sputum smear-positive tuberculosis admitted during a two-year period in 1991/1993. INTERVENTION: Intensive phase treatment with streptomycin, isoniazid, rifampicin and pyrazinamide. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Sputum conversion from a positive to a negative smear at eight weeks of treatment. RESULTS: HIV seropositivity prevalence was 28%. Among HIV seronegative patients, conversion to a negative smear status occurred in 76% persons compared to 78% in HIV seropositive patients. This difference was not statistically significant (OR = 0.9; 95% CI, 0.6-1.5). HIV seropositive patients, however, were more likely to die (p = 0.017). A high prevalence of resistance to isoniazid and streptomycin was found. Isoniazid resistance was more likely in HIV seronegative patients with M. tuberculosis strains compared to HIV seropositive persons (p < 0.005). Initial resistance to antituberculosis drugs did not have a significant effect on smear conversion. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that HIV-seropositive status is not a principal factor in delaying sputum conversion among patients receiving intensive phase tuberculosis treatment.
