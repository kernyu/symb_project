A chromosomal determinant of Streptomyces hygroscopicus, functioning as a positive regulator of the bialaphos-resistance gene bar in the model strain S. lividans, was conjugatively transferred into a bialaphos (BAP) producer through pVGTB24 plasmid. The plasmid is unable to replicate autonomously in S. hygroscopicus, but integrates into its chromosome via homology with the fragment containing this determinant. Integration of pVGTB24 was accompanied by a decrease in resistance of S. hygroscopicus exconjugant clones to the self-produced antibiotic and also by a decrease in their antibiotic productivity.
