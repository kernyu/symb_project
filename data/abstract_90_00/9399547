In vitro activities of cefepime and cefpirome against 96 isolates of Chryseobacterium indologenes and 21 of C. meningosepticum were determined by the agar dilution method. Overall, cefepime was more active than cefpirome against C. indologenes (MIC at which 50% of the isolates were inhibited [MIC50] and MIC90, 4 and 16 microg/ml, respectively, for cefepime and 8 and 128 microg/ml, respectively, for cefpirome). Both agents had poor potency against C. meningosepticum (MIC50 and MIC90, 64 and >256 microg/ml, respectively, for cefepime and 128 and >256 microg/ml, respectively, for cefpirome).
