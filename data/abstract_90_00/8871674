A structure-based design approach was used to develop a cyclized peptide analog of the murine CD4-CDR3-like region as a potential inhibitor of autoimmune CD4+ T cells responsible for the pathogenesis of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE). Our results indicate that this peptide, referred to as rD-mPGPtide, is able to significantly inhibit the clinical and pathologic symptoms of EAE in the SJL mouse model when administered on day 12 of induction. The optimum effective dosage range for the peptide, injected i.v., was between 0.125 and 0.5 mg and dosages of as high as 5 mg had no observable toxic effects. Treated mice had normal levels of lymphocytes less than 2 wk later and exhibited normal in vitro primary responses to alloantigen and secondary responses to keyhole limpet hemocyanin Ag. The specificity of the rD-mPGPtide treatment for autoreactive T cells was demonstrated by inhibiting proteolipid protein (p139-151)-induced EAE and finding that the lymph node T cells from these mice had suppressed responses to this Ag, but normal responses to alloantigen or other nominal Ag. Importantly, rD-mPGPtide was found to be effective on secondary T cell responses in an EAE rechallenge situation and was able to establish conditions for long-term resistance to further Ag exposure. Analysis of the cytokine profile of responding T cells during late effector stages of disease revealed that the levels of IFN-gamma and IL-4 are significantly reduced in rD-mPGPtide-treated mice. These results strongly suggest that the administration of a CD4-CDR3 peptide analog is an effective therapeutic approach for the inhibition of the CD4+ T cell-mediated autoimmune response in EAE.
