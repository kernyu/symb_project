Relationships between amino acid auxotrophy and N-dodecyloxy-carboxy-methyl-N-N-N-trimethyl ammonium chloride (IM) sensitivity have been investigated in isogenic yeast strains Saccharomyces cerevisiae and their meiotic segregants. It has been found, that auxotrophy increases the level of sensitivity to this salt markedly. A gene conferring resistance to that drug cancels the auxotrophy-dependent sensitivity.
