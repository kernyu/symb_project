Although most respiratory tract infections are caused by viruses, bacterial pathogens are responsible for higher morbidity and mortality. Because virtually nothing is known about the etiology of bacterial respiratory pathogens in Saudi Arabia, this study examined the incidence of these organisms in 5426 patients over a 1-year period. Of the bacterial pathogens isolated from 904 patients, the most common organism was Hemophilus influenzae (31%), followed by pneumococci (22%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (16%), and others (31%). Because the first two organisms accounted for more than 50% of isolates, their susceptibility to commonly used antibiotics was also reviewed. The results are presented here.
