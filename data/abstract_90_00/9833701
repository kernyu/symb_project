The susceptibility testing methods used in Denmark were evaluated with respect to their ability to detect cephalosporin resistance with cefuroxime as indicator, especially resistance caused by extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs). Two methods for determination of minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC), three agar diffusion methods, a disc approximation test and the ESBL-Etest were used against a panel of strains producing well-known beta-lactamases. The tablet diffusion test (Rosco Neo Sensitabs) as the most used in Denmark had the lowest detection rate of cefuroxime resistance among ESBL-producing strains. The prediffusion method, which is only used at one laboratory, was the most reliable method for such detection. The MIC methods were in good agreement, but the detection rate for resistance due to ESBLs was low and depended on the antibiotics used. The disc approximation test and the ESBL-Etest both resulted in an acceptable ESBL detection rate. The latter tests discriminated between isolates producing the frequent chromosome-mediated and the in Denmark probably very rare ESBL-mediated cephalosporin resistance. For the evaluation of susceptibility tests such strains require special attention.
