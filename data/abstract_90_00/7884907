The tetracycline repressor (TetR)-regulated gene expression system from Escherichia coli was used to control gene expression in recombinant human cytomegalovirus (HCMV). To adapt the TetR system in HCMV, derivatives of the viral US11 (early) gene promoter, which controls the beta-glucuronidase reporter gene, were constructed by systematic insertion of the tetracycline operator (tetO) sequences. Gene expression from constructs containing two or three appropriately placed tetO sequences adjacent to the TATA box were efficiently repressed by a TetR-VP16 fusion protein (tTA) in a transient expression system. Efficient repression (50- to 120-fold) also occurred in tTA-expressing stably transfected human cells which were infected with recombinant HCMV containing a US11 promoter surrounded by three tetO sequences. The tTA-mediated gene repression was relieved in the presence of 1 microgram of tetracycline per ml. The results of this study are significant in three respects. (i) This is the first demonstration that a TetR-derived protein can be used to efficiently repress gene expression in a mammalian system. (ii) Efficient repression was dependent on the presence of the transcriptional activation domain from the herpes simplex virus type 1 VP16 protein. (iii) The ability to regulate gene expression in a controlled fashion in order to elucidate viral gene function is an important development in the HCMV field. The tTA-mediated gene repression system may be extremely useful for creating host-range mutants in essential genes in order to study their role in the HCMV replicative cycle, a system that is otherwise exceedingly difficult to genetically dissect.
