TAN-1057A-D, dipeptides isolated from bacteria Flexibacter sp. PK-74 and PK-176, are new antibiotics with potent antibacterial activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). We describe, in detail, the synthesis of several TAN-1057A/B analogs by a convergent route featuring a new method to construct the cyclic amidinourea functional group. The biological activity of these substances against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is reported.
