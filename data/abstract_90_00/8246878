Genetic instability in Streptomyces species often involves large deletions sometimes accompanied by DNA amplification. Two such systems in Streptomyces lividans 66 involve the production of mutants sensitive to chloramphenicol and the production of mutants resistant to the galactose analogue 2-deoxygalactose, respectively. Overlapping cosmids were isolated that span the ca. 1 Mb region between the two amplifiable regions. The structure of the region was confirmed by restriction mapping using the rarely cutting enzymes AseI, BfrI and DraI and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. The region contains a non-clonable gap flanked by inverted repeats; the structure is consistent with the presence of a physical gap, i.e. a linear chromosome.
