A large number of Enterobacteriaceae (291 unselected and 30 clinical challenge isolates) were used to evaluate the accuracy of the Vitek GNS-F6 susceptibility testing card for 10 antimicrobial agents (ampicillin, ampicillin/sulbactam, aztreonam, ciprofloxacin, imipenem, mezlocillin, ofloxacin, piperacillin, ticarcillin, and ticarcillin/clavulanate). Results were compared to reference broth microdilution and disk diffusion methods. Highest interpretive error on initial processing were observed with ticarcillin/clavulanate (very major false-susceptible error, 3.4%), imipenem (major false-resistant error, 1.9%), and ampicillin/sulbactam (minor error, 15.9%). Repeat testing resolved many very major errors (21 of 41 results), and the overall accuracy rate was improved from 92.1 to 93.4%. Analysis of all minor interpretive errors demonstrated that the trend for Vitek was to report slightly lower MICs (6 of 10 drugs; 97 of 159 results) in comparison to the reference test results. If a heavy inoculum was used in the Vitek cards, false resistance was observed more frequently with aztreonam and penicillins. These data demonstrate that susceptibility testing accuracy with Vitek GNS-F6 card based on categorical agreement varies from 83.2% (ampicillin/sulbactam) to 99.4% (ciprofloxacin) when testing enteric bacilli. Some antimicrobial agents (beta-lactamase inhibitor/penicillin combinations, antipseudomonal penicillins) may require slight modification of interpretive software. Finally, the overall accuracy of the Vitek System was greater than 91% for 9 of 10 drugs tested with a very low, acceptable rate of false-susceptible error (0.8%).
