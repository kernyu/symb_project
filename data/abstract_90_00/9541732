In a 3-armed, multicentre, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled study involving 91 patients with acne papulopustulosa, Plewig's grade II-III, evidence could be provided of a significant reduction of the propionibacteria as well as a subosuppressive effect (squalene reduction) under a combination of 1% chloramphenicol (CAS 56-75-7) and 0.5% pale sulfonated shale oil versus the alcoholic vehicle (1-2 ml twice daily). Likewise, monotherapy with chloramphenicol resulted in a significant reduction in bacteria compared to the vehicle. The combination therapy was superior to the monotherapy with regard to the sebosuppressive effects. Based on a kinetics test carried out for a total of 2 h, a clinically relevant percutaneous absorption of chloramphenicol was ruled out. The chloramphenicol serum level was between < 5.0 microgram/l to 180 microgram/l (average 25 micogram/l). This is important because with systemic application (peroral, i.v.), the therapeutic chloramphenicol level is > 25 mg/l (25,000 microgram 1). None of the blood count and serum parameters were pathologically changed in a clinically relevant way before and after the therapy. An induction of resistance against chloramphenicol in the propionibacteria could be excluded. No adverse events and side effects occurred. The topical therapy of acne papulopustulosa with chloramphenicol as a monosubstance or in combination with pale sulfonated shale oil represents an effective and safe local antibiotic treatment possibility.
