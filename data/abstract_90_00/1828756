The activity of metronidazole, vancomycin, clindamycin and teicoplanin against Clostridium difficile strains isolated from various origins in Poland was investigated. MIC was determined for metronidazole, clindamycin and teicoplanin. The disc-diffusion method was used for the vancomycin susceptibility test. Three out of thirty-eight strains were resistant to vancomycin and twenty-eight were susceptible to teicoplanin. A widespread MIC was observed for clindamycin and metronidazole. No correlation between the origin of the strain, toxigenicity and susceptibility to teicoplanin, clindamycin, vancomycin and metronidazole was evident.
