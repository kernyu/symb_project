We report the in vitro antibiotic susceptibility of 1,220 strains belonging to the thermotolerant Campylobacter species, isolated from the feces of pediatric patients with diarrhea in the period from 1987 to 1993. The strains were identified as 1,148 C. jejuni isolates and 72 C. coli isolates. The overall results show that the strains showed drug resistance as follows: 51.8% to ampicillin, 4.4% to clindamycin, 2.6% to chloramphenicol, 21.2% to tetracycline, and 1% to gentamicin. Twenty-one strains (1.7%) displayed resistance to the combination of amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, and 3.2% of the strains were resistant to erythromycin (MIC of > or = 4 micrograms/ml), with a notable difference according to the species under consideration. While C. jejuni remained stable at 0.9 to 4% resistance to erythromycin, for C. coli the percentages detected ranged from 0 to 33%, with overall rates of 2.5 and 15.2% for the two species, respectively. Resistance to nalidixic acid (MIC of > or = 32 micrograms/ml) was found in 27.2% of the strains (27.8% for C. jejuni and 18% for C. coli), and resistance to ciprofloxacin (MIC of > or = 4 micrograms/ml) was found in 24.2% of the strains for C. jejuni and 15.2% for C. coli). Cross-resistance between nalidixic acid and ciprofloxacin was found in 89.1% of the strains (type 1 mutants), while 10.9% were resistant to nalidixic acid but susceptible to ciprofloxacin (type 2 mutants).
