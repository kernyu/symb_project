The antibiotic susceptibility of Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae was investigated in five different geographical areas of Sweden in 1990 and compared with results from similar investigations performed in 1983 and 1986. Tests on 100 isolates per species and laboratory were performed by the disk diffusion method, and 10% of the strains plus all resistant ones were sent to the central laboratory for determination of MICs of ampicillin, phenoxymethylpenicillin, cefaclor, loracarbef, erythromycin, tetracycline and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Beta-lactamase production was found in 7% of H. influenzae and 71% of M. catarrhalis, and reduced susceptibility to penicillin in 3% of S. pneumoniae. Low frequencies (1-3%) of tetracycline resistance were found in H. influenzae and in the 2 streptococcal species, in which also less than 1% of the strains were resistant to erythromycin. Resistance to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole occurred in 7% (range 3-14%) of H. influenzae and in 3% of S. pneumoniae. Cefaclor was active against all streptococci except against S. pneumoniae with reduced susceptibility to penicillin. It was active against beta-lactamase negative strains of M. catarrhalis but had, according to the SIR-system, intermediate activity against H. influenzae. Loracarbef was twice as active as cefaclor against H. influenzae but equally active against the 3 other species tested.
