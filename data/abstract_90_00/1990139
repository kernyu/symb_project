Factors that are known to influence plasmid transfer in bacterial populations were studied for the conjugative plasmid pWG613, which determined gentamicin resistance in Staphylococcus aureus. The transfer frequency was largely unaffected over a wide range of temperature (18-42 degrees C); pH also had little effect on the transfer frequency in the range 5.0-8.5. High cell density and log phase cultures were required for optimal plasmid transfer, as were donor:recipient ratios of 0.003-3.3.
