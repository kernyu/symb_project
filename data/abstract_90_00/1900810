We tested the hypothesis that the intensity of specific antichlamydial T cell-mediated immunity in the genital tract of female guinea pigs infected intravaginally with the chlamydial agent of guinea pig inclusion conjunctivitis would determine the resistance or susceptibility to reinfection after a primary chlamydial infection. T cell-enriched lymphocytes were isolated by collagenase treatment of genital tract tissues from either infected or control uninfected female guinea pigs at various times after infection. The nylon wool-enriched T lymphocytes were evaluated for expression of antigen-specific T cell-mediated immunity in vitro by using a blast transformation assay. Both uninfected and infected genital tracts contained T cells, as evidenced by reactivity to concanavalin A, although a greater number of T lymphocytes was detected in the genital tracts of infected animals compared with that in controls. Significant antigen-specific T-cell activity could be detected in the genital tract tissue by 7 days after a primary genital tract infection with the chlamydial agent of guinea pig inclusion conjunctivitis. When antigen-specific activity was assessed at different times after infection, the intensity of the response of genital tract-associated T lymphocytes was directly proportional to the degree of resistance of the animals to genital challenge. Thus, susceptibility of animals to reinfection by chlamydiae appears to be associated with the intensity of the local T cell-mediated immune responses in the genital tract of infected animals.
