We performed basic and clinical studies on the effects of a new oral antimicrobial agent, fleroxacin (FLRX), a new quinolone derivative in male gonococcal urethritis. The antibacterial activity of FLRX against clinical strains of Neisseria gonorrhoeae was roughly comparable to that of norfloxacin and ofloxacin. FLRX was administered to 58 males with gonococcal urethritis. Two different schedules of administration were adopted. One was a single-dose of 300 mg given orally (17 cases) and the other was the oral administration of 200 mg once a day for 3 to 10 days (41 cases). Clinical evaluation was made according to the criteria of the Japanese UTI Committee. The overall efficacy rate was 98% (49/50). For complications of Chlamydia trachomatis (11 cases), the efficacy rate was 90.9% (10/11). No subjective or objective adverse reaction occurred.
