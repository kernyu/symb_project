Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is an important pathogen for the fetus, recipients of solid organ transplants, bone marrow allograft patients, individuals infected with human immunodeficiency virus and other immunosuppressed patients. The clinical features of congenital cytomegalovirus infection as well as HCMV infection and HCMV disease in immunosuppressed transplant recipients are described. Diagnostic methods for HCMV monitoring are discussed from a clinical perspective. Antivirals as Ganciclovir and Foscarnet are used for induction and maintenance regimes for the treatment of HCMV-associated retinitis, pneumonitis, hepatitis, gastrointestinal involvement and neurological disorders. Drug resistance both to Ganciclovir and Foscarnet of HCMV strains isolated from immunosuppressed patients has already been reported. The development of rapid diagnostic tools for the detection of HCMV drug resistance is urgently required.
