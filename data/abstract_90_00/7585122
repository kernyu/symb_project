Despite the prevalence of gamma delta T cells in mucosae that are typically colonized by Candida albicans, little is known of the possible role of these cells in resistance to candidiasis. A sharp increase in the number of gamma delta T cells and macrophages following intraperitoneal inoculation of mice with C. albicans led us to examine the role of these cells in the immune response to C. albicans. We show that the gamma delta T cells enhance macrophage nitric oxide (NO) production and anti-candida activity, in vitro. We also propose that the gamma delta T cells regulate macrophage function during candidiasis in vivo as well, because depletion of these cells abrogated inducible NO synthase expression in mucosae and enhanced murine susceptibility to candidiasis.
