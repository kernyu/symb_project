Recolonized H. pylori strains will be easily resistant to metronidazole and clarithromycin, whereas almost all of H. pylori strains are sensitive to amoxicillin. On the other hand, amoxicillin targets cell wall biosynthesis and clarithromycin inhibits protein synthesis of Helicobacter pylori mainly in the growth phase which induced high intragastric pH condition, however, metronidazole targets DNA and, therefore, is independent of the stationary or growth phase distribution. To established a optimal regimen for Helicobacter pylori treatment, several factors included them should be account according to the parmacokinetical standings.
