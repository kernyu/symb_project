Exposure of the two related human leukemic cell lines U937 and TUR to chemotherapeutic compounds resulted in opposite effects on induction and resistance to apoptosis. Incubation of U937 cells with 1-beta-d-arabinofuranosylcytosine or the etoposide VP-16 was accompanied by growth arrest in G0/G1 of the cell cycle and an accumulation of a population in the sub-G1 phase which exhibited characteristics typical for the apoptotic pathway. In contrast, human TUR leukemia cells demonstrated no significant effects after a similar treatment with Ara-C and VP-16. Thus, TUR cells continued to proliferate in the presence of these anti-cancer drugs and the number of apoptotic cells as evaluated by propidium iodide staining and the detection of internucleosomal DNA fragmentation was significantly reduced when compared to the parental U937 cells. Similar effects were observed upon serum-starvation demonstrating resistance to apoptosis in TUR cells. Whereas induction of apoptosis is regulated by a network of distinct factors including the activation of proteolytically active caspases, we investigated these pathways in both cell lines. U937 cells demonstrated activation of the 32-kDa caspase-3 upon drug treatment by cleavage into the 20-kDa activated form. However, there was no 20-kDa caspase-3 fragment detectable in TUR cells. Simultaneously, the enzymatic activity of caspase-3 was significantly increased in drug-treated U937 cells as measured in vitro by enhanced metabolization of a fluorescence substrate and in vivo by cleavage of an appropriate substrate for caspase-3, namely, protein kinase Cdelta. In contrast, there was little if any caspase-3 activation detectable in drug-treated TUR cells. Taken together, these data suggest a signaling defect in the activation of the caspase-3 proteolytic system in TUR cells upon treatment with chemotherapeutic compounds which is associated with resistance to apoptosis in these human leukemia cells.
