Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin and lomefloxacin were determined for 90 Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains isolated from both AIDS and other patients. Eleven (12.2%) of these strains showed in vitro resistance to one or more first-line antituberculosis drugs. Susceptibility tests were done in 7H12 broth by the radiometric method. The MIC range for ciprofloxacin was 0.125 to 4.0 micrograms/ml; for ofloxacin, 0.25 to 4.0; and for lomefloxacin 0.5 to 4.0 micrograms/ml. On the basis of our data, we believe that the following MIC, when determined in 7H12 broth radiometrically, should be used as break points to classify the strain as susceptible: ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin, 1 microgram/ml or less; lomefloxacin, 2 micrograms/ml or less. Lomefloxacin on a once-daily basis deserves further evaluation as a potential supplementary drug for the treatment of tuberculosis.
