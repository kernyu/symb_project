An important function of the tight junction is to act as a selective barrier to ions and small molecules, although no molecule responsible for the barrier function has been identified. Here we report evidence that the localization of the 7H6 tight junction-associated antigen identified in our laboratory at tight junctions correlates with the barrier function of MDCK cells. MDCK cells in a confluent monolayer possessed a polarized morphology, having an apical plasma membrane and a basolateral membrane, which is separated from the former by tight junctions. MDCK cells expressed both ZO-1 and 7H6 antigen at tight junctions, which maintain a tight barrier as determined by resistance to lanthanum permeation and high transepithelial electrical resistance (TER, 1500 ohm-cm2). The 7H6 antigen disappeared as tight junctions became permeable to lanthanum with a decrease in TER (below 100 ohm-cm2) due to treatment with metabolic inhibitors (10 microns antimycin A and 10 mM 2-deoxyglucose) for 30 min, while leaving ZO-1 at the cell border. The 7H6 antigen appeared at tight junctions again as TER recovered to a high level (1500 ohm-cm2) within 3 h after withdrawal of metabolic inhibitors. In addition, we found that 7H6 antigen is a phosphorylated protein and that phosphorylation is closely related to the localization of 7H6 antigen in the area of tight junctions.
