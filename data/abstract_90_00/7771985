Neonatal infection due to Haemophilus influenzae has several clinical similarities to infection by the more common Streptococcus agalactiae (Strep group B). A high frequency of H. influenzae biotype IV in association with genital, maternal and neonatal infections has been reported in the literature, suggesting this biotype has an affinity for the female genital tract. Cefotaxime should be considered as part of the treatment regimen when this organism is suspected because of the emerging resistance of H. influenzae to ampicillin. We present a case of H. influenzae biotype IV infection in a premature (32 weeks) neonate.
