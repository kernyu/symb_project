In a previous paper we reported the isolation of streptomycin-resistant mutants from Nicotiana plumbaginifolia and presented evidence for chloroplast control of the resistance trait. To understand the molecular basis of the resistance in these mutants, we sequenced three regions in the chloroplast 16s rRNA gene, which correspond to the 5' terminus, the 530 loop, and the 900 stem/loop of Escherichia coli 16s rRNA, and compared them with the sequences of the wild-type. Our results show that: (1) nine mutants have a C to T change at position 912, (2) one mutant (SR1021) has a G to A change at position 885, (3) one mutant has a C to T change at position 526, based on E. coli numbering; and (4) three mutants do not have any change in the regions analyzed. The point mutation detected in SR1021 has not been reported previously. In E. coli 16s rRNA, position 885 is protected from chemical probing by ribosomal protein S12 and is closely juxtaposed with the streptomycin-binding region (positions 912-915) in the predicted secondary structure. It is likely that the G to A transition at this position is a novel mutation for streptomycin resistance.
