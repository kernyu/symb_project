High doses of amoxicillin, equivalent to those produced by 500- and 750-mg oral doses in humans (area under the plasma concentration-time curve), were effective against a penicillin-resistant strain of Streptococcus pneumoniae in an experimental respiratory tract infection in immunocompromised rats; this superior activity confirms the results of previous studies. An unexpected enhancement of amoxicillin's antibacterial activity in vivo against penicillin-resistant and -susceptible S. pneumoniae strains was observed when subtherapeutic doses of amoxicillin were coadministered with the beta-lactamase inhibitor potassium clavulanate. The reason for this enhancement was unclear since these organisms do not produce beta-lactamase. The differential binding of clavulanic acid and amoxicillin to penicillin-binding proteins may have contributed to the observed effects.
