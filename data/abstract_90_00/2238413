Two trials involving a total of 36 Dorset horn lambs were conducted to assess the anthelmintic efficacy of ivermectin against experimental infections of benzimidazole-resistant strains of Haemonchus contortus and Ostertagia circumcincta. Two resistant strains of each of the two species were used and in each trial the lambs were allocated to three groups. One group was given 200 micrograms ivermectin/kg bodyweight orally, the second group was given 5 mg oxfendazole/kg bodyweight orally and the third group remained untreated as controls. Fourteen days after treatment the lambs were necropsied. Ivermectin was found to be more than 99 per cent to 100 per cent effective against all four benzimidazole-resistant strains, whereas oxfendazole was 78.6 per cent and 83.8 per cent effective against the H contortus strains, and 25.6 per cent and 39.8 per cent effective against the O circumcincta strains.
