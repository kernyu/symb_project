77 patients with serious resistant staphylococcal infections, including septicemia, lower respiratory infection, intraabdominal infection, skin and soft tissue infections and urinary tract infection, were treated with demethyl-vancomycin. 82% of the organisms were methicillin-resistant. Most of the patients had severe underlying diseases and were immunocompromised hosts. The infections were serious. The clinical efficacy rate was 73% and the bacteria clearance rate 68%. Mild adverse reactions happened in 11% of the patients and no obvious nephrotoxicity was noted. MIC90 of demethyl-vancomycin against staph. aureus was 2 micrograms/ml. All isolates in this study were highly susceptible to the drug. Demethyl-vancomycin was found more active against staphylococcus than the other 16 antibacterial agents, which are commonly used in this country. The indication and the use of the drug were discussed.
