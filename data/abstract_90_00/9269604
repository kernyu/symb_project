The increased diffusion of Streptococcus agalactiae in the urinary tract and vagina has affected the strain's resistance to antimicrobial agents, so we decided to study the possibility of overcoming its resistance to imidazoles. Our data suggest that overcoming S. agalactiae resistance to imidazoles in contact and growth culture tests depends partly on the electrical conductivity of the culture medium. Although imidazole contact activity and culture activity have different targets in cell structures, we have demonstrated that imidazole resistance in S. agalactiae cells in both types of tests can be affected by the same conditions regulating membrane permeability.
