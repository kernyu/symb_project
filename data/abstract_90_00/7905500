Effects of administered IL-12 on immune responses to viral infection were evaluated. IL-12-mediated effects during lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection in C57BL/6 mice were contrasted to those in either uninfected mice, or mice infected with a virus inducing a more modest T cell response, murine cytomegalovirus. Mice received 0, 1, 10, 100, or 1000 ng/d of IL-12 on the day prior to infection and daily on day 0 to 6 post-infection. Responses were examined on day 7. Low doses of IL-12 enhanced immunity to LCMV infection as demonstrated by increased splenic CD8+ T cell numbers and decreased LCMV replication. Low doses of IL-12 also significantly enhanced splenic CD8+ T cell numbers in murine cytomegalovirus-infected mice. In contrast, high doses of IL-12 were detrimental to resistance against LCMV infection. Higher doses of IL-12: 1) inhibited virus-specific CTL lytic capacity per spleen by > 90%; 2) inhibited virus-induced expansion of CD8+ T cells in spleen, peripheral blood, and lymph nodes by > 80%; 3) induced necrotic lesions in splenic white pulp; and 4) resulted in 2 log increases in splenic and renal viral replication. Initiation of high dose IL-12 treatment on day 0, 1, 2, or 4 post-infection had similar effects. Although serum levels of IFN-gamma and TNF were normally not detectable in LCMV-infected mice, infection acted synergistically with IL-12 for cytokine induction. The IL-12-mediated reduction in CD8+ T cell numbers and synergistic enhancement of circulating cytokines levels observed during LCMV infection were unique to this infection. These results demonstrate that IL-12-mediated effects can be either protective or detrimental, depending upon the environment in which the factor is presented.
