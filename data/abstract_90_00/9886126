With the emergence of multidrug resistant falciparum malaria in Thailand, various approaches have been taken. Research on new antimalarial drugs and the use of existing available drugs with modification are urgently needed. New drugs and drugs in combination such as pyronaridine, WR 238605, arteether, dihydroartemisinin, benflumetol atovaquone/proguanil are being evaluated. Drug combinations for the treatment of patients suffering from uncomplicated falciparum malaria include quinine-tetracycline for 7 days, or sequential treatment of artesunate (600 mg given over 5 days) followed by mefloquine (1,250 mg divided into 2 doses 6 hours apart) are recommended. The sequential treatment is highly recommended for those who failed other treatment regimens. Other combinations such as a short course sequential treatment of artesunate (300 mg given over 2.5 days) followed by a single dose of 750 mg mefloquine, or a combination of mefloquine 1,250 mg together with tetracycline 1 g per day or doxycycline 200 mg per day for 7 days are alternative treatment regimens with acceptable cure rates. The simultaneous administration of artesunate and mefloquine, in various doses and duration of treatment, is currently being investigated. Until proven otherwise, the drug combinations are still recommended for all adult patients suffering from acute uncomplicated falciparum malaria contracted in multidrug resistant areas. In severe malaria and malaria in children, the drug combinations need further investigation.
