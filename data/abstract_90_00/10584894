A total of 457 Staphylococcus aureus strains from the culture collection of the National Reference Center for Staphylococci in Bonn, Germany, were screened for susceptibility to vancomycin because some Staphylococcus aureus strains are able to form subpopulations that show intermediate resistance to vancomycin. Two methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains (isolated in 1993) exhibited intermediate resistance. One of these, Staphylococcus aureus 137-93, which displayed the genomic DNA fragment pattern of the northern German epidemic strain, appeared homogeneously resistant. Neither of these strains had been identified by routine susceptibility testing. The resistance of the German isolates was lower than that of the Japanese isolate Mu50. To determine whether a similar mechanism confers vancomycin resistance in Staphylococcus aureus Mu50 and 137-93, the intracellular cell wall precursor concentration was measured and was not found to be comparably increased in Staphylococcus aureus 137-93. In conclusion, strains showing intermediate resistance have been present in Germany for some time (at least since 1993), but the subpopulations with decreased sensitivity were overlooked during antibiotic susceptibility testing.
