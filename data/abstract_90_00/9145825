The activity of piperacillin/tazobactam, ampicillin/sulbactam, imipenem and nafcillin alone and in combination with vancomycin was compared with vancomycin monotherapy against MRSA in test-tube time-kill studies and in infected fibrin clots. Bactericidal activity was achieved with all regimens except nafcillin monotherapy in test tubes but only with imipenem/vancomycin and nafcillin/vancomycin in fibrin clots infected with heterogeneous strains. No regimen was effective against the homogeneous strain. These agents may have potential as alternatives to vancomycin in selected infections.
