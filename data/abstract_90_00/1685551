The ability of cyclosporin to modify drug accumulation in vitro, measured by the cellular accumulation of daunorubicin, was examined. In 42 patients with chronic lymphatic leukaemia this correlates well with the levels of P-glycoprotein (Pgp) measured by immunofluorescent labelling of Pgp after treatment of the cells with neuraminidase to unmask the epitope recognized by the monoclonal antibody MRK 16. It is shown that flow cytometric analysis using MRK 16 to detect Pgp expression levels together with drug accumulation studies can rapidly assess the multidrug-resistant phenotype of patients' cells, and enable selection of those suitable for therapy with agents known to circumvent mdr-1 mediated drug resistance.
