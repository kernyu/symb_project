A new coagulase-negative and novobiocin-resistant species of the genus Staphylococcus, Staphylococcus fleurettii, isolated from raw-milk cheeses, is described. This species is differentiated from the other novobiocin-resistant staphylococci on the basis of ribotype and intergenic transcribed spacer patterns, DNA-DNA reassociation reactions, cell wall composition and phenotypic characteristics. S. fleurettii could be distinguished by its oxidase activity, by its ability to produce acid aerobically from D-trehalose, D-mannose, D-turanose and maltose and by its inability to produce acid from D-cellobiose. The type strain of S. fleurettii is CIP 106114T (= DSM 13212T).
