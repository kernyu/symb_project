Class A beta-lactamases are the major cause of bacterial resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics. In these active-site serine hydrolases, glutamic acid 166 has been hypothesized to act as a general acid-base catalyst. Replacing this residue by tyrosine in TEM-1 beta-lactamase yields an enzyme the activity of which is substantially lowered and strongly dependent on pH, thus confirming the alleged role of Glu166 in catalysis. This substitution also resulted in a spectacular change in substrate profile, the mutant enzyme being more active on cephalosporins than on penicillins. In fact, the E166Y enzyme behaves much like a class C enzyme, with high affinity and low hydrolytic activity towards second and third generation cephalosporins. Glu166 therefore seems to play a major part in defining the substrate profile of class A beta-lactamases.
