Of the 173 clinical strains of Vibrio cholerae O139 isolated from India, Bangladesh, and Thailand tested, six strains from India were resistant to tetracycline, ampicillin, chloramphenicol, kanamycin, and gentamicin. These six strains harbored a self-transmissible plasmid that mediated resistance to tetracycline, ampicillin, chloramphenicol, kanamycin, gentamicin, sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, and O/129. The multiple drug resistance plasmids were 200 kb in size and belonged to the incompatibility group C. Although a majority of the O139 strains (94.8%) were highly resistant to streptomycin, sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, and O/129, the tetracycline-susceptible strains so far tested were plasmid-negative. The data suggest the existence of two distinct multiple antimicrobial agent resistance (MAR) patterns in V. cholerae O139.
