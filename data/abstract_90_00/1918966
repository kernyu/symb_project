IFN-gamma is an important mediator of cellular resistance against microbial pathogens and tumor cells due in part to its potent capacity to activate macrophages for enhanced cytotoxicity. The present study demonstrates that TNF-alpha regulates the expression of enhanced antimicrobial activity by triggering IFN-gamma primed macrophages to kill or inhibit intracellular Toxoplasma gondii. Resident mouse macrophages stimulated with rIFN-gamma at levels up to 2500 U/ml failed to display enhanced antitoxoplasmal activity when cultured in vitro under low endotoxin conditions (less than 10 pg/ml), but were triggered by addition of small amounts of LPS (0.1 ng/ml). A similar requirement for LPS as a second signal necessary to trigger antitoxoplasmal activity was observed when IFN-gamma was administered to mice in vivo. The essential nature of this triggering step allowed us to explore the role of cytokines that act as endogenous regulators of macrophage activation. rTNF-alpha, although unable to confer antitoxoplasmal activity when used alone to treat macrophages, was capable of triggering IFN-gamma-primed macrophages cultured under low endotoxin conditions. The ability of TNF-alpha to trigger IFN-gamma-primed macrophages was blocked by rabbit anti-TNF-alpha polyclonal antisera but was not affected by polymyxin B indicating that TNF-alpha triggering was not due to contamination with LPS. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that TNF-alpha performs an important regulatory role in the expression of enhanced anti-microbial activity by IFN-gamma-primed macrophages.
