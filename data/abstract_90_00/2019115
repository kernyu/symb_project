Recurrent keratomycosis is reported due to the coelomycete Sphaeropsis subglobosa, which has not been recognised previously as a human pathogen. Infection followed corneal injury by a frayed bamboo cane with implantation of its splinters. Initial successful therapy with 2% clotrimazole topically, to which it was sensitive, was followed by recurrent infection after 39 months, initially a keratitis but progressing to an endophthalmitis. Penetrating keratoplasty was necessary to eradicate the infection. Further isolation of the fungus showed that it had not developed resistance to clotrimazole but had survived dormant, deep in the corneal stroma. S. subglobosa should be considered in bamboo-associated and horticultural injuries.
