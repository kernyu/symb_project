Two new quinolones, NSFQ-104 and NSFQ-105, derivatives of ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin with a 4-(4-aminophenylsulphonyl)-1-piperazinyl at position 7 showed better in-vitro activity against strains of methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus than ciprofloxacin or norfloxacin. Their in-vitro activity was enhanced at pH 5.5.
