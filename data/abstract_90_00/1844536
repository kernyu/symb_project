Field studies in the western Amazon region (state of Acre, Brazil) indicate that the 4-aminoquinolines, as well as the combined regimen with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine, can no longer be recommended for the treatment and prophylaxis of P. falciparum infections in this region. Quinine remains an effective drug when used correctly. However, compliance problems arise due to the often occurring side-effects during a ten day regimen. Prospects of overcoming these constraints by combining a short course of quinine with other drugs are limited, because of the lack of suitable partner compounds. For this reason quinine/clindamycin appears to be a more practical therapy of P. falciparum malaria. In vitro data from this study suggest that mefloquine is another effective alternative for the treatment of falciparum malaria in this Amazon region.
