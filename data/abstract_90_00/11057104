Information about resistant pattern of Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates against antituberculon drugs is a very important part of tuberculosis control and indicates the directions of TB policy in each country. Poland joined WHO/IUATLD global project on drug resistance surveillance, and carried out the first prospective survey, simultaneously on primary and acquired drug resistance of tuberculosis patients according WHO/IUATLD recommendations. The programme covered the whole country, basing on cooperation between the National Reference Laboratory (NRL) with regional TB laboratories. Questionnaires and cultures were obtained from patients who excreted TB bacilli during the period from 1 November 1996 to 1 November 1997 (12 months). Drug susceptibility testing to INH, SM, EMB and RMP were performed on Lowenstein-Jensen medium according to the proportion method or/and radiometric Bactec 460 TB system. 3970 TB patients bacteriologically confirmed by culture were included in a one-year study. The male to female ratio was 2.6:1. Patients were at the age of 6 to 83 years. Majority of patients (86% males and 77% of females) was older than 35 years. Primary resistance to any drug was found in 3.6% of new cases and 2.4% of those patients who excreted monoresistant strains. No monoresistance to EMB was found. 18 patients (0.6%) were infected by MDR strains. Total resistance in new cases was for INH--2.6%, for SM--1.8%, for RMP--0.7% and for EMB--0.1%. Acquired resistance to any drug was found in 17.0% of treated. Majority of patients--7.7% excreted monoresistant strains. 7.0% were infected by MDR strains. Total resistance to INH was 14.8%, to SM--9.2%, to RMP--7.8%, and to EBM--2.5%. No correlation was found between sex and primary resistance rates. Among new cases, 3.7% of males and 3.3% of females were infected with resistant strains. However, among treated patients, males (20%) excreted resistant strains twice as much as females (9.1%). Mean age of women and men infected with primary and acquired resistant strains was similar.
