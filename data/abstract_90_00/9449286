The sequence of the DNA gyrase gyrA gene of Serratia marcescens ATCC 14756 was determined. An open reading frame of 2,640 nucleotides coding for a polypeptide with a calculated molecular mass of 97,460 was found, and its sequence complemented the sequence of an Escherichia coli gyrA temperature-sensitive mutation. Analysis of the PCR products of the quinolone resistance-determining regions of gyrA genes from six quinolone-resistant clinical isolates revealed a single amino acid substitution, Ser-83 to Arg or Asp-87 to Tyr, in all six mutants, suggesting that a mutational alteration in gyrA is a common mechanism of quinolone resistance in S. marcescens.
