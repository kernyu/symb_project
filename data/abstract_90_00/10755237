Helicobacter pylori is an actively dividing helical bacterium that changes to coccoid morphology as the culture ages. It has been suggested that the coccoid forms may be involved in transmission of infection and in relapses following antimicrobial therapy. The aim of this investigation was to determine the survival and susceptibility of the coccoid forms to amoxycillin, erythromycin, gentamicin and metronidazole. Colony counts and microscopic examination were performed after 1-4 weeks of culture. At 2 and 4 weeks, identical cultures were treated with the antibiotics for 24 h. Our results showed that 4-week cultures of coccoid forms were cultivable after antibiotic treatment.
