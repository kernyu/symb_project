Enterococci are part of the normal human and animal bowel flora. They are considered bacteria of relatively low virulence, but are important nosocomial pathogens. In the context of their intrinsic resistance to a number of antimicrobial agents, the rapid emergence of multiresistant enterococci is alarming. As inhabitants of the gastrointestinal tract, they come into close contact with other bacteria and may pass antibiotic resistance genes to them. We report the first case of infection with a VanA vancomycin-resistant. Enterococcus in Norway. The strain was identified as Enterococcus faccium with high level resistance to aminoglycosides, ampicillin, teicoplanin and vancomycin. The VanA phenotype was confirmed by PCR detection of the vanA gene. Transmission, treatment, prevention, and control of infections with vancomycin-resistant enterococci is discussed.
