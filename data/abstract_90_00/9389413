A point mutation assay was developed to detect the quantitative prevalence of mutations at codons 460 (M to I; M to V), 520 (H to Q), 594 (A to V) and 595 (L to F; L to S) within the UL97 gene of human cytomegalovirus which segregate with ganciclovir resistance. Synthetic mixtures of wild-type and mutant plasmids containing the UL97 gene were amplified by nested polymerase chain reaction and the 700 base pair amplicon subsequently subjected to the point mutation assay. In plasmid reconstruction experiments, there was a high correlation between experimentally derived percentage mutant with the theoretical values. The assay was then used to assess the changes in the genetic composition of the UL97 gene in three patients on prolonged ganciclovir therapy. All three patients developed genotypic resistance against ganciclovir involving mutation at codon L595S, L595F and double mutation at codons L595F and M460I. In one patient, alteration of therapy to foscarnet did not affect the composition of UL97 and virus remained genotypically resistant to ganciclovir. In contrast, in two patients whose therapy was altered to cidofovir (HPMPC), repopulation with cytomegalovirus strains carrying the wild-type (ganciclovir-sensitive) codon at positions 595 and 460 occurred. The potential use of this assay for the rapid detection of cytomegalovirus resistance in patients on long-term ganciclovir therapy is discussed.
