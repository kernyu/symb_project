The in vitro activity of the fluoroquinolone CP-99,219 against gram-positive bacteria was compared with those of five other antimicrobial agents. Against ciprofloxacin-susceptible staphylococci and against streptococci, MICs were < or = 0.12 and < or = 0.5 microgram/ml, respectively. CP-99,219 was also more active than ciprofloxacin against ciprofloxacin-resistant staphylococci, most enterococci, Leuconostoc spp., and lactobacilli.
