Fifty one strains of Salmonella typhi were isolated during the recent outbreak of enteric fever in and around Calcutta. Forty strains were multidrug resistant including Chloramphenicol. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of Chloramphenicol was between 200 mcg per ml and 500 mcg per ml. All these strains were sensitive to Cephalexine, Gentamicin, Furazolidine and Ciproflexacin. Widal test was done in all the cases but the result was inconclusive.
