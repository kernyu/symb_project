The prevalence of Enterobacteriaceae from midstream urine samples from patients with community acquired urinary tract infections (UTI) of a town in SW Greece during one year period and their susceptibility to antibiotics were studied. The most frequently recovered pathogens were E. coli (77%), Proteus mirabilis (10%), Klebsiella spp (8.7%), Enterobacter spp (2.5%) and Citrobacter freundii (1.8%). E. coli were found more resistant to carbenicillin, the combination of amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and cotrimoxazole. Half of the strains were found resistant to more than one antibiotics. All strains were found sensitive to aminoglucosides, 2nd generation cephalosporines (except cefoxitin), 3rd generation cephalosporines, aztreonam and imipeneme. According to our results a statistically significant increase of the resistance to antibiotics at individuals over 45 years of age was noticed. The positivity of the samples was not correlated to prior antibiotic consumption and to the occupation of the participants or their residence.
