Nucleotide sequence of Acholeplasma laidlawii genome site PG-8B (1000 n.p.), containing topoisomerase IV subunit genes (parE and parC), has been determined. Sequenced genome site contains a gene fragment coding for the C-terminal region of ParE and gene fragment coding for N-terminal region of ParC. Topoisomerase IV subunite genes in A. laidlawii genome are situated near each other and overlapping by 4 nucleotides. Selection in liquid nutrient medium with ascending antibiotic concentrations resulted in derivation of A. laidlawii PG-8B cells resistant to ciprofloxacin, a fluoroquinolone. The resistant clones contain a mutation in the parC QRDR region determining fluoroquinolone resistance: Ser(91) (corresponding to Ser(80) in Escherichia coli ParC) replacement) for Leu.
