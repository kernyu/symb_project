Enterococci are important causative organisms of nosocomial infections as well as methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Enterococcal bacteremia has been increased in Nagoya University Hospital from April 1983 to March 1990. We analyzed the clinical backgrounds, portal of entry and mortality for the patients with Enterococcal septicemia. Thirty-four cases with enterococcal septicemia (24 Enterococcus faecalis, 10 Enterococcus faecium) were subjected in this study. Twenty-seven cases were monomicrobial septicemia and 7 cases were polymicrobial septicemia. As to the portal of entry, intra-abdominal infections in 21 cases, urinary tract infections in 4 cases, respiratory tract infections or chest tubes in 2 cases, decbitus infection in 1 case, intravascular catheter in 1 case, and unknown sources in 5 cases. Total mortality of the septicemia was 44.1%. E. faecium and Enterococcus avium were much more resistant to antimicrobial agents than E. faecalis. Enterococci with high-level resistance to gentamicin (minimal inhibitory concentration, greater than 2000 micrograms/ml) accounted for 35% of the 26 clinical isolates of enterococci.
