221 yeast strains including 131 of Candida albicans, 21 of C. tropicals, 23 of C. parapsilosis, 19 of C. glabrata, 7 of C. guilliermondii, 6 of C. krusei and of other species were isolated from the blood. The activity of fluconazole and amphotericin B was investigated by means of a photometer-read broth microdilution method measuring the 30% inhibitory concentrations (IC30). The results of fluconazole showed a higher susceptibility of C. albicans compared to the other species. However, 6 (4.5%) resistant strains of C. albicans were found. Low sensitivity and resistance were evaluated for C. krusei and C. glabrata strains. All isolates showed susceptibility to amphotericin B.
