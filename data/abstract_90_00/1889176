The susceptibility of 42 strains of Xanthomonas (Pseudomonas) maltophilia to 37 antibiotics (mainly beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, and fluorinated quinolones) was tested. Xanthomonas maltophilia was resistant to most beta-lactams, with ceftazidime, moxalactam, and ICI-194008 being the most active ones. Aminoglycosides had a very modest activity, with quinolones showing only moderate activity against this species. Trimethoprim/sufamethoxazole was effective against all strains tested. We also tested the synergy of several beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitors against X. maltophilia. Only aztreonam/clavulanic acid at 3:1, 1:1 and, mainly, 2:1 combinations had synergistic activity, decreasing the rate of resistance from 92.8% for aztreonam alone to 32.4% for aztreonam-clavulanic acid at 1:1 and 0% for aztreonam-clavulanic acid at 2:1.
