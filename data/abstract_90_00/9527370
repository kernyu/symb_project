BACKGROUND: The aim of this paper is to review the epidemiological, clinical and therapeutical characteristics of Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) epiglottitis in children at a time when an efficient and safe vaccination is available. METHODS: The clinical histories of 21 children admitted to Children's Hospital La Fe (1971-1996) with a clinical diagnosis of epiglottitis and isolation of the microorganism in blood cultures (20 cases) and surface culture of the epiglotis (one case) are reviewed. RESULTS: The annual average was 4/100,000 children under 5 years of age. Evolution prior to diagnosis was > 12 hours in 52.4% of the cases. More males were affected (52.4% vs 47.6%). All the children except one (95.2%) were under 5 years of age; 81% were under 3 years of age and 1 child was 6 years and 8 months old. Respiratory distress (100%) and fever > or = 38 degrees C (85.7%) were the most common clinical manifestations. General health was affected in 71.4% of the cases and 66.7% had leucocytosis on admission. The clinical diagnosis was confirmed by direct visualization of the epiglotis in 76.1% of the cases. Hib was isolated in blood culture in 20 cases (95.2%). The strains produced beta-lactamases and were ampicillin-resistant in 57.1%. 19 children (90.5%) required endotracheal intubation. Initial empiric antibiotic therapy was third generation cephalosporins (cefotaxime or ceftriaxone) alone or combined with ampicillin. One child died (4.8%). CONCLUSIONS: Pediatricians must still be aware of this serious infection in order to diagnosis and treat it as early as possible.
