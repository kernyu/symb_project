A P157S mutation in the reverse transcriptase (RT) of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 conferred fivefold resistance to (-)-beta-2',3'-dideoxy-3'-thiacytidine in cell culture. Interestingly, the P157S mutation resulted in increased sensitivity (two- to threefold) to 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (AZT) and to (R)-9-(2-phosphonylmethoxypropyl)adenine (PMPA). A similar increase in susceptibility to AZT and to PMPA was also conferred by the M184V mutation in RT.
