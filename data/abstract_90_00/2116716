A study was made of the effects of high temperatures and glutaraldehyde on the spores and vegetative cells of Str. thermovulgaris strain 127. It was determined at what treatment times for different temperatures and glutaraldehyde concentrations the spore germination and vegetative cell growth stopped. A high heat stability was found for glucose isomerase, the loss in enzymatic activity increasing with the increase in glutaraldehyde concentration and exposure time. It was determined at what optimum parameters of the combined treatment the growth of the strain stopped and a comparatively high level of glucose isomerase activity was preserved.
