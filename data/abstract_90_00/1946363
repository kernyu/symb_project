A method for transforming Tetrahymena has been established earlier, but its application has been limited because of the lack of selectable markers other than the rRNA-encoding DNA (rDNA). Mutations in the yeast ribosomal protein L29 gene (CYH2) are known that confer cycloheximide resistance. We have cloned and sequenced the homologue of this gene from both a wild-type and a cycloheximide-resistant (ChxA) strain of Tetrahymena. Surprisingly, a comparison shows that the ChxA mutation is not present in the CYH2 homologue. We therefore created the yeast mutations in the Tetrahymena gene by site-directed mutagenesis and used them to transform Tetrahymena either with or without linking to an rDNA vector. All clones transformed by the rDNA vector also became resistant to cycloheximide when the rDNA contained the engineered mutant genes. Without the rDNA vector, the mutant genes transform approximately 1% of injected cells to become resistant to cycloheximide. DNA analysis indicates that transformation occurs by replacement of the host sequence and not by random integration of the injected sequence. The replacement occurs to some but not all copies of this gene in the polyploid macronuclear genome. Thus, transformation in Tetrahymena occurs by specific sequence replacement, and the injected mutant genes can serve as dominant selectable transformation markers in this organism.
