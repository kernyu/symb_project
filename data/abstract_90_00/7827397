Calcium channel blockers are used in the treatment of hypertension because of their ability to decrease peripheral vascular resistance. Recent research has suggested that these drugs also preserve or improve renal function in patients with essential hypertensive renal disease or diabetic renal disease, and in renal transplant recipients with or without cyclosporin therapy. In general, studies in animal models of hypertension and in hypertensive humans have demonstrated reduction in renal vascular resistance, and preservation or enhancement of renal plasma flow and glomerular filtration rate. In addition, calcium channel blockers appear to have a positive effect on renal addition, calcium channel blockers appear to have a positive effect on renal haemodynamic function in the setting of diabetes mellitus; prospective trials have also demonstrated reductions in urinary protein excretion in these patients. Current evidence suggests that calcium channel blockers are well-suited for the treatment of patients with hypertensive disease even in the presence of renal impairment, a clinical scenario common in the elderly population.
