In order to analyse whether drug sensitivity testing would be beneficial for clinical decision-making in heavily pretreated patients, we retrospectively studied viral genotype and phenotypic drug resistance in 12 HIV-1-infected patients, each of them with a history of failing at least one therapeutic regimen including one or two protease inhibitors (PIs). The salvage therapy included nelfinavir as new PI in all cases. Four patients showed a sustained and five patients a transient viral load decrease. Three patients failed to show a significant decline of plasma HIV-1 RNA. In the baseline samples of these cases, resistance against all components of their combination therapy could be detected, whereas at least one antiretroviral drug was still active in the cases with transient treatment response. All patients with sustained therapy response harboured viruses that were either fully sensitive or resistant to only one of the drugs administered. In our study, phenotypic drug resistance was predictive for the success of antiretroviral salvage regimens.
