The nucleotide sequence of the ileS gene conferring high-level resistance to mupirocin in Staphylococcus aureus J2870 has been determined. The gene sequence is substantially different from that of the native ileS gene of S. aureus, indicating that high-level resistance to mupirocin results from the acquisition of a novel ileS gene.
