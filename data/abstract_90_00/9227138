Some cases of oral candidosis are refractory to antifungal treatment. This might be related to development of resistant Candida strains, but susceptibility testing is not standardized and not routinely available, and information related to this problem is scarce in non-AIDS patients. In this study, the in vitro antifungal resistance of oral Candida albicans strains was evaluated. The strains were obtained from a cohort of 72 HIV-negative patients with oral yeast carriage and clinical complaint. Laboratory identification revealed C. albicans in 93% of cases. None of these oral C. albicans isolates showed in vitro resistance to polyenes, but they showed varying resistance levels to fluorocytosine and azoles. This study confirms the usefulness of standardizing susceptibility testing so that it could be routinely available and of realizing a mycological diagnosis including an antifungigram when oral candidosis is suspected, whenever antifungal treatment with azoles is planned.
