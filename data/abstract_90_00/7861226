The authors found that multidrug-resistant human glioblastoma GB-1 cells demonstrated significantly more resistance to cisplatin than did nondrug-resistant human glioblastoma U87-MG cells (p < 0.1). They therefore attempted to determine whether calcium channel blockers enhance the antitumor activity of cisplatin against GB-1 cells. Nifedipine, a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker, significantly enhanced the antitumor effect of cisplatin on GB-1 cells (p < 0.05). In the absence of normal extracellular Ca++, nifedipine enhanced the cytotoxicity of cisplatin. In addition, the antitumor activity of combined cisplatin and nifedipine was inhibited both by actinomycin D and cycloheximide, suggesting that such activity is dependent upon new RNA and protein synthesis. Surprisingly, DNA fragmentation assay demonstrated that synergism between cisplatin and nifedipine resulted in apoptosis (programmed cell death) at a relatively low concentration of cisplatin, which when tested alone did not induce apoptosis. In addition, it was demonstrated that nuclei from GB-1 cells lacked a Ca(++)-dependent endonuclease that degrades chromatin into nucleosomes and that calcium ionophore A 23187 did not decrease the viability of GB-1 cells. The above findings suggest the hypothesis that the noncytotoxic agent nifedipine synergistically enhances the antitumor effect of cisplatin on multidrug-resistant GB-1 cells lacking Ca(++)-dependent endonuclease, and subsequently induces apoptosis via its interaction with an as yet uncharacterized functional site other than the calcium channel on GB-1 cells.
