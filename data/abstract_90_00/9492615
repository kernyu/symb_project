Tuberculosis is a continuous threat for health in all parts of the world. In industrialized centers an emerging increase of tuberculosis is observed due to low health standards, poor health education and control, increasing migration and the HIV epidemic. This should alert the pediatrician, since most tuberculosis infections in childhood start with contacts of infected adults with children. There is still a good response to most drugs against tuberculosis, but in some parts of the world the resistance to conventional treatment is an emerging problem. In general incidence, morbidity and mortality of tbc in children of the western world is low and has good prognosis. However, the diagnostic principles and the education of pediatricians for recognizing tbc is still of utmost importance.
