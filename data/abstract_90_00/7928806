Rifampicin was inactivated by Nocardia otitidiscaviarum to yield two products designated RIP-3 and RIP-4. The full structures of RIP-3 and RIP-4 were determined to be 21-(O-phosphoryl) rifampicin and 3-formyl-21-(O-phosphoryl) rifamycin SV, respectively, but neither product had any antimicrobial activity.
