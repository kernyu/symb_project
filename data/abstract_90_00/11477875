OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of tetrandrine (Tet) on the collagen contents of lung tissues in rats with chronic hypoxic pulmonary hypertension. METHOD: Using colorimetric method after oxidized by chloramine T to determine hydroxyproline contents of lung tissues and extrapulmonary arteries, using Masson method, image pattern analysis technique and gray scale scanning to observe the changes of collagen distribution in extrapulmonary arteries and lung tissues in rats with hypoxia and the effect of treatment with Tet. RESULT: Tet could remarkably reduce the mean pulmonary arterial pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance in rats with hypoxic pulmonary hypertension and could inhibit the increase of collagen contents in lung tissues and extrapulmonary arterial wall. CONCLUSION: Tet may be used as one of the main drugs in the treatment of chronic hypoxic pulmonary hypertension due to its action of reducing mPAP and collagen contents.
