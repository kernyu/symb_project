The antiviral activity described by Riedel and Brown (J. Virol. 29, 51-60) has been purified to homogeneity. A study of the effects of this pure peptide on mosquito cell growth and virus replication has been undertaken. We have found that treatment of noninfected Aedes albopictus cells with this antiviral peptide results in a temporary arrest of cell division accompanied by acquisition of virus resistance and the constitutive production of the antiviral protein.
