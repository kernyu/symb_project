Because they receive many infected patients with various degrees of immunosuppression, the haematology departments have a high consumption of antibiotics. The possible relationship between antibiotic consumption and bacterial resistance is discussed in many specialities, especially for some classes like quinolones. This possible relationship has to be evocated in haematology where patients are at high risk of severe sepsis because of neutropenia. In Henri Mondor hospital, we studied the evolution of bacterial susceptibility and of antibiotic consumption in the haematology unit on a 6 year period. We found that this susceptibility was finally stable over time. The main factors which may influence the evolution of the bacterial susceptibility in our study, and in the literature are discussed.
