The sensitivity of 245 strains of Staph. aureus and 171 strains of Ps. aeruginosa to antibiotics was tested in patients with burn septicemia. The results indicated that both the bacteria were resistant to the widely used antibiotics. The causes for producing the resistance to drugs were analyzed. We consider that "circular therapy" of antibiotics, alternatively stopping and reusing some antibiotics according to the variation in the bacterial resistance to drugs, should be a valuable method for preventing the resistance to drugs.
