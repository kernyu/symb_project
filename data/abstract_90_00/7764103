The growth kinetics of adherent baby hamster kidney cells cultivated with additional cholesterol as well as the effect of cholesterol addition on shear stress sensitivity were investigated. The influence of various cholesterol preparations was tested, whereby dimethylsulfoxide and ethanol show negative effects at higher concentrations. With addition of cholesterol in the range of 90 micrograms ml-1, a positive effect on the shear stress resistance was achieved.
