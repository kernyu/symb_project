BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to know the demographic profile of the new cases of tuberculosis (TB) and evaluate the current status of resistance to antituberculous drugs in Madrid, Spain. METHODS: A transversal study was carried out in 8 hospitals (6 general hospitals) during 6 months. The clinical data of patients over 14 years old who presented a positive culture for Mycobacterium tuberculosis were collected in a protocolized method; the study on sensitivity to 5 drugs was independently and centrally performed (proportions method). RESULTS: 467 patients (339 from general hospitals), were included. In respect to the latter patients, 71% were under the age of 45 years and 36% presented coinfection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). A sensitivity study was performed in 419 strains. Forty strains showed resistance to one or more of the antituberculous drugs; 13 were from the same center (CIC) in which a nosocomial outbreak of multiresistent TB had been detected among HIV infected patients. Resistence to more than one drug was observed in 29 cases (6.9%) and to rifampicine (RIF) and isoniacide (INH) in 24 patients (5.7%). On excluding the patients from the CIC these values were 16 (4.1%) and 13 (3.3%), respectively. Ninety-two percent of the strains with resistence to RIF + INH were from HIV positive patients. The rate of primary resistence to iNH in the patients with TB without HIV infection was 2.7%. This rate was 9.3% in those with HIV infection, and was 5.7% on excluding CIC cases. In patients with HIV infection most of the strains with primary resistence to INH also presented primary resistance to RIF. CONCLUSIONS: More than one third of the patients with TB diagnosed in the general hospitals in Madrid, presented coinfection with HIV. In this population, the initial treatment for TB should probably begin with 4 drugs while awaiting the obliged sensitivity study.
