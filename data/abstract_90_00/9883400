Despite advances in antimicrobial chemotherapy over recent decades, morbidity and mortality secondary to infection continues to rise. In addition, the incidence of infection caused by resistant organisms has also increased. Concurrently, the elderly are living longer than prior generations, often with disabling chronic diseases. The more debilitated of the geriatric population are at greater risk for infection, and more likely to acquire or develop antimicrobial resistant organisms. Gram-positive organisms are a source of resistance and commonly cause infection in older patients. Whereas resistance is a concern in all patients, in the elderly this is magnified by limitations in treatment options because of differences in pharmacokinetics and tolerance as compared with younger counterparts. Pharmacokinetic differences include changes in drug distribution and may arise as a result of diminished end organ function. Age-related decreases in renal function often impact on commonly prescribed antimicrobials. In addition, the elderly are more susceptible to drug-drug interactions because polypharmacy is common in this patient population. Streptogramins may offer a useful alternative in the treatment of infections in the elderly due to their coverage of organisms commonly causing infections in this population and because of their favourable pharmacokinetic profiles. While published experience is limited, streptogramins are not appreciably eliminated by the kidney and, therefore, they are less subject to age-related changes in renal elimination. What is required is multi-dose pharmacokinetic analysis of streptogramins in geriatric populations and subset analysis of patient use data on file. The following will provide the reader with the most recently presented data on streptogramin use and their potential. While focusing on potential use in the elderly, we have cited data and issues which we believe will be relevant in the geriatric population.
