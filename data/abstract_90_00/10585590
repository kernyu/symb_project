We have shown that the loss of p53 function contributed to resistance of tumor cells to TNF-induced cytotoxicity. In the present study, we evaluated the effect of wild-type p53 (wt-p53) expression on TNF sensitivity, by introducing wt-p53 into MCF7/Adr cells in which p53 was deleted, via a recombinant adenovirus encoding p53 (Ad-p53). Our results indicate that infection with Ad-p53 (50-100 viral particles per cell) resulted in pronounced cytotoxicity, whereas infection with 10 viral particles per cell, which was weakly toxic for the MCF7/Adr cells, sensitized these cells to TNF-induced cell death. Moreover, expression of wt-p53 in MCF7/Adr cells induced the production of reactive oxygen intermediates (ROIs) and caused glutathione (GSH) depletion, indicating disturbances in the cellular redox state. Additional treatment of cells with the anti-oxidant and glutathione (GSH) precursor N-acetylcysteine (NAC) resulted in inhibition of p53-induced ROIs production and in partial restoration of intracellular GSH levels, which was associated with the ability of NAC to inhibit p53-modulated TNF-induced cytotoxicity. Interestingly, Ad-p53 was able to inhibit TNF-induced MnSOD mRNA expression in MCF7/Adr cells, which might contribute to the sensitization of cells to the cytotoxic action of TNF. Taken together, our data strongly suggest that wt-p53 expression sensitizes TNF-resistant MCF7 cells with p53 deletion to TNF-induced cell death by a pathway that is dependent on ROIs production.
