The type I IFNs represent a primordial, tightly regulated defense system against acute viral infection. IFN-alpha confers resistance to viral infection by activating a conserved signal transduction pathway that up-regulates direct antiviral effectors and induces immunomodulatory activities. Given the critical role of IFN-alpha in anti-human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) immunity and the profound ability of HCMV to escape the host immune response, we hypothesized that HCMV blocks IFN-alpha-stimulated responses by disrupting multiple levels of the IFN-alpha signal transduction pathway. We demonstrate that HCMV inhibits IFN-alpha-stimulated MHC class I, IFN regulatory factor-1, MxA and 2',5-oligoadenylate synthetase gene expression, transcription factor activation, and signaling in infected fibroblasts and endothelial cells by decreasing the expression of Janus kinase 1 and p48, two essential components of the IFN-alpha signal transduction pathway. This investigation is the first to report inhibition of type I IFN signaling by a herpesvirus. We propose that this novel immune escape mechanism is a major means by which HCMV is capable of escaping host immunity and establishing persistence.
