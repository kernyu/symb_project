In order to evaluate antimicrobial activity of cefmenoxime (CMX), minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of CMX and control drugs were determined against clinical isolates from patients of sinusitis that were obtained in our laboratory from October of 1993 to March of 1994. The results are summarized as follows; 1. CMX showed strong antimicrobial activities against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis that were 3 major aerobic bacteria from sinusitis. Antimicrobial activities of CMX against benzylpenicillin (PCG)-insensitive S. pneumoniae (PISP) and PCG-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP) were stronger than those of ampicillin (ABPC), and these strong activities suggested that CMX might have strong antimicrobial activities against beta-lactamase producing H. influenzae and M. (B.) catarrhalis. 2. Antimicrobial activities of CMX against microaerophiles, Streptococcus constellatus, Streptococcus intermedius and Gemella morbillorum and against Peptostreptococcus spp., from chronic sinusitis and odontogenic maxillary sinusitis, were stronger than those of most of the control drugs. 3. The MIC90's of CMX against isolates from patients of sinusitis were < or = 0.025-0.39 micrograms/ml. These values were lower than transitional concentrations in mucous membrane of maxillary sinus obtained when "1% CMX nasal solution" was used with nebulizer. It appears likely that sufficient concentrations exceeding MICs against main organisms would be obtained by nebulizer treatment using CMX nasal solution.
