Biochemical changes that accompany acquisition of miconazole resistance in a single step mutant of C. albicans 3153 were analyzed. Experiments show that resistance to this drug was associated with decrease in total lipids, phospholipids and sterol content. Fluorescence polarization studies with 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene (DPH) showed decrease in polarization value (p) in resistant cells, thus indicating changes in membrane fluidity. Uptake of [3H] proline by intact cells revealed decrease in K(m) and Vmax of high affinity system (S1) of proline transport in cells resistant to miconazole. Results of this study suggest that membrane sensitivity of miconazole is determined by overall membrane organisation rather than by affinity of antifungal drug(s) for a single membrane component.
