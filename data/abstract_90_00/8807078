Macrolide resistance in Mycobacterium avium can be detected with an adaption of a commercially available RNA/RNA duplex mismatch assay (Ambion, Austin, Tex.). The sensitivity and specificity values for the assay were 100% when evaluated against 41 macrolide-resistant and -susceptible strains of M. avium. Resistant subpopulations of approximately 20% could be readily detected. The assay is simple to perform and interpret, inexpensive, and rapid (< 24-h turnaround).
