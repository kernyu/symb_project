An attempt was made to induce insertions in marine bacterium Alteromonas espejiana Bal-31 (Ae) using the TnphoA transposon. The Ae mutants selected on a kanamycin-containing medium after conjugation of the Ae with the transposon donor, Escherichia coli SM10(pRt291), were resistant not only to kanamycin (Kn), but also to bleomycin (Bm), and were sensitive to tetracycline. Although the mutants were phenotypically similar to insertion mutants, the mutations appeared to be spontaneous. The sensitivity of spontaneous Kmr Ae mutants selected at various Km concentrations to Bm was investigated. The mutants selected at low Km concentrations were resistant to Bm, whereas those selected at high Km concentrations were sensitive to Bm. The possible mechanisms underlying the dual resistance to Bm and aminoglycosides in bacteria are discussed.
