Antimicrobial resistance is a global concern. Over the past 10 years, considerable efforts and resources have been expended to detect, monitor, and understand at the basic level the many different facets of emerging and increasing resistance. This review summarizes our current understanding of bacterial antimicrobial resistance issues in Canada with particular emphasis given to the Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus, Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Streptococcus pyogenes. In addition, future concerns and programs for ongoing surveillance are discussed.
