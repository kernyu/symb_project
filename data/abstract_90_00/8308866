We have previously reported that linking quinolones to the cephalosporin 3'-position through an ester bond, a carbamate function, or a bond through a quaternary nitrogen produced cephalosporins with a dual mode of antibacterial action. We now describe a new class of dual-action cephalosporins, with greater chemical stability than those previously reported, in which the basic nitrogen of ciprofloxacin is bonded directly to the 3'-cephalosporin position, i.e., the two moieties are linked through a tertiary amine function. These compounds have demonstrated potent activity against a broad spectrum of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, including beta-lactam-resistant strains.
