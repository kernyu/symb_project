Multiple Antibiotic Resistance (MAR) index of faecal indicator bacterium Escherichia coli, isolated from water and sediment in the Bhavani river was employed to assess the quality of the river, and the risk of contamination. The MAR index of all the stations exceeded the high risk level (0.250) of contamination. The study of MAR index for individual isolates also showed high resistance against the tested antibiotics and it was found that these antibiotic resistant E. coli were distributed throughout the length of river sampled. It is concluded that the river is contaminated with faecal enteric bacteria, originating from high risk sources such as night soil, commercial poultry farms etc. It is implied that the quality of river water is not safe for drinking purpose and that adequate measures may be taken before use.
