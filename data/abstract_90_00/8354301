In a ten-year survey (1983-1992) of quinolone resistance in Escherichia coli causing urinary tract infections in a general practice patient population, 9,934 strains were tested. Resistance increased remarkably from 1989 onwards. The rate of resistance to pipemidic acid was < or = 6% before 1989 and 18% in 1992; the rate of resistance to ciprofloxacin (MIC > or = 4 mg/l) was 0.8% in 1989 and 7.1% in 1992. Although the consumption of older quinolones decreased the total consumption of quinolones increased yearly.
