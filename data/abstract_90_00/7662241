Office blood pressure (OBP), ambulatory blood pressure (ABP), and vascular reactivity were measured in 12 normotensive 'social' drinkers (mean alcohol consumption of 9.7 +/- 3.1 g/day) after 4 days of alcohol consumption (1 g/kg/day) and compared with the effects of an isocaloric substitute (sucrose, 1.75 g/kg/day) or no intervention. Alcohol consumption did not affect OBP or 24-mean ABP but appeared to decrease nocturnal systolic and diastolic blood pressure soon after consumption. Although vascular reactivity did not differ between the groups, the blood pressure rise in response to isometric exercise tended to be lower following alcohol. Thus, short-term alcohol ingestion by normotensive 'social' drinkers does not increase office or ambulatory blood pressure.
