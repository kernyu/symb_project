By inducing with mitomycin C the following phages were isolated from all the tested 32 methicillin resistant strains of S. aureus: the serogroup B phage was isolated from 2 strains, the serogroup B and F phages were isolated from 5 strains and the serogroup F phage was isolated from 25 strains. The phages were divided into 5 groups by the antiphage immunity. In group 1 of the phages 4 additional phages were specified. By the specificity of the prophages in the cultures all the strains were divided into 5 groups. Group 1 of the cultures was divided into 5 subgroups (A, B, C, D and E).
