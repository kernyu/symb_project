Peroxidation of unsaturated fatty acids in membrane phospholipids is one of the multiple cytotoxic effects of oxidative stress. Lipid peroxidation is significant because a single initiating event triggers a chain reaction, thus amplifying the initial stimulus. Many oxidative stress-related pathologies have been linked to lipid peroxidation. Mouse glutathione S-transferase mGSTA4-4 exhibits high glutathione conjugating activity with toxic products of lipid peroxidation, e.g., 4-hydroxynon-2-enal. In addition, mGSTA4-4 has glutathione peroxidase activity toward phospholipid hydroperoxides. On the basis of these catalytic properties, we have previously proposed that the enzyme may be physiologically important in alleviating the cytotoxic effects of lipid peroxidation. We have now experimentally confirmed this hypothesis by transfecting HepG2 cells with mGSTA4 cDNA, and demonstrating a protective effect of expressed mGSTA4-4 protein on cells exposed during plating to H2O2, organic hydroperoxides, and phosphatidylcholine hydroperoxide. As compared to cells transfected with insert-free vector, a larger proportion of mGSTA4-transfected cells was able to attach to the culture dish, and continued to divide in the presence of the above compounds. In addition to alleviating the cytotoxic effects of oxidative stress, mGSTA4-4 may interfere with the subtoxic but cytostatic signals generated by a low-level pro-oxidant state.
