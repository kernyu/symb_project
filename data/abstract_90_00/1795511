The effect on metallic corrosion of antibiotics containing the fused-ring structure of tetracycline (doxycycline and the dihydrate and hydrochloride salts of oxytetracycline) when present in 1% KCl solution was investigated. Corrosion potential and zero resistance ammetry studies were carried out; the effects observed were variable and depended upon the nature of the metal and its surface condition. All three antibiotics appeared to stimulate the corrosion of Vitallium (cobalt-chromium alloy), but corrosion inhibition was found for as-received titanium with all three antibiotics, for abraded titanium with doxycycline and for stainless steel with oxytetracycline dihydrate.
