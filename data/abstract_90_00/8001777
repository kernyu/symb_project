Benzimidazole anthelmintics are the most common chemotherapeutic agents used to remove intestinal helminths from farm animals. The development of drug resistance within helminth populations is wide-spread and can render these drugs essentially useless. The mechanism of benzimidazole resistance appears to be common to many species ranging from fungi to nematodes and involves alterations in the genes encoding beta-tubulin. During the selection process resulting in resistance, there must be quantitative changes in the population gene pool. Knowledge of these changes would indicate the mechanisms underlying the spread of resistance in the population, which in turn could be used to design more effective drug administration strategies. To this end we have identified allelic variation at two beta-tubulin genes in Haemonchus contortus using restriction map analysis of individual adults. Extremely high levels of variation were identified at both loci within a susceptible strain. In two independently derived benzimidazole resistant strains, allele frequencies at both loci were significantly different from the susceptible strain but not from each other. The same alleles at both loci, in both resistant strains, were favored by selection with benzimidazoles, suggesting that both loci are involved in determining benzimidazole resistance. These data confirm that changes in allele frequency, rather than novel genetic rearrangements induced by exposure to the drug, explain the changes associated with benzimidazole resistance. These results also show that any DNA based test for the development of benzimidazole resistance must take into account the frequency of alleles present in the population and not simply test for the presence or absence of specific allelic types.
