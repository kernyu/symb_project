Constitutive expression of IFN-beta by HIV target cells may be an alternative or complementary therapeutic approach for the treatment of AIDS. We show that macrophages derived from CD34+ cells from umbilical cord blood can be efficiently transduced by a retroviral vector carrying the IFN-beta coding sequence. This results in resistance to infection by a macrophage-tropic HIV type 1, as shown by the drastic reduction in the HIV DNA copy number per cell and in p24 release. Moreover, IFN-beta transduction totally blocked secretion of proinflammatory cytokines after HIV infection. The constitutive IFN-beta production also resulted in an increased production of IL-12 and IFN-gamma Th1-type cytokines and of the beta-chemokines macrophage-inflammatory protein-1alpha, macrophage-inflammatory protein-1beta, and RANTES. RANTES was found to be involved in the HIV resistance observed, and this was correlated with a down-regulation of the CCR-5 HIV entry coreceptor. These results demonstrate the feasibility and the efficacy of such IFN-beta-mediated gene therapy. In addition to inhibiting HIV replication, IFN-beta transduction could have beneficial immune effects in HIV-infected patients by favoring cellular immune responses.
