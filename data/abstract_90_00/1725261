Strains containing a series of restrictive and non-restrictive mutations in ribosomal protein S12 have been transformed with plasmids carrying the rrnB operon with mutations at positions 1409 and 1491 in 16S rRNA. The effects of the double-mutant constructs have been measured by growth rate, paromomycin and streptomycin sensitivity, resistance and dependence. The results demonstrate a functional interaction between the 1409-1491 region of rRNA and ribosomal protein S12.
