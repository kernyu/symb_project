A 33 year old woman with recurrent Salmonella enteritidis sepsis is described. Penicillins, ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, and chloramphenicol could not eradicate the salmonellas but a combination of high dose ciprofloxacin and ceftriaxone for the eighth episode successfully cured the infection. The combination of ciprofloxacin and ceftriaxone may be a valuable therapeutic regimen in patients with recurrent salmonella sepsis. Prolonged intrahepatic cholestasis resulting from granulomatous hepatitis in this patient improved considerably with empiric ursodeoxycholic acid treatment. A liver biopsy specimen showing non-caseating epitheloid granulomas was positive for mycobacterial DNA by polymerase chain reaction. Repeated bronchoscopy with multiple biopsies eventually revealed caseating granulomas with acid fast bacilli in the lung biopsy specimens. Therefore, tuberculosis was diagnosed as the underlying disease and the cause of granulomatous hepatitis in this patient and tuberculostatic treatment was started. Polymerase chain reaction for mycobacterial DNA may be helpful in the differential diagnosis of hepatic granulomas when routine histological examination and culture of biopsy specimens are not diagnostic. Tuberculosis should be considered as one of the diseases predisposing to recurrent salmonella sepsis.
