The evolution of mechanisms of resistance to natural antimicrobial substances (antibiotics) was almost certainly concurrent with the development in microorganisms of the ability to synthesise such agents. Of the several general strategies adopted by bacteria for defence against antibiotics, one of the most pervasive is that of enzymic inactivation. The vast majority of eubacteria that are resistant to chloramphenicol, an inhibitor of prokaryotic protein synthesis, owe their resistance phenotype to genes for chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT), which catalyses O-acetylation of the antibiotic, using acetyl-CoA as the acyl donor. The structure of CAT is known, as are many of the properties of the enzyme which explain its remarkable specificity and catalytic efficiency. Less clear is the evolutionary pathway which has produced the different members of the CAT 'family' of enzymes. Hints come from other acetyltransferases which share structure and mechanistic features with CAT, while not being strictly 'homologous' at the level of amino acid sequence. The 'super-family' of trimeric acetyltransferases appears to have in common a chemical mechanism based on a shared architecture.
