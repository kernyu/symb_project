The activity of DU-6859a, a new fluoroquinolone antimicrobial agent, was compared with that of ciprofloxacin by agar dilution susceptibility testing against enteric pathogens and multiresistant Escherichia coli. The results indicate that DU-6859a inhibits most of these organisms at concentrations similar to those of ciprofloxacin. DU-6859a showed increased activity compared to ciprofloxacin against Campylobacter species isolates.
