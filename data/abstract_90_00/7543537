Protection against infection with intracellular pathogens operates in two stages, early innate resistance and late acquired protective immunity (API), in inbred mouse strains. Although both C57BL/10 (B10) and BALB/c mice bear the susceptible phenotype of innate resistance, Calmette-Guerin bacillus (BCG) vaccination generated efficient API in B10 but not in BALB/c mice. Employing a specific nitric oxide (NO) synthase inhibitor, we revealed that NO production plays a pivotal role in the API of B10 mice. Consistent with this, expressions of the inducible isoform of NO synthase (iNOS) protein and mRNA were significantly higher in the spleen of B10 mice than in that of BALB/c mice. Furthermore, IFN-gamma, a potent inducer of iNOS, and mRNAs for IL-12 (p40); an inducer of IFN-gamma and IL-2 were also vigorously expressed in the spleen of B10 mice compared with that of BALB/c mice. In an attempt to clarify the mechanism by which the different capacities for API are generated, we analyzed the cytokine network between T cells and macrophages in both B10 and BALB/c mice. We found that multiple functions of macrophages, which include capacities to express IL-12 (p40) mRNA in response to BCG and to express mRNAs for iNOS and IL-12 (p40) in response to IFN-gamma, were impaired in BALB/c mice as compared with B10 mice. However, T cells appeared to express comparable level of IFN-gamma mRNA in both strains when stimulated with IL-12. Taken together, these results indicate that the macrophage functions play a pivotal role in both the induction and effector phases of API to determine the susceptibility of mice to BCG infection.
