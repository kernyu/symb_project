Resistance to tetracycline is generally due either to energy-dependent efflux of tetracycline or to protection of the bacterial ribosomes from the action of tetracycline. The genes that encode this resistance are normally acquired via transferable plasmids and/or transposons. Tet determinants have been found in a wide range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and have reduced the effectiveness of therapy with tetracycline.
