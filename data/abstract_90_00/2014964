KP-736, a new cephen antibiotic with a broad antibacterial spectrum and potent antipseudomonal activity, was evaluated for in vitro antibacterial activity in comparison with ceftazidime, cefotaxime, and cefpirome. KP-736 was significantly more active than the test compounds against gram-negative bacteria, including the Pseudomonas group and ceftazidime-, cefotaxime-, or imipenem-resistant strains, but less active against gram-positive bacteria. KP-736 had very high affinities for penicillin-binding protein 3 (PBP 3) of Escherichia coli K-12 and PBP 1A and PBP 3 of Pseudomonas aerugiosa NCTC 10490 and showed potent bactericidal activities against these two strains. It was stable to hydrolysis by penicillinases and cephalosporinases but was slightly hydrolyzed by oxyiminocephalosporinases and type II penicillinase.
