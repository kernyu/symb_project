Leuconostoc sp. are gram-positive bacteria intrinsically resistant to vancomycin, which can be confused with streptococci based on routine microbiological-characteristics. Infections secondary to Leuconostoc are uncommon, and usually affect patients with underlying diseases, prior use of vancomycin and those with central lines. The most common clinical presentation is fever secondary to a central line infection. We report the first case of Leuconostoc infection in a solid organ transplant recipient. The patient developed Leuconostoc bacteremia secondary to peritonitis, 60 d after undergoing liver transplantation. He was treated with clindamycin, gentamicin and underwent surgical debridement, but succumbed to other complications.
