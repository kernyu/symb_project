The modalities of prevention and treatment of malaria in expatriates residing in Brazzaville, capital of the Congo, have been studied in March 1989, April 1990 and April 1992. These surveys of the type Behavior, Attitude, Practice have been carried out in the Ecole Francaise where the same questionnaire has been distributed among the primary school children to complete by their parents. Only the data pertaining to Europeans, Lebanese, and North-Americans are presented. The proportion of French expatriates is 80%. A progressive decrease is noticed in the regular taking of chemoprophylaxis: the percentage varies between 86 and 43% according ot the duration of residence in 1989, to between 57 and 16% in 1992. Chloroquine alone remains the most widely used product, especially in long term expatriates. The association chloroquine-proguanil is mentioned only by a quarter or respondents. Apparently efficient, it is especially taken by people exposed for less than 4 years. Amodiaquine, although contra-indicated for prevention purposes, is cited in 1992 by 9% of subjects taking regular chemoprophylaxis; other products are only exceptionally used. In curative treatment, which generally is presumptive, halofantrine is since 1990 the most widely used drug, especially in children. In contrast, a relative disclaimer is noted for the amino-4-quinolines, due to resistance, but also and with no justification, for the association sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine and, to a lesser degree, for quinine. The occurrence of attacks considered to be malarial and their frequency, remained stable during the period of study.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
