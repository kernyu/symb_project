Group-C beta-hemolytic streptococci (GCBHS) is an uncommon cause of bacteremia. In a 5-year period, GCBHS accounted for 0.28% of positive blood cultures and 0.35% of bacteremias documented at our hospital. The incidence of GCBHS bacteremia was 0.05 episodes per 1000 admissions. We were able to analyze clinical data of 10 of the 13 patients with GCBHS bacteremias. All but one were adults with significant underlying diseases, and seven episodes were community acquired. The skin was the portal of entry in only one case. Clinical syndromes included primary bacteremia (four cases), pneumonia (two cases), endocarditis (two cases), and meningitis, intraabdominal infection, and metastatic suppurative pericarditis (one episode each). Of 13 isolates, 12 were identified to species level: six, Streptococcus equisimilis; three S. equi; two S. dysgalactiae; and one S. zooepidemicus. Resistance to penicillin was detected in one isolate and none of our isolates displayed penicillin tolerance, Four patients died (40%) despite appropriate antimicrobial therapy.
