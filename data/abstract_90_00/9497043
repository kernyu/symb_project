The gene coding for the 30 kDa lysine rich surface antigen (Ed-Ag) that is present on membrane surfaces of Entamoeba dispar trophozoites has been characterized. A specific monoclonal antibody MAb 318-28 prepared against this antigen reacts with all E. dispar strains tested, but not with any of the antigens of E. histolytica. In order to understand the function of this antigen, we constructed two plasmids, pEdA-9 and pEdA-Rev, in which the antigen-coding sequence was introduced into the pEhAct-Neo shuttle vector in the direct and opposite orientation, respectively. When E. dispar trophozoites were transfected with pEdA-9, only a slight increase was observed in the expression of the antigen. However, when E. dispar trophozoites were transfected with pEdA-Rev, the expression of the native 30 kDa antigen was significantly inhibited. This inhibition was proportional to the level of resistance of the E. dispar culture to the neomycin derivative G418. Cytopathic assays detected only a slight difference between untransfected, pEdA-9 transfected and pEdA-Rev transfected trophozoites.
