A total of 17 strains of Pasteurella multocida, of which 13 were isolated from patients treated at Nihon University Itabashi Hospital or Nihon University Surugadai Hospital between April, 1984 and March, 1991 and 4 from 1 dog and 3 cats kept by the patients, were evaluated with respect to their biochemical properties, sensitivity to drugs, and serotype. The isolated strains were all considered to be Pasteurella multocida subsp. multocida because of the agreement of their responses to indole, sorbitol and dulcitol with those of this subspecies, except for 1 sorbitol-negative strain of Pasteurella multocida subsp. septica isolated from 1 patient who had been bitten by a cat. All the isolated strains showed high sensitivities to various drugs. The serotype was capsular type A, which is often observed in cats and dogs, in 7 strains, which consisted of 6 of the 7 strains derived from the airway of the patients and 1 of the 6 strains derived from bit or scratch wound. The remaining strains could not be classified. Five morphological types, namely 1, 3, 3.8, 6, and 8 were observed. In 2 patients, Pasteurella multocida subsp. multocida of the same serotype was also isolated from their cats. One of these patients had intimate contact with the cat including kissing. Our findings suggest that: 1) Pasteurella multocida subsp. multocida has been responsible for most conventional cases of Pasteurella multocida infection. 2) Strains isolated from patients differ in the capsular type according to the disease.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
