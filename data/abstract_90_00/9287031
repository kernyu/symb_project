IS1373 is the putative insertion sequence delimiting the amplifiable unit AUD2 of Streptomyces lividans. Two IS1373-derived thiostrepton-resistant transposons, Tn5492 and Tn5494, transposed into multiple sites of the S. lividans chromosome at frequencies as high as 0.4 and 1%, respectively. Hence, IS1373 is a functional insertion sequence and its unique open reading frame, insA, encodes the transposase.
