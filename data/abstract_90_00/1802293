The paper reports on the case of a 50-year-old patient with purulent meningitis caused by H. influenza type C, previously clinically healthy, without other associated disease. The disease had a mild evolution and the patient was cured after 7 days of etiologic and pathogenic treatment. The isolated strain was serotyped by the agglutination reactions on slides, coagglutination, counterimmunoelectrophoresis, and double immunodiffusion--being C serotype, and biotyped--being I serotype, sensitive to ampicillin, chloramphenicol and tetracycline and resistant to kanamicine and rifampicine.
