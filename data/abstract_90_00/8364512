Iontophoretic and passive transport of an ionized drug (sulfisoxazole) across excised rat skin was studied using a two-chamber cell with four electrodes under successive experimental conditions: without electrical current (stage-I) and with electrical current (stage-II). Two iontophoretic/diffusion models, i.e. a one-layer membrane model and a two-layer membrane model, in which a difference in the electrical potential gradient was taken into account between the stratum corneum and epidermis/dermis layer, were constructed to describe the non-steady-state drug permeation process during ionotrophoresis. The observed iontophoretic lag-time was two times greater than the calculated value based on the one-layer membrane model. According to the two-layer membrane model, the calculated ionotophoretic lag-time agreed with the observed value. It was revealed by model adaptation to the observed data that the stratum corneum fraction of the electro-chemical potential difference across the whole skin caused by the iontophoresis was around 90%. This result was consistent with the observation that the direct current resistance of whole skin was seven times greater than that of stripped skin.
