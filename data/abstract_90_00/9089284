Von Willebrand factor (vWF) is an essential multimeric protein for adhesion of platelets to an injured vessel wall. Endothelial cells secrete vWF by either a constitutive or a regulated pathway. It is unknown whether the secretory partitioning of vWF is dependent on the level of vWF synthesis. We employed the widely applied tetracycline-controlled transactivator system (tTA) to study the regulation of vWF mRNA synthesis in stably transfected Madin Darby kidney (MDCK-II) cells in a quantitative manner. Immunofluorescence staining with anti-vWF antibodies revealed that increasing the concentration of tetracycline resulted in a decreased number of MDCK-II cells that synthesize vWF. Apparently, tTA-regulated gene expression in an individual cell functions as an 'on/off' system rather than regulating the level of gene expression in a dose-response manner, as reported previously.
