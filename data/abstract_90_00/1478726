Among the 157 children with culture proven pyogenic meningitis who were admitted during 1987-1991, in the Department of Child Health at the Christian Medical College and Hospital, Vellore, 40 had H. influenzae type b (HIB) meningitis; 17 of these had multiantimicrobial resistant HIB (MRHIB) and 23 others had usual susceptibility HIB (USHIB) meningitis. The two groups were compared. Children with MRHIB meningitis who received optimal treatment with cefotaxime had excellent recovery. When cefotaxime therapy was delayed, mortality was noted in all except one child who survived with severe neurological sequelae. MRHIB meningitis treated with drugs other than cefotaxime had 100 per cent mortality. Cefotaxime is therefore recommended in children below 3 yr of age presenting with purulent meningitis, as MRHIB is a possible causative agent in this group.
