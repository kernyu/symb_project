Resistance to antimicrobial agents of 106 isolates of motile Aeromonas sp. was characterized. The results indicated that in vitro susceptibilities among the three species of the motile Aeromonas sp. were similar, and only the distribution of susceptibility to cephalothin was different. The percentage of resistance of A. sobria strains was lower than the percentage of the resistant strains of A. hydrophila and A. caviae. All of the isolates were susceptible to kanamycin, nalidixic acid, tobramycin, amikacin, netilmicin, cefuroxime, ceftriaxone, cefoperazone and cefotaxime. Three of the tested strains (two A. hydrophila and one A. caviae) transferred resistance plasmids to the Aeromonas hydrophila recipient.
