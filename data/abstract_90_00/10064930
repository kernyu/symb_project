Triple therapy (omeprazole, clarithromycin and metronidazole) is associated with a sensitive Helicobacter pylori (HP) eradication rate of over 90 per cent. As treatment failure is mainly due to poor patient compliance, satisfactory patient information is vital. Despite the high prevalence (29-40%) of metronidazole-resistant HP in Malmo, the eradication rate is over 90%. Clarithromycin-resistance among HP strains has increased in prevalence from 1 to 7% over the past four years, and always results in treatment failure. In order to avoid unnecessary antibiotic treatment, especially in cases of patients not responding to triple therapy, it is important to follow treatment up with, for example, the urea breath test.
