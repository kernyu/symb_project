To assess the activities of two glycylcyclines, N,N-dimethylglycylamido (DMG) derivatives of minocycline (MINO) and 6-demethyl-6-deoxytetracycline (DMDOT), 203 gonococcal isolates recovered at six sexually transmitted disease clinics in the western United States were evaluated. Antimicrobial susceptibilities to tetracycline HCl, doxycycline, MINO, DMG-DMDOT, and DMG-MINO were determined by agar dilution tests. DMG-DMDOT and DMG-MINO were more active than tetracycline HCl, doxycycline, or MINO regardless of the presence of Tet M or of chromosomal mutations mediating tetracycline resistance (P < 0.001).
