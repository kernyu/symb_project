The clinical effectiveness of flucytosine (5-FC) was evaluated in 52 patients with urinary fungal infections which were diagnosed because of the presence of both funguria (greater than or equal to 10(4) cfu/ml) and pyuria (greater than or equal to 5 WBC/hpf). The patients received oral daily doses of 5-FC ranging 20 to 150 mg/kg, with a mean treatment duration of 11 days. The 57 fungus strains isolated from urine specimens consisted of 51 Candida spp. including 28 Candida albicans, 10 Candida glabrata, 4 Candida tropicalis and 6 Trichosporon beigelii. Forty-seven (92.2%) and 4 (66.7%) of the 51 Candida spp. and 6 T. beigelii strains isolated were eradicated by the treatment, respectively, giving an overall eradication rate of 89.5%. Clinical responses in 32 patients, from whom only fungi were submitted, were excellent in 5, moderate in 22, and poor in 5, thus the overall efficacy rate was 84.4%, based on the criteria of Japanese UTI Committee. Of the 18 strains of Candida spp. tested, 5-FC showed 0.20 micrograms/ml or less of the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) against 16 strains and higher than 100 micrograms/ml against the remaining 2 strains. The MICs of the 5 T. beigelii strains tested were between 3.12 and 6.25 micrograms/ml. As adverse reactions, only 2 patients (3.8%) experienced diarrhea but did not require treatment cessation. These results suggest that flucytosine is an effective drug for urinary fungal infections.
