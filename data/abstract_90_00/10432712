Cytotoxic and antiretroviral activity of cycloSal-d4TMP derivatives were tested in a new AZT-resistant H9 cell subline (H9rAZT250). The results showed, that cycloSal-d4TMP derivatives overcame resistance of HIV-1 to d4T in H9rAZT250 cells, which exert decreased thymidine kinase (TK) gene expression.
