The use of established fluoroquinolones, such as ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin, as empirical therapy for the treatment of moderate-to-severe respiratory tract infections is limited by their poor activity against gram-positive and atypical pathogens. Data from in vitro susceptibility studies and in vivo animal protection models suggest that the new fluoroquinolone, trovafloxacin, compared with ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin offers equivalent activity against gram-negative pathogens and improved activity against gram-positive pathogens. In particular, susceptibility data indicate that trovafloxacin is at least 16-fold more potent than either ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin against penicillin-susceptible and penicillin-resistant strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae. Other susceptible pathogens include Streptococcus pyogenes, vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecalis and the atypical respiratory pathogens Legionella pneumophila, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydia pneumoniae. In vivo studies involving models of protection against acute systemic infection and pneumococcal pneumonia in mice, and Legionnaires' disease in guinea pigs, indicate that the antibacterial spectrum observed for trovafloxacin in vitro extends to the in vivo setting. Together, these findings suggest that trovafloxacin may offer clinical efficacy against respiratory pathogens superior to that of ciprofloxacin and of ofloxacin, and may find a useful role as empiric therapy in both the community and hospital setting.
