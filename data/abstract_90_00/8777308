After a decade of research, Helicobacter pylori eradication is still a problem because of the steady increase of bacterial resistance (imidazole, macrolides), pH-dependent efficiency of antibiotics, poor compliance of patients and frequent side effects of the therapies. After the failure of various monotherapies and the unefficiency of Amoxicillin-Imidazole combination for Imidazole-resistant strains, the two weeks inverted question markOral Triple Therapy' with a 85% mean eradication rate, was abandoned because of a mean 35% side effects rate. The current goal is to obtain 90% eradication rate and the excellent results of german studies with a 2 weeks regimen combining a Proton Pump Inhibitor (PPI) with Amoxicillin have not been confirmed elsewhere in Europe. PPI plus Clarithromycin (two weeks) gave a mean 72% eradication rate on an ITT basis. The short, low-dose combination PPI-Clarithromycin-Imidazole for one week proposed by Bazzoli is very efficient in a population where Imidazole resistant strains are rare. The recent result of one week with (Omeprazole 20-Clarithromycin 250-Tinidazole 500) BID or (Omeprazole 20-Clarithromycin 500-Amoxi 1000) BID reached a 95% eradication rate but these very promising results are not confirmed in Belgium in an on-going study including 147 patients.
