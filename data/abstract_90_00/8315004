The DNAs of 3* vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium isolates from five hospitals in three states were analyzed by contour-clamped homogeneous electric field electrophoresis and plasmid analysis. There were 22 strain types. One strain type was common to patients in three hospitals in two states. These results suggest the apparent intra- and interhospital spread of vancomycin-resistant E. faecium.
