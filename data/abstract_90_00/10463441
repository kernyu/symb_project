Individual and combined antimicrobial effects of monolaurin and acetic acid on Listeria monocytogenes planktonic cells or stainless-steel-adherent cells were determined in order to evaluate cell viability during a 25-min exposure period at 25 degrees C. A 10(7)-colony-forming units (CFU)/ml population of planktonic cells was completely inactivated by the synergistic combination of 1% acetic acid with 50 or 100 microg/ml of monolaurin within 25 or 20 min, respectively. Either compound alone caused partial but incomplete inactivation within the same time periods. A population of 10(5) CFU/cm2 of 1-day adherent cells on stainless steel was completely inactivated within 25 min, but with the highest concentrations of the combined chemicals, i.e., 1% acetic acid and 100 microg/ml of monolaurin. The combined chemical treatment again synergistically produced greater inhibition. A 10(6)-CFU/cm2 population of 7-day adherent cells was not completely inactivated within 25 min of exposure, although counts did decline. The results demonstrate increased resistance of attached L. monocytogenes to acetic acid and monolaurin and show that resistance increased with culture age. Combinations of organic acids and monolaurin might be considered as sanitizers of food contact surfaces, but activities of such combinations are likely to be less than other commonly used sanitizers.
