In contrast with other macrophage (MO) populations, there is little information on the antiviral resistance in vitro of isolated liver MO (Kupffer cells, KC). We have demonstrated that the KC exhibits marked intrinsic resistance to infection in vitro with herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1). Liver and peritoneal MO (PMO) were harvested from untreated mice (naive), from mice treated with drug vehicle, or from mice treated with either a synthetic nonspecific immunomodulator, maleic anhydride divinyl ether copolymer (MVE-2), or with MO colony-stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1). The studies revealed that resident KC, isolated by two different methods, are equally as nonpermissive for infection with HSV-1 as are resident PMO. When infected with HSV-1, resident KC showed no cytopathic effect, and no infectious virus was produced. Intravenous (i.v.) treatment of mice with MVE-2 (50 mg/kg 3 days before cell harvest) increased the number of KC recovered. However, neither i.v. treatment with MVE-2 nor CSF-1 (20,000 U daily for 4 days) had any pronounced effect on the permissiveness of KC or PMO to infection with HSV-1. These data support a role for KC in host antiviral resistance, and indicate that KC intrinsic antiviral resistance is maintained during immunotherapy with MVE-2 or CSF-1.
