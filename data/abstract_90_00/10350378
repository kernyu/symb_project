Using a diffusion chamber in rabbits, we evaluated therapy with the combination of ceftriaxone plus the beta-lactamase inhibitor tazobactam in comparison with ceftriaxone alone. One sensitive and one resistant strain of Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae and Klebsiella pneumoniae were inoculated into one of the six diffusion chambers, implanted in the same animal. In order to simulate pharmacokinetics in humans, both substances were administered in decreasing doses. Ceftriaxone was given 0, 2, 4 and 6 h after infection in dosages of 45, 35, 25 and 15 mg/kg of body weight, while tazobactam was administered either in one dose at 0 h, or divided into two doses at 0 and 1 h or 0 and 4 h, or divided into three doses at 0, 1 and 4 h after infection. The ratio of ceftriaxone:tazobactam was fixed at 8:1. Ceftriaxone, in combination with tazobactam, given in one dose immediately after infection showed a significant reduction in bacterial count. All other combinations of ceftriaxone and tazobactam did not differ from ceftriaxone in monotherapy. Co-administration of the beta-lactamase inhibitor tazobactam significantly enhanced the activity of ceftriaxone against all three tested species.
