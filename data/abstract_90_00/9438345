A total of 228 bacteria with an ability to resist toxic heavy metals were isolated from 8 selected sites of the Lagos Lagoon. The bacteria isolated were Staphylococcus sp., Bacillus sp., Pseudomonas sp., Streptococcus sp., Moraxella sp., Escherichia coli, Proteus sp., Klebsiella sp. and Salmonella sp. The heavy metals to which resistance was recorded were mercury, lead, zinc, cobalt, copper and chromium. The lagoon sites from which the highest number of resistant bacteria were isolated were Marina and Ebute-Ero. The heavy metal to which most bacteria were resistant was cobalt, while the least was chromium. The significance of the result is discussed in relation to the Nigerian environment and human health.
