Recent reports suggest that lower levels of chloroquine accumulation in chloroquine-resistant isolates of Plasmodium falciparum are achieved by energy-dependent chloroquine efflux from resistant parasites. In support of this argument, a rapid chloroquine efflux phenotype has been observed in some chloroquine-resistant isolates of P. falciparum. In this study, no relationship was found between chloroquine sensitivity and the rate of [3H]chloroquine efflux from four isolates of P. falciparum with a greater than 10-fold range in sensitivity to chloroquine. All the isolates tested displayed the rapid efflux phenotype, irrespective of sensitivity. However, chloroquine sensitivity of these isolates was correlated with energy-dependent rate of drug accumulation into these parasites. Verapamil and a variety of other compounds reverse chloroquine resistance. The reversal mechanism is assumed to result from competition between verapamil and chloroquine for efflux protein translocation sites, thus causing an increase in steady-state accumulation of chloroquine and hence a return to sensitivity. Verapamil accumulation at a steady-state is increased by chloroquine, possibly indicating competition for efflux of the two substrates. Increases in steady-state verapamil concentrations caused by chloroquine were identical in sensitive and resistant strains, suggesting that similar capacity efflux pumps may exist in these isolates. These data suggest that differences in steady-state chloroquine accumulation seen in these isolates can be attributed to changes in the chloroquine concentrating mechanism rather than the efflux pump. It seems likely that chloroquine resistance generally in P. falciparum, results at least in part from a change in the drug concentrating mechanism and that changes in efflux rates per se are insufficient to explain chloroquine resistance.
