The effects of the membrane-stabilizing agent, alpha-tocopherol (25 microg/ml), on the chemosensitizing interactions of cyclosporin A (5 microg/ml), verapamil (2 microg/ml), clofazimine (1 microg/ml), B669 (0.5 microg/ml) and GF120918 (0.015 microg/ml) with a P-glycoprotein-expressing human lung cancer cell line (H69/LX4) have been investigated in vitro. In an assay of cell proliferation, all the chemosensitizing agents restored the sensitivity of H69/LX4 cells to doxorubicin and vinblastine. The inclusion of alpha-tocopherol (25 microg/ml) antagonized the multidrug-resistance (MDR)-modifying activity of all five chemosensitizing agents, effectively preventing restoration of sensitivity to both doxorubicin and vinblastine in H69/LX4 cells.
