A 50-year-old female was admitted with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) in August, 1988. She was treated with behenoyl-ara-C, daunomycin, 6-mercaptopurine and prednisolone (BH-AC.DMP), which led to a complete remission. Thereafter, she was treated with 2 courses of BH-AC.DM and discharged from hospital. Intensification therapy was performed twice a year, with 1 course of BH-AC.DM and 5 courses of intermittent-dose ara-C/mitoxantrone which ended in March, 1992. She had a relapse in September, 1993 and was treated with all-trans retinoic acid, which led to a second remission. A second relapse occurred in May, 1994, and intermittent-dose ara-C/mitoxantrone, combined with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), led to a third remission. However, she had a third relapse in September, 1994. She was treated with a trial of G-CSF (300 micrograms/body, day 1-7), to stimulate dormant leukemic cells to enter the cell cycle, and cyclosporin-A (78 mg/kg, day 2-5), in order to overcome daunomycin resistance in refractory leukemia, combined with daunomycin (45 mg/m2, day 3-5) and ara-C (1.4 g/m2, day 3-7), after obtaining informed consent. The fourth remission needed 46 days after combination chemotherapy because of severe myelosuppression. It was suggested that intermittent-dose ara-C/daunomycin therapy combined with G-CSF and cyclosporin-A may be useful for relapsed and refractory leukemia.
