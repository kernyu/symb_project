The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that only heat sterilization be used for all reusable devices entering the oral cavity. However, chemical disinfection is still employed for reprocessing dental devices in many areas of the world. In an analysis of a Florida dental practice responsible for nosocomial human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmissions, the possible role of contaminated devices was deemed unlikely in part because they were subjected to high-level disinfection with 2% glutaraldehyde. Disease transmissions have, however, been documented for endoscopes used in diagnostic and surgical procedures even after this treatment. In some dental devices, lubricants mix with potentially infectious patient materials, and organic debris has been observed in endoscopes after cleaning. We have investigated whether lubricants can render high-level chemical disinfection procedures ineffective and have addressed the role that some common devices may play in disease transmission. We report here that HIV in whole-blood samples and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in blood and plasma survived high-level disinfection when entrapped in lubricants used in dental handpieces and endoscopes. We also found that lubricated dental devices used to clean and polish teeth (prophylaxis angles) have the potential to transfer sufficient amounts of blood to infect human lymphocyte cultures with HIV. These results emphasize the need to subject reusable dental devices to a heat-sterilization protocol that penetrates the lubricant.
