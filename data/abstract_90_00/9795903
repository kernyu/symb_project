Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae is the causative agent of swine erysipelas. Although an attenuated vaccine is used in Japan, recent increases in disease occurrence have cast doubts on its efficacy. We investigated the similarity between the vaccine strain and E. rhusiopathiae field isolates by the analysis of acriflavine resistance (the vaccine strain marker), serotype, DNA fingerprinting and pathogenicity to mice. Although 7 acriflavine resistant E. rhusiopathiae isolates were separated from arthritic lesions of slaughter pigs, we were unable to prove that they were identical to the vaccine strain.
