BACKGROUND: Insulin resistance and glucose intolerance are a major feature of patients with liver cirrhosis. However, site and mechanism of insulin resistance in cirrhosis are unknown. We investigated insulin-induced glucose metabolism of skeletal muscle by positron-emission tomography to identify possible defects of muscle glucose metabolism in these patients. METHODS: Whole body glucose disposal and oxidation were determined by the combined use of the euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp technique (insulin infusion rate: 1 mU/kg body wt per min) and indirect calorimetry in seven patients with biopsy-proven liver cirrhosis (Child: 1A, 5B, and 1C) and five healthy volunteers. Muscle glucose uptake of the thighs was measured simultaneously by dynamic [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron-emission tomography scan. RESULTS: Both whole body and nonoxidative glucose disposal were significantly reduced in patients with liver cirrhosis (by 48%, P < 0.001, and 79%, P < 0.0001, respectively), whereas glucose oxidation and the increase in plasma lactate were normal. Concomitantly, skeletal muscle glucose uptake was reduced by 69% in liver cirrhosis (P < 0.003) and explained 55 or 92% of whole body glucose disposal in cirrhotics and controls, respectively. Analysis of kinetic constants using a three-compartment model further indicated reduced glucose transport (P < 0.05) but unchanged phosphorylation of glucose in patients with liver cirrhosis. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with liver cirrhosis show significant insulin resistance that is characterized by both decreased glucose transport and decreased nonoxidative glucose metabolism in skeletal muscle.
