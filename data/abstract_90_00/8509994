Whether or not resistance to macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin type B antibiotics (MLS) can be induced by many macrolide antibiotics (Mac), was inquired in Bacillus licheniformis EMR. Resistance to MLS in the strain was induced by erythromycin, oleandomycin, clarithromycin, roxithromycin, narbomycin, picromycin, kujimycin A or B, mycinamicin I, or rosamicin. On the contrary, josamycin, spiramycin, tylosin, rokitamycin, midecamycin, and miokamycin as well as lincosamide and streptogramin type B antibiotics could not induce MLS-resistance. The results suggest that two common chemical residues of the inducer Mac, that is, 1) a single monosaccharide at C5 in the 14- and 16-membered lactone rings, and 2) one polar group such as dimethylamino or methoxyl at C3' in the sugar, are likely to be responsible for showing the activity of MLS-resistance inducer in Bacillus licheniformis EMR.
