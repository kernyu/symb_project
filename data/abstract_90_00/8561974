OBJECTIVE: To explore the possibility of gene therapy of HIV infection based on the multiple antiretroviral activities of interferon (IFN)-beta. DESIGN: We introduced into HIV target cells an IFN-beta gene placed under an expression control ensuring a low and constitutive expression, sufficient to confer a permanent antiviral state without impeding normal cell function. METHODS: We transformed, with an efficacy ranging from 20-55%, peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) derived from healthy, seronegative donors, and from asymptomatic HIV-infected individuals by the HMB-KbHuIFN beta retroviral vector carrying the human IFN-beta coding sequence driven by a fragment of the murine H-2Kb gene promoter. RESULTS: The replication rate of the IFN-beta-expressing cells was no different from that of untransformed controls during the 21-day period of in vitro observation. When IFN-beta-transformed, purified CD4+ lymphocytes from healthy donors were HIV-1LAI-infected, virus replication was inhibited and most of the cells survived, in contrast to untransformed CD4+ cells which were all destroyed 12 days after infection. Protection of CD4+ cells from the same donors was also observed in suspensions of IFN-beta-transformed total PBL that were infected with HIV-1LAI. In IFN-beta-transformed PBL from four HIV-infected donors, endogenous HIV replication was decreased and 28-69% of the CD4+ cells survived at the end of the 21 days in culture. In the untransformed control PBL suspensions, all CD4+ cells were destroyed. In long-term experiments, HIV-infected, IFN-beta-transformed cell populations of the lymphocytic CEM and the promonocytic U937 line were kept in culture for 60 days, during which time they remained resistant to HIV infection. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that further exploration of autocrine IFN-beta production for somatic cell gene therapy of HIV infection is warranted.
