117 pure bacterial cultures of numerous species isolated by the authors at acute postnatal pyo-catarrhal cattle endometritis have been studied for their virulence and resistance to 18 antibiotics with the aim to determine their etiologic role in the development of the given pathology and to make a prediction estimation of possible therapeutic and preventive efficiency of the antibiotics. The experiments on white mice have revealed pathogenic properties and virulence in most studied strains of bacteria of different species. The studied microflora is, mainly, resistant practically to all 18 tested antibiotics. A direct dependence is established between virulence of the microflora, isolated in case of endometritis, and its resistance to antibiotics.
