BACKGROUND: An increase in multiple drug-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae due to extended spectrum beta-lactamase production has recently been reported from many centers around the world. There is no information in the literature regarding this problem in Israel. A high prevalence of ceftazidime-resistant K. pneumoniae was noted in our Intensive Care Unit in the first few months of 1995. OBJECTIVE: To describe the epidemiology of ceftazidime-resistant K. pneumoniae in our medical center, as representing the situation in tertiary care hospitals in Israel. METHODS: We vigorously restricted the use of ceftazidime in the ICU and enforced barrier precautions. The susceptibility rate of K. pneumoniae was surveyed in the ICU and throughout the hospital before and after the intervention in the ICU. RESULTS: Following the intervention, the susceptibility rate of K. pneumoniae increased from 11% (3/28) to 47% (14/30) (P < 0.01) among ICU isolates, from 55% (154/280) to 62% (175/281) (P = 0.08) among total hospital isolates, and from 61% (50/82) to 74% (84/113) (P < 0.05) among total hospital blood isolates, although no additional control measures were employed outside the ICU. CONCLUSIONS: The epidemiology of ceftazidime-resistant K. pneumoniae in our medical center is similar to that reported from other centers around the world. Early awareness to the emergence of this resistance, identification of the source of the epidemic, and prompt action at the putative source site may reduce the rate of acquisition and spread of such resistance inside and outside of the source unit.
