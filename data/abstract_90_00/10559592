We report a case of bilateral intertrigo of the third and fourth interdigital spaces of the feet in a 34-year-old immunocompetent Senegalese male. A diagnosis of Fusarium solani infection was made. Systemic and topical therapy with terbinafine led to clinical but not mycological recovery. As this mould is potentially dangerous for immunodepressed subjects, early diagnosis and rigorous follow-up of skin diseases caused by this agent are advisable.
