Staphylococcus aureus menadione and hemin auxotrophs, generated by in vitro gentamicin selection, demonstrated reduced hemolytic activity and enhanced intracellular survival within cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells relative to their hemolytic parent. Supplementation of the auxotrophs with exogenous menadione or hemin resulted in rapid growth, increased hemolytic activity, and reduced intracellular persistence to the level found for the hemolytic clinical parent. Aminoglycoside selection of staphylococcal menadione and hemin auxotrophs and subsequent persistence of these variants in the intracellular milieu may adapt S. aureus for evasion of host defenses and resistance to antimicrobial therapy.
