The serogroup/serotypes (SGTs) and antimicrobial susceptibilities to 10 antimicrobial agents of 110 clinical strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae were determined. Strains intermediately resistant or highly resistant to penicillin G (80 of 110) belonged predominantly to SGTs 23 (45.0%), 19 (13.7%), 6 (10.0%), 9 (6.2%), and 14 (3.7%). The MICs of all cephalosporins, tetracycline, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and chloramphenicol increased along with the MICs of penicillin G. However, erythromycin resistance and clindamycin resistance were observed more frequently among the intermediately penicillin-resistant strains. Multiple resistance was observed for 32 strains, of which 25 were highly resistant to penicillin G and belong to SGT 23F. All strains were susceptible to vancomycin.
