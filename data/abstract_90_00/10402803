In an attempt to limit the spread of penicillin non-susceptible pneumococci (PNSP) in southern Sweden, early in 1995 an intervention project was launched, using a combination of traditional communicable disease control measures and actions aimed at reducing antibiotics consumption. Patients carrying PNSP (penicillin G MIC (0.5 mg/L) are monitored with nasopharyngeal cultures until PNSP-negative. Pre-school children are kept home from group day-care facilities. Previous antibiotic consumption was identified as a risk factor for PNSP carriage. Antibiotics sales decreased during the study period, and epidemiological findings suggest the dissemination of PNSP in the area to have been reduced by the intervention project.
