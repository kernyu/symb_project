The sensitivity of 415 microbial strains isolated from clinically taken samples from gynecologically diseased women was determined. The urine strains showed sensitivity up to 93.3%, but 7 Gram/-/ strains isolated in the last 3 months of the study were resistant to Ciprofloxacin. The cervical secretion strains, those of CD aspirates, of IUP and wound secretions were found sensitive up to 81.2%. The 50 Enterococcus strains isolated in gynecological infections were found in 28% resistant to Ciprofloxacin, with 7 of the 19 resistant strains were isolated in the last 3 months of the study. The appearance of resistant strains in some microbial species, pointed out in the literature as markedly sensitivity to Ciprofloxacin, as well as the data of a fast developed resistance Ciprofloxacin in the course of treatment, allowed us to recommend their application in the infections caused by microorganisms resistant to the habitual antibiotics.
