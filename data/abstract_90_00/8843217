The recombinant cytokines interferon (IFN)-gamma and interleukin (IL)-12 stimulate several macrophage-mediated functions that are important in host defense. An experimental pertussis model showed that intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of 10,000 U of recombinant murine (rm) IFN-gamma to mice at the time of Bordetella pertussis infection caused a marked and significant reduction in the number of colony-forming units of bacteria in the lungs. Administration i.p. of 1 microgram of rmIL-12 or 1 microgram of rmIL-12 at the time of and for 5 consecutive days after B. pertussis challenge also induced a significant reduction in the number. However, i.p. administration of 1 microgram of rmIL-12 with 10,000 U of IFN-gamma at the time of B. pertussis challenge did not provide protection. These findings indicate that exogenous administration of rmIL-12 and rmIFN-gamma enhances resistance of mice to B. pertussis infection.
