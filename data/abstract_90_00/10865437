1862 clinical specimens from neonates with infection risk factors treated in the Department of Neonatology, University of Cracow were examined. The aim of this study was to investigate the participation of clinically important Gram-negative rods in hospital infections and to check the resistance patterns of these pathogens. The strains were identified in automatic ATB system using ID 32E and ID 32GN strips with biochemical tests. The susceptibility of isolates of antibacterial agents was determined in automatic ATB system using ATB G- and ATB PSE strips. 436 strains of Gram-negative rods were cultured. 289 strains (66.3%) belonging to Entero-bacteriaceae family and 147 strains (33.7%) non-fermenting rods were isolated. Among Gram-negative aerobic fermenting rods (mainly K. pneumoniae and E. cloacae), increasing resistance to aminoglycosides and beta-lactams, due to new broad spectrum and so called inducible beta-lactamases, was observed. The contribution of non-fermenting rods, especially Pseudomonas spp. and Acinetobacter spp. to the aetiology of infections in hospitalized newborns has increased. Carbapenems and fluoroquinolones are highly active in vitro against the examined strains of multiresistant Gram-negative rods.
