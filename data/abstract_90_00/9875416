Structure-activity relationship of 20 fluoroquinolones was studied using the susceptible and 4 resistant Escherichia coli which were developed against 4 fluoroquinolones [ciprofloxacin (1), KR-10755 (6), norfloxacin (2), and ofloxacin (3)] in our laboratory. The C-7 and C-8 substituents of fluoroquinolone were important in various functions such as the inhibitory activity on DNA gyrase, permeability, and efflux. Among 20 fluoroquinolones, compounds with a 3-methyl-3,7-diazabicyclo[3.3.0]octan-1(5)-ene-7-yl substituent at the C-7 position or a chlorine substituent at the C-8 position showed a good inhibitory activity on DNA gyrase (especially a mutated DNA gyrase). Compounds with a 3,7-diazabicyclo [3.3.0]octan-1(5)-ene-7-yl substituent at the C-7 position showed good permeability in the susceptible and resistant strains, while compounds with a fluorine substituent at the C-8 position were less effluxed from cells.
