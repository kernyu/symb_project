A cross-sectional study was conducted, between June and November 1993, to determine the prevalence of Salmonella excretion in a representative sample (n = 300) of adult cattle, chosen by strict random sampling of the isolated bovine population in Gozo. Salmonellae were found in 41.3% of the cattle investigated, and seven animals yielded multiple Salmonella serovars. The total number of Salmonella isolates was 131. These included Salmonella Croft (55 isolates), S. Telaviv (29), S. Montevideo (17), S. Kpeme (7), S. Infantis (2) and S. Abadina (1). A seventh serovar (14 isolates) was found to have a novel antigenic structure: the name S. Gozo was proposed, and was accepted by the World Health Organisation Salmonella Reference Centre. All isolates were sensitive to four antibiotics, while 43% of the Salmonella strains were sensitive to nine antibiotics. No resistance was detected to cefuroxime, ciprofloxacin and gentamicin.
