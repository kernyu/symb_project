Recently, in daily newspapers and on television, attention of the audience has been focused on the overuse of antibiotics and on the role it plays in the emergence and dissemination of resistance mechanisms in the human environment. The role of food from animal origin in relation to the use of antibiotic resistance, infectious diseases, medical practice and ENT infections have accepted to answer a series of questions concerning risks versus usefulness of antibiotic usage. From the answers, we may note convergent views and discrepancies: (i) there was agreement concerning the unnecessary prescription of antibiotics in rhinopharyngitis and few other common viral infections; (ii) the risk of misuse of antibiotics in patients with poor compliance and further risk of erroneous self prescription of the remaining tablets has been cited; (iii) in the problem of resistance resulting from growth promoting antibiotics in animals, it has been experimentally shown that from 2 bacteria of the same species introduced in the animal gut, one susceptible, the other resistant, the latter will be eliminated by means of the "barrier effect"; similarly in case of transfer of resistance from an exogenous bacteria to a "resident" organism of the gut, the latter will be eliminated by the homologous susceptible ones; only an antibiotic therapy may confer importance to the resistant bacteria. In this respect, care should be taken for resistance spread such as that concerning penicillin-resistant pneumococci and surveillance and control of resistance mechanisms has become necessary. However we should look with reluctance at the diffusion of inevitably simplified and truncated information from Media, showing the negative aspects of antibiotics only. Moreover, as underlined by the expert from the Institut Pasteur, there are new perspectives in the development of effective new agents based on the modern "genomic" research.
