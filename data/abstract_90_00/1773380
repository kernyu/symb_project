This paper reports common pathogens in burn infection and changes in their drug sensitivity from 1985 to 1988. Gram negative rods constituted 55.7% of all pathogens, while 40.5% were gram positive cocci. The former group consisted of 173 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (28.5%), 55 Proteus (9.1%), 33 Serratia (5.4%), 23 Klebsiella (3.8%) 19, Acinetobacter (3.1%), 18 Enterobacter (3.0%) and 17 E. coli (2.8%). Among gram-positive cocci, Staphylococcus aureus accounted for 32.8%, Staphylococcus epidermidis accounted for 5.6%, and Streptococcus faecalis accounted for 2.1%. All the gram-negative rods and gram-positive cocci showed more resistance against various antibiotics. Ps. aeruginosa were resistant to 24 commonly used antibiotics. However, ciprofloxacin, ceftaztdime and piperacillin were comparatively effective, the sensitivity rates were 92.9%, 91.5% and 78.3%, respectively. Ps. aeruginosa showed a sensitivity rate of 92.5% and 86.1% to amikacin and polymyxin-B, respectively, from 1980 to 1984, but the rates were lowered to 65.9% and 17.3%, respectively, from 1985 to 1988. Staphylococcus aureus showed a sensitivity rate of 88.9% to ciprofloxacin, 76.1% to ceftazidime, 71.4% to amikacin, 48.5% to piperacillin, 63.1% to cefuroxime. This organism showed a sensitivity rate of 87.3%, 83.9%, 81.7% and 82.8% to amikacin, cefoperozone, leucomycin and lincomycin, respectively, from 1980 to 1984, but the sensitivity rates declined to 71.4%, 56.8%, 60.8% and 43.7%, respectively, from 1985 to 1988.
