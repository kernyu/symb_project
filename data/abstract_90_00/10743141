The relationship between nasal airflow sensation and nasal patency was evaluated by means of visual analogue test and anterior rhinomanometry. It was demonstrated that there is no significant correlation between the subjective sensation of nasal airflow and objective assessment of nasal airflow resistance. The site responsible for sensing airflow is located in the nasal vestibule. The volatile agents used in traditional Chinese medicine for nasal obstruction, such as camphor and menthol, could only improve the nasal sensation of airflow without alteration of nasal airway resistance. Our results suggested that the nasal sensation of airflow could not reflect real patency completely. Therefore, assessment of subjective sensation of airflow and measurement of nasal airway resistance combined must be used in the diagnosis and treatment of nasally obstructed patients.
