The role of catalase in hydrogen peroxide resistance in Schizosaccharomyces pombe was investigated. A catalase gene disruptant completely lacking catalase activity is more sensitive to hydrogen peroxide than the parent strain. The mutant does not acquire hydrogen peroxide resistance by osmotic stress, a treatment that induces catalase activity in the wild-type cells. The growth rate of the disruptant is not different from that of the parent strain. Additionally, transformed cells that overexpress the catalase activity are more resistant to hydrogen peroxide than wildtype cells with normal catalase activity. These results indicate that the catalase of S. pombe plays an important role in resistance to high concentrations of hydrogen peroxide but offers little in the way of protection from the hydrogen peroxide generated in small amounts under normal growth conditions.
