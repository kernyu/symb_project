Increased and inappropriate use of vancomycin during the past 35 years has led to the development of vancomycin-resistant enterococcal (VRE) species that are difficult and expensive to treat. This article presents case reviews of patients who experienced vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (VREF) infections during prolonged hospitalizations after transplantation. The risk factors for the development of VRE infection, prevention measures, and the interventions to be implemented once VRE infection is diagnosed are discussed.
