The in vitro activities of 16 antimicrobial agents against 180 Acinetobacter strains isolated from blood cultures (n = 162), central venous catheters (n = 11), and cerebrospinal fluids (n = 7) were studied. MICs were determined by a microtiter broth dilution method. Considerable differences in antimicrobial drug susceptibility against strains belonging to different species could be demonstrated. Acinetobacter baumannii isolates (n = 108) were generally more resistant than isolates identified as species other than A. baumannii. Multidrug resistance was common among A. baumannii isolates. Of the antimicrobial agents tested, imipenem was highly active against all A. baumannii isolates, and the other agents tested were only moderately active or inactive. Good activity against Acinetobacter species strain 3 was demonstrated for imipenem, amikacin, and ciprofloxacin. Most of the strains belonging to other species were susceptible to imipenem, ciprofloxacin, expanded-spectrum cephalosporins, amoxicillin-clavulanate, and the aminoglycosides but were resistant to ampicillin and older cephalosporins.
