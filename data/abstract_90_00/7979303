The agar dilution method was used to determine the activities of gentamicin, erythromycin, streptomycin, chloramphenicol, ampicillin, sulfamethazine, cephalothin, penicillin G, and tetracycline against 73 strains belonging to the genus Listeria (L. innocua, L. seeligeri, and L. monocytogenes). All strains were isolated from raw milk, cheese, the dairy processing plant, poultry, and the poultry slaughterhouse. Gentamicin, ampicillin, and erythromycin, of which the MICs for 90% of the strains tested for all three species were < or = 5.96 micrograms/ml, were found to be the most active agents studied. Most of the L. innocua strains isolated from poultry and the poultry slaughterhouse were resistant to tetracycline.
