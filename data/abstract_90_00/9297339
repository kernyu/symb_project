HIV strains isolated from HIV patients hospitalized at the Central Research Institute of Epidemiology in 1991-1993 are analyzed. HIV-1 strains isolated at different stages of the illness were referred to subtypes A and B. The biological properties of the isolates of both subtypes were virtually the same. The majority of the isolated HIV-1 strains were relatively resistant to azidothymidin, no matter whether the patients were previously treated with this drug or not. Study of strains repeatedly isolated from the same patients showed an increase of the cytodestructive characteristics of the isolates. Strains isolated from the same epidemiological chain were characterized by the same properties and sensitivity to the tested antiHIV agents. The resistance of the virus to antiHIV drugs with different mechanisms of action may be an indicator of the terminal stage of the illness.
