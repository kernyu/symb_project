We report two cases of penicillin G-resistant pneumococcal meningitis in adults, with clinical and bacteriological failure of amoxicillin and negative or incomplete response to third generation cephalosporins. Meningitis occurred in a man treated for myeloma and in an elderly woman under prolonged intermittent amoxicillin therapy for chronic otitis. Such situations are known as exposing to pneumococcal meningitis and to resistance of the strain involved to penicillin G. Both patients were cured by vancomycin in continuous infusion associated with rifampicin or fosfomycin. Contrary to third generation cephalosporins, which have higher minimal inhibitory concentrations, vancomycin and rifampicin are still fully active against penicillin G-resistant pneumococcal strains. Thus, vancomycin administered in continuous infusion and associated with rifampicin and fosfomycin deserves to be tried as first-line treatment of pneumococcal meningitis in patients at risk of resistance to penicillin G.
