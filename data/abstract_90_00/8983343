The chemosensitizing effect of Pluronic P85 block copolymer were studied using two human ovarian carcinoma sublines: the glycoprotein P (P-gp) multidrug resistant (MDR) SKVLB cells and non-MDR SKOV3 cells. The dramatic increase (up to 700 times) in the daunorubicin cytotoxic activity was observed in the presence of 0.01% (22 microM) to 1% (2.2 mM) copolymer in the case of SKVLB cells. By contrast, the copolymer induced a less than 3-fold increase in the drug activity in SKOV3 cells. As a result, the MDR subline demonstrated much higher response ("hypersensitivity") to the daunorubicin/ Pluronic compared to that of the non-MDR cells. The copolymer increased the cytotoxic effects of other MDR type drugs (doxorubicin, epirubicin, vinblastine, and mitomycin C) by a factor of 20-1000 and non-MDR type drugs (methotrexate and cisplatin) by a factor of 2-5.5. The daunorubicin influx in the cytoplasm and nuclei of SKVLB cells was also increased in the presence of the copolymer, while in SKOV3 cells, it remained practically unchanged. However, the hypersensitization of the MDR cells by the copolymer could not be merely explained by the P-gp modulation. Therefore, the possible role of the copolymer in inhibition of non-P-gp drug resistance is hypothesized, which may also explain the sensitization of MDR cells with respect to non-MDR type drugs as well as sensitization of parental cells. The concentration dependence of the IC50 in MDR cells indicates that just the copolymer unimers are responsible for the hypersensitization effect. The results obtained suggest that Pluronic P85 can be used as a delivery system to enhance the activity of antineoplastic agents against MDR tumors.
