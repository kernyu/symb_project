In this work we determined the hydrocarbon , sterol and triterpenoid composition of two plants used as antibacterial drug in traditional peruvian medicine, Berberis rariflora and Chenopodium multifidum. In both plants the presence of unsaturated hydrocarbons is very low, whereas the presence of odd hydrocarbons is considerable. The delta 7 sterols are more abundant than delta 5 sterols. We found also a great presence of stigmasterol derivatives in both plants, whereas lanosterol derivates are more abundant in B. rariflora. The microbiological tests shows for both plants an evident antibacterial activity against Gram(+) bacteria.
