One hundred twelve Shigella flexneri strain isolated from children with diarrheal disease in Somalia in 1983, 1984, 1988, and 1989 were analyzed for serotype, plasmid profile, and genetic location of antimicrobial resistance determinants. The prevalent serotypes were 4 (46% of the isolates), 1b (16%), 2a (16%), 3a (12%), and 6 (8%). Each serotype was associated with a characteristic predominant plasmid profile, whereas no specific correlation between antimicrobial resistance patterns and single serotypes was found. All but three of the strains were resistant at least to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, spectinomycin, and tetracycline. Of these resistant strains, 41 were resistant to sulfonamide and streptomycin and 14 were resistant to trimethoprim or trimethoprim and kanamycin. The genes for resistance to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, spectinomycin, and tetracycline formed a linkage group located on the chromosome of the strains of all serotypes. The genes for resistance to sulfonamide and streptomycin were located on a 6.3-kb plasmid in strains of serotypes 1b, 2a, and 4. Conjugative trimethoprim or trimethoprim and kanamycin resistance plasmids with lengths of 80 to 110 kb were present in strains of serotypes 1b, 2a, 3a, and 4. The systematic presence of a chromosomal component in this uncommon genetic plasmid-chromosome configuration may play a role in the emergence of increased genetic stability of resistance patterns in S. flexneri.
