In an open clinical trial, thirty patients 14 to 44 years old and with acute uncomplicated falciparum malaria were given halofantrine hydrochloride 500 mg (2 tablets) 6-hourly for 3 doses, a total dose of 1500 mg. All 30 patients were cured, with a mean asexual parasite clearance time of 47.6 hours and mean fever clearance time of 36.6 hours. Post-dosing side-effects occurred in 6 patients consisting of mild to moderate headache, dizziness and abdominal muscle spasm. Drug-induced hemolysis did not occur in two G6PD deficient patients. Twenty-three out of 28 isolates tested (82%) were resistant to amodiaquine, 3 (11%) were resistant to the sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine combination, and all were sensitive to chloroquine, quinine and mefloquine by in vitro microtests. The study confirms the efficacy of halofantrine hydrochloride as a blood schizonticide in falciparum malaria.
