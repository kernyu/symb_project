Staphylococcus aureus is the pathogen most often isolated from blood during bacteraemic episodes in haemodialysis patients (42%). The pathophysiology of these infections is discussed and a prophylactic strategy is proposed. Nasal carriage of S. aureus, found in 42% of haemodialysis patients, plays a major role in its cutaneous dissemination and hence in the risk of infection by this microorganism. Long-term use of nasal mupirocin in haemodialysis patients with nasal carriage of S. aureus (t.i.d. for 3 to 5 days, followed by once a week) led to a decrease in the yearly incidence of S. aureus bacteraemia from 0.097 to 0.024 (p < 0.01). Tolerance was excellent. This chemoprophylaxis results in substantial savings. When applied as proposed (only nasal application), the long-term use of mupirocin only very rarely leads to the emergence of mupirocin-resistance in S. aureus (1 case in 165 patient-years).
