The emergence of drug-resistant human immunodeficiency virus type 1 is a frequent cause of failure of combination therapies comprising reverse transcriptase and protease inhibitors. Rational design of salvage therapies requires new methods to assess drug susceptibility. A novel phenotypic drug susceptibility assay was developed and used to measure the drug susceptibilities of viruses obtained from 2 patients treated with zidovudine, lamivudine, and nelfinavir. Results showed that phenotypic drug resistance may be detectable before virus load rebound, treatment failure does not always imply viral resistance to all drugs in a treatment regimen, and persons with similar antiviral treatment histories and clinical courses may have different phenotypic drug resistance profiles at the time that treatment fails.
