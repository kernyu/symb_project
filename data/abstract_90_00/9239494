An outbreak of coagulase VII-producing, arbekacin (ABK)-resistant, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) occurred between September 1994 and December 1995, involving five different wards. Twenty-one patients developed skin, wound, drainage, or respiratory tract colonization with coagulase VII-producing, (ABK)-resistant MRSA. Phenotypic characteristics (production of enterotoxin and TSST-1, antimicrobial susceptibility) and molecular-typing procedure (plasmid DNA profile, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis [PFGE] and arbitrarily primed polymerase chain reaction [AP-PCR] of chromosomal DNA) in isolated strains were compared. Plasmid analysis identified four different profiles and 19 of 22 strains recovered had identical patterns. PFGE of chromosomal DNA identified three different subtypes and 18 (81.8%) isolates shared the same subtype. AP-PCR also demonstrated that most strains had the same phenotypic characteristics. Although traditional epidemiological methods; for example, coagulase typing, plays a central role in hospital infection control, combination of plasmid DNA profile, AP-PCR, and PFGE may prove to be a particularly informative means of tracking the nosocomial spread of MRSA.
