The infectious agent of swine dysentery, Brachyspira (Br.) hyodysenteriae, seems to be widespread in German pig herds. Due to different reasons the eradication is increasingly difficult. Not only the success of therapeutic procedures but also the possibilities of diagnostics are unsatisfactory. Although only the bacteriological investigation of faeces or intestinal probes by culture techniques allows the typing of Brachyspira strains and the testing of drug resistance, however, the rate of false negative results is relatively high. In comparison with the cultural method an easy, prompt and cheap immunofluorescent test (IFT) resulted in a good sensitivity (90%). The higher rate of negative results by culture techniques can not be attributed to a lower specificity of the IFT, but to an insufficient transport of samples to the laboratory. The IFT therefore has to be considered as a valuable supplement to the cultural diagnostic of Br. hyodysenteriae. It is absolutely necessary to establish strategies in eradication of swine dysentery which result in pig breeding herds free of Br. hyodysenteriae. Only weaner pigs which are reliable free of this germ guarantee a fattening period sufficiently free of swine dysentery. The principles of different measures in effective eradication are described.
