Several new antitumor agents belonging to the class of minor groove binders that are able to form covalent bonds with DNA via a cyclopropylpyrroloindole (CPI) group are susceptible to a multidrug resistance (MDR) phenotype in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. The multidrug resistant CCHR-C5 cell line was 16-, 23- and 13-fold more resistant to the analogs U-73,975, U-77,779 and U-80,244, respectively, although its cytotoxic response to the parent compound CC-1065 was similar to the response of the drug-sensitive wild-type cells (AuxB1). For a sequence of MDR cell lines showing increasing expression of P-glycoprotein (Pgp) there were corresponding increments in the level of resistance to U-73,975, arguing that Pgp is the key determinant in resistance of the MDR cells to CPI agents. MDR cells treated with U-73,975 showed diminished generation of covalent adducts on DNA as well as increased resistance to cytotoxicity.
