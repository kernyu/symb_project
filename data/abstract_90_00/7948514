Mucor circinelloides form circinelloides has rarely been associated with human disease, even in immunocompromised patients. We report a case of cutaneous zygomycosis caused by M. circinelloides in a 23-year-old neutropenic woman receiving consolidation chemotherapy for acute myelogenous leukemia. The organism was exquisitely susceptible to amphotericin B. Despite the fact that the patient was profoundly neutropenic for an additional 3 weeks, the lesions began to resolve during therapy, and no surgical debridement was required.
