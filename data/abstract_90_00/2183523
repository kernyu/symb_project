K2 neutral strain Saccharomyces cerevisiae USM12 was identified and characterized. This strain carried an M double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) genome encoding for resistance to K2 toxin. The M dsRNA was larger than the K2 killer yeast M dsRNA and homoduplex analysis of denatured and reannealed K2 neurtal M dsRNA revealed an inverted duplication. Heteroduplex analysis showed that two thirds of the K2 M genome had homology with the K2 neutral M genome. Hybridization showed that the USM12 M dsRNA had significant homology with the K2 M dsRNA. Protein profiles of extracellular proteins from USM12 and a cured strain indicated that USM12 did not secrete any toxin. This is the first time that a K2 neutral yeast strain has been characterized.
