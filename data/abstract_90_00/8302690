Infection due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis continues to plague humanity. In the United States, conditions have taken a decided turn for the worse, with an increasing frequency of infection and the spread of multiple-drug-resistant strains. A number of strategies are available to improve the management of this epidemic. Mycobacterium avium is now recognized as a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. Therapy is limited due to relative drug resistance, drug intolerance, and drug malabsorption; however, potentially useful regimens are being developed.
