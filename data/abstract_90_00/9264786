The aim of our work is to explore the use of IFN-beta for gene therapy in the HIV-infection. Transduction of various HIV target cells with a retroviral vector that carries the Hu-IFN-beta coding sequence under constitutive low expression control, confers resistance to HIV without affecting cell replication or function. After transduction, lymphocytes from HIV-infected patients develop resistance to the endogenous virus, provided the cells are derived from individuals with a CD4 cell count higher than 200 per mm3.
