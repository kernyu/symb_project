A total of 263 Salmonella strains isolated in Metro Manila, the Philippines from 1992 to 1994, were examined for their serovar-distribution and drug-resistance. Salmonella serovar Typhi (S. Typhi) and S. Enteritidis phage type was also tested. The serological typing results showed that the strains were classified into 10 O-groups and 32 serovars. S. Weltevreden, S. Enteritidis, S. Typhi, S. Typhimurium, and S. Derby were predominant in the serovars identified. The drug-resistance test using nine drugs (CP, TC, SM, KM, ABPC, ST, NA, FOM, and NFLX) showed that 95 strains (36.1%) were resistant to any of the seven drugs except FOM and NFLX. The serovars of a high resistant rate were S. Ruiru (100%), S. Typhimurium (87.0%), S. Senftenberg (80.0%), S. Derby (66.7%), and S. Agona (50.0%). Drug-resistance patterns of the resistant strains varied to 21 types, and 80 of them were multidrug-resistant. Phage types of 37 S. Typhi strains were B1 (27 strains), E2 (6 strains), and others (4 strains). Phage types of 38 S. Enteritidis strains were 4 (32 strains), 7 (3 strains), and others (3 strains).
