The in vitro susceptibilities of 22 isolates of Edwardsiella tarda were studied with 22 antibiotics and antibiotic-beta-lactamase-inhibitor agents. Results indicated that all isolates were susceptible to the aminoglycosides, cephalosporins, penicillins, imipenem, aztreonam, ciprofloxacin, and antibiotic-beta-lactamase-inhibitor agents. Each strain produced a beta-lactamase even though no resistance was detected to the beta-lactams.
