The growth of MethA tumor was significantly inhibited by oral administration of the alpha-glucan SPR-901 in BALB/c (+/+) mice but not in nude mice. Mice treated orally with SPR-901 exhibited an augmentation of antigen-specific resistance against rechallenge with the tumor cells. The tumor-neutralizing activity of regional lymph node cells from MethA-bearing mice against the tumor was augmented by oral administration of SPR-901. The tumor-neutralizing activity of lymph node cells from SPR-901-treated mice mainly appeared in Lyt2+ cells. Furthermore, lymphokine-activated killer activity of these cells was enhanced by administration of SPR-901. The antitumor effect of SPR-901 was abrogated in mice depleted of either L3T4+ or Lyt2+ cells, and in cyclosporin-A-treated mice. These results suggest that Lyt2+ cells are important effector cells in MethA-bearing mice orally administered SPR-901 and that functional exertion of both Lyt2+ and L3T4+ T cells is necessary for the antitumor effect of orally administered SPR-901 in vivo.
