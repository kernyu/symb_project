To further study the relationship between resistance to apoptosis and drug resistance in harringtonine-resistant HL-60 cells (HR20), cyclosporine A (CsA) 20, 10 micrograms.ml-1 was shown to induce the sensitive HL-60 cells to apoptosis, showing a typical DNA "ladder" band. But the same concentrations of CsA retarded the HR20 cells in G1 phase and could not induce the cells to apoptosis. The cellular daunorubicin accumulation increased when HR20 cells were treated with low concentration of CsA and the reversal of drug resistance by CsA was unrelated to the retardation of cell cycle progression. High phosphorylation of about 50 kDa protein occured when HR20 cells were treated with CsA 10 micrograms.ml-1. The results domonstrate that cyclosporine A retarded the harringtonine-resistant HL-60 cells in G1 phase but induced HL-60 cells to apoptosis, and the retardation was unrelated to drug resistance.
