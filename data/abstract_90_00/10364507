SVMPA is a mutant of Sindbis virus, selected for its ability to replicate in mycophenolic acid (MPA)-treated mosquito cells. SVMPA has another phenotype: although able to replicate normally in primary cultures of chick embryo fibroblasts (CEF), its replication is restricted in secondary cultures prepared from aged primary CEF cultures. The mutations responsible for these phenotypes mapped to the region of the viral genome that codes for nsP1. We report here that SVMPA has yet another phenotype. Relative to our standard Sindbis virus (SVSTD) from which it was derived, SVMPA shows an increased sensitivity to chick interferon, both crude interferon prepared from virus-infected cells and recombinant interferon. Characterization of viral mutants obtained after site-directed mutagenesis indicated that the same mutations responsible for the host restriction of SVMPA in secondary cultures of CEF were also responsible for its increased sensitivity to chick interferon.
