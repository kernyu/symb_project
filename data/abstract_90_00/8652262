Dipyridamole is known as a potent inhibitor of facilitated diffusion-mediated nucleoside transport as well as a modulator of 'classical' multidrug resistance. BIBW22BS, a derivative of dipyridamole, has been found to be 20- to 100-fold more potent in the reversal of multidrug resistance when compared to the parent compound. In parallel, we studied the efficacy of BIBW22BS in the modulation of the antiproliferative effects of 5-fluorouracil, methotrexate and gemcitabine in human cancer cell lines. BIBW22BS, at non-toxic concentrations up to 1.0 microM, increased the antiproliferative effects of 5-fluorouracil 2- to 6-fold in seven of the eight colon cancer cell lines tested in a dose-dependent manner. The addition of 1.0 microM BIBW22BS to methotrexate resulted in a slight increase in the antiproliferative effects, but inhibited the activity of gemcitabine 30- to 100-fold in various cancer cell lines. In vitro, no notable difference was found between BIBW22BS and dipyridamole in their capacity to modulate the activity of the antimetabolites studied. BIBW22BS did not affect the growth inhibition induced by 5-fluorouracil or gemcitabine in human tumour xenografts grown subcutaneously in nude mice. We confirmed the higher potency of BIBW22BS when compared to dipyridamole in the reversal of drug resistance in the Pgp-positive COLO 320 cell line.
