Susceptibility of 66 and 62 Australian isolates of Salmonella enteritidis to nitrofurantoin and furazolidone, respectively, was determined. Most isolates were susceptible to both antibiotics. Cross-resistance was low among all isolates, but higher among the subset of phage type 4 isolates. These results contrast directly with those of a previous study (Rampling, A., Upson, R. and Brown, D.F.J. (1990) J. Antimicrob. Chemother., 25: 285-290). Sensitivity among Australian isolates of S. enteritidis does to some extent, support the contention that furans may have played a role in the selection and enhanced colonisation of poultry by Salmonella enteritidis in Britain. Furthermore, nitrofurantoin should not be used as a selective agent in the isolation of Salmonella enteritidis.
