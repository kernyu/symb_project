A series of cephalosporin derivatives with various bicyclic heterocycles at the C-3 position was synthesized and evaluated for antibacterial activity. Among them CP0467 (3a) showed excellent antibacterial activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (MIC90 = 6.25 microg/mL), and extremely high affinity for the penicillin binding protein 2' of MRSA (I50 = 0.49 microg/mL). Furthermore, 3a showed a long-acting pharmacokinetic profile in mice (AUC(infinity) = 482.3 microg/h/mL and T(1/2) = 1.9 h).
