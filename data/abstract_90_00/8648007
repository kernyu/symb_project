We report a 48-year-old woman who developed necrotizing groin fasciitis with insidious onset. Before she visited us, she had been unsuccessfully treated with several kinds of antibiotics by other doctors for one month, because of a small ulcer covered by blackish necrotic tissue. She was referred to us because of high fever, an ulcer on the left labium majus, and a cellulitis-like lesion with severe pain on the lower abdomen. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Streptococcus intermedius, and Bacteroides uniformis were isolated from the wound. After aggressive debridement on the eighth day after admission of the whole indurated area and the fascia of the underlying muscle, healthy granulation tissue covered the defect, and the wound was finally closed with a skin graft Long-term administration of antibiotics along with insufficient and delayed surgical treatment were considered to have caused the full development of this disease.
