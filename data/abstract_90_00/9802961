The effects of i.v. injections of two endogenous tachykinins, substance P (SP) and neuropeptide gamma and the highly selective tachykinin agonists [Sar9,Met(O2)11]-SP, [Lys5,MeLeu9, Nle10]-NKA(4-10) and senktide, on total lung resistance (RL), dynamic lung compliance (Cdyn) and systemic blood pressure, were compared in the anaesthetized rabbit. Senktide, the NK-3 receptor selective agonist, had no effect on RL, Cdyn or blood pressure. The other four agonists caused dose-dependent increases in RL and Cdyn, with [Sar9,Met(O2)11]-SP being the most potent agonist in producing changes in the absence of phosphoramidon. This suggested that NK-1 receptors play an important role in these responses. [Sar9, Met(O2)11]-SP, SP and neuropeptide gamma also decreased blood pressure. Phosphoramidon (1 mg/kg) potentiated the changes in RL and Cdyn evoked by [Sar9,Met(O2)11]-SP and SP, with very marked enhancement of responses to neuropeptide gamma. Responses to [Lys5, MeLeu9,Nle10]-NKA(4-10) were unaffected, suggesting that this NK-2 selective agonist may not be catabolized by neutral endopeptidase (NEP). In the presence of phosphoramidon, the non-peptide tachykinin NK-1 receptor selective antagonist CP 96345 (80 nmol/kg) reduced all responses to [Sar9,Met(O2)11]-SP and SP, whereas the NK-2 selective antagonist SR 48968 (40 nmol/kg) inhibited the bronchomotor but not the vasodepressor responses to neuropeptide gamma and [Lys5,MeLeu9, Nle10]-NKA(4-10). The fall in blood pressure induced by neuropeptide gamma was diminished by CP 96345, whereas bronchoconstriction was unaffected, indicating possible differences in NK-1 receptors in the vasculature and airways. Electrical stimulation of the distal ends of vagus nerves caused increases in RL which were abolished by atropine (1 mg/kg).
