Experiments were conducted with a clone of Trypanosoma congolense, IL 3580, which exhibited a low level of resistance to isometamidium chloride. Five cattle were treated intramuscularly with isometamidium chloride at a dose rate of 0.5 mg kg-1 body weight (BW) and challenged 28 days later with 5 Glossina morsitans centralis infected with T. congolense IL 3580. All 5 cattle and 15 untreated steers challenged on the same day became parasitaemic by day 15 post-infection. Thus, at a dose of 0.5 mg kg-1 BW, the prophylactic action of isometamidium chloride did not extend to 28 days following treatment. Subsequently, the 20 steers were divided into 4 groups of 5 animals each and treated with isometamidium chloride at one of the following dose rates; 0.5 or 1.0 mg kg-1 BW intramuscularly and 0.5 or 1.0 mg kg-1 BW intravenously (Groups A, B, C and D, respectively). Group A consisted of the 5 animals that had previously been treated with isometamidium chloride. Animals relapsed in all groups except those in Group B, treated intramuscularly with isometamidium chloride at a dose of 1.0 mg kg-1 BW. Four of the 5 animals in Group A, treated intramuscularly with isometamidium chloride at a dose of 0.5 mg kg-1 BW relapsed following a mean interval of 16 days post-treatment. Similarly, infections in all animals in Groups C and D, given intravenous injections of isometamidium chloride at a dose of 0.5 and 1.0 mg kg-1 BW, respectively, were not eliminated as a result of treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
