Changes in antibiotic susceptibility was evaluated in 77 consecutive nosocomial clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus collected from 1986 to 1994 at the Umberto I Polyclinic of the University of Rome (63 isolates) and from 7 other Roman hospitals (14 isolates). Oxacillin resistance in these isolates increased from 39% during the 1980s to 69% during the 1990s. Significant increases in resistance to ciprofloxacin, clindamycin and rifampicin were observed among oxacillin-resistant strains. No resistance to glycopeptides was observed although both teicoplanin and vancomycin had slightly reduced antistaphylococcal activity.
