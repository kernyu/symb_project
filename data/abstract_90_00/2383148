Sensitivity of the main microbial species causing gas gangrene to 21 antibacterial drugs was studied. The pathogens included 28 strains of Clostridium perfringens, 21 strains of C. oedematiens, 31 strains of C. septicum and 19 strains of C. histolyticum. Antibiotics having a bactericidal effect on the Clostridia were determined. The findings of the study were indicative of a variety of the antibiotic sensitivity spectra of the Clostridium spp., which accentuated the importance of antibiotic sensitivity assay in every particular case of gas gangrene.
