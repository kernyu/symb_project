SETTING: The highest priority for tuberculosis (TB) control is to ensure patients complete therapy. However, standardized, detailed evaluation of national performance on completion of therapy in the United States has been lacking. Since 1982, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has had a program objective that at least 90% of TB cases complete therapy. Since 1986, the standard of practice for patients with drug-susceptible TB has been 6 months of therapy. OBJECTIVE: To determine completion of therapy rates and duration of therapy for US TB patients reported in 1993. DESIGN: Expanded TB surveillance data on all US TB patients reported to the CDC in 1993 with initial therapy of two or more drugs were analyzed with respect to completion and duration of therapy. RESULTS: A disposition (reason therapy stopped) was obtained on 98.7% of 23 489 treated patients. Overall, 91.2% of evaluable patients completed therapy. The overall completion rate at 12 months of therapy was 66.8%, and 90% completion was reached at 23 months. For patients with initially drug-susceptible TB, completion was 7.1% at 6 months, 66.5% at 12 months, and reached 90% at 22 months. CONCLUSION: While completion rates ultimately exceeded 90% nationwide, there was considerable delay in reaching this objective, especially in patients with drug-susceptible TB. It is critical that health departments and health care providers identify and remedy any deficiencies responsible for prolonged therapy.
