Invisible microbes play very important roles in all ecosystems. Living generally in harsh and seemingly inhospitable places all around, they reveal a remarkable potential and resilience of life. In all microbial ecosystems, antimicrobial substances, as antibiotics, are of crucial regulatory importance. In modern human and veterinarian medicine, about 50 million kilos of potent antibiotics are used every year. Some of these substances are very persistent in the ecosystem, i.e. they remain in the natural environment for a very long time. Now the microbial empire is striking back, and increasing resistance towards antibiotics is becoming a global problem. The need for a proper future strategy is underlined.
