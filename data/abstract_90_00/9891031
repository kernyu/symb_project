Many cell-free hemoglobin solutions designed as oxygen-carrying therapeutics produce a hypertensive effect in animals. The response is likely due to oxidation of nitric oxide by hemoglobin. Since the site of oxidation may lie outside the vascular compartment, we tested the hypothesis that polymerization of hemoglobin, rHb1.1, by glutaraldehyde would attenuate the hypertensive response. Two products of the cross-linking reaction were isolated, a glutaraldehyde-derivatized monomer (mono-glxrHb) and a glutaraldehyde cross-linked polymer (poly-glxrHb), and evaluated for their effects on systemic hemodynamics in conscious rats. Administration of rHb1.1 caused a mean arterial pressure elevation of approximately 20 mm Hg and an increase in total peripheral resistance of approximately 30%. Administration of mono-glxrHb induced changes in mean arterial pressure and vascular resistance that were significantly diminished relative to those observed with rHb1.1. Poly-glxrHb elicited a mean arterial pressure response that was further reduced compared with that obtained with mono-glxrHb and a change in vascular resistance that was the same as the response to mono-glxrHb. These results suggest that rHb peripheral vasoconstriction elicited by rHb1.1 is significantly attenuated by glutaraldehyde modification of the hemoglobin monomer and that the effect of glutaraldehyde polymerization is likely due to surface modification and/or intramolecular cross-linking, rather than an increase in molecular size.
