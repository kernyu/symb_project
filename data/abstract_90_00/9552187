A case-control study was performed in central New Jersey hospitals to evaluate the potential patient factors associated with the acquisition of amikacin-resistant gram-negative bacilli (ARGNB). Univariate analysis revealed an association between numerous patient factors, and multivariate analysis revealed four factors to be associated independently with ARGNB: the number of hospital admissions during the prior year, previous aminoglycoside exposure, intubation, and intensive-care-unit admission.
