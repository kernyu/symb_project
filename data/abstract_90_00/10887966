We have isolated a cDNA coding for beta-COP from Dictyostelium discoideum by polymerase chain reaction using degenerate primers derived from rat beta-COP. The complete cDNA clone has a size of 2.8 kb and codes for a protein with a calculated molecular mass of 102 kDa. Dictyostelium beta-COP exhibits highest homology to mammalian beta-COP, but it is considerably smaller due to a shortened variable region that is thought to form a linker between the highly conserved N- and C-terminal domains. Dictyostelium beta-COP is encoded by a single gene, which is transcribed at moderate levels into two RNAs that are present throughout development. To localize the protein, full-length beta-COP was fused to GFP and expressed in Dictyostelium cells. The fusion protein was detected on vesicles distributed all over the cells and was strongly enriched in the perinuclear region. Based on coimmunofluorescence studies with antibodies directed against the Golgi marker comitin, this compartment was identified as the Golgi apparatus. Beta-COP distribution in Dictyostelium was not brefeldin A sensitive being most likely due to the presence of a brefeldin A resistance gene. However, upon DMSO treatment we observed a reversible disassembly of the Golgi apparatus. In mammalian cells DMSO treatment had a similar effect on beta-COP distribution.
