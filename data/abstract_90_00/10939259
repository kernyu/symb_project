Salicylic acid (SA) is a key defense molecule in higher plants that is required for resistance to diverse pathogens. A number of mutants of Arabidopsis with elevated resistance to pathogens and constitutive activation of defense-related genes and cell death have been shown to require SA for all of their phenotypes. These mutants potentially identify interesting regulatory genes that control diverse SA responses. When dominant mutations confer SA-dependent phenotypes, it is important to know the genetic basis of dominance in order to draw conclusions on the possible mechanisms of action of the genes identified. Here I characterize the basis of the dominant phenotypes conferred by the ssi1 and lsd6 mutations. I show that ssi1 is haploinsufficient, while lsd6 is a gain-of-function mutation. Thus, SA-dependent responses are under both negative and positive regulation.
