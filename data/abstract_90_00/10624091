Epidemiological and microbiological studies were carried out using 200 strains of pneumococci isolated from clinical specimens in 5 Kitakyushu municipal hospitals, between October 1994 and July 1995. Eighty nine percent of pneumococci were detected in the specimens from the respiratory tract. Pneumococci were isolated mainly from infants under 3-years of age and adults over 50-years of age, and the rates of isolation were 40.5% and 39.5%, respectively. MICs of 8 antimicrobial agents, such as PCG, NFLX, CPFX, LFLX, FLRX, TFLX, SPFX, LVFX, were determined using broth microdilution methods. According to NCCLS standard (1997), recovery rates of PSSP, PISP and PRSP were 48.0%, 39.5% and 12.5%, respectively. Among 7 quinolones, TFLX, SPFX and LVFX were effective so far examined, except for a few resistant strains. Four cases in which quinolones resistant pneumococci were isolated were reviewed retrospectively. Among them 3 cases had been given quinolones before the strains were detected.
