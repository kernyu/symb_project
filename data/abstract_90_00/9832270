In a study designed to obtain data on compounds active against enterococci, the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of quinupristin/dalfopristin (RP 59500) and the novel quinolones DU-6859a, trovafloxacin, levofloxacin, and sparfloxacin were determined for 122 Enterococcus faecalis and seven Enterococcus faecium isolates. In addition, 15 Enterococcus faecalis isolates resistant to gentamicin, DU-6859a, and trovafloxacin were exposed over time to combinations of DU-6859a plus gentamicin and trovafloxacin plus gentamicin. DU-6859a and trovafloxacin were found to be the most active compounds against Enterococcus faecalis and DU-6859a and RP 59500 against Enterococcus faecium. Synergy between either DU-6859a or trovafloxacin and gentamicin was observed with 27 to 35% of the isolates. It is concluded that DU-6859a and trovafloxacin are very potent against enterococci, especially when combined with gentamicin.
