The pharmacodynamics of once-daily amikacin administered as monotherapy and in combination with aztreonam, ceftazidime, and cefepime against Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 and clinical isolate 16690 (moderately susceptible to ceftazidime) were investigated with an in vitro model of infection over a 24-h period. Monotherapy with aztreonam, ceftazidime, and cefepime and combinations of aztreonam with cefepime or ceftazidime were also studied. MICs and MBCs were determined for viable organisms at 24 h to test for the development of resistance. Once-daily amikacin demonstrated killing activity over the initial 8 h superior to those of all other drugs administered as monotherapy against both strains tested (P < 0.01). Regrowth by 24 h was greatest for the amikacin regimen (P < 0.01) but was apparent for all monotherapy regimens against both strains. No changes in susceptibilities were observed. All combination therapies containing once-daily amikacin achieved 99.9% reductions in log10 CFU/ml by 2.0 h against both strains, with no regrowth of organisms at 24 h. Aztreonam-cefepime and -ceftazidime combinations required approximately 5 to 6 h to achieve a 99.9% reduction in log10 CFU/ml. Although there was no difference in time to the 99.9% kill between the aztreonam-cefepime and -ceftazidime regimens against either strain, the killing activity of these combinations was significantly less than those of regimens containing once-daily amikacin (P < 0.01). Minor differences in the initial susceptibilities of beta-lactams and the monobactam aztreonam against P. aeruginosa may not be important for therapeutic outcomes when used in combination with single-daily aminoglycoside therapy.
