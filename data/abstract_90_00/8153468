In our study, out of 449 Enterobacteriaceae strains isolated between 1985 and 1990, 16 strains (3 Proteus, 6 nontyphoidal Salmonella, 7 Escherichia coli) were resistant both to Ampicillin- Sulbactam and Amoxycillin-Clavulanic acid associations. The activity profiles of the beta-lactamases produced by these resistant strains are described. Sarcina lutea ATCC 9341 was used as test strain. The effect of the enzymatic filtrate against beta-lactam antibiotics: Ampicillin, Cloxacillin, Cefadroxil, Cefuroxime, Cefotaxime, Ceftriaxone, was followed up. The enzyme types were established according to the ability of inactivating the tested antibiotics. Penicillins and cephalosporins were inactivated by these enzymes, except for Carbenicillin and Oxacillin. These beta-lactamases were resistant to Sulbactam and Clavulanic acid. In the studied Salmonella strains they are plasmidic codified, demonstrating that they belong to a new beta-lactamase class.
