Obligately thermophilic strains of Bacillus stearothermophilus were screened for the presence of plasmids by agarose gel electrophoresis. All strains in our collection contained large plasmids (20 x 10(6)-80 x 10(6)) and were divided into four groups with respect to their plasmid pattern and production of bacteriocins. The major plasmid species were designated pSE407 (38.7 x 10(6)), pSE409 (29.0 x 10(6)), pSE411 (21.5 x 10(6)), and pSE410 (23.5 x 10(6)). Their physical endonuclease maps were constructed, and by Southern blots and hybridizations it was shown that these plasmids were related. From curing experiments and electrotransformations (electroporations) we conclude that pSE407, pSE410, and pSE411 code for temperature resistance. In addition pSE410 codes for bacteriocin production and resistance. Plasmid pSE409 probably also codes for bacteriocin production and resistance.
