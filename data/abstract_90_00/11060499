Mutation L210W of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) is one of the six main mutations that confer in vivo resistance to zidovudine. Surprisingly, this mutation has received scant appraisal and its contribution to the genotypic resistance to nucleoside analogs is not well understood. The aim of this study was: (1) to study the frequency of mutation L210W in a large collection of HIV-1 sequences (2,049 samples, including 395 DNA and 1,654 RNA sequences) from patients receiving combination therapy, and (2) to analyze its association with the other mutations that confer resistance to zidovudine. A mutation at codon 210 (mainly L210W) was found in 647 (32%) of the 2,049 sequences analyzed. Only 43 (<7%) of these 647 genomes were also mutated at codon 70 (p < 10(-5)). In contrast, 98% of these 647 sequences were also mutated at codon 215 (essentially T215Y/F), and 94% at codon 41 (mainly M41L). These data showing a close association between L210W, T215Y/F, and M41L, and a mutual exclusion between K70R and L210W, were confirmed by analyzing the sequences stored in the HIV-1 sequences available through the Stanford HIV RT and Protease Database. Follow-up studies demonstrated that L210W appeared always after T215Y/F. This observation is consistent with crystallographic studies which suggested that the aromatic side chain of Trp 210 could stabilize the interaction of Phe/Tyr215 with the dNTP-binding pocket. This molecular cross-talk between amino acid chains occurs nearby the conserved Asp113 residue. Since the lateral chain of Arg70 may also interact with Asp113, this is likely to create a sterical hindrance around this residue. Thus, the R-->K reversion of codon 70 may represent a compensatory mechanism allowing a functional rearrangement of the dNTP-binding pocket in the mutated RT.
