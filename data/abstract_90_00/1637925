It has been found that high concentrations of exogenous hydrogen peroxide kill human neutrophils, the range of toxic concentrations being 100 times as high as that for human endothelial cells. Whereas the H2O2 doses of 30-100 mM induce a fast massive death of neutrophils, 10 mM hydrogen peroxide induces appreciable death only within several hours after treatment. H2O2 used at 30 mM decreases superoxide anion generation by neutrophils stimulated with PMA or FMLP. This decrease is commensurate in value with cell death, thus indicating a high functional resistance of survived cells. In the dose of 10 mM hydrogen peroxide potentiates FMLP (but not PMA-)-induced generation of superoxide anions. Augmentation of superoxide anion generation by H2O2-primed neutrophils in response to FMLP amounts to 200% of the control value. Hydrogen peroxide alone is incapable of inducing superoxide anion generation. It is concluded that exogenous oxidants can alter the functional activity of leukocytes freshly recruited in inflammatory and ischemic tissues.
