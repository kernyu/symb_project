Before 1983, S. hadar was seldom isolated from man, animals, food or the environment in Japan: only one strain having been isolated from man and one from the environment. In subsequent years there has been a progressive increase in the number of isolations. S. hadar is now one of the commonest serotypes isolated from cases of sporadic diarrhea in Shizuoka Prefecture (Table 1). However, the epidemiology of S. hadar is not clearly understood. Reports on the clinical features of S. hadar gastroenteritis are also scarce. We examined the clinical symptoms of 15 cases of S. hadar gastroenteritis. S. hadar was encountered in patients of all ages. Infants and young children below 10 years of age constituted 47% of all cases. Seventy per cent of young children below 10 years of age experienced fever of more than 39 degrees C. This incidence was significantly higher than that of general Salmonella gastroenteritis observed in our previous study, in which fever of more than 38 degrees C was noted in 61% of the children. We found one case of presumptive person-to-person spread. No other household contacts of index patients suffered from diarrhea during the same period. Systematic examination for Salmonella contamination was performed for poultry farms, broiler chickens, broiler processing plants and meat on the market. 259 Salmonella strains were isolated from 1197 samples. S. hadar accounted for 37.1% (96) of all isolations (259). A drug resistance test was performed for 51 strains of the diarrhea cases and 67 strains of the environment. The pattern of the distribution of MICs of 9 drugs was similar in the two groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
