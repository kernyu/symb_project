Four cases of postoperative meningitis caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) are reported together with a review of the literature. These 4 cases were treated successfully by intravenous administration of minomycin, fosfomycin, and cefmetazole. Factors associated with the development of meningitis included multiple craniotomies, the presence of ventricular drainage or a ventriculo-peritoneal shunt, and irradiation.
