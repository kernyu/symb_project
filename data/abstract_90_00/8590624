Alcohol abuse is associated with the loss of immunocompetence, which leads to decreasing resistance to infections. No single mechanism can be accountable for the detrimental effects of alcohol on the body's defense mechanism. We present data demonstrating that, in cultured lymphocytes, 10-40 mM alcohol in the media caused 18-90% decrease in cell mitosis (p < 0.001). There was a linear decrease in cell mitosis upto 40 mM alcohol; at 100 mM cell mitosis virtually ceased. This study aimed to determine in which phase of the cell cycle did alcohol mediate its effects. The results showed that DNA synthesis was not affected with up to 50 mM alcohol, suggesting that G1-S phase in the cell cycle remained unaffected. At 100 mM alcohol, DNA synthesis decreased significantly (p < 0.01). From the results of this study, we conclude that a subpharmacological dose level of alcohol (10 mM) significantly inhibited cell mitosis and the inhibitory effect of alcohol was mediated in the G2-M phase in the cell cycle. The G1-S phase was unaffected.
