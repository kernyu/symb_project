Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) readily immortalizes human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) in vitro. We found recently that PBL from two EBV-seropositive healthy adults were exceptionally resistant to immortalization by EBV. In contrast to PBL from other EBV-seropositive donors sensitive to immortalization by EBV (S-PBL), the "resistant" PBL (R-PBL) respond to EBV infection with an early interleukin-2 (IL-2) synthesis and high interferon gamma (IFN gamma) production. In order to determine whether these differences in cytokine responses between R-PBL and S-PBL could be associated with a detectable difference in lymphocyte cytotoxicity, we compared the natural killer (NK) activity of R-PBL and S-PBL effectors by using both NK-sensitive (i.e. K562) and NK-resistant (i.e. Raji) targets. We found that, while effectors from EBV-infected R-PBL and S-PBL cultures exhibited comparable NK activity against the K562 targets, they differed remarkably in their cytolytic activity against Raji cells. At days 3 and 5 of culture, effectors from EBV-infected R-PBL showed a significantly higher lytic activity against Raji targets, whereas S-PBL did not. Culture of EBV-infected R-PBL and S-PBL effectors in the presence of recombinant IL-2 (rIL-2) for 5 days resulted in increases of their lytic activity against Raji cells, whereas pretreatment of these effectors with recombinant IFN gamma (rIFN gamma) was found to increase only R-PBL cytotoxicity. These results suggest that the resistance of R-PBL to EBV immortalization could be associated with a lymphokine-mediated early cellular cytotoxic response of the NK/LAK (lymphokine-activated killer cell) type against EBV-infected cells.
