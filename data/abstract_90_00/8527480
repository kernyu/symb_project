We evaluated the ability of a replication-deficient, recombinant adenoviral vector to transfer the bifunctional gene GAL-TEK, which expresses a marking/therapeutic gene product, to naturally occurring cat fibrosarcomas in situ. GAL-TEK contains an in-frame fusion of the bacterial LacZ gene for histochemical marking of tumors with beta-galactosidase (beta-Gal) and the HSV tk gene for enzyme-prodrug activation of the prodrug ganciclovir (GCV) to induce selective tumor cell killing. GAL-TEK bifunctional marking and cell killing activities were tested in vitro after adenoviral vector infection of HT1080 human fibrosarcoma cells. The tk activity of GAL-TEK is shown to be almost as potent as HSV tk to catalyze conversion of GCV to GCV nucleotides and promote selective cell killing. Using 8 cats with recurring 2.5-cm2 fibrosarcomas that either arose spontaneously or were induced by vaccine, we determined experimentally the administration routes and times required for optimum GAL-TEK gene transfer by beta-Gal histological staining and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction to the multiple compartments of the growing fibrosarcomas consonant with minimizing collateral infection of neighboring tissues and other unwanted side effects.
