GAR-936, a new glycylcycline, had lower MICs (< or =0.016 to 0.125 microg/ml) for 201 penicillin- and tetracycline-susceptible and -resistant pneumococcal strains than tetracycline (< or = 0.06 to 128 microg/ml), minocycline (< or =0.06 to 16.0 microg/ml), or doxycycline (< or =0.06 to 32.0 microg/ml). GAR-936 was also bactericidal against 11 of 12 strains tested at the MIC after 24 h, with significant kill rates at earlier time points.
