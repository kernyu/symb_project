We report on six cases of sepsis caused by Serratia marcescens in patients with neutropenia. Four cases showed an additional involvement of the upper respiratory and digestive tract with oral and pharyngeal mucositis, haemorrhagic laryngo-tracheo-bronchitis, and oedematous swelling of the face. One patient showed a Serratia marcescens carrier state in the pharynx over a period of months without neutropenia. The isolated strains showed a broad spectrum of resistance against antibiotics; only aztreonam and amikacin were effective in vitro against all isolates.
