A 33-year-old woman with autoimmune hepatitis developed resistance to prednisolone-azathioprine treatment. A switch to cyclosporin A resulted in immediate remission which was maintained for more than one year. No significant side effect was encountered. Cyclosporin A may be an alternative treatment for patients with autoimmune hepatitis who are resistant to conventional treatment.
