A heterologous DNA-mediated transformation system was developed for the pneumocandin-producing fungus Z. arboricola that was based on either conferral of hygromycin B resistance or complementation of a nitrate reductase mutant. Hygromycin-resistant transformants were selected with plasmid pCSN43 which contains the E. coli hygromycin B phosphotransferase gene under the control of Aspergillus nidulans trpC transcription signals. Transformation frequencies were about four transformants per microgram of circular DNA and could be improved four- to six-fold by linearizing the transforming DNA. The transformants differed from one another with respect to the copy number of the integrated plasmid and the site of integration. Adding an autonomously-replicating sequence (AMA1) from A. nidulans to pCSN43 enhanced transformation three-fold and produced, in addition, numerous abortive transformants. However, it is unlikely that the AMA1 sequence promoted plasmid replication in Z. arboricola. Nitrate reductase mutants of Z. arboricola were isolated by positive selection on chlorate-containing medium, and one mutant was subsequently transformed with pSTA700 which contains the nitrate reductase gene (niaD) from Cephalosporium acremonium. Introduction of the niaD gene restored sensitivity to chlorate in the mutant; therefore, using the niaD gene as a selectable marker provides a system for both positive and negative selection. To our knowledge, this is the first report describing transformation of a member of the genus Zalerion.
