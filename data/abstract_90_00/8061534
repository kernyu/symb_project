The sensitivity of Staphylococcus aureus to the principal antibiotics has been studied in a hospital environment during the period of 1989 to 1992. The resistance to methicillin was important in 1989, 1990, and 1991 (respectively 20.5; 24 and 25%). It showed an important decrease in 1992: 5%. The outstanding point over this last period is the appearance of a lower number of multi-resistant strains: M penicillin, aminoglycosides, macrolides. These strains represented 9, 10 and 11.5% in 1989, 1990 and 1991 and only 4% in 1992. This study indicates the need for increased control of the ecology and distribution of resistant strains.
