The rapid global expansion of bacteria resistant to antimicrobials is the most important development over the past year in emerging bacterial diseases. The critical events are the emergence of Staphylococcus aureus with decreased sensitivity to vancomycin, worldwide resistance to penicillin in Streptococcus pneumoniae, and the remorseless progression of multiply-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Most startling was the isolation from a human in Madagascar of a plague bacillus possessing a plasmid readily transferable to Escherichia coli, which confers multiple antibiotic resistance. The hospital environment continues to see the transmission of resistant organisms, notably vancomycin-resistant enterococci. Finally, as food markets become more open around the world, food-borne outbreaks of E. coli O157 and cholera demonstrate how difficult it can be to establish effective health and safety barriers.
