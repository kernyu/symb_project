Methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus is one of the important patholonic bacteria which cause nosocomial infection. In order to investigate the resistant antibiotic circumstances of this organism and hence provide foundations of prevention and treatment, we determined the resistant rates of 88 staphylococcus strains for methicillin and for other 14 kinds of commonly used antibiotics, and we determined the engendering beta-lactamase. The results showed that the isolation rate of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was 56%; the rate of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus coagulase-negative (MRSCoN) was 47.6%; the resistance rate and the multi-resistant rate of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus (MRS) for the 14 kinds of antibiotics were higher as compared with those of methicillin-sensitive (MSSA). Among all the tested strains, MRSA was the highest to engender beta-lactamase (92.9%); Methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus coagulase-negative (MSSCoN) was the lowest (39.4%). MRS was sensitive to vancomycin and furantoin. These suggest that when treating this bacterium, we should select these two antibiotics first.
