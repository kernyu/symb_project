The prevalence of oral colonization with Candida species was studied in 28 HIV-seropositive and 28 healthy persons. Candida was cultured from 75% and 68% of HIV-positive and control persons, respectively, with a significantly higher density carriage in the HIV-seropositive group. Positive smears were seen in 39% of all patients. Candida albicans was the most frequently isolated species with Biotype 1 accounting for 56% of the isolates. Resistance to antifungal agents was seen in Candida strains isolated from both groups.
