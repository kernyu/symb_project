Thirteen strains of P. mallei were found to be highly sensitive to ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin and resistant to norfloxacin. Ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin showed a high efficacy on models of malleus in guinea pigs and hamsters. The animals were infected with various strains of P. mallei. In the in vitro experiments, ciprofloxacin proved to be the most active and efficient. Norfloxacin appeared to be inefficient.
