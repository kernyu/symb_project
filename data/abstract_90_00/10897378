Nucleotide sequences of domain V and domain II regions of the 23S rRNA gene were determined in both in vitro-made mutants and clinical isolates of Mycobacterium avium and M. intracellulare conferring clarithromycin-resistance. All laboratory-made mutants showed high level resistance to clarithromycin (> 150 micrograms ml-1) and mutation at position 2058 (cognate with Escherichia coli base) in domain V region. In the clinical isolates, while the susceptible ones had no mutation in domain V, the resistant strains showed mutation at 2058 or 2059. Six isolates with low level of resistance exhibited no mutation in domain V. All strains tested had no mutation in domain II region. These results suggested that most of the resistance arose from the mutation in domain V of the 23S rRNA gene, but other unknown mechanisms evidently exist in mycobacteria.
