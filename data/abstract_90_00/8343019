BACKGROUND: Neonatal sepsis due to Streptococcus pneumoniae is relatively rare. The increasing risk that this bacterium is resistant to betalactam antibiotics worsens its prognosis. CASE REPORT: A newborn was delivered by cesarean section because of an abnormal fetal heart rate pattern. Despite intubation, respiratory support and correction of acidosis, the baby remained cyanotic and displayed signs of shock. Neutropenia, increased percentage of immature neutrophils, high C-reactive protein levels and an X-ray pattern of pneumonia also indicated an infection. The child was given symptomatic therapy, and amoxicillin, cefotaxime and amikacin. Pneumococci type 9 were isolated from peripheral secretions and from the blood. Deterioration of the respiratory condition required higher doses of amoxicillin and cefotaxime on day 2 pending the results of antibiotic sensitivity testing. This test showed that the strains were resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics. On day 3, the treatment was replaced by a combination of vancomycin, rifampicin, amikacin and cefotaxime. This treatment was pursued for 2 weeks, except for rifampicin which was stopped after 2 days. The follow-up was uneventful. A search for pneumococci in the mother was negative. CONCLUSIONS: Streptococcus pneumoniae should always be considered as a cause of neonatal sepsis. Poor therapeutic control indicates resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics. This patient may be the first reported case of maternal-fetal infection with this resistant strain.
