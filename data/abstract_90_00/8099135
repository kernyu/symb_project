The in vitro daunorubicin (DNR) cell uptake was investigated by flow cytometry in K562/DOX resistant cell line and in 42 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The proportion of cells able to take up DNR was higher in untreated patients (50% +/- 30) than in previously treated patients (31% +/- 31) (p = 0.04). We noted a good correlation (p < 0.001) between the drug uptake after exposure to 0.1 microM DNR and achievement of complete remission. Cyclosporin A (CsA, 1 microgram/ml) and verapamil (5 micrograms/ml), but not cefoperazone (10 mM), completely reversed (CsA) or partially reversed (verapamil) the DNR efflux from K562/DOX mdr1(+) cell line. CsA significantly increased (p < 0.01) the DNR uptake of fresh leukemic cells, but not consistently, with no relationship to mdr1 mRNA cellular level. This absence of correlation was explained by the fact that several patients with no mdr1 gene expression exhibited a low in vitro DNR uptake, showing that the MDR phenotype is not the only mechanism responsible for the alteration of DNR pharmacokinetics in AML.
