A total of 432 high vaginal swabs from patients with vulvovaginitis were processed for the presence of yeasts. Candida species were isolated from 40 (32.4%). In comparison, vaginal swabs from 107 normal asymptomatic women yielded only eight (7.3%) isolates (P < 0.001). Candida albicans was the commonest species isolated (76%). Other species included C. tropicalis, C. krusei, C. kefyr, C. glabrata and C. guilliermondii. Of the C. albicans isolates, 42.8% showed in vitro resistance to miconazole and 6.6% to econazole. Ninety-two percent of the isolates were sensitive to the polyenes (nystatin and amphotericin B) and 87% and 74% to clotrimazole and ketaconazole respectively.
