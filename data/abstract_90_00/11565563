Vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) is a world-wide emerging pathogen. The first confirmed VRE isolate in Taiwan was detected in 1995. After that, more and more isolates of VRE were found in western part of Taiwan. However, before this report, there was no any isolate of VRE found in eastern part of Taiwan. In December 1997 and January 1998, two cases of VRE urinary tract infection were found in two regional hospitals in north-eastern Taiwan. They had received prolonged treatment with multiple antibiotics for other infections before they got VRE infection. The isolates showed susceptibility to other antimicrobial agents by routine disk diffusion susceptibility test and these two patients were successfully treated. The VRE did not spread in those two hospitals. After further study, the 3 isolates from these two patients all had minimum inhibitory concentration of vancomycin >256 microg/mL. They all carried van A gene and the pulsed-field gel electrophoresis demonstrated they belonged to different DNA types. It was concluded that VRE appeared in north-eastern Taiwan but the strains were not from a common source.
