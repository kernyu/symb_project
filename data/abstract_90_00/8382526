Murine L517BY (LY) lymphoma sublines, LY-R (X-radiation resistant) and LY-S (X-radiation sensitive) displayed a difference in susceptibility to camptothecin: susceptibility of LY-S cells to the alkaloid was shifted towards higher concentrations as compared to LY-R cells. A similar difference was observed at the level of genomic DNA when a number of DNA-protein cross-links was determined or single-strand breaks were revealed by the fluorescent nucleoid halo assay. Activities of topoisomerases I and II were the same in both sublines. In turn, a higher resistance to camptothecin was found for the isolated LY-S topoisomerase I in the DNA cleavage test, suggesting that an altered enzyme was responsible for the susceptibility difference observed at the cellular level. In the relaxation test the enzymes from the two sublines showed a different sensitivity to beta-lapachone, an activator of topoisomerase I, but were similarly sensitive to all inhibitors, except camptothecin.
