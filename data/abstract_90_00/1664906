Aminoglycoside-phosphotransferases contain several conserved amino acid sequence motifs. Using hydroxylamine we have obtained five independent missense mutations within the aphA-2 gene of transposon Tn5. Four of the mutations dramatically reduced antibiotic resistance. Two were identical and included the replacement of His-188 with Tyr. One other resulted from the replacement of Gly-189 with Asp. These three mutations map within the first of the conserved motifs. The replacement of Asp-261 with Asn maps to the third of these structural motifs. A mutation diminishing but not eliminating aminoglycoside resistance resulted from replacement of the conserved Val-36 with Met. By site-directed mutagenesis three additional mutants were obtained: His-188 was replaced with Leu and Ser, and Arg-211 within the second conserved motif was substituted by Gly. All three showed reduced levels of resistance to kanamycin. Our results show that these conserved motifs are essential for the biological activity of aminoglycoside phosphotransferases.
