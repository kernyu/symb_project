Population analysis of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and determination of their sensitivity to antimicrobial agents were performed. It was found, that the methicillin-resistant strains belonged to resistance classes II and III. All methicillin-resistant S. aureus were susceptible to ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, vancomycin and teicoplanin. Differences between classes were observed in susceptibility to erythromycin and gentamicin.
