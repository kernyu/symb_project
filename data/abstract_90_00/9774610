In vitro susceptibility patterns of newer beta-lactamase-inhibiting antibiotics ampicillin-sulbactam (A/S) and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (A/C) for 100 consecutive isolates of Acinetobacter baumannii obtained from various clinical samples were studied. The A/C MIC for 86% of the strains was more than 16/8 microgram/ml, whereas there was an A/S MIC of more than 16/8 microgram/ml for only 38% of the strains. This showed that A/S has significantly superior in vitro activity compared to A/C against A. baumannii, although, theoretically, both should have similar activities. The therapeutic superiority of A/S over A/C needs to be studied, or else the breakpoints for these agents in in vitro tests need to be redefined.
