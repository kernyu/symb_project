The data on antibiotic sensitivity of 38 strains of S. pneumoniae isolated from children and 46 strains isolated from carriers are presented. The isolates from the carriers had significantly higher sensitivity to benzylpenicillin, ampicillin, methicillin, oxacillin, cefazolin, erythromycin, oleandomycin and lincomycin. Resistance to gentamicin was more frequent in the strains isolated from the carriers. Among the strains of S. pneumoniae isolated from the patients and carriers representatives of serovar K19 were more frequent. There were no statistically reliable difference in them by sensitivity to benzylpenicillin, ampicillin, cefazolin, lincomycin and rifampicin. Still, the isolates from the carriers were much more sensitive to methicillin, oxacillin, oleandomycin and erythromycin.
