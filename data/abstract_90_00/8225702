The in-vitro interaction between clindamycin and trimethoprim was tested on 10 staphylococcal clinical isolates by the checkerboard technique and by the time-kill curve. Indifference was demonstrated against seven of these strains and antagonism against three. The clindamycin/trimethoprim combination is of no value if the purpose of the combination is to obtain synergy against staphylococci. However, the combination is useful against mild polymicrobial infections due to Gram-positive aerobes, anaerobes and Enterobacteriaceae.
