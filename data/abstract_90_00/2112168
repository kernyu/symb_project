In a long-term, open study, 47 patients with epidermolysis bullosa were treated with topical 2% mupirocin (Bactroban) ointment to decrease bacterial infection and promote wound healing. This antibiotic is effective against gram-positive but not gram-negative organisms. No significant adverse effects were noted, although some patients have been treated for more than 4 years. We sought evidence in this patient population for the appearance of bacterial strains with decreased sensitivity to mupirocin. In five patients cultures from nonhealing wounds revealed Staphylococcus aureus resistance to mupirocin. Four of these patients were given oral antibiotics to which S. aureus was sensitive; they improved clinically, and cultures of their wounds became negative for pathogens.
