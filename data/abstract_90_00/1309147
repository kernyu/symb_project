We report the isolation of 10 strains of enterobacteriaceae with a new quinolone's resistance. This resistance was detected by a diminution of inhibition's diameter around the disk of pefloxacin , and confirmed by the determination of Minimal Inhibiting Concentrations (M.I.C.). These strains, moreover multiresistant to multiple antibiotics, were isolated from patient's urines with repetitive urinary tract infections (paraplegics, lithiasic patients). None of this patients was treated by new quinolones. The incorrect use of old quinolones is probably responsible for the selection of this new quinolone's resistance.
