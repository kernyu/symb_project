Strains of Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) are more frequently beta-lactamase-negative than those of Methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA). In the strains of MRSA, the beta-lactamase activity tends to be inversely related to the MIC's of Methicillin. Such a marked tendency has been observed in recent years.
