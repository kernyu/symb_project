The effect of fosfomycin against 69 vancomycin-resistant isolates of Enterococcus faecium (VanA), five of E. faecium (VanB), 11 of Enterococcus faecalis (VanA), three of E. faecalis (VanB), 10 of Enterococcus gallinarum (VanC1) and two of Enterococcus casseliflavus (VanC2) and glycopeptide-sensitive E. faecium (n = 8) and E. faecalis (n = 10) was tested in vitro. Fosfomycin inhibited 97%, 94% and 96% of the vancomycin-resistant strains, according to results of agar dilution, broth microdilution, and a disc diffusion method (DIN 58940). The disc diffusion test by the NCCLS method does not include fosfomycin; using breakpoints suggested by Andrews et al. (< or = 11 mm, resistant; > or = 18 mm, susceptible), 5% of the vancomycin-resistant strains tested would have been considered fosfomycin resistant. Minimal inhibitory concentrations of most vancomycin-resistant isolates were in the intermediate sensitivity range, yielding an MIC50 of 32 mg/L and an MIC90 of 64 mg/L. Moreover the majority of inhibitory zone sizes by the disc diffusion method (DIN 58940) corresponded to intermediate susceptibility. These results suggest that fosfomycin at a high dosage and possibly used in combination with other drugs could be a potentially useful drug for the treatment of infections caused by vancomycin-resistant enterococci.
