Sulfonamide (Su) and trimethoprim (Tp) resistance are known to caused by the production of drug resistant dihydropteroate synthase (DHPS) and dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), respectively. Sulfonamide and trimethoprim are often used in combination under the name cotrimoxazole. Cotrimoxazole resistance in various enteric bacteria isolated at Ramathibodi Hospital was studied. The rate of resistance from 1984-1989 of many genera was rather constant at 40%-60% except in Shigella spp in which the rate increased rapidly in 1987 till 1989. Seventy-five percent of Su-Tp resistant (Sur-Tpr) bacteria were also found to be resistant to other drugs such as ampicillin, aminoglycosides, tetracycline and chloramphenicol in addition to cotrimoxazole. Two hundred and forty Su-Tp resistant strains were analysed for the presence of type I and II dihydropteroate synthase as well as type I and V dihydrofolate reductase genes by hybridization with the corresponding gene probes. Type I DHPS gene predominated in Su-Tp resistant bacteria at 60.8% whereas type II DHPS was found in only 25%. Some strains (11.7%) had both genotypes but 2.5% did not have any. In the trimethoprim resistance study, the DHFR type I gene was also found more frequently (30%) whereas type V DHFR was only 19%. The remaining of Tp resistance (51%) was unclassified. The coexistence of Su and Tp resistance genes of each type was investigated among 118 Su and Tp resistant strains. It was found that type I DHPS gene was found together with either type I or V DHFR gene and type II DHPS was found with type I DHFR gene at about the same rate (28.9%, 27.1% and 26.3%, respectively). However, the presence of type II DHPS together with type V DHFR was rather low, only 5.9% of isolates were found to have both types of genes.
