The relative contribution of hyperglycaemia and hypoinsulinaemia was evaluated in rats made diabetic by streptozotocin administration. Four groups of rats were studied: untreated normal rats; streptozotocin-diabetic; streptozotocin-diabetic treated with phlorizin (0.4 mg/kg body weight per day); streptozotocin-diabetic mildly treated with insulin (0.7 IU/day). In all groups, insulin action (responsiveness) was assessed with the euglycaemic (5.3 mmol/l) hyperinsulinaemic (524 mU/l) clamp technique combined with 3H-2-deoxy-D-glucose method, enabling determination of the glucose utilization index in various tissues. Responsiveness of the overall glucose utilization process to insulin was reduced by 28% in streptozotocin-diabetic rats (12.0 +/- 1.2 vs 16.5 +/- 0.6 mg.kg-1.min-1, p less than 0.001). This was associated with a significant reduction (p less than 0.05) in the glucose utilization index in all muscles studied (average = 17.0 vs 32.1 ng.mg of tissue-1.min-1), in the heart (19.6 vs 39.5 ng.mg-1.min-1), brown adipose tissue (98.9 vs 178.0 ng.mg-1.min-1), skin (6.4 vs 13.1 ng.mg-1.min-1). Phlorizin treatment normalized plasma glucose levels without affecting those of insulin, and restored overall glucose utilization to normal (16.6 +/- 1.0 mg.kg-1.min-1). This normalization was accompanied by a normalization of the glucose utilization index in all muscle types studied (29.2 ng.mg-1.min-1), in the heart (50.0 ng.mg-1.min-1), brown adipose tissue (157.2 ng.mg-1.min-1), and skin (10.0 ng.mg-1.min-1). White adipose tissue, brain and gut were not affected.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
