In vitro activity of 13 antibiotics and drug preparations as well as some of their combinations was studied with respect to Brucella melitensis. It was shown that the strains of B. melitensis were sensitive to sisomicin, amikacin, gentamicin, cefotaxime, rifaprim +, nitroxoline and trimethoprim. Variations in the doxycycline sensitivity depending on the strain were observed. The strains of B. melitensis were resistant to cephalexin, phosphomycin, chinoxydine, dioxydine and oxolinic acid. Combinations of sisomicin and trimethoprim at a ratio of 1:10 and sisomicin and nitroxoline at a ratio of 1:2 had a summation effect.
