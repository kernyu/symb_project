Resistance to antimicrobial drugs has compromised control of many bacterial pathogens. For foodborne pathogens, the most likely source of resistance is use of antimicrobials in food-producing animals. To control the human health impact from use of antimicrobials in animals, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently announced plans to assess the microbial safety of all antimicrobials intended for use in food-producing animals. This paper describes the history of antimicrobial use and regulation in animals, the public health concern, the current animal drug approval process in the United States, the international perspective, and FDA's proposed procedures to evaluate the human health impact of the antimicrobial effects associated with animal drugs intended for use in food-producing animals. The primary public health goal of the improved regulatory paradigm is to ensure that significant human antimicrobial therapies are not lost due to use of antimicrobials in food animals.
