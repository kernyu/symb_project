Because of the limited ability of the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards proposed M27P methodology to detect resistance to amphotericin B by Candida isolates, we sought to identify alternative media and pH conditions that could reliably identify resistant isolates. Antibiotic Medium 3 broth (also known as Penassay broth) buffered to pH 5 or pH 7 produced superior results and readily identified a series of resistant isolates.
