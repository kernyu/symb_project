The agar dilution method was used to determine the antimicrobial activity of 17 antimicrobial agents against 132 strains belonging to the genus Bacteroides and 25 strains from the genus Fusobacterium, all isolated from 120 clinical cases of caprine footrot between October 1987 and November 1988. Josamycin, chloramphenicol and rifampin proved to be the most effective antibiotics in vitro. Significant resistance was found to the other antimicrobial agents studied.
