A chromosomal Tn5 insertion resulting in complete resistance to the peptide antibiotic microcin 25 was mapped to the min 4 region of the Escherichia coli genetic map. Additional experiments showed that the insertion disrupted the fhuA gene, which encodes the multifunctional outer membrane receptor for ferrichrome, the antibiotic albomycin, colicin M, and bacteriophages T5, T1, and phi 80. Thus, microcin 25 and all of these agents share the same receptor.
