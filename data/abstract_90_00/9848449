The activity of sanfetrinem (previously GV104326), was assessed against 168 isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae and 90 isolates of Staphylococcus aureus. These isolates included a range of serotypes or phage types, and varied in their susceptibility to other antibiotics. Sanfetrinem exhibited good anti-pneumococcal activity, with MIC90s of < or = 0.007 mg/L and 0.5 mg/L for penicillin-susceptible and penicillin-resistant isolates, respectively. Sanfetrinem was also active against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci (MIC90 = 0.06 mg/L). However, the MICs of sanfetrinem for isolates with methicillin MICs of 8-16 mg/L and > or = 32 mg/L were 0.25-1 mg/L and 8->32 mg/L, respectively.
