In staphylococci, linked resistance to the aminoglycosides kanamycin, neomycin, paromomycin, and tobramycin (KmNmPmTmr) is generally mediated by an aadD determinant which encodes production of an adenyltransferase aminoglycoside modifying enzyme, AAD(4',4''). The aadD resistance determinant is located on small multicopy plasmids such as pUB110, and has also been found on large multiresistance plasmids and on the chromosome in some strains. Examination of two conjugative plasmids from strains of Staphylococcus aureus isolated in North America indicated that the aadD determinant on these plasmids is located on an integrated copy of pUB110. The integrated pUB110 is flanked by direct repeats of the staphylococcal insertion sequence IS257. Analysis of the conjugative plasmid pSK41 showed an 8-bp duplication of the pUB110 sequence immediately adjacent to flanking IS257 elements, suggesting that integration of pUB110 was mediated by IS257.
