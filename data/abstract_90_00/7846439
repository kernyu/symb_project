This paper describes the incidence of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria susceptible to antibacterial agents. The data are based on all susceptibility tests performed at the Department of Medical Microbiology of the University of Zurich. The evaluation of the results from 1987 to 1993 shows that susceptibilities against the antimicrobial agents tested have not changed markedly in this period with few exceptions. The tables may be of help to the physician in his decision for a 'calculated chemotherapy' of bacterial infections.
