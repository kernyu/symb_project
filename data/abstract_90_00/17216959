Forty five positive blood culture acute typhoid cases were studied during a 2 years period (1997-1999) in Abbassia Fever hospital, Cairo, Egypt. Their ages ranged between 4-23 (12 +/- 2.5) years. Male: Female ratio was 1:1. Three of the 4 classical signs namely: toxic look (84%), bronchitic chest (47%), tumid tympanitic abdomen (84%) and just palpable receding spleen (69%) were found in almost all cases and offer a good bed side clinical diagnostic test. Blood picture revealed anaemia, within normal white blood count and thrombocytopenia. Liver function tests showed within normal total serum bilirubin, two or more folds increase of ALT and within normal serum alkaline phosphatase. Comparing the 3 tests, namely significant Widal titre (56%), modified Widal test (89%) and bright spleen (78%), it was found that modified Widal test is the most sensitive serological test. Ultrasonographic finding of bright spleen is an easy, safe, noninvasive and sensitive technique which is relatively cheap. Each of the 3 drugs in our study namely chloramphenicol, quinolones and ceftriaxone resulted in improvement of general condition, drop of fever, increase in haemoglobin, white blood count and platelet count. Also, there was a significant improvement of liver function tests by either of the 3 drugs. Ceftriaxone is the best drug from the clinical and laboratory points of view followed by quinolones in multidrug resistant (MDR) acute typhoid cases. Chloramphenicol is still the drug of choice in chloramphenicol sensitive salmonellae.
