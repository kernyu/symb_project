Hypertension is frequently associated with insulin resistance and enhanced sympathetic activity supposedly mediated by an effect of the hormone on the hypothalamus. In this study we sought to determine whether insulin modifies the functional activity of the hypothalamus and other brain areas of spontaneously hypertensive (SHR) and normotensive WKY rats. The study was carried out in control and hyperinsulinemic, normoglycemic rats. Insulin plasma levels were increased to 198 +/- 10 (WKY) or 220 +/- 10 microunits/ml (SHR). Brain functional activity was evaluated by the 2-[14C]deoxyglucose method for measuring local rates of glucose utilization. The results show that insulin has no effect on any of the brain areas examined including the hypothalamus, of both WKY and SHR rats. The two strains of rats have comparable cerebral metabolic rates also under basal conditions.
