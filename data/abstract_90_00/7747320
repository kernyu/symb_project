The response in vitro of Plasmodium falciparum to chloroquine, mefloquine and quinine was studied in a hyperendemic peri-urban area of Accra, Ghana, during the fourth quarter of 1991, yielding a total of 159 valid tests. Schizont maturation in drug-free controls and effective chloroquine concentrations were strongly correlated. This was not seen with mefloquine or quinine. Higher mean parasitaemia in untreated oligo-symptomatic carriers of overtly chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum than in carriers of more sensitive parasites was another indication of higher viability and biological advantage of chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum that may conceivably have clinical implications.
