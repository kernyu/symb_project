The kinetics of growth and metabolism of Clostridium thermosaccharolyticum DSM 571 has been studied at varying initial pH and glucose concentration. A weak inhibitory effect of excess glucose on the specific growth rate has been shown. The effect of antibiotics of various classes on culture growth and hydrogen evolution has been studied. Streptomycin and kanamycin resistance of this culture has been revealed as well as the phenomenon of increased hydrogen production in the presence of the above antibiotics. New plasmids, pNB1 (4.9 kb) and pNB2 (2.0 kb), were isolated from C. thermosaccharolyticum DSM 571. The restriction analysis of pNB1 and pNB2 has been performed.
