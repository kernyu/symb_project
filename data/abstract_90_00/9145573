Two hundred women in early second trimester were recruited in a study to monitor the utilisation of antimalarial drugs prescribed for prophylaxis or treatment of malaria during their attendance at the antenatal clinic of Muhimbili Medical Centre. Information regarding the use of antimalarial drugs was obtained during an interview using a structured questionnaire and antenatal cards. The study revealed that 51.5% had taken antimalarials for treatment of acute malaria while 23.5% had taken for prophylaxis. There was thus a total exposure of 75%. most of them were exposed to choloroquine (69.5l%). There was no statistically significant association between the taking of chloroquine and its presence in urine and between the level of education and the taking of chloroquine prophylactically.
