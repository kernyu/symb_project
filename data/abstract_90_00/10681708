OBJECTIVE: To inform the isolation and antibiotics susceptibility results of Haemophilus in the sputum of old men suffering from respiratory tract disease so that the epidemiological information and treatment can be available to physicians. METHODS: Two groups-group A, patients=562, group B, healthy volunteers=57 expectorated specimens of sputum were cultured with a special medium for Haemophilus. The isolates were then identified with API NH Identification plates and detected with ATB NH antibiotics susceptibility cards, finally, we got the statistics data of Haemophilus species and antibiotics susceptibility rates from Datatrac statistic system of VITEK 32. RESULTS: Haemophilus were detected in 132 specimens out of 562 (23.5%), which includes 6 strains of H. influenzae (4.5%). 122 strains of H. parainfluenzae, 4 strains of H. aphrophilus (3.1%). At the same time, 3 strains of Haemophilus were isolated from group B. Following are the susceptibility rates of sixteen antibiotics of 132 strains of Haemophilus, 73.4% to amoxicillin, 92.4% to amoxicillin and clavulanic acid, 83.3% to cefactor, 90.9% to cefotaxime, 79.5% to cefuroxime-axetil, 52.3% to kanamycin, 25.0% to gentamycin, 72.0% to spectinomycin, 79.5% to chloramphenicol, 50.0% to tetracycline, 9.1% to erythromycin, 42.4% to pristhomycin, 49.2% to rosoxacin, 62.96% to pefloxacin, 97.7% to rifampin, 33.3% to sulfonamides. CONCLUSION: There is a high isolation rate of Haemophilus in the sputum of the elderly suffering from respiratory tract diseases, The H. parainfluenzae is the main Haemophilus in our area of study, which it deserves good attention by clinical microbiological laboratory. In addition, the antibiotics susceptibility results indicate that this species is more susceptible to beta-lactams antibiotics and is less susceptible to some others such as macrolides and aminoglycosides, etc. So, the drug treatment should be based on these antibiotics susceptibility results in order to guide the specific therapy.
