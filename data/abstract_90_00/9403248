The natural element iodine has been used for more than 150 years to prevent infection and treat wounds. Yet only due to the development of iodophors has it become possible to use this highly efficient microbicide in a wide range of medical applications. The antimicrobial spectrum is universal. Its efficiency against clinically and epidemiologically significant new pathogens, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus sp. has also been validated. No development of resistance has been determined. New data are also available on the excellent local tolerability of Betaisodona (povidone-iodine) preparations. On these grounds, a number of clinical fields exist in prophylaxis and therapy, for either once only or repeated applications: the disinfection of hands and skin, mucosa antisepsis, intra- and postoperative wound treatment, therapy of skin infections, burns and chronic wounds.
