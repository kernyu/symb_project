Spinal cord injured patients are highly prone to urinary tract infections. The high frequency of recurrences, the problems with drug resistance and the difficulties associated with diagnosis complicate the management. In a preliminary retrospective study of 30 patient files, we discovered that prophylactic antimicrobial therapy with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, significantly reduced the incidence of symptomatic urinary tract infections. The prevention of infection resulted in cheaper healthcare expenses than treatment. ONe problematic outcome was that antibiotic therapy resulted in a dramatic change in the population of uropathogens infecting the host, from a predominantly Gram negative type to one dominated by Enterococcus faecalis.
