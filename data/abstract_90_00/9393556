From August 1991 to February 1992, each of the six largest hospitals throughout Norway collected 84 to 107 consecutive blood culture isolates of Enterobacteriaceae, altogether 571 isolates. The distribution of various species and genera at the different hospitals was uniform; Escherichia coli being most prevalent (57-67%), followed by Klebsiella spp. (12-18%) and Proteus mirabilis (7-11%). Twenty-one and 4% of E. coli isolates were resistant to ampicillin and cefuroxime, respectively, and 11% of Klebsiella isolates were cefuroxime resistant. Five Enterobacter isolates and one Citrobacter isolate were resistant to ceftazidime, and one Salmonella isolate was resistant to imipenem. All isolates were susceptible to ciprofloxacin and tobramycin. These results were compared with the antibiotic consumption in each hospital region. Although hospitals in the regions with the highest consumption of ampicillin tended to have a higher percentage of isolates resistant to this agent, no significant differences were found. There was no significant difference between hospitals regarding prevalence of cefuroxime-resistant isolates.
