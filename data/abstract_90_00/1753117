A case of septicaemia caused by Pediococcus pentosaceus is described. The role played by pediococci, and other vancomycin-resistant Gram-positive cocci, in disease states is examined. We suggest that in immunocompromised patients these organisms act as opportunist pathogens. This would appear to be the first reported case of P. pentosaceus septicaemia.
