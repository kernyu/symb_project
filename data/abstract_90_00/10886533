Interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha), either alone or in combination with ribavirin, is the standard treatment for patients with hepatitis C. However, most patients do not achieve a sustained remission with this treatment regimen. A number of studies have demonstrated that genotype, baseline viral load and/or a decrease in viral load early after treatment induction are the major predictive factors for response to treatment with IFN. Patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1 are more resistant to treatment with IFN, whereas low viral load at baseline and a marked decline in the HCV RNA level during the first 2-12 weeks of IFN therapy are associated with enhanced treatment efficacy. These variables could potentially be used to develop treatment algorithms that tailor therapies for specific clinical situations. Continued development and refinement of such algorithms would facilitate both the selection of patients who are most likely to benefit from therapy and the development of optimal treatment regimens for different patient groups. Predictive factors will also enable clinicians to identify subsets of patients who are not expected to respond well to current treatment. The development of new delivery methods for IFN that produce sustained antiviral pressure may provide a means of treating these previously difficult-to-treat patient groups.
