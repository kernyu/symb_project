Clinical as well as experimental studies have found an interindividual variability in the immunosuppressive effect of cyclosporine (CsA). In renal transplant patients treated with CsA and prednisolone alone, biopsy-verified rejections were significantly more frequent in DRw6-positive than in DRw6-negative graft recipients. The relative risk for developing a graft rejection independently of the CsA blood levels increased in HLA-DRw6-positive transplant patients. Although no statistical significance of the CsA levels within different DR phenotypes could be assessed, HLA-DR2-positive graft recipients with biopsy-verified rejection episodes had significantly lower CsA levels than DR2-negative patients (P = 0.01). Our results would indicate a very low CsA sensitivity of HLA-DRw6-positive graft recipients and might explain previous results describing an increased incidence of rejection and decreased graft survival rates in these patients.
