The activity of 37 antibiotics against 155 strains of Staphylococcus susceptible to methicillin (MS) and 107 strains of Staphylococcus resistant to methicillin (MR) was evaluated. Only vancomycin and teicoplanin remained active in relation to all the studied Staphylococcus strains. A high activity also was demonstrated by netilmicin (99.57%) and quinolones (more than 90%). The percentage of strains resistant to aminoglycoside, linkosamide, fluoroquinolones and other antibiotics was found to be higher within MR strains than in MS strains. All strains resistant to rifampin belonged to the MR Staphylococcus group. Among the 6 studied fluoroquinolones ofloxacin (97.71%) was found to be the most active. Three Staphylococcus aureus strains (MICOFX 16 micrograms/ml), one S-haemolyticus strain and one S. epidermidis strain (MICOFX 8 micrograms/ml) were the most resistant.
