The correlation between disc diffusion and agar dilution susceptibility testing of five antibiotics was studied against 145 Campylobacter strains: 99 Campylobacter jejuni subsp. jejuni and 46 Campylobacter coli. The percentages of true results and 95% CI for disc diffusion for resistant strains were 100% (93.2-100%) for tetracycline (53 strains tested), 100% (77.2-100%) for ciprofloxacin (13 strains tested), 86.7% (62.1-96.3%) for nalidixic acid (15 strains tested), 100% (56.6-100%) for erythromycin (five strains tested) and 68.8% (44.4-85.8%) for ampicillin (16 strains tested). The percentages of true results and 95% CI were 97.6-100% and 93.2-100% respectively for 89-140 susceptible strains to the five antibiotics tested. There was a 1.4% major error for nalidixic acid, 0.7% very major error for erythromycin, 5.5% and 1.4% minor and major errors respectively for ampicillin. There was complete agreement for ciprofloxacin and tetracycline. Results of ampicillin susceptibility are not expected to be useful in a clinical setting. The nalidixic acid disc is a marker of ciprofloxacin susceptibility as the nalidixic acid-susceptible strains were susceptible to ciprofloxacin while most of the resistant ones were resistant to ciprofloxacin. Overall, our results suggest that disc diffusion is a reliable, easy and inexpensive susceptibility testing method for C. jejuni and C. coli for erythromycin, ciprofloxacin and tetracycline. Until more erythromycin- and ciprofloxacin-resistant strains are tested to confirm the reliability of this test, the resistance to these drugs needs to be confirmed using the Etest or the agar dilution method.
