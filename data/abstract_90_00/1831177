Over the last few years the number of patients with chronic bilateral blepharitis has increased dramatically. From January 1985 until the end of 1989, a total of 407 patients with this diagnosis underwent ophthalmological and dermatological investigations at our out-patient clinic. Keratoconjunctivitis sicca (KCS) in conjunction with blepharitis occurred in 14.5% of the patient population who also suffered from acne rosacea. A comparison of the spectrum of microorganisms that have previously been isolated from affected sites with data obtained in the present study revealed that the range of microorganisms associated with this chronic localized inflammation has apparently shifted in recent years. The prevalence of Staphylococcus aureus, which was considerable in the pre-antibiotic era, has markedly decreased, although a distinct entity of staphylococcal blepharitis seems to remain, either alone or in combination with seborrheic blepharitis (62.8% of our patients). The clinical picture, microbiological findings and therapy for this condition are presented.
