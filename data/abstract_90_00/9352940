Disruption of gene HI0894 or HI0895 in Haemophilus influenzae Rd, homologs of Escherichia coli acrAB multidrug efflux genes, caused hypersusceptibility to erythromycin, rifampin, novobiocin, and dyes such as ethidium bromide and crystal violet and increased accumulation of radioactive erythromycin, showing that these genes are expressed and contribute to the baseline level resistance of this organism through active drug efflux. The gene disruption did not produce detectable changes in susceptibility to several other antibiotics, possibly because rapid influx of small antibiotic molecules through the large H. influenzae porin channels counterbalances their efflux.
