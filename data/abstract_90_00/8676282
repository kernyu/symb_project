Diversity of culturable bacteria inhabiting the Baltic sea surface waters was studied in three separate locations. Based on electrophoretically separated whole cell proteins the number of operational taxonomic units (OTU) within each sampling location was high. Most of the OTUs were unique to single locations. Within each sampling location 8-22% of isolates belonged to a single OTU. Rarefaction analysis revealed that the bacterial community was more divergent at a polluted location than at clean areas. Also the most common OTUs were different in clean locations compared to the polluted site suggesting that both diversity and species composition of the bacterial community is greatly affected by pollution. The partial 16S rRNA gene sequences of the isolates of the most common OTUs are unique. Intragroup variation and an OTU-specific bacteriocin system was observed among the isolates of the second common OTU. The bacteriocin activity was linked to restriction fragment length polymorphism grouping, although additional variation correlating to geographic origin of isolates was observed.
