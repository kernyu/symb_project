Resistance of tumor cells to the antigrowth activity of several cytotoxic compounds has been associated with the expression of the so-called multidrug resistance protein or P-glycoprotein. This article addresses the question whether the expression of such protein could also affect the sensitivity of HIV to AZT. Our data indicate that this possibility does exist. In fact, multidrug-resistant CEM VBL100 cells, which express high levels of P-glycoprotein, are less sensitive to both the antiproliferative activity and the antiviral action of AZT. Additionally, our data suggest that this phenomenon is specifically mediated by P-glycoprotein since trifluoroperazine, which is known to circumvent multidrug resistance due to the action on P-glycoprotein, increases the intracellular accumulation of AZT and affects the sensitivity of HIV to AZT. Although the biological and clinical significance of these observations has still to be established, this study suggests that cellular factors, other than virus itself, should be taken into account to address the phenomenon of drug resistance of HIV.
