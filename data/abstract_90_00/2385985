Neamine-resistant mutants were obtained from S. abortus ovis virulent strain. These mutants were divided into three classes according to their sensitivity to streptomycin: mutants completely retaining their sensitivity, mutants sensitive to moderate and high doses of the antibiotic. On the basis of genetic analysis carried out with the use of bacteriophage P22, the Near mutation of class Near 100 Strr 500 mutants was identified as nea B, and the Near mutation of class Near 100 Strs, as nea A. The study showed a decreased virulence of Salmonella transductants that acquired both neamine-resistant mutation of the two classes and streptomycin-resistant mutation. The streptomycin-resistant mutation produced no changes in the virulence of these bacteria. According to the results of experiments on mice, mutants of the two classes under study were found to possess protective activity.
