Fifteen evaluable patients (mean age, 67 years) were enrolled to assess the efficacy of teicoplanin, 6 mg/kg given daily during the first 3 days and then on alternate days, for the treatment of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections. Eight patients had soft tissue infections, four catheter-associated bacteraemia, two osteomyelitis and one pneumonia. Clinical cure was observed in 13 of 15 patients. Both clinical and bacteriological failures were shown in the two patients with osteomyelitis. The mean serum levels of teicoplanin (mg/L) were 22, 8 and 6.7 for peak, 24 h and 48 h troughs, respectively. The dosage employed in this study proved effective in non-deep-seated MRSA infections.
