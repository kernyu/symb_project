A cross-sectional malaria survey was conducted during the rainy season in Bangangte (West-Cameroon), a town of 90,000 inhabitants located in the high tablelands zone of Cameroon. An in vivo study revealed that 50% of P. falciparum malaria patients were resistant to chloroquine (25 mg/kg over 3 days) and 26.3% to amodiaquine (35 mg/kg over 3 days) at a RII/RIII level. In addition, plasmodial indices indicated that malaria was mesoendemic in this area of Cameroon.
