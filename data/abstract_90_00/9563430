BACKGROUND: The number of methicillin-resistant STaphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections in the hospital setting is increasing but little is known of its prevalence in the community. In a 1986-1987 study, the prevalence in dermatology outpatient clinics was <0.9%. This study reports changes in the same facilities from 1988 through 1996. METHODS: Culture results and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns were reviewed for the population for the period 1988 through 1996. RESULTS: We report a gradual increase of MRSA from 1.5% of all strains of Staphylococcus aureus in 1988 to 11.9% in 1996 in these outpatient facilities. Susceptibility data indicate that the MRSA strains isolated in 1996 are more resistant to oral agents such as ciprofloxacin and tetracycline, while all strains remain susceptible to the intravenous agent vancomycin. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of MRSA in the community is increasing and should be considered when selecting a treatment regimen for staphylococcal infections.
