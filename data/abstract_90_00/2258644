Clinical and bacteriological studies were carried out to investigate the isolation of MRSA from clinical materials, during the 4 years from 1985 to 1988 at the Hokusho Central Hospital. The isolation frequency of MRSA from Staphylococcus aureus increased from 5.6% (3 strains) in 1985 to 50.0% (90 strains) in 1988. MRSA from sputum and pressure sore increased significantly. However MRSA from outpatient and inpatient in the ward for common people were constant, about 20%. Inpatients in the ward for aged person were increased significantly from 13.6% (3 strains) to 67.0% (67 strains). Most of the patients with positive MRSA isolation had background diseases (88.3%) and were bedridden (78.4%). Patients with cerebrovascular disease were 55.9% of all of the cases. But most of the MRSA strains were resistant to CZX, FOM, DMPPC, CMX, CEZ, CZON, CZX, most of the MRSA strains were sensitive to RFP, VCM, MINO, IPM/CS.
