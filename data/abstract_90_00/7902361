P-glycoprotein, a 170-kd glycoprotein encoded by the MDR 1 gene, is a member of a highly conserved superfamily of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transport proteins. It shares extensive homology with numerous bacterial and eukaryotic ABC transport proteins. P-glycoprotein acts as an energy-dependent efflux pump that appears to transport structurally diverse agents ranging from ions to peptides. P-glycoprotein (P-gP) has been implicated as playing a role in multidrug (MDR) resistance in cancer, chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium falciparum infection, and possibly human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) resistance to nucleoside compounds. A number of normal tissues in humans and rodents have been shown to express high levels of P-gp. The expression and function of P-gp in cells of the immune system have been explored in the past 2 years. This review presents a state of the art regarding the expression, regulation, and function of Pgp in cells of the immune system. In addition, its alteration in aging and HIV-1 infection is reviewed. A possible physiologic role of P-gp in cytokine secretion, antigen processing/presentation, and effector functions is also discussed.
