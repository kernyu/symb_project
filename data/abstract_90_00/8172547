Macrocyclic lactone endectocides include two chemically distinct compounds moxidectin, a milbemycin, and ivermectin, an avermectin. The significance of the chemical differences between these compounds in relation to nematode resistance remains to be established. Reported studies indicate that moxidectin at the recommended dose rate of 0.2 mg/kg controls identified strains of nematodes, isolated from sheep and goats, with demonstrated resistance to ivermectin. This reflects the significantly greater potency of moxidectin against the 3 genera of nematodes most commonly involved in anthelmintic resistance, Haemonchus, Ostertagia and Trichostrongylus. Moxidectin, in recommended strategic treatment programmes, should reduce the risk of further development of resistance to the macrocylic lactone endectocides.
