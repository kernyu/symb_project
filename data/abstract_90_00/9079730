Significant new advances at the molecular level in the field of plant-pathogen interactions form the basis for novel transgenic approaches to crop protection. The cloning of disease resistance genes and the dissection of the signal transduction components of the hypersensitive response and systemic acquired resistance pathways have greatly increased the diversity of options available for transgenic disease resistance. These new approaches will supplement our rapidly increasing repertoire of antimicrobial peptides, defense-related proteins and antimicrobial compounds. The combinatorial deployment of these strategies will be exploited for engineering effective and durable resistance to pathogens in the field. The integration of transgenic approaches with classical resistance breeding offers a potentially chemical-free and environmentally friendly solution for controlling pathogens.
