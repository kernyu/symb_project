An increasing number of clinical isolates of vancomycin resistant enterococci (VRE) have been reported in the literature since 1988. Only a few cases of beta-lactamase producing VRE have been described worldwide. This article reports the first case of beta-lactamase positive VRE in Australia. This strain of Enterococcus faecalis was isolated from a patient with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma who subsequently underwent a bone marrow transplant. Screening of all ward contacts did not detect any further case of beta-lactamase producing VRE. With the development of multiple antibiotic resistance in enterococci, additional infection surveillance protocols have been implemented in the hospital. These include routine screening of 'at risk' patients, instigating relevant infection control measures for management of VRE positive patients and controlling the usage of vancomycin in order to limit the development of resistant isolates.
