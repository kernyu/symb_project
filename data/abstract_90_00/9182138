An attempt has been undertaken to evaluate the aetiology of urinary tract infections in a large group of patients and to determine the resistance to ciprofloxacin during therapy, and the efficacy of the drug in treating of urinary tract infections. 52 patients with urinary tract infections were treated with ciprofloxacin. Ciprobay by BAYER was used in coated 500 mg tablets twice a day and intravenous solutions in 200 mg dosages every 12 hours for 10-14 days depending on the clinical condition. Microbiological tests were made according to general methods. Sensitivity evaluation to ciprofloxacin was done using E-tests by AB Biodisk and dilution tests. The most common a etiology of urinary tract infections were Gram-negative Enterobacteriaceae rods, mainly E. coli. Ciprofloxacin gave the best results against Enterobacteriaceae rods (100% eradications). In other infections, effective therapy was possible after determining of the sensitivity in vitro. S. haemolyticus bacteria tended significantly towards resistance to ciprofloxacin during therapy.
