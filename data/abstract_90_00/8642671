Products of human adenovirus (Ad) early region 3 (E3) inhibit both specific (cytotoxic T lymphocytes [CTLs]) and innate (tumor necrosis factor alpha [TNF-alpha]) immune responses in vitro. The E3 gp19K protein prevents CTL recognition of Ad-infected fibroblasts by sequestering major histocompatibility complex class I proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum. E3 proteins 10.4K, 14.5K, and 14.7K function to protect infected cells from TNF-alpha cytolysis. To address the in vivo functions of these proteins, Ad mutants that lack the E3 genes encoding these proteins were inoculated intranasally into C57BL/10SnJ (H-2b) mice. Mutants that lack the gp19K gene failed to alter CTL generation or to affect Ad-induced pulmonary infiltrates. Since gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) is capable of overcoming gp19K suppression of CTL lysis in vitro, mice were depleted of IFN-gamma and inoculated with gp19K mutants. Even when IFN-gamma was depleted, gp19K was incapable of altering pulmonary lesions. These resuls are not in accord with the function of gp19K in vitro and suggest that gp19K does not affect immune recognition in vivo during an acute virus infection, yet they do not exclude the possibility that gp19K blocks immune recognition of Ad during a persistent infection. In contrast, when mice were inoculated with Ad mutants that lack the TNF resistance genes (14.7K and either 10.4K or 14.5K), there was a marked increase in alveolar infiltration and no change in the amounts of perivascular/peribronchiolar infiltration compared with wild-type-Ad-induced pathology. These findings demonstrate the importance of TNF susceptibility and TNF by-products for recruiting inflammatory cells into the lungs during Ad infections.
