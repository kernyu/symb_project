An 8-yr retrospective study was conducted to evaluate the rate of Escherichia coli infection and antibiotic resistance of isolates from diseased broilers submitted for diagnosis in Trinidad from 1990 to 1997. Of a total of 906 cases of diseased birds subjected to postmortem examination, 603 (66.6%) had E. coli infection. The number of cases increased over the years from 16 in 1990 to a peak of 294 in 1996. For every year, at least 50% of all broiler cases had E. coli infection. The rate of infection was significantly higher during the rainy season (74.1 +/- 6.9%) than during the dry season (57.8 +/- 7.0%). Approximately 50% of all E. coli isolates were resistant to 9 out of a total of 11 antimicrobial drugs selected for the study. The isolates showed an increasing trend of resistance to amoxicillin, apramycin, gentamicin, nitrofurantoin, norfloxacin, and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim. However, only the trends of resistance to apramycin and norfloxacin were statistically significant. Overall, of the antimicrobial drugs selected, norfloxacin relatively appeared as the best choice for treatment. From this study, we conclude that the high rate of E. coli infection in broilers submitted for diagnosis along with the high resistance of isolates to antimicrobial drugs constitute a threat to the poultry industry on the island.
