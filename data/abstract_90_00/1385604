The predominant mechanism responsible for acute specific rejection of allogeneic and parental bone marrow by irradiated mice is due to a cell (TNK) that expresses the NK cell surface markers NK1 and ASGM1 as well as TCR. Here we analyze the question as to whether TNK cells require a functional thymus for their development. Using adoptive cell transfer assays, evidence is presented that, as is the case in normal mice, NK1+ CD3+ effector cells are responsible for rejection in thymus-deficient nude mice and that the specificity of rejection is indistinguishable from that of normal mice. To reveal the presence of TNK cells in the spleen of nude mice, double staining for NK1 and CD3 followed by FACS analysis was done. It is shown that NK1+ CD3+ cells are present in the spleens of nude but not euthymic mice, suggesting that the lack of a functional thymus stimulates either Ag expression or the number of TNK cells. In support of this finding, the treatment of irradiated marrow reconstituted mice with cyclosporin A leads to the appearance of TNK cells in the spleen. The relative efficiency of spleen cells from nude and cyclosporin A-treated mice to transfer resistance in adoptive cell transfers was assessed and found to be higher than that of normal spleen, consistent with the higher frequency of these cells in thymus-defective mice. The fate of NK1+ CD3+ cells subsequent to stimulation with an allogeneic marrow graft indicates that these cells proliferate in nude mice without gaining cytolytic activity. In euthymic mice, however, NK1+ CD3+ cells appear transiently but disappear in favor of CD4+ and CD8+ cells that proliferate in response to an allogeneic marrow graft. The CD8+ cells express cytolytic activity with specificity similar to that of the acute rejection mechanism, consistent with the suggestion that TNK cells differentiate into CD8+ killer cells. The reason why TNK cells in nude mice fail to differentiate into CD8+ CTL is explained by the lack of Th cells.
