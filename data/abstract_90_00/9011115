Recently, the increase in the number of resistant strains of Campylobacter jejuni to fluoroquinolone has been reported in European countries. We also studied antimicrobial susceptibilities of 600 clinical isolates of Campylobacter jejuni isolated during a 6 year period from 1989 through 1994 in four Tokyo Metropolitan Hospitals. The susceptibility to 6 antimicrobial agents, norfloxacin (NFLX), ofloxacin (OFLX), ciprofloxacin (CPFX), nalidixic acid (NA), erythromycin (EM) and tetracycline (TC) were examined. The overall resistant rates were as follows: NFLX, 45 strains (7.5%); OFLX, 45 strains (7.5%); CPFX, 44 strains (7.3%); NA, 62 strains (10.3%); EM, 4 strains (0.6%) and TC, 259 strains (43.2%). The number of resistant strains to fluoroquinolones and NA has increased significantly since 1993 in Japan, but the susceptibility to erythromycin has still remained the same level during the past 6 years. The susceptibility to TC was variable, and MICs gave a bimobal distribution, as pointed out previously. The resistance pattern of NFLX, OFLX, CPFX and NA were observed most frequently in those isolates.
