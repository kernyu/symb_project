In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, heat shock treatment provides protection against subsequent hydrostatic pressure damage. Such an induced hydrostatic pressure resistance (barotolerance) closely resembles the thermotolerance similarly induced by heat shock treatment. The parallel induction of barotolerance and thermotolerance by heat shock suggests that hydrostatic pressure and high temperature effects in yeast may be tightly linked physiologically.
