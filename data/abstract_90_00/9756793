Insertion sequence IS18 was detected by analysis of the spontaneous aminoglycoside resistant mutant Acinetobacter sp. 13 strain BM2716-1. Insertion of the element upstream from the silent acetyltransferase gene aac(6')-Ij created a hybrid promoter that putatively accounts for the expression of the aminoglycoside resistance gene. The 1, 074-bp IS18 element contained partially matched (20 out of 26 bases) terminal inverted repeats, one of which overlapped the 3' end of a 935-bp open reading frame potentially encoding a protein related to the transposases of the IS30 family. IS18 was found in 6 out of 29 strains of Acinetobacter sp. 13 but not in 10 strains each of A. baumannii and A. haemolyticus.
