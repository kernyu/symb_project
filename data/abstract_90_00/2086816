A new oral cephem, cefdinir (CFDN) was evaluated for its efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics in 13 children. The results are summarized as follows. Plasma concentration peaked at 3-4 hours after administration of 3 mg/kg of CFDN with Cmax ranging from 0.57-0.89 microgram/ml except 1 case in which the absorption of the drug was poor. Recovery rates in urine averaged at 13.4%, with a large individual variation. Ten children with 12 bacterial infections were treated with 9 mg/kg/day of CFDN fine granule. Clinical responses were good in 10 patients and fair in 1 patient, with an efficacy rate of 90.9%. No clinical adverse reactions nor abnormal laboratory findings were encountered.
