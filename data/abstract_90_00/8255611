HTM agar was used for in vitro study for antibiotics activity (other than beta-lactams) on H. influenzae. Tested strains belong to various phenotypes. The zone-size breakpoints were determined according to breakpoints concentrations, distribution of bacterial populations and mechanism of resistance. The following zone-size breakpoints could be suggested: chloramphenicol (30 micrograms) > or = 28 and < 24 mm; kanamycin (30 UI) > or = 18 and < 15 mm; gentamicin (10 UI) > or = 16 and < 14 mm; tetracycline (30 UI) > or = 23 and < 18 mm; doxycycline (30 UI) > or = 20 and < 14 mm; minocycline (30 UI) > or = 20 mm; rifampicin (30 micrograms) > or = 24 and < 20 mm; pristinamycin (15 micrograms) > or = 20 mm; erythromycin (15 UI) > or = 22 and < 18 mm; ciprofloxacin (5 micrograms) > or = 30 mm; trimethoprim and co-trimoxazole > or = 24 and < 20 mm.
