Adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) is derived from CD4+ T cells and has a poor prognosis because of its resistance to chemotherapy. To evaluate the effectiveness of gene therapy for ATL, the effect of ganciclovir on ATL cell lines transfected with the thymidine kinase gene of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-TK) was analyzed. To transfer the HSV-TK gene to ATL cells, a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) vector that has specific infectivity to CD4+ cells was used. HSV-TK was inserted into the long terminal repeats of HIV-1 and driven by the SL3 promoter HXBSL3TK. HXBSL3TK was co-transfected with HXBCAT as a reporter into MT2 or HUT102 cells by DEAE-dextran. The cells were incubated with ganciclovir, and chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) activity was analyzed. The CAT activity of the MT2 cells and HUT102 cells transfected with HXBSL3TK decreased dose-dependently with ganciclovir. HXBSL3TK was also co-transfected into COS cells with an HIV-1 packaging vector that has gag, pol, and env driven by a cytomegalovirus promoter. The supernatant was transferred to MT2 cells or Raji cells and incubated with ganciclovir. Ninety percent of the MT2 cells transduced by HXBSL3TK and incubated with ganciclovir were killed, but Raji cells were not killed. In addition, HXBTK that expresses the HSV-TK gene and Tat gene driven by the LTR of HIV-1 was constructed. HXBTK had a higher expression of the HSV-TK gene and higher sensitivity to ganciclovir than did HXBSL3TK.
