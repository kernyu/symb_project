With the recent observations of efflux of chloroquine from Plasmodium falciparum and modulation of chloroquine resistance by calcium channel blockers, such as verapamil, a great deal of attention has been focused on the development of new modulators that can potentiate the efficacy of chloroquine. We report a new compound, WR268954, that has weak intrinsic antimalarial activity compared to chloroquine. In vitro, it increased the susceptibilities of chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum strains to chloroquine and quinine, but did not affect the chloroquine-susceptible strains. In the presence of 2,000 nM of WR268954, the 50% inhibitory concentration of chloroquine for drug-resistant P. falciparum decreased 90-fold in comparison with the control (chloroquine only). The same concentration of WR268954 increased the potentiation of chloroquine in resistant strains to a level approximately equivalent to that observed for the sensitive strain. This compound also potentiates the efficacy of quinine in drug-resistant parasites. However, WR268954 did not enhance the efficacy of mefloquine in the mefloquine-resistant parasites. In this report, the data show the synergistic effect of WR268954 on the antimalarial activity of chloroquine in drug-resistant strains of P. falciparum, but only an additive effect on drug-sensitive strains of parasites. Compound WR268954 belongs to a pyrrolidino alkane amine class whose in vitro chloroquine resistance modulator activity supports the basis for the synthesis of this class of compounds.
