In vitro drug sensitivity of clinically isolated bacteria against prulifloxacin (PUFX), which is a new quinolone, was investigated, and the antibacterial activity and susceptibility rate at clinical breakpoint were compared with those of norfloxacin, ofloxacin (OFLX), ciprofloxacin, tosufloxacin, fleroxacin, sparfloxacin and levofloxacin (LVFX). The following results were obtained. 1) PUFX showed a broad-spectrum antibacterial activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. 2) MIC80 of PUFX was 0.25 and 1 microgram/ml, against methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae, respectively and below 0.125 microgram/ml against Gram-negative Enterobacteriaceae. MIC90 of PUFX against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which has MIC not exceeding 4 micrograms/ml to OFLX, was 0.5 microgram/ml. 3) PUFX was judged as active against the bacteria under the criteria proposed presented by "the Sensitivity Determination Committee for Antibiotics, Japan Society of Chemotherapy: Break Point for Respiratory Infectious Diseases and Sepsis". It is suggested that the sensitivity of each bacterial species to PUFX was high. 4) From the correlation analysis of MIC, PUFX was shown to have two to eight times higher antibacterial acitivity than LVFX for Citrobacter freundii, Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. 5) PUFX showed potent short-time bactericidal activity against S. aureus and P. aeruginosa.
