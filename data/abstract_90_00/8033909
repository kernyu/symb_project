In this study, we have surveyed gp63 expression in sinefungin-(SF)-resistant and wild-type Leishmania promastigotes. Documentation of gp63 expression in Leishmania promastigotes was carried out by Western blotting, purification of the protein and assessment of gp63 protease activity. We demonstrated a 3-4-fold and 1.5-2-fold increase of gp63 protein in SF-resistant Leishmania donovani and Leishmania tropica promastigotes compared to wild-type, respectively. Northern blot analysis showed that the increase in the amount of gp63 protein in SF-resistant compared to wild-type parasites was concomitant with an increase in gp63 mRNA. No extrachromosomal DNA was identified by alkaline lysis of isolated DNA samples and Southern blot analysis. Treatment of SF-resistant and wild-type L. donovani promastigotes with cycloheximide resulted in an increase of the steady state levels of gp63 mRNA in the SF-resistant parasites to approximately fivefold that of the wild type. After treating parasites with actinomycin D, estimated gp63 mRNA t1/2 in the wild type was 40 min and increased to 83 min in SF-resistant promastigotes. Therefore, the overexpression of gp63 may be mediated, at least in part, by post-transcriptional stabilization of a gp63 transcript by a protein factor. Down regulation of the latter factor may account for the observed increase in gp63 expression in SF-resistant promastigotes. Attempts to correlate gp63 expression with promastigote virulence suggested that the observed increase in gp63 expression did not result in a significant change in the virulence of SF-resistant compared to wild-type L. donovani promastigotes.
