H. pylori causes inflammatory lesions of the stomach and duodenum. At the present time eradication is essentially recommended in case of gastric or duodenal ulcer. The choice of the appropriate drug depends on the characteristics of the H. pylori infection, the localization deep in the gastric mucosa, the physico-chemical properties of the gastric medium, especially the acidity which deactivates antibiotics, slow bacterial growth and the germ's sensitivity to antibiotics. Anti-infectious treatment is now based on a three-drug regimen combining an antisecretory drug (proton pump inhibitor or H2 receptor antagonist) and two antibiotics: clarithromycin associated with amoxicillin or an imidazol derivative (metronidazol or tinidazol) or tetracycline. Two antibiotics (clarithromycin, amoxicillin) as well as three anti-secretory agents (lansoprazole, omeprazole, ranitidine) have been authorized in France for three-drug regimens of 1 or 2 weeks leading to approximately 90% eradication. Special attention should be placed on the risk of resistance to antibiotics (macrolids and imidazol derivatives) and patient compliance required for successful eradication of H. pylori. Other therapeutic schemes are under assessment and a vaccine is being prepared. Eradication of H. pylori has totally changed the treatment of gastric and duodenal ulcers, eliminating the need for long-term treatment and avoiding complications.
