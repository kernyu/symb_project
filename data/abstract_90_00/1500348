Mersacidin is a new peptide antibiotic of the proposed lantibiotic family. It is active in vitro and in vivo against Gram-positive bacteria including the methicillin-resistant Staphylococci. Its in vitro activity is less than those of vancomycin and erythromycin but it shows much higher activity in the in vivo system than can be expected from the in vitro testing results. A water soluble potassium salt has been prepared which has an activity profile similar to that of mersacidin, but has better in vivo activity against Streptococcus pyogenes than the parent compound.
