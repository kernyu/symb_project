In a study to determine secondary resistance among Helicobacter pylori isolates, gastroenterologists from several German cities submitted over a 3-year period to centre A (Regensburg) or centre B (Freiburg) gastric biopsies from patients in whom one or more therapies to eradicate Helicobacter pylori had failed. Rates of resistance among the collections of 302 (centre A) and 252 (centre B) isolates were, respectively, as follows: to metronidazole, 75% and 66%; to clarithromycin, 58% and 49%; to amoxicillin, 0%; to ciprofloxacin, 9%; to doxycycline, 0%; and to rifampin, 0%. Resistance to clarithromycin was associated with metronidazole resistance in 89% and 85% of the isolates in centre A and centre B, respectively.
