The experience with the use of sulperazone (a combination of cefoperazone, a 3rd generation cephalosporin, and sulbactam, a beta-lactamase inhibitor, Pfizer, USA) in the treatment of 25 patients with burns and deep burns (1 to 85 and 1 to 70 per cent of the body surface affection respectively) is described. The drug showed high clinical efficacy in the treatment of the infected burn wounds and infectious complications of the burns. Excellent and good results of the treatment were stated in 84 per cent of the patients. The extended affections and wound dissemination by multicomponent associations of polyresistant microbial strains lowered the microbiological efficacy of the treatment which amounted to 58 per cent. Rapid development of resistance to the drug in staphylococci was noted. The tolerance of sulperazone was good. The side effects were observed only in 1 patient.
