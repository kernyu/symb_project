Recently the incidence of infectious diseases caused by penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (PRSP) is increasing. Patients with meningitis caused by PRSP have been reported with high mortality especially in the field of pediatrics, and it is crucial to treat with accurate and precise choice of antibiotics. We report the first adult case of bacterial meningitis caused by PRSP in Japan. A 32-year-old male without immunological abnormalities developed acute pneumococcal meningitis. Empiric therapy with ampicillin and cefotaxime was not effective and the S. pneumonia from CSF showed resistance to multiple antibiotics such as penicillin and cefotaxime. He was treated successfully with the combination of panipenem/betamipron, vancomycin, and chloramphenicol. We assume that panipenem/betamipron is recommended to be added to empiric therapy of bacterial meningitis, considering an increasing incidence of PRSP infection.
