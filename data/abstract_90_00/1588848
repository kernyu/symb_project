In this study mycologic and bacteriologic cultures were made in 100 patients who had chronic suppurative otitis media. We observed 58.8% pure, 35.3% mixed growth (more than one bacteria or bacteria and fungus) in the cultures. In pure cultures, we found mostly Proteus sp., S. aureus and Pseudomonas sp. respectively. In 134 bacteriologic cultures most frequently isolated bacteria was S. aureus (36.6%). In Sabouraud agar, we found mostly Aspergillus sp. and Candida sp. (28.6%). In antimicrobial sensitivity test, gram negatives were found to be sensitive mostly to ofloxacin (73.5%), pseudomonas was found to be sensitive mostly to tobramycin (70%). In the staphylococci the antimicrobic which had the highest sensitivity rate was gentamicin (75.5%), but at the same time we observed 24.5% resistance to this antimicrobic agent. Following this respectively, ofloxacin 71.4% sensitivity 4.1% resistance, cefuroxime 69.4% sensitivity 10.2% resistance rate were detected.
