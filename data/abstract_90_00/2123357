An increase in the number of patients attending the Victoria Infirmary, Glasgow with isoniazid resistant tuberculosis, prompted a survey of the incidence of the condition in Glasgow. There was a clustering of cases among the homeless and/or alcoholic population of the city, particularly between the years 1982 and 1986. This suggests an outbreak of isoniazid resistance among that population, probably spread from a single, but unidentified source.
