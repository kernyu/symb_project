A 58-year-old male was referred to our division because of antibiotic-resistant pneumonia. A chest X-ray film revealed severe pneumonia over the left lung field but laboratory data showed no leukocytosis. Transbronchial lung biopsy findings showed the evidence consistent with organizing pneumonia. One-month prednisolone therapy produced a disappearance of the pneumonia shadow, but a giant bulla was found at the same site. It was considered that it was necessary to treat this case with a combination of effective antibiotics and steroids in the early phase of the disease.
