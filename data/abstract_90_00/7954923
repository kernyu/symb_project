2-Fluoro- and 2-chloroneplanocin A's (2 and 3) were synthesized as an adenosine deaminase resistant-equivalent of neplanocin A, and evaluated for their antitumor and antiviral activities. Of these, 2 was completely resistant to adenosine deaminase and showed more significant antitumor and antiviral activities than neplanocin A.
