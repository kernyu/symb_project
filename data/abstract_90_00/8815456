Fifty five Haemophilus influenzae strains were studied to determine their resistance to different antimicrobial drugs. They were isolated in Habana City, Cuba, during June 1992 to May 1993, from invasive and non invasive infections. An agar dilution method, according to NCCLS guidelines, was employed. We observed that 49%, 47.3% and 27.3% were resistant to ampicillin, tetracycline and chloramphenicol, respectively. beta-lactamase production was demonstrated in 22 strains (40%). There was neither resistance to ceftriaxone, cefotaxime nor rifampicin. 36.4% of the strains were multiresistant, being described 7 different resistance patterns. The rate of resistance to the drugs was substantially higher among serotype b than among non type b strains.
