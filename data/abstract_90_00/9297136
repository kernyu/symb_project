Minimal change nephrotic syndrome (MCNS) is the most frequent single cause of nephrotic syndrome occurring both in adults and children. Although it appears to be a self-limiting disorder (10% spontaneous remissions within the fortnight following the initial flare), MCNS displays a high rate of complications during the nephrotic period (10 to 15% cases) and prompts one to treat patients as early as possible. Corticosteroids are currently used as first-line treatment. A 16 weeks full-dose steroid course (1 mg/kg/day) usually induces remission in 75% MCNS in adults. Nevertheless, duration of treatment (9 months) and occurrence of relapses despite a slowly tapering dosage schedule, expose patients to steroids side-effects. Immunosuppressive drugs are recommended in case of steroid resistance and their side-effects are not harmless. Therefore, an alternative to steroids or immunosuppressives would lend a serious helping hand in MCNS management. The present work is dealing with pefloxacin efficacy in 40% MCNS in adults. Thirty-two MCNS adult patients were treated in a national multicenter study. A short-duration pefloxacin course (4 to 6 weeks) allowed partial or complete remission in 13 out of 32 cases. Thus far, this effect was undescribed for this class of drugs. Pefloxacin belongs to antibacterial agents of the fluoroquinolone family and is active against Gram negative Enterobacteria species. Fluoroquinolones also act on eukaryotic cells as lymphocytes and chondrocytes and alter IL2, gamma IFN and integrin expression. Although their precise mode of action is unknown in this kind of immunological disorder, fluoroquinolones might represent an alternative to steroids in some adult form of MCNS. However, predictive criteria for sensitivity to fluoroquinolones are currently not available and further controlled studies would be helpful using fluoroquinolones as first-line treatment in all the MCNS.
