The semiautomated fluorometric microculture cytotoxicity assay (FMCA), based on the measurement of fluorescence generated from cellular hydrolysis of fluorescein diacetate (FDA) to fluorescein in microtiter plates, was used for in vitro evaluation of Cladribine (2-chlorodeoxyadenosine, CdA) interactions with five standard antileukemic drugs: amsacrine (Am), etoposide (VP16), daunorubicin (Dnr), cytosine arabinoside (AraC), and mitoxantrone (Mit). Samples from 31 patients with acute myelocytic leukemia (AML) were tested with continuous drug exposure. A large heterogeneity with respect to cell kill was observed for all combinations tested. An additive model provided a significantly better fit of the data compared to the effect of the most active single agent of the combination (Dmax) only for CdA+AraC. When the frequency of additive and synergistic interactions were calculated according to the multiplicative concept for drug interactions, the highest frequencies were observed for CdA+AraC and CdA+Dnr. This interaction pattern was confirmed by isobologram analysis. Cross-resistance analysis revealed high correlations between CdA and AraC whereas the correlations were weaker between CdA and the other drugs. The highest frequency of synergistic interactions was obtained for AraC+CdA, despite their cross-resistance. Of the non-cross-resistant drugs tested, Dnr appears to be the most effective adjunct to CdA in terms of interactions at the cellular level.
