Plasmodium falciparum malaria is infrequently recognized in Israel as a cause of infection during pregnancy. We expect that with increasing frequency physicians in Israel will confront patients with malaria. Special concern should be given to malaria in pregnancy because of its serious complications. Thus, prompt diagnosis and treatment are essential. While chloroquine is safe for use in pregnancy, drug resistance is common, especially with Plasmodium falciparum. There is concern about the safety of other antimalarial agents during pregnancy. We recently observed a case of chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium falciparum malaria during pregnancy in a new immigrant primigravida from Ethiopia. Malaria in patients from endemic regions is less severe than in nonimmune hosts. Therefore, we elected to follow the patient's parasitemia periodically without additional antimalarial treatment until after delivery.
