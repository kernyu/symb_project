Glucose-starved cells of Vibrio parahaemolyticus were compared with non-starved counterparts with respects to heat, osmotic, and oxidative challenges. The starved cells demonstrated greater thermal and oxidative resistance than did the non-starved cells. The starved cells also showed greater resistance against low osmotic challenge than did the non-starved cells although both cells showed a comparable resistance against high osmotic challenge.
