In a period of nine months (May 1991 to January 1992), 39 infants were colonized with Acinetobacter baumannii in a paediatric intensive care unit. Colonization was observed mainly in premature infants, weighing between 680 g and 2,000 g, who were artificially ventilated. Shortly after birth, A. baumannii was isolated regularly from tracheal washings, and less frequently from other material, such as gastric juice, catheter tips, and umbilical swabs. In older children or adults, the bacteria were found only in very low frequency. In the intensive care unit, A. baumannii could be isolated from tap water, sinks, water traps of the ventilation devices, the inner wall of incubators, and from the hands of medical personnel. Patients strains of A. baumannii, and those isolated monitoring the intensive care unit had an identical biochemical profile and a similar pattern of antimicrobial resistance, as well as a similar reaction in other typing methods. Anti-infective measures are discussed.
