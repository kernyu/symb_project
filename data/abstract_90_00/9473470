Retroviral gene transfer of dominant selectable markers into hematopoietic cells can be used to select genetically modified cells in vivo or to attenuate the toxic effects of chemotherapeutic agents. We show that retroviral gene transfer of thymidylate synthase (TS) confers resistance to TS directed anticancer agents and that co-expression of TS and dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) confers resistance to TS and DHFR cytotoxic agents. Retroviral vectors encoding Escherichia coli TS, human TS, and the Tyr-to-His at residue 33 variant of human TS (Y33HhTS) were constructed and fibroblasts transfected with these vectors conferred comparable resistance to the TS-directed agent fluorodeoxyuridine (FdUrd, approximately 4-fold). Retroviral vectors that encode dual expression of Y33HhTS and the human L22Y DHFR (L22YhDHFR) variants conferred resistance to FdUrd (3- to 5-fold) and trimetrexate (30- to 140-fold). A L22YhDHFR-Y33HhTS chimeric retroviral vector was also constructed and transduced cells were resistant to FdUrd (3-fold), AG337 (3-fold), trimetrexate (100-fold) and methotrexate (5-fold). These results show that recombinant retroviruses can be used to transfer the cDNA that encodes both TS and DHFR and dual expression in transduced cells is sufficiently high to confer resistance to TS and DHFR directed anticancer agents.
