Interleukin-12 (IL-12)-deficient mice derived from a strain genetically resistant to infection with Leishmania major were recently shown to be susceptible toward this parasite, developing a strong Th2 response after injection of a large number of parasites. We further investigated the role of IL-12 in L. major infection by studying the responses of mutant mice against smaller numbers of parasites. IL-12-deficient mice infected with only small numbers of parasites showed the progressive lesion development and high parasite burden associated with a polarized Th2 response. Our data show that IL-12 is indispensable for protective immunity against L. major. Even at low inocula, no salvage pathway appears to compensate for the lack of IL-12. However, genetically susceptible BALB/c mice infected with small numbers of parasites were able to resolve lesions and restrict the parasite burden to levels which were 10(5)-fold lower than those in IL-12-deficient mice. In contrast to mutant mice, BALB/c mice mounted a type 1 response against low inocula of L. major. IL-12-deficient BALB/c mice, however, developed a type 2 response. These data emphasize the essential role of IL-12 in resistance against L. major. In addition, this study suggests that in the absence of IL-12, susceptibility to L. major is determined by the inability to induce a Th1 response rather than the development of a Th2 response. Our results are relevant for potential vaccination strategies that use low inocula of infective microorganisms which fail to induce a protective type 1 response at higher inocula.
