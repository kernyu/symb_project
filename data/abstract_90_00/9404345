OBJECTIVE: Determine the causes of malaria attacks in subjects who have returned from endemic areas by assessing prescriptions for chemical prophylaxis and compliance. PATIENTS AND METHODS: All patients who developed a paroxysmal episode of malaria diagnosed at the University of Nice hospital in 1995 answered specific questions concerning their anti-malaria prophylaxis. RESULTS: Thirty-three patients were hospitalized for paroxysmal episodes of malaria in 1995. In 32 cases (97%) the attack resulted from either the lack of any prophylaxis (17 cases, 52%), inadequate prescription (11 cases, 12%) or poor compliance (4 cases, 12%). The prescribed chemical prophylaxis was not adapted to the chloroquinone-resistant area in 8 cases (24%) and medical recommendations concerning administration rules were inadequate in 3 cases (9%). Only one patient developed a paroxysmal episode despite correct compliance to a chloroquine-resistant zone-adapted well-conducted prescription. The cost of poor prophylaxis in terms of human suffering and financial cost was high for this preventable disease. Four patients had to be hospitalized in the intensive care unit and one died during hospitalization. The cumulative cost of hospitalization for these 33 cases was evaluated at 660,000 FF. CONCLUSION: Preventive measures for malaria must include better information for physicians on changing recommendations for chemical prophylaxis as well as better information for travelers provided by all those involved in organizing travel to endemic areas.
