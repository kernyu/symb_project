Because it remained controversial, the use of selective digestive decontamination (SDD) in patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) was chosen as the topic of the first European Consensus Conference in Intensive Care Medicine (ECCICM) in December, 1991. The Consensus Bureau decided to assess the impact of this conference 2 years afterwards. For this purpose, a questionnaire was sent to the members of the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine, the Societe de Reanimation de Langue Francaise and the Societe Francaise d'Anesthesie et Reanimation before the conference. The recommendations following the conference discouraged the systematic use of SDD in ventilated patients and urged the monitoring of bacterial resistance and adapting antibiotics to epidemiology of the units. Two years after the conference, the same questionnaire was sent to those physicians who had responded to the first one. Eighteen percent used SDD for all ventilated patients and 17% remain users after 2 years. Among the occasional (32%) or continual (17%) users of SDD, the regimens used were mostly intravenous cefotaxime (60% of systemic antibiotics) and a topical combination of polymixin E, tobramycin, and amphotericin B (62% of overall topical combinations). The antibiotics used were unchanged after 2 years in almost all cases. In conclusion, the short-term impact of the Consensus Conference on SDD in ICU patients has been poor. This may be related to the continuing insufficiency of strong, definite data regarding the impact of this technique upon mortality and the theoretical risk of resistance to antibiotics, thus allowing physicians to stick to their policies until there is new evidence.
