In 12 patients (26%) no bacteria where found in any of the blood culture systems inoculated with blood taken 2-5 minutes after extraction. In the blood from 20 patients however, bot Oxoid and Bio-Merieux (aerobic/anaerobic) cultures proved positive, while in 13 cases only Bio-Merieux and in 2 cases only Oxoid cultures showed bacterial growth. Positive cultures were found only in patients who displayed poor or moderate oral hygiene. The strains most often isolated were Gram-positive; aerobic facultative and obligate anaerobic bacteria were found with similar frequency. Most bacteria proved sensitive to Amoxicillin, while 25% of the isolated bacteria were resistant to Penicillin-G, and 6% of them to cefuroxime and cefaclor.
