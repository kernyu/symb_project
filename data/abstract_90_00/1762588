260 beta hemolytic streptococci were isolated from clinical specimens sent to Microbiology Laboratory, Faculty of Medicine, Anadolu University between September 1988 - September 1989. They were grouped according to their sensitivity to bacitracin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (SXT) and also serologically. Of 260 isolates, 83.8% were group A, 1.2% group B, 6.5% group C, 3.5% group D and 5% were group G. All of 121 group A isolates confirmed serologically were susceptible to bacitracin. Excluded 9 strains, all of them were resistant to SXT. Other groups were mostly resistant to bacitracin. While group C and G generally were susceptible to SXT, B and D were resistant. Streptococci were documented according to distribution of clinical specimens. From throat 191 group A, 16 group C, 1 group D and 11 group G; from nose 7 group A; from pus 19 group A, 4 group D and 1 group G; from vagina 1 group A, 3 group B, 2 group D and 1 group G; from urine 2 group D; from blood 1 group C were isolated. All isolates were tested for penicillin G sensitivity by Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method. While one of three group B strains and four of eight group D strains were resistant to penicillin G, all the other isolates were susceptible to penicillin G.
