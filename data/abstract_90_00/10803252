Despite low virulence of enterococci, they have become important nosocomial pathogens. This has been correlated with the increased use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, particularly cephalosporins. Many strains of enterococci exhibit multiple drug resistance; the most important being high-level resistance (HLR) to penicillin (MIC > 100 mg/l) and gentamicin (MIC > 500 mg/l and 2000 mg/l) and/or streptomycin (MIC > 2000 mg/l). The investigation was performed on 92 strains, isolated from genito-urinary tract and recognised as Enterococcus sp. All strains were obtained from several microbiological laboratories of Gdansk, Gdynia and Tczew. On biochemical reaction profiles species of enterococci were identified as: E. faecalis (72.8%), E. faecalis varians (9.8%), E. durans (7.6%) and E. faecium (9.8%). The minimal inhibitory concentration (MICs) of penicillin, ampicillin, azlocillin, imipenem, gentamicin, amicacin, ciprofioxacin and vancomycin were determined by the agar dilution method. None of these 92 enterococcal strains was vancomycin resistant. 22.2% of E. faecium and 7.5% of E. faecalis showed high-level resistance to penicillin. None of these strains were produced beta-lactamase. High-level resistance to streptomycin and gentamicin was detected. Both--high-level resistance to streptomycin and gentamicin--were found in 6% E. faecalis; 11.1% E. faecalis varians and 22.2% E. faecium.
