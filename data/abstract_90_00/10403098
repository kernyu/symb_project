The antimicrobial susceptibility of 239 coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) isolates consecutively collected from blood culture in patients admitted in a 600-bed teaching hospital was evaluated. The isolates were identified to the species level by conventional methods and the MicroScan Positive Combo Panel type 6 system, and their susceptibility to vancomycin, teicoplanin, and oxacillin were tested by agar dilution, disk diffusion, and MicroScan-WalkAway system. The species distribution was as follows: Staphylococcus epidermidis 120 (50.2%), S. hominis 29 (12.1%), S. haemolyticus 24 (10.0%), S. cohnii 14 (5.9%), and isolates from other CNS species 52 (21.8%). The percentage of resistance to oxacillin was 74.5% by agar dilution. The highest percentages of oxacillin resistance were found among S. haemolyticus (95.8%) and S. epidermidis (80.8%). Teicoplanin resistance (MIC > or = 32 micrograms/mL) was detected in five S. haemolyticus isolates, whereas intermediate resistance (MIC = 16 micrograms/mL) was detected in nine strains. These isolates with reduced susceptibility to teicoplanin were resistant to oxacillin, but remained susceptible to vancomycin (MIC < or = 4 micrograms/mL). Two isolates, one S. haemolyticus and one S. epidermidis, showed a vancomycin MIC of 8 micrograms/mL, and both MicroScan and disk diffusion methods classified these isolates as susceptible. Our results showed that glycopeptide resistance is emerging among CNS isolates in our institution and the disk diffusion method may not detect isolates with decreased susceptibility to these antimicrobial agents.
