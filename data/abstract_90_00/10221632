The ability of lactating Romney ewes to resist establishment of ingested infective-stage larvae (L3) of Ostertagia circumcincta and Trichostrongylus colubriformis was measured in the field. Three groups of seven single-lamb-bearing ewes were selected on the basis of uniformity of lambing date from a large flock held on pasture. Either 2, 4 or 6 weeks after parturition, groups of ewes were dosed with 24000 L3 of known oxfendazole-resistant parasite strains; 12000 of each species. Ten to 14 days later the ewes, along with their lambs, were transferred from the field to indoor pens. Twenty-five days after the challenge dose the ewes were drenched with oxfendazole to remove any field-derived infection and 3 days later slaughtered for worm counts. Mean establishment of the resistant parasites was low at all times, with the highest rate recorded being 6.1% for O. circumcincta 2 weeks after parturition. Establishment of O. circumcincta 4 and 6 weeks after parturition, and of T. colubriformis at all times, never exceeded 2%. By comparison, mean establishment in lambs held indoors and parasite free for 13 weeks prior to infection, was 24.9% and 47.1% for O. circumcincta and T. colubriformis, respectively. These results indicate that the lactating ewes were exhibiting a substantial ability to prevent establishment of ingested larvae. The results of this and other similar studies suggest that the dynamics of parasitism in lactating Coopworth and Romney ewes in New Zealand is substantially different to that in Merino ewes in Australia, and that these differences influence optimal strategies for the management of anthelmintic resistance in the two countries.
