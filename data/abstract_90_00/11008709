Severe mycotic infections are a source of concern in immunocompromised patients or in those who receive chemotherapy for hematological malignant diseases. One of the causes is referred to the appearance of antimycotic resistant microorganisms. Fluconazole is one of the antimycotic used for invasive mycoses treatment. Therefore it is necessary to evaluate the factors that originate this resistance. In the present report the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae S288c was used as a model system. In resistant strains the accumulation of the lipophilic cation Rhodamine 6G, L-leucine uptake and growth inhibition by crystal violet dye were determined. The results presented herein demonstrate the correlation between the membrane potential and the resistance to fluconazole presented by S. cerevisiae strain S288c.
