The development of antimicrobial resistance in main pathogens of respiratory system infections (S. pneumoniae, H. Influenzae, B. catarrhalis) reduces the range of unprotected penicillins indications. The inhibitors of beta-lactamase rendered back the original spectrum of antimicrobial activity to aminopenicillins and ureidopenicillins, and withheld them within the most frequently used armamentarium of antimicrobial drugs for the therapy of more severe infections. The prescription of penicillins is ruled according to the localization of infection, most frequent pathogens and by the epidemiologic situation. A combined antibiotic therapy is indicated in severe infections. An important indication area is the prophylactic administration of penicillins in recurring tonsilopharyngitis, recurring otitis media and eradication of meningococcal carriership. (Tab. 1, Ref. 3.).
