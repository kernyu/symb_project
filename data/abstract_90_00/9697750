The origin of high-level vancomycin resistance in enterococci is unknown. Biopesticidal powders containing spores of Bacillus popilliae, which is vancomycin-resistant, have been used for >50 years in the United States for suppression of Japanese beetle populations. Using a polymerase chain reaction assay designed to amplify the vanB gene in enterococci, an amplicon in B. popilliae was identified and sequenced. The putative ligase gene in B. popilliae had 76.8% and 68.4%-68.9% nucleotide identity to the sequences of the vanA and vanB genes, respectively. There was 75.3% and 69.3%-69.9% identity between the translation of the putative ligase gene in B. popilliae and the translation of the vanA and vanB genes, respectively. We have identified a gene resembling vanA and vanB in B. popilliae. The gene in B. popilliae may have been a precursor to or have had an ancestral gene in common with vancomycin resistance genes in enterococci.
