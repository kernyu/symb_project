Using 9 strains of Candida albicans mutants resistant to either a triazole-antifungal vibunazole, an imidazole-antifungal ketoconazole or a morpholine-antifungal amorolfine, experiments were conducted to see whether cross-resistance was developed to any of these 3 different families, as well as to an allylamine-antifungal terbinafine. All four compounds are known to selectively inhibit fungal ergosterol biosynthesis. All the mutant strains were found to be more or less resistant to other families of ergosterol biosynthesis inhibitors but not to terbinafine.
