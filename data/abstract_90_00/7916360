An outbreak of Staphylococcus aureus infections occurred following discontinuation of antiseptic cord care on a neonatal unit. Multiple phage types were involved. The most common site of infection was the umbilicus. In addition, there were two clusters of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) infection and one due to Streptococcus pyogenes. The outbreak was rapidly controlled by the reintroduction of hexachlorophane powder for cord care.
