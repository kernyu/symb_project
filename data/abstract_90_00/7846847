This paper surveys models of nematode parasites of veterinary importance. A distinction is drawn between generic models which are usually simple formulations applicable to whole classes of parasite and specific models which are often more complex and designed to address questions concerning a particular species. Most of the models considered employ a deterministic framework. Four main groups are considered: generic models of trichostrongylid infection of domestic ruminants, specific models of trichostrongylid infection of domestic ruminants, specific models of experimental laboratory infections of rodents, and a specific model of nematode infections in wildlife.
