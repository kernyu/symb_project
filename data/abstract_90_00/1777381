A large majority (87.4%) of 190 Staphylococcus aureus isolates from fresh beef in Lubumbashi (Zaire) belonged to the human St. aureus ecovar; 81.2% of the phage-typed human strains were partially or solely lysed by phages of group III. Thirteen of the 52 tested strains (25.0%) were enterotoxin producers; nine of these (69.2%) were positive for staphylococcal enterotoxin A. Sixteen serotypes were identified among the 122 Salmonella isolates and nearly all these strains were susceptible to the 8 different antibiotics tested.
