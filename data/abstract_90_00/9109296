BACKGROUND: Because of increased bacterial resistance and the addition of new antimicrobial medications, the current and appropriate treatment of ocular bacterial infections is an important issue for eye care practitioners. METHODS: The literature on the antimicrobial treatment of ocular bacterial infections is reviewed to provide the practicing optometrist with an overview of the issues and medications involved in therapy. RESULTS: New topical, oral, and parenteral antibiotic medications continuously become available to eye care practitioners. Clinicians must routinely reassess the conventional antimicrobial therapy in light of the drugs available for the treatment of bacterial eye infections. The clinician must be familiar with distinct protocols and medications for the management of different ocular bacterial infections. CONCLUSIONS: Knowledge of the results of controlled antimicrobial studies and a review of standard practices in managing bacterial eye disease can provide the necessary background to help the eye care clinician make appropriate antimicrobial therapeutic decisions in patient care.
