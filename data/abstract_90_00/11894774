The resting potentials of the marginal cells in the stria vascularis of the guinea pig were determined from changes in the combined electrode-tissue resistance of the electrode. The resistance of the electrode was 45.5 +/- 16.0 M omega (n = 20) before penetration of the stria vascularis and 46.7 +/- 17.3 M omega (n = 20) after penetration. The resistance drops across the luminal membrane of the marginal cells were 46.0 +/- 22.6 M omega (n = 12) in kanamycin-deafened guinea pigs and 54.5 +/- 33.1 M omega (n = 9) in normal guinea pigs. The endocochlear potential (EP) and resting potentials in the marginal cells were 90.1 +/- 6.0 mV (n = 14) and 70.4 +/- 11.3 mV (n = 14) in kanamycin-deafened guinea pigs and 84.8 + 5.1 mV (n = 29) and 74.7 +/- 11.7 mV (n = 29) in normal guinea pigs. The resting potentials in the marginal cells decreased gradually and were approximately 0 mV around 20 min after anoxia in both kanamycin-deafened and normal guinea pigs. These changes were comparable to those of EP in kanamycin-deafened guinea pigs during anoxia. The mechanism of the EP in kanamycin-deafened guinea pigs is discussed.
