Chloramphenicol was used to treat confirmed typhoid fever in 50 patients, but 14 patients did not respond to treatment. When their treatment was changed to ofloxacin (400 mg twice daily for six days, followed by 200 mg for eight days, administered orally), all responded. Ofloxacin was well tolerated and appears to be an effective agent in the treatment of typhoid fever.
