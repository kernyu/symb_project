Actinomadura madurae is an aerobic actinomycete which is best known worldwide as the cause of actinomycotic mycetomas. It has not previously been reported to have caused invasive pulmonary or disseminated infection in humans. We describe an AIDS patient with opportunistic A. madurae-induced pneumonia and bacteremia. The isolate from the patient's blood was subjected to dilutional antimicrobial susceptibility tests with 12 antimicrobial agents and was found to have a wide spectrum of susceptibility. This unusual microorganism may be a cause of infections in severely immunosuppressed patients.
