The impact of emergence of genetic resistance, soon after the beginning of antiretroviral therapy, on the genotype of other viral loci not implicated in the development of resistance was studied in four human immunodeficiency type 1 (HIV-1)-infected patients subjected to indinavir monotherapy. Two patients were chosen because they showed no decrease in virus load during the study period and two were selected because they showed a rapid decline in plasma viraemia after the initiation of therapy and a virus rebound after 12 weeks of treatment. The evolution of virus sequences was analysed within the four infected patients by examining virus sequences spanning the protease and C2-V3 env genes by RT-PCR of plasma samples obtained at the beginning and after 12 weeks of therapy. PCR products from the two genomic regions from the two sample points per patient were cloned and 10-15 clones from each sample were sequenced. Genotypic indinavir resistance was present in the four patients after 12 weeks of therapy. The overall protease and C2-V3 env regions quasispecies diversity at time zero was higher than that after 12 weeks of therapy, but this difference was more significant in the two patients who showed a reduction in virus load soon after the initiation of treatment. C2-V3 env sequences indicated that changes during emergence of resistance to indinavir were only detected in the two patients who showed a drastic reduction in virus load. Thus, a temporal relationship was observed between the start of therapy, a drastic reduction in virus load and a drift in the HIV-1 env quasispecies.
