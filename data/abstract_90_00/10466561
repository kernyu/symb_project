A prospective study was undertaken to determine colonization rates, susceptibility profiles, and outcomes in patients with clinical isolates of Acinetobacter baumannii. Fifty percent of patients became colonized with A. baumannii, and 29% of these patients had clinical and colonizing isolates with discordant susceptibility profiles, without apparent relation to antibiotic use. Barrier infection control measures are necessary to prevent nosocomial transmission.
