We demonstrate a reliable method for mapping conventional loci and obtaining meiotic linkage data for the ciliated protozoan Tetrahymena thermophila. By coupling nullisomic deletion mapping with meiotic linkage mapping, loci known to be located on a particular chromosome or chromosome arm can be tested for recombination. This approach has been used to map three isozyme loci, EstA (Esterase A), EstB (Esterase B), and AcpA (Acid Phosphatase A), with respect to the ChxA locus (cycloheximide resistance) and 11 RAPDs (randomly amplified polymorphic DNAs). To assign isozyme loci to chromosomes, clones of inbred strains C3 or C2 were crossed to inbred strain B nullisomics. EstA, EstB and AcpA were mapped to chromosomes 1R, 3L and 3R, respectively. To test EstA and AcpA for linkage to known RAPD loci on their respective chromosomes, a panel of Round II (genomic exclusion) segregants from a B/C3 heterozygote was used. Using the MAPMAKER program, EstA was assigned to the ChxA linkage group on chromosome 1R, and a detailed map was constructed that includes 10 RAPDs. AcpA (on 3R), while unlinked to all the RAPDs assigned to chromosome 3 by nullisomic mapping, does show linkage to a RAPD not yet assignable to chromosomes by nullisomic mapping.
