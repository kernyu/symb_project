Traditionally, the discovery of pharmaceutical and agrochemical products has largely depended on mass screening. Over the years, screen design and screening programs have evolved in terms of the sensitivity with which active material can be identified, the number of samples that can be tested, and the types of molecular targets and cellular functions that can be conveniently assayed. More recently, screens with desirable properties have been developed for a great variety of molecular targets through the exploitation of Saccharomyces molecular biology and genetics. Recent advances have enabled researchers to develop yeast-based screens for agents acting on a number of new therapeutic targets: G-protein linked receptors, cytoplasmic receptors, ion (potassium) channels, novel fungal cell wall enzymes, fungal sterol biosynthesis enzymes, antiviral targets, immunosuppressive targets, cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase, oncogenes and the multiple drug resistance (MDR) protein.
