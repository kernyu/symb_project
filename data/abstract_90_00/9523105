During the past few years a wide spectrum of plant antimicrobial proteins has been detailed, and enhanced resistance has been obtained by introducing the corresponding genes into crop species to produce transgenic lines. With the aim of manipulating the plant signals that regulate an array of defense responses, the most intense research focuses on the avr-R-mediated recognition events and elucidation of the subsequent signaling pathways that govern the activation of genes encoding antimicrobial proteins.
