In vitro activity of ramoplanin, a cyclic lipoglycopeptide, against 92 vancomycin-resistant gram-positive organisms was evaluated. Ramoplanin demonstrated potent activity against many highly vancomycin-resistant organisms including enterococci (MICs for 90% of strains tested of 0.5 micrograms/ml) and against Lactobacillus spp., Leuconostoc spp., and Pediococcus spp., all of which were inhibited at concentrations of < or = 0.25 micrograms/ml. This drug or a derivative compound merits further investigation as a potential therapeutic agent for infections due to vancomycin-resistant enterococci.
