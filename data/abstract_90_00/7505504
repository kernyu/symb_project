Evidence is provided that selection of the Chinese hamster cells CHLV-79 RJK with ethidium bromide results in amplification and overexpression of mdr family genes, one of which is encoding a transmembrane P-glycoprotein reducing the intracellular drug concentration. It is likely that the amplified copies are located at or near the sites of resident mdr gene localization to look as an abnormal chromosomal banding pattern in chromosome 1q26. In the following selection steps to higher drug concentration, the cells are keeping the degree of amplification, but mdr gene expression increases by many times. The data suggest that the resistance of the Chinese hamster cells CHLV-79 RJK to higher concentrations of ethidium bromide may be achieved via a variety of mechanisms, including as well mdr gene amplification as transcriptional regulation of these genes.
