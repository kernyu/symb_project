In Nepal, drug sensitivity test for M. tuberculosis has been carrying out at the clinic of German-Nepal Tuberculosis Project (GENETUP) since 1986 and at National Tuberculosis Centre (NTC) since 1991. The studies of primary drug resistance and acquired drug resistance were performed at NTC. On the other hand, results of drug sensitivity test at GENETUP and NTC were compared and analyzed. In total, 160 M. tuberculosis strains which were isolated from new smear positive patients were studied for the primary drug resistance. One of 160 strains, 21 (13.1%) strains were resistant to one or more drugs. Resistance rate to one drug, two drugs and three drugs were 9.4%, 3.1% and 0.6% respectively. Resistance to four drugs and five drugs were not found. Prevalence of resistance of each drug were INH 8.1%, SM 5.0%, RFP 2.5%, EB 0.6% and Tb1 1.3% respectively. In total, 125 strains which were isolated from previously treated patients were studied for the acquired drug resistance. Out of 125 strains, 103 (82.4%) strains had resistance to one or more drugs. Resistance rate to one drug, two drugs, three drugs, four drugs and five drugs were 13.6%, 28.0%, 31.2%, 4.0% and 5.6% respectively. Resistance rate of each drug were INH 56.8%, SM 38.4%, RFP 71.2%, EB 16.8% and Tb1 24.0% respectively. Since media, criteria of resistance and definition of resistance for drug sensitivity test are different between GENETUP and NTC, it is difficult to compare the results. However, it is necessary to understand the differences well and get good agreement with both sides.
