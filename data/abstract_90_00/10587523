The regulation of epithelial Na(+)/H(+) exchangers (NHEs) by hyposmolality is poorly understood. In the renal medullary thick ascending limb (MTAL), transepithelial bicarbonate (HCO(3)(-)) absorption is mediated by apical membrane Na(+)/H(+) exchange, attributable to NHE3. In the present study we examined the effects of hyposmolality on apical Na(+)/H(+) exchange activity and HCO(3)(-) absorption in the MTAL of the rat. In MTAL perfused in vitro with 25 mM HCO(3)(-) solutions, decreasing osmolality in the lumen and bath by removal of either mannitol or sodium chloride significantly increased HCO(3)(-) absorption. The responses to lumen addition of the inhibitors ethylisopropyl amiloride, amiloride, or HOE 694 are consistent with hyposmotic stimulation of apical NHE3 activity and provide no evidence for a role for apical NHE2 in HCO(3)(-) absorption. Hyposmolality increased apical Na(+)/H(+) exchange activity over the pH(i) range 6.5-7.5 due to an increase in V(max). Pretreatment with either tyrosine kinase inhibitors or with the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor molybdate completely blocked stimulation of HCO(3)(-) absorption by hyposmolality. These results demonstrate that hyposmolality increases HCO(3)(-) absorption in the MTAL through a novel stimulation of apical membrane Na(+)/H(+) exchange and provide the first evidence that NHE3 is regulated by hyposmotic stress. Stimulation of apical Na(+)/H(+) exchange activity in renal cells by a decrease in osmolality may contribute to such pathophysiological processes as urine acidification by diuretics, diuretic resistance, and renal sodium retention in edematous states.
