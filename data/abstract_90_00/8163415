A 12-year-old neutered male domestic shorthair cat, being treated with methimazole for hyperthyroidism, developed chronic cholangitis with portal fibrosis and chronic cholecystitis. The common bile duct was not patent, which necessitated cholecystojejunostomy. Four days after surgery, the cat developed suppurative cholangio-hepatitis caused by a beta-lactam resistant Enterococcus. The cat's condition was further complicated by the concurrent development of hypokalemic polymyopathy. On the basis of minimum inhibitory concentrations, the Enterococcus was determined to be susceptible to vancomycin and resistant to numerous antibiotics commonly used for treatment of infections caused by Enterococcus spp. The cat recovered without evidence of adverse effects attributable to vancomycin.
