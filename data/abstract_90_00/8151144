The purpose of this report is to examine the effect of Macrolides (Erythromycin and Roxythromycin) on swarming ability and antistaphylococcal activity of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The standard strain (ATCC27854) and clinically isolated P. aeruginosa were used as test strains. The influence of Macrolides on antistaphylococcal activity and swarming ability were determined by the agar plate dilution method. The antistaphylococcal activity of P. aeruginosa was not affected at the concentration of 1.56 micrograms/ml of both Erythromycin and Roxythromycin. But the antistaphylococcal activity was not observed at the concentration over 100 micrograms/ml. The swarming ability was not affected at the concentration up to 12.5 micrograms/ml. It has been proved that Macrolides reveal inhibition of virulent factors of P. aeruginosa such as protease, elastase, piocianin and so on. Furthermore our data revealed that Macrolides inhibited swarming ability of P. aeruginosa, and did not affect the antistaphylococcal activity of P. aeruginosa under 1.56 micrograms/ml concentration. Consequently, these results suggest that Macrolides have exhibited a previously unknown pharmacological effect, and may be of interest in that there may be bacterial interaction between MRSA and P. aeruginosa.
