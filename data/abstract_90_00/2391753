Norfloxacin (NFLX, AM-715) is a new quinolone antibacterial agent. In the present study, we carried out laboratory and clinical investigations on NFLX in the field of pediatrics. The obtained results are summarized as follows. 1. NFLX was very active against Escherichia coli, Salmonella sp., Klebsiella sp., Enterobacter sp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa among Gram-negative rods. Antibacterial activities of NFLX against Gram-positive cocci were lower than those against Gram-negative rods but superior to activities of usual quinolone agents. MIC values of NFLX against Campylobacter jejuni were distributed in a range of less than or equal to 0.05-0.78 micrograms/ml. 2. A peak serum level of 0.49 micrograms/ml was observed in 2 subjects and its urinary recoveries were 13.7%, 21.5%, respectively. 3. Clinical efficacies to NFLX were excellent in 25 patients and good in 9 patients with a efficacy rate of 92%. In a bacteriological examination, causative organisms were eradicated with an eradication rate of 87%. 4. No side effects were observed except eosinophilia in 1 patient. These findings indicate that NFLX will be useful and safe drug against bacterial infections in pediatrics.
