Protoplasts of commercial strain No. 1 of Streptomyces roseolus producing lincomycin were prepared. Conditions for protoplast storage and regeneration were defined. The protoplasts of strain No. 1 mutants marked by the rifampicin and thiostrepton resistance and the ability to synthesize melanin pigments were fused. Genetic analysis of the recombinants was performed. Systems for transformation of S. roseolus protoplasts by plasmid DNAs were developed. Efficiency of transformation by pIJ702, pIJ61, pVG101 and pBG3 and stability of the transformants were shown.
