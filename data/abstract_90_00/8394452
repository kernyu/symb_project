We have previously shown that Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells are resistant to infection by gibbon ape leukemia virus and amphotropic pseudotype retroviral vectors because of the secretion of factors that inhibit retrovirus infection. Such factors were not secreted by any mouse or human cell lines tested. Secretion of the inhibitors and resistance to infection are abrogated by treatment of CHO cells with the glycosylation inhibitor tunicamycin. Here we show that the inhibitory activities against gibbon ape leukemia virus and amphotropic viruses are partially separable and that glycosylation mutations in CHO cells mimic the effects of tunicamycin treatment. We find that several hamster cell lines derived from both Chinese and Syrian hamsters secrete inhibitors of retrovirus infection, showing that these inhibitors are not unique to the CHO cell line. Inhibitory factors are also present in the sera of Chinese and Syrian hamsters but were not detected in bovine serum. These results suggest the presence of specific factors that function to inhibit retrovirus infection in hamsters.
