This study investigated travellers to tropical Africa with regard to prophylactic treatment of malaria. A total of 5703 travellers completed a questionnaire on their flights back to the Federal Republic of Germany; 4116 passengers (73.7%) had visited East Africa, while 808 (14.5%) had been to West Africa. The results indicate that 90.2% took a regular chemoprophylaxis against malaria. Nevertheless, 8.1% of the travellers used no antimalarials and in 9.3% chemoprophylaxis was inadequate due to inappropriate advice; for example, 7.5% still took pyrimethamine-sulfadoxine as prophylactic. Mefloquine was correctly taken by 38.9% of the travellers in East Africa; 12.6% used it in West Africa where it is not necessary. Antimosquito measures have a high priority for travellers to tropical Africa and dissemination of this fact must be improved since only 72.6% followed through on such advice.
