The microaerophilic protozoon Trichomonas vaginals responds to extracellular changes in oxygen concentration: acetate, lactate, ethanol, H2 and CO2 formation, as well as glucose-depletion rates, are affected. All these variables except ethanol production rates, also differed between clinically metronidazole-sensitive (1910) and resistant (IR78 and CDC85) strains. Most interesting were the greatly increased glucose-scavenging rates of resistant isolates and their low specific activities of hydrogenase and H2 formation rates by comparison with the metronidazole-sensitive strain. Results suggest that all three strains of this parasite are well adapted to the O2 levels prevailing in situ (13-56 microM). Thus, vaginal oxygen tensions have more pronounced effects on the balances of fermentation products in the resistant strains, and results indicate that these strains may then use hydrogenosomal pathways to their advantage.
