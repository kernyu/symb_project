The authors collect information on the biological properties, ecology and pathogenicity of Candida krusei. They give a list of forms of diseases caused by this yeast and a profile of its sensitivity to antimycotics. They point out the difference between C. krusei and species of C. albicans and analyze the factors enabling its propagation. In their opinion, the resistance of this yeast to fluconazole is the main cause of the increased number of colonizations and infections produced by C. krusei. The population of C. krusei resistant to fluconazole is selected from other, sensitive species of the genus Candida primarily in hospitalized patients. Though there is no consensus of opinion at present on the influence of fluconazole on the yeast spectrum, the authors suppose this systemic antimycotic plays a distinct role in the growing importance of C. krusei.
