Immunological indices for 121 pulmonary tuberculosis (PT) patients discharging drug-resistant M. tuberculosis were compared to those for 87 PT patients with M. tuberculosis sensitive to antibacterial drugs. The patients with drug-resistant bacteria before hospitalization had lower count of T-lymphocytes, altered proportion T-helpers/T-suppressors, reduced ability of T-lymphocytes for blast transformation in the presence of PHA and PPD. T-lymphocyte functional activity remained inhibited as compared to those patients discharging drug-sensitive mycobacteria.
