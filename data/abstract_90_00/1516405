Multidrug resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MDR-MTB) infection has not been recognized as a serious problem in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Multidrug resistance (MDR) has appeared in our medical center in 24 out of 72 patients between January 1990 and May 1991 compared to 8 out of 132 patients within the period from 1982 to 1987 (relative risk 5.50 with 95 percent confidence interval 2.61 to 11.61). We describe 19 patients with MDR in MTB (isoniazid and at least one additional first line drug), who had serologic evidence of HIV infection, 13 of whom were diagnosed with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). The MTB cultures from 10 out of 19 patients with MDR were resistant to three or more drugs. Fifteen patients died although 9 out of these 15 had received at least a four-drug regimen for a mean time of seven weeks (range 2 to 12). This increase in MDR was seen in ten homosexuals and nine intravenous drug users. This rapid appearance of MDR-MTB strains is worrisome. New strategies for empiric therapy of such patients while awaiting sensitivity data are needed.
