To select for Ds transposition in transgenic tomato plants a phenotypic excision assay, based on restoration of hygromycin phosphotransferase (HPT II) gene expression, was employed. Some tomato plants, however, expressed the marker gene even though the Ds had not excised. Read-out transcriptional activity of the Ds element is responsible for the expression of the HPT II gene. Transcription initiation was mapped to multiple positions spanning about 300 bp in the subterminal part of the Ds element. In this respect Ds in tomato resembles the maize element Mu1, which also promotes transcription outward from the element. Transposon read-out transcription might thus supply an additional general mechanism for controlling plant gene expression.
