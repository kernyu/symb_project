Multiple mutations in the reverse transcriptase (RT) gene were observed in a drug-resistant isolate of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV1) from an individual having prolonged (greater than 2 years) zidovudine (AZT) therapy. The virus replicated in PBMC's in the presence of very high concentrations of AZT (125 microM). Drug-sensitive strains were curtailed by 0.01 microM AZT. Eleven defined mutations were observed as compared with published sequences of RT for eight strains of HIV1. Eight of these mutations were found in the domain involved in nucleotide recognition and enzyme function. Only one of the mutations, giving a Thr--Tyr change at amino acid 215, matched those previously ascribed (67, 70, 215, and 219) to the generation of high-level resistance to AZT. Therefore additional amino acid changes may have significance in the emergence of super-resistant viruses.
