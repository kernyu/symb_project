Based on the dose-response dependence represented as a generating distribution function of infecting doses of a pathogen, a value for the epidemiological efficiency rate of preventive agents was derived. For an arbitrary distribution of infecting doses, EEC mean values is shown to always no greater than 1: ED50v/ED50w where ED50v and ED50w are 50% of the infective doses of the pathogen assessed for those treated with the agent and intact persons, respectively. This relation is also valid when differences in pathogenic resistance are determined not only due to the use of drugs, but for any other variables (age-, sex-specific and other factors). This was verified by experiments.
