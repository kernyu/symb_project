The higher levels of cytochrome P-450 dependent enzyme activities reported earlier are traced to higher levels of cytochrome P-450 (CYPIIB1/B2 like) messenger RNA in the chloroquine resistant than the sensitive strains. The messenger RNA is also induced by phenobarbitone in the sensitive strain. Pretreatment with phenobarbitone affords partial protection to chloroquine toxicity in the sensitive strain and this is not due to a differential accumulation of the drug.
