Historically, it has been theorized that the enhanced oxidant sensitivity of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD)-deficient erythrocytes arises as a direct consequence of an inability to maintain cellular glutathione (GSH) levels. This study alternatively hypothesizes that decreased NADPH concentration leads to impaired catalase activity which, in turn, underlies the observed oxidant susceptibility. To investigate this hypothesis, normal and G6PD-deficient erythrocytes and hemolysates were challenged with a H2O2-generating agent. The results of this study demonstrated that catalase activity was severely impaired upon H2O2 challenge in the G6PD-deficient cell while only a transient decrease was observed in normal cells. Supplementation of either normal or G6PD-deficient hemolysates with purified NADPH was found to significantly (P < 0.001) inhibit catalase inactivation upon oxidant challenge while addition of NADP+ had no effect. Analysis of these results demonstrated direct correlation between NADPH concentration and catalase activity (r = 0.881) and an inverse correlation between catalase activity and erythrocyte oxidant sensitivity (r = 0.906). In contrast, no correlation was found to exist between glutathione concentration (r = 0.170) and oxidant sensitivity. Analysis of NADPH/NADPt ratio in acatalasemic mouse erythrocytes demonstrated that NADPH maintenance alone was not sufficient to explain oxidant resistance, and that catalase activity was required. This study supports the hypothesis that impaired catalase activity underlies the enhanced oxidant sensitivity of G6PD-deficient erythrocytes and elucidates the importance of NADPH in the maintenance of normal catalase activity.
