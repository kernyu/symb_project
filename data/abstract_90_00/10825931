Isolation and propagation of a wild type phage, isolate AP-423, from an apparently lysogenic strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, resistant to a series of anti-pseudomonadal antibiotics, and its use for transduction of resistance determinants is described. The phage isolate AP-423 showed a phenomenon of host restriction, i.e. it was lysogenic only for some of the recipient strains tested. Its transduction capacity, both in sets of genes transduced and frequency of transduction, was different in two recipient strains of P. aeruginosa. This phage showed also some restriction in titers, to which it could be propagated, only in certain recipient strains.
