We performed basic and clinical studies in male gonococcal urethritis on a new oral antimicrobial agent, levofloxacin (LVFX, DR-3355), a new quinolone derivative. The antibacterial activity of LVFX against clinical strains of Neisseria gonorrhoeae was roughly comparable to that of ofloxacin, and ciprofloxacin. LVFX was administered to 10 males with gonococcal urethritis, 200 mg twice a day (8 cases) or 100 mg twice a day for 3 days (2 cases). Clinical evaluation was made according to the criteria of the Japanese UTI Committee. Overall efficacy rate was 100% (10/10). In the complication of chlamydia trachomatis (2 cases), efficacy rate was 100% (2/2). No subjective or objective adverse reactions occurred.
