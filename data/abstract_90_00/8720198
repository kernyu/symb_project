Scedosporium apiospermum, an anamorph of Pseudallescheria boydii, is a hyalohyphomycete which can be mistaken, histologically, for Aspergillus. S. apiospermum is clinically distinguished by resistance to most antifungals and its ability to cause invasive mycoses in immunocompetent patients. Here we present a typical case of lethal cerebral Pseudallescheria mycosis in a child after near-drowning.
