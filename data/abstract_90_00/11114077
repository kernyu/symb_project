The availability of potent combination antiretroviral therapy (ART), also known as highly active antiretroviral therapy or HAART has changed the prognosis of HIV infection. However, the benefits have to be seen in the context of deficiencies of current therapy: failure to eradicate the virus, the slow and potentially incomplete recovery of the immune system, the high prevalence of resistance, and the potential for long-term toxicity. Treatment strategies need to take into account these limits to better target those HIV-infected patients who could benefit the most from antiretroviral therapy.
