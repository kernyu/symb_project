Groups of C57BL inbred mice infected with each of the 4 different isolates, (Anhui, Hubei, Sichuan and Yunnan) of Schistosoma japonicum from the mainland of China were treated with praziquantel (PZQ) and the parasiticidal effects were compared. Worm reduction rate was recorded to assess systematically the sensitivity of 4 different isolates to PZQ in the mouse. Three dosage-levels of PZQ, ie 150, 230 and 310 mg/kg body weight in single doses were used. The worm development rates of control groups infected with schistosomes from Anhui, Hubei, Sichuan and Yunnan were 75.5, 81.8, 81.5, and 83.0%, respectively. At the dosage-level of 150 mg/kg, the worm reduction rates for the 4 different isolates were 36.0, 33.9, 25.5 and 35.6%, respectively. At the dosage-level of 230 mg/kg, the rates were 47.1, 46.0, 38.1 and 47.7%, while at the dosage-level of 310 mg/kg, they were 59.3, 58.6, 50.8 and 61.7%, respectively. The results indicated that the worm reduction rate of the Sichuan isolate was lower than that of the other three isolates, however, the differences were not statistically significant, suggesting that schistosomes of Anhui, Hubei, Sichuan and Yunnan isolates bear resemblance in drug response.
