Tellurium compounds are used in several industrial processes, although they are relatively rare in the environment. Genes associated with tellurite resistance (TeR) are found in many pathogenic bacteria. Tellurite can be detoxified through interactions with cellular thiols, such as glutathione, or a methyltransferase-catalyzed reaction, although neither process appears involved in plasmid-mediated TeR.
