Major reasons to conduct antibiotic policies are to improve the quality of patient care, to limit the emergence of resistance, and to contain costs. Many studies have addressed overconsumption and misuse of antibiotics. Studies have shown a correlation between antibiotic use in hospitals and the development of microbial resistance. Recommendations for the content and management of future antibiotic policy strategies in hospitals include educational programmes, consultation by infectious diseases physicians, restriction of the formulary, timely narrowing of empirical broad spectrum therapy ('streamlining'), and automatic stop orders. A recent study in a Dutch university hospital revealed overconsumption of antibiotics for prophylaxis in surgery and undertreatment with antibiotics in internal medicine departments. Intervention resulted in better compliance with guidelines, reduction of the consumption of antibiotics in surgical prophylaxis, and cost containment. However optimation of antimicrobial therapy also sometimes resulted in an increase of antimicrobial drug consumption.
