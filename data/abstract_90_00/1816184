We examined the in-vitro antibiotic susceptibility of 760 gastroenteric salmonellae and 36 strains of Salmonella typhi isolated in Hong Kong between 1985 and 1988. S. typhi remained susceptible to all the antibiotics tested except for one isolate resistant to chloramphenicol, another to kanamycin and co-trimoxazole, and a third to nalidixic acid. In contrast, resistance and multiple resistance has increased significantly in gastroenteric salmonellae over the last ten years. Seventeen percent were resistant to ampicillin, 61% to tetracycline, 23% to chloramphenicol and 8% to gentamicin. Many ampicillin-resistant strains remained resistant to ampicillin even in the presence of sulbactam (69%) or clavulanic acid (25%). More than 50% of isolates were resistant to two or more antibiotics and one isolate was resistant to eleven. Ampicillin-resistance was usually due to the production of TEM-1 or OXA-1 beta-lactamases but a few isolates produced AER-1, PSE-1 or PSE-2. Genetic determinants for these enzymes were usually borne on plasmids ranging in size from 2 to 143.7 Md but half of the OXA-1 genes were chromosomally located.
