The successful prevention and management of oral infections and infections from the oral cavity in cancer patients are based on identification of risk patients, selection of patients for prophylactic measures, diagnosis of infection and implementation of directed or empiric antimicrobial therapy. Identification of patients at risk for infection is based on each patient's type of oral microbial colonization and the presence of latent viral infections. Systemic and local resistance to infection will be decisive, and in many patients the risk can be estimated from the expected myelosuppressive effect of anticancer treatment. Diagnosis of infection is often based on clinical findings together with the results of microbiological investigations. Biopsies could be useful, but can seldom be obtained. Blood samples are mandatory for isolation of microorganisms involved in systemic infections in myelosuppressed patients. Prevention of infection requires both local and systemic measures. Elimination of the risk of a breach in the first line of defence is urgent, and the maintenance of mucosal integrity is important. Monitoring microbial colonization is common, as is the institution of antiviral prophylaxis in patients with increased anti-HSV IgG (ELISA > 10,000). Antifungal prophylaxis, to avoid colonization and superinfection, should be instituted in patients with low neutrophil counts. Gastrointestinal prophylaxis with quinolones is also commonly used in these patient groups. Treatment of oral infections in cancer patients should include systemic antimicrobial agents in most cases. Special attention should be directed to oral infections in neutropenic (< 0.5 x 10(9)/1) patients in whom oral microorganisms are the leading cause of bacteraemia. Invasive fungal infections of the oral cavity can be associated with systemic fungal infection and are indications for the use of liposomal amphotericin B.
