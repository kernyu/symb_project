Thirty-one of 104 clinical isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae collected over a period of 8 months were found to be putative extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producers. Isoelectric focusing and an iodine overlay agar method were used for preliminary identification of the ESBLs. They were further identified by DNA sequencing. Seventy-one percent of the isolates were found to produce SHV-5. The variation in the ESBL patterns of these isolates was slight, with only five patterns being identified. The strains were typed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), and 16 different genotypes were identified. When the PFGE patterns were analyzed by the algorithmic clustering method called the unweighted-pair group method using arithmetic averages, five clusters were found. However, significant genetic variations were found among 11 isolates and between each cluster. A plasmid of 36 kb was found in all clinical isolates and in the transconjugants. Our results indicate that the increase in the number of ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae isolates in this hospital is due mainly to the dissemination of a resistance plasmid rather than to the clonal spread of a few epidemic strains.
