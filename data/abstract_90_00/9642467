Patients with Plasmodium falciparum infections were selected with an in vivo chloroquine sensitivity assay in a mesoendemic area of Senegal. Gametocytemia was studied in relation to asexual parasite responses classified as drug-sensitive or showing RI or RII resistance. Gametocyte prevalence and density appeared significantly higher in resistant infections than in sensitive ones. These observations were made on children as well as on adults. The period between first clinical symptom appearance and treatment, varying from 0 to 5 days, was not linked to asexual parasite responses, but was significantly and positively correlated to gametocyte prevalence and density observed seven days after beginning the treatment. The comparison between these results and those previously observed in a hypoendemic area suggests that the dynamic of gametocytemia is independent of the endemic level. These observations illustrate that the dissemination of chimioresistant malaria can be reinforced--via the gametocyte stage--by selective chloroquine pressure.
