Accuracy of activity of ribosome isolated from UV-light-induced streptomycin-resistant R-21 mutant of Streptomyces granaticolor was measured in an E. coli-derived system translating poly(U) with a high rate and accuracy. Ribosomes from the R-21 mutant strain were shown to be resistant to streptomycin and about two-fold more accurate than those from the wild type. The mutant strain was found to be resistant to 1000 mg/L streptomycin (Stm) during vegetative growth while it sporulated on agar plates containing only up to 200 mg/L of Stm. The growth rate of the R-21 mutant in complex liquid medium was indistinguishable from that of the wild-type strain.
