There are several sets of guidelines for the treatment of infective endocarditis, reflecting the need for differing treatment in various countries and times. This review considers the need for differing treatment modalities and in particular the utility of the glycopeptide antibiotics vancomycin and teicoplanin. Specific recommendations are offered as to when to consider the use of glycopeptides, appropriate dosage, length of treatment course and whether to use monotherapy or combined therapy. Used judiciously, the glycopeptides give results as good as can be achieved with other antimicrobial agents without exceptional toxicity. The potential of teicoplanin for use in the outpatient treatment of infective endocarditis is considered.
