The dihydrofolate reductase gene from Candida albicans has been cloned and partially characterized. A genomic bank from C. albicans strain 10127/5 was constructed in Escherichia coli and screened for trimethoprim resistance. A plasmid pMF1, carrying the resistance marker was isolated and characterized by restriction mapping and Southern blotting. Cells harbouring pMF1 were as sensitive as the parental cells to a wide spectrum of antibacterial agents, except for trimethoprim; the dihydrofolate reductase activity from these cells was trimethoprim resistant.
