Considerable progress has been made in the development of effective hospital infection control programs in countries with limited resources, most notably in Asia and Latin America. National nosocomial infection surveillance methods are now used in a variety of countries, particularly in Brazil, and offer a better measure for evaluating the rates of common nosocomial infections and gauging the effect of prevention efforts. Extending these achievements to other hospitals that presently lack effective programs is an organizational and logistic challenge for the future. Newer, daunting problems are the prevention and control of antimicrobial resistance and nosocomial transmission of tuberculosis. Improvements in the protection of healthcare workers from exposure to bloodborne pathogens, research regarding the safety and efficacy of the reuse of single-use items, and more practical and affordable methods for sterilization and disinfection are needed.
