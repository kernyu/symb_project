A novel 16-membered lactone antibiotic named tubelactomicin A was isolated from the culture broth of an actinomycete strain. The producing organism, designated MK703-102F1, was identified as a member of Nocardia. Tubelactomicin A was isolated from the culture broth by Diaion HP20 absorption, ethyl acetate extraction, silica gel and Sephadex LH-20 column chromatographies and centrifugal liquid-liquid partition chromatography (CPC). Tubelactomicin A showed strong activity against acid-fast bacteria including the drug-resistant strains.
