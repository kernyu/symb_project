A Kluyveromyces lactis mutant, hypersensitive to the DNA-targeting drugs ethidium bromide (EtBr), berenil, and HOE15030, can be complemented by a wild-type gene with homology to SIR2 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (ScSIR2). The deduced amino acid sequence of the K. lactis Sir2 protein has 53% identity with ScSir2 protein but is 108 residues longer. K. lactis sir2 mutants show decreased mating efficiency, deficiency in sporulation, an increase in recombination at the ribosomal DNA locus, and EtBr-induced death. Some functional equivalence between the Sir2 proteins of K. lactis and S. cerevisiae has been demonstrated by introduction of ScSIR2 into a sir2 mutant of K. lactis. Expression of ScSIR2 on a multicopy plasmid restores resistance to EtBr and complements sporulation deficiency. Similarly, mating efficiency of a sir2 mutant of S. cerevisiae is partially restored by K. lactis SIR2 on a multicopy plasmid. Although these observations suggest that there has been some conservation of Sir2 protein function, a striking difference is that sir2 mutants of S. cerevisiae, unlike their K. lactis counterparts, are not hypersensitive to DNA-targeting drugs.
