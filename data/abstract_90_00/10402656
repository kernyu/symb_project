We have convey comparative study of including intensity of marking protein predecessors and nucleic acids by initial strains of Staphylococcus aureus sensitive to antibiotics and strains, which contain plasmids of resistance to different antibiotics. Shown including intensity increase of adenine, uridine, thymidine and marked amino acids by strains which contain plasmids of resistance to different antibiotics to compare with unplasmids variant. On the base of receiving results we may affirm that in general we observe intensification of protein synthesis and separate staves nucleic acid synthesis by observing staunch strains.
