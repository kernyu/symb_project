Drug therapy in AIDS is used to prolong life as there are many infections and malignancies which appear as a consequence of the immunosuppression and these can be fatal. Current anti-virals which specifically inhibit HIV replication are being used earlier to extend quality of life, maintain immune status and reduce the prevalence of opportunisitic infections and malignancies. Some infections cannot yet be treated and new therapies are awaited. It is too early in the epidemic for significant drug resistance to emerge. However, this is to be expected in the future. The prevalence of adverse drug reactions is significantly increased and therefore newer alternatives are keenly awaited. Drug treatment of HIV infected individuals is a formidable task requiring skilled multidisciplinary approach. This review summarises the most current treatment modalities for HIV associated infections and malignancies.
