The antimicrobial resistance patterns and plasmid profiles of Salmonella typhi isolates from sporadic cases (n = 33) and an outbreak (n = 48) were compared. Of 28 sporadic drug-resistant isolates, 24 (85.7%) were multiply resistant. The predominant antibiotic resistance pattern was TeCmSmSxTAp, which was also the most common pattern of the outbreak isolates. 13 drug-resistant strains isolated before the outbreak (46.4%) were able to transfer the whole resistance pattern or part of it to Escherichia coli K 12 by conjugation. Although 20 of the sporadic strains contained plasmid DNA, transferable R plasmids were only detected in 13 (65%) of them. Among the outbreak strains, the rate of R plasmid transfer was 92.3%, with only the TeCmSmSxTAp pattern transferred. Plasmid profiling and Hind III endonuclease digestion of plasmid DNA identified a 91.2 megadaltons (Mda) plasmid that was recovered from most of the outbreak isolates and from 4 strains collected before the outbreak. This plasmid coded for TeCmSmSxtAp and transferred the pattern of resistance in toto. The results indicate multidrug-resistant S. typhi as a potential cause of infection in the region.
