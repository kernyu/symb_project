Forces to which individual implant units are subjected when an implant-stabilised mandibular over-denture is loaded have been measured using a carbon-fibre reinforced epoxy resin replica of an edentulous mandible mounted in a loading rig which simulated physiological conditions. Three different retentive designs were used; ball attachments, a fixed-fixed bar cranked anteriorly, and a similar design with posterior cantilevers. Forces exerted on the implants were measured using resistance strain gauges mounted on their trans-mucosal abutments and the dentures were loaded at individual tooth positions with a strain gauge beam. Ball attachments were associated with the lowest detected forces on the abutments. It is concluded that variations in superstructure design affect the forces transmitted by implants stabilising a complete mandibular over-denture, when the mandible is suspended and loaded in a physiological manner.
