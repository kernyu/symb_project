A 33-year-old woman with quiescent systemic lupus erythematosus developed meningitis due to a penicillin-resistant strain of Streptococcus pneumoniae. After an initial failure of penicillin therapy, the patient responded to cefotaxime. The meningitis was complicated by total neurosensory hearing loss. Howell-Jolly bodies noted on peripheral blood smear led to a radionuclide spleen scan, which documented functional asplenia. This woman is the second patient in the United States with meningitis caused by a strain of S. pneumoniae moderately resistant to penicillin G (minimal inhibitory concentration, 1.0 microgram/mL). The resistant isolate displayed resistance to penicillin that was not of enzymatic origin but rather was due to an alteration of penicillin-binding proteins. This experience illustrates the importance of testing the in vitro susceptibility of the pneumococcus to penicillin G.
