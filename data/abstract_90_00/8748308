Patients whose gastrointestinal tracts are colonized with vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) may serve as a reservoir for nosocomial transmission. We compared the sensitivities and concordance of several methods used to detect VRE colonization. Eighty-two paired rectal and perirectal swabs were obtained from 13 patients over a 9-day period. The sensitivity of both rectal and perirectal swabs was 79%. There was 100% concordance of culture results between simultaneously obtained rectal and perirectal swabs, and the quantities of growth were similar by these two methods of detection. Our data suggest that rectal and perirectal swabs are equally sensitive for the detection of VRE colonization.
