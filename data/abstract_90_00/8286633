Five patients with non-urinary tract infections caused by Corynebacterium urealyticum were seen during an 8-year period at a university hospital in Madrid. Bacteremia (one case) and wound infections (four cases) were the most relevant features of these cases. Treatment with vancomycin, surgery, and supportive measures contributed to a favorable outcome for four of the five patients.
