Cefixime in a dose 20 mg/kg/day, orally, divided into two doses 12 h apart for a minimum of 12 days, was administered to 50 children with proven S. typhi septicaemia. Forty four of the patients were infected with strains of S. typhi resistant to multiple antibiotics including chloramphenicol, ampicillin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. All patients responded rapidly to treatment and were cured clinically and bacteriologically. Fever subsided within a mean of 5.3 days (range 3-8 days). Only two of the 50 patients treated relapsed during the 8 week follow-up period. No serious adverse reactions attributable to the drug were observed. Cefixime proved to be an effective oral drug in this open treatment trial and was associated with minimal side effects. It may provide a therapeutic alternative to the treatment of Salmonella infection with organisms multi-resistant to the standard drug regimens. Its oral formulation may provide an efficient alternative to parenteral therapy in less severely ill patients who can tolerate oral feeding.
