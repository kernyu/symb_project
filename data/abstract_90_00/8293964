The fosfomycin susceptibility of 100 clinical isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae and the resistance mechanisms utilized by resistant strains were examined. Washed cells prepared from the strains demonstrating MICs of more than 8 micrograms ml-1 of fosfomycin inactivated the drug. A crude extract from strain Tf129B, highly resistant to fosfomycin, was used to study the enzymatic properties of the drug-inactivating enzyme. The optimum pH for inactivation was 7.8 and the optimum temperature of the reaction was 37 degrees C. Glutathione was shown to be effective as a cofactor in the inactivation. It was suggested that the inactivating enzyme of Klebsiella pneumoniae was fosfomycin: glutathione-S-transferase, a constitutive enzyme located in the periplasmic space. A good correlation was found between the specific activities of this enzyme and the MIC levels; however, certain strains showed a low level of fosfomycin:glutathione-S-transferase activity which could not account for the increased MIC. Strains Tf129B and Tf408E, both demonstrating MICs of more than 1024 micrograms ml-1 of fosfomycin carried a transferable resistance plasmid. In strain Tf129B, the mechanism of fosfomycin resistance was due to a high level of enzymic activity. In strain Tf408E, it was determined to be mainly due to the reduced permeability of the cell membrane.
