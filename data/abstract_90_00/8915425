OBJECTIVE: To determine the potential clinical usefulness of duplex Doppler estimation of arcuate artery resistive index (a measure of intrarenal blood flow impedance) for diagnosis of aminoglycoside-induced nephrotoxicosis. ANIMALS: 30 adult, female, mixed-breed dogs, allotted to 3 groups of 10 dogs each as: toxic dosage of gentamicin, therapeutic dosage of gentamicin, and saline solution sham equivalent in volume to that of the toxic dosage of gentamicin. PROCEDURE: After baseline screening to establish normalcy (serum biochemical analysis, endogenous creatinine clearance determination, urinalysis, urine protein-to-creatinine ratio, urine culture, gray-scale sonography, and percutaneous ultrasound-guided renal biopsy), results of arcuate artery resistive index determination were compared with serum creatinine and urine specific gravity values on a Monday-Wednesday-Friday data collection schedule for 10 days. Endogenous creatinine clearance determination, ultrasound-guided renal biopsy, and urine culture were repeated at the end of data collection in all 3 groups. RESULTS: Significant differences in resistive index measurements were not observed, despite clinicopathologic and renal biopsy results compatible with severe acute tubular necrosis in dogs of the toxic dosage group. CONCLUSIONS: Duplex Doppler sonography of arcuate artery blood flow impedance, expressed as the resistive index, appears to have poor clinical usefulness as a diagnostic tool in this disorder. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Normal arcuate artery resistive index values obtained in dogs for which aminoglycoside-induced nephrotoxicosis is suspected do not exclude the disorder. If abnormal arcuate artery resistive index values are obtained for such dogs, further evaluation for nephropathies other than aminoglycoside-induced nephrotoxicosis may be considered.
