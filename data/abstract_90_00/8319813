In vivo and in vitro susceptibility of Plasmodium falciparum to chloroquine were conducted at Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), Mathura, India. 18 out of 31 cases showed resistance [minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) 8 pmol] in in vitro study. EC50 and EC90 values estimated from log-probit analysis for resistant isolates were 0.66 and 1.44 microM/litre, and for sensitive isolates 0.28 and 0.96 microM/litre blood respectively. In vivo tests identified 13 cases (40.62%) as resistant and 19 cases (59.73%) as sensitive out of 32 cases. All the cases belonged to IOC, Mathura complex, or its vicinity.
