The growing importance of anthelmintic resistance in cyathostomes (small strongyles) of horses poses a threat to the health and welfare of all types of horses. On the basis of published information on cyathostomes of horses, six recommendations are made for reducing the development and spread of anthelmintic resistant nematodes. The need for restraint in the use of anthelmintics, the application of epidemiological principles of worm control and a greater emphasis on pasture management are the principal recommendations.
