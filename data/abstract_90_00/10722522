We studied the effect on viral growth of drugs targeting different virus functions using a computer simulation for the intracellular growth of bacteriophage T7. We found that drugs targeting components of negative-feedback loops gain effectiveness against mutant viruses that attenuate the drug-target interaction. The greater inhibition of such mutants than of the wild type suggests a drug design strategy that would hinder the development of drug resistance.
