The in vivo efficacy of LY333328, a new glycopeptide antibiotic, was compared with that of vancomycin by using the rabbit model of left-sided methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus endocarditis. Animals received LY333328 or vancomycin (25 mg/kg of body weight every 24 or 8 h, respectively) for 4 days. These drugs were equally effective in clearing bacteremia and in reducing bacterial counts in vegetations and tissues. We conclude that in this model, LY333328 was microbiologically effective and may be a therapeutic alternative to vancomycin.
