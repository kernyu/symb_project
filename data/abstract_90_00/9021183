ER-35786 is a new parenteral 1 beta-methyl carbapenem with a broad antibacterial spectrum and a potent antipseudomonal activity. It showed high in vitro activity, comparable to those of meropenem and a new carbapenem, BO-2727, against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and streptococci, with MICs at which 90% of strains tested are inhibited (MIC90S) of < or = 0.39 microgram/ml. Against methicillin-resistant S. aureus, ER-35786 was the most active among the compounds tested, yet its MIC90 was 12.5 micrograms/ml. Against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Haemophilus influenzae, ER-35786 inhibited 90% of strains tested at a concentration of < or = 1.56 micrograms/ml. The MIC90 of ER-35786 for Pseudomonas aeruginosa was 3.13 micrograms/ml, and the compound was more active than meropenem. In addition, the activity of ER-35786 against imipenem-, meropenem-, cefclidin-, or ceftazidime-resistant P. aeruginosa was equal to or higher than that of the most active reference compound. The in vivo activity of ER-35786 was consistent with this in vitro activity. The in vivo activity of ER-35786 was highest for systemic infection models with methicillin-resistant S. aureus and beta-lactam-resistant P. aeruginosa strains. In acute pneumonia caused by P. aeruginosa, ER-35786 produced a greater reduction in the viable cell count in the lungs than did imipenem-cilastatin or meropenem.
