The fluoroquinolones ciprofloxacin (Ciproxin) and ofloxacin (Tarivid) have recently been marketed in Norway. Fluoroquinolones are active against most Gram-negative aerobic pathogens, but have a relatively poor impact on Gram-positive organisms. Mutation in the gyrase-A-gene of a bacteria may lead to resistance to all quinolones. There is little cross-resistance towards other antibiotics. A strong tendency to resistance has been observed among Pseudomonas, Staphylococci and Enterococci. Ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin are administered orally, and are distributed well in the body. The dose should be reduced in elderly patients. Approximately 10% experience adverse effects, mostly in the gastrointestinal and central nervous systems. Ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin are used mainly in the treatment of recurrent and/or complicated urinary tract infections. Other indications include gonorrhea, serious gastrointestinal infections and chronic Salmonella carrier states.
