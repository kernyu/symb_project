The kinetics of reinitiation of chromosome replication of eight dnaA(Ts) mutants was investigated in an isogenic set of strains. Five mutants (167, 46, 601, 606 and 5) are classified as reversible, since they can reinitiate at 30 degrees C without protein synthesis, whereas the other three (508, 205, 204) require protein synthesis. In the presence of protein synthesis, reversible mutants initiate one round of replication rapidly after a shift to 30 degrees C, indicating that they contain active or renaturable DnaA protein. The dnaA508 and dnaA204 mutants also reinitiate chromosome replication rapidly, whereas reinitiation is delayed 15-20 min in dnaA205. The dnaA508 and dnaA204 mutants might contain active DnaA protein just below the threshold level at 42 degrees C and only require synthesis of small amounts of new DnaA protein before initiation at 30 degrees C, whereas dnaA205 accumulates DnaA protein for some time at 30 degrees C before reaching the initiation threshold. Three of the reversible mutants (5, 601, and 606) exhibited, in addition to the protein synthesis-independent initiation capacity, an RNA synthesis-independent initiation capacity. The thermal stability of these initiation capacities is the same as for mutant DnaA protein, strongly suggesting that mutant DnaA protein is responsible for both.
