We investigated the efficacy and toxic potential of antimalarial therapy regimens in 452 malaria patients treated between 1980 and 1990. Drug regimens in 330 non-immune travellers were compared with those of 122 semi-immunes with acute malaria; 71% patients acquired their infection in tropical Africa, and the 288 Plasmodium falciparum infections were the most prevalent species. Because of increasing drug resistance or toxicity of chloroquine, pyrimethamine-sulfadoxine and even mefloquine, quinine proved to be the most effective antimalarial against P. falciparum and the only one which did not lead to recrudescences. These occurred in 10% patients after chloroquine and 6% after mefloquine. Cinchonism occurred in 25% of those treated with quinine, but it was fully reversible and never necessitated withdrawal of the drug. We conclude that quinine is highly effective in the treatment of P. falciparum infection and is mandatory if the clinical condition requires a fast-acting blood schizonticide, in cases of hyper-parasitaemia and if multi-drug resistance occurs; its use should not be restricted by reversible side-effects such as cinchonism.
