The renal vasculature of young spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) responds to angiotensin II (ANG II) with exaggerated vasoconstriction, due in part to defective buffering by the adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) pathway. In vitro studies suggest greater activation of phospholipase C and protein kinase C (PKC) in cultured mesangial cells and vascular smooth muscle cells. The present studies evaluated the role of PKC activation in renal vascular responses to ANG II receptor activation and the relative contributions in SHR vs. Wistar-Kyoto control rats (WKY). Renal blood flow was measured in 8-wk-old anesthetized SHR and WKY pretreated with indomethacin. ANG II (2 ng) injection into the renal artery produced a transient 45-50% maximum reduction of renal blood flow in both rat strains. Intrarenal infusion of either staurosporine or chelerythrine into the renal artery effectively attenuated the vasoconstriction elicited by ANG II in a dose-dependent manner, with maximum inhibition of 60-70%. The PKC inhibitory effects were significant and independent of strain. Coadministration of the PKC inhibitors produced maximal inhibition similar to that observed with one agent, suggesting action via a common pathway. In other studies, the linkage of the PKC pathway to the AT1 receptor was evaluated using sub and maximal doses of losartan to antagonize 50-80% of ANG II-induced vasoconstriction. The same degree of inhibition was observed when a PKC inhibitor was coadministered with losartan. These findings support the views that the PKC system is a major intracellular signaling pathway coupled to the AT1 receptor in renal resistance vessels and that PKC activation is involved to similar degrees in the renal vasoconstriction elicited by ANG II in young WKY and SHR. Exaggerated vascular reactivity to vasoconstrictor agents in genetically hypertensive animals is probably due to a defect in cAMP generation in the presence of a normally operating PKC pathway.
