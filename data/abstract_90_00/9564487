Vaginal trichomoniasis poses a difficult therapeutic challenge when metronidazole is ineffective or contraindicated. We conducted a retrospective study of 6.25% paromomycin cream in the treatment of nine women referred with cases of vaginal trichomoniasis where metronidazole resistance or allergy was present. Results obtained immediately and 1 month after treatment were reviewed. The median age of the patients was 46 years; four women were nulliparous. The median symptom duration was 1 year. Five women were allergic to metronidazole. In four cases, resistance to high doses of metronidazole was demonstrated. Smears or cultures were positive immediately after treatment for three patients; a fourth relapsed 2 weeks later. Of these patients for whom treatment failed, one was cured with a 3-week course of paromomycin cream, and another was successfully treated with paromomycin cream and oral tinidazole. Three patients developed vaginal ulcerations that resolved spontaneously. Adverse effects may be a result of local formulation. Paromomycin cream was useful for treatment of cases of trichomonas infection where metronidazole resistance or allergy was encountered.
