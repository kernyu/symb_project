We report a Lyell syndrome secondary to anti-malarial treatment with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine. Eye lesions predominated: symblepharon and corneal opacification. Desinsertion of conjunctival synechias was performed by ophthalmologists. There were corneal opacities and fibro-vascular veil on the two eyes. A keratoprosthesis was done on one eye. It is very likely that the incidence of this syndrome will increase mainly because of two factors. The continuous increase of plasmodii resistance to chloroquine hence the more frequent use of sulfonamides for the treatment of malaria; secondly, sulfonamides are used in the treatment and prevention of opportunistic infections in AIDS patients. It is important for ophthalmologists in tropical areas to be aware of Lyell's syndrome so that proper and early management may be undertaken.
