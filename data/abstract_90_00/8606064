To further investigate the immunological properties of the stage-specific 82-kDa glycoprotein (gp82) of Trypanosoma cruzi metacyclic trypomastigotes, previously shown to induce antigen-specific humoral and T-cell responses in mice, we performed a series of experiments with recombinant proteins containing sequences of gp82 fused to glutathione S-transferase. Of five fusion proteins tested, only J18b and J18b1, the carboxyproximal peptides containing amino acids 224 to 516 and 303 to 516, respectively, were recognized by monoclonal antibody 3F6 as well as by various anti-T. cruzi antisera and, when administered to mice, were capable of eliciting antibodies directed to the native gp82. The amino-terminal peptide and other carboxyterminal recombinant proteins lacking the central domain of gp82 (amino acids 224 to 356), which is exposed on the surface of live metacyclic forms, did not display any of these properties. Spleen cells derived from mice immunized with any of the five recombinant proteins proliferated in vitro in the presence of native gp82.J18b was the most stimulatory, whereas J18b3, the peptide containing amino acids 408 to 516, elicited the weakest response. When BALB/c mice immunized with J18b antigen plus A1(OH)3 as adjuvant were challenged 10 5 metacyclic trypomastigotes, 85% of them resisted acute infection, in comparison with control mice that received glutathione S-transferase plus adjuvant. Antibodies induced by J18b protein lacked agglutinating or complement-dependent lytic activity and failed to neutralize parasite infectivity. On the other hand, CD4+T cells from the spleens of J18b-immunized mice displayed an intense proliferative activity upon stimulation with 1.25 microgram of native gp82 per ml, which resulted in increased production of gamma interferon, a cytokine associated with resistance to T. cruzi infection.
