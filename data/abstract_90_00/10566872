Few data on antimicrobial susceptibility of invasive Streptococcus pneumoniae isolated in Italy are available. Ninety-two invasive isolates from all over the country collected from January 1997 to April 1998 were tested for sensitivity to penicillin, erythromycin, ceftriaxone, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole by the agar dilution method. Five (5.4%) strains were resistant to penicillin (one highly, four intermediately resistant), 8 (8.7%) to chloramphenicol, 27 (29.3%) to erythromycin, 17 (18.5%) to tetracycline (16 highly, one intermediately), and 21 (22.8%) to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (14 highly, 7 intermediately). All strains were susceptible to ceftriaxone, although the penicillin-resistant strain had the highest minimal inhibitory concentration. (MIC) value (0.5 microg/ml); three penicillin-resistant strains were also resistant to erythromycin. Eight strains were multi-drug resistant, being also resistant to at least three antibiotics. The commercially available E test was compared with the standard agar dilution method for the determination of MIC of penicillin, erythromycin, ceftriaxone, chloramphenicol, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. E test established the same susceptibility categories for 100% of the strains tested for penicillin and ceftriaxone, 99% for chloramphenicol, 97% for erythromycin, and 74% for trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. According to our results, E test was simple to perform, easy to interpret, and a valid method for susceptibility testing of S. pneumoniae. Our study shows that in Italy the rate of penicillin resistance in invasive isolates of S. pneumoniae is one of the lowest in Europe (5.4%), while the rate of erythromycin is very high (29.3%) and is reaching the highest rates of other Southern European countries.
