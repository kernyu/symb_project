Effective control of tuberculosis transmission in vulnerable population groups is dependent on rapid identification of the infectious agent and its drug susceptibility. However, the slow growth rate of mycobacteria has undermined the ability to quickly identify antimicrobial resistance. These studies describe a mycobacterial growth assay based on microencapsulation technology used in conjunction with flow cytometric analysis. Mycobacteria were encapsulated in agarose gel microdrops approximately 25 microns in diameter, and colony growth was monitored by using flow cytometry to evaluate the intensity of auramine staining after culture for various times at 37 degrees C. By this method, colony growth of Mycobacterium bovis and M. smegmatis could be quantified within 1 to 3 days after encapsulation. Inhibition of growth by rifampin and isoniazid was also evaluated in this time period, and the presence of an isoniazid-resistant subpopulation representing 3% of the total microorganisms could be detected. This use of encapsulation and flow cytometry has the potential to facilitate rapid and automated evaluation of inhibition of growth by antimicrobial agents and shorten the time frame for analysis of clinical specimens.
