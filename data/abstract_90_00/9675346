We report a case of cutaneous atypical mycobacteriosis in a 12-year-old healthy girl due to Mycobacterium avium. The cutaneous symptoms were three well-defined subcutaneous nodules on both buttocks and on the posterior surface of the left thigh. One had a fistulous opening on the skin surface. Histopathological examination revealed epithelioid cell granulomas surrounded by dense lymphocytic infiltration and acid-fast bacteria were seen with modified periodic acid-carbol fuchsin staining. Using Ogawa's medium at 37 degrees C, acid-fast bacteria were isolated from the biopsied specimen and identified by the DNA-DNA hybridization method as Mycobacterium avium. In drug susceptibility test, these were resistant to all antituberculous drugs. Oral administration of minocycline 100 mg/day for two months had little effect on the two remaining lesions, which were therefore excised. Based upon reported cases of Mycobacterium avium complex, we considered that our pediatric patient with multiple intradermal or subcutaneous nodules on the buttocks and the thigh exhibited the characteristic symptoms of M. avium infection.
