Serial nasopharyngeal swab and bronchoalveolar lavage cultures were used to estimate changes in the bacterial flora of the respiratory tracts of calves during the first month after arrival in the feedlot. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) differential cell counts served to evaluate pulmonary inflammatory changes during this period. Two groups of calves were studied, one consisting of clinically normal controls (n = 60), the other, of cases (n = 59) which received treatment for respiratory disease (penicillin +/- trimethoprimsulfadoxine). A variety of organisms, including Pasteurella multocida, Pasteurella haemolytica, Haemophilus somnus, Mycoplasma bovis and Mycoplasma bovirhinis, were present in the upper and lower airways of both groups during the postarrival period. With the exception of M. bovis, an overall decline in the prevalence of these organisms was observed during the course of the study. In cases, there was a marked decrease in the number of Pasteurella spp. and H. somnus isolates immediately following treatment. For the Pasteurella spp., however, this effect was shortlived as they often appeared to recolonize the respiratory tract within eight days of terminating antimicrobial therapy. Treatment did not appear to affect the frequency of isolating M. bovis. Its prevalence, in both groups of calves, increased to levels approaching 100% during the course of the study. All Pasteurella spp. isolates were tested for susceptibility to several commonly used antimicrobials. Resistance was only evident among P. haemolytica isolated from cases and in every instance this was to a combination of penicillin, ampicillin and tetracycline. Significantly more isolates were resistant after treatment than before. There were BAL differential cell count abnormalities indicative of inflammation in both cases and controls.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
