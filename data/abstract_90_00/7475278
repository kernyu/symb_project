The in vitro antitumor activities of the nucleoside analogs, 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine (CdA) and 9-beta-arabinosyl-2-fluoroadenine monophosphate (Flu), and the alkylating agent, chlorambucil (CLB), were compared in leukemic cells from 28 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). On a molar basis, the median sensitivities of the cells to these agents were CLB > CdA > Flu. CLL cells from 90% of the patients had similar relative orders of sensitivities to CdA and Flu, while cells from 10% of the patients showed differential sensitivities to these agents. There was no relationship between the sensitivities of the cells to the nucleoside analogs and sensitivity to CLB. CdA and CLB produced similar toxicities to human marrow progenitor cells in vitro, while Flu was less toxic to these cells. An 18 h exposure to CdA produced significantly greater cell kill of both CLL and marrow progenitor cells than an equivalent 2 h treatment; however, the difference in cytotoxicity was greater for the tumor cells resulting in a higher therapeutic index with the 18 h treatment. The intracellular accumulation of drug varied 5-fold for CdA, with the major metabolite being CdAMP, and 15-fold for Flu, with the major metabolite being F-ara-ATP. However, the accumulation of CdA, Flu or their metabolites did not predict for drug sensitivity. These studies suggest that CdA and Flu cross-resistance cannot be assumed in all CLL patients. The therapeutic effectiveness of CdA may be enhanced by use of a prolonged, low-dose drug regimen.
