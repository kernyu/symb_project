The sensitivity to the major antimicrobial agents of consecutively isolated gram-negative rods in intensive care units in Switzerland was investigated. A majority of strains originated from clinical specimens where infection or colonization could not be distinguished from each other. A total of 1024 isolates from 482 patients were tested by a standardized microtiter method. Of the beta-lactam antibiotics, imipenem (92% of bacteria sensitive), ceftazidime (90%), and aztreonam (85%) showed the greatest activity. 94% of the isolates were sensitive to ciprofloxacin, and 93% and 91% to amikacin and tobramycin respectively. There where considerable differences locally and in time, probably reflecting small outbreaks due to resistant bacteria and because selective pressure is locally dependent on the antimicrobial agents used. 122 patients were observed for an extended period. In 67 (55%) the same gram-negative rods persisted for up to 42 days without development of resistance. In 41 patients (34%) there was a change to other more resistant bacteria, especially to multi-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Flavobacterium meningo-septicum, Xanthomonas maltophilia or Enterobacter cloacae. In 12 patients (10%) bacteria of the same species with resistance to additional antimicrobial agents were observed.
