(R)-Trichostatin A (TSA) is a Streptomyces product which causes the induction of Friend cell differentiation and specific inhibition of the cell cycle of normal rat fibroblasts in the G1 and G2 phases at the very low concentrations. We found that TSA caused an accumulation of acetylated histone species in a variety of mammalian cell lines. Pulse-labeling experiments indicated that TSA markedly prolonged the in vivo half-life of the labile acetyl groups on histones in mouse mammary gland tumor cells, FM3A. The partially purified histone deacetylase from wild-type FM3A cells was effectively inhibited by TSA in a noncompetitive manner with Ki = 3.4 nM. A newly isolated mutant cell line of FM3A resistant to TSA did not show the accumulation of the acetylated histones in the presence of a higher concentration of TSA. The histone deacetylase preparation from the mutant showed decreased sensitivity to TSA (Ki = 31 nM, noncompetitive). These results clearly indicate that TSA is a potent and specific inhibitor of the histone deacetylase and that the in vivo effect of TSA on cell proliferation and differentiation can be attributed to the inhibition of the enzyme.
