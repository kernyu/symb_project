A national anti-tuberculosis program has been in operation in Madagascar since 1991. Despite the significant efforts made in the management, education and surveillance of patients, the number of patients lost to treatment remains high (18.8%). Noncompliance with treatment is the principal cause of treatment failure and of the development of resistance to tuberculosis drugs. This study investigated the profile of the patients who discontinue treatment. The study population consisted of the patients withdrawing from a clinical trial carried out between August 1994 and September 1996. The aim of the trial was to compare several treatments in routine practice conditions in Madagascar. The treatments tested were streptomycin (S) or ethambutol (E) associated with isoniazid (H), rifampicin (R) or pyrazinamide (Z) for the first two months, followed by 6 months of treatment H and thiacetazone (T). The trial involved four public and three private diagnosis and treatment centers in Antananarivo, Fianarantsoa and Mahajanga. A total of 1, 023 patients were included in the trial and 192 (18.8%) withdrew during the eight-month treatment period. We tracked down 109 of these patients (56.8%) and 19 patients came back to the treatment center on their own initiative for a checkup. The rate of response to a recall letter sent by mail was low. The 106 patients interviewed mostly gave professional, financial or family reasons for discontinuing treatment. Many patients stopped the treatment as soon as they began to feel better. To reduce the number of patients discontinuing treatment, the National Anti-Tuberculosis Program should improve the education of patients and their families.
