One mycotoxin and three therapeutic drugs widely used in developing countries were examined for genotoxic activity by means of the w/w + somatic recombination assay. Streptozotocin (SZ), an antibiotic antineoplastic agent, gave a frequency of light spots almost one order of magnitude higher than those obtained with the carcinogen mycotoxin sterigmatocystin (STC), the antiprotozoal and antimicrobial metronidazole (MNZ), and the antifungal griseofulvin (GF). Thus the order of response was SZ > STC > MNZ > GF. Chronic treatment turned out to be the better route of exposure for these genotoxins when compared with surface treatment. The performance of the insecticide-resistant strain Hikone-R was better than that of the wild genotype LS (Leiden Standard). The positive test results obtained with all four chemicals showed that the P450 system of Drosophila is capable of metabolizing these genotoxins into electrophilic intermediates.
