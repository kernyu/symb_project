Chloroquine resistance in Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) malaria in four districts of Rajasthan, viz Dungarpur, Banswara, Udaipur and Kota, is reported. In vivo sensitivity of Pf to chloroquine base 25 mg/kg/body weight over three days was evaluated as per standard WHO method. A total of 3112 blood smears were collected and examined; 279 cases were selected but only 98 completed the study. Twenty four per cent of cases were sensitive, and 54% resistant at RI, 4% at RII and 9% at RIII levels. Eight per cent of cases were either sensitive or resistant at RI level.
