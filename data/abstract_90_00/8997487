Retrovirally encoded proteases are responsible for the maturation of immature viral particles yielding mature, infectious virus. This is done by apparent (auto)-processing and self-activation of the protease (PR) from a larger viral gag-PR-(pol) protein (zymogen) precursor and subsequent processing of the viral reverse transcriptase (RT) and integrase (IN), and the gag protein precursor into mature gag proteins. Only the matured components are capable of forming capsids for intact, infectious viruses. Blocking this proteolytic process results in production of immature, non-infective virions. All retroviral proteases are aspartic-type proteases. Determination of the three-dimensional structure revealed retroviral proteases as small, nearly symmetric homodimers. This prompted de novo design of inhibitors for the HIV protease taking advantage of the unique symmetric structure of the active center, unparalleled by cellular proteases. The novel substances inhibit in vitro the HIV protease at nanomolar/subnanomolar concentrations and exhibit very low toxicity. They are inactive against human proteases such as renin or pepsin. The HIV protease inhibitors (PI) represent a promising alternative to the reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitors (AZT, ddC, ddI) hitherto used with limited success for HIV chemotherapy. Clinical studies confirmed the low toxicity but revealed a pharmacological pattern typical for these hydrophobic compounds, such as low water solubility, poor oral bioavailibility, and short plasma half-life. Typical for antimicrobial agents, also a resistance phenomenon became evident. Latest clinical results show, however, promisingly that both problems might be overcome by application of the PI in combination with RT inhibitors (such as AZT, ddI or ddC) exerting a remarkable synergistic antiviral effect with lasting restoration of the CD4-T-cell level.
