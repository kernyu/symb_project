The present investigation describes a novel method of demonstrating strain diversity among Pasteurella haemolytica biovar A, serovar 2 (PhA2) nasal turbinate isolates from a flock of 32 experimental goats during a naturally occurring outbreak of pasteurellosis. After a 21 day conditioning period in a feedyard, 51 PhA2 isolates from 27 culture-positive goats were identified including 1 on day 22, 14 on day 25, 21 on day 39, and 15 on day 66. Each PhA2 isolate was evaluated for its enzyme activity against 19 substrates with a commercial semiquantitative enzyme system and for its antimicrobial susceptibility with 12 drugs, resulting in 7 different enzyme profiles and 8 different antimicrobial susceptibility profiles. A total of 14 combined enzyme and antimicrobial susceptibility profiles were produced. The same PhA2 strain was isolated from only 4 of the 12 goats with 2 PhA2 isolations, while the same PhA2 strain was isolated from only 1 of the 6 goats with 3 PhA2 isolations. The data from this investigation demonstrated that the PhA2 upper respiratory tract flora from goats is highly heterologous.
