Activities of combinations of beta-lactams, daptomycin, gentamicin, teicoplanin, and vancomycin against 11 clinical isolates of Enterococcus faecium highly resistant to glycopeptides, three plasmid-cured derivatives, eight E. faecalis and E. faecium transconjugants, and two susceptible recipient strains were tested. A marked synergy between penicillins or imipenem and glycopeptides against the glycopeptide-resistant strains but not against the glycopeptide-susceptible strains was observed by the double-disk agar diffusion assay. The synergy of combinations of amoxicillin, imipenem, penicillin G, or piperacillin with vancomycin or teicoplanin against resistant strains was confirmed by the checkerboard technique. The fractional inhibitory concentration indexes were generally below 0.25, except for one strain of E. faecium resistant to high levels of penicillin G. However, the combinations were not bactericidal as tested by time-killing experiments, and high concentrations (64 micrograms/ml) of amoxicillin, penicillin G, or piperacillin combined with 8 micrograms of vancomycin or teicoplanin per ml tended to be antagonistic. Addition of 4 micrograms of gentamicin per ml to these combinations enhanced their bactericidal effect, but they occasionally remained slightly less effective than beta-lactams associated with gentamicin. The combination of 10 micrograms of daptomycin per ml with gentamicin was bactericidal after 6 h against 11 glycopeptide-resistant strains.
