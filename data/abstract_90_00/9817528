A case is reported of a patient who developed Acinetobacter meningitis after an external ventricular drainage system had been fitted for control of intracranial pressure. During the process, nine strains of Acinetobacter isolated from her cerebrospinal fluid were indistinguishable by analysis of total genomic DNA by pulse-field gel electrophoresis. The first eight strains were sensitive to meropenem and imipenem (MICs < 1 g/l). The MIC of the last one, which had been recovered after 32 days during two courses of treatment with meropenem, increased to > 32 g/l for meropenem, while with imipenem the increase was minimal (MIC = 1.5 g/l). The microorganism persisted in the central nervous system despite the administration of different antimicrobials, including intraventricular aminoglycosides and six changes in the external ventricular system. The patient died 68 days after admission to the intensive care unit from bilateral cerebral ischemic lesions, intraventricular hemorrhage and cerebral edema with endocraneal hypertension, the Acinetobacter ventriculitis also contributing to this state.
