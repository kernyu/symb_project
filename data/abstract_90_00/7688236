This article presents the seventh case of human infection due to Mycobacterium terrae. This report of typical tenosynovitis clearly illustrates well all of the standard problems raised by this kind of atypical acid-fast mycobacterial infection: delayed and difficult diagnosis, danger of steroid infiltrations, frequency of recurrence. Nevertheless, M. terrae has certain specific features: it is probably less pathogenic than other atypical acid-fast such as marinum. Some authors propose surgical treatment alone, but this case suggests the need for surgery combined with antituberculous therapy.
