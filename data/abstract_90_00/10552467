The effect of a single oral administration of proanthocyanidins, oligomeric and polymeric polyhydroxyflavan-3-ol units, on the antioxidative potential of blood plasma was studied in rats. Proanthocyanidin-rich extract from grape seeds was administered by intragastric intubation to fasted rats at 250 mg/kg of body weight. The plasma obtained from water- or proanthocyanidin-administered rats was oxidized by incubation with copper sulfate or 2, 2'-azobis(2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride (AAPH) at 37 degrees C, and the formation of cholesteryl ester hydroperoxides (CE-OOH) was followed. The plasma obtained from proanthocyanidin-administered rats was significantly more resistant against both copper ion-induced and AAPH-induced formation of CE-OOH than that from control rats. The lag phase in the copper ion-induced oxidation of rat plasma was remarkably increased at 15 min after administration of proanthocyanidins and reached a maximum level at 30 min. When the plasma from proanthocyanidin-administered rat was hydrolyzed by sulfatase and beta-glucuronidase following analysis by high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection, metabolites of proanthocyanidins occurred in rat plasma at 15 min after administration, three peaks of which were identified as gallic acid, (+)-catechin, and (-)-epicatechin. These results suggest that the intake of proanthocyanidins, the major polyphenols in red wine, increases the resistance of blood plasma against oxidative stress and may contribute to physiological functions of plant food including wine through their in vivo antioxidative ability.
