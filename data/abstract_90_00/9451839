This article describes conventional procedures which are used for susceptibility testing of bacteria isolated from food producing animals against anti-infective substances. Interpretation of results obtained from the different test methods and the conditions necessary to conduct these tests in view of a meaningful resistance monitoring are discussed. Currently, published data about the resistance situation in veterinary medicine are either not representative or have been determined under suboptimal conditions. In view of the public and often non-scientifically based discussion about bacterial resistance it is absolutely necessary to generate a scientifically valid database.
