It was revealed that ability of zink chloride, copper sulphate, aluminium nitrate and sodium chloride to inhibit the nitrate reduction of Pseudomonas correlated with their potentiating influence on the antimicrobial activity of decamethoxin, a quaternary ammonium derivative. So, doses of zink chloride (0.01-0.04%), copper sulphate (0.04%), aluminium nitrate (0.04%), sodium fluoride (0.05-0.1%) able to inhibit effectively the reduction of anions of nitric acid decreased the minimal inhibitory concentration of decamethoxin against Pseudomonas strain ATCC 27853 to 0.15-10 mg/ml and minimal bactericidal concentration to 0.20-10 mg/ml in comparison with 15.6 and 60.4 mg/ml in the control without potentiators. Providing the use of respiration chain's inhibiting doses of sodium fluoride (0.1%) and zink chloride (0.01%), it became possible to decrease the resistance of 54 clinical samples of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to decamethoxin.
