Ethanol is a common cause of both acute and chronic pancreatitis. Studies in other organs suggest that polymorphonuclear neutrophils activated by ethanol may cause tissue injury in a variety of conditions. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of ethanol on neutrophil extravasation in the feline pancreas. Pancreata were isolated and perfused at different flow rates with varying concentrations of ethanol in either a physiological or neutrophil depleted perfusate. Neutrophil extravasation was assessed by measuring pancreatic tissue myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity. Ethanol at 2.5% (54.25 mmol/liter) was the lowest concentration that still caused significant neutrophil extravasation (3.1+/-0.8 vs 1.9+/-0.2 units, P<0.05) and was accompanied by an increase in vascular resistance of 15%. Reduction of pancreatic perfusion by 15% did not significantly increase neutrophil extravasation. (1.1+/-0.3 vs 1.6+/-0.2 units, NS) Perfusion of the pancreas with neutrophil-depleted blood containing either ethanol or saline, followed by perfusion with an ethanol-free perfusate, showed an increase in neutrophil extravasation in the ethanol group compared to the control group (3.2+/-0.9 vs 1.9+/-0.2 units, P<0.05). In conclusion, ethanol causes neutrophil extravasation in the feline pancreas independent of blood flow changes and occurs despite the absence of direct neutrophil exposure to ethanol.
