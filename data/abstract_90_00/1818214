Pentamidine isethionate inhibits growth of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Inhibition requires lower drug concentrations under respiratory than fermentative growth conditions. Pentamidine-resistant strains bear heritable resistance mutations. Tested mutations are dominant to wild type sensitivity. These mutations may identify cellular targets of pentamidine and potential mechanisms of fungal pentamidine resistance.
