Individuals infected with Toxoplasma gondii normally develop resistance to the parasite, resulting in an asymptomatic chronic infection. In AIDS patients, this resistance is lost leading to reactivation of infection and development of encephalitis. To characterize the cytokine response of T. gondii-infected individuals, PBMC were cultured in vitro in the presence or absence of crude tachyzoite Ags (STAg). When stimulated with STAg, PBMC from T. gondii-infected donors, but not controls, produced high levels of Type 1 lymphokines (IL-2 and IFN-gamma) as well as the monokine IL-12, in the absence of detectable Type 2 lymphokines (IL-4 and IL-5). In contrast, cells of individuals from both groups produced high levels of IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-alpha when exposed to the same Ag preparation. By using highly purified elutriated cells, we demonstrated that monocytes are a major source of these monokines. The above findings were further expanded by analyzing the cytokine responses induced by STAg in PBMC from patients co-infected with T. gondii and HIV. Our results demonstrate that parasite-specific IL-2 and IFN-gamma responses are greatly impaired even before AIDS development, as is IL-12 synthesis by PBMC from HIV-infected individuals stimulated with STAg. In contrast, the release of IL-6 and TNF-alpha triggered by STAg is either not affected or augmented during HIV infection.
