Antimicrobial resistance increases worldwide. Among many factors, such as clonal spread of genes of resistance among and intra species, local epidemiology, nosocomial transmission, also consumption of antimicrobials may be responsible. Cancer departments, mainly in centers treating hematologic malignancies and organizing bone marrow transplantation (BMT) are known to have extensive consumption of either prophylactically or therapeutically administered antibiotics and antifungals. It is worthy to remember, that first strains of quinolone resistant E. coli, vancomycin resistant enterococci and staphylococci and fluconazol-resistant Candida albicans appeared in the patients treated for cancer with antineoplastic chemotherapy, resulting in profound granulocytopenia. Therefore, assessment of risks of antibiotic prophylaxis with quinolones and azoles and extensive use of empiric therapy with glycopeptides and polyenes needs to be considered. Intensive prophylactic strategies should be limited to group of high risk, leukemic patients or BMT recipients.
