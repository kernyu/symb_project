The betacyte is a genetically engineered insulin-secreting liver cell line that is glucose responsive. Whether this cell is affected by specific beta-cell toxins is unknown. To explore this possibility we exposed these cells and those from the NIT-1 beta-cell line (positive controls) to the toxins streptozotocin (STZ, 2.5-20 mM), alloxan (ALL, 2.5-20 mM), and pentamidine (PENT, 10(-6)-1 mM). STZ and ALL were added for 1 h and pentamidine for 24 h. Insulin secretion from betacytes during a period of 5 h after removal of the toxin was inhibited only by pentamidine; all agents were inhibitory to NIT-1 cells. Glucose metabolism, as determined by a colorimetric MTT reduction assay, was adversely affected in betacytes by ALL (20 mM) and PENT (1 mM), and in NIT-1 cells by STZ (20 mM) as well as by ALL (2.5 mM) and PENT (1 mM). The magnitude of inhibition was less for the betacytes-58 v. 99%. Confluence of cells in culture wells and cell viability as assessed by the fluorochromes propidium iodide and acridine orange was reduced to a lesser extent for the betacytes than for the NIT-1 cells. The metabolic and microscopic effects of the toxins were unchanged in the betacyte from those in the liver cell line, HEP G2, from which the betacyte was engineered. These results of general resistance of the betacyte to beta-cell toxins with differing modes of action offer hope that this cell, or cells created in a similar manner from primary hepatocytes, may be at least partly resistant to the adverse effect of beta-cell toxins involved in autoimmune destruction of the pancreas. This increases the potential of the use of these cells for reversal of diabetes.
