The generalized mismatch repair system of Streptococcus pneumoniae (the Hex system) can eliminate base pair mismatches arising in heteroduplex DNA during transformation or by DNA polymerase errors during replication. Mismatch repair is most likely initiated at nicks or gaps. The present work was started to examine the hypothesis that strand discontinuities arising after removal of uracil by uracil DNA-glycosylase (Ung) can be utilised as strand discrimination signals. We show that mismatch repair efficiency is enhanced 3- to 6-fold when using uracil-containing DNA as donor in transformation. In order to assess the contribution of Ung to nascent strand discrimination for postreplication mismatch repair, we developed a positive selection procedure to isolate S. pneumoniae Ung- mutants. We succeeded in isolating Ung- mutants using this procedure based on chromosomal integration of uracil-containing hybrid DNA molecules. Cloning and characterization of the ung gene was achieved. Comparison of spontaneous mutation rates in strains either proficient or deficient in mismatch and/or uracil repair gave no support to the hypothesis that Ung plays a major role in targeting the Hex system to neosynthesized DNA strands. However Ung activity is responsible for the increased efficiency of mismatch repair observed in transformation with uracil-containing DNA. In addition Ung is involved in repair of bisulfite-treated transforming DNA.
