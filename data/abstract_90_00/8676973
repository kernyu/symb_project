OBJECTIVE: To investigate the spread of HIV strains resistant to antiviral drugs prescribed in the Netherlands. DESIGN: Descriptive. SETTING: Amsterdam. METHOD: In several cohorts of homosexual men and intravenous drug users being followed in Amsterdam, in cases of newly acquired HIV infections in the period 1992-1995 HIV RNA was isolated from serum. The nucleic acid sequence encoding the first 250 amino acids of the HIV reverse transcriptase was determined in order to detect mutations conferring resistance to reverse transcriptase inhibitors. RESULTS: Among participants of the Amsterdam cohort studies, 12 new HIV infections of homosexual men and 23 of IV drug users were observed. In the group of homosexual men the first infection by a zidovudine-resistant HIV was observed in 1995. In the group of IV drug users the first infection by a zidovudine-resistant strain was noticed in 1993 with two more infections in 1995. The mutations regarded positions 41, 67, 70 and 215 of the HIV reverse transcriptase. No HIV strains resistant to didanosine, deoxycytidine, lamuvidine or nevirapine were found in untreated persons with an acute infection. CONCLUSION: As zidovudine is a vital part of the latest and most efficacious combination therapies of HIV infection, testing for zidovudine-resistance prior to treatment is recommended.
