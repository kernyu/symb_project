The resistances of 1,156 stocks of Salmonella isolated between 1980-1981 were compared with the 1,528 stocks of Salmonella obtained between 1986-1987 against three elective antibiotics such as ampicillin, chloramphenicol, and cotrimoxazole. The number of resistant stocks and the resistances to the above antibiotics are increasing (9.7% during the first period and 13.6% during the second, p = 0.002). Resistances to multiple agents increased from 1.8% to 4.38% (p = 0.0006). During the period of 1986-1987 there were stocks resistant to the three studied antibiotics.
