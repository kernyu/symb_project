The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of ten antibiotics were determined by the agar dilution method for 40 strains of penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, all of which were clinical isolates from this laboratory. The antibiotics tested were clarithromycin, erythromycin, teicoplanin, vancomycin, ceftriaxone, cefodizime, azithromycin, ramoplanin, ciprofloxacin and MDL 62873. Of these agents, clarithromycin, vancomycin, teicoplanin, ceftriaxone, ramoplanin and MDL 62873 were the most active. The role of these antibiotics as alternatives to penicillin for the treatment of infections caused by penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae is discussed.
