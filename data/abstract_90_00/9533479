In order to assess the current level of resistance to widely used antipseudomonal antibiotics in clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a national survey was undertaken. Fifteen hospitals throughout Italy participated in the study. The University of Catania tested the antibiotic susceptibility of 1005 consecutive clinically significant P. aeruginosa collected from March to June 1995. Lack of susceptibility, according to NCCLS breakpoints, was at the following rates: meropenem, 9.1%; imipenem, 19.3%; ceftazidime, 13.4%; carbenicillin, 27.3%; piperacillin, 12%; ticarcillin/clavulanic acid, 22.8%; amikacin, 10.6%; and ciprofloxacin, 31.9%. About half of the isolates (44.4%) were not susceptible to at least one of the antibiotics tested.
