Ceftriaxone, a highly effective, B-Lactamase resistant broad spectrum parenteral cephalosporin was used in the treatment of 26 consecutive patients with clinically and/or bacteriologically resistant infections at the Addis Ababa University Tikur Anbessa and Ethio-Swedish Paediatric Teaching Hospitals. The patients who had failed to respond to a combination of two or more previously appropriate antibiotics were treated with ceftriaxone administered in two divided doses (daily 50-100 mg/kg) in children and a single dose of 2-3 gm in adults for an average duration of 9.9 days. Of the 21 evaluable cases 16 (76%) were cured, three died and two developed superinfection with Pseudomonas and Staphylococcus species. Primary pathogenic bacteria were eradicated from all the 21 bacteraemic patients on the third day of therapy. Twelve of the 21 patients had serious underlying conditions. Except for the two superinfections, the results of the trial confirm that ceftriaxone is a very potent and effective agent in the treatment of resistant bacteraemic infections. No significant adverse effect of the drug was encountered during the therapy.
