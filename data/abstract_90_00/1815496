In vitro restoration of adriamycin sensitivity in a resistant human breast tumor cell line was obtained by continuous exposure to nanomolar nontoxic valinomycin concentrations. Seven-day treatment with nanomolar valinomycin concentrations caused a slight increase of the signal of the cationic fluorescent cyanine probe DiOC5(3) but did not appreciably affect adriamycin incorporation in the cells. A marked increase of the DiOC5(3) signal was obtained in the presence of micromolar valinomycin concentrations, which were incompatible with the in vitro cellular growth.
