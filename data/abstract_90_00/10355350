MRSA/MRSE infections are a major problem in hospitals and although in orthopaedic units the incidence is low awareness of this problem is necessary. Once a MRSA strain has been isolated the strict use of the hygiene precautions has to be applied to avoid epidemic spread of the strain. The patient has to be isolated. The staff has to use gloves and gowns whilst treating the patient. A antimicrobiel hand wash solution has to be used after taking off the gloves and before leaving the isolation room. Patient and staff have to be informed about the pathogenicity and the way of infection spread so that infection precaution rules are fulfilled. Antibiotics should only be used in clinically well defined cases and the overall use of antibiotics should be reduced to lower the incidence of MRSA/E isolates. The problems of an MRSA case and its successful treatment are demonstrated.
