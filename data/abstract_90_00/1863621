The antimicrobial susceptibility of 235 anaerobic bacterial strains to ornidazole, metronidazole, chloramphenicol, clindamycin, penicillin, cefoxitin and imipenem has been studied using agar-dilution technique. Ornidazole and metronidazole were active against 88.6% and 86% of gram-positive cocci. Overall, 99.1% of Bacteroides group fragilis, and 91.3% of non-fragilis Bacteroides were also sensitive to both drugs. We did not find any Clostridium perfringens resistant strain. Cefoxitin and penicillin showed good activity against all Clostridium perfringens strains, and also against 97.7% and 92.5% of gram-positive cocci. We found one single imipenem resistant strain among gram-positive bacteria. Bacteroides fragilis also showed sensitivity to penicillin (41.5%), cefoxitin (85.7%) and imipenem (97.1%). Clindamycin was active against Clostridium perfringens (90.9%), gram-positive cocci (86.7%) and imipenem (68.6%). Chloramphenicol showed good activity against Clostridium perfringens (100%), gram-positive cocci (95.5%) and Bacteroides spp. (99.4%). Our results showed an overall good activity of all the seven drugs tested against anaerobic gram-positive microorganisms. Of notice, we found a good activity of chloramphenicol, imipenem, metronidazole and ornidazole against Bacteroides spp.
