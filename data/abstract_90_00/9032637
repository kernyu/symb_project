This case-control study was undertaken to identify the risk factors for the gastrointestinal carriage of vancomycin-resistant, Gram-positive cocci (VRGPC) including vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). Use of oral vancomycin (P = 0.003) or cephalosporins (P = 0.03) and prolonged duration of stay in the hospital (P = 0.02) were found to be the significant risk factors. Other previously suggested risk factors such as location of the patients and presence of central venous or arterial lines were not significantly associated with carriage of VRGPC. Judicious usage of glycopeptides (particularly oral vancomycin) and cephalosporins is likely to be the most effective way to prevent and control the spread of VRGPC and VRE.
