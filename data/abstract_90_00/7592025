In two pandavir (nigericin) producing strains, Streptomyces hygroscopicus 155 and Streptomyces albogriseolus 444, an enzyme activity was detected leading to inactivation of the antibiotic in the presence of ATP-Na2. Apparently, the observed inactivation is specific for the antibiotic produced by these strains. The nigericin producing strains were also found to be less permeable to pandavir than their non-producing variants.
