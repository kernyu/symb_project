The antibiotic susceptibilities of 1,002 Streptococcus pneumoniae clinical isolates from patients with community-acquired pneumonia were determined over an 18-month period. Resistance rates were 14% for penicillin, 20% for erythromycin, 26% for tetracycline, and 1% for chloramphenicol. Resistance to non-beta-lactam antibiotics was associated with penicillin resistance at statistically levels.
