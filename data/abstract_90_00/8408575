By using cell morphology, arginine dihydrolase, and gas production in de Man, Sharp, Rogosa broth, 122 isolates of vancomycin-resistant lactic bacteria from humans were assigned to five profiles, allowing us to distinguish Pediococcus, homofermentative and heterofermentative Lactobacillus, and Leuconostoc species. The absence of L-(+)-lactic acid, as detected spectrophotometrically, was confirmatory for Leuconostoc species. API 50 CHL panels were useful for the identification of Lactobacillus species.
