We describe a 28-year-old HIV-infected woman with AIDS, defined by cerebral toxoplasmosis and a CD4-count of less than 10 x 10(6) cells/I, who, after several eruptions of genital herpes and typical dermatomal herpes zoster, all successfully treated with acyclovir, developed chronic cutaneous ulcerating lesions on a finger and on the tibia. The lesions were found to contain varicella zoster virus antigen but repeated treatment courses with acyclovir were unsuccessful. After a course of intravenous foscarnet the lesions resolved. They recurred after discontinuation of foscarnet but finally responded to a second course of treatment.
