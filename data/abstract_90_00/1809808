Isepamicin, formerly SCH21420 or 1-N-HAPA gentamicin B, is an aminoglycoside that was tested alone or in combination with one of seven broad spectrum drugs against 80 clinical isolates. Half of the strains were gentamicin-resistant but only one isolate (1.3%) was resistant to isepamicin. The broadest spectrum comparison drugs tested alone (ciprofloxacin at 3.8% resistance and imipenem at 5.0% resistance) were associated with the lowest synergy rates when combined with isepamicin. The rank order of synergy (complete or partial) was; cefotaxime = ceftazidime = ceftriaxone = mezlocillin = piperacillin (75% to 80%) greater than imipenem (66%) greater than ciprofloxacin (38%). Isepamicin/ampicillin combinations produced synergistic killing of those enterococci not having high-grade resistance to gentamicin or kanamycin. Enterococcus faecium strains were also refractory to isepamicin/ampicillin synergy. Isepamicin appears to be widely useable against gentamicin-resistant gram-negative bacilli either alone or combined with most commonly used broad spectrum beta-lactams.
