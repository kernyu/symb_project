Based on the difficulties experienced in the treatment of chromoblastomycosis, 12 primary human isolates of F. pedrosoi, were tested for their in vitro susceptibility to various antimycotics. We adapted the recommendations of the NCCLS for yeasts and followed the indications for mold testing from other authors in order to determine their MIC's and the MLC's. It was found that a significant proportion of the isolates were resistant to 3 of the 4 antimycotics tested, as revealed by high MIC values, as follows: 33% were resistant to amphotericin B (AMB), 58.3% to 5 fluocytosine (5 FC) and 66.7% to fluconazole (FLU). Contrarywise, none of the isolates proved resistant to itraconazole (ITZ). Determination of the MLC's revealed that a larger proportion of the isolates were not killed by AMB, 5 FC (91.7%), FLU (100%) or even, ITZ (41.7%). These data indicate that it would be desirable to determine the susceptibility of F. pedrosoi before initiating therapy, in order to choose the more effective antifungal and avoid clinical failure.
