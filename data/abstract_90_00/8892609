The proto-oncogene product c-Fos, a component of the transcription factor AP-1, is induced in early B lineage cells. To investigate a role of c-Fos in early B cell development, fetal liver (FL) cells from transgenic mice carrying an IFN-alphabeta (IFN)-inducible c-fos gene (Mx-c-fosD) were cultured on a stromal cell layer with IL-7. Although B lineage cells normally developed in the Mx-c-fosD FL cell culture, the development was perturbed by the addition of IFN at the beginning of culture. When IFN was added in the FL culture after B lineage cells developed, pro-B (B220+,CD43+) cells were selectively dying by apoptosis within 48 h after IFN stimulation. This apoptosis was intrinsically induced in the pro-B cells that overexpressed c-fos when the Mx-c-fosD FL (H-2Kb) cells were cocultured with the normal C3H FL (H-2Kk) cells. The molecular basis of the apoptosis was investigated by examining expression of the genes that regulate apoptosis. The IFN stimulation did not modulate expression of Bcl-2 and Fas in early B lineage cells from the Mx-c-fosD FL culture. However, Rag-2 was down-regulated in these cells within 12 h after IFN stimulation. These results suggest that the c-Fos plays a causal role in deletion of pro-B cells with nonfunctional Ag receptor.
