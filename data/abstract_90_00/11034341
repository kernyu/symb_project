Changes in the content of fructose-2,6-bisphosphate, a modulator of glycolytic flux, also affect other metabolic fluxes such as the non-oxidative pentose phosphate pathway. Since this is the main source of precursors for biosynthesis in proliferating cells, PFK-2/FBPase-2 has been proposed as a potential target for neoplastic treatments. Here we provide evidence that cells with a low content of fructose-2,6-bisphosphate have a lower energy status than controls, but they are also less sensitive to oxidative stress. This feature is related to the activation of the oxidative branch of the pentose phosphate pathway and the increased production of NADPH.
