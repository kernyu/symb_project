The serum content of interferon (IF) and its correlation with diverse immunologic parameters were studied in tuberculosis-resistant mice. In primary contamination the IF level was much higher in B10 mice highly sensitive to tuberculosis infection in all periods of the study than that in highly resistant A/Sn mice. In the vaccinated mice which were later infected this tendency remained but IF levels were 1.5--2 times higher than in primary contamination. Comparison of the IF level and the studied resistance parameters in the resistant mice revealed an inverse correlation. If the immunologic parameters in resistant A/Sn mice are higher than those in B10 mice the latter have significantly higher serum IF levels.
