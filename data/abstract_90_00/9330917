Cocaine is often used while consuming ethanol despite evidence that this combination may enhance the toxicity of cocaine. In the present study, we examined the cardiovascular effects of ethanol (475 or 950 mg/kg, i.v.) alone and in combination with cocaine (5 mg/kg, i.v.) in conscious rats. Ethanol or cocaine administration produced a consistent pressor response but highly variable cardiac output and systemic vascular resistance responses. The hemodynamic response patterns in individual rats to either drug were similar and related within rats. After ethanol pretreatment, cocaine produced greater decreases in cardiac output. We have proposed that this pattern of responses may reflect a predisposition in individual rats to cocaine-induced cardiomyopathies and hypertension. Furthermore, these data suggest that ethanol administration elicits a similar pattern of hemodynamic responses as previously reported for cocaine or amphetamine administration or acute behavioral stress.
