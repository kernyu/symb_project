In this study, we investigated tick saliva effects on T cell proliferation, antigen presentation and IFN-gamma-induced macrophage activation, events which are associated with host immune defense mechanisms. Mice repeatedly infested with Rhipicephalus sanguineus ticks, similarly to dogs, did not develop resistance to further infestations. We determined that R. sanguineus tick saliva inhibited, in a dose-dependent manner, both Con-A and specific antigen-induced splenic T cell proliferation. Tick saliva diluted twenty times (64 microg/ml) inhibited Con-A-induced and antigen-specific T cell proliferation in 83% and 69%, respectively. In addition, the inhibition of cell proliferation correlated with a decrease in IL-2 production. Microconcentrator fractionated saliva was tested on a Con-A-induced cell proliferation assay, and showed that one fraction between 3 and 10 kDa and another smaller than 3 kDa can be responsible for the inhibition of T cell proliferation. Although saliva inhibited cell proliferation, it did not impair antigen presentation. Tick saliva further abrogated the killing of intracellular forms of Trypanosoma cruzi by IFN-gamma-activated macrophages. Moreover, saliva-induced macrophage inhibition of IFN-gamma-induced-trypanocidal activity was paralleled with 69% less nitric oxide (NO) production. Finally, tick saliva doubled the production of IL-10 and reduced 84.6% production of IFN-gamma by splenocytes cultured with T. cruzi, suggesting that decreased macrophage NO production may be due to a saliva-induced cytokine imbalance, leading to decreased NO synthase activity. Together, these data indicate that tick saliva can modulate host immune response, thus, contributing to its feeding success and favoring the transmission of tick-borne pathogens.
