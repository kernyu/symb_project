The authors present in this paper a review on a major problem which is less evoked in Tunisia and concerns the use of antibiotics in Veterinary Medicine for reared animals for human consumption. Antibiotics are often mis used; this is true for the practitioner as well as for the breeder. The rules of antibiotic associations and their related problems are also discussed. Specific recommendations to Tunisian users are suggested; the pharmaceutical industry, the veterinarian and the breeder. Each from its side must contribute to the preservation of this valuable therapeutic tool.
