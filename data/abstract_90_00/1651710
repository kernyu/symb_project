We selected the quinolone-resistant mutants from the protein F deficient Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The mutants showed cross-resistance to tetracycline, minocycline and chloramphenicol, but not to the beta-lactam antibiotics. The MIC of ofloxacin (OFLX) against the mutants, but not in the parent, became 2 to 4 times lower as the medium pH was raised from 6.5 to 8.5. The mutants accumulated about half as much OFLX as the parent. The OFLX accumulation in the mutants increased 6.5- to 8-fold in the presence of 100 mM carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone, while that in the parent was 4-fold. The OFLX sensitivity of the mutant DNA-gyrase was comparable with that of the parent's enzyme. These results suggest that the resistance of these mutants to OFLX is associated with the membrane potential dependent drug efflux.
