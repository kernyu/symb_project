Oxidation products of com allelochemicals generated by peroxidases or tyrosinases were tested in 10% sucrose solutions for effects on the corn leafhopper Dalbulus maidis. Some reduction in feeding was noted with hydrogen peroxide (a cofactor for peroxidase). Significant reduction in feeding was noted with chlorogenic acid, ferulic acid, p-coumaric acid, and 6-methoxybenzoxazolinone (MBOA), but not rutin at 400 ppm in solution. Oxidation products of these compounds all caused significantly less feeding by the leafhoppers compared to the original compound. Oxidation products generated by peroxidase from ferulic acid and 6-methoxybenzoxazolinone caused significant mortality to the leafhoppers within 5 days. Thus, provided conditions are such that oxidizing enzymes and allelochemicals can interact due to damage by insects, resistance may be significantly enhanced by the oxidized products as opposed to the effects of the allelochemicals alone.
