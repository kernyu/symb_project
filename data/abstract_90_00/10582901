The distribution of beta-lactamase activities in a collection of actinomycete strains was surveyed. Six of 127 strains were found to produce beta-lactamase. This low frequency was in contrast to the case with Streptomyces species. The producing strains were not related phylogenetically. MICs of benzylpenicillin did not correlate with beta-lactamase production.
