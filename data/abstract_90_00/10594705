A total of 99 Acinetobacter isolates from sewage, freshwater aquaculture habitats, trout intestinal contents and frozen shrimps was characterized phenotypically and antibiotic susceptibility patterns determined. One group of genomic species, including Ac. johnsonii, Ac. lwoffi and spp. 15TU, was detected in all sample types and represented the majority of the isolates (n = 54). Isolates belonging to the Acb complex (Ac. calcoaceticus, Ac. baumannii and genomic species 3) were detected in sewage (n = 6) and frozen shrimps (n = 1), Ac. haemolyticus in frozen shrimps (n = 6) and trout intestinal contents (n = 2) and genomic species 11 in freshwater aquaculture habitats (n = 6) and trout intestinal contents (n = 1). Acinetobacter junii (n = 5), genomic species 10 (n = 2), 14BJ (n = 8) and 16BJ (n = 4) were only isolated from sewage. Acinetobacter isolates from sewage were generally more biochemically reactive and resistant to antimicrobial agents compared with isolates from other sample types. Different strains, often belonging to different genomic species, were isolated from sites situated upstream and downstream of the discharge point of a pharmaceutical plant. This finding supported the hypothesis that the waste effluent from the pharmaceutical plant was likely to cause a change in the distribution of Acinetobacter spp. by selecting and/or introducing antibiotic-resistant strains into the recipient sewers.
