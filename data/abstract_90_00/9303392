Fifty-one lepromatous leprosy patients, all of whom had relapsed after previous dapsone (DDS) monotherapy, were treated between 1990 and 1991 with 600 mg of rifampin (RMP) plus 400 mg of ofloxacin (OFLO) daily for 4 weeks, and the great majority of the patients were followed up at least once a year after completion of the treatment. After only 173 patient-years of follow-up, 5 relapses had been detected; the overall relapse rate was 10.0% (confidence limits, 1.7 and 18.3%), or 2.9 relapses (confidence limits, 0.4 and 5.4) per 100 patient-years. The unacceptably high relapse rate indicated that 4 weeks of treatment with daily RMP-OFLO was unable to reduce the number of viable Mycobacterium leprae organisms to a negligible level. In addition, the M. leprae from one of the relapses were proved to have multiple resistance to DDS, RMP, and OFLO. To avoid further relapses, the follow-up was terminated and the great majority of the patients were retreated with the standard 2-year multidrug therapy from 1994. No further relapse has been diagnosed since the beginning of retreatment.
