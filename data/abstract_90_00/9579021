Increased mortality has been observed when HIV-infected patients were treated with pyrimethamine (Pyr) as prophylaxis for toxoplasmic encephalitis, suggesting that Pyr might possess immunosuppressive activity. To analyze this in an animal model, immune function was assessed in BALB/c mice using a battery of in vivo and ex vivo assays and an in vivo model of host resistance to Listeria monocytogenes infection. Treatment for 30 days with 60 mg/kg Pyr decreased circulating white blood cell and lymphocyte counts but not neutrophil, red blood cell, or platelet counts or hemoglobin levels. Splenic B cell percentages and lipopolysaccharide-induced B cell proliferation decreased significantly after treatment with 60 mg/kg Pyr, as did levels of anti-keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) IgM in serum 7 days after immunization with KLH. Anti-KLH IgG levels 14 days after immunization were not affected. Percentages of splenic T cells and macrophages and T cell proliferation in the presence of concanavalin A or allogeneic cells were not decreased by Pyr treatment. An ex vivo assay of T-cell-mediated cytotoxicity was also unaffected. When host resistance to L. monocytogenes infection was assessed, dramatic increases in mortality were observed in Pyr-treated compared to control mice. Increased numbers of L. monocytogenes organisms were observed in liver and spleen of Pyr-treated mice, compared to controls. The reduction in Listeria resistance, which is T cell mediated, contrasts with the fact that no significant changes in T-cell-mediated immunity were observed. It is possible that Pyr affects parameters of innate immunity, which were not monitored in this study.
