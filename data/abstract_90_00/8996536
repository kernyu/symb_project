The immunosuppressive drug cyclosporin A has been evaluated recently in phase II trials in cancer therapy as a reverter of P-glycoprotein-mediated multidrug resistance. As an immunosuppressive agent, cyclosporin A potentially can enhance tumour growth. We investigated this potency of cyclosporin A in the weakly immunogenic CC531 colon adenocarcinoma model, using the same dose that had previously been shown to intensify the antitumour activity of doxorubicin in vivo. In vitro cyclosporin A caused no growth acceleration and only in high doses was growth inhibition of CC531 cells observed. In vivo no evidence of growth enhancement was found in short-term assays but, after 4 weeks, rats treated with cyclosporin A had a significantly higher tumour load, mainly consisting of locoregional metastases. These experiments in the CC531 tumour model show that cyclosporin A, used as a reverter of multidrug resistance, may produce short-term improvement of antitumour activity but may also induce enhancement of tumour metastasis.
