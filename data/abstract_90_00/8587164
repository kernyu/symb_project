In order to investigate antimicrobial activities of clavulanic acid/ticarcillin (CVA/TIPC) against Escherichia coli, Enterobacter spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 1992 and 1994, beta-lactamase activities were analyzed and minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined including those of the control drugs. The results are as follows; 1. Compared to a report in 1980, the MIC distributions of CVA/TIPC against E. coli and P. aeruginosa did not show large differences. We found, however, that CVA/TIPC-resistant strains increased among Enterobacter spp. 2. Almost all of CVA/TIPC-resistant strains of Enterobacter spp. were also resistant to cephems and new quinolones, thus they were multiple drug resistant. 3. CVA/TIPC showed strong antimicrobial activities against penicillinase producing E. coli.
