A total of 61 clinical isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae from Lebanon were tested for their susceptibility to penicillin G and seven other antibiotics by the agar dilution technique. All penicillin-susceptible isolates were also susceptible to chloramphenicol, ceftriaxone and erythromycin. Penicillin-resistant isolates were consistently susceptible only to erythromycin.
