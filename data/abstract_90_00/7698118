Mycobacterium haemophilum is emerging as a pathogen of immunocompromised patients particularly those with AIDS and organ transplants. Infection has also occurred in healthy children. Adults usually present with cutaneous manifestations, septic arthritis or occasionally pneumonia. Children have perihilar, cervical or submandibular adenitis. The organism grows on mycobacterial media supplemented with ferric ammonium citrate or hemin, incubated at 30 degrees C to 32 degrees C, two to three weeks after inoculation. The most active antimicrobial agents in vitro are amikacin, ciprofloxacin, clarithromycin, rifabutin and rifampin. Development of resistance to the rifamycins has been demonstrated after patients were treated for several months with several antimycobacterial agents, including the rifamycins. Treatment for several months with at least two agents demonstrated to have low MICs for the organism has been shown to be effective.
