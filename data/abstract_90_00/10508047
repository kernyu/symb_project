We evaluated several 3-day antimicrobial regimens in the treatment of experimental endocarditis caused by an oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strain exhibiting intermediate susceptibility in vitro to vancomycin (VISA). Neither vancomycin alone nor trovafloxacin exhibited in vivo efficacy; addition of amikacin to vancomycin yielded a modest in vivo effect. In contrast, the combination of ampicillin and sulbactam was highly effective in vivo, causing a mean decrease in VISA vegetation densities of >5 log(10) CFU/g versus those of untreated controls.
