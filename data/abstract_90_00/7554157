The sensitivity of P. falciparum to chloroquine (CHL), piperaquine (PIP), artesunate (ATS), dihydroartemisinine (DAT), artemether (ATM), arteether (ATE) and pyronaridine (PRN) were assayed by in vitro microtechnique in China-Laos border in 1992. The resistance rates of isolates from the south of Yunnan of China in the border were 97.0%, 96.4%, 12.5%, 16.0%, 6.3% and 34.5%, respectively; ID50 were 119.0, 320.0, 7.2, 5.4, 295.0, 74.4 and 31.9 nmol/L, ID95 were 625.0, 2426.0, 42.2, 36.6, 767.0, 371.1 and 325.2 nmol/L. The resistance rates of isolates from the north border of Laos were in order 9/10, 8/10, 1/5 to CHL, PIP, PRN, ID50 were 114.0, 166.9, 16.4 nmol/L, ID95 were 570.0, 631.1 and 107.7 nmol/L. All the isolates from Laos were sensitive to ATS, DAT, ATM and ATE. ID50 were 5.0, 4.4, 91.6 and 56.7 nmol/L, ID95 were 23.4, 11.1, 3276.1 and 223.9 nmol/L, respectively. The results indicate that P. falciparum in the border was highly resistant to CHL and PIP, while most of the isolates were susceptible to the other 5 of the above-mentioned drugs. A comparison between the isolates from China and Laos showed that there was no significant difference in resistance degree to CHL but the sensitivity of isolates from China to other 6 drugs was lower than those from Laos.
