Against main clinical isolates at our center in 1990 to 1992, the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of cefminox (CMNX) and some other comparable cephems were determined. The results are summarized as follows. 1. As to the strains resistant to cephems including CMNX, annual increases were observed for Streptococcus pneumoniae among Gram-positive bacteria and Proteus vulgaris among Gram-negative bacteria. Moreover, cephem-resistant strains of Escherichia coli were constantly isolated, and there were signs indicating that cephem-resistant strains would increase among strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae. 2. The annual increases in cephem-resistant strains of S. pneumoniae and P. vulgaris may respectively reflect the recent increases in the incidence of benzylpenicillin (PCG)-insensitive strains of S. pneumoniae (PISP) and multi-drug resistant strains including oxime type cephems and new quinolones introduced into clinical use in the latter half of the 1980s. 3. Concerning antimicrobial activities of CMNX against recent clinical isolates, the same problems as described above will remain. However, these tendencies have been observed only with regard to MIC90. No remarkable changes have been noted for MIC50 or MIC80 at this time.
