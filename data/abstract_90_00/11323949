Candida organisms live on the skin and mucous membranes of up to 75 percent of the population. They can live commensally without causing harm or can change to an aggressive form and invade tissue, causing both acute and chronic disease in the host. Oropharyngeal candidiasis manifests clinically as acute pseudomembranous, acute atrophic, chronic atrophic, chronic hypertrophic/hyperplastic, and angular cheilitis. Systemic infection leading to candidemia can be devastating and cause up to a 60 percent mortality rate in medical or post-surgical intensive care wards. Oral nystatin, clotrimazole, and fluconazole usually provide appropriate therapy; although resistance to medications is increasing, particularly in immunocompromised hosts.
