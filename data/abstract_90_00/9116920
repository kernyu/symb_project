OBJECTIVES: Essential hypertension and insulin resistance frequently coexist; cyclosporine A (CsA) is known to induce hypertension which has been used as a model for essential hypertension. The present study aimed to evaluate whether elevated blood pressure and insulin resistance coexist during CsA therapy to prove the similarity between essential hypertension and CsA induced hypertension. DESIGN: Normotensive patients who underwent keratoplasty were investigated before and during single therapy with CsA (2-4 mg/kg body weight) in an open A-B Trial. PATIENTS: Eighteen lean, normotensive patients without metabolic disorders with normal renal function and without family history of hypertension or metabolic abnormalities. MAIN METHODS: Insulin sensitivity index was determined by the modified frequent sampling intravenous glucose tolerance test (FSIGT) and blood pressure was determined by indirect ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. RESULTS: Mean insulin sensitivity index (S1) was significantly reduced (p < 0.03) during treatment with CsA (4.4 +/- 2.6 x 10(-4) vs 2.8 +/- 2.0 x 10(-4)/min per microU/ml), whereas mean systolic daytime blood pressure increased from 126.4 +/- 10.8 mmHg to 135.7 +/- 11.8 mmHg (p < 0.02), as well as the corresponding diastolic blood pressure from 76.8 +/- 8.7 mmHg to 82.8 +/- 9.3 mmHg (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: CsA therapy induces elevated blood pressure and insulin resistance as seen in patients with essential hypertension, thus CsA induced hypertension is considered to have pathophysiological similarities to essential hypertension.
