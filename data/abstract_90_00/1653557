The question of whether interferon alpha/beta is the common mechanism of antiviral action of synthetic immunomodulators was investigated in B6C3F1 mice infected with Semliki Forest virus. Mice were treated with various concentrations of normal sheep serum or potent anti-alpha/beta interferon antiserum, inoculated with the immunomodulators, and infected 24 hours later with virus. Three patterns emerged. The antiviral action of the pyrimidinone (ABMP) and the oral interferon inducer (CL246,738) appeared to be mediated primarily by interferon alpha/beta; their protective ability was almost completely abrogated by treatment with low levels of anti-alpha/beta interferon antiserum. The antiviral action of two other immunomodulators, a mismatched polyribonucleotide (Ampligen) and a polyanionic copolymer (MVE-2) at least partially involved interferon. Activity of these compounds was reduced, but not consistently eliminated by treatments with high doses of antiserum. The antiviral activity of another polyribonucleotide, polyriboinosinic-cytidylic acid complexed with lysine carboxymethylcellulose (poly ICLC), was not affected by treatment with even the highest amount of antiserum (two injections of 100,000 neutralizing units each). Almost complete protection by poly ICLC was observed despite the fact that this high concentration of antiserum, when given alone, caused a decrease in natural resistance to Semliki Forest virus infection. Taken together, these results indicate that induction of interferon alpha/beta does not appear to be the major common mechanism of antiviral activity among these diverse synthetic immunomodulators.
