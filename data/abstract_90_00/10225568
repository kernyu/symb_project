The susceptibility of Canadian isolates of three respiratory tract pathogens (Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis and Streptococcus pneumoniae) to several antimicrobial agents were tested by two different methods. Beta-lactamase was produced by 68/211 (32.2%) of H. influenzae isolates and 64/75 (85.3%) of M. catarrhalis isolates. For S. pneumoniae, 19/156 (12.2%) isolates were resistant to penicillin (MIC > or = 0.12 mg/L) and two isolates had MICs of 1.5 mg/L. For some combinations of agents and organisms, different methods gave different values for the proportion of isolates susceptible. Regardless of methodology, for H. influenzae, the most active antimicrobials based on proportion of strains susceptible were ciprofloxacin (100%) and cefpodoxime (98.5-100%). For M. catarrhalis, the most active agents were azithromycin, cefaclor, cefixime, cefpodoxime, cefuroxime, ciprofloxacin, clarithromycin and loracarbef (100% each); the least active was ampicillin. Against penicillin-sensitive and -resistant pneumococci, the activity was not significantly different for azithromycin and clarithromycin (93.4-100%) and ciprofloxacin (MIC90 2.0 and 1.5 mg/L, respectively) but was different for cefuroxime (99.3% and 31.6%, respectively), cefaclor (MIC90 0.75 and > or = 256 mg/L, respectively), cefpodoxime (MIC90 0.047 and 1.5 mg/L, respectively) and loracarbef (MIC90 0.75 and > or = 256 mg/L, respectively). This study indicates the increasing incidence, in Canada, of beta-lactamase resistance in H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis and penicillin resistance in S. pneumoniae.
