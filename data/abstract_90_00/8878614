The 8.0-kb macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B resistance plasmid pSES20 from Staphylococcus lentus harbored part of a Tn917-like transposon including the left terminal repeat, a gene almost identical to ermB, and its regulatory region, as well as the internal direct repeat. Homology between pSES20 and Tn917 ended at a sequence closely related to those of the resolution sites of Tn917 and Tn552 and staphylococcal recombination sites.
