The outer membrane protein contents of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium strains with PhoP/PhoQ regulon mutations were compared by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. At least 26 species of outer membrane proteins (OMPs) were identified as being regulated by PhoP/PhoQ activation. One PhoP/PhoQ-activated OMP was identified by semiautomated tandem mass spectrometry coupled with electronic database searching as PgtE, a member of the Escherichia coli OmpT and Yersinia pestis Pla family of outer membrane proteases. Salmonella PgtE expression promoted resistance to alpha-helical cationic antimicrobial peptides (alpha-CAMPs). Strains expressing PgtE cleaved C18G, an 18-residue alpha-CAMP present in culture medium, indicating that protease activity is likely to be the mechanism of OmpT-mediated resistance to alpha-CAMPs. PhoP/PhoQ did not regulate the transcription or export of PgtE, indicating that another PhoP/PhoQ-dependent mechanism is required for PgtE outer membrane localization. PgtE is a posttranscriptionally regulated component of the PhoP/PhoQ regulon that contributes to Salmonella resistance to innate immunity.
