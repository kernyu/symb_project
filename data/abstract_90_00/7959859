New findings on the molecular biology of plasmodia have led to new approaches for the development of chemotherapeutics. Trials to circumvent the relative toxicity of individual substances by a combination of active agents have been successful in several cases, and there will be more of those combinations in the future. An additional advantage of combinations can be the improvement of activity. In some cases, antiparasitic side effects of long known drugs with low toxicity such as imipramine can be used to decrease or overcome resistance. And, last but not least, ideas or in some cases new drugs will come from the traditional medicine.
