Among 6,068 strains of Staphylococcus epidermidis, 75.5% were oxacillin-resistant. Oxacillin-susceptible strains were more frequently susceptible to erythromycin, clindamycin, ciprofloxacin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, gentamicin, and tetracycline than oxacillin-resistant strains. With the exception of erythromycin, non-beta-lactam MICs were less discriminatory for identifying oxacillin-resistant strains with oxacillin MICs < or = 2 micrograms/ml than for those with oxacillin MICs > or = 4 micrograms/ml.
