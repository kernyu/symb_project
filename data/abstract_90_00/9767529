BACKGROUND: The immunosuppressive drugs cyclosporine A (CsA) and tacrolimus (FK506) are extruded from cells by the multidrug resistance P-glycoprotein (P-gp), an efflux pump for drugs and xenobiotics, which may limit their therapeutic effectiveness and/or incidence of toxic side effects. In the present study, we investigated the effect of therapeutic concentrations of CsA and FK506 on the expression of P-gp in cultured endothelial and proximal tubule cells. METHODS: P-gp expression in human arterial endothelial (HAEC) and rat proximal tubule cells (RPTC) was determined by immunoblotting and immunocytochemistry, and correlated with P-gp-mediated transport by measuring the intracellular accumulation of the fluorescent probe calcein. RESULTS: Following incubation of HAEC with therapeutic concentrations of 0.1 to 1.6 microM CsA up to seven days, P-gp expression increased in a time- and concentration-dependent manner, maximally to 291 +/- 42% of controls with 0.8 microM CsA for seven days. Similar effects of CsA were observed in RPTC. In contrast, therapeutic concentrations of FK506 (0.01 to 0.2 microM up to 7 days) did not change P-gp expression in either cell type, though at higher, supratherapeutic concentrations of FK506 (0.6 to 1.2 microM) P-gp expression was also increased. Immunocytochemistry revealed increased P-gp expression in the plasma membrane of HAEC and RPTC treated with 0.8 microM CsA, which was reflected by a decrease of P-gp-mediated accumulation of calcein in both cell types. CONCLUSIONS: The data suggest that the induction of P-gp expression in HAEC and RPTC at concentrations of CsA or FK506 above 0.5 microM is part of the protective answer of cells to toxic concentrations of the drugs and could therefore interfere with the therapeutic effectiveness of CsA in vivo.
