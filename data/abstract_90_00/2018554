Young animals are resistant to organophosphate-induced delayed polyneuropathy (OPIDP). The putative target protein in the nervous system for initiation of OPIDP in the adult hen is an enzyme called Neuropathy Target Esterase (NTE), which is dissected by selective inhibitors among nervous tissue esterases hydrolysing phenyl valerate (PV). We report here that the pool of PV-esterases sensitive to paraoxon was different in peripheral nerves of chicks as compared to that of hens while that of brain and spinal cord was not. NTE activity decreased with age in brain, spinal cord and peripheral nerve, but its sensitivity to several inhibitors remained unchanged. In the adult hen more than 70% inhibition of peripheral nerve NTE by neuropathic OPs is followed by deficit of retrograde axonal transport, axonal degeneration and paralysis. Similar NTE inhibition in 40-day-old or younger chicks however is not followed by changes in retrograde axonal transport nor by OPIDP. Chicks aged 60 to 80 days are only marginally sensitive to a single dose of DFP otherwise clearly neuropathic to hens. In vitro and in vivo phosphorylation by DFP and subsequent aging of brain NTE is similar both in chicks and in hens. The recovery of NTE activity monitored in vivo after inhibition by DFP is faster (half-life of about 3 days) in chick peripheral nerves as compared to chick brain, hen brain and hen peripheral nerve (half-life of about 5 days). It is concluded that the reduced sensitivity to OPIDP in chicks is not due to differences in OP-NTE interactions. The resistance might be explained by a more efficient repair mechanism, as suggested by the faster recovery of peripheral nerve NTE activity.
