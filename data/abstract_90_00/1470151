1444 cases if digestive tract surgery in our department were studied for the prevention of postoperative MRSA infections, during the period from September 1987 to February 1992. They were divided into nine stages each six months. There were no significant differences in incidence of postoperative MRSA infections, after some managements for hospital infection among each stage. We used the antibiotics as follows; the first generation of cefem families was used for the upper digestive tract operations and the second generation of cefem families was used for the lower digestive tract operation, and the incidence of postoperative MRSA infections were diminished significantly. This study showed that managements for hospital infections and appropriate selection of antibiotics for the purpose of postoperative prophylactic use are effective for the prevention of MRSA infections.
