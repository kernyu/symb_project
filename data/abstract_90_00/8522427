The fluoroquinolones have an established role in treatment of infection with aerobic gram negative rods. The increased importance of gram positive nosocomial infection and of acquired fluoroquinolone resistance has stimulated a search for new compounds with enhanced potency and spectrum. CP-99,219 is a novel compound in this class with enhanced activity against gram positive organisms. We have studied the activity of CP-99,219 relative to ciprofloxacin, fleroxacin, ofloxacin, and sparfloxacin using test panels of organisms with a high proportion of ciprofloxacin resistance. CP-99,219 is more potent than any of the other four compounds against both gram positive and gram negative bacteria. The activity of CP-99,219 against many bacteria resistant to the established agents, warrants further in vitro and clinical studies.
