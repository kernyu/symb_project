This survey to detect anthelmintic resistance in nematode parasites of sheep was conducted on 11 farms in the Occidental and 26 farms in the Oriental Regions of Paraguay using the faecal egg count reduction test (FECRT). The anthelmintic groups tested were the benzimidazoles, levamisole and avermectins (both oral and injectable). Overall the levels of resistance were 73%, 68%, 73% and 47%, respectively. Levels of resistance were similar for all three important nematode genera, viz. Haemonchus contortus, Ostertagia and Trichostrongylus. This survey clearly indicates that a large, and ever increasing, proportion of sheep farmers are rapidly approaching the time when they will have exhausted all chemotherapeutic options to control parasites. Unless they face having to abandon their sheep farming operations, radical changes will need to be implemented with urgency.
