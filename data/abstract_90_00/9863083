OBJECTIVE: To study the production mechanism of plasmodium berghei (PB) in resisting artesunate. METHODS: The combining quantity of Con A-binding sites on membrane surface of PB trophozoite labelled with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) of Con A was determined by fluoromicrospectrophotometer. RESULTS: The combining quantity of PB artesunate-resistance strain (PBAR) was reduced significantly than that of PB normal strain (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The type of glucose in surface membrane of PBAR has changed and the changes of membrane fluidity could be one of the causes of the change in the combining quantity of Con A-binding sites on membrane of PBAR.
