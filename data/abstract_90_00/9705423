Clarithromycin-susceptible and clarithromycin-resistant Helicobacter pylori isolates from the same patient were investigated for the mode of development and mechanism of clarithromycin resistance. The clarithromycin-resistant strain UA1182 harbors homozygous A-to-G mutations at position 2143 in both copies of the 23S rRNA gene and has a phenotype of resistance to clarithromycin and clindamycin but no significant resistance to streptogramin B. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns of NruI- and NotI-digested genomic DNA from the Clas and Clar isolates demonstrated that they are genetically distinct, suggesting that the development of clarithromycin resistance is not from the mutation of the existing Clas strain but from a completely new strain.
