Trichoderma pseudokoningii MTCC 3011 is a very useful strain for biological control of the plant pathogen Sclerotium rolfsii under post-harvest conditions. In the present investigation, several benomyl-tolerant phenotypic mutants of this strain have been generated using a two step mutagenesis-chemical followed by gamma irradiation. The mutants differed from the wild type strain in antibiotic and disease control potential. Some of the mutants are superior to the wild type in biocontrol potential on S. rolfsii.
