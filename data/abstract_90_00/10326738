Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a major problem as a multiresistant nosocomial pathogen, especially in burns and other immunocompromised patients in our hospital. The present prospective study, conducted between June 1996 and December 1997, was aimed at determining the extent of its resistance against highly active antipseudomonal drugs, such as carbapenems (imipenem and meropenem) and ureidopenicillin with beta-lactamase inhibitor (piperacillin/tazobactam); existence of any cross resistance or difference in susceptibility between imipenem and meropenem; and to compare the activity of piperacillin/tazobactam with the two carbapenems against P. aeruginosa. Of the 357 P. aeruginosa isolates tested from 188 patients 37 (10.4%) were resistant to imipenem, 21 (5.9%) to meropenem and 50 (14%) to piperacillin/tazobactam. Cross resistance between the two carbapenems was observed in 5.9% of the isolates. Sixteen (43%) of the imipenem-resistant isolates were susceptible to meropenem but the reverse was observed in none. Amongst the 50 piperacillin/tazobactam-resistant isolates cross resistance with the two carbapenems was observed in 18 (36%) and in 9 (18%) only with imipenem; 23 (46%) were susceptible to both. Our results indicate that P. aeruginosa is least resistant to meropenem followed by imipenem and piperacillin/tazobactam. Cross resistance between the carbapenems and between carbapenems and piperacillin/tazobactam was found. The study further suggests that burns, cardiac-neuro-pediatric surgical, cancer and transplant patients are more susceptible to acquiring infection due to multiresistant P. aeruginosa than other types of patients and common infection sites were wounds, respiratory tract, urine, blood and intravascular lines.
