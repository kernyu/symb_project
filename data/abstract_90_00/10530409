In 93 cases of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) the extent to which prognostic factors mirrored the in vitro cellular chemotherapy resistance (to anthracyclines aclarubicin (Acla) and daunorubicin (Dau) as well as nucleoside analogue cytarabine (Ara-C)) was investigated using a 4-d MTT (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) assay. We found that age at presentation and presence of secondary AML were significantly correlated to leukaemia cell Ara-C resistance. Thus, analysis of in vitro drug resistance data revealed that age at presentation and presence of secondary leukaemia were both independently correlated to cellular drug resistance, with older age being associated with higher Ara-C resistance in vitro (p=0.02 and 0.01 in univariate and multivariate analyses, respectively) and with secondary leukaemia being associated with higher Ara-C resistance (p=0.04 and 0.059 in univariate and multivariate analysis, respectively). Median LC-50 values (Ara-C) were: 178 ng/ml in paediatric cases, 356 ng/ml in younger adult cases, and 584 ng/ml in elderly (age > or = 60 yr) cases giving a resistance ratio between these age subgroups of 1:2.0:3.3. Median LC-50 values (Ara-C) was 381 ng/ml in de novo cases as opposed to 891 ng/ml (resistance ratio 1:2.3) in secondary cases. By contrast, cytogenetic findings, presenting leucocyte count, FAB-subtype, and gender were not consistently correlated to in vitro drug resistance to any of the three drugs. We conclude that at least two major adverse prognostic factors in AML (advanced age at presentation and presence of secondary leukaemia) are associated with increased leukaemia cell Ara-C resistance. High leucocyte count is not associated with increased cellular drug resistance towards Acla, Ara-C or Dau.
