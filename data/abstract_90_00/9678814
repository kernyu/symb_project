BACKGROUND: Experience with proton pump inhibitor-based triple therapy is predominantly with omeprazole-containing regimens. AIM: To investigate the efficacy of a pantoprazole-based regimen, with either a 1 or 2-week course of antibiotic co-therapy, in eradicating H. pylori, healing duodenal ulcers and to assess the antibiotic sensitivity profiles of isolated H. pylori strains. METHODS: A single-blind, multicentre, parallel group comparison of patients with endoscopically proven, H. pylori associated, active duodenal ulceration. All patients received pantoprazole, 40 mg b.d. for 2 weeks. Patients were randomized to receive either 1 or 2 weeks of therapy with amoxycillin, 1 g b.d. and clarithromycin 500 mg b.d. Patients were endoscoped at entry, at 14 days and a minimum of 4 weeks after cessation of all therapy. H. pylori status was determined by urease reaction, histological assessment and culture from antral and body biopsies. Antibiotic sensitivity was determined using the agar dilution technique. RESULTS: Sixty-seven patients were randomized. One week co-therapy (n=33): eradication efficacy, ITT= 79% (95% CI: 61-91%); ulcer healing efficacy (at 6-week visit)=88% (95% CI: 72-97%). Two-week co-therapy (n=34): eradication efficacy, ITT=91% (95% CI: 76-98%: ulcer healing efficacy= 88% (95% CI: 73-97%). Both regimens were well tolerated and no primary antibiotic resistance was noted. CONCLUSION: Pantoprazole-based triple therapy, with either 1 or 2 weeks of co-therapy with amoxycillin and clarithromycin, is effective in eradicating H. pylori and healing duodenal ulceration.
