Salmonella typhimurium has accounted for 29.43% of total Salmonella according to the surveillance in Fujian province since 1975. Seven common phagetypes of S. typhimurium were found. The principal phagetype was 7774, which accounted for 46.6% of all phagetypes. S. typhimurium was significantly more resistant to antibiotics in early 1990's than in the 1980's. 57%-72% of the S. typhimurium strains were resistant to aminoglycosides (except amikacin), about 70% were strains resistant to first generation penicillins and tetracyclins while a high proportion of S. typhimurium strains have rapidly become resistant to new broad-spectrum penicillins. The strains of S. typhimurium which are resistant to the first and the second generation of cephalothins become sensitive only to the third generation of cephalo thins. There has been 20% of S. typhimurium strains resistant to some types of quinolones. All S. typhimurium were sensitive to norfloxacin, ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin. In the early 1980's resistant strains to 2-3 kinds of antibiotics accounted for 97%, and nostrains was resistant to more then 6 kinds of antibiotics. In the early 1990's, the strain resistant to 2-3 kinds of antibiotics were less than 20%; while strains resistant to more than 10 kinds of antibiotics were 66%. The increasing rate of resistant strains to antibiotics with widening of drug resistant pattern and the extensive appearance of multiresistant strains have become serious problems to be solved.
