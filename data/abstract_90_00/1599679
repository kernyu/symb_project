The ability of the rabbit blastocyst to reduce nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) to formazan in the presence of cyanide was assayed as an indicator of extramitochondrial oxidase activity capable of generating the superoxide radical. A cytochemical method initially developed for the detection and localization of hydrogen peroxide production at the ultrastructural level in phagocytosing leukocytes (Briggs et al.: J Cell Biol 67:566, 1975) was also applied to the blastocyst. The results demonstrate that the rabbit blastocyst acquires the ability to reduce NBT by a cyanide-insensitive process and to generate hydrogen peroxide between the fourth and fifth days postcoitum. The enzymatic activity responsible is apparently an NAD(P)H-dependent oxidase in the outer, microvillous plasma membrane of the trophoblast.
