We examined the clinical efficacy of a combination of arbekacin and fosfomycin in the treatment of various methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections. The combination of arbekacin plus fosfomycin displayed 65.4% (17/26) clinical efficacy and 65.4% (17/26) bacteriological efficacy. This combination thus appeared to be an effective regimen for the treatment of MRSA infections. However, its bacteriological efficacy against concomitant Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains was only 16.7% (1/6). In addition, in 4 episodes of superinfection involving P. aeruginosa strains developed during the combination therapy.
