We evaluated the effects of a novel cephalosporin, cefclidin (CFCL) and imipenem (IPM), on the eradication of bacteria from the urine, bladder stones and the kidneys, and also on the prevention of the infection stone formations, in our polymicrobial urinary tract infection model of rats associated with bladder stones using IMP-sensitive or IPM-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis as a causative pathogen. CFCL completely eradicated P. mirabilis from the urine and the stone in the short-term regimen (5 days). CFCL completely eradicated both IPM-sensitive P. aeruginosa and P. mirabilis from the urine, the stones and the kidneys as compared to IPM in the long-term regimen (11 days), reflecting the superior antibacterial activity of CFCL. CFCL also significantly prevented the development of infection stones as compared to IPM in the long-term regimen. There was no significant difference in the blood urea nitrogen (BUN) values between the CFCL or IPM-treated and the non-treated groups. The cumulative recovery rate of unchanged CFCL reached 47.3% of the total dosage (20 mg/kg) within 8 hours.
