Infections caused by vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) are becoming increasingly prevalent throughout the world. Control measures include detection and isolation of carriers of VRE. A selective medium to detect faecal carriage of VRE is described. The medium has a high productivity ratio (90.4%) for VRE with VanA resistance phenotype, a moderate productivity ratio (79.2%) for VRE with VanB resistance phenotype, and a relatively low productivity ratio (65.5%) for VRE with VanC resistance phenotype. There was no breakthrough of vancomycin-susceptible enterococci. The medium selected the growth of all three types of VRE, which were used to spike faecal specimens. In a limited clinical trial, six faecal specimens of carriers and contacts were screened using the selective medium. Vancomycin-resistant enterococci (Enterococcus faecalis, VanA phenotype) were detected in four of the specimens. In all four specimens the growth of VRE was nearly pure and easily identifiable.
