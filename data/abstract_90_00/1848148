Nosocomial infection may cause severe diseases and is sometimes life-threatening. Such infection may be caused by different bacteria strains, but in our pediatric ward, a large number of cases are infected by E. coli. We studied the cases hospitalized during the period from January 1986 to December 1988 in pediatric ward, sick baby room, baby room or intensive care unit. The most common microorganism of nosocomial infection was found to be Staphylococcus aureus (37 strains), followed by E. coli (32 strains). However, bacteremia, was more often caused by E. coli (13 strains) than by Staphylococcus aureus (4 strains). In patients with E. coli nosocomial infection the ratio of male to female was 2:1. Of them, 87.5% were below 1 month old, and 6.25% were from 1 month to 1 year or from 5 to 10 years of age. The antibiotics sensitivity in bacteremia strains of E. coli seemed to be the same as that in non-bacteremia strains. Both of them were less sensitive to aminoglycoside than the community-acquired strains. Their sensitivity to 3rd-generation cephalosporins was 100%.
