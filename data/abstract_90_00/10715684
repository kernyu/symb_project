Pregnant women infected with malarial parasites have an increased risk of maternal anaemia, abortion, stillbirth, prematurity, intra-uterine growth retardation, and infants of low birthweight. A 'state-of-the-art' symposium on malaria in pregnancy was convened in Kisumu, Kenya, in November 1997, to discuss the biological and clinical impact of malaria in pregnancy, and to identify antimalarial drugs and control strategies to protect pregnant women. The deleterious effects of malarial infection during pregnancy were shown to be associated both with Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax infections, and to occur under a wide range of malaria transmission pressures. Control interventions, thus, need to be targeted at pregnant women in all endemic areas. Alternative antimalarial drugs to chloroquine have been tested and shown to be effective (and safe) against malaria in pregnancy. Delivery of cost-effective control interventions has been explored; investments are needed to facilitate the scaling-up of successful approaches to national-programme level. Several important research questions related to malaria in pregnancy were highlighted at the Kisumu meeting. Increased international and local commitment, to resource effective malaria control in pregnancy adequately, is a public-health priority.
