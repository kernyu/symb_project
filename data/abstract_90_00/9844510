During the last decade antimicrobial resistant pathogens have become a major medical problem. Internationally, multiresistant enterococci have increased nosocomial morbidity and mortality. Such strains are often resistant to ampicillin, aminoglycosides, and glycopeptides such as vancomycin. The spread of these strains has been shown to correlate to the use of antibiotics and the practice of suboptimal infection control within health care facilities. The current situation in Norwegian hospitals is presented, including the only six cases with infections and the three carriers of vancomycin resistant enterococci found to date. Surveillance in the hospitals shows that such strains are uncommon in non-infected patients. To maintain this favourable situation it is necessary to continue to practice effective methods of infection control and to employ sound antibiotic policies.
