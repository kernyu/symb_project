We previously demonstrated stable integration of a transduced thymidine kinase (TK)-neo gene into immature and replatable stem and progenitor cells, as assessed by the presence of the gene in second-generation colonies. To evaluate whether this integration was still present in third- and fourth-generation colonies, nonadherent low-density T-lymphocyte-depleted (NALT-) cells from human umbilical cord blood were prestimulated with recombinant human (rhu) erythropoietin (Epo), steel factor (SLF), interleukin-3 (IL-3), granulocyte-macrophage (GM) colony-stimulating factor (CSF), and granulocyte (G)-CSF. Prestimulated NALT- cells were incubated with retroviral-containing supernatant obtained from TK-neo vector-producing cells, washed, and assayed for colony formation in the presence of Epo, SLF, IL-3, GM-CSF, and G-CSF -/+ G418. The results confirmed that the TK-neo gene could be efficiently introduced into hematopoietic progenitor cells without stromal cells as a source of virus. As previously reported, proviral integration was detected in primary G418R-colonies, and in second-generation replated colonies derived from G418R granulocyte erythroid macrophage megakaryocyte colony-forming units and high-proliferative potential colony-forming cells (HPP-CFCs). Moreover, we now document that proviral integration was apparent in cells from colonies derived from third- and fourth-generation replated HPP-CFC, suggesting a high degree of stable integration of the transduced gene.
