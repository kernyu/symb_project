BACKGROUND: Effective antimicrobial therapy can reduce the duration and volume of cholera diarrhoea by half. However, such treatment is currently limited by Vibrio cholerae resistance to the drugs commonly prescribed for cholera, and by the difficulties involved in the administration of multi-drug doses under field conditions. Because of its favourable pharmacokinetics we thought it likely that single-dose ciprofloxacin would be effective in the treatment of cholera. METHODS: In this double-blind study treatment was either a single 1 g oral dose of ciprofloxacin plus doxycycline placebo, or a single 300 mg oral dose of doxycycline plus ciprofloxacine placebo. 130 moderately or severely dehydrated men infected with V cholerae 01 and 130 infected with V cholerae 0139 were randomly assigned treatment. Patients stayed in hospital for 5 days. We measured fluid intake and stool volume every 6 h, and a sample of stool for culture was obtained daily. The primary outcome measures were clinical success--the cessation of watery stool within 48 h; and bacteriological success--absence of V cholerae from cultures of stool after study day 2. FINDINGS: Among patients infected with V cholerae 01, treatment was clinically successful in 62 (94%) of 66 patients who received ciprofloxacin and in 47 (73%) of 64 who receive doxycycline (difference 21% [95% Cl 8-33]); the corresponding proportions with bacteriological success were 63 (95%) and 44 (69%) (27% [14-39]). Among patients infected with V cholerae 0139, treatment was clinically successful in 54 (92%) of 59 patients who received ciprofloxacin and in 65 (92%) of 71 who received doxycycline (< 1% [-9 to 9]), and bacteriologically successful in 58 (98%) and 56 (79%), respectively (19% [9-30]). Total volume of watery stool did not differ significantly between ciprofloxacin-group and doxycycline-group patients infected with either V cholerae 01 or 0139. All but one of the V cholerae 01 and all of the 0139 isolates were susceptible in vitro to doxycycline, whereas 48 (37%) of the V cholerae 01 isolates and none of the 0139 isolates were resistant to tetracycline. Treatment clinically failed in 14 (52%) of 27 doxycycline-treated patients infected with a tetracycline-resistant V cholerae 01 strain, compared with three (8%) of 37 patients infected with a tetracycline-susceptible strain (44% [23-65]). INTERPRETATION: Single-dose ciprofloxacin is effective in the treatment of cholera caused by V cholerae 01 or 0139 and is better than single-dose doxycycline in the eradication of V cholerae from stool. Single-dose ciprofloxacin may also be the preferred treatment in areas where tetracycline-resistant V cholerae are common. In V cholerae, in-vitro doxycycline susceptibilities are not a useful indicator of the in-vivo efficacy of the drug.
