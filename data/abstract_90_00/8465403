We have carried out a retrospective study on 100 children in hospital in Marseilles, France with a diagnosis of Plasmodium falciparum malaria. On admission, the main clinical features were anaemia (90 cases), fever (83 cases, > 40 degrees C in 22 cases), hepatomegaly (44 cases), vomiting (29 cases), neurological signs (22 cases), thrombocytopenia (13 cases), hyperparasitaemia (6 cases), jaundice (4 cases), shock (1 case) and hypoglycaemia (1 case). Severe malaria, as defined by the World Health Organization Malaria Action Programme, was rare in our study (only 2 cases) and the prognosis was good (no death, no sequela). The search for neurological signs such as impaired consciousness, prostration or convulsions is an effective and simple way to diagnose potentially severe cases. In the presence of these signs, intravenous quinine treatment resulted in a shortened duration of fever (30 h instead of 63 h) and thereby avoided patients becoming worse. In children without neurological signs or persistent vomiting, oral therapy may be used even if there is high fever or hyperparasitaemia, but close surveillance is required. Patients treated with halofantrine or mefloquine had a shorter stay in hospital than those treated with chloroquine (mean = 4 d instead of 5.7 d). The resistance of some strains to chloroquine may explain this difference.
