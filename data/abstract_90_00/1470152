During two years of 1990 and 1991, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains were isolated from 121 patients who were admitted to our emergency ward with infection rate of 7% (121/1843). The end results were miserable and the mortality rate was 28%. The infection rate was significantly higher than that of general surgical ward (2%). Specimens of respiratory tract such as coughed-up sputum and tracheal secretion showed high rate of MRSA isolation, especially in patients who underwent tracheal intubation or tracheostomy. All of these MRSA strains were strongly resistant to antibiotics and were typed as coagulase II. MRSA strains were isolated from nostril of medical staff and in-ward patients while admission with rate of 9% and 3%, respectively. Meanwhile, the MRSA strains were also isolated from the materials surrounding the infected patients such as bed, door, gowns and hands of in-charge nurses. To prevent inter-patient transmission, the infected patients were placed in isolation room and cared with isolation technique. Handwashing with benzalkonium chloride-alcohol is strongly recommended. Intravenous injection of IPM and CEZ or VCM is indicated. Local use of MINO was reported to be useful. In conclusion, MRSA infection often occurs in the immunodepressive patients and is hard to cure.
