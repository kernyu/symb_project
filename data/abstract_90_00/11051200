A correlation is known to exist in yeast and other organisms between the cellular resistance to stress and the life span. The aim of this study was to examine whether stress treatment does affect the generative life span of yeast cells. Both heat shock (38 degrees C, 30 min) and osmotic stress (0.3 M NaCl, 1 h) applied cyclically were found to increase the mean and maximum life span of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Both effects were more pronounced in superoxide dismutase-deficient yeast strains (up to 50% prolongation of mean life span and up to 30% prolongation of maximum life span) than in their wild-type counterparts. These data point to the importance of the antioxidant barrier in the stress-induced prolongation of yeast life span.
