Transmitted resistance to recent cephalosporin antibiotics of the third generation was first proved in 1983 by the authors. Approximately five years later the authors revealed during systematic monitoring of bacterial strains resistant to cephtazidime, cephtriaxone and cephotaxim also transmitted resistance to these and other more recent beta-lactam antibiotics in Czechoslovakia. The authors advocate rational use of new cephalosporins and other beta-lactams (e. g. aztreonam) as reserve antibiotics.
