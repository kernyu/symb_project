This article summarizes informations regarding epidemiology, prophylaxis and treatment of Plasmodium falciparum malaria in pregnant women and children in subsaharian Africa. The authors recommend a regular antimalarial chemoprophylaxis using chloroquine and proguanil for pregnant women and particularly for primigravidae as they constitute a group at risk and considering the consequential effects on foetus. Precautions such as bed nets to avoid bites by infected mosquitoes are important. Chloroquine is the drug of choice for treatment in areas where P. falciparum remains sensitive. When chloroquine resistance exists or in cases of severe malariae, quinine must be used.
