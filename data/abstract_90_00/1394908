The asexual stages of P. berghei ANKA were completely eliminated as revealed in a "4-day suppressive test" with the daily dose of pyronaridine 12.5 mg base/kg or amodiaquine 25 mg base/kg. Mefloquine 25 mg base/kg and qinghaosu 100 mg/kg though exerted obvious suppressive effect, the cure rates were only 50% and 0%, respectively. In treating chloroquine-sensitive P. berghei ANKA strain pyronaridine exhibited the best therapeutic activity, which was followed by amodiaquine, mefloquine and quinghaosu. In treating moderately chloroquine-resistant P. berghei NS line the cure rate of pyronaridine 12.5 mg/kg.d x 4 was 70%, but none of the 10 infected mice from any group was cured by amodiaquine 100 mg/kg.d, mefloquine 100 mg/kg.d or qinghaosu 200 mg/kg.d. Though the latter 3 drugs showed prominent suppressive effects, parasitemia remained positive or recrudesced after dosing. We demonstrate that parasites resistant to chloroquine had cross resistance to amodiaquine, mefloquine and inghaosu at various degrees. Amodiaquine 100 mg/kg.d, mefloquine 100 mg/kg.d and qinghaosu 200 mg/kg.d exhibited no obvious suppressive activity on highly pyronaridine-resistant line of P. berghei, indicating the existence of cross resistance to pyronaridine.
