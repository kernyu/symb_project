A comparative study of surface membranes of human cell J-96 and J-48 cultures with different sensitivity to alpha/beta interferon (IF). Reduced sensitivity of J-41 cells to IF-alpha/beta was found to be accompanied by a loss of highly specific receptors for IF-alpha, the lack of changes in the cell surface structures upon treatment with IF-alpha/beta, reduced intensity of cell fusion upon successive treatment with IF and polyethylene glycol. The results are discussed in connection with the observed changes in the activity of superoxide dismutase in J-96 and J-41 cell lines after treatment with IF.
