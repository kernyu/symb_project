Septic complications remain important in obstetrical surgery due to the serious threat they pose to life and the sequelae which they may leave. The authors have therefore attempted to identify which of the anti-infectious prophylactic treatments used in cesareans were the most effective. This analysis was based on cases in their unit seen from 1984 to 1988 and on a review of the literature. Of the patients who underwent a cesarean (9.4 percent out of 7,855 deliveries), 2 percent were infected, with and incidence of 0.65 percent serious infections (0.4 percent septicemia). On the basis of the literature, the following risk factors were identified: 1st cesarean, cesarean during labor, rupture of the membranes, surgical problem, anemia, obesity and low socio-economic level. The local fundamental and systemic prophylactic measures taken were special antibiotic prophylaxis in the patients with a risk of infection only. The short protocol, with a single injection of penicillin A or a first generation cephalosporin, after clamping the umbilical was preferable and, according to all the studies, had the advantage of avoiding the selection of resistance.
