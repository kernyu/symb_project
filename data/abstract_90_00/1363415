Four strains of Bacillus sphaericus, 1593, 2362, 9001 and 9002, B. thuringiensis H-14 and B. thuringiensis neoleonensis were tested for sensitivity against 18 antibiotics. The results revealed that all the four strains of B. sphaericus are resistant to colistin, nalidixic acid, polymyxin B and streptomycin. However, B. thuringiensis H-14 was resistant to 9 antibiotics, viz. ampicillin, cephalexin, carbenicillin, co-trimoxazole, colistin, cloxacillin, penicillin, nitrofurantoin and polymyxin B whereas B. thuringiensis neoleonensis was found to be resistant to 8 antibiotics. These results may help in isolation of potential and resistant mosquito pathogenic bacteria.
