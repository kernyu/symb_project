Seven clonal sublines of the strain of syrian hamster embryo cells transformed in vitro by the Rous sarcoma virus were obtained. All clones possessed both high resistance to damage by hydrogen peroxide and a capacity to release E-type prostaglandins in response to contact with NK-cells in vitro. The clones did not differ from each other and from the parent population in respect to these qualitative properties. Possible relation between these two properties and their role in resistance of transformed cells to cytotoxic activity of macrophages, neutrophils and NK-cells and thus to their ability to survive in vivo are discussed.
