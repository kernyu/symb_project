Recent increases in fungal infections, the few available antifungal drugs, and increasing fungal resistance to the available antifungal drugs have resulted in a broadening of the search for new antifungal agents. Strains of Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae produce cyclic lipodepsinonapeptides with antifungal activity. The in vitro antifungal and fungicidal activities of three cyclic lipodepsinonapeptides (syringomycin E, syringotoxin B, and syringostatin A) against medically important isolates were evaluated by a standard broth microdilution susceptibility method. Erythrocyte toxicities were also evaluated. All three compounds showed broad antifungal activities and fungicidal actions against most of the fungi tested. Overall, the cyclic lipodepsinonapeptides were more effective against yeasts than against the filamentous fungi. Syringomycin E and syringostatin A had very similar antifungal activities (2.5 to > 40 micrograms/ml) and erythrocyte toxicities. Syringotoxin B was generally less active (0.8 to 200 micrograms/ml) than syringomycin E and syringostatin A against most fungi and was less toxic to erythrocytes. With opportunities for modification, these compounds are potential lead compounds for improved antifungal agents.
