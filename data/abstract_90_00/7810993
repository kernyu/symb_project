Erythromycin, new macrolides, and quinolones are alternatives for the treatment of Campylobacter infections. Concerns related to the emergence of resistance to both groups of drugs have been raised. We studied the evolution of antimicrobial susceptibilities of 275 clinical isolates of microorganisms of the genus Campylobacter isolated in our institution during a 5-year period (1988 to 1992). The microorganisms studied were C. jejuni (n = 230), C. coli (n = 42), and C. fetus (n = 3). The overall resistance rates (determined by the agar dilution method and the recommendations of the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards) were as follows: erythromycin, 2.3%; clarithromycin, 2.3%; azithromycin, 1.9%; ciprofloxacin, 28.5%; norfloxacin, 31%; ofloxacin, 26.3%; and nalidixic acid, 36.8%. The evolution of resistance (percent resistance in 1988 versus percent resistance in 1992) was as follows: erythromycin, 2.6 versus 3.1; clarithromycin, 2.6 versus 3.1; azithromycin, 2.6 versus 3.1; ciprofloxacin, 0 versus 49.5; norfloxacin, 2.6 versus 55.5; ofloxacin, 0 versus 45.6; nalidixic acid, 2.6 versus 56.8. Our data show stable macrolide activity against Campylobacter spp. and the rapid development of quinolone resistance over the last 5 years.
