Multiple drug resistant Salmonella typhi infection was observed in thirty five recent cases among forty eight children with bacteriologically proven enteric fever. Incidence of complications such as shock, myocarditis, encephalopathy and paralytic ileus was higher among these. A combination of cephalexin and gentamicin was successfully used in the management of these children.
