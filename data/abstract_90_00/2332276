An in vitro assay was used to determine efficacy and if side resistance was present to benzimidazole anthelmintics tested against Caenorhabditis elegans after selection with albendazole. Side resistance was present to all the benzimidazoles tested, except for oxibendazole and parbendazole. At a concentration of 1 mM, all of the drugs, except thiabendazole, were effective in killing 100% of the albendazole susceptible worms. Tubulin from albendazole resistant and susceptible C. elegans was isolated and run on polyacrylamide gels. Western blots with anti-tubulin antibody showed that the albendazole resistant strain had an altered tubulin. Electron microscopy of albendazole-treated drug resistant worms showed microtubules throughout the intestinal cells. Microtubules were not observed in albendazole-treated drug susceptible worms.
