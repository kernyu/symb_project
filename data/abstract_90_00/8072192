The clinical efficacy of a new aminoglycoside antibiotic, arbekacin (ABK), was studied in surgical patients who had been infected with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Six cases of pneumonia, 2 of wound infections and 2 of intra-abdominal infections were treated by ABK alone or ABK together with beta-lactam antibiotics such as imipenem/cilastatin or cefotiam. The overall clinical efficacies against these MRSA infections were excellent in one case, good in 6 and poor in 3. In six cases treated by ABK alone, good clinical responses were obtained in 4 cases. Among 4 cases that received combination therapy with ABK, good responses were obtained in 3 cases. No adverse reactions were found in ABK monotherapy or in combined therapy. These data suggested that ABK is an effective antibiotic on surgical infections caused by MRSA.
