BMS-181184 is a water-soluble derivative of the pradimicin group of antifungal compounds. We determined the in vitro activities of BMS-181184 and comparator agents amphotericin B, 5-fluorocytosine, fluconazole, and ketoconazole against 184 systemic fungal isolates collected at the Health Sciences Centre in Winnipeg, Canada, between 1987 and 1995. BMS-181184 demonstrated MICs of between 1 and 8 micrograms/mL for all Candida albicans, Candida glabrata, Candida tropicalis, Candida krusei, Candida lusitaniae, and Cryptococcus neoformans isolates tested. BMS-181184 was less active against Candida parapsilosis (MIC90 = 16 micrograms/mL) and Blastomyces dermatitidis (MIC90 = 32 micrograms/mL). Isolates of Candida species with fluconazole MICs of > or = 16 micrograms/mL and those with fluconazole MICs of < or = 8 micrograms/mL demonstrated similar BMS-181184 sensitivities.
