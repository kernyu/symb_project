Most antitumor agents exert their cytotoxic effect through the induction of apoptosis, and this process may be mediated through an elevation in p53 protein, with a subsequent increase in bax and decrease in bcl-2. p53 also increases mdm-2 expression and mdm-2 may then bind and inactivate p53. Cells from 31 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) were treated in vitro with 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine (CdA), arabinosyl-2-fluoroadenine (F-ara-A), or chlorambucil (CLB) and drug sensitivity measured using the MTT assay. The protein levels of bax and bcl-2 were measured in CLL cells from 25 patients, and were found to be higher in leukemic cells than in normal B cells. The bcl-2 levels varied three-fold, the bax levels fifteen-fold, and the bax:bcl-2 ratios ranged from 0.44 to 2.91. The expression of mdm-2 mRNA was measured in CLL cells from 28 patients and was found to vary twenty-fold. However, no correlation was observed between drug sensitivity to CdA, F-ara-A, or CLB and the cellular levels of mdm-2 mRNA, or the protein levels of bax or bcl-2, or the bax:bcl-2 ratio. Treatment of CLL cells having wild type p53 with CdA, F-ara-A or CLB produced an increase in p53 protein and mdm-2 mRNA. This was not observed in cells having a p53 mutation, and these cells were highly resistant to both CLB and the nucleoside analogs. In contrast to the nucleoside analogs and CLB, dexamethasone and vincristine had no effect on mdm-2 mRNA levels. Treatment of CLL cells containing a wild type p53 gene with CdA, F-ara-A, or CLB, did not produce any consistent changes in bax or bcl-2. Thus, CdA, F-ara-A and CLB appear to act in CLL cells through a p53-dependent pathway, whereas this does not occur with dexamethasone or vincristine. The cellular levels of mdm-2, bcl-2, bax or the bax:bcl-2 ratios are not predictive indicators of clinical sensitivity in CLL, but an increase in mdm-2 levels after drug treatment is indicative of p53 function in these cells.
