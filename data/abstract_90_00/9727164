Antibiotic susceptibility of the circulating beta-hemolytic streptococci of serogroups A, B, C and G isolated from healthy and sick children and adults within 1987-1996 (more than 900 cultures) was studied. It was shown that the MICs of betalactam antibiotics did not change (within the susceptibility levels) with respect to the serogroup A, C and G streptococci. The number of the strains resistant to erythromycin and lincomycin increased the same as the frequency of the strains simultaneously resistant to chloramphenicol, tetracycline and gentamicin. Tomicid and solkarmon, drugs alternative to antibiotics, were found to be active against the above streptococci groups and efficient in the treatment and prophylaxis of streptococcoses. A suggestion that betalactams are not safe in the treatment of the toxic shock syndrome due to the group A streptococci is discussed.
