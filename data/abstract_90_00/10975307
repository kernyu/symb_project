In primary focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) renal prognosis is poor if no remission of proteinuria can be achieved with treatment. Currently, most children with FSGS are treated with cyclosporine and steroids after establishing steroid resistance, and approximately 60% of patients benefit from this therapy. For the remaining 40%, no generally approved therapeutic recommendations exist for children. We treated nine children with cyclosporine-resistant primary FSGS with plasma exchange (PE), two with relapsing FSGS after renal transplantation and seven with FSGS in their native kidneys. Three patients did not respond to PE, but five came into complete remission and one patient achieved partial remission. Three patients relapsed between 6 weeks and 2 years following cessation of PE, and were subsequently treated with plasma immunadsorption (PIA), which also reliably reduced proteinuria. The patients without response to PE tended to have a longer duration of the disease. We conclude that PE and PIA are a useful option for treatment of steroid- and cyclosporine-resistant FSGS, particularly if applied early in the course of the disease. Although more demanding on supportive resources, PIA seems preferable to PE, since there is no necessity for additional albumin or fresh-frozen plasma, as with PE.
