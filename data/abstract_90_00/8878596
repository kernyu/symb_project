The in vitro activity of the trinem sanfetrinem (formerly GV104326) (GV) was compared with that of vancomycin, ampicillin, and/or nafcillin against 287 gram-positive bacteria, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and multiresistant enterococci, by the agar and microbroth dilution methods. GV demonstrated 2 to 16 times more activity than ampicillin and nafcillin against the majority of these organisms. The MIC range of GV was 16 to 64 micrograms/ml for 19 Enterococcus faecium strains that were highly resistant to ampicillin (ampicillin MIC range, 64 to 512 micrograms/ml) and vancomycin resistant and 0.25 to 32 micrograms/ml for resistant Rhodococcus spp. Similar activities (+/-1 dilution) were observed by either the agar or the broth microdilution method. GV demonstrated bactericidal activity against a beta-lactamase-producing Enterococcus faecalis strain and against two methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus strains in 10(5)-CFU/ml inocula. Synergy between GV and gentamicin was observed against an E. faecalis strain that lacked high-level gentamicin resistance. The activity of GV suggests this compound warrants further study.
