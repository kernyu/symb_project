The effects of chronic ethanol feeding on lipid composition of rat liver plasma membrane were studied by following ethanol loading or its withdrawal in vivo. Male Wistar rats were pair-fed by a liquid diet containing ethanol as 36% of energy or an isocarolic amounts of glucose for 6 weeks. Chronic ethanol feeding resulted in an increase of cholesterol content and the cholesterol/phospholipid molar ratio in liver plasma membrane compared with pair-fed control rats. Acute ethanol (3 g/kg body weight) orally loading to rats fed ethanol chronically did not change any lipid composition of liver plasma membrane. However, withdrawal of ethanol for 2 days led cholesterol content and the cholesterol/phospholipid molar ratio of liver plasma membrane to be normal values. These data indicated that chronic ethanol feeding produced membrane alterlation that induced resistance to ethanol-induced membrane structural disordering (membrane tolerance), and that this alterlation resulted in a homeoviscous adaptation of liver plasma membrane.
