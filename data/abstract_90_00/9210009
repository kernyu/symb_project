Two seriously neutropenic patients (a 23-year-old man with a promyelocytic acute myeloid leukemia [AML-M3] and a 77-year old male with an immature acute myeloid leukemia [AML-M1] diagnosis) with severe infections caused by Stenotrophomonas maltophilia were treated with aztreonam/clavulanic acid (2:1) combination. In the first patient the infection was caused by a multiresistant strain and in the second, by a strain with poor response to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and other antimicrobial agents. After treatment with aztreonam/clavulanic acid both patients evolved favorably.
