As antimicrobial resistance to tried-and-true drugs continues to build, an arsenal of new drugs aimed at resistant respiratory tract pathogens is needed. Penicillin is now ineffective against several common pathogens, including many pneumococcal organisms. Newer antimicrobials, including macrolides, cephalosporins, and fluoroquinolones, have been developed to take its place. The authors of this article present a progress report of the fight against respiratory tract infection and an assessment of the most promising newer agents for use against multidrug-resistant pathogens.
