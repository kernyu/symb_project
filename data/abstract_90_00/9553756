BetaTC6-F7 cells like normal Beta cells were found to be highly sensitive to hydrogen peroxide and to possess very low levels of catalase. Therefore we tested whether overexpression of catalase could enhance resistance to hydrogen peroxide. Enzyme activity was increased forty fold by transient transfection of a catalase transgene. To assess protection from hydrogen peroxide a cotransfection method using a human growth hormone reporter gene was developed. Human growth hormone secretion was shown to be a suitable marker for insulin secretion since both hormones demonstrated virtually identical glucose dose response curves. Catalase transfection was found to provide significant protection against hydrogen peroxide indicating that low catalase may contribute to the sensitivity of cells to hydrogen peroxide.
