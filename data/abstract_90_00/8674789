The in vitro susceptibility of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) to nadifloxacin and seven other fluoroquinolones (norfloxacin, ofloxacin, enoxacin, ciprofloxacin, lomefloxacin, tosufloxacin and sparfloxacin) was evaluated. The MRSA isolates were isolated from 114 skin infections between 1991 and 1994. Nadifloxacin exhibited the lowest minimum inhibitory concentration and there were no MRSA isolates resistant to nadifloxacin, while there were some resistant to all of the other seven fluoroquinolones. The minimum concentrations of these drugs needed to cause 50% inhibition of the isolates increased dramatically from 1991 to 1992, but has hardly changed since 1992.
