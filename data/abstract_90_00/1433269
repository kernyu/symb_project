We studied a single round of replication of Simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) through the use of a replication defective vector that expresses the hygromycin resistance gene. It was possible to pseudotype SIV particles by complementation with the env gene from a murine amphotropic retrovirus. Moreover, SIV RNA was packaged and propagated by core particles of the heterologous lentivirus, HIV-1. These results indicate that coinfection of cells with SIV and other retroviruses could lead to infection of new cell types in nature.
