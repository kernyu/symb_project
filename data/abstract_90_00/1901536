The in vitro activity of ceftibuten, a new orally administered cephalosporin, was assessed against clinical isolates of Haemophilus influenzae and Branhamella catarrhalis. The activity of ceftibuten was compared to that of ampicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, and three oral cephalosporins, cefaclor, cefuroxime, and cefixime. With the exception of rare beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant strains of H. influenzae, resistance to ceftibuten was not observed with any of the study isolates. Ceftibuten was more active than amoxicillin/clavulanic acid for beta-lactamase-positive and -negative strains of H. influenzae; it was less active than this combination for B. catarrhalis. Ceftibuten was essentially equivalent in activity to cefixime against both Haemophilus and Branhamella but more active than cefaclor and cefuroxime against these two organisms.
