The management of patients with acute leukaemia is often complicated by serious fungal infections, especially of the lungs. The outcome of therapy has historically depended on the early use, efficacy and toxicity of amphotericin B. Pseudoallescheria boydii is an uncommon cause of such infections but as it is more often resistant to amphotericin B early identification may enable the prompt use of alternative and newer antifungal agents. Here we report our experience and review the literature in three cases of P. boydii infection in patients with leukemia, showing unique features such as childhood and central nervous system disease, positive blood cultures and response to itraconazole.
