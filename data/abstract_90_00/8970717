AIM: To review Track B on clinical science. Major topics covered were quantitative HIV-1 plasma RNA measurement, combination antiretroviral therapy, protease inhibitors, treatment of primary HIV-1 infection, HIV-1 drug resistance, future use of antiretroviral drugs, paediatric HIV-1 infection, opportunistic infections and HIV/AIDS in developing countries. QUANTITATIVE HIV-1 PLASMA RNA MEASUREMENT: Quantification of HIV-1 RNA is a predictor of progression of immune deficiency and death in HIV-infected adults and children, and is useful in monitoring response to antiretroviral therapy. THERAPY: Combination antiretroviral therapy is now the standard of care, although questions about optimal starting time and the best initial regimen remain unresolved. Protease inhibitors are a powerful new class of antiretroviral agents which in combination with other drugs can produce profound reductions in plasma HIV-1 RNA levels. Trials are in progress of combination antiretroviral therapy, including protease inhibitors, in persons recently infected with HIV-1 to assess the feasibility of permanent suppression or eradication of HIV-1. Adherence to therapy and drug resistance will become increasingly important subjects. CONCLUSIONS: The genuine improvements in patient management are out of reach to the majority of the world's HIV-infected persons, a conclusion with implications which dampened the optimism generated by the conference.
