Carnobacterium piscicola LV17 isolated from vacuum-packed meat produces bacteriocin(s) that is active against closely related lactic acid bacteria, Enterococcus spp., and a strain of Listeria monocytogenes but not against gram-negative bacteria. The bacteriocin has a bactericidal mode of action, is heat resistant, and is stable over a wide range of pH but is inactivated by proteolytic enzymes. Sensitive and resistant cells were shown to adsorb the bacteriocin, but cell death depended on contact of the bacteriocin with the cell membrane. Bacteriocin production is detected early in the growth cycle of the organism in APT broth, but it is not produced in APT broth adjusted to pH 5.5. Bacteriocin production and resistance to the bacteriocin produced are associated with two plasmids of 40 and 49 megadaltons. The possibility that two bacteriocins are produced is indicated because the inhibitory substances of the mutant strains containing either the 40- or 49-megadalton plasmids have different antimicrobial spectra.
