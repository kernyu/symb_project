The objective of this study is to compare the results of treatment of children with falciparum malaria with the combinations of fansidar-sulphate quinine and fansidar-chlortetracycline as an alternative treatment of chloroquine resistant falciparum malaria. This study was carried out prospectively on 45 cases with the age equal or above 7 years, who had been admitted in the Pediatric Department, Gunung Wenang Hospital Manado during the period of January 1989-December 1989. Twenty three cases had been treated with fansidar-sulphate quinine and 22 cases with fansidar-chlortetracycline, all of them underwent blood examinations for malaria for 7 consecutive days (day 0-8). Asexual parasitemia and fever in the fansidar-sulphate quinine group significantly disappeared more rapidly than in the fansidar-chlortetracycline group (p less than 0.03 and less than 0.005). There occurred neither drug resistance nor serious side effect in both groups.
