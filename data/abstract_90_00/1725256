The present study shows that a mutation in the 530 loop of 16S rRNA impairs the binding of streptomycin to the bacterial ribosome, thereby restricting the misreading effect of the drug. Previous reports demonstrated that proteins S4, S5 and S12 as well as the 915 region of 16S rRNA are involved in the binding of streptomycin, and indicated that the drug not only interacts with the 30S subunit but also with the 50S subunit. The relationship between the target of streptomycin and its known interference with the proofreading control of translational accuracy is examined in light of these results.
