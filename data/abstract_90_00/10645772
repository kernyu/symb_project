In this study, we assessed the efficiency of T lymphocyte transduction with a retroviral vector carrying the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV-tk) and neomycin phosphotransferase (neo) genes by four different protocols: standard supernatant infection, supernatant infection plus centrifugation steps, supernatant infection on fibronectin fragment-coated wells, and cocultivation. After retrovirus-mediated gene transfer of tk-neo in PHA/IL-2-stimulated primary T lymphocytes and G418 selection, T cells retained their proliferative activity, alloresponsiveness, ability to produce and to respond to IL-2, and ganciclovir (gcv)-specific sensitivity. When the four different transduction techniques were compared, no significant differences were seen in terms of cellular viability, proliferation capacity, and immunophenotyping. tk gene expression was the same in all transduced selected populations, as indicated by gcv sensitivity. Transduction efficiency was evaluated by semiquantitative PCR. Using the standard supernatant infection method, the rate of infection was extremely low (<5%). After adding the centrifugation step or performing supernatant infection on fibronectin fragment-coated wells, PCR analysis showed a 30%-40% rate of transduced cells. After infection by cocultivation, the rate of transduced cells was 30%-40%. These results demonstrate that supernatant infection plus centrifugation, supernatant infection on fibronectin fragment-coated wells, and cocultivation methods provide equivalent rates of transduced cells. The lack of reproducibility and safety indicates that cocultivation is not suitable for clinical studies. In our view, supernatant infection plus centrifugation is easier to perform than using fibronectin fragments, and it is currently the optimal method for clinical studies when large quantities of T lymphocytes are being processed.
