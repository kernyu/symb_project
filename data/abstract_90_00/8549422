The new quinolone antimicrobial agents, particularly those with less activity against anaerobes, selectively prevent colonisation of the alimentary tract by Gram-negative bacilli and staphylococci without substantially affecting the normal anaerobic flora, which preserve the colonisation resistance of the gut. These properties ideally position this class of antibacterial agent for selective decontamination of the digestive tract (SDD) in the prevention of nosocomial infection. The rationale for this procedure is based on the presumption that a significant proportion of infections in compromised patients are endogenous in origin, arising from the host's own microbial flora. If this colonisation by potentially pathogenic microflora within the normal flora can be significantly reduced without being replaced by other more pathogenic microorganisms, the risk of endogenous infection should be minimised. The quinolones have proved to be ideal agents for use in preventing infection in bone marrow transplant and other neutropenic patients. They have been used for SDD in the general intensive care unit population, although the technique has not received widespread acceptance. There have been only 4 reported randomised studies using quinolones as part of SDD regimens and only 301 patients have been evaluated. Although the incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia has been significantly reduced from 36 to 15%, no effect has been shown on mortality. The cost of using SDD is significantly less with the quinolones than with other regimens, and induction of resistance has not been noted. The new quinolones, and in particular the more recently developed agents with extended Gram-positive activity, appear to be ideally suited for SDD, and their careful evaluation in further large, well designed trials is warranted.
