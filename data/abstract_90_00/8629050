P. falciparum was the predominant parasite ( > 80%) species in malaria ridden tea estates of Assam. A simplified 3 day in vivo test to determine chloroquine sensitivity in tea garden tribes revealed that the majority of the cases (85%) were S/RI, 7% were RI, and 3% were RII and 5% were RIII, respectively. Early case detection and treatment were deemed necessary to reduce morbidity and mortality due to P. falciparum in these tea estates.
