An erythromycin-resistant (Emr) Listeria innocua and an Emr Listeria monocytogenes isolate both carried ermC genes, which code for rRNA methylases. The ermC genes were transferable by conjugation to recipient L. monocytogenes, Listeria ivanovii, and Enterococcus faecalis but did not appear to be associated with conjugative plasmids.
