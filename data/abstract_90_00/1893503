Multidrug therapy (MDT) is a major advance in leprosy control and has raised hopes among patients, health workers, and programme managers alike. Where its implementation is vigorous and sustained, the results are extremely gratifying; but problems, both technical and operational, need to be constantly reviewed and solutions found. The opportunities to markedly reduce leprosy in the next decade are immense, but it remains to be seen whether these opportunities are utilized so that leprosy will ultimately be eliminated as a public health problem.
