We have developed a model for designing antimalarial drugs based on interference with an essential metabolism developed by Plasmodium during its intraerythrocytic cycle, phospholipid (PL) metabolism. The most promising drug interference is choline transporter blockage, which provides Plasmodium with a supply of precursor for synthesis of phosphatidylcholine (PC), the major PL of infected erythrocytes. Choline entry is a limiting step in this metabolic pathway and occurs by a facilitated-diffusion system involving an asymmetric carrier operating according to a cyclic model. Choline transport in the erythrocytes is not sodium dependent nor stereospecific as demonstrated using stereoisomers of alpha and beta methylcholine. These last two characteristics along with distinct effects of nitrogen substitution on transport rate demonstrate that choline transport in the infected erythrocyte possesses characteristics quite distinct from that of the nervous system. This indicates a possible discrimination between the antimalarial activity (inhibition of choline transport in the infected erythrocyte) and a possible toxic effect through inhibition of choline entry in synaptosomes. Apart from the de novo pathway of choline, PC can be synthesized by N-methylation from phosphatidylethanolamine (PE). There is a de novo pathway for PE biosynthesis from ethanolamine in infected cells but phosphatidylserine (PS) decarboxylation also occurs. In addition, PE can be directly and abundantly synthesized from serine decarboxylation into ethanolamine, a pathway which is absent from the host. The variety of the pathways that exist for the biosynthesis of one given PL led us to investigate whether an equilibrium can occur between all PL metabolic pathways.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
