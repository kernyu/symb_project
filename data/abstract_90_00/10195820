Alcohol abusers often present with deteriorated glucose metabolism and insulin resistance. Changes in other glucoregulators, such as insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) and IGF-binding protein-1 (IGFBP-1) may also be related to alcohol abuse. We studied the effects of alcohol withdrawal on blood glucose, serum insulin and C-peptide, and plasma IGF-I and IGFBP-1 levels in 27 noncirrhotic male alcoholics aged 43 +/- 9.0 (mean +/- SD) years on four consecutive days immediately after withdrawal. A 4-day monitoring period was conducted in four healthy nonalcoholic control men. The groups were similar in age and body mass index. Glucose, insulin, IGF-I, and IGFBP-1 did not differ significantly between the groups at the baseline, but C-peptide was higher in alcoholics (p < 0.01). After alcohol withdrawal, serum insulin and C-peptide levels increased in close correlation with each other (r = 0.82, p < 0.001). During the 4-day observation period in alcoholics, IGFBP-1 levels declined by 59%, whereas IGF-I increased by 41% (p < 0.001 for both comparisons). The change in insulin correlated inversely with the change in IGFBP-1 levels (r = -0.39, p < 0.05). In the control group, glucose, insulin, IGF-I, and IGFBP-1 remained unchanged during the 4-day monitoring period, whereas some reduction was observed in C-peptide. In conclusion, alcohol withdrawal enhances insulin production, as seen in increased C-peptide levels. An inverse correlation between the changes in insulin and that in IGFBP-1 might suggest that inhibition of IGFBP-1 by insulin remains largely unchanged during the acute phase of alcohol withdrawal.
