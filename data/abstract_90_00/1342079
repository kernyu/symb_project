Candida strains susceptibility from cancer patients were compared with Candida strains susceptibility from patients, without cancer by MIC (minimal inhibitory concentration) and MFC (minimal fungicidal concentration) to Amphotericin B and Nystatin. Broth dilution method and agar dilution method were the procedure employed. The authors find no significant differences between the studied groups. The problem of Candida resistance to polyene antifungals is discussed.
