In vivo administration of either 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) or methamphetamine (MA) produces damage to the dopaminergic nervous system which may be due in part to the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The resistance of superoxide dismutase (SOD) over-expressing transgenic mice to the effects of both MPTP and MA suggests the involvement of superoxide in the resulting neurotoxicity of both compounds. Superoxide can be converted by SOD to hydrogen peroxide, which itself can cause cellular degeneration by reacting with free iron to produce highly reactive hydroxyl radicals resulting in damage to proteins, nucleic acids and membrane phospholipids. Hydrogen peroxide has also been reported to be produced via inhibition of NADH dehydrogenase by MPP + formed during oxidation of MPTP by MAO-B and by dopamine auto-oxidation following MA-induced dopamine release from synaptic vesicles within nerve terminals. To test whether hydrogen peroxide is an important factor in the toxicity of either of these two neurotoxins, we created clonal PC12 lines expressing elevated levels of the hydrogen peroxide-reducing enzyme glutathione peroxidase (GSHPx). Elevation of GSHPx levels in PC12 was found to diminish the rise in ROS levels and lipid peroxidation resulting from MA but not MPTP treatment. Elevated levels of GSHPx also appeared to prevent decreases in transport-mediated dopamine uptake produced via MA administration as well as to attenuate toxin-induced cell loss as measured by either MTT reduction or LDH release. Our data, therefore, suggest that hydrogen peroxide production likely contributes to MA toxicity in dopaminergic neurons.
