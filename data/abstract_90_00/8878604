katG and inhA genes from isoniazid-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains isolated in Finland were examined by PCR or sequencing. By PCR, katG was not detected in 3 of 54 strains. Sequencing of katG from 13 strains showed small point mutations or insertions; a previously described mutation causing a Ser-to-Thr change at position 315 was found in 4 strains, and there were nine new missense mutations of katG. A 209-bp segment of inhA from 17 strains was sequenced, but no mutations were observed. This result indicates that different mutations prevail in different geographical areas.
