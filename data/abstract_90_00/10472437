In order to evaluate the in vivo efficacy of chloroquine in the treatment of P. falciparum malaria, studies have been carried out in Richard-Toll, Fatick and Tambacounda, 3 areas where dynamics of transmission, population movements, as well as prophylactic and curative practises are different. Failure rates in treatment were 13% in site 1 (Richard-Toll) where medical pressure and population movements are high. In sites 2 and 3 (Fatick and Tambacounda), the failure rate was 3%. Even if medical pressure is lower in the latter site (Tambacounda), the higher transmission could be a factor in the spreading of resistance. A surveillance system and better use of chloroquine must be undertaken.
