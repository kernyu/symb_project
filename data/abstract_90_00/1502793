The efficacy of moxidectin was determined against ivermectin-susceptible and resistant strains of Haemonchus contortus. At the onset of the trial, 40 lambs were each infected with 5000 third stage larvae of one of two strains of Haemonchus contortus. The lambs were randomly sorted into eight treatment groups 28 days post-infection and were treated as follows: Group 1, susceptible strain with no treatment; Group 2, resistant strain with no treatment; Group 3, susceptible strain treated with 0.2 mg moxidectin kg-1 body weight; Group 4, resistant strain treated with 0.2 mg moxidectin kg-1; Group 5, resistant strain treated with 0.4 mg moxidectin kg-1; Group 6, susceptible strain treated with 0.2 mg ivermectin kg-1; Group 7, resistant strain treated with 0.4 mg ivermectin kg-1; Group 8, resistant strain treated with 0.8 mg ivermectin kg-1. The lambs were killed 1 week post-treatment. Comparisons were made among groups based on the number of eggs per gram of feces on the day of treatment and the numbers of worms recovered from each lamb. Both moxidectin and ivermectin were effective in removing susceptible Haemonchus with efficacies of 100% and 99.7%, respectively. The efficacy of moxidectin against the resistant strain was 99.9% and 100% at 0.2 mg kg-1 and 0.4 mg kg-1, respectively, whereas there were only 38.8% and 53.1% efficacies in the lambs treated with 0.4 mg ivermectin kg-1 and 0.8 mg kg-1 body weight, respectively.
