Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an important nosocomial pathogen. Resistance to certain beta-lactam antimicrobial agents among P. aeruginosa is increasing. The SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program was designed to employ a network of hospitals in the United States, Canada, Latin America, and Europe to monitor the predominant bacterial and fungal pathogens and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns associated with community-acquired and nosocomial bloodstream, respiratory tract, wound, and urinary tract infections. The purpose of this analysis of SENTRY results was to extract information on the current North American susceptibility pattern of P. aeruginosa for two antipseudomonal cephalosporins, ceftazidime, and cefepime. Clinical isolates were provided by 30 centers in the United States (grouped into five regions) and eight centers in Canada. Susceptibility testing was performed at a central reference laboratory by using broth microdilution methods and interpretive criteria specified by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards. Of the 34, 530 North American bacterial isolates tested during 1997 and 1998, 2299 (6.7%) were P. aeruginosa. There were no substantial differences in regional rates of P. aeruginosa susceptibility to ceftazidime (range 78.8-81.9%) or cefepime (range 80.0-83.4%) The percentage of resistant isolates among the 1784 United States isolates was 13.3% for ceftazidime versus 7.1% for cefepime (p < 0.05). It is essential to continue surveillance of the in vitro efficacy of these and other beta-lactam agents against P. aeruginosa because of the clinical importance of these safe and broad-spectrum cephems used alone or in combination in current clinical practice.
