The emergence of azidothymidine (AZT)-resistant human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) variants in clinical samples was studied by a direct genomic sequencing method. Sequential lymphocyte samples from four patients, who had been treated with AZT for up to 27 months, were shown to gradually accumulate multiple nucleotide changes, some of which are known to be associated with AZT resistance. Several samples were shown to contain mixtures of wild-type and mutated genomes, indicating gradual rather than sudden changes in the HIV-1 quasispecies. These results demonstrate for the first time that automated solid-phase DNA sequencing is a rapid and useful tool for investigation of antiviral drug resistance and suggest that DNA sequencing may be important in routine clinical diagnostics in the future.
