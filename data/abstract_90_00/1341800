High blood pressure of unknown etiology has been related to many pathogenetic factors, mainly dietary salt intake, mental stress, alcohol consumption, sedentary living and aging. Hypertension is more common in condition such as obesity and diabetes mellitus. Sustained elevation of arterial pressure is mediated by vasoconstriction in response to catecholamine release and activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. In obese and diabetic subjects, insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia have been found to be related to development of hypertension. The hypertension phenotype may correspond to many different genotypes codifying various alterations of hormone and receptor function, as well as inherited diseases linked to hypertension. An outstanding epidemiologic example of how hypertension may appear in a community is found in Easter Island. Hypertension among native adults increased from 3 to 30% in a 10 year period, in relation to influx of tourism and changes in salt intake and diet.
