BACKGROUND: Increasing antibiotic resistance has begun to impair our ability to cure Helicobacter pylori infection. AIM: To evaluate orally administered novel therapies for the treatment of H. pylori infection. METHODS: Healthy H. pylori infected volunteers received: (a) hyperimmune bovine colostral immune globulins, (b) an oligosaccharide containing an H. pylori adhesion target, Neu5Aca2-3Galb1-4Glc-(3'-sialyllactose), or (c) recombinant human lactoferrin. Outcome was assessed by urea breath test or histological assessment of the number of H. pylori present. RESULTS: None of the novel therapies appeared effective and no adverse events occurred. CONCLUSION: Although in vitro data appeared promising, in vivo results were disappointing. Higher doses, longer duration of therapy, adjunctive acid suppression, or a combination could possibly yield better results.
