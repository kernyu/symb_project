Resistance patterns of S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae to standard antibiotics in Thailand is not on the rise when compared to previous reports. There is no need at present to change standard antibiotic therapy recommendations for pneumonia by the National ARI. The use of antibiotics for the treatment or prophylactic purposes should be judicious to limit the spread of antimicrobial resistance. This study is the main part of a National surveillance for antimicrobial resistance of S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae. The surveillance programme should be continued to evaluate trends in order to up-date guidelines for the selection of antibiotics of the ARI programme in the future.
