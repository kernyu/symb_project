Thirty-five of 40 clinical isolates of enterococci and streptococci cross-resistant to erythromycin and lincomycin and harbouring erm genes were inducibly resistant to these drugs, suggesting that ribosomal methylation is predominantly inducibly expressed in these bacterial genera. Regulatory regions located upstream of the erm genes of four inducible and three constitutive strains were amplified and sequenced. Expression of constitutive resistance in two strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Enterococcus faecalis could be accounted for by a large deletion or a DNA duplication within the regulatory regions, respectively.
