Malaria chemotherapy has been well reviewed. Malarial parasites gaining resistance is the major problem in the treatment of the disease. Some strains are resistant not only to chloroquine but also to amodiaquine. Few new drugs are available or foreseen for the near future. The principal metabolite of cinchona alkaloids appears to be oxidized at C-2. This may result in a loss of activity. Pinder and Burger suggested that a trifluoromethyl group will prevent this oxidation. So 2-tribromomethyl-6-methoxy-4-(4-hydroxy-3-pyrrolidinomethylanil ino)quinoline (1) was synthesized as a potential biocide (Scheme 1).
