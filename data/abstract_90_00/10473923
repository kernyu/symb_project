A multiple antibiotic-resistant (MAR) strain of Acinetobacter baumannii caused nosocomial cross-infection among 3 patients of a surgical intensive care unit. The isolates were of identical biochemical profile (77776 S-U-) and serotype (serovar 36) and identical in terms of pulsed-field gel electrophoresis macrorestriction (SmaI, ApaI) analysis. This MAR strain was susceptible only to netilmicin, tobramycin, imipenem, meropenem, polymyxin B, and trovafloxacin. The minimal bactericidal concentrations of imipenem and meropenem were markedly higher than the corresponding minimal inhibitory concentrations against this strain. Combined fresh defibrinated human blood (65 vol%) and antimicrobial drug assays yielded the following results: polymyxin was the most rapidly bactericidally effective antibiotic in the presence of blood and in broth. Tobramycin and netilmicin were efficacious in 65 vol% blood. Imipenem was slightly more effective than meropenem in broth, whereas both carbapenems sterilized blood-containing assay tube contents. Trovafloxacin failed to achieve bactericidal activity (to 99.9% kill) in the presence of blood, presumably because this strain was resistant to ciprofloxacin and borderline susceptible to ofloxacin. Trovafloxacin combined with either imipenem or meropenem yielded an indifferent effect. However, the combination of trovafloxacin (2 microg/ml) plus tobramycin (1 microg/ml) achieved sterilization of tube contents in the presence of blood within 4 h after exposure and in broth following extended (overnight) incubation. This MAR strain of A. baumannii was high-level resistant to rifampin; thus the combination of polymyxin B plus rifampin proved indifferent.
