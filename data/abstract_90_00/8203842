The role of Staphylococcus aureus tolerance in the treatment and prophylaxis of endocarditis in rats was investigated. The efficacies of vancomycin, teicoplanin, and daptomycin, alone and in combination with rifampin, were compared in rats with endocarditis infected with a tolerant strain of S. aureus and in rats with endocarditis infected with its nontolerant variant. In vitro the cloxacillin-tolerant strain was also tolerant to vancomycin and teicoplanin, but not to daptomycin. However, tolerance to these antibiotics did not influence the results of treatment of experimental S. aureus endocarditis. There was no difference in the bacterial densities in the vegetations of rats infected with either the tolerant or the nontolerant strain after 5 days of treatment with any of the antibiotic regimens. Of all antibiotics, daptomycin was the most effective in reducing bacterial numbers in vegetations. Combination of rifampin with vancomycin or teicoplanin improved the results of treatment for the tolerant as well as the nontolerant strains. Daptomycin was as effective alone as in combination with rifampin. In contrast, tolerance influenced the prophylactic effects of vancomycin and teicoplanin. The proportion of rats with sterile vegetations after prophylaxis with vancomycin or teicoplanin at a low dose was lower for those infected with the tolerant strain than for those infected with the nontolerant strain. A low dose of daptomycin was equally effective against the tolerant and the nontolerant strains. However, higher doses of all three antibiotics afforded almost full protection against both strains.
