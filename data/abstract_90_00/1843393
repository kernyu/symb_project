Mice infected with 350 cercariae of Schistosoma mansoni (LE strain) were treated with oxamniquine, at the dose of 400 mg/kg, 24, 48, 72, and 96 h after infection. Forty days after the treatment, the animals were submitted to a challenge infection with 80 cercariae, through the abdominal and ear skins. The number of immature worms in the animal groups treated 24 and 96 h after the first infection was found to be lower than that in the control group, thus showing that the death of schistosomes by chemotherapy, at the skin and pulmonary phases, causes an acquired resistance state.
