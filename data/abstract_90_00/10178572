Resistance to antimicrobials results in those antimicrobials becoming ineffective in treating common bacterial infections. To prevent the spread of such resistance the use of antimicrobials requires control. The authors have previously argued that use of regulation or charges to control resistance would not be efficient. Regulation will not account for different marginal costs of reducing antimicrobial prescription amongst GPs, and charges, although based on sound economic concepts, are based on an unrealistic amount of required information. It was therefore argued that a system of tradable permits, by combining the targets of regulation and the market flexibility of charges, would achieve control more efficiently than simple regulation or charges. In this paper the authors progress this proposed policy by considering various important issues which arise when designing such a tradable permit system for antimicrobials. The paper does not provide an exhaustive plan enabling a blueprint for such a market to be designed, but a proposal which may be used as platform for further specific development of such an initiative to deal with resistance.
