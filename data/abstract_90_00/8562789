Synthetic absorbable sutures are available as braided constructions or as monofilaments. Braided absorbable sutures are made either from 90:10 poly(glycolide-co-L(-)-lactide), sold by Ethicon, Inc. under the trade name Vicryl, or from polyglycolide, as sold, for instance, by Davis and Geck under the trade name Dexon. There are, however, some concerns with braided sutures that relate to tissue drag and the trauma this may cause, as well as the possible potentiation of infection through the interstices of the braid structure. Absorbable monofilaments, such as the monofilament sutures derived from p-dioxanone homopolymer (PDS II, an Ethicon, Inc. product), or a copolymer of trimethylene carbonate and glycolide (Maxon, a Davis and Geck product), eliminate many of these concerns, but generally monofilaments do not handle as well as braids. This paper describes the research leading to the introduction of Monocryl (poliglecaprone 25) monofilament sutures, based on segmented block copolymers of epsilon-caprolactone and glycolide. Monocryl sutures will be shown to display excellent handling properties, minimal resistance during passage through tissue and excellent tensile properties. These sutures provide an in vivo breaking strength retention of approximately 20-30% after 2 weeks, considered by many to be the critical wound healing period. Absorption data on these sutures are presented; absorption is complete between the 91st and 119th days of implantation, with slight or minimal tissue reaction.
