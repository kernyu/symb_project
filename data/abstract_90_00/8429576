The in-vivo response of Plasmodium falciparum to a single dose of 25 mg pyrimethamine was evaluated in pregnant women in a semi-rural area of Zaria, northern Nigeria. Forty-four women were enrolled in the study and followed up for 14 days. Thirty-one (70%) of the women had cleared their parasitaemia by Day 7 and they remained parasite negative throughout the 14-day period of observation. The MPCT was 2.48 +/- 0.76 days. Thirteen (30%) of the 44 women were parasite positive either on Day 7 (7.16%) or Day 14 (6.14%) and re-treatment with a curative dose of chloroquine (25 mg kg-1 over 3 days) resulted in complete parasite clearance. Of the eight P. falciparum isolates successfully cultured from these women, seven (87.5%) were highly sensitive and one was resistant in vitro to the SDX/PYR combination.
