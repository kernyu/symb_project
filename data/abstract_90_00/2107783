Branhamella catarrhalis was recovered from one blood culture each from three infants and one neonate admitted to the Trousseau Hospital (Paris) between 1986 and 1988. Clinical features included fever in every case, otitis in three cases, pneumonia in two cases, diarrhea in one case, and enterocolitis in one case. All the strains were beta-lactamase producers. Outcome was favorable in every case. The antimicrobial agent used was erythromycin in one case, amoxicillin in one case, and a third generation cephalosporin in two cases. We reviewed the pediatric literature for reports of Branhamella catarrhalis infections that seem more frequent or better detected than previously. The high prevalence of ampicillin-resistant strains is pointed out.
