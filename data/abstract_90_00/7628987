Furopenem is a novel orally active penem. In this study, furopenem was highly active in vitro against Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC90 0.03 mg/L), Haemophilus influenzae (MIC90, 2 mg/L), and Moraxella catarrhalls (MIC90, 0.5 mg/L). Its activity was not reduced by a variety of beta-lactamase enzymes, however beta -lactam resistance by other mechanisms was associated with higher MICs.
