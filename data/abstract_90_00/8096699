This viewpoint proposes that an imbalance in the TH1-type and TH2-type responses contributes to the immune dysregulation associated with HIV infection, and that resistance to HIV infection and/or progression to AIDS is dependent on a TH1-->TH2 dominance. This hypothesis is based on the authors' findings that: (1) progression to AIDS is characterized by loss of IL-2- and IFN-gamma production concomitant with increases in IL-4 and IL-10; and (2) many seronegative, HIV-exposed individuals generate strong TH1-type responses to HIV antigens.
