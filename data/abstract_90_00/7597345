This report characterizes a multiresistant Vibrio Cholerae O1 strain, isolated from a patient with cholera, and investigates the mechanism of resistance. The analyzed strain was resistant to tetracycline, chloramphenicol and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. The resistance was mediated by a 101 megadalton plasmid that was transferred to the resultant of a conjugation assay between the multiresistant V. Cholerae strain and E. coli C-600 used as receptor strain, that acquired the triple resistance of the parental strain. The resistant V. cholerae strain had a Ogawa serotype, El Tor biotype and toxigenic capacity, demonstrated by ELISA and latex agglutination techniques. The biochemical features of the strain were identical to those of susceptible strains, except for the resistance to 10 and 150 ug o 129 vibriostatic factor. The emergence of plasmid mediated resistance to drugs of choice in the treatment of cholera must alert Chilean and Latin American health authorities, considering the cholera will continue affecting the region.
