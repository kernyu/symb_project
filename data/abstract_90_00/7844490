Five hundred and twenty-six cases of bacterial pneumonia in adults admitted to Chulalongkorn Hospital during the period January 1987 to December 1991 were studied, comparing the elderly aged > or = 60 years (241 cases) with the nonelderly < 60 years of age (285 cases). The study indicates that there was a significantly increased number of community and hospital-acquired pneumonia in the elderly than previously reported. Pneumonia in the elderly might present with no fever, no cough no signs of parenchymal infiltration, but significant mental changes. There was a higher incidence of pleural involvement, but lower incidence of septic shock in the non-elderly than the elderly, which suggests that the nonelderly had better systemic resistance against bacterial infection than the elderly. There was no significant difference in complete blood count between the two groups. However, sputum specimens to be collected through endotracheal tube and Gram-negative bacilli on Gram stain were found more in the elderly than the non-elderly. The elderly had more respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation, septic shock, and had higher mortality than the non-elderly. They also required longer duration of treatment and hospitalization. There were parameters which indicated the high-risk factors for mortality among the elderly. These included hospital-acquired pneumonia, bronchopneumonia, Gram-negative pneumonia, abnormal status of host, sputum specimens requiring collection by suction, respiratory failure and septic shock.
