This paper discusses the results of an experimental study on the effect of biphase calcium phosphate ceramics (BCPC) on laboratory-isolated polyresistant Gram-negative bacteria. Monitoring of this effect in a dynamical regimen was carried out upon Enterobacter cloacae 313, Klebsiella pneumoniae 227, Serratia marcescens 206, Klebsiella oxytoca 202, as well as on the standard strain Klebsiella pneumoniae 52145 (Institute Pasteur, Paris). The results show a significant antimicrobial effect of the ceramics. Antimicrobial properties are manifested during direct contact with BCPC and these depend on the quantity and grain size of the particles, as well as on the microbiological characteristics of the test microorganisms, and particularly on their cell size.
