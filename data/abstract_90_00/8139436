During November and December 1992, the authors surveyed the malaria morbidity and the drugs efficiency in an urban area of Dakar region. Malaria represented 13.68% of the fevers in Dakar district and 12.4% in Pikine. The mean parasitic density was evaluated at 5000/mm3. Good efficiency of antimalarial drugs were noted but chloroquine-resistance is present with 24% of prevalence.
