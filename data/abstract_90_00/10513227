A 7-day in vivo test system was applied to assess the parasitological response to chloroquine treatment in patients with falciparum malaria in the Central Province and National Capital District of Papua New Guinea. 30 patients were investigated but only 23 took a full course of chloroquine and were completely followed up. Of the 23 patients, 13 (57%) were negative for malaria parasites on day 2, 4 (17%) had significantly reduced parasitaemia by day 2 and cleared parasites by day 7, and 1 (4%) showed a partial response (R2). In 5 (22%) of the patients resistance at the R3 level was observed. The indication from this study is that chloroquine should continue to be the first-line drug for the treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria. However, judicious use of chloroquine in uncomplicated falciparum malaria is required to halt the spread of chloroquine-resistant strains of Plasmodium falciparum.
