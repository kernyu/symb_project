Selected characteristics of arm and leg muscle contraction were examined in a racially mixed group of male detoxified alcoholics (N = 45, ages 20-49) and age-matched controls (N = 75). Lifetime drinking histories estimated the mean lifetime consumption of ethanol to be 8.96, 12.1 and 20.4 kg ethanol/kg body weight for alcoholic subjects aged 20-29, 30-39 and 40-49, respectively. The severity of the alcohol dependence syndrome (ADS scale) was marked in alcoholics, but was not age-dependent. Alcoholics did not differ significantly from controls on health status or physical activity scales. The performance of alcoholic subjects was impaired on all muscle function measures, with relatively more impairment found in older alcoholics. Maximal knee extension force generated at 3 muscle lengths (hip, angle, 45 degrees, 90 degrees, 180 degrees) was impaired only in alcoholics 30-49 years of age. Forearm (handgrip) muscle strength was impaired in all age groups of alcoholics. Maximal muscle (biceps) contraction speed at 3 levels of resistance was impaired only in alcoholics in their fifth decade of life. The greatest deficit in alcoholics (all age groups) was observed in the anaerobic power (bicycle ergometer) test. Thus, the magnitude of dysfunction and the extent of age-relatedness was found to be a function of the muscle test employed.
