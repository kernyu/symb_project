During human schistosomiasis host responses to antigens of various parasite life-cycle stages may contribute to whether the severe, hepatosplenic state develops or the patient remains relatively asymptomatic throughout infection, and may play a role in resistance. This study evaluated production of interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) in vitro by schistosome antigen-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from asymptomatic patients, and by PBMCs from apparently uninfected, untreated persons living in areas endemic for Schistosoma mansoni ('endemic normals'). IFN-gamma production parallels PBMC proliferation in that schistosomal egg antigens stimulate patent patients' cells poorly, but strongly stimulate PBMCs from 'endemic normals'. This is proportionally true for antigens from adult worms and cercariae. Although asymptomatic patent patients' cells produced little or no IFN-gamma in response to the 3 schistosomal antigenic extracts, their PBMCs, and PBMCs from 'endemic normals', produced expected amounts of IFN-gamma when exposed to phytohaemagglutinin. This implies that persons with patent infections have schistosome antigen-specific defects in their ability to respond to IFN-gamma production that are not exhibited by putatively resistant 'endemic normals'.
