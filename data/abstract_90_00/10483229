The etiological spectrum and some immunoaggressive properties of microorganisms, that cause pyoderma in newborns which were isolated from patients have been studied. It was established that staphylococci (mostly coagulase-positive S. aureus, S. hyicus, S. intermedius) played the leading role in etiology of pyoderma, mostly in association with coagulase-negative staphylococci and (or) other conditionally pathogenic bacteria. Staphylococci occupying significant place in the skin diseases etiology are multiresistant to antibiotics and have valuable anti-lysozyme and anticomplement activities.
