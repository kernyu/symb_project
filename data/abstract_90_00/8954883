Lactobacillus reuteri G4 contains a 7.0-kb plasmid (pTC82) encoding resistance to chloramphenicol (Cm). Determination of the nucleotide sequence of the genetic determinant (cat-TC) encoding resistance to Cm on pTC82 revealed an open reading frame for a 238-amino-acid Cm acetyltransferase (CAT) monomer. This structural cat gene, 714 bp in length, was highly related (ca. 95% nucleotide and ca. 81% amino acid identity) to the 648-bp cat gene from Staphylococcus aureus plasmid pC194. A total of 6 bp transversions and 4 bp deletions was observed along the whole DNA sequence of cat-TC compared to that of cat-pC194. To determine the activity of the putative cat-TC gene, recombinant plasmid pUC8217 containing the cat determinant from pTC82 was subjected to a maxicell analysis. The observed molecular mass of the synthesized protein, based on electrophoretic mobility, was in reasonable agreement with the 27.3 kDa predicted from the DNA sequence. This is the first reported nucleotide sequence of a Cm-resistance determinant from L. reuteri and also the first evidence of adding Lactobacillus to the list of versatile bacterial genera which naturally acquire the cat-pC194 gene in the microbial ecological system.
