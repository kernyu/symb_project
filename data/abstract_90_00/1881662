Systemic fungal infections can be primary or opportunistic. The mycoses caused by opportunistic pathogens become increasingly more important. These infections are mainly caused by Candida species, Aspergillus species, Cryptococcus neoformans, Mucor etc. The predisposing factors to these diseases are numerous: neutropenia, organ transplantation, use of steroids, broad spectrum antibiotics, antineoplastic chemotherapy, parenteral nutrition, prolonged intravenous infusions, extensive surgery etc. Mortality is high because many fungal infection are difficult to diagnose, especially in their early, more treatable stages. Considerable progress in treating these infections has been achieved. Systemic fungal infections, however, continue to present major problems, including clinical resistance, microbial resistance, emergence of new pathogens and involvement of more susceptible patients. The purpose of this paper is to review the recent progress and current problems in diagnosis, treatment and prevention of opportunistic systemic fungal infections.
