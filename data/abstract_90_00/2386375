The in vitro activity of cefixime was comparatively tested against 232 non-type b and 102 type b isolates of Haemophilus influenzae derived from clinical specimens of pediatric patients, including 10 non-type b strains that did not produce beta-lactamase and demonstrated resistance to ampicillin. Cefixime was active against the ampicillin-susceptible and ampicillin-resistant, beta-lactamase-producing isolates; however, its activity against some non-beta-lactamase-producing, ampicillin-resistant isolates appeared to be limited.
