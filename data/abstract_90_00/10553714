Progress in the development of fluoroquinolones for the treatment of sexually transmitted diseases has been slow. New compounds have appeared with good in vitro activity against the gonococcus, Chlamydia trachomatis and the genital mycoplasmas. However, there have been increasing reports of clinically relevant resistance by the gonococcus, and chlamydial and mycoplasmal resistance in vitro has been described. Formally reported treatment studies have not been forthcoming, despite an emerging role for the newer fluoroquinolones in the ambulatory treatment of pelvic inflammatory disease.
