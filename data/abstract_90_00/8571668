In Belgium benzimidazole resistance has been reported in 28% of the sheep farms and 29 to 50% of the studs. In several member states of the European Union the prevalence of anthelmintic resistance (AR) is even higher than in Belgium, although AR is nearly absent in some countries of Southern Europe. AR is particularly widespread in certain nematodes of sheep, goats and horses in Europe, whereas only sporadic cases of AR have been reported in helminths of cattle. In Belgium only one case of AR has been described in goat and one in cattle; no surveys for AR have been carried out in pigs. The main helminth species, in which AR has been observed, are Haemonchus contortus, Ostertagia circumcincta and Trichostrongylus spp. in small ruminants, the Cyathostominae in horses and Oesophagostomum spp. in pigs. Resistance has developed particularly against the benzimidazoles and to a lesser extent against the levamisole/morantel group. Up to now the prevalence of ivermectin resistance remains low, but the number of cases is increasing during recent years. Due to the low sensitivity of the currently used techniques for the detection of AR (egg count reduction test and in vitro egg hatch test) the available figures underestimate the prevalence of AR. Finally, possible control measures are discussed in order to avoid or to delay the development of resistance.
