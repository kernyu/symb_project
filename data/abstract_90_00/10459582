The regions encoding the 5.8S rRNA and the flanking internal transcribed spacers (ITSI and ITSII) from two isolates of the human pathogenic fungus Scedosporium prolificans and one isolate of the taxonomically related species Pseudallescheria boydii (S. apiospermum) were sequenced. The sequences of the two S. prolificans isolates were identical. However, there were minor differences between both species. Phylogenetic analysis of known fungal sequences confirmed a close relationship between S. prolificans and P. boydii. An attempt was made to transform S. prolificans by electroporation using a plasmid vector, pMLF2, bearing the Escherichia coli hygromycin B phosphotransferase gene (hph) under the control of Aspergillus nidulans promoter and terminator sequences. To increase transformation efficiency, the sequenced ribosomal cluster of S. prolificans was used to construct a new vector for homologous recombination.
