A previous study had suggested that local strains of goat trichostrongyles, comprising largely Haemonchus contortus, might have developed resistance to benzimidazole anthelmintics. A trial involving 18 goats was conducted to confirm this. There was a significant (P < 0.01) reduction in worm burdens in goats given levamisole, but this was not so for those animals given albendazole, fenbendazole, oxfendazole and mebendazole (P > 0.05).
