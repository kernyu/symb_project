The 98th General Meeting of the American Society for Microbiology was held from May 17-21, 1998, in Atlanta, Georgia and was attended by well over 10,000 scientists. The theme of antibiotic resistance dominated the meeting with numerous presentations on resistance mechanisms, new targets and potential antimicrobial agents. Many new insights into the understanding of microbial physiology were provided. Microbial genomics was shown to be revolutionizing the way in which scientists can probe and explore bacteria and fungi.
