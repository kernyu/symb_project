This article reviews the eight factors that determine the outcome of selective antimicrobial control (SAC) a technique aimed at the clearance of intestinal Gram-negative bacillary carriage by means of lethal faecal anti-microbial concentrations. They are as follows: (i) the carrier state; (ii) compliance; (iii) SAC aiming at prophylaxis vs treatment; (iv) minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of the antimicrobial; (v) dosage; (vi) pharmacokinetics; (vii) faecal inactivation; and (viii) microorganisms to be controlled. In the second part, non-absorbable SAC regimens are compared with absorbable trimethoprim/sulphamethoxazole (TMP/SMZ) and the fluoroquinolones in different clinical settings including neutropenia, intensive care, hepatic encephalopathy, liver transplantation and the salmonella carrier state. Ablation of gut carriage and superinfections are the main endpoints reviewed in this article. The newer fluoroquinolones are potent SAC agents to deal with enterobacteria. Pseudomonads are the major gap in their SAC spectrum. TMP/SMZ emerges as a SAC agent of limited value, whilst the newer non-absorbable combination of polymyxin/tobramycin seems to be the most potent SAC programme since it has activity against pseudomonads. In a third part, three current issues--the emergence of resistance, the selectivity and the tissue effect are discussed. Finally, a potent fluoroquinolone combined with oral polymyxin/tobramycin seems to be the most effective SAC programme currently available to control enterobacteria and pseudomonads in patients in whom bacterial translocation is a risk with minimal risk of resistance emerging.
