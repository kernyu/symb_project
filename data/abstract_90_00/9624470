A prospective study was performed with 23 Helicobacter pylori-infected children (mean age, 9.5 +/- 4.4 years) with clinical symptoms of gastritis and positive results of culture and histologic examination of gastric biopsy specimens to evaluate the influence of antibiotic resistance on eradication. Positive children were treated for 4 weeks with lansoprazole and for 2 weeks with either amoxicillin-metronidazole or spiramycin (a macrolide)-metronidazole. At endoscopy 1 month after the discontinuation of therapy, the eradication rate and improvement of histologically related gastritis were significantly dependent on the susceptibility or the resistance of the infecting organism to metronidazole (83 versus 17% and 88 versus 16.6%, respectively). Pretreatment determination of the susceptibility is appropriate in any anti-H, pylori regimen, including one with metronidazole.
