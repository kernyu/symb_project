The effectiveness of clean grazing systems for controlling the sheep abomasal parasite Haemonchus contortus under experimental conditions was monitored for a grazing season in ewes and lambs carrying either benzimidazole-susceptible or resistant populations of the parasite. Both preventive and evasive strategies failed to give effective control of H contortus. Lambs grazing with ewes that had received no anthelmintic showed clinical signs of haemonchosis by early July. Lambs from ewes dosed with a benzimidazole (mebendazole) before turn out, developed clinical signs of haemonchosis later in the season. The presence of anthelmintic resistant genotypes had a significant effect on the appearance of clinical signs, and on the epidemiology and control of disease. It was concluded that alternative worm control strategies will be required for the effective control of H contortus in the United Kingdom.
