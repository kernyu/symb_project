The efficacy of FK463, a new (1,3)-beta-D-glucan synthase inhibitor, against azole-resistant Candida albicans strains has been studied. The MIC of FK463 was lower than those of azoles and amphotericin B against CDR1-expressing C26 and CaMDR-expressing C40 strains. All mice treated with FK463 (1 mg/kg) survived disseminated murine candidiasis. The fungal burden in the kidney after 6 days was markedly reduced after therapy with FK463 and amphotericin B sodium deoxycholate, and plasma (1,3)-beta-D-glucan concentration was found to be lower in FK463-treated mice. In our study, FK463 was found to be a potent antifungal agent against disseminated infection with azole-resistant C. albicans.
