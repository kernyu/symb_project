Cefdinir, a so-called third-generation oral cephalosporin was tested in vitro against over 700 pathogens from patients with bacteremia. Cefdinir was very active against the Enterobacteriaceae with a 50% minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC50) value range of less than or equal to 0.03-8 micrograms/ml. The enteric species having the highest MIC90S (greater than or equal to 16 micrograms/ml) were Citrobacter freundii, and the enterobacters, Morganella morganii, Proteus vulgaris, and Serratia marcescens. Cefdinir was generally two- to fourfold less active than cefixime, but markedly more potent with a wider spectrum compared with older oral cephalosporins, cefaclor or cefuroxime. In contrast to cefixime, cefdinir inhibited Staphylococcus aureus (MIC90, 1 micrograms/ml) and other staphylococci. Pneumococci, beta-hemolytic streptococci, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and pathogenic Neisseria spp. (MIC90S, 0.12-0.5 micrograms/ml) were cefdinir susceptible, but Pseudomonas aeruginosa, oxacillin-resistant staphylococci and Bacteroides fragilis gr. strains were resistant. Cefdinir was generally bactericidal with a minimal inoculum effect at 10(6) colony-forming units per spot. Cefdinir beta-lactamase hydrolysis by some recently described extended broad spectrum beta-lactamases was suspected. Cefdinir exhibited a wide, balanced spectrum for an oral cephalosporin indicating possible clinical use against susceptible pathogens in respiratory tract, urinary tract, genital and cutaneous infections.
