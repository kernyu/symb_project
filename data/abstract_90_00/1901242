We have shown that cis diamminedichloroplatinum-(II) (DDP) resistant mutants can be isolated from the human ovarian carcinoma cell line A2780 using a single-step selection protocol with DDP. DDP resistant colonies were calculated to be present at a frequency of 1.7 x 10(-6)/viable cell using a fluctuation analysis. The mutational origin of these surviving colonies is inferred by the fact that their frequency is increased by treatment of the A2780 cells with the chemical mutagen ethyl methane-sulfonate, with a maximum frequency observed after a 3-day expression time. Independently isolated clones maintain, in the absence of selection, a DDP resistant phenotype up to 7-fold more resistant than the parental A2780 cells. The resistance modifiers aphidicolin and buthionine sulfoximine have no effect on the frequency of DDP resistant mutants. Therefore neither of these drugs appears to have an effect on increasing the sensitivity of DDP resistant mutants existing in a cell population prior to DDP exposure.
