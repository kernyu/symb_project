A group of volunteers was exposed to coaction of carbon dioxide (concentration 300 mg/cu m) and heating microclimate (ambient temperature +50 +/- 2 degrees C, relative humidity 20 +/- 5%), simultaneously they received one of the medicines: placebo, bemitil (0.5 g), bromantane (0.25 g) or bemitil (0.5 g) combined with bromantane (0.25 g). Bromantane (0.25 g) or bemitil (0.5 g) combined with bromantane (0.25 g) were proved to be the most effective method to increase stability of the human body against co-action of carbon dioxide and heating microclimate.
