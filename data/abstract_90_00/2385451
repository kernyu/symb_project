From June 1988 to October 1989, 190 women from the department of Obstetrics-Gynecology with bacteriuria due to Gram-negative rods were studied. One hundred and three were investigated as ambulatory patients. Fifty three had received treatment with a beta-lactam antibiotic during the past three months and 11 between three and six-months before sampling. The organisms causing bacteriuria were 163 E. coli, 12 P. mirabilis and 15 were due to other species. Thirty three E. coli and the 15 other species were resistant to amoxicillin and/or to cefalotin. When comparing previous treatment and resistance to amino-penicillins it appears that: of the women who had received a beta-lactam antibiotic within the three months before testing, 57% of the strains recovered were found resistant for amino-penicillins; of the women without treatment during the past six months, 89% of the strains recovered were sensitive and six per cent of E. coli plus five per cent of another Gram negative rod were resistant to amino-penicillins.
