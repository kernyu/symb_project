The activities of antimicrobial combinations from three geographically diverse skin/tissue banks used in the processing of skin/ tissue were compared using bacteria and yeast isolated from burn patients. All formulations showed 90% or more effectiveness against bacteria generally susceptible to antibiotics but were less effective (60-80%) when tested against bacteria resistant to specific antimicrobials. Anti-yeast activity was present when an appropriate antifungal agent was included in the combination. All formulations were stable for at least six weeks. Results of this study raise certain questions about the use of these antimicrobial combinations in contemporary skin/tissue banking and point the way toward areas for future study.
