Sultamicillin, a new semisynthetic oral beta-lactam antibiotic, was evaluated for its antibacteria susceptibility and clinical efficacy against urinary tract infection (UTI), and the following results were obtained. The sensitivity of sultamicillin (SBTPC) on 518 strains of clinical isolates from the urine were tested and compared to ampicillin (ABPC). S. aureus, S. epidermidis, Enterococcus sp., Streptococcus sp., E. coli, K. pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, P. mirabilis, M. morganii and Acinetobacter sp. showed high sensitivity to SBTPC. The antibacterial activity of SBTPC was superior to that of ABPC in most strains and especially more superior in beta-lactamase producing strains. The clinical effectiveness rate on a total of 15 patients with acute uncomplicated cystitis was 93.3% and the eradication rate of causative organisms was 93.3%. On 15 patients with chronic complicated UTI, the clinical effectiveness rate was 73.3% and eradication rate was 76.5%. Side effects (diarrhea) were observed in 3 cases, but this symptom was not severe and soon disappeared. Abnormal laboratory data due to the drug were not observed.
