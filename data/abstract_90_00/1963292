An 863-base-pair DNA fragment containing the fosfomycin resistance gene from transposon Tn2921 was sequenced. Analysis of the sequence revealed the presence of a single open reading frame that encoded the FOS polypeptide of 16 kilodaltons from Tn2921. Minicell fractionation studies showed that the FOS protein was located in the bacterial cytoplasm.
