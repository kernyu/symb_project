Chronic hepatitis B infection is a serious health threat in the Asia-Pacific area. A consensus meeting on the treatment of chronic hepatitis B infection was conducted in Hong Kong, in August 1997. It was generally agreed that treatment of chronic hepatitis B infection should be based on the understanding of the natural history of chronic hepatitis B infection. To date, interferon alpha is the only Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved form of therapy for chronic hepatitis B infection. The overall response in Asian patients is unsatisfactory: approximately 15-20% will clear hepatitis B e antigen, but less than 5% will clear hepatitis B surface antigen. Newer immunomodulatory therapies are under trial. In contrast, nucleoside analogues, such as lamivudine (pending FDA approval) and famciclovir, have been shown to be potent suppressors of hepatitis B viral replication; however, their role as monotherapy in the treatment of chronic hepatitis B infection remains to be defined. Also, the issues of resistance to nucleoside analogues and withdrawal rebound need to be carefully studied. The future direction of therapy in chronic hepatitis B infection is probably a combination of nucleoside analogues or nucleoside analogues with immunomodulatory therapy.
