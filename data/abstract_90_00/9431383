We analyzed an outbreak of Escherichia coli bacteremia in eight patients with leukemia in a hematology-oncology unit from July to September 1994. The antibiograms and genotypic patterns of the isolates were different, thus suggesting that the outbreak did not originate from a single clone. However, all the isolates were resistant to quinolones, which led us to examine the microbiological records from 1992 to 1994. The incidence of quinolone-resistant E. coli bacteremia in the hematology-oncology unit ranged from 81.8% to 94.6% during this period. We then analyzed 36 more isolates recovered from late 1994 to 1995. Field inversion gel electrophoresis patterns of these isolates were also different. Analysis of the quinolone resistance determining region in gyrA revealed that all the isolates had a double mutation in gyrA. In conclusion, quinolone-resistant E. coli could be an emerging threat to neutropenic patients with leukemia who receive a quinolone prophylactically, and attention must be paid to this trend of resistance.
