OBJECTIVE: To determine the proportion of children with acute otitis media (AOM) presenting in our catchment area in New York City who were infected with nonsusceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae and to determine the susceptibility of these organisms to penicillins and other antibiotics commonly used to treat AOM. SETTING: Ambulatory clinics and the emergency department of a tertiary care, inner-city medical center. PATIENTS: During a 2-year period from 1993 to 1995, 115 children (aged 6 months to 12 years) with AOM underwent tympanocentesis. Patients did not receive antibiotics for at least 1 week before tympanocentesis. RESULTS: Thirty-one children were infected with S pneumoniae, and 83.9% of isolates were susceptible to penicillin. Of the 16.1% strains that were nonsusceptible, most (4 of 5 strains) were intermediately resistant, and only 1 exhibited high-level resistance to penicillin. Of all the cephalosporins tested, only cefotaxime had consistent activity against the intermediately resistant strains. Notably, all nonsusceptible pneumococci were inhibited by macrolides. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides unique reference data for nonsusceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae in children with AOM and documents that newer cephalosporin agents are not active against all of these strains.
