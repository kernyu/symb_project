At the Danish Veterinary Laboratory Streptococcus suis infections in pigs were diagnosed in 114 cases in 1995 and in 151 cases in 1996. Isolates were serotyped using specific antisera against type 1 through 28 and a total of 67 cases from 1995 and 113 cases in 1996 were tested for resistance to 11 antimicrobial agents. The majority of cases were lung diseases (57%), followed by septicaemia (16%), meningitis (15%) and endocarditis (8%). Almost 96% of the isolates could be typed using the 28 antisera. The most common serotype was serotype 2 (29%), followed by serotype 7 (17%), and serotypes 3, 4 and 8 (9-10%). The remaining serotypes were observed in frequencies of less than 5%. Serotype 7 was more commonly isolated from septicaemia than the other serotypes. Serotype 2 was more commonly isolated from pigs older than 4 weeks compared to the other serotypes. Most isolates were susceptible to amoxycillin + clavulanate, ampicillin, ceftiofur, enrofloxacin, penicillin, spectinomycin, tiamulin and trimethoprim + sulphadiazine. A high frequency (> 30%) of resistance to tetracycline was observed. Among isolates of serotype 2, 9.7% were resistant to lincomycin and 12.9% to spiramycin. Among other serotypes 56.8% were resistant to lincomycin and spiramycin. The differences in susceptibility between isolates of serotype 2 and the other serotypes were statistically significant. Compared to a previous Danish study the distribution of serotypes of S. suis causing infections among pigs in Denmark has changed during the last 15 years.
