The macrolides remain excellent antibiotics for many infections particularly those involving intracellular and/or respiratory pathogens. Erythromycin is still an effective drug for many acute orofacial infections. The newer macrolides, azithromycin and clarithromycin, should also prove efficacious although there is very little current data on their use in orofacial infections. They have the advantages over erythromycin of less GI toxicity, higher tissue concentrations, greater gram-negative spectrum, and once or twice daily dosing for better patient compliance. Macrolide concentration in inflammatory cells and transport to the site of infection is a distinct advantage over other antibiotics. Both erythromycin and clarithromycin are associated with significant drug interactions but azithromycin is devoid of such potential toxicity. Azithromycin is less effective against gram-negative cocci than erythromycin and clarithromycin and attains very high tissue concentrations for a very long time, but whether either of these characteristics is clinically significant for orofacial infections is presently unknown.
