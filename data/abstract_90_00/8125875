We studied the effects of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) on pressor response, microvascular filtration coefficient (Kf), extravascular lung water, and plasma concentrations of cyclooxygenase- and 5-lipoxygenase-derived products in 21 blood-perfused dog lungs with constant flow. The lungs were perfused for 1 h with an intrapulmonary injection of saline as vehicle (n = 5), a low dose of ASA [136 +/- 25 (SD) micrograms/ml perfusate; n = 5], a high dose of ASA (1,006 +/- 278 micrograms/ml perfusate; n = 6), or alloxan (1,000 mg; n = 5). Alloxan significantly increased Kf and extravascular lung water, whereas neither the low nor high dose of ASA increased Kf or extravascular lung water. The ASA-induced increase in vascular resistance did not correlate with the extent of the decrease in perfusate 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha or the ratio of perfusate 6-ketoprostaglandin F1 alpha to thromboxane B2. Moreover, ASA did not enhance the generation of perfusate leukotrienes B4, D4, or E4. We conclude that pulmonary microvascular permeability is unaltered by ASA and that neither the decrease in plasma prostacyclin nor the increase in plasma sulfidopeptide leukotrienes may account for ASA-induced pulmonary vasoconstriction.
