Rats of two strains (BN/BiRij and WAG/Rij) were fed the ethanol-containing Lieber-De Carli liquid diet supplemented with high amounts of vitamin A for 16 months. In contrast to Lieber and co-workers, who showed liver fibrosis developing within 9 months on the same diet in Sprague-Dawley rats, we were unable to demonstrate a histological and biochemical increase in liver collagen in either strain. Steatosis was present to a varying degree in both strains in ethanol-treated rats, but also in control animals. Considerable liver inflammation with focal necrosis accompanied by severe systemic inflammation was observed in 60% of the ethanol-treated WAG rats. This suggests that, at least in rats, the main effects of chronic ethanol consumption on the liver may be secondary to interference with host resistance to infections. The ethanol-high vitamin A Lieber-De Carli liquid diet does not necessarily elicit fibrosis or other characteristic histological abnormalities of human alcoholic liver disease.
