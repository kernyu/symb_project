A knowledge of the bacterial ecology of a haematology unit should help in the management of the febrile patient with or without neutropenia. We studied the prevalence and the susceptibility profiles of bacteria isolated during a six-year period among patients hospitalized in a 44-bed haematology unit. Antibiotic use over this period was also studied. The most prevalent bacteria were coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) (35.1%), Escherichia coli (11.4%), Staphylococcus aureus (9.9%), Enterococcus spp. (8.2%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (7.5%). The susceptibility of CNS to oxacillin decreased from 67-44% over six years, while that of enterobacteriaceae to amoxycillin and piperacillin was reduced by about 50%. P. aeruginosa susceptibility to ceftazidime remained remarkably stable at around 90%, despite extensive empirical use. Imipenem and ciprofloxacin were used restrictively and ceftazidime-resistant P. aeruginosa remained susceptible to these two agents in most cases. Our antibiotic policy was found to be compatible with the frequency of the bacterial strains isolated in our department and with their susceptibility profiles.
