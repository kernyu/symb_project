The development of antibiotic resistance in anaerobic bacteria has a tremendous impact on the selection of antimicrobial agents for empirical therapy. Susceptibility studies have documented the emergence of antimicrobial resistance and indicate distinct differences in resistance patterns related to individual hospitals, geographic regions, and antibiotic-prescribing regimens. Resistance to beta-lactam drugs, clindamycin, tetracyclines, and 5-nitroimidazoles (metronidazole) has been observed. The prime mechanism for resistance to beta-lactam agents is the production of beta-lactamases. Resistance to clindamycin is mediated by modification of the ribosome. Tetracycline resistance is mediated by both tetracycline efflux and ribosomal protection. 5-Nitroimidazole resistance appears to be caused by a combination of decreased antibiotic uptake and decreased nitroreductase activity. The level of chloramphenicol susceptibility remains quite high, whereas uniform resistance to aminoglycosides and quinolones is observed. Understanding the mechanisms of resistance is critical for both informed selection of antimicrobial therapy and the design of new antimicrobial agents.
