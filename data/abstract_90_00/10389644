Imipenem-induced beta-lactamase (level of expression, specific activity and kinetic parameters (Vmax and Km) in response to nitrocefin) and outer membrane proteins (OMPs) (hydrophobicity, permeability and electrophoretic pattern) were characterized in, one beta-lactam sensitive (PAC-9), one resistant (PAC-1) and two resistant laboratory mutants (PAC-9M, PAC-9M2) of Comamonas acidovorans strains. Beta-lactamases from both mutant strains showed different Vmax values compared to the parental strains. Beta-lactam resistance was found to be associated in PAC-1 with inducible beta-lactamase production and OMP alteration by the appearance of a 102-KDa protein. Moreover, PAC-1 was less permeable to nitrocefin than PAC-9. These data indicate that C. acidovorans resistance to beta-lactam resulted from synergy between beta-lactamase and OMP alterations.
