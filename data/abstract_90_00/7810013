A case of septicaemia in a seven-day-old infant with a gentamicin-resistant strain of Enterobacter cloacae prompted an epidemiological survey in a neonatal unit. Another 18 patients harboured gentamicin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae without symptoms. Control of the outbreak was achieved by cohort nursing, strict hygiene and reduction of aminoglycoside consumption by 50%. Efficiency of the measures was monitored by weekly faecal samples from all patients. All strains produced the aminoglycoside modifying enzyme AAC(3)II. The resistance was plasmid-mediated.
