The comparative in vitro potency and post-antibiotic effect (PAE) of gemifloxacin (SB-265805), moxifloxacin, trovafloxacin, grepafloxacin, levofloxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin and rifampicin were evaluated against Legionella pneumophila serogroups 1-9 and 12 (n = 204) and other Legionella spp. (n = 34). MICs were determined by standard two-fold agar dilution. PAE was determined by exposing the isolates to the test agents at 4 x MIC for 1 h. Trovafloxacin was the most potent agent overall (MIC range < or =0.004-0.016 mg/L, MIC(90) < or =0.008 mg/L). Of the other quinolones tested, gemifloxacin, moxifloxacin, grepafloxacin and levofloxacin were more potent (MIC(90) 0.016 mg/L) against L. pneumophila than ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin (MIC(90) 0. 03 mg/L). Against Legionella spp., the test quinolones were more potent (MIC range < or =0.004-0.06 mg/L) than either erythromycin or azithromycin (MIC(90) 0.5 and 0.25 mg/L, respectively). Gemifloxacin had the longest PAE (4.65 h) of the agents tested against erythromycin-resistant L. pneumophila. Of the quinolones, only gemifloxacin, grepafloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin had PAEs of >3 h against erythromycin-resistant Legionella spp. Azithromycin, erythromycin and clarithromycin had PAEs of <3 h against all erythromycin-resistant strains. Against erythromycin-susceptible L. pneumophila, only gemifloxacin, moxifloxacin, ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin had PAEs of >3 h, and only rifampicin, ofloxacin, gemifloxacin and erythromycin had PAEs of >2 h against erythromycin-susceptible Legionella spp. The superior potency of gemifloxacin compared with erythromycin indicates that it may be of use in the treatment of legionellosis. The significant PAE described here, combined with favourable pharmacokinetics, supports once-daily dosing for gemifloxacin in the treatment of legionella infections.
