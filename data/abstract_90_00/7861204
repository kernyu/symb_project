Through the introduction of a 7-mercapto-1,3-thiazole chain at position 3' of the dihydrothiazine ring, cefodizime, which is structurally similar to cefotaxime, has acquired a number of remarkable immunomodulatory properties while retaining a potent antimicrobial spectrum of activity. Cefodizime penetrates in fact readily through the bacterial cell wall and interacts with its molecular targets in such a way that at high concentrations cell death and lysis are rapidly induced. Its spectrum of action encompasses the Enterobacteria, Neisseriae, Haemophilus, Moraxella catarrhalis, methicillin-susceptible staphylococci and streptococci, with pneumococci included. Cefodizime is devoid of useful potency against Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter and enterococci. Given the wide occurrence of strains synthesizing beta-lactamases in several primary pathogens of community-acquired and nosocomial infections, the complete stability of cefodizime towards the most prevalent of these hydrolytic enzymes (TEM-1, TEM-2, SHV-1, BRO-1 and the staphylococcal penicillinases) seems reassuring. Only a few chromosomally-coded and extended spectrum beta-lactamases produced by gram-negative microorganisms inactivate the new cephalosporin. Since the distribution of pathogens carrying these enzymes depends on the local trends of antibacterial consumption and cannot be easily predicted, a large multicenter study in Italy has recently assessed the antibacterial potency of cefodizime, in comparison with suitable drugs, on 1985 selected nosocomial strains. In this survey cefodizime was more effective in vitro than amoxicillin-clavulanate, gentamicin and piperacillin while being substantially similar in the rates of eradication of gram-negative and gram-positive organisms to other third generation cephalosporins like ceftazidime and ceftriaxone.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
