Strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were isolated from patients treated in the Centre of Thermal Affections in 1985-1989. It was shown that 72.9, 59.3, 33.8 and 54.2 per cent of the isolates were sensitive to cefotaxime, tobramycin, gentamicin and polymyxin, respectively. The study of pathogenicity factors of the isolates revealed that 83 per cent of the strains produced thermolabile enterotoxin, 79.6 per cent of the strains had adhesive activity and 71.1 per cent of the strains produced hemolysin. The study detected combinations of various pathogenicity factors. 42.3 per cent of the isolates had both adhesive and enterotoxigenic properties. Adhesiveness and hemolytic activity were shown by 13.5 per cent of the strains. 16.9 per cent of the strains produced both enterotoxin and hemolysin. Adhesive activity, enterotoxigenicity and hemolysin production were observed in 6.7 per cent of the strains. It was noted that the strains of P. aeruginosa resistant to polymyxin mainly produced enterotoxin (18.6 per cent) and those resistant to cefotaxime had adhesive activity (34.0 per cent).
