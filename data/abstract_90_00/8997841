The antimalarial activity of boiled water extracts of two medicinal plants (Cymbopogon giganteus and Enantia chlorantha) against chloroquine resistant Plasmodium yoelii nigeriensis in albino mice was assessed. Twenty-five mice were used for each extract. Each mouse was inoculated with approximately 10(5) erythrocytes infected with chloroquine-resistant P.y. nigeriensis. At five to seven percent parasitaemia, the mice were randomly divided into five groups of five mice each. The first four groups were treated intraperitoneally for three consecutive days with different doses of the stock solution per mouse. The two extracts cleared the infection in a dose-dependent manner.
