We investigated the distribution of MRSA (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) on and around six patients with MRSA infection in our neurosurgical ward. All patients had a disturbance of consciousness and had sputum colonization of MRSA. Samples were obtained from 11 sites (patients' hands, attendances' hands, floors, sidetables, bedclothes, chairs, walls, curtains, door knobs, faucets and disposable gloves) in the patients' rooms by the wiping method. High counts of MRSA were detected on horizontal planes such as floors, sidetables and chairs, but MRSA was not detected on vertical planes such as curtains and walls. The reason why MRSA was detected on the horizontal planes was due to a fall of MRSA spread from sputum in the air. These findings indicate that the disinfection of horizontal planes is important for preventing the spread of MRSA. We also evaluated what disinfectant was useful for floor disinfection and concluded that 0.5% chlorhexidine digluconate (Hibitane) and 0.5% benzalkonium chloride (Osvan) were more effective than the other usually-used disinfectants such as alkyldiaminoethyl glycine (Tego-51).
