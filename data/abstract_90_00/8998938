Antibiograms received from veterinary laboratories during the 1990-1994 period were recorded and evaluated with the aid of a computer program. Based on 70 tables giving information about th most important pathogens, the resistance behaviour of E. coli in cattle, swine, chicken, and turkey, that of Pasteurella haemolytica and P. multocida in cattle and swine and that of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae in cattle have been in synoptic form. Attention is drawn to the increase in resistance to enrofloxacin shown by E. coli, particularly in turkeys.
