The in vitro susceptibilities of Pasteurella haemolytica biotypes A and T and P multocida from pneumonic ovine lungs to penicillin, ampicillin, oxytetracycline, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, kanamycin, neomycin, gentamicin, streptomycin and lincomycin were determined by the disk diffusion method. All the isolates were sensitive to chloramphenicol and resistant to lincomycin. The isolates of P haemolytica biotype A were consistently more sensitive to penicillin, ampicillin, oxytetracycline, erythromycin and streptomycin than those of biotype T.
