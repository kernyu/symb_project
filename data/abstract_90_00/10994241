Drug resistant tuberculosis has been recognized since chemotherapy first became available. However, drug resistance has increased in many countries, and recently strains resistant to both rifampicin and isoniazid (multidrug resistant tuberculosis) have emerged. This review discusses the epidemiology of multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDRTB), and the control of MDRTB in healthcare facilities. Relevant papers for this review were identified by a systematic literature search on Medline. MDRTB is already established world-wide, and although the overall problem of resistance remains low in the UK, it is of significant clinical importance due to its high case-fatality, higher transmission risk, and complex treatment. The key elements of MDRTB control are prompt recognition, confirmation and treatment of cases, and the institution of strict infection control procedures to reduce the airborne spread of infection from infectious patients to others. This review emphasizes the importance of a multidisciplinary approach to management, with liaison between tuberculosis physicians, the microbiology department, infection control team, consultant in communicable disease, and occupational health.
