The influence of protoplasting and protoplast regeneration in the presence of polyethylene glycol on antibiotic activity, components of antibiotic complexes and antibiotic resistance in Streptomyces hygroscopicus 155 was studied. It was shown that the protoplasting and protoplast regeneration influenced the antibiotic activity. The protoplast fusion resulted in increased isolation of variants with higher antibiotic activity. The processes also affected the components of the antibiotic complexes but had no effect on the strain resistance to some antibiotics.
