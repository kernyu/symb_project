Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 30 antimicrobial agents (including the hitherto unreported antimicrobial agents doxycycline, minocycline, vanomycin, 3 quinolones and 3 combinations of antimicrobial agents) for isolates of Salmonella spp. (20), Escherichia coli (17), Klebsiella spp. (8), Proteus spp. (7), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (7), Actinobacillus equuli (5), Rhodococcus equi (4), Streptococcus zooepidemicus (23), Streptococcus equisimilis (6), Streptococcus equi (4), coagulase-positive Staphylococcus spp. (20) and Taylorella equigenitalis (19) were determined using the agar dilution method. All isolates were of equine origin. MICs were compared with recommended MIC breakpoints. The results indicate that, for some of the pathogenic bacteria evaluated, susceptibility testing of isolates from the individual patient is essential to determine an appropriate antimicrobial treatment.
