Ideas prevailing in 1991 on hydrogen peroxide in the aqueous humor are outlined. They are critically examined under the light of our finding that the method used to establish aqueous humor levels of peroxide generates itself peroxide during the short time span of the analysis. This is due to the fact that the probe used, dichlorophenol indophenol (DCPIP), spontaneously auto-oxidizes in the presence of oxygen. It was concluded then that the level of hydrogen peroxide in the aqueous humor cannot be higher than about 0.3 microM, the detection limit of the DCPIP method. It was also concluded that the statement commonly made in the literature that aqueous humor hydrogen peroxide derives from the oxidation of ascorbate, an abundant component of that fluid, is based solely on the use of the DCPIP method, and so could easily be due to a methodological artifact. The same applies to the statement that the levels of hydrogen peroxide are very high in human senile cataracts. The surprising resistance to accept the results and conclusions of our 1992 publication is documented. Finally, the content is discussed of an oral presentation made at the 1997 ARVO Annual Meeting in which an important portion of our results and conclusions was confirmed, perhaps signaling a shift towards a wider acceptance of our findings.
