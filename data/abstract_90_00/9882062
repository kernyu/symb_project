Burn injury is a major public health problem in many areas of the world. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is one of the most common causes of burn wound infection in burn patients. Septicemia due to this organism is a major cause of mortality among burn patients. This study analyzed P. aeruginosa infections in the Tohid Burn Center in Tehran during 1995-1997 in order to estimate their frequency, antibiotic susceptibility and their role in burn morbidity. Among 2122 patients who were admitted during this study period, 3365 bacterial strains were isolated and the frequency of P. aeruginosa was 73.9%. This was followed by Staphylococcus aureus (9.1%) and other organisms (17%) in frequency. The frequency of P. aeruginosa resistant to gentamicin, carbenicillin, co-trimoxazole, ceftizoxime and tetracycline was over 95% and resistance to amikacin which was 49% in 1995, increased to 90% in 1997. With the introduction of ciprofloxacin at our burn center, the frequency of P. aeruginosa resistance increased from 45% in 1995, to 82% in 1997. P. aeruginosa was found more frequently in the ICU than in the wards. These findings show that P. aeruginosa remains the leading cause of nosocomial infections in our burn center. It is necessary to introduce urgent measures for restriction of the spread of P. aeruginosa infections in our burn center.
