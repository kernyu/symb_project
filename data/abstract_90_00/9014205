In the last decade, sub-Saharan Africa has experienced an explosive increase in tuberculosis (TB) cases, largely as a result of the co-epidemic of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. This article reviews the essential background epidemiology of TB in sub-Saharan Africa. The clinical features and diagnostic problems of pulmonary/extrapulmonary TB in adults and children are discussed, particularly in relation to HIV infection. Different treatment regimens, their cost, adverse reactions, the ways in which HIV infection influences treatment response and the extent of drug resistance are reviewed. The recommended approaches to TB control in Africa, including methods used to prevent TB through Bacillus Calmette-Guerin and chemoprophylaxis are examined. The success achieved by good National TB Control Programmes in some African countries allows cautious optimism that this epidemic can be controlled.
