Studies were performed to determine whether resistance to acute Toxoplasma gondii infection in mice depends on a mechanism involving CR3, the type 3 complement receptor. Nineteen of 22 mice (86%) given multiple injections of the anti-CR3 monoclonal antibody, 5C6, prior to and after intraperitoneal inoculation of cysts of the ordinarily mildly virulent ME49 strain of T. gondii died within 8 to 12 days, whereas control antibody-treated mice survived. All (five of five) anti-CR3-treated BALB/c mice infected via the natural peroral route died within 8 days of infection. Flow cytometric analysis of cells recovered from peritoneal lavages of anti-CR3-treated T. gondii-infected mice revealed that the percentage of Thy-1+ CD4- CD8- cells was reduced to about 50% of that of control antibody-treated mice and to about 20% of the number of such cells in controls. The numbers of macrophages, polymorphonuclear leukocytes, and lymphocytes recovered from the peritoneal cavities of T. gondii-infected mice were all reduced in anti-CR3-treated mice to about 40% of those of controls. In addition, anti-CR3-treated mice had less than 25% of the induced NK cell activity of the controls, and gamma interferon was reduced to undetectable levels. Thus, the rapid death of anti-CR3-treated mice was probably caused by impaired preimmune defenses. Histological examination of anti-CR3-treated T. gondii-infected mice revealed extensive liver pathology compared with that of infected mice given a control antibody or uninfected mice given anti-CR3. The inflammation, degeneration, and necrosis in most of the anti-CR3-treated mice were severe enough to account for the observed mortalities.
