The in vitro activity of cefetamet against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Serratia marcescens strains expressing an SHV-5-type beta-lactamase was evaluated. Most of the examined strains were susceptible to the antibiotic. Cefetamet was found to be considerably more active than ceftazidime and aztreonam. Its activity was comparable to that of cefotaxime. Cefetamet MIC values were related to the quantity of the enzyme expressed. The SHV-5-type enzyme hydrolysed cefetamet with an efficiency (Vmax/Km) similar to that of ceftazidime.
