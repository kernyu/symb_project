The antibiotic sensitivity of 696 cultures belonging to the family Vibrionaceae (V. cholerae O1, V. cholerae non-O1, V. albensis, V. parahaemolyticus, V. alginolyticus and Aeromonas spp.) was studied and general regularities of the antibiotic sensitivity were shown: a high sensitivity to broad-spectrum antibiotics (tetracycline and chloramphenicol) and a low sensitivity to ++beta lactams (carbenicillin and ampicillin). The comparative examinations revealed similarity in the antibioticograms of V. cholerae O1 (el Tor++), V. cholerae non-O1 and V. albensis, especially the latter two groups, as well as the tested halophilic Vibrio cultures by the range of the MICs, Mo, Me and the nature of the antibiotic resistance. Cultures of V. cholerae and luminescent Vibrio tended to preserve a high sensitivity. High resistance levels were noted in the halophilic Vibrio and Aeromonas cultures. No significant differences in the sensitivity of the strains of various origin (from man and environmental objects) were detected. However, several more resistant strains were isolated from the environmental objects.
