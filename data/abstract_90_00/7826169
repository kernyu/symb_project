Five strains of the genus Bacillus used as components of biological preparations i.e. bacterin SL, biosporin, bactisubtil and subalin were tested for their susceptibility to 38 antimicrobial agents, The strains were simultaneously resistant to 5 antibiotics: astreonam, colistin, penicillin, ceftizoxime and cefuroxime. High susceptibility of the strains to some penicillins, cephalosporins and aminoglycosides was recorded. The gene engineered strain B. subtilis 2335(105) marked by the kanamycin resistance gene showed cross resistance to amikacin and tobramycin. Trimetoprim, sulfotrimetoprim and norfloxacin proved to be active against the strains.
