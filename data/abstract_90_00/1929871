Long-term treatment of rats with isopropanol in the drinking water results in a change or process of adaptation occurring in in vitro brain protein synthesis which increases the resistance of the ribosomal machinery to the acute effect of either ethanol or isopropanol. Such an increase was observed both in the system coded by endogenous messenger and in the system coded by polyuridylic acid. In both translation systems, the adaptation seems to affect the ribosomal step of polypeptide chain elongation. The increase in resistance to the alkanols apparently did not affect the inhibitory action of puromycin, fusidic acid and cycloheximide on the ribosome.
