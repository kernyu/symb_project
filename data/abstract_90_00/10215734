BACKGROUND: Current guidelines for Helicobacter pylori eradication recommend 7 days of a proton-pump inhibitor, clarithromycin (C), and either metronidazole (M) or amoxycillin (A). A shorter course would be cheaper and could be as effective. AIM: This study was designed to investigate the efficacy of three 5-day regimens based on lansoprazole (L). METHODS: 168 dyspepsia patients with H. pylori infection were randomized to receive a 5-day course of either LCM, LAC or CALM, and a 13C-urea breath test was performed after 4 weeks to assess eradication. RESULTS: 160 patients completed the study. Intention-to-treat eradication rates were as follows: LCM 81%, LAC 59%, CALM 88%. LCM and CALM gave significantly better eradication rates than LAC. There was no significant difference in adverse events across the three groups. Logistical regression analysis showed that the specific regimen used and the age of the patient were the only factors influencing eradication outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Five days of CALM yields acceptable eradication rates, and is cheaper than conventional 7-day proton pump inhibitor-triple therapy. It appears to offer good results in metronidazole-resistant strains of H. pylori. A randomized trial comparing 5-day CALM with conventional 7-day therapy is needed before this regimen can be recommended for routine use.
