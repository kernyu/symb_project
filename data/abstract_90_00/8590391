The influence of analgesics at low concentrations on permeability and beta-lactamase expression have been studied "in vitro". The effect of these drugs on major outer membrane proteins and the lipopolysaccharide was evaluated. Acetylsalicylate and paracetamol induced modifications in susceptibility to a large variety of antibiotics when tested at therapeutic concentrations. The results suggested that when analgesics and antibiotics are administered simultaneously, the interaction between both kinds of drugs can alter the response of microorganisms to antibiotics.
