The in-vitro activity of a new glycopeptide antibiotic, LY333328, was compared with vancomycin and teicoplanin against clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, vancomycin and teicoplanin resistant enterococci, and vancomycin sensitive and resistant enterococci. MIC, MBC, and time-kill kinetics were determined for each agent. LY333328 displayed similar or improved MIC/MBC values in comparison with vancomycin and teicoplanin. Time-kill kinetics for LY333328 demonstrated significantly improved bactericidal activity against the isolates. These findings suggest that LY333328 has improved in-vitro activity over vancomycin and teicoplanin against a range of gram-positive organisms.
