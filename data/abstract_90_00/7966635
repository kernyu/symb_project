We previously reported that a clone of a human lymphocytic cell line, HPBMa clone 10-2, supports the genome replication of hepatitis C virus (HCV). In the present study, the multicycle transmission of HCV from infected cells to new cells was demonstrated by coculture with drug-resistant cells as recipients; i.e., the system was proved productive for infectious HCV. Inhibition of viral replication by alpha and beta interferons was observed.
