A theoretical method for estimating limiting stage of oxygen mass transfer is proposed. The method is based on calculation and comparison of particular resistance of separate stages of mass transfer: mass transfer through the gas-liquid boundary, oxygen transport in the liquid phase, mass transfer through the liquid-cell boundary and oxygen consumption by microbial cells. With the proposed method, particular resistance was calculated and conditions for oxygen mass transfer were analyzed in the biosynthesis of sisomicin as an example. As a result the conditions for reproducibility of the process in apparatus of various size were determined.
