The prevalence and molecular characteristics of penicillinase-producing Neisseria gonorrhoeae (PPNG) and tetracycline-resistant N. gonorrhoeae (TRNG) were determined in 10 clinics in Monrovia, Liberia, to assess the likely effectiveness of the current standard treatment with penicillin or tetracycline. One hundred gonococcal strains were isolated from 146 urethral swabs and 261 cervical swabs and screened for susceptibility to ceftriaxone, penicillin, spectinomycin and tetracycline by the disk diffusion method; 83% were resistant to penicillin and 63% to tetracycline. Twenty-one strains from 18 men and 3 women with uncomplicated gonorrhoea were subjected to more detailed characterization. These 21 strains belonged to 5 auxotype/serovar classes; 86% were PPNG/TRNG. Three PPNG harboured the 4.4 MDa penicillinase plasmid and 16 the 3.2 MDa plasmid. All TRNG harboured the 25.2 MDa plasmid and their MICs for tetracycline were > 32 mg/L. They gave a PCR product which, according to its restriction pattern, corresponded to the American type tetM gene. By the agar dilution method, all strains exhibited intermediate resistance to sulphamethoxazole-trimethoprim (19:1) (co-trimoxazole) with MICs of 8-32 mg/L. All strains were susceptible to spectinomycin and ciprofloxacin. The MICs for gentamicin were 4-8 mg/L. The use of effective and affordable antimicrobial chemotherapy with either 500 mg ciprofloxacin or a single dose of gentamicin is discussed, with consideration of molecular biological, pharmacological and public health aspects.
