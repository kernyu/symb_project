We report a 21-year-old male with childhood-onset familial nephrotic syndrome and frequent relapses who manifested toxicity or treatment resistance to corticosteroids, cyclophosphamide, cyclosporin-A, and tacrolimus. Monotherapy with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) resulted in maintenance of clinical remission for 14 months without noticeable toxicity, while allowing resolution of steroid-induced side effects. Our observation suggests that MMF may be useful in maintaining remission in nephrotic patients who manifest toxicity to standard immunosuppressive agents.
