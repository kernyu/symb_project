In order to elucidate the role of the host as a factor in the spread of chloroquine resistance, a study of the host's immune responses in chloroquine resistant (cqr) and chloroquine sensitive (cqs) Plasmodial infections is essential. Course of the infection and the nature of immune responses in mice infected with chloroquine resistant (R) and chloroquine sensitive (S) strains of Plasmodium berghei were compared. Crude parasite antigen activated T cells from both the groups of mice (R and S) and the parasite specific antibodies were detected in the sera of both the groups. The differences in immune responses between the control (uninfected) and infected mice were found to be significant. However, humoral and in vitro cellular responses obtained with T cells from chloroquine resistant P. berghei primed mice was lower in comparison with the responses obtained with T cells from the sensitive infections. Our studies therefore suggest that immunosuppression to parasite antigen is seen in mice primed with chloroquine resistant P. berghei, which may play a role in the development of resistance.
