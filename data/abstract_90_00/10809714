Rickettsia prowazekii, the etiologic agent of epidemic typhus, is an obligate, intracytoplasmic, parasitic bacterium. Recently, the transformation of this bacterium via electroporation has been reported. However, in these studies identification of transformants was dependent upon either selection of an R. prowazekii rpoB chromosomal mutation imparting rifampin resistance or expression of the green fluorescent protein and flow cytometric analysis. In this paper we describe the expression in R. prowazekii of the Escherichia coli ereB gene. This gene codes for an erythromycin esterase that cleaves erythromycin. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of the expression of a nonrickettsial, antibiotic-selectable gene in R. prowazekii. The availability of a positive selection for rickettsial transformants is an important step in the characterization of genetic analysis systems in the rickettsiae.
