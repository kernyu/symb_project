Twenty-five women with acute inflammations of the uterine tubes were examined using Doppler studies of the internal iliac, uterine, and ovarian arteries over the course of therapy. The systolic/diastolic ratio (A/B) and the Pourcelot resistance index were used in analysis of the spectral curves. The findings evidence that the iliac artery blood flow was unchanged over the course of therapy. Dopplerometric curves of the uterine and ovarian arteries were plotted for various periods of therapy for acute salpingo-oophoritis . The authors come to a conclusion of the usefulness of Doppler studies in clinical practice, and these conclusions are supported by the results of statistical data processing.
