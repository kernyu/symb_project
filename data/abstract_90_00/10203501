The results of prevalence studies on glycopeptide-resistant enterococci (GRE) in the intestine may be influenced by the detection methods applied. In most studies different media, different concentrations of antibiotics, and different methods are used, and these differences result in differences in recovery rates. In this cross-sectional study on the carrier state of GRE among patients at the University Hospital Antwerp, Antwerp, Belgium, performed on 21 May 1996, direct plating and broth enrichment were compared by using the same media. Stool samples (n = 213) or rectal swabs (n = 122) were plated directly on Enterococcosel agar (bioMerieux) and after enrichment in Enterococcosel broth. The prevalence of GRE was 12.8%. Direct plating recovered 53.4% of the GRE isolates, and broth enrichment recovered an additional 46.5% of them; in the latter test the isolates were thus present at less than 10(3) CFU per g of feces. The prevalence of GRE among dialysis patients was higher than among the other patients, but the difference was not significant (P = 0.06), possibly as a result of the small numbers of dialysis patients examined. The GRE species isolated included 19 E. gallinarum (44.2%), 13 E. faecium (30.2%), 6 E. faecalis (13.9%), and 5 E. casseliflavus (11.6%) isolates. All E. faecalis and E. faecium strains isolated carried the vanA gene, and E. gallinarum and E. casseliflavus carried the vanC1 and vanC2 gene, respectively. The majority of isolates were polyclonal. Our data indicate that the rate of detection of GRE from both stool samples and rectal swabs is significantly increased with enrichment cultures.
