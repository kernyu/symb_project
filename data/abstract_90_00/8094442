Exposure of growing cells of Escherichia coli strain AB1157 to a frequency of 1 Hz with field strengths of 1 or 3 kV m-1 did not affect spontaneous or ultraviolet light (UV)-induced mutation frequencies to rifampicin resistance. Neither did growth in the presence of charge alter the sensitivities of strains AB1157, TK702 umuC or TK501 umuC uvrB to UV. Similarly, although the resistance of strains TK702 umuC and TK501 umuC uvrB to UV was increased by the presence of plasmid pKM101, which carries DNA repair genes, pregrowth of plasmid-containing strains in electric fields did not increase UV resistance. Finally, growth in a low frequency field in the presence of sub-inhibitory concentrations of mitomycin C did not affect mitomycin C-induced mutation frequencies. It is concluded that low frequency electromagnetic fields do not increase spontaneous mutation, induce DNA repair or increase the mutagenic effects of UV or mitomycin C.
