Mutant prevention concentration (MPC) has been proposed as a new measure of antibiotic potency by which the ability to restrict selection of resistant mutants is evaluated. To determine whether MPC provides potency information unavailable from the more customary measurement of the MIC, 18 fluoroquinolones were examined for their ability to block the growth of Mycobacterium smegmatis and to select resistant mutants from wild-type populations. Both MPC and MIC were affected by changes in the moiety at the fluoroquinolone C-8 position and in alkyl groups attached to the C-7 piperazinyl ring. When eight resistant mutants, altered in the gyrase A protein, were tested with fluoroquinolones having either a methoxy or a hydrogen at the C-8 position, the MIC for the most resistant mutant correlated better with the MPC than did the MIC for wild-type cells. For C-8-fluorine derivatives, which were generally less active than the C-8-methoxy compounds but which were more active than C-8-hydrogen derivatives, the MICs for both the mutant and the wild type correlated well with the MPCs. Thus, measurement of the MICs for wild-type cells can reflect the ability of a quinolone to restrict the selection of resistance, but often it does not. With the present series of compounds, the most potent contained a C-8-methoxy and a small group attached to the C-7 ring.
