Faecal egg count reduction tests and an anthelmintic efficiency assay were used to assess the efficacy of combinations of albendazole sulphoxide and levamisole against populations of Ostertagia and Trichostrongylus sp. which contained different proportions of worms resistant to both benzimidazole and levamisole anthelmintics. Compared to the effects of either drug alone, significantly greater efficacy was obtained using combinations which included dose rates similar to those recommended for the separate components. At these dose rates, the mixtures reduced mean faecal egg counts by 95% or more, and caused a reduction of 68% in adult Ostertagia sp. and more than 95% for 4th stage Ostertagia and T colubriformis. The increased efficacy of the mixtures could be accounted for by actions of the drugs acting independently.
