There is evidence that immunoglobulin (Ig) E antibody may be a critical component of protective immunity against Schistosoma mansoni and S. haematobium reinfection. In the present study, 555 individuals aged 3-67 years infected with S.japonicum received praziquantel treatment before the transmission season commenced; 45 d later, blood samples from 265 individuals who had no S. japonicum egg in their stool were examined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for specific isotypic antibodies. Single, non-conditional logistic regression analysis showed that exposure intensity, age, soluble egg antigen (SEA)-IgE, SEA-IgM and soluble adult worm antigen-IgG4 were relevant to reinfection; multiple, non-conditional logistic regression analysis showed that exposure intensity was still a significant factor for reinfection while the SEA-IgE antibody level was associated with resistance to reinfection with S. japonicum, with a protective index of 2.00. It is suggested that this population in an area endemic for schistosomiasis japonica exhibits acquired immunity.
