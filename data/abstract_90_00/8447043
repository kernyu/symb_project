Because of the many newly developed chemotherapeutics it is often hard to choose the most suitable substance for treatment of urinary tract infection (UTI). Substances for first-line oral treatment are the benzylpyrimidine/sulphonamide combinations, amino-penicillins, fluoroquinolones and cephalosporins. In severe infections any of these can be given i.v., as can amino-glycosides or the combination of imipenem and cilastin. It is easier to decide which substance to give before urine culture results are available if the local resistance patterns to the typical pathogens are known. Particular care is mandatory for risk groups such as children, pregnant women, immunocompromised patients and those with renal insufficiency. Before treatment clinical classification of UTI is necessary. In acute uncomplicated cystitis oral antibiotics should be given either as single-shot therapy or over 3 days. In acute uncomplicated pyelonephritis therapy should last for 7 days or until 3 days after fever is gone. If enteral absorption is not guaranteed or in complicated cases of UTI, intravenous drugs should be used for 10-14 days until fever is gone or the complicating factor has been corrected.
