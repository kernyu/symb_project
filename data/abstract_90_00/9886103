Malaria in Timika area, south central Irian Jaya, is a public health problem causing morbidity and mortality, particularly to the vulnerable age group. In August/September 1992 malariometric surveys were conducted simultaneously with sensitivity studies of Plasmodium falciparum to antimalarials, and bionomics of vectors in six villages around Timika (Mwapi, Kaugapu, Hiripau, Pomako, Mapurujaya, Kwamki Lama). The average overall spleen rate was 44.0%, the highest rate observed in Kwamki Lama (68.3%) and the lowest in Mapurujaya (13.7%). The average parasite rate in children aged 2-9 years was 60.6%. The highest rate was found in Mwapi (92.0%) and the lowest rate in Mapurujaya (4.8%). In the study area the dominant species was P. falciparum, (except in Kaugapu), followed by P. vivax. P. malariae and P. ovale were not observed. In vivo sensitivity studies done in 7 villages showed P. falciparum was resistant to chloroquine [51.3% S/R I (sensitive or 1st grade resistant), 43.6% R II and 5.1% R III] in Kwamki Lama, SP I and SP II (transmigrant settlements) and Timika health service center. In vitro sensitivity test in Kwamki Lama, SP I, SP II and Timika health service center showed 64.4% resistant to chloroquine, and remain sensitive to sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine, quinine and mefloquine. Vector studies revealed that Anophelese punctulatus and An. koliensis were the potential vectors as was confirmed by ELISA positive test with a sporozoite rate of 1.43% and 0.33% respectively. The vectors were indoor and outdoor resting.
