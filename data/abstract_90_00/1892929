The antimicrobial susceptibilities of 421 Pasteurella haemolytica and 158 P. multocida isolates recovered from cattle with respiratory disease were determined with a microdilution minimal inhibitory concentration test system. Isolates were analyzed for patterns of resistance to ampicillin, ceftiofur, erythromycin, gentamicin, penicillin, spectinomycin, sulfachlorpyridazine, sulfadimethoxine, tetracycline, and tylosin. All isolates tested were found susceptible to ceftiofur and sulfachlorpyridazine. Pasteurella haemolytica isolates were resistant to ampicillin, penicillin, sulfadimethoxine, tetracycline, and tylosin. Pasteurella multocida isolates were resistant to sulfadimethoxine, tetracycline, and tylosin.
