Fluoroquinolone efflux was studied in 47 Staphylococcus aureus clinical strains with MICs of ciprofloxacin (CFX) of < or = 2 micrograms/ml. Forty-three strains were wild type for gyrA, gyrB, and grlA quinolone resistance-determining regions and for norA and its promoter region. Forty of these strains (MICs of CFX, 0.1 to 0.2 microgram/ml) did not show efflux of fluoroquinolones. Three strains (MICs of CFX, 1 to 2 micrograms/ml) showed efflux. These results suggest that efflux can appear in S. aureus clinical strains in the absence of mutations in norA and its promoter.
