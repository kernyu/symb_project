Four calves were infected with a susceptible (laboratory) strain of Ostertagia ostertagi and four with a field strain suspected to be resistant to benzimidazoles. After 25 days two calves from each group were treated with 3.5 mg kg-1 fenbendazole. Egg output fell to zero in all treated calves. Treated calves did not harbour worms at slaughter 35 days after infection. Significant differences between the strains were shown for ED50 values for thiabendazole in the egg hatch assay, but not in the tubulin binding assay. It is concluded that benzimidazole resistance in the suspected strain cannot be confirmed.
