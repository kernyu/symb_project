The author discussed the results of investigations concerning pathogenic bacterial flora variation causing infection in a surgery ward. Data obtained in the period 1995-1996 were analysed. Covering 118 cases of postoperative infections and 72 cases of primary infections, treated surgically. To establish drug-sensitivity of the bacteria causing infections, the infected samples were taken from all these patients. It was found that different kinds of bacteria caused the postoperative and the primary infections. It was also noted that there was different progress in drug-resistance in each group. The author thing that drug-resistance monitoring in a surgery ward can make antibiotic choice easier in the case of infections, before establishing drug-sensitivity of infection-causing bacteria.
