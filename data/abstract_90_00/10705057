The AUXACOLOR colorimetric system (Sanofi Diagnostics Pasteur, Marnes-la-Coquette, France) for the identification of clinical yeast isolates, was compared in its identification of 100 yeast strains to conventional identification methods. Of the 94 correctly identified isolates, 47% (n = 44) were identified by 24 h, and 100% (n = 94) were identified by 48 h. AUXACOLOR is a simple, rapid and accurate method for the identification of yeast pathogens.
