Agarose-immobilized chromosomal DNA from the nalidixic-acid-resistant Campylobacter coli strain UA417 and its streptomycin-resistant (StrR) derivative, UA417R, were digested with the restriction enzymes SalI (GTCGAC) and SmaI (CCCGGG). The sizes of the resulting fragments were determined using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. The two genomes showed similar restriction patterns of seven and 13 fragments for the two respective enzymes and the total genome size was determined to be approx. 1.7 Mb. Analysis of partial digestion fragments, as well as Southern-blot hybridization, were used to construct a physical map of the C. coli UA417R genome. Natural transformation studies using DNA fragments extracted from UA417R, as well as the erythromycin-resistant (EryR) C. coli strain UA585, were used to locate the StrR and EryR resistance markers on the genomic map.
