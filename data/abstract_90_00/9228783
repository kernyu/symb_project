SHV-6 was previously identified by its susceptibility pattern and biochemical criteria in a clinical isolate of Klebsiella pneumoniae which was resistant to ceftazidime. It contains only a single point difference with the beta laSHV-1 gene as determined by PCR amplification and nucleotide sequencing. This is the result of a single amino acid substitution, Ala for Asp, at position 179. Directed mutagenesis experiments have shown this substitution to confer selective resistance to ceftazidime in the TEM family.
