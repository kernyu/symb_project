In vitro data on bacterial susceptibility to cefaclor were collected from clinical trials conducted in 15 European countries, South Africa, Canada, and the United States. Among the respiratory pathogens, 94% of Haemophilus influenzae, 98.6% of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 98.8% of Streptococcus pyogenes, and 98.1% of Moraxella catarrhalis were susceptible to cefaclor. Over 90% of the tested isolates of the most common urinary tract pathogen, Escherichia coli, were susceptible to cefaclor. Virtually all of the pathogens that may infect skin and soft tissues, S pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible strains), were cefaclor susceptible. These data confirm that the major pathogens in bacterial infections of the upper and lower respiratory tract, of the skin and related structures, and of the urinary tract remain susceptible to cefaclor after more than 13 years of widespread clinical use.
