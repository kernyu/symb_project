The efficacy and the safety of panipenem/betamipron (PAPM/BP), a new carbapenem antibiotic against infections in pediatrics were studied. The obtain results are summarized as follows. 1. The transfer of PAPM/BP to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was studied in 2 cases of purulent meningitis. The PAPM/BP levels in CSF in a dose 26.1 mg/kg peaked at 3.21 micrograms/ml on sampling 30 minutes after administration, followed by decreasing gradually with the improvement in clinical symptoms and came to 0.86 micrograms/ml on the 12th day (30 minutes after administration). 2. PAPM/BP at dose levels of 50 mg/kg to 69 mg/kg a day (daily doses of 104 mg/kg, 175 mg/kg 4 times a day for 2 cases of purulent meningitis) was administered by intravenous drip infusion 3 times daily for 4 to 15 days to 2 cases of purulent meningitis (including 1 case of penicillin-resistant Streptococcus penumoniae meningitis), 3 cases of pneumonia, 2 cases of phlegmon, 2 cases of periproctal abscess and 2 cases of urinary tract infections for a total of 11 cases. As results, all the cases showed good responses including 5 excellent and 6 good responses. Bacteriological efficacies in all of the 9 eligible cases were assessed as "eradicated". 3. As for the safety, an increase in the platelet count and slight evaluation of GOT and GPT were seen in 1 case as abnormal changes in the laboratory findings, although no side-effect was observed. 4. The results above show that PAPM/BP is useful for the treatment of general infections in pediatrics and that a daily dose of about 60 mg/kg given in 3 divided doses in effective enough.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
