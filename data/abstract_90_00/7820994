To obtain data about the prevalence of resistance in bacterial isolates causing serious infections in the Netherlands, a multicenter survey was carried out using the Etest for quantitative susceptibility testing. More than 6000 isolates belonging to ten species were tested against eight antibiotics. Moreover, the Etest was validated against the agar dilution method and the reproducibility of the Etest was studied. In spite of pH differences between the agar plates used for Etesting and agar dilution testing, a good correlation (that is 86%-97% within log2 dilution steps) was found between both methods. Comparison of Etest values of the participating laboratories and the reference laboratory showed > 80% conformity within 1 log2 dilution step and 90% within 2 log2 dilution steps, indicating a sufficient reproducibility of the Etest. Resistance percentages were low for most species and antibiotics, relatively high percentages (10%-20%) indicating natural insusceptibility rather than development or increase of resistance.
