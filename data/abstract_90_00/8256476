Since alpha-interferon has been introduced an efficient therapy of chronic active hepatitis has become available for the first time. Among some of the treated patients, however, alpha-interferon therapy causes typical side effects. Fever, chills, loss of weight, fatigue as well as arthralgia, myalgia, loss of concentration and hematologic side effects have to be mentioned in particular. We report the occurrence of a diabetes mellitus under alpha-interferon therapy. The metabolic disorder gradually normalized after 3 weeks of antidiabetic treatment, although the interferon medication had been continued. We consider this disorder to be an effect caused by the alpha-interferon. The underlying mechanism might be an insulin resistance or an autoimmunologic defect. For that reason, when administering alpha-interferon, we recommend regular analyses of the blood sugar level during the regular patient monitoring.
