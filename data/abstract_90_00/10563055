Bacteria resistant to antibiotic therapy are becoming much more common and this has led to mounting concern in the UK and worldwide. Many pathogens are now 'multiresistant', that is, they are resistant to several classes of antimicrobial drug. Infection with such organisms may be particularly difficult to treat. In this article, we briefly discuss how resistance and multiresistance occur. We consider some of the important pathogens involved and the problems they pose in hospitals and the community. We discuss strategies for slowing the accumulation of antibiotic resistance and the implications for doctors treating patients with common infections.
