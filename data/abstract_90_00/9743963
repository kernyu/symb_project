BACKGROUND: Colonization with multidrug-resistant vancomycin-resistant-enterococci (VRE) could become a serious problem, since there is no proven therapy in case of an infection or in case of transfer of glycopeptid-resistance to other organisms. PATIENTS: Description of 24 from 48 pediatric oncology patients with VRE-colonization. METHODS: Stool samples were taken from all patients of our pediatric oncology unit from March 1996 until June 1997. Barrier isolation was introduced in May 1996, a prudent use of glycopeptid antibiotica in July 1996. RESULTS: 193 stool sample examinations demonstrated that 24 (50%) of the 48 patients were colonized with VRE. 11 (46%) of these 24 patients were VRE-carriers at the time of their first examination; 9 (37%) patients acquired VRE during their therapy and 4 (17%) patients had come from other hospitals and already were VRE-positive when they entered our unit. In March 1997, one year after the outbreak only four patients still were VRE-positive, in June 1997 all of them were VRE-negative. The average time of colonization was 12.5 weeks. 17 (70%) of the 24 colonized patients had received glycopeptide antibiotics, 16 of them within two months before the appearance of VRE in their stool. Five colonized patients died, four of them because of their oncological illness, one because of a sepsis without proof of VRE in his blood. In the end none of our patients suffered from a VRE-infection, and besides that, the transfer of glycopeptid-resistance to other organisms was not observed. CONCLUSION: With barrier isolation and a very restrictive use of glycopeptid-antibiotica, colonization can be decreased and even stopped. Inspite of the high number of colonized patients no VRE-infectious disease occurred.
