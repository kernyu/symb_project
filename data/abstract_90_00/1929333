In an attempt to control the spread of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) within a spinal cord injury unit, we investigated the mode of transmission and implemented a multidisciplinary approach for control that consisted of grouping of patients into cohorts, contact isolation, and antibiotics. Surveillance cultures of patients and nose and hand cultures of medical personnel were performed. Of 11 colonized patients, 6 had MRSA isolates that shared a similar plasmid profile and antibiogram, raising the possibility of interpatient spread of the organism. Medical personnel had no evident role in transmitting MRSA. All patients' pretherapy MRSA isolates were susceptible to minocycline and, except for one, to rifampin. Time-kill studies showed an indifferent interaction of these two antibiotics. Ten colonized patients received a 2-week oral course of 100 mg of minocycline twice daily and 600 mg of rifampin once daily, while the 11th patient was treated for only 1 week. Patients with colonization of the nares also had twice daily nasal application of 2% mupirocin for 5 days. Colonization with MRSA cleared in 10 of 11 patients (91%) and 20 of 21 sites (95%). When the individual circumstances of a medical facility justify eradication of MRSA colonization, a multidisciplinary approach that includes antibiotic therapy with oral minocycline and rifampin, along with topical mupirocin for those with nasal carriage, may be successful.
