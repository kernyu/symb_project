Adaptive resistance to aminoglycosides in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other gram-negative bacilli is usually induced by the initial exposure to the drug. We investigated the influence of pH on the adaptive resistance of a clinical P. aeruginosa strain to aminoglycosides in vitro and on their postantibiotic effects. For adaptive resistance, the first-exposure concentrations of both amikacin and netilmicin were one, two, four, and eight times the MIC of each drug and the second-exposure concentrations were two times the MIC of each drug. Adaptive resistance was greater and more prolonged with higher initial aminoglycoside concentrations, and the bactericidal effects of the aminoglycosides were concentration dependent at pH 7.4. At pH 6.5, the killing rates of amikacin and netilmicin were far lower than those observed at pH 7.4. At pH 5.5, amikacin and netilmicin exerted practically no bactericidal effect on the P. aeruginosa strain used. However, with media at pH 5.5 and 6.5, adaptive resistance of P. aeruginosa preexposed to amikacin and netilmicin was also clearly exhibited, with the degree of adaptive resistance depending on the bactericidal effects of both drugs on nonpreexposed controls. Maximal adaptive resistance occurred between 0 and 4 h after preexposure. The postantibiotic effects of amikacin and netilmicin against the P. aeruginosa strain were shown to be concentration dependent and were reduced at acidic pHs. No changes in outer and inner membrane proteins occurred during the adaptive-resistance interval.
