Hyperglycemia induces insulin resistance in diabetic patients. It is known that supraphysiological levels of D-glucose or 2-deoxyglucose inhibit the insulin receptor and it is speculated that this effect is mediated by serine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor beta-subunit and other proteins of the insulin signaling chain. To test this hypothesis we prepared point mutations of the human insulin receptor where serine was exchanged to alanine at 16 different positions, either at known phosphorylation sites or at positions which are conserved in different tyrosine kinase receptors. These receptor constructs were expressed in HEK 293 cells and the effect of 2-deoxyglucose (25 mM) on insulin (100 nM) induced receptor autophosphorylation was studied. 2-Deoxyglucose consistently inhibits insulin stimulated autophosphorylation of all constructs to the same degree as observed in wild-type human insulin receptor. The data suggest that none of the chosen serine positions are involved in 2-deoxyglucose induced receptor inhibition.
