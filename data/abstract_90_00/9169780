Defensins are antibiotic peptides expressed in human and animal myeloid and epithelial cells. Due to the limited availability of natural peptides, the properties of human epithelial defensins have not been studied. We assayed the microbicidal activity of recombinant human intestinal defensin 5 (rHD-5) in the presence of salt (O to 150 mM NaCl) with varied pH (pH 5.5 to pH 8.5) and trypsin (25 and 250 microg/ml). rHD-5 exhibits microbicidal activity against Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli, and Candida albicans. In contrast to cryptdins, the mouse intestinal defensins, rHD-5 is active against both mouse-virulent wild-type Salmonella typhimurium and its isogenic, mouse-avirulent phoP mutant. In the presence of salt, rHD-5 activity was reduced, and at 100 mM NaCl, activity against S. typhimurium was abolished. However, at all salt concentrations tested, rHD-5 remained bactericidal to L. monocytogenes. Activity against L. monocytogenes was not pH dependent but was diminished at pH 5.5 against wild-type S. typhimurium. This acid-induced resistance may have been mediated by the virulence gene regulator phoP, since the phoP mutant was equally sensitive at pH 5.5 and pH 7.4. In the presence of trypsin, rHD-5 was partially cleaved, but even then, rHD-5 at 100 microg/ml decreased the number of CFU of wild-type S. typhimurium by more than 99%. The persistence of microbicidal activity of rHD-5 under these conditions supports the notion that naturally occurring human intestinal defensin is an effective arm of mucosal host defense.
