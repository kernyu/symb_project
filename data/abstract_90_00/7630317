2',3'-Dideoxycytidine (ddC) is a nucleoside analogue that inhibits HIV-1 replication in vitro and is currently used in AIDS therapy. This compound exerts a delayed cytotoxicity due to inhibition of mitochondrial DNA (mDNA) synthesis. We have found that long term exposure of U937 human monoblastoid cells to ddC allowed the selection of a drug-resistant cell line (U937-R) with 66% mDNA, normal ddC transport and altered deoxycytidine kinase kinetic properties. In this paper we show that U937-R cells contain an increased number of mitochondria per cell and a reduced copy number of mDNA/mitochondria. Furthermore, the intracellular concentrations of deoxycytidine 5'-triphosphate (dCTP) and 2',3'-dideoxycytidine 5'-triphosphate (ddCTP) are also reduced although with a higher dCTP/ddCTP ratio in U937-R compared to the parental cells. This mechanism of drug resistance, with drug-resistance based on viral mutations, can provide an explanation for drug failure in antiviral therapy.
