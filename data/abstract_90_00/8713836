Analysis of experimental populations of Drosophila has shown different selective value of S- and F-alleles of Adh locus under selection for delayed aging, resistance to elevated temperature and ethanol. Selection for delayed aging and resistance to hyperthermia was accompanied by an increase of Adhs frequency in populations and genotypic adaptation to ethanol- by an increase of AdhF frequency.
