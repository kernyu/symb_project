The effects of voriconazole on the growth, ultrastructure, and leakage of cytoplasmic materials of Candida species were investigated. MIC data showed that voriconazole was more active than fluconazole. Exposure of yeast to voriconazole caused growth inhibition, cell wall thinning, and cell membrane degradation. Neither cell collapse nor release of cytoplasmic materials was observed in the treated cells.
