Isolates of Actinobacillus (Haemophilus) pleuropheumoniae were studied by restriction endonuclease fingerprinting (REF) analysis using the enzymes BamHI and HindIII. Restriction fragments were resolved by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualized by silver staining. Except for serotypes 1 and 9, reference strains of A. pleuropneumoniae serotypes 1 to 10 had clearly distinguishable REF profiles. Analysis of REF profiles of southern Ontario field isolates revealed limited heterogeneity amongst isolates of serotype 1 or serotype 5. The REF profiles of the serotype 7 isolates studied showed greater variation. Heterogeneity could not be correlated with the presence of plasmids nor with antibiotic resistance. Limited heterogeneity could also be detected amongst REF profiles of A. pleuropneumoniae isolates recovered from a closed herd suggesting that there is a small amount of genetic variation within clonal populations.
