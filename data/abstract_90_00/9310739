Oral and topical antibiotics play a major role in acne therapy. Physicians base treatment choices on personal perceptions of efficacy, cost-effectiveness or risk-benefit ratios and rarely take bacterial resistance into account. Propionibacterium acnes isolates resistant to one or more anti-acne antibiotics have been reported in Europe, the USA, Japan and New Zealand. Therapeutic failure on some but not all antibiotic regimens is an increasing management problem. In Leeds, UK, resistant strains are found in 60% of acne patients and 50% of close contacts. Recommendations for the use of antibiotics in acne therapy to help prevent the emergence of resistance in P. acnes include the implementation of antibiotic usage policies and the encouragement of improved prescribing habits. Strategies to reduce the resistant P. acnes population are necessary. This paper reports preliminary data demonstrating that oral isotretinoin (Roaccutane/Accutane) significantly reduces total numbers of resistant P. acnes on the skin of all patients.
