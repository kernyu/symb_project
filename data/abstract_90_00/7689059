The ability of cyclosporin A, FK506, and rapamycin to overcome multidrug resistance was investigated in Chinese hamster ovary cells in vitro by growth inhibition experiments. 1-30 microM of immunosuppressant sensitized drug-resistant cells and their drug-sensitive parents in a dose-dependent manner to adriamycin (2-2000-fold), colchicine (2-260-fold), and vinblastine (2-120-fold). The multidrug resistance-reversing activity increased in the order rapamycin < FK506 < cyclosporin A, irrespective of whether the resistant cells overexpressed hamster or human P-glycoprotein. The interaction of the three macrolides with P-glycoprotein was characterized by their ability to competitively inhibit the photoaffinity labelling of plasma membranes of resistant CHRB30 cells by iodomycin. The three immunosuppressants bound with high affinity to P-glycoprotein.
