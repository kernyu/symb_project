One hundred sixteen unrelated clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus (70 ciprofloxacin resistant and 46 ciprofloxacin susceptible) from eight countries were studied for the presence of mutations in the grlA, grlB, gyrA, and gyrB gene loci. Two mutations within grlA (located at codons 80 and 84) and two mutations within gyrA (located at codons 84 and 88) were clearly associated with ciprofloxacin resistance, although other mutations detected within the four genes studied may also contribute to decreased susceptibility.
