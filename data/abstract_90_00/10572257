In this work we report the disruption of a Saccharomyces cerevisiae ORF YBR008c (FLR1 gene) within the context of EUROFAN (EUROpean Functional Analysis Network) six-pack programme, using a PCR-mediated gene replacement protocol as well as the results of the basic phenotypic analysis of a deletant strain and the construction of a disruption cassette for inactivation of this gene in any yeast strain. We also show results extending the knowledge of the range of compounds to which FLR1 gene confers resistance to the antimitotic systemic benzimidazole fungicide benomyl and the antitumor agent methotrexate, reinforcing the concept that the FLR1 gene is a multidrug resistance (MDR) determinant. Our conclusions were based on the higher susceptibility to these compounds of flr1Delta compared with wild-type and on the increased resistance of both flr1Delta and wild-type strains upon increased expression of FLR1 gene from a centromeric plasmid clone. The present study also provides, for the first time, evidence that the adaptation of yeast cells to growth in the presence of benomyl involves the dramatic activation of FLR1 gene expression during benomyl-induced latency (up to 400-fold). Results obtained using a FLR1-lacZ fusion in a plasmid indicate that the activation of FLR1 expression in benomyl-stressed cells is under the control of the transcriptional regulator Pdr3p. Indeed, PDR3 deletion severely reduces benomyl-induced activation of FLR1 gene expression (by 85%), while the homologous Pdr1p transcription factor is apparently not involved in this activation.
