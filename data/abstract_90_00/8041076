The method of indirect electrochemical detoxification by means of sodium hypochlorite (NaClO) obtained by isotonic NaCl solution electrolysis on a [symbol: see text] device consists in modeling hepatic monooxygenase detoxifying function on cytochrome B-450. Indirect electrochemical detoxification was conducted in more than 200 patients with generalized abdominal pyo-inflammatory processes and marked intoxication syndrome. Sodium hypochlorite was used for intravenous treatment of endotoxicosis in concentrations of 600 mg/l and 300 mg/l in volumes of 1/10 and 1/6 CBV in patients with generalized fibrinopurulent peritonitis and pancreonecrosis and for local administration during programmed prophylactic treatment of the abdominal cavity. The detoxifying effect was best in patients with grade 2-3-intoxication (according to V. K. Gostishchev et al., 1989). Local use of NaClO was marked by a high necrolytic effect, antiseptic properties, capability for reducing the resistance of the microflora to antibiotics, etc. The work discusses the methods of hypochlorite application, indications, contraindications, possible complications and their prevention.
