Thirty Campylobacter jejuni (C. jejuni) strains isolated from stools of Israeli children with enteritis were tested for sensitivity to eight antimicrobial agents (MIC) and the presence of plasmids. It was found that all the isolates were sensitive to ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, furazolidone and erythromycin. Of the 30 strains tested, 21 (70%) were found to be tetracycline-resistant, a relatively high resistance rate as compared with data from other countries and previous reports from Israel. Plasmids were detected in 17 out of 30 C. jejuni isolates (55.6%). A total of nine different plasmid profiles could be distinguished; six profiles were represented by one strain each. Of the 21 tetracycline-resistant strains, plasmids were found in 17 isolates (80%) carrying from 1-2 to 5 plasmids of various sizes. No plasmids were found in tetracycline-sensitive strains, with the exception of one isolate which contained a 24.4 MDa plasmid and was co-trimoxazole-resistant. Our studies indicate a relatively high percentage of tetracycline-resistant C. jejuni isolates in the Tel Aviv area. In 80% of these strains, various plasmid profiles were detected.
