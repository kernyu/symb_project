One hundred and fifty six strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, isolated from cases of pulmonary tuberculosis were subjected to sensitivity test to detect initial and acquired drug resistance to Streptomycin, isoniazid, Rifampicin, Ethambutol and Pyrazinamide. Initial and acquired drug resistance was observed to one or more drugs in 16% and 24.4% of the patients respectively. Strains resistant to Rifampicin and Ethambutol were resistant to Isoniazid also. Drug resistance was unrelated to age and sex of the patients.
