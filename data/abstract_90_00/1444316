Ramoplanin, a new lipoglycodepsipeptide antibiotic, was uniformly active against 65 strains of enterococci, including strains highly resistant to vancomycin, penicillin G, and gentamicin. MBCs were usually within a fourfold dilution of the MICs. In time-kill studies, ramoplanin alone demonstrated dose-dependent bactericidal activity against enterococcal strains that resisted killing by vancomycin or penicillin in combination with gentamicin.
