HIV-1 reverse transcriptase can catalyze the addition of either azidothymidine monophosphate (AZTMP) or thymidine monophosphate (dTMP) to a primer strand opposite template adenosine bases. The ratio of incorporation of AZTMP to dTMP as catalyzed by HIV-1 reverse transcriptase has been determined to be 0.4 using an RNA-DNA duplex substrate prepared from oligonucleotides with sequences taken from the HIV-1 genome sequence. Slight variations are found for the incorporation ratio of the two nucleotides on other substrates. Substrates containing more than one adenosine in the single-stranded part of the template allow for more chances to incorporate AZTMP and less full-length product. Variations in the intensity of bands on an autoradiograph of a DNA sequencing gel corresponding to different positions of incorporation of AZTMP suggest that not all template adenosine positions offer the same level of discrimination against incorporation of AZTMP. A reverse transcriptase containing a set of four mutations (D67N, K70R, T215Y, K219Q) known to cause resistance to AZT in cell culture assays has a ratio of incorporation that is 0.77 +/- 0.03 times the ratio for the wild-type reverse transcriptase opposite one specific template adenosine. In contrast, a hybrid mutant containing the same four mutations that cause resistance to AZT and an additional mutation, Y181C, which by itself causes resistance to the non-nucleoside inhibitor L-697,661 [Sardana et al. (1992), J. Biol. Chem. 267, 17526-17530], has a ratio of incorporation that is 1.34 +/- 0.01 times that of the wild-type, indicating that the hybrid mutant enzyme is more susceptible to inhibition by AZTTP than the wild-type reverse transcriptase.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
