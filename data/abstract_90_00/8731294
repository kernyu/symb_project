Production of low molecular weight antibiotic substances was detected among pathogenic Escherichia coli isolates from diarrhoeal children's feces during evaluation of a rotavirus vaccine in Caracas city. One of these products, microcin V627a, was partially purified and characterized. Microcin synthesis and immunity system appears not to be plasmid determined and the antibiotic was produced to a high level in minimal medium during the stationary phase. This microcin has many features in common with the mccA15 family.
