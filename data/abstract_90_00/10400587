Alkanes are oxidized in Acinetobacter sp. strain ADP1 by a three-component alkane monooxygenase, composed of alkane hydroxylase, rubredoxin, and rubredoxin reductase. rubA and rubB encode rubredoxin and a NAD(P)H-dependent rubredoxin reductase. We demonstrate here that single base pair substitutions in rubA or rubB lead to defects in alkane degradation, showing that both genes are essential for alkane utilization. Differences in the degradation capacity for hexadecane and dodecane in these mutants are discussed. Two genes, estB and oxyR, are located downstream of rubB, but are not necessary for alkane degradation. estB encodes a functional esterase. oxyR encodes a LysR-type transcriptional regulator, conferring resistance to hydrogen peroxide. rubA, rubB, estB, and oxyR constitute an operon, which is constitutively transcribed from a sigma70 promoter, and an estB-oxyR containing message is also transcribed from an internal promoter.
