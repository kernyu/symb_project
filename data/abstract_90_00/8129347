Nosocomial urinary tract infection (UTI) is an important cause of increased morbidity and mortality in hospitalised patients. The increasing use of broad spectrum antibiotics will result in changes in the microbiological and antibiotic sensitivity pattern of pathogens isolated from nosocomial UTI. We have endeavoured to study the bacteriological pattern of nosocomial UTI and the antibiotic sensitivity patterns of the pathogens concerned. Over a period of one year, a total of 541 patients with 656 episodes of nosocomial UTI were studied. A total of 748 organisms were isolated. The two main complicating factors in nosocomial UTI were urogenital instrumentation (70.4%) and diabetes mellitus (24.2%). Klebsiella species (spp) was the predominant organism isolated (25.0%) and was significantly associated with age and diabetes mellitus. Klebsiella spp in nosocomial UTI showed an overall increase in resistance to antibiotics and multiple antibiotic resistant strains were not uncommon. Escherichia coli was isolated in 17.7% of cases. Streptococcus faecalis was isolated in 10.6% of cases and was significantly associated with instrumentation. Pseudomonas spp was isolated in 8.6% of cases and was generally sensitive to ceftazidime and amikacin. It was associated with systemic malignancies and the use of immunosuppressants.
