Prostatitis due to vancomycin-resistant enterococci has not been previously described. Reported here is a case of chronic prostatitis due to Enterococcus faecium, resistant to vancomycin, ampicillin, ciprofloxacin and doxycycline, in a 42-year-old liver transplant recipient. Treatment with a combination of rifampin and nitrofurantoin for 6 weeks resulted in long-lasting cure. Other antimicrobial agents active in vitro against vancomycin-resistant enterococci, such as quinupristin/ dalfopristin and chloramphenicol, are unlikely to achieve sufficient prostatic tissue levels to be successfully utilized for treatment of this condition.
