Three separate single-dose studies were performed to define the disposition and pharmacokinetics of daptomycin in healthy volunteers. Daptomycin was administered as a single 14C-labeled dose (1.0 mg/kg of body weight) and as single doses between 0.5 and 6.0 mg/kg. All doses were intravenous. Antibacterial activity was determined from doses of 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, and 6.0 mg/kg against two strains of Staphylococcus aureus (one methicillin resistant) and one Enterococcus strain. After administration of 14C-labeled daptomycin, recovery of 14C in urine and feces accounted for 83% of the administered dose, with the greatest fraction (78%) appearing in the urine. Specific analysis for daptomycin in both urine and plasma indicated that metabolic products were present in urine, but total 14C in plasma consisted of daptomycin only. Doses between 0.5 and 6 mg/kg were linear, with a limited total body clearance (0.13 to 0.21 ml/min/kg) and a small volume of distribution (0.10 to 0.15 liter/kg). The small volume of distribution may be a factor of the high plasma protein binding (90 to 95%). Renal clearance made up 34 to 54% of total body clearance. Daptomycin demonstrated in vivo antibacterial activity against all three test strains, with the greatest activity observed against methicillin-resistant S. aureus. The predicted MIC for all three strains was approximately 13 micrograms/ml, corresponding to total (bound plus unbound) drug. On the basis of the drug's pharmacokinetics and antibacterial activity, doses of 4 to 6 mg/kg/day, possibly in divided doses, are predicted to be effective.
