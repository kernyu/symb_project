OBJECTIVE: To analyse the causes of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) and to evaluate the effects of chemotherapy with ofloxacin and other antituberculosis drugs. METHOD: 27 cases with MDR-TB were treated with the regimen of 3KPTHOX/PTHOX. Changes of sputum convesion, X-ray manifestations and side effects after the treatment were also evaluated. RESULTS: 67% of the MDR-TB patients were due to irregular treatment, and 18% were caused by improper treatment. The sputum culture conversion rate at end of treatment was 89%. The bacteriological relapse rate of converted cases during 2 year follow-up was 8%. CONCLUSIONS: MDR-TB might be prevented by a combination of health education and rational use of short-course chemotherapy. Ofloxacin and other second-line anti-tuberculosis drugs are effective and were tolerated in treating patients with MDR-TB.
