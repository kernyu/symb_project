A series of cephalosporins bearing a 5,5-fused ring system, an (imidazo[5,1-b]thiazolium-6-yl)methyl group, at the C-3 position were synthesized and evaluated for in vitro antibacterial activities. CP6679 (1s) and its analogues showed potent antibacterial activities against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa. They were also highly active against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). CP6679 (1s) showed more potent antibacterial activity than ceftazidime (CAZ) or cefpirome (CPR) against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and MRSA.
