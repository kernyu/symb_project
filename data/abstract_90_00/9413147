A mouse leukemia L1210 cell line, denoted MQ-580, that was selected for resistance to the ribonucleotide reductase inhibitor, 4-methyl-5-amino-1-formylisoquinoline thiosemicarbazone (MAIQ), in addition to having altered properties at the ribonucleotide reductase site had other alterations that contributed to its resistant phenotype; these included the expression of p-glycoprotein and the multi-drug resistance associated protein (MRP). The efflux of rhodamine 123 (Rh-123) or daunomycin (Dau) was greatly increased in MQ-580 cells compared to parental wild-type (WT) cells. The effluxes of Rh-123 and Dau were ATP- and temperature-dependent. The p-glycoprotein inhibitors, verapamil, cyclosporin A and reserpine blocked the efflux of both Rh-123 and Dau. In contrast, the inhibitors of MRP, MK571, BSO-treatment, arsenite and genistein did not block the efflux of either Rh-123 or Dau from MQ-580 cells. These findings suggest that the p-glycoprotein is the major transporter involved in effluxing Rh-123 and Dau from MQ-580 cells.
