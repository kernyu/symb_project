In January 1983, a number of premature infants under management in the premature infants' unit of our hospital were found to have bacteremia due to Staphylococcus aureus. By the end of February of the same year, 4 of these infants, who had been treated in the same unit, developed impetigo. The S. aureus responsible for this condition was classified as type IV by a coagulase typing. In a subsequent antimicrobial susceptibility test using the disk diffusion method, this microorganism was found to be resistant to methicillin, erythromycin and lincomycin, and to be susceptible to tetracycline, chloramphenicol and cefmetazole, indicating that it was a methicillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA). Because the result from the coagulase typing agreed with the antimicrobial susceptibility pattern in all cases, we concluded that these cases represented nosocomial infection with MRSA. The source and route of the infection were investigated, and measures taken to prevent bacterial spread from carriers and to keep instruments and environments clean. Although the source of infection was not identified. Then, we tried wiping the body surface of the premature infants with an Isodine solution (10% PVP-I, 1:100 dilution) in order to prevent colonization of the microorganism on the body surface. With this application+, MRSA was no longer detected from the body surface of the premature infants, and no additional MRSA infection occurred in the premature infants' unit. Data collected for premature infants' managed at our hospital in the subsequent 6 years allows us to conclude that MRSA infection can be almost completely controlled by frequent surveys of carriers and appropriate body surface wiping with Isodine solution.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
