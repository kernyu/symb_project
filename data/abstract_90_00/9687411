The in vitro activities of seven quinolones and the sequences of the quinolone resistance-determining regions (QRDR) in the A and B subunits of DNA gyrase were determined for 14 mycobacterial species. On the basis of quinolone activity, quinolones were arranged from that with the greatest to that with the least activity as follows: sparfloxacin, levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, pefloxacin, flumequine, and nalidixic acid. Based on MICs, the species could be organized into three groups: resistant (Mycobacterium avium, M. intracellulare, M. marinum, M. chelonae, M. abscessus [ofloxacin MICs, >/=8 microg/ml]), moderately susceptible (M. tuberculosis, M. bovis BCG, M. kansasii, M. leprae, M. fortuitum third biovariant, M. smegmatis [ofloxacin MICs, 0.5 to 1 microg/ml]), and susceptible (M. fortuitum, M. peregrinum, M. aurum [ofloxacin MICs, </=0.25 microg/ml]). Peptide sequences of the QRDR of GyrB were identical in all the species, including the amino acids at the three positions known to be involved in acquired resistance to quinolone, i.e., 426 (Asp), 447 (Arg), and 464 (Asn) (numbering system used for Escherichia coli). The last two residues could be involved in the overall low level of susceptibility of mycobacteria to quinolones since they differ from those found in the very susceptible E. coli (Lys-447 and Ser-464) but are identical to those found in the less susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Peptide sequences of the QRDR of GyrA were identical in all the species, except for the amino acid at position 83, which was an alanine in the two less susceptible groups and a serine in the most susceptible one, as in E. coli, suggesting that this amino acid is involved in the observed differences of quinolone susceptibility within the Mycobacterium genus.
