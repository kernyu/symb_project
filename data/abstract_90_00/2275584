Antibiotic sensitivity of 3524 Shigella cultures isolated from patients in 1974-1982 and 414 cultures isolated in 1983-1985 was assayed with standard paper disks. The isolates of 1974-1982 were mostly responsive to ampicillin, carbenicillin, kanamycin, gentamicin, monomycin, neomycin and chloramphenicol. Certain differences in the level of the antibiotic resistance were observed in the Shigella isolates belonging to diverse species. Polyresistant cultures of Shigella amounted to 96.5% and ranged from 88.5 to 99.4% in different years. The number of the cultures with multiple resistance among Shigella sonnei was somewhat higher than that among the Flexneri and Newcastle bacilli. The Shigella isolates of 1983-1985 were mostly responsive to gentamicin, carbenicillin, neomycin, kanamycin and monomycin. 55.5% of the Shigella isolates were responsive to chloramphenicol and only 3.1% to tetracycline. Almost all the causative agents of dysentery isolated within that period were polyresistant. Phenotypic characteristics of multiple resistance in the Shigella cultures were studied.
