The World Health Organization Western Pacific Region Gonococcal Antimicrobial Surveillance Programme (WHO WPR GASP) is a multicentric long term programme of continuous surveillance of the antibiotic susceptibility of Neisseria gonorrhoeae. In 1997 the programme examined the susceptibility of 8,594 isolates of gonococci to various antimicrobials in 15 focal points. The trend toward increased antimicrobial resistance noted in earlier years continued. The proportion of quinolone resistant gonococci reported from most centres was either maintained or else increased. More than half of the isolates tested in China-Hong Kong, China, Japan, Korea, and the Philippines had altered quinolone susceptibility and increases in the number and percentage of quinolone resistant strains were noted in most, but not all, of the other centres. Resistance to the penicillins was again widespread, and chromosomally mediated resistance was a significant factor. Penicillinase-producing Niesseria gonorrhoeae (PPNG) were present in all centres. All isolates were sensitive to the third generation cephalosporins and only a very few isolates in China were spectinomycin resistant. High level tetracycline resistance was concentrated in a number of centres including Singapore, Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam. The proportion of tetracycline resistant Neiserria gonorrhoeae (TRNG) in most of the remaining centres was less than 10 per cent.
