We investigated human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 RNA, proviral DNA, and antiretroviral drug-resistant variants in cervicovaginal secretions of HIV-1-infected women receiving antiretroviral therapy. The prevalence of detectable HIV-1 RNA in genital secretions was inversely related to the number of antiretroviral drugs taken by the patients. Proviral DNA was detected in approximately half of all samples of cervicovaginal secretions from HIV-1-infected women, regardless of the presence or absence of HIV-1 RNA in cervicovaginal secretions and of the antiretroviral regimen. In cervicovaginal secretions of most women with persisting genital viral replication, HIV variants exhibiting mutations associated with drug resistance against protease and reverse-transcriptase pol genes were found. Our observations indicate that antiretroviral therapy is not effective in purging the female genital tract of cell-associated provirus and that antiretroviral drugs that penetrate the female genital tract at suboptimal concentrations exert a potent selective pressure on genital HIV variants when local replication of free HIV-1 RNA persists.
