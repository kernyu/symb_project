Fifty strains of Mycoplasma pneumoniae were tested for susceptibility to new quinolones, tetracyclines, and macrolides. Temafloxacin, ofloxacin, and ciprofloxacin possessed the most mycoplasmacidal activity against these organisms. The MBC for 50% of the strains (MBC50)-to-MIC50 ratio for each of these drugs was 4. The MBC50-to-MIC50 ratios for the tetracyclines and macrolides were markedly higher, within a range of 32 to 2,000. On the basis of these results, temafloxacin and ofloxacin might be promising antimicrobial agents for the treatment of mycoplasmal infection.
