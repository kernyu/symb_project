Cefozopran (CZOP) was administered intravenously to 22 infants (aged 3 months to 15 years) with infections excluding suppurative meningitis in doses of 10 to 40 mg/kg 3 to 4 times daily for periods of 3 to 16 days and its efficacy and safety in infantile infections as well as pharmacokinetic parameters were determined. The half-lives of CZOP after intravenous administration at doses of 10, 20 and 40 mg/kg were 2.84, 2.36 +/- 0.67, and 2.48 hours, respectively. The rates of recovery in the urine within 6 hours of administration were 83.6%, 62.9 +/- 23.1%, and 77.3%, respectively. The subjects for whom drug responses were evaluable consisted of 1 case of suppurative meningitis, 8 cases of respiratory tract infection, 2 cases of urinary tract infection, 2 cases of oral infection, 2 cases of pharyngotonsillitis, 1 case of skin soft tissue infection, and 1 case of external otitis, totaling 17 cases. The efficacy rate was 88.2%. The drug proved so effective on suppurative meningitis in particular that the patient was healed without leaving any sequela behind. Seven strains were identified as causative pathogens (5 strains of Haemophilus influenzae, 1 strain of Staphylococcus aureus, 1 strain of group B Streptococcus) isolated from 6 patients. All but 1 strain were eradicated (the rate of eradication 83.3%). In the patients with suppurative meningitis the bacterial count of spinal fluid was markedly decreased 6 hours after drug administration and the organism was eradicated in 45 hours. Eruption was noted in 1 patient as a side effect of CZOP, but disappeared soon after discontinuation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
