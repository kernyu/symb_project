Compared to nalidixic acid, the new quinolones possess an enlarged antimicrobial spectrum, greatly enhanced bactericidal activity, and substantial pharmacokinetic advantages. Because their activity against streptococci is limited the quinolones presently available will never be included in routine regimens for children. Moreover, adequate pharmacokinetic studies are still lacking in pediatrics, and potential drug toxicity warrants further long-term monitoring. Nevertheless, various studies strongly suggest that there is no quinolone-induced cartilage toxicity in humans, and the results of published clinical trials with fluoroquinolones in pediatric patients show promising efficacy and safety. From a review of the available data it is concluded that use of the quinolones in children should be limited to specific infections which are usually caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus or Staphylococcus epidermidis, and are complicated by underlying pathologic or special conditions such as cystic fibrosis or urologic abnormality. In each case, careful monitoring to determine efficacy, potential adverse effects including drug-drug interaction and toxicity, and any emergence of bacterial resistance is mandatory.
