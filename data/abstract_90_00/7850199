In a study involving 1996 isolates from approximately 143 hospitals in 27 countries, the incidence of multiple mechanisms of resistance to aminoglycosides in Pseudomonas species was much higher than in previous studies. The two most common single mechanisms of resistance [permeability and aminoglycoside acetyltransferase (6')-II] were also most commonly involved in multiple mechanisms. This incredible heterogeneity of mechanisms suggests continued and diverse selection pressures.
