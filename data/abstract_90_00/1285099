Pneumococcal pneumonia and meningitis remain common infections with significant morbidity and mortality. For many years, penicillins or cephalosporins, erythromycin and chloramphenicol have been the mainstay of chemotherapy for these and other pneumococcal infections. Resistance to these antimicrobial agents has increased worldwide and resistant pneumococci are now isolated with increasing frequency in the United Kingdom. This article reviews the results of antimicrobial susceptibility and serotyping studies carried out over the last five years on UK isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae referred to the Streptococcus and Antibiotic Reference Laboratories of the Division of Hospital Infection for serotyping or confirmation of antibiotic resistance. During this period there has been a marked increase in the referral of pneumococcal isolates resistant to one or more of the antimicrobials commonly used for treatment. The implications for antimicrobial therapy and vaccination policy are discussed.
