Information about genetic changes during the selection process could indicate mechanisms underlying the spread of resistance to anthelmintic drugs. For clarification of the role of the Mpi locus encoding mannose-phosphate isomerase enzyme in determining resistance, genotyping of Oesophagostomum dentatum strains was performed using an isoelectrofocusing technique. In levamisole- and pyrantel-selected strains the allele associated with resistance has probably been found. Significant values for genetic differentiation between treated and untreated strains of common origin were recorded by F(st) indices (theta = 0.078; P = 0.0008). The specific genomic makeup of a flubendazole-resistant strain, which did not correlate with that of the remaining isolates, might be ascribed to a different action of the anthelmintic or different environmental conditions under which resistance against this drug arose. The absence of heterozygotes in male populations indicated an XX/X0 system of sex determination for the Mpi locus, thus providing a greater potential for the development of resistance. A possible involvement of alleles linked with mannose-phosphate isomerase in alterations of membrane receptors that can be associated with resistance against imidothiazole-based drugs is discussed.
