The emergence of chloroquine resistance in Plasmodium falciparum has necessitated the development of alternate strategies for chemotherapy and chemoprophylaxis. One approach has been the identification of drugs that do not possess any intrinsic antimalarial activity when used alone but that potentiate the effect of currently available antimalarial drugs, such as chloroquine. We identified fluoxetine hydrochloride (Prozac), a commonly prescribed antidepressant, as another resistance modulator for drug-resistant P. falciparum. Studies with chloroquine-resistant clones and isolates from various geographical locations confirmed our initial observations with a chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum clone, W2. Fluoxetine concentrations of 500 nM were found to effectively modulate chloroquine resistance by 66% in clone W2. In comparison, verapamil at similar concentrations was observed to modulate chloroquine resistance in clone W2 by 61%. Neither fluoxetine nor verapamil was observed to possess any innate antimalarial activity. These data augment the current description of the chloroquine resistance phenotype and may provide additional insights into lead-directed synthesis of new antimalarial drugs.
