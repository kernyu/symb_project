The structure of a 1.6-kb SphI-HindIII DNA sequence necessary and sufficient for the replication of a 8.6-kb plasmid pLS11 of Bacillus subtilis IFO 3022, which is responsible for gamma-polyglutamate production, has been characterized by using a trimethoprim (Tmp)-resistance gene derived form B. subtilis TTK24 chromosomal DNA as a selective marker. The 1.6-kb DNA sequence contains a rep gene encoding the protein (333 amino acids) essential for initiation of replication and a possible origin of replication. The predicted REP protein of pLS11 has an overall homology with the REP proteins of pUH1 (74.8% identity), pBAA1 (92.8%), and pFTB14 (78.7%) in Bacillus spp., pLP1 (42.1%) and pLAB1000 (36.3%) in Lactobacillus spp., and pUB110 (35.3%) and pC194 (37.4%) in Staphylococcus aureus, but has not any similarity with the REP protein of the staphylococcal plasmid pT181.
