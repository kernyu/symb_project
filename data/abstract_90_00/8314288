Perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis has proven to prevent infections in a variety of surgical interventions such as colorectal, biliary and vascular surgery. The antimicrobial spectrum of an antibiotic used for perioperative prophylaxis should include Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus spp. and Escherichia coli which are among the most frequent pathogens isolated from surgical infections. Second generation cephalosporins provide appropriate activity against these microorganisms. In colorectal surgery, combination with an anti-anaerobic agent is mandatory. During the past few years no major resistance development has been observed against second generation cephalosporins which are used at a dosage of 1.5 to 2 g. A single dose may provide sufficient serum levels for approximately three hours. Prolonged surgical procedures need an additional dose. Single dose prophylaxis with a second generation cephalosporin appears to be an appropriate strategy for infection prevention in surgery with regard to efficiency, safety and costs.
