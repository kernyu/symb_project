The minimal metabolism-inhibiting concentrations (MMC) of 11 antibiotics were determined for 40 strains each of M. hominis and U. urealyticum using a terminal color change broth method. All strains were recovered in 1990. Resistance to tetracycline (MMC greater than 8 mg/l) was found for 12.5% of strains of M. hominis and U. urealyticum, as compared with 5% in 1985. Rokitamycin was the most active macrolide against M. hominis (MMC 90: 0.06 mg/l). U. urealyticum strains were susceptible to all the macrolides tested, with the greatest activities being seen for rokitamycin and clarithromycin (MMC 90: 0.06 mg/l and 0.12 mg/l respectively). Sparfloxacin was the most active quinolone against both species. Human clinical trials designed to evaluate these new molecules for the treatment of mycoplasmal and ureaplasmal genital infections are warranted.
