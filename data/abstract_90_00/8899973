255 Acinetobacter strains, from clinical specimens of inpatients and outpatients, were identified phenotypically according to the new taxonomy proposed by Bouvet and Grimont. A. baumannii was the most frequent species (80.8%). This species underwent biotyping and serotyping according to the scheme of Bouvet and Grimont, and that of Traub, respectively, 81.2% of samples belonged to biotypes 2, 6 and 9 with a predominance of biotype 2. 86.6% of the strains could be serotyped; 2 new serotypes were encountered. The new serotype 29, being the most frequently isolated, was related to biotype 2 (86.6%), whereas serotype 13 was related to biotype 6 (84.8%). These clones presented marked multiple resistance patterns and were widespread in different wards. No outbreak was reported during the period studied. These phenotypical methods proved to be useful in differentiating strains of A. baumannii and, if used together, they showed a high discriminatory power.
