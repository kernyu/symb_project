In France a survey of the use of antimicrobials in veterinary medicine was set up in connection with the Committee for the Marketing Authorization of Veterinary Medicinal Products. This survey has emphasized the importance of antimicrobials in veterinary medicine and the reality of antibiotic resistance in both man and animals. Certain epidemiological data tend to demonstrate that the use of antibiotics in animals increases the risk of antibiotic resistance in man, through selection in animals of resistant pathogenic bacteria or of a non-pathogenic resistant bacteria carrying resistance plasmids. Four proposals are put forward for the control of these different risks: reserve certain antibiotics (life-saving antibiotics) for human medicine, conform to a code of good practices for antibiotic use in animals, strengthen and connect up existing networks for the epidemiosurveillance of antibiotic resistance, provide for studies on the ecological impact of antibiotics in the registration dossiers for veterinary medicinal products. These evolutive measures, based on scientific progress in microbiology, epidemiology and clinical studies should respond satisfactorily to the expectations of all concerned.
