The rpoB gene encodes the beta subunit of the DNA-dependent RNA polymerase of bacteria. Mutations in defined areas result in resistance to rifampin. Mycobacterium smegmatis is naturally resistant to rifampin, but analysis of the rpoB gene revealed no identifiable rifampin resistance mutations. Another mechanism of resistance may be present.
