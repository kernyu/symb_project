In order to study the possible phenotypic and genotypic changes related to glycopeptide pressure on enterococci, a study was undertaken using stepwise in vitro exposure to achieve the following objectives: (i) to evaluate the development of resistance and cross-resistance between vancomycin and teicoplanin; (ii) to determine the stability of the acquired level of resistance; (iii) to determine the phenotypic and genotypic changes related to glycopeptide pressure; and (iv) to assess the spectrum of antibiotic-susceptibility of all strains. Our results showed that no variants resistant to glycopeptides could be selected after in vitro glycopeptide exposure experiments. However some strains showed increased MIC values: 8 mg/l to vancomycin in eight strains selected by vancomycin itself, while teicoplanin produced intermediate values to vancomycin in only three strains. The phenotypes were stable in vitro after numerous passages in antibiotic-free medium and three out of nine strains with a changed MIC level, showed 40, 42 and 43 kDa proteins in cell membrane preparations. The profile of antibiotic resistance was comparable in all isogenic strains tested with the exception of three selected strains that became susceptible to penicillin G. The pressure produced by glycopeptides, particularly vancomycin has contributed to an increased level of MIC that can influence the acquisition and/or full expression of this resistance.
