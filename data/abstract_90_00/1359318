Plasmodium falciparum malaria in Thailand is highly resistant to available antimalarials, and alternative drugs are needed urgently. Artemether is effective against falciparum malaria but associated with a high recrudescence rate. The proper dosage regimen remains to be defined. We have done a clinical trial comparing mefloquine 1250 mg in divided doses with oral artemether at 700 mg total dose given over 5 days in acute uncomplicated falciparum malaria. 46 patients, admitted to the Bangkok Hospital for Tropical Diseases, were randomised to receive either mefloquine (12) or artemether (34). Hospital follow-up was 28 days for the artemether group and 42 days for the mefloquine group. Oral artemether gave a significantly faster parasite clearance time than mefloquine (30 vs 64 h), and a significantly better cure rate (97 vs 64%) with fewer episodes of dizziness and vomiting. Oral artemether at 700 mg given over 5 days is effective and well tolerated. The cure rate with this regimen is higher than that reported by previous studies with 600 mg intramuscular artemether given over 5 days. Oral artemether can be considered as an alternative drug for multiple-drug-resistant falciparum malaria.
