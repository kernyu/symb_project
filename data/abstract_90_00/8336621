More than half the world's population lives in areas where there is a potential risk of malaria. Programs for controlling malaria in cities and other areas of developing countries have broken down for many reasons, including the cost of vector control, resistance of mosquitoes to readily available insecticides such as DDT, and the emergence of parasites that are resistant to cheap, safe antimalarial drugs. Wars, political instability and population migration have increased the difficulty of implementing control programs. The increase in travel to malaria endemic areas and the changing pattern of sensitivity to antimalarial drugs make it imperative for physicians to keep up to date with recommendations for malaria chemoprophylaxis. This article reviews the available drugs and compares the prophylactic regimens recommended by various authorities.
