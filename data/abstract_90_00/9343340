Changes that occur in the local draining lymph nodes including, changes in cell surface markers and cytokine gene expression were studied over the first 4 weeks of a primary, Ostertagia ostertagi infection of the abomasum. Cells recovered from the abomasal lymph nodes (ABLN) after infection showed a decrease in the percentage of CD3+ cells, and an increase in the percentage of IgM+ cells and cells bearing the TcR1 marker. These changes were coincident with an increase in the proportion of activated cells (II-2R). Analysis of mitogen-stimulated ABLN cells by RNase protection assay (RPA) showed a dramatic reduction in IL-2 and IFN-gamma transcription after infection. In addition, analysis of unstimulated ABLN cells by competitive RT-PCR showed a similar decrease in demonstrable levels of IL-2 mRNA, but IL-10, IL-4 and IFN-gamma mRNA levels were elevated.
