Since 1984, when the first fluoroquinolone, norfloxacin, was marketed in Europe, there has been a marked increase in the usage of this class of drugs. In order to evaluate the influence of this drug usage on the prevalence of resistance to fluoroquinolones in clinical isolates of the family Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci and Enterococcus faecalis we reviewed the susceptibility data from four collaborative surveys conducted between 1983 and 1990 by the Study Group 'Bacterial Resistance' of the Paul-Ehrlich-Society for Chemotherapy. All participating laboratories used the same standardized methods. Minimal inhibitory concentrations were determined by the broth microdilution method. More than 20,000 bacterial strains were tested. The results are presented for ciprofloxacin, which is regarded as the representative of the fluoroquinolones. Using > or = 4 mg/l as a breakpoint for resistance to ciprofloxacin, the prevalence of resistant strains of the family Enterobacteriaceae in Central Europe between 1983 and 1990 remained below 1%. In contrast, the resistance rates in P. aeruginosa were 0.7%, 1.0%, 3.8% and 7.0%, in S. aureus 0%, 0.5%, 6.6% and 6.8%, and in E. faecalis 2.2%, 0.7%, 4.9% and 7.7% in 1983, 1986, 1989 and 1990, respectively. The latest study carried out in cooperation with 78 laboratories from 12 European countries revealed great differences in the prevalence of resistance to fluoroquinolones from one species to another ranging from 0% with Proteus vulgaris and Salmonella spp. to 26.7% with Providencia stuartii.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
