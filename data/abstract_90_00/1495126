Multidrug resistant typhoid fever (MDRT) is becoming an alarming public health problem in and around Pondicherry, South India. A retrospective review of the multidrug resistant typhoid fever cases admitted to the paediatrics ward of JIPMER Hospital, Pondicherry (India) during 1990 is presented. Prolonged pyrexia, chills and rigors, toxaemia, and tender hepatomegaly often more than 3 cm below the costal margin (often without splenomegaly) were striking features of MDRT cases. The incidence of complications was also greater. Positive blood cultures were observed even after weeks of antibiotic therapy, indicating persistent bacteraemia; resistance was almost always observed for multiple drugs (two or more). The fluoroquinolone group of drugs such as ciprofloxacin have been found to be the best for MDRT in terms of rapid response and cost effectiveness. Cefotaxime has moderate efficacy.
