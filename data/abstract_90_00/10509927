Resistance to carbapenem antibiotics in gram-negative bacteria is due, in part, to expression of a wide spectrum metallo-beta-lactamase, which renders the drug inactive. Biphenyl tetrazoles containing 3-n-butyl-1-phenylpyrazole-5-carboxylates or the corresponding 5-ethyl esters were found to inhibit metallo-beta-lactamases as well as renal dehydropeptidase I to a lesser extent.
