The objectives of the study were to examine the clinical significance of cytomegalovirus (CMV) culture results and drug susceptibilities in CMV isolates from patients with AIDS-related CMV retinitis. Blood and urine for CMV culture were obtained from 207 patients with newly diagnosed CMV retinitis who were enrolled in a randomized trial comparing foscarnet and ganciclovir. Culture-positive rates at baseline were 45% and 71% for blood and urine, respectively. Rates decreased 3- to 10-fold after initiation of either treatment. Mortality was related to both positive baseline blood and urine cultures; adjusted relative risks were 1.97 and 2.03, respectively. Positive blood cultures at baseline were associated with more rapid retinitis progression. Drug-resistant CMV was found, over comparable follow-up periods on assigned treatment, in 4 of 8 ganciclovir-assigned patients with persistent viremia and 0 of 5 foscarnet-assigned patients with persistent viremia. Results of virologic assays of blood appear to be associated with clinical outcome of CMV retinitis.
