Experiments on white rats proved that the silicotic pulmonary changes slowed with the tails periodically immersed into iodine solution. Those pulmonary changes were due to inhalation of quartzite dust and especially due to intratracheal administration of standardized quartz dust DQ12. Influenced by inhalation of dust containing quartz, the rats demonstrated characteristic alterations in cytologic features of bronchial and alveolar lavage water. The "iodine baths" also declined those alterations, that may prove higher resistance of pulmonary macrophages to cytotoxic effects of quartz. This hypothesis finds a support in experiments with culture of rat peritoneal macrophages. If incubated in a medium with low iodine concentrations and subsequently washed off, the macrophages demonstrate lower incidence of cytotoxic effects due to the next incubation with particles of DQ12. The macrophage's higher resistance against cytotoxic agents is believed to result directly in antisilicotic effect of iodine, so "iodine baths" could be recommended for pathogenetic therapy and medical prophylaxis of silicosis.
