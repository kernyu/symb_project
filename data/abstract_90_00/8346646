The need for improved parasite control strategies to conserve anthelmintic efficacy and to avoid drug-related problems are addressed. Recent surveys have revealed a trend for sole dependence on ivermectin by livestock owners in the USA, with little regard for epidemiologic-based strategies, or the annual rotation of unrelated anthelmintic groups. Innovative parasite control strategies for cattle, sheep, and horses in northern USA are presented. The importance of closer monitoring and more rational use of anthelmintics is stressed.
