The MICs of erythromycin, azithromycin and ciprofloxacin were determined for 60 human fecal isolates of Campylobacter. Of these, 30 strains selected on the basis of their resistance to erythromycin by disk diffusion were highly resistant to both erythromycin and azithromycin. Nine of these selected isolates were resistant to ciprofloxacin. The remaining 30 strains were non-selected, consecutive isolates of Campylobacter susceptible to erythromycin by disk diffusion and were shown to be two- to five-fold more susceptible to azithromycin than to erythromycin as determined by MIC testing.
