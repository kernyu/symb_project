A newly developed broad-spectrum fluoroquinolone, levofloxacin (LVFX, DR-3355), was evaluated in vitro and in vivo in comparison with ciprofloxacin (CPFX), ofloxacin (OFLX) and norfloxacin (NFLX). The results were as follows. 1. Antimicrobial activity Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) against 480 clinical isolates including 16 different species were determined using the microbroth dilution method. LVFX showed excellent antimicrobial activities against Gram-positive and -negative bacteria. The MIC values of LVFX for Gram-positive bacteria were superior to those of the other quinolones tested. The MIC values of LVFX for Gram-negative bacteria were comparable to those of CPFX and superior to those of OFLX and NFLX. 2. LVFX concentrations in serum and sputum LVFX was orally administered in a single dose of 200 mg to 2 patients with chronic lower respiratory tract infections, and its concentrations in serum and sputum were measured at intervals using bioassay. The peak concentrations of LVFX in serum were 1.52 and 1.24 micrograms/ml, and 84-95% of serum level were detected in sputum. From these data, it appeared that LVFX penetrate well into the lung. 3. Clinical efficacy and adverse reactions Fifteen patients with respiratory tract infections were treated with LVFX, and the overall efficacy rate was 78.6% (excellent in 3 cases, good in 8, fair in 3, poor in 0). As adverse reactions, anorexia was observed in 2 cases, diarrhea in 1 case and tremor of finger in 1 case. Although an elevation of total bilirubin in serum was observed in a case as an abnormal laboratory finding, it was mild, transient and improved rapidly after the completion of LVFX treatment.
