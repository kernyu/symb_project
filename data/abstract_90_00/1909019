We report the first isolation in France of a penicillinase-non producing Neisseria gonorrhoeae with high level tetracycline resistance. The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of nine antibiotics were determined by agar dilution for the tetracycline resistant strain and 39 other penicillinase-non producing N. gonorrhoeae strains which were isolated during the same year (1989), in Toulouse. No difference was observed between the MICs except for the tetracycline (tetracycline-resistant strain MIC = 32 mg/l). The commonly used antibiotics other than tetracycline were active in vitro against all the strains. The plasmid content of the tetracycline-resistant strain was analysed by agarose gel electrophoresis and revealed the presence of two plasmids: the 2.6-megadalton in cryptic plasmid and the 25.2-megadalton Tet M conjugative plasmid.
