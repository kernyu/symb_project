MxA is a GTPase that accumulates to high levels in the cytoplasm of interferon-treated human cells. Expression of MxA cDNA confers to transfected cell lines a high degree of resistance against several RNA viruses, including influenza, measles, vesicular stomatitis, and Thogoto viruses. We have now generated transgenic mice that express MxA cDNA in the brain and other organs under the control of a constitutive promoter. Embryonic fibroblasts derived from the transgenic mice were nonpermissive for Thogoto virus and showed reduced susceptibility for influenza A and vesicular stomatitis viruses. The transgenic animals survived challenges with high doses of Thogoto virus by the intracerebral or intraperitoneal route. Furthermore, the transgenic mice were more resistant than their nontransgenic littermates to intracerebral infections with influenza A and vesicular stomatitis viruses. These results demonstrate that MxA is a powerful antiviral agent in vivo, indicating that it may protect humans from the deleterious effects of infections with certain viral pathogens.
