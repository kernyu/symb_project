1. Development of the pacemaker system in the small intestine depends upon signalling via tyrosine kinase (Kit) receptors. The downstream pathways initiated by Kit in interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC) have not been investigated. Wortmannin and 2-(4-morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one (LY 294002), inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase (PI3-kinase), were used to test the involvement of this pathway in the development and maintenance of ICC and electrical rhythmicity in the murine small intestine. 2. ICC and electrical slow waves were present in the murine jejunum at birth. ICC and electrical rhythmicity continued to develop in neonates such that adult activity was recorded after 1 week. Development of ICC and rhythmicity were maintained in organ culture. 3. Wortmannin or LY 294002 inhibited the development of slow waves and blocked rhythmicity within 2-4 days. Loss of slow waves was preceded by disappearance of Kit-positive cells from the myenteric (IC-MY) and deep muscular plexus (IC-DMP) regions. Wortmannin or LY 294002 had no acute effect on slow waves. 4. Muscles from older animals (day 10-day 30) developed resistance to wortmannin treatment, but when the exposure to wortmannin was increased to 35 days, damage to ICC networks and electrical dysrhythmias were observed. 5. PI3-kinase appears to be a critical downstream signalling element linking Kit receptors to ICC development and maintenance of phenotype. ICC are more sensitive to Kit or PI3-kinase blockade at birth, but the importance of the PI3-kinase signalling in the maintenance of ICC persists into adulthood. Interference with PI3-kinase signalling in immature or adult animals could result in disruption of ICC and gastrointestinal dysrhythmias.
