BACKGROUND: This study determines the efficacy and safety of a 1-week triple therapy regimen of lansoprazole, clarithromycin and metronidazole in an area with a high prevalence of pre-treatment metronidazole-resistant strains of Helicobacter pylori. METHODS: Seventy-five H. pylori positive patients with gastritis or duodenal ulcer were entered into an open study of lansoprazole 30 mg o.m., clarithromycin 250 mg b.d. and metronidazole 400 mg b.d. H. pylori status was determined by CLOtest, histology, culture and by 13C-urea breath test (repeated > or = 28 days after treatment). RESULTS: Seventy-one patients completed the treatment and returned for follow-up. H. pylori was eradicated in 61 of 71 (86%) patients by per-protocol analysis, and in 61 of 75 (81%) patients by intention-to-treat analysis. H. pylori was eradicated in 12 of 16 (75%) patients with metronidazole-resistant strains compared with 22 of 24 (92%) in patients with metronidazole-sensitive strains of H. pylori (P = 0.14). Fourty-five patients reported at least one adverse event, and three patients stopped treatment due to them (two with headaches and one with diarrhoea). CONCLUSIONS: A 1-week course of lansoprazole 30 mg o.m., clarithromycin 250 mg b.d. and metronidazole 400 mg b.d. eradicates H. pylori in up to 86% of patients. It is of proven benefit in patients with pre-treatment metronidazole-resistant strains of H. pylori.
