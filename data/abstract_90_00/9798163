Acid anionic sanitizers for treatment of fruits and vegetables were prepared using ingredients generally recognized as safe by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration or anionic surfactants and organic acid food additives. They met the regulatory definition as sanitizers by showing bactericidal efficacy of 99.999% in 30 s against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538 and Escherichia coli ATCC 11229. These sanitizers showed a broad spectrum of microbicidal activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Antibiotic-sensitive and resistant strains of Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella typhimurium were equally susceptible to these sanitizers. The acid anionic sanitizers showed microbicidal efficacy equal to that of hypochlorite against Aeromonas hydrophila, E. coli O157:H7, L. monocytogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, S. typhimurium, and S. aureus. Unlike most other sanitizers, these agents do not covalently react with organic components of food; unlike cationic agents, they do not leave residues. The acid anionic sanitizers are prepared using stable, biodegradable, and nontoxic ingredients. Rapid microbicidal activity and the ease of storage, transportation, and use make these sanitizers an attractive alternative to hypochlorite for sanitizing fruits and vegetables.
