Since the initial report of resistance of Plasmodium falciparum to chloroquine in 1960 in the Thai-Cambodian border resistance to alternative drugs occurred early after their introduction. This development is considered to be the result of population migration and excessive drug pressure along with the presence of a multi-resistance gene within the parasite population. Multi-resistant strains as such have been disseminated throughout the country by returning migrant populations.
