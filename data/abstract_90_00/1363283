Sequential evaluation of P-glycoprotein expression was performed in 29 patients with acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia using immunocytochemistry with the C219 antibody. At diagnosis, 32% of the patients exhibited more than 5% of the P-gp(+) leukemic cells. Under chemotherapy, 62% of the patients eventually expressed a subset of P-gp positive leukemic cells. After conventional doses of cytosine-arabinoside (Ara-C) and daunorubicin or mitoxantrone, positive P-gp cells were noted in 65% of the cases. This percentage was significantly higher (p = 0.002) than the proportion of positive cases (15%) observed after regimens containing either intermediate doses of Ara-C or cyclosporine A, a P-gp modulator.
