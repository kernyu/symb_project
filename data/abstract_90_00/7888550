Streptomycin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic that is indicated for the treatment of tuberculous and nontuberculous infections. Intramuscular injection is the recommended route of administration. There are few reports on intravenous administration of streptomycin. We describe the use of intravenous streptomycin to treat endocarditis due to a strain of Enterococcus faecalis with high-level resistance to gentamicin. Physicians should consider the intravenous route as an alternate method of administering streptomycin.
