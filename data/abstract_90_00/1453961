A methodology was developed to construct any desired chromosomal mutation in the gene cluster that encodes the actinorhodin polyketide synthase (PKS) of Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2). A positive selection marker (resistance gene) is first introduced by double crossing-over into the chromosomal site of interest by use of an unstable delivery plasmid. This marker is subsequently replaced by the desired mutant allele via a second high-frequency double recombination event. The technology has been used to: (i) explore the significance of translational coupling between two adjacent PKS genes; (ii) prove that the acyl carrier protein (ACP) encoded by a gene in the cluster is necessary for the function of the actinorhodin PKS; (iii) provide genetic evidence supporting the hypothesis that serine 42 is the site of phosphopantetheinylation in the ACP of the actinorhodin PKS; and (iv) demonstrate that this ACP can be replaced by a Saccharopolyspora fatty acid synthase ACP to generate an active hybrid PKS.
