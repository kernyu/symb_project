The activities of nine antimicrobial agents against 247 isolates of group B, C, F, and G streptococci and viridans group streptococci were studied by the broth microdilution method. Erythromycin resistance was found in 29.7, 41.7, 81.8, 23.5, and 53.3% of the strains of group B, C, F, and G streptococci and viridans group streptococci tested, respectively. Macrolides are not considered an optimal alternative to penicillin in the treatment of streptococcal infections, at least empirically, in Taiwan.
