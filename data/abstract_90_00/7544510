Stable mutant cells Cebr-1 and Cebr-2, resistant to ethidium bromide (EB) in concentration of 2 micrograms/ml, have been isolated by a multistep selection in Chinese hamster ovary cells. It was shown that Cebr-1 and Cebr-2 cells acquired a cross-resistance to unrelated drugs. Stable changes in the structure of chromosomes 1, 2, 5 and 8 were revealed by karyological analysis. Overexpression and amplification of mdr genes were detected in Cebr-2 cells using Northern RNA and Southern DNA blot hybridization. Two independent hybrids Hybr-1 and Hybr-2 were obtained by fusion of Cebr-2 cells with Chinese hamster lung V-79 RJK cells, sensitive to EB. Hybr-2 cells were characterized by the same level of EB-resistance as Cebr-2 cells. Hybr-1 cells have a lower level of EB-resistance than Cebr-2 cells. Hybr-2 cells have demonstrated amplification and overexpression of mdr gene, the same as in Cebr-2 cells, whereas in Hybr-1 cells no mdr gene amplification was observed, but the level of mdr gene expression was higher than in sensitive cells. The data suggest that resistance of Chinese hamster cells to EB is mediated by amplification and overexpression of mdr genes.
