When grown on permeable supports, the T84 human colonic epithelial cell line forms polarized monolayer cultures with high-resistance tight junctions between adjacent cells. Addition of either insulin-like growth factor (IGF) I or II to the basolateral but not the apical membrane side of established monolayers caused a dose-dependent decrease in transepithelial resistance over a 4-day period. IGF-I was more potent than IGF-II, with half-maximally effective concentrations of 0.7 and 2.2 nM, respectively. Both IGF-I and -II caused a parallel increase in the transepithelial flux rates for Na+ and the extracellular space marker, mannitol, demonstrating that the decrease in electrical resistance was due to increased permeability through the tight junction-regulated paracellular pathway. Simultaneous addition of cycloheximide prevented the decline in electrical resistance, implying that protein synthesis is necessary for the effect of IGF on paracellular permeability. Treatment of monolayers with IGF produced a subtle condensation of the perijunctional actin ring as visualized using rhodamine-labeled phalloidin. These results demonstrate that IGF-I and -II regulate the paracellular permeability of T84 cell monolayers through a receptor-mediated process that probably involves changes in protein synthesis and cytoskeletal structure.
