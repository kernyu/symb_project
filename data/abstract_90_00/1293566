Effect of Na2EDTA and doxycycline applied alone and in combination in the treatment of experimentally induced dermatitis in rabbits with Staphylococcus aureus resistant to tetracyclines was studied. The rabbits were divided into three groups. The animals of group I were treated locally with the ointment containing 1% doxycycline or 1% Na2EDTA. In group II topical treatment was applied by means of injections of Na2EDTA solution in doses of 12.5 and 6.25 mg Na2EDTA per 1 kg/body weight. Group III was also treated locally with Na2EDTA solution like in group II, but additionally doxycycline in a dose of 50 micrograms per 1 kg/body weight was given i.v. Favourable therapeutic results were observed in the case of local, simultaneous application of Na2EDTA and doxycycline, or local application of Na2EDTA, and intravenous administration of doxycycline. However, the best therapeutic effect was seen in the case of local, simultaneous application of the ointment containing Na2EDTA and doxycycline.
