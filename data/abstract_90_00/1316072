The antimicrobial activity and spectrum of lomefloxacin were assessed by standardized disk diffusion methods in 36 countries. More than 500,000 facultative organisms were tested during the first 30 months of a 3-year monitoring interval. Lomefloxacin demonstrated inhibition (zones greater than or equal to 19 mm) of greater than 90% of Enterobacteriaceae, greater than 99% of Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, greater than 98% of Haemophilus spp., and 91% of Staphylococcus aureus strains. Pseudomonas spp., especially Pseudomonas aeruginosa (18% resistance), were considered moderately susceptible, as were most strains of streptococci and enterococci. Some variation of national/regional fluoroquinolone resistance rates was observed, using lomefloxacin as an index or indicator drug, with the highest numbers of resistant strains being isolated in France. However, these data demonstrated a wide spectrum of lomefloxacin activity in all nations monitored.
