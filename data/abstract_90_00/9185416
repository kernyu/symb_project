The use of antimicrobial drugs in Japan is remarkably high. In 1994, the total production cost of antimicrobial drugs amounted to 3.38 billion US dollars. The intensive use of broad-spectrum drugs, especially for treatment of increasing number of immunocompromised and elderly patients, resulted in the emergence and spread of antimicrobial-resistant organisms in Japan. A bacteriological study in a chronic care centre shows a variety of bacterial pathogens with increased antimicrobial resistance such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Control measures of nosocomial infections with resistant organisms have been established and strengthened. This includes surveillance researches such as re-evaluation of disinfectants.
