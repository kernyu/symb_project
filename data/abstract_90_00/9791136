We cloned the MLSB resistance determinant by PCR from a clinical isolate of Enterococcus faecalis 373, which is induced more strongly by a 16-membered-ring macrolide, tylosin, than by erythromycin. To elucidate the molecular basis of resistance of E. faecalis 373, we analyzed the cloned gene, designated ermAMR, by site-directed mutagenesis and reporter gene assay. Our results showed that an arginine-to-cysteine change in the seventh codon of the putative leader peptide endowed tylosin with resistance inducibility and that TAAA duplication enabled the control region to express the downstream methylase gene at a drastically increased level.
