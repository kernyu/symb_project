A fibrin glue preparation has been obtained from pooled human plasma using a procedure which includes a solvent-detergent (SD) treatment to inactivate lipid-enveloped viruses. The SD treatment inactivated greater than or equal to 5.5 log10 of HIV in less than 45 min, and greater than or equal to 5 log10 and greater than or equal to 6.5 log10 of VSV and Sindbis virus, respectively, in less than 2 h. The product was found to contain high quantities of fibrinogen (116 +/- 2.49 g/l; n = 12), factor XIII (35 +/- 2.88 U/ml) and von Willebrand factor (23 +/- 1.9 U/ml ristocetin cofactor activity), and relatively low levels of fibronectin (5.9 +/- 0.51 g/l). Plasminogen, the precursor of plasmin, which may play a negative role by decreasing the resistance of the fibrin clot, was at only 0.03 g/l. Cellulose acetate electrophoresis showed 95% gamma-proteins and 5% alpha-2-beta proteins. Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions detected three main protein bands with apparent molecular weights of 65, 56 and 47 kilodaltons, probably corresponding to the alpha, beta, and gamma fibrinogen subunits. Other characteristics of the product included (1) high clottability of fibrinogen (over 85%); (2) absence of low molecular weight fibrin degradation products; (3) rapid solubilization at room temperature (less than 10 min); (4) high tensile strength (202 +/- 27 g/cm2 after 2 h of application), and (5) high elasticity of the fibrin clot. In addition, scanning electron microscopy revealed a highly organized structure showing tridimensional arrangement of the fibrin fibers. SD treated fibrin glue should efficiently replace autologous fibrinogen or cryoprecipitate preparations for surgical application.
