A clinico-bacteriologic examination comprised 103 patients with destructive forms of pulmonary tuberculosis who excreted the bacterial and L-forms of M. tuberculosis. Patients were divided into two groups depending on their social adaptation. Group I included 66 patients with asocial behaviour, group 11-37 patients whose way of life was normal. Patients of group I exhibited copious excretion of M. tuberculosis and L-forms with a high degree drug resistance and multiresistance of M. tuberculosis to antituberculous preparations. Patients of group I had progress of the tuberculosis process with fatal outcomes 4.2 times more frequently.
