OBJECTIVE: The mechanism that tetrandrine (Tet) reduces hypoxic pulmonary hypertension was investigated METHOD: 30 Wistar rats were divided into normal control group, pulmonary hypertension group and tetrandrine-treated group. Total calcium conteins and calmodulin activity in lung tissue were measured with atomic absorption spectrophotometry and phosphodiesterase method. RESULTS: The results showed that Tet could remarkably reduce the mean pulmonary artery pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance in rats with hypoxic pulmonary hypertension, the contents of calcium (62 +/- 10 umol.g-1) and calmodulin (20 +/- 4 ng.mg-1) in the lung were significantly lower in rats administrated with Tet than those (74 +/- 16 umol.g-1, 27 +/- 6 ng.mg-1) rats with hypoxic pulmonary hypertension, and the contents of calcium were related with the mean pulmonary artery pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance in the lung administrated with Tet. CONCLUSION: The results indicated the mechanism that tetrandrine effectively reduces hypoxia pulmonary hypertension may be associated with decreasing intracellular calcium concentration in vascular smooth cells, and the effect may be a result of anti-calmodulin activity.
