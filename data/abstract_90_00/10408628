Hot water extract of Chlorella vulgaris (CVE) is a biological response modifier (BRM) which enhances resistance to Listeria monocytogenes through augmentation of helper T cell type 1 (Thl) responses producing gamma-interferon (gammaIFN). We show here that oral administration of CVE in mice suppressed the production of immunoglobulin (Ig)E against casein antigen accompanied by increased gammaIFN and IL-12 mRNA expression. Oral administration of CVE enhanced Thl response to casein in the spleen of casein immunized mice. CVE may be useful for prevention of allergic diseases with a predominant Th2 response.
