The nucleotide sequences of the quinolone resistance-determining regions of the gyrA and parC genes from five ciprofloxacin-resistant strains of Haemophilus influenzae (MICs, 2 to 32 micrograms/ml) isolated from patients with cystic fibrosis and three ciprofloxacin-susceptible strains of H. influenzae (MICs, < or = 0.1 micrograms/ml) were determined. Four of the five resistant strains possessed at least one amino acid substitution in each of the GyrA and ParC fragments studied. The mutations identified in GyrA were a serine at residue 84 (Ser-84) to Leu or Tyr and Asp-88 to Asn or Tyr. ParC mutations were in positions exactly analogous to those identified in GyrA, namely, Ser-84 to Ile and Glu-88 to Lys. The Glu-88 to Lys ParC substitution was identified only in high-level ciprofloxacin-resistant strains. These mutations have been shown to be the origin of the observed resistance after transformation into ciprofloxacin-susceptible H. influenzae isolates. These results suggest that H. influenzae isolates require at least one amino acid substitution in both GyrA and ParC in order to attain significant levels of resistance to quinolones.
