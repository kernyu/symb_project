Medical therapy of chronic hepatitis B aims at halting progression towards cirrhosis/hepatocellular carcinoma by inhibiting replication of hepatitis B virus in a sustained fashion (viral elimination). The sole therapy of proven efficacy is interferon-alpha (5-10 Mio IU sc TIW) which leads within 4 months to viral elimination (seroconversion from HBeAg to anti-HBe-antibody; serum HBV-DNA negative by hybridisation) in approximatively 40% of patients. Interferon-alpha therapy has been shown to decrease hepatitis B associated morbidity/mortality and to be cost-effective. Certain nucleoside analoga such as lamivudine or famciclovir are able to stop hepatitis B virus replication in a large proportion of patients; replication promptly resumes however after cessation of treatment and resistance develops in approximatively 15% of patients treated for one year. The clinical value, in particular for interferon-alpha non-responders, of a combination of interferon-alpha and/or nucleoside analoga remains to be seen.
