OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the short-term effect of dietary counselling in patients with endogenous hypertriglyceridemia and evaluate the effects of advised nutrient changes. DESIGN: A prospective dietary intervention study in patients with endogenous hypertriglyceridemia from January I st 1988 to December 31 st 1996 according to the Dutch guidelines for a healthy diet. Before and after the dietary intervention period of 12 weeks, 24h food recalls were used to assess dietary intake and macronutrient composition. Effectiveness was evaluated by assessment of body weight, serum lipids, lipoproteins and insulin resistance parameters. SETTING: Leiden outpatient Lipid Clinic. SUBJECTS: Forty-five newly diagnosed, untreated patients with endogenous hypertriglyceridemia. RESULTS: A significant reduction in energy intake and body weight as well as changes in macronutrient composition were observed. Total serum triacylglycerol and cholesterol levels decreased by 31% and 15%, respectively. No effects were observed on serum glucose and insulin levels. Weight reduction was significantly correlated with reduction of total plasma triacylglycerol levels and inversely correlated with changes in HDL cholesterol levels. Of all nutrients assessed, only reduction of alcohol intake correlated with improvement of total serum triacylglycerol. CONCLUSIONS: Short-term dietary counselling in patients with endogenous hypertriglyceridemia can effectively improve serum lipid and lipoprotein levels. With regard to the advised nutrient changes, weight loss and limitation of alcohol intake prove to be the best predictors of triacylglycerol reduction.
