A review is given on the situation of resistance in the German cockroach (Blattella germanica) to insecticides during the last 15 years in the GDR, and conclusions are drawn for the future. From 23 samples trapped in various localities and subsequently reared in the laboratory, susceptibilities were measured against lindane, pyrethrin + PBO, trichlorfon, dichlorvos, and propoxur, the most used insecticides against cockroaches in our country. Detection of resistance was done with discriminating doses and the degree of resistance was measured with the doses-mortality method in deposit tests. In no case we found any resistance to propoxur but, for the first time, strains with a low resistance to dichlorvos. There was a distinct increase in the resistance to lindane, trichlorfon and pyrethrins + PBO during the lost years. A strain selected with pyrethrins in the laboratory showed marked group resistance to all tested pyrethroids (permethrin, cyfluthrin, cypermethrin, tetramethrin, deltamethrin, bioresmethrin, bioallethrin), but no cross resistance to the other insecticides.
