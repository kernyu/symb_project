The presence of spontaneous mutational antibiotic resistance among 18 bacteremic isolates of Enterobacter spp. to cefotaxime, ceftazidime, gentamicin, amikacin, ciprofloxacin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was determined quantitatively in vitro using a spiral plater. Each drug was delivered using the device and the agar plates were inoculated in radial streaks. The degree of resistance was estimated by dividing the antimicrobial concentration required to inhibit 90% of the colonies growing in the area beyond the MIC by the MIC itself. The degree of resistance to third-generation cephalosporins and aztreonam was statistically significantly greater than that to co-trimoxazole, imipenem, and ciprofloxacin (P < 0.01); the latter three antibiotics showed virtually no mutational resistance. An intermediate level of resistance was induced by aminoglycosides, and mutational resistance to piperacillin varied between this and the higher levels observed for the cephalosporins. By providing a simple and efficient means of detecting spontaneous mutational resistance, the spiral plater may prove useful in identifying those antimicrobial agents which induce few or no mutants and therefore may be more likely to be successful in treating infections due to Enterobacter spp.
