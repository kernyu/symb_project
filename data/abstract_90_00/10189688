Combination antiretroviral therapy has proven to be the most effective approach to treat HIV disease. The primary goal of treatment for HIV infection is to achieve maximal and durable suppression of viral replication. After decrease of viral load numerical and functional recovery of the immune system is observed and has been associated with better clinical performance of patients. The number of antiretroviral drugs has increased over the last years and currently 12 compounds are available. Wise combinatorial use of these drugs, extensive information and long-term motivation of patients, regular and correct intake are a prerequisition rather than a guarantee of therapy success. These drugs exhibit several class- and substance-specific short-/long-term toxicities, complex pattern of cross-resistance and drug-drug interactions and therefore in depth knowledge of the pharmacology of antiretroviral drugs is mandatory for primary care providers.
