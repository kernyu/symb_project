Pharmacokinetic and clinical studies in pediatrics were performed on panipenem/betamipron (PAPM/BP), a combined drug of a carbapenem antibiotic (panipenem) and organic ion inhibitor (betamipron) at a weight ratio of 1:1. 1. Plasma levels and urinary excretion were studied when PAPM/BP, at 10 mg/10 mg/kg (4 cases) or 20 mg/20 mg/kg (5 cases), was administered using intravenous drip infusion in 30 minutes to 9 children (4-14 years old). The plasma PAPM level at the end of drip infusion was 30.75 +/- 4.98 micrograms/ml in the cases administered with 10 mg/10 mg/kg and 68.72 +/- 5.73 micrograms/ml in the cases administered with 20 mg/20 mg/kg. Drug concentrations then gradually decreased with half-lives of 1.08 +/- 0.09 hours and 0.98 +/- 0.02 hour, and reached 0.39 +/- 0.14 micrograms/ml and 0.62 +/- 0.06 micrograms/ml, respectively, after 5.5 hours. Plasma BP levels at the end of drip infusion was 18.93 +/- 3.75 micrograms/ml in the cases administered 10 mg/10 mg/kg and 37.09 +/- 2.68 micrograms/ml in the cases administered 20 mg/kg, and half-lives were 0.55 +/- 0.07 hour and 0.61 +/- 0.03 hour, respectively; the plasma BP level could not be determined in any cases after 5.5 hours. Mean urinary recovery rates of PAPM in the first 6 hours after the start of intravenous drip infusion were 33.0 +/- 6.1% in the cases administered 10 mg/10 mg/kg and 21.8 +/- 2.3% in the cases administered 20 mg/20 mg/kg and those of BP were 77.0 +/- 2.4% and 76.6 +/- 7.3%, respectively. 2. When PAPM/BP, was administered at 31.3 mg/31.3 mg/kg thought by intravenous drip infusion in 30 minutes to 1 case of purulent meningitis, PAPM levels were 0.76 micrograms/ml at the end of drip infusion but varied between 0.80 to 1.97 micrograms/ml 30 minutes after the end of drip infusion during 8 days of treatment. 3. PAPM/BP was administered to 43 cases, 47 diseases of bacterial infections in the domain of pediatrics to study its clinical efficacy, bacteriological efficacy and adverse reactions. Single doses were 5.2mg/5.2mg to 31.3 mg/31.3 mg/kg; frequencies of administration were 3 to 4 times a day, and durations of administration were 3 1/3 to 11 days; and total dosages ranged between 1.125 g/1.125 g and 11.0 g/11.0 g.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
