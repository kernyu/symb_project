Numerous novel beta-lactamases and aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes with altered substrate profiles continue to be identified. Plasmid-mediated transmission of many of these enzymes readily occurs due to inclusion of the encoding genes in mobile gene cassettes. Recent crystallographic determinations of the structures of metallo-beta-lactamases and aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes provide the opportunity for the rational design of inhibitors.
