The efficacy of the water-soluble derivative (WSD) of natural propolis (bee glue) was examined for augmentation of host resistance against experimental infections caused by Gram-negative pathogens (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa). The substance was found to induce significant non-specific protection, but did not inhibit the in vitro growth of the same strains. Pretreatment with WSD prior to the standard scheme for tumour necrosis factor (TNF) induction (BCG and two weeks later lipopolysaccharide (LPS)) provoked an interval-dependent reduction in the lytic capacity of serum against L 929 target cells. The replacement of the triggering or priming signal with WSD markedly increased TNF production. In vivo administration of WSD led to a rapid and route-dependent change in the alternative complement pathway haemolysis. The alteration in C1q complement component and total protein synthesis, and also in nitroblue tetrazolium reduction, suggests that macrophage activation makes a major contribution to the capacity of WSD to prevent infections.
