BACKGROUND: Atrial natriuretic peptide and cyclosporine have opposing effects on renal hemodynamics and excretory function. METHODS: Twelve male stable cyclosporine-treated renal transplant recipients received a single 100-mg i.v. dose of the neutral endopeptidase EC 24.11 inhibitor candoxatrilat in a double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over study. Each study day consisted of 2 hr of baseline and 7 hr of postdose evaluation. RESULTS: After administration of candoxatrilat, plasma atrial natriuretic factor rose from 12.8+/-1.6 (mean +/- SEM) to 44.1+/-6.8 pmol/L (P<0.001) in association with a threefold increase in urine cGMP excretion (573+/-195 pmol/min baseline to 1823+/-545 pmol/ min; P<0.001), marked natriuresis (207+/-34 micromol/min baseline to 416+/-62 micromol/min; P<0.001), fractional sodium excretion (3.3+/-0.5% baseline to 5.6+/-0.7%; P<0.01), and diuresis (3.4+/-0.5 ml/min baseline to 7.4+/-1 ml/min; P<0.001). All parameters remained elevated above baseline for the remaining 7-hr study period. In response to candoxatrilat, the glomerular filtration rate rose by 19% (P=0.01), renal plasma flow by 7% (P=0.04), renal blood flow by 13% (P=0.03) in association with an increase in filtration fraction from 24+/-2% to 28+/-2% (P=0.002) and small fall in renal vascular resistance from 0.38+/-0.04 to 0.30+/-0.04 mmHg x min x 1.73 m2 x ml(-1) (P=0.02). There was a fall in plasma angiotensin II without a change in plasma renin concentration or plasma aldosterone. Median urinary albumin excretion increased after candoxatrilat administration from 48 (3-131) to 114 (32-641) microg/min (P<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Acute neutral endopeptidase inhibition with candoxatrilat appears to reverse the adverse renal hemodynamic and renal excretory effects of cyclosporine in stable renal transplant recipients.
