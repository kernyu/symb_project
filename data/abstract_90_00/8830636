Clinical isolates of the Herpes simplex virus had different susceptibility to acyclovir. Along with highly susceptible variants there were often isolated resistant variants and variants with intermediate susceptibility to the drug. All the clinical isolates were from the patients previously not treated with acyclovir. Therefore, it is possible to consider the drug resistance of the Herpes simplex virus to be natural. Two cultures of the virus differing in their susceptibility to acyclovir were simultaneously isolated from the affections of various localization in one patient. The study of the time course of the resistance development in the cell cultures showed that it depended on the drug dose and the subculture level. It is advisable to test the isolates of the Herpes simplex virus for their susceptibility to drugs used in the patient treatment. This will provide individual therapy of the patients with Herpes simplex.
