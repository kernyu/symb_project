We have constructed a panel of human x murine microcell hybrids containing individual human chromosomes tagged with a dual selectable marker conferring hygromycin B resistance and ganciclovir sensitivity. Over 500 independent microcell hybrids (B78MC) were generated and more than 200 individually isolated. We have identified the human chromosome content of several B78MC hybrids and verified that the majority are responsive to positive and negative selection. Once fully characterized, this panel will be useful in the study of dominant regulators of gene activity, such as tissue specific regulators and tumor suppressor genes.
