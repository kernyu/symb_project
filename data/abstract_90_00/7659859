The Enterococcus flora of duck intestines consisted of E faecalis and E faecium in ducklings less than eight weeks old and E faecalis, E faecium and E gallinarum in ducks more than eight weeks old. The enterococci were resistant to several antibiotics; chloramphenicol and gentamycin sulphate were the only antibiotics of those tested which were moderately effective. All the Enterococcus species isolates were resistant to the macrolide and lincosamide antibiotics.
