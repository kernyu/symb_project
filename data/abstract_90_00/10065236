In newborn children from HIV-infected women early establishment of HIV infection is of importance for optimal therapy of HIV-infected children and avoidance of unnecessary medication in uninfected children. A more than 95% reliable diagnosis of HIV infection can now be obtained at the age of four weeks by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology. Before this age a positive PCR result is relevant since it necessitates additional investigation such as measuring anti-HIV drug resistance and may lead to modification of anti-HIV treatment. Prophylaxis against Pneumocystis carinii is not needed if HIV infection can not be demonstrated by PCR after the age of four weeks.
