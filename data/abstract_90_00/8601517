The aim of this study was to evaluate in vitro a possible mechanism involved in the antimicrobial action of calcium hydroxide, namely absorption of carbon dioxide from the root canal. Twenty obligate and 20 facultative anaerobic bacteria isolated from infected root canals and identified to species level were used. For each bacterial species a standard concentration was achieved and 0.1 ml of the inoculum was spread on blood agar plates, which were consecutively incubated in an anaerobic chamber for 5-7 days. One experimental and one control group were studied: the experimental group included one plate with the bacterial species as well as one open plate containing 32 g calcium hydroxide paste at a mixing ratio of 6:4. Both plates were incubated in an anaerobic chamber for 72 h. The control group included only one plate containing the same bacterial species and was incubated under the same conditions. After a 72-h incubation, the number of the recovered bacteria were counted in both groups. Statistical analysis showed that the number of bacteria recovered from the control group was significantly lower than that of the experimental group, but no particular resistance of any bacterial species to calcium hydroxide could be detected. This finding strongly suggests that the ability of calcium hydroxide to absorb carbon dioxide may contribute to its antibacterial activity.
