We studied the susceptibility of antimicrobial agents to Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (S. epidermidis) isolated from acne patients. We measured the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of the following five drugs: roxithromycin (RXM), erythromycin (EM), clindamycin (CLDM), minocycline (MINO) and ofloxacin (OFLX), which are frequently used to treat acne and skin infections. We found many resistant strains of S. epidermidis and some resistant strains of P. acnes. There was a correlation between the resistance of S. epidermidis and the former therapy for acne, but no distinct correlation between the resistance of P. acnes and the former therapy for acne.
