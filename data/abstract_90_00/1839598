Transfer of the conjugative plasmid G873 on filters and mixed cultivation of the donor and recipient cells in liquid media is described. In the both systems the use of the lysogenic recipient cells (phages of serogroups B and F) in the crossings increased mor than 100-fold the frequency of plasmid transfer. The conjugative transfer of the plasmid in the mixed cultivation system was proved. The conjugative transfer required the presence (while not obligatory) of calcium chloride and was restricted by the serum factors.
