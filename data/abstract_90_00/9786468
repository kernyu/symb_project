The comparative in-vitro activity of HMR 3647, a new ketolide antibiotic, was investigated against 492 clinical isolates of gram-positive bacteria, including multiply resistant strains, by an agar-dilution technique. All streptococci tested were inhibited by the new ketolide at concentrations < or = 0.5 mg/L. HMR 3647 was more potent than erythromycin against staphylococci. For enterococci the new compound yielded an MIC90 of 8 mg/L. Erysipelothrix spp., Pediococcus spp., Leuconostoc spp., Lactobacillus spp., JK diphtheroids and Listeria monocytogenes were also susceptible to the new ketolide.
