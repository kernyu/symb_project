L1210 cell lines selected for resistance to deoxyadenosine exhibit altered steady-state levels of the mRNA for the early response genes and p53. In the deoxyadenosine-resistant cell lines (Y8 and ED2), the levels of the mRNAs for p53 and c-jun were markedly decreased while the steady-state levels for mRNAs for c-myc, c-fos and jun B were elevated in the Y-8 and ED2 cell lines. The levels of the mRNAs for PCNA and c-myb were the same in the wild type and mutant cell lines. The levels of the mRNAs for krox-24 were extremely low in the wild type and mutant cell lines. Cycloheximide (CHX) treatment of the cells resulted in the increase in the mRNA levels for c-jun, jun B, krox 24 and p53 in the Y-8 and ED2 cell lines. The time courses and the extents of the increases in the mRNA levels following CHX treatment were not the same for all of these mRNAs. The level of p53 RNA increased with no lag following CHX treatment while the levels of the mRNAs for c-myc, c-jun and krox-24 increased after a one-hour lag period. The level of the mRNA for p53 and c-myc increased 20- and 7-fold, respectively while the mRNA level for knox-24 increased 80-fold following CHX treatment. The Y8 and ED2 cell lines that lack steady-state levels of p53 show decreased sensitivity to cisplatin and increased frequency of gene amplification as measured by PALA resistance in a manner similar to other cell lines lacking p53. On the other hand, the ED2 and Y8 cell lines do not show a G1-block in response to PALA treatment. The cell lines appear to offer an experimental system in which to study the interactions between/among these early response genes and the p53-dependent and independent pathways.
