An arbitrarily primed polymerase chain reaction (AP-PCR) DNA profile was applied to epidemiological analysis of Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Enteritidis. A total 21 strains of S. Enteritidis isolated from 21 cases (10 cases of healthy persons, 7 cases of food poisoning outbreaks and 4 sporadic diarrhea cases), during the period between December 1991 and August 1996 in Wakayama City, were used. A total of 60 arbitrary primers (DNA oligomer (12) set, Wako) were screened with 4 S. Enteritidis strains of different cases. A-11, B-32, C-42 and C-45 primers were chosen. Plasmid DNA profiles, antimicrobial susceptibility patterns and phage types were also examined. The combination of these three methods resolved the collection into five groups (A to E). And type C strains were found in 17 cases (81%) out of 21 cases. However, according to AP-PCR DNA profile, all 21 strains were classified into six groups (I to VI), and 17 type C strains were classified into three groups (III, IV and V). Type IV was predominant in Wakayama City, and type C.IV was found in 15 cases (71%). In conclusion, we considered that AP-PCR DNA profile using appropriate primers was an effective epidemiological marker.
