Present and future solutions to the problem of bacterial multiple resistance involve physicians, patients and veterinarians. Their behaviour should evolve to take into account the medical and economical issues of antibiotic prescription. The clinical diagnosis requires a more rigorous assessment, based on bacteriological and rapid antigenic tests. Vaccination in both young people and the elderly, is an essential prophylactic tool, which is too often neglected. When a bacterial infection is suspected or proven, priority should be given to a targeted antimicrobial therapy with a bactericidal activity, in order to quickly eradicate pathogens. Therapies should be shorter and questionable antibio-prophylaxis should also be avoided. A watch laboratory network should provide physicians with an adequate information on local bacterial resistance patterns on a regular basis, in order to allow them adjusting their prescription.
