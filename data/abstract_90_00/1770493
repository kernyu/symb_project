A veld ram performance testing unit consists of an association of stud or commercial ram breeders, who compare the performance of selected rams under field conditions on common pastures. The best performers are subsequently auctioned at public sales. To date, at least 10 Merino veld ram clubs have been established in various centres in South Africa. A strain of Haemonchus contortus, which was isolated from the pastures of one of these performance testing units, was found to be resistant to ivermectin, oxfendazole and rafoxanide. Closantel, levamisole and disophenol were more than 99% effective. The wide dispersal of the rams after testing, constitutes a potential danger for dissemination of helminths with resistant genes. Precautionary methods should include careful routine monitoring of drug susceptibility on the communal pastures, on the farms of individual members and thorough deworming of rams before they leave the testing unit. The prevention and control of resistance in such testing units are discussed, but it is emphasised that this is difficult, particularly if the worm strains on the communal grazing have become resistant to some of the anthelmintic groups.
