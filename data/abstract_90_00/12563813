AIM: To observe the variation in resistance of Plasmodium falciparum after the cessation of chloroquine medication. METHODS: WHO standard in vitro microtest and in vivo test were used. RESULTS: In vitro test showed that the rate of chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum dropped from 97.9% in 1981 to 26.7% in 1997 (P < 0.001). The mean concentration of chloroquine for complete inhibition of schizont formation declined from 10.46 +/- 7.14 pmol/ul blood in 1981 to 1.63 +/- 1.47 pmol/microliter blood in 1997(P < 0.001). In vivo test showed that the rate of chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum decreased from 84.2% in 1981 to 18.4% in 1997(P < 0.001). The proportion of R III cases to the total resistant cases dropped from 53.1% in 1981 to 14.3% in 1997. CONCLUSION: A tendency of progressive decline of resistance of the parasite was revealed after the cessation of chloroquine medication.
