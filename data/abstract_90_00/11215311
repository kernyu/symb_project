Balhimycin and desglucobalhimycin are glycopeptide antibiotics isolated from an Amycolatopsis spp during the search for novel antibacterials against MRSA from the natural product screening at the Research Centre of formerly Hoechst India Ltd. in Bombay, India. Both compounds show excellent in vitro activity against methicillin sensitive and resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA, MRSA). Both compounds were also found to be active against a number of MRSA strain in the animal studies. The activities were comparable to that of the reference glycopeptides vancomycin and teicoplanin used in these studies. Teicoplanin displayed better in vivo efficacy against S. epidermidis 4929H and Streptococcus pyogenes A77 than either vancomycin or desgluco-balhimycin in the present study. Preliminary studies on pharmacokinetic and acute toxicity were done to get some idea at the early stage of the investigation about the promise of the compounds for development.
