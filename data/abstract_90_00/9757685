Generation of strains resistant to antibiotics, its genetic mechanisms and the role of incompetent administration of these drugs are presented in the paper. The resistance is characterised mainly by the generation of extracellular enzymes which cause the breakdown of beta-lactam ring Pathogenic bacteria which cause changes in the respiratory system are discussed. The use of beta-lactam antibiotics with beta-lactam inhibitors is a way to prevent generation of resistant strains, the combination of amoxycillin and clavulanic acid is of particular importance.
