Among the hapalosin derivatives synthesized, the compounds carrying methyl (5a), methylthioethyl (5d) and phenylmethyl (5e) groups at the C12 position possess only the cis-peptide structure, in contrast to the cases of 5b and 5c. In addition to their conformational stability, the biological activities of the compounds were determined in relation of the P-glycoprotein-mediated MDR-reversing activity and induction of apoptosis.
