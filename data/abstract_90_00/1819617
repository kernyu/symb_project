In previous investigations we considered the increasing resistance of Gram-negative organisms to aminoglycosides over time. We therefore performed further studies to evaluate eventual variations in the incidence of bacterial resistance to aminoglycosides over the last four years. We tested Gram-negative microorganisms recently isolated from pathological materials of various clinical origins with gentamicin, amikacin, tobramycin and netilmicin. Our data show evidence that there was no significant increasing resistance to aminoglycosides, and that netilmicin continues to be active as an anti-Gram-negative antibiotic.
