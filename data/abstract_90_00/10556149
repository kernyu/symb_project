In the present study we have investigated the mechanisms of pulmonary edema caused by platelet-activating factor (PAF) in isolated rat lungs as well as in mice in vivo. In blood-free perfused and ventilated rat lungs, PAF increased lung weight by 0.59 +/- 0.18 g. The cyclooxygenase inhibitor aspirin (500 microM) blocked this response by one-third, and the quinolines quinine (330 microM), quinidine (100 microM), and chloroquine (100 microM) by two-thirds. Lipoxygenase inhibition (10 microM AA861) alone or in combination with thromboxane receptor antagonism (10 microM SQ29548) had no effect on PAF-induced weight gain. In combination with aspirin, quinine or quinidine completely prevented PAF-induced weight gain and the concomitant increase of the capillary filtration coefficient (K(f,c)). Pretreatment with quinine in vivo prevented not only PAF-, but also endotoxin-induced edema formation as assessed by Evans Blue extravasation. In addition, in vivo quinine prevented the endotoxin-induced release of tumor neurosis factor (TNF). Furthermore, in perfused lungs quinine reduced the PAF-induced increases in airway and vascular resistance, as well as thromboxane release. These findings demonstrate the following anti-inflammatory properties of quinolines: reduction of thromboxane and TNF formation; reduction of PAF-induced vasoconstriction and bronchoconstriction; and attenuation of PAF- and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced edema formation. We conclude that the PAF- induced edema consists of two separate mechanisms, one dependent on an unknown cyclooxygenase metabolite, the other one sensitive to quinolines.
