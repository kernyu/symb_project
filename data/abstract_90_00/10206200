Florfenicol, a drug effective against several bacterial diseases of fish, was tested for possible immunomodulatory effects. The aim of the study was to follow the kinetics of the immune response after vaccination with simultaneous oral antibiotic treatment. The fish were immunised with a commercial oil-based divalent (furunculosis/vibriosis) vaccine and were simultaneously given oral antibiotic treatment. The specific immune response was monitored by analysing the levels of specific antibodies with ELISA. As an indicator of the non-specific immune response the phagocytic activity of circulating leucocytes was measured by a chemiluminescence assay. Total circulating leucocyte counts and differentials were also monitored. The disease resistance was evaluated by challenge tests at the end of the experiment. The results showed that florfenicol did not have any significant effect on antibody production and circulating leucocyte levels but caused a suppression in chemiluminescence response/phagocytic cell 5-6 weeks after vaccination. The survival after challenge was slightly suppressed by the florfenicol treatment. The RPS-value for the vaccinated group was 98% and for the florfenicol-treated group was 88%.
