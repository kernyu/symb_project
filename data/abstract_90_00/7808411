In contrast to its behavior in tobacco and tomato, the maize transposable element Ac is relatively inactive in Arabidopsis. We show here that removal of 537 bp within a CpG-rich region of the Ac 5' untranslated leader region significantly increases the excision frequency of the element in Arabidopsis. This increase did not appear to be correlated with the removal of sequences that are methylated in inactive Ac elements in maize, as these sites were not methylated in Ac elements in Arabidopsis transformants. The deletion within the 5' untranslated leader did not increase Ac activity by increasing levels of steady-state transposase mRNA, as assayed by RNase protection experiments. Moreover, there was no correlation between the levels of steady-state transposase mRNA and Ac element activity. This suggests that post-transcriptional regulation of Ac activity occurs in Arabidopsis.
