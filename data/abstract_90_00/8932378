Deletions and rearrangements of DNA sequences within the genome of human cells result in mutations associated with human disease. We have developed a selection system involving a neo gene containing a DNA sequence inserted into the NcoI site that can be used to quantitatively assay deletion of this sequence from the chromosome. The spontaneous deletion from the neo gene of a 122 bp inverted repeat occurred at a rate of 2.1 x 10(-8) to <3.1 x 10(-9) revertants/cell/generation in three different cell lines. Deletion of the 122 bp inverted repeat occurred between 6 bp flanking direct repeats. Spontaneous deletion of a 122 bp non-palindromic DNA sequence flanked by direct repeats was not observed, indicating a rate of deletion of <3.1 x 10(-9) revertants/cell/generation. This result demonstrates that a 122 bp inverted repeat can exhibit a low level of instability in some locations in the chromosome of a human cell line.
