Quinolone resistance in clinical isolates of Campylobacter jejuni in Sweden increased more than 20-fold at the beginning of the 1990s. Resistance to 125 microgram of ciprofloxacin per ml in clinical isolates was associated with chromosomal mutations in C. jejuni leading to a Thr-86-Ile substitution in the gyrA product and a Arg-139-Gln substitution in the parC product.
