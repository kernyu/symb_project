Rifampin has very broad antimicrobial properties with in vitro activities against many bacteria, mycobacteria, higher bacteria, chlamydia, fungi, parasites, and viruses (Table 1). The clinical use of rifampin is more limited, in part because of the lack of in vivo human clinical studies demonstrating its efficacy. Investigators have valid concerns regarding the emergence of resistance of mycobacteria if widespread use of rifampin becomes common, although this has not been well documented. Because rifampin obtains therapeutic levels intracellularly and is distributed widely throughout the body, the antibiotic potentially could be used on a broader scale, but more studies will be needed to demonstrate its clinical utility.
