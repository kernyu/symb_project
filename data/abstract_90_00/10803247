The susceptibility to selected chemotherapeutic agents was determined in 100 strains of Staphylococcus aureus methicillin-resistant (MRSA) isolated from clinical materials in 1991-1992 (50 strains) and in 1997 (50 strains). Two methods were used for the determination: disc method and antibiotic dilution in agar. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined for vancomycin, teicoplanin, furazolidone, nitrofurantoin, ofloxacin, gentamicin, netilmicin and trimethoprim. The concentrations of the chemotherapeutics in the substrate ranged from 0.125 to 512 mg/l. The obtained results served for drawing of the following conclusions: all studied MRSA strains isolated in 1991-1992 and in 1997 were sensitive to glycopeptide antibiotics: vancomycin and teicoplanin, to nitrofurans: nitrofurantoin and furazolidone, and to fusidic acid. MRSA strains isolated in 1991-1992 were sensitive to ofloxacin, but in 1997 about 80% of the strains were resistant to that antibiotic, and this resistance was noted in S. aureus strains with homogeneous resistance to methicillin. Increasing frequency of resistance to mupirocin was found, in 1991-1992 4% of the strains were resistant, and in 1997 the resistance of MRSA to that antibiotic was found in 12%. No changes occurred in the sensitivity of staphylococci to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (cotrimoxazole). About 94% of strains in 1991-1992 and 1997 were sensitive to that drug. The sensitivity to cotrimoxazole is connected with one of its components (trimethoprim), with 94% of MRSA strains sensitive to it.
