A cosmid clone from an oleandomycin producer, Streptomyces antibioticus, contains a large open reading frame encoding a type I polyketide synthase subunit and an oleandomycin resistance gene (oleB). Sequencing of a 1.4-kb DNA fragment adjacent to oleB revealed the existence of an open reading frame (oleP) encoding a protein similar to several cytochrome P450 monooxygenases from different sources, including the products of the eryF and eryK genes from Saccharopolyspora erythraea that participate in erythromycin biosynthesis. The oleP gene was expressed in Escherichia coli as a fusion protein to a maltose-binding protein. Using polyclonal antibodies against this fusion protein it was observed that the synthesis of the cytochrome P450 was in parallel to that of oleandomycin. The cytochrome P450 encoded by the oleP gene could be responsible for the epoxidation of carbon 8 of the oleandomycin lactone ring.
